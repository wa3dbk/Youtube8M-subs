00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:11.639
 [Music] 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.289
 Foliatec at the tuning world 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.360
 Lake Constance, there are films from the 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:16.410
 spray can relatively quickly 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.169
 made within a half 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.910
 hour can thus do everything what 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:23.430
 you want to marry somehow at his 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.579
 dare rims rearview mirror smaller 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.160
 highlights were, as I said costs 50 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:31.320
 euro and is about in 30 minutes 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.700
 ready for use and if it then after the 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.989
 Season does not look that good anymore 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.969
 It can also be easily recovered 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.320
 remove 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:41.219
 We thought about it for a long time like we did 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:45.600
 best and easiest for the 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:49.760
 solve customers and that's us here 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.760
 most sensible idea 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:57.820
 Since I have every time the cards 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.489
 are suitable for the operation of the two 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.870
 big talk for a set of rims and 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.320
 After that , of course, are full of color and 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.030
 then you should throw them away 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.890
 the rim is degreased they see the 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.229
 cards are plugged around so that 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.540
 a funnel arises naturally 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.060
 especially good then good 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.540
 Protected the tire well protected 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.790
 spray 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.580
 an important point before you start 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.750
 Is the can really shake well then 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:28.720
 The film is of course as a basis 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.190
 rubber say rubber and the in 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.619
 connection with various solvents 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.240
 and so on, that is what it means 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.369
 Shake before use is very important 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.580
 just to all particles in the 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.280
 contents are lightening up and too 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.290
 unfold 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.360
 you can already see the colleague of 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.899
 Wears the first step we say 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:53.259
 beautiful, careful and fine cloister 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.610
 neatly covering it is all over 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.920
 important that one that of course 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.270
 not too much in one place stays around 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.479
 to prevent runners is like at 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.909
 a conventional paint spray and she 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:07.600
 already see a property is that 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:09.729
 the foil very well covers now is the 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.769
 first layer applied and you should 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.989
 let it air for two minutes 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:17.170
 Just a short time to dry 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:20.049
 ensure then the second layer 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:24.220
 on the complete set for four rims 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:25.780
 costs 49 95 and as we said before 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.660
 have everything you need for that 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.209
 that is, buy it and get going on for 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.290
 ask all inclusive so to speak I have to 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.100
 you can choose a lot of driving 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.329
 now 28 of the newest 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.410
 we also highlight here 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.600
 will present if ours 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.269
 stand is finished is neon 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.190
 that's why we have them here in ours 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.450
 eat motorcycle still ready because 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.150
 Someone is interested in taking pictures 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.579
 make that would be an orange and neon yellow 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.840
 and in addition a third neon green the 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:54.459
 now have here and not installed 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.410
 it so the latest color trends and 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.300
 overall as I said 28 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.190
 Of course, the school is very clear 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.040
 designed for the temporary for the 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.810
 temporary use and we are always 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.920
 very careful with the statement as 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.410
 long it stops because we have of course 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.210
 Customers were already in order this year 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.370
 And we have customers as only three months 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.380
 depending on how often you will be in 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.750
 How often do you use the washing machine? 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.970
 curb but in the normal case we say 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.710
 A season is definitely so too 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.180
 the product is designed ie you do it 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.130
 maybe in march depending on the weather or 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.290
 in april the summer wheels on it 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.440
 just fancy those in red or orange dull 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.060
 as now the colleague sprayed to drive 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.170
 and changes in october again 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.580
 winter is the way it is the product 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.050
 Actually, she then designs the film 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.370
 Again the question is as before and 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.560
 all is well 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.950
 and in the next season you do it 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.090
 red black and then just pulls 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.220
 in a slip off or I have to 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.710
 we'll kick it or come later 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.520
 even more the lady would us then 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.980
 show briefly 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:55.210
 So it comes in large pieces down in 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.950
 in the whole who who art artwork but 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:00.580
 It is not a thunderstorm but it works 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.260
 already in big pieces down 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.910
 further trends are developing at the moment 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.550
 is the first idea as I said 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:09.190
 to shape rims in color and the 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.110
 just back again is to have cash and 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.300
 meanwhile also becomes for 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.120
 Body parts mirror anyway 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.919
 spoiler used just because of the 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.660
 Trend colored mirror or mine 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.430
 Colored accent somewhere in the car too 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.880
 Big is the vehicle manufacturer 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.680
 do it 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.020
 meanwhile yellow with yellow rims 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.509
 Mirror in the package to order and that 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.349
 of course always costs right 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:31.949
 Joie de vivre is there the cheaper 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:34.520
 alternative 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:37.319
 So where do I get the product from him ? 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.780
 of course, in the course of today 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:42.810
 internet but also in every good 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.940
 assorted specialist dealers atu stahlgruber 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.800
 So all those big car accessories 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.240
 Traders have it in the program 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.240
 meanwhile even at obi 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:05:01.330
 the question is again 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.420
 [Music] 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.620
 si 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.730
 [Music] 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:11.990
 other men keep us the door receives 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:17.420
 me the rim is but that goes itself 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:19.100
 for not really muscular and so 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.530
 People grabbed me that goes here 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.540
 relatively simple is not like at 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.430
 the plaque you see in switzerland or 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:28.960
 in Austria again and again 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:33.010
 jiggle apart so that's good 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.010
 and is also available at obi
