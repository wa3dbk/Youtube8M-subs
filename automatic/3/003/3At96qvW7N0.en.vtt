00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:06.090
 lee 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.090
 late 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.210
 after then 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:31.419
 used to be 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.900
 Hey 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.480
 last week in after the conversation and I think it gave a wonderful feeling 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.410
 to the implementation and 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.310
 the reason why she has a few euros leave I believe the smelly best 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.250
 do to the eye of the play 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.660
 And then I hope it can be refused 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.750
 and now of course I am very curious how it works performed live 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.760
 I think the implementation will be the most important thing 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.490
 that also turned out to be a shortage that is a powerful feeling 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.250
 that high 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.049
 late 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:36.060
 it was that the assignment was to do something with the bonus of being 42 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.840
 so then you read that text, you start thinking about what I want with this one 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.350
 text 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.049
 at the beginning it does not stop we get martin mart in my head 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:47.810
 accompaniment 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.229
 I thought I should start from there, so I noted you a mate 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.440
 I left it undisturbed for weeks and then I got it in a few 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.440
 days on conversation 

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:10.769
 if i would win i would i really want to 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.010
 to be very pleased that there is a professional jury that you have 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.599
 find my piece worthwhile 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:21.590
 I have read and who the jury members are and who 8 I play music as a hobby that 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.590
 just read a head full once it sounds 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.159
 mail 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:38.680
 Didier Reynders in the waiting room is always waiting for a little guy 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.680
 means that it is a game for the leader 

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:57.359
 what 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:00.749
 considering the on paper but in the christmas night league that's one anyway 

00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:03.539
 division 2 

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:06.539
 Justice sees me as a happy Christmas 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:08.999
 so you had chances 

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:11.999
 3 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:20.699
 all already 

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:22.869
 as 

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.409
 these are life 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:27.819
 she received the audience award who is going home with it 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:29.319
 this question 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:30.209
 on the basis of 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.499
 the artist's competition I don't see you often 

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:36.499
 9 

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:47.829
 I think it is okay he is very suitable as an office drive 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:51.279
 it is easy to implement I also do not use much politics 

00:03:51.279 --> 00:03:55.619
 so for others it is always difficult even stronger at van 

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:59.059
 from colleagues in the morning 

00:03:59.059 --> 00:04:01.159
 that are very difficult 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:04.870
 and I also find that very intriguing, but that is not so in my way 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.870
 of writing 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:12.779
 I am here today signed by the thinkers 

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:15.779
 6 2013 but 

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:17.909
 that is going to work 

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:18.930
 this vision 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.180
 the first victory for the tukkers 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.419
 the results 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.599
 end of 2013 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:29.680
 a petition 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.680
 we stand 

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:39.049
 it has always been my aim to pond accessible music too 

00:04:39.049 --> 00:04:39.840
 performance 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.770
 That also feels nice to do churches in the fitness center happy 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.720
 community in the sense of the patents carried out by good organizers 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.720
 be it is for the ordinary people 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:54.639
 yes I am very happy I think so 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:58.029
 I have said it for a long time and a lot of liturgical music 

00:04:58.029 --> 00:05:01.219
 it is very beautiful that is 

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:02.629
 9 with 

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:05.379
 the bike which I, however, continue to appreciate
