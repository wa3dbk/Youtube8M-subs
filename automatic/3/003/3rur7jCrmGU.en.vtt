00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.150
 Hello guys free topics on 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.430
 agenda news I'm pretty good today 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.910
 prepared for you i have art two 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:27.660
 new tank is mitosis then they up to 150 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.040
 literally the other day began to be known 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.110
 the smallest characteristics I would say 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.579
 you know very much 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.140
 beggarly but nonetheless there is already 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.180
 first screenshots have some 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.270
 information which today I will try to 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:43.570
 I bring you and take me to 100 it with us 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:46.390
 level 5 tank weight 100 tons i.e. 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.550
 at the fifth level already 100 tons yes guys 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.850
 fully justify the stereotypes that 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.460
 go about these tanks that the Japanese are the same 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.829
 they will be just huge there on 5 shafts 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.190
 will mouse and ride that is what 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:04.420
 Saying to the sixth caught us already here 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:07.120
 150 tons 150 tons guys what about 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.100
 this is 100 and so is our gun 75 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.900
 millimeters those are five or 105 and 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.730
 millimeter howitzer 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:19.270
 Well, that is, we make our way to 124 Gold 155 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.770
 and you're from 8 millimeters hotel 38 for 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.060
 seventy five millimeter cannon 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:27.579
 7570 70 well by the way for 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:31.240
 level five booking else where 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:34.329
 no gun was relatively good for 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.540
 level five, I think that 124 punch 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:40.299
 this is enough with the head as they write about what 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.939
 there is a site moderator with which I am very 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:45.250
 I always take the information this tanks mid 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:47.950
 crew of 11 people 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.189
 but I personally think that in a number of wargaming 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.759
 in general, it can all be realized 11 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:54.880
 person 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:57.219
 the tank has four towers of which in 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.979
 In general, it will be only the main 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:02.469
 could was can only be fired from 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.780
 The main multi-turret is not yet completely 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:07.299
 realized she tests very unlikely 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.070
 it will in general that it is implemented 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:12.010
 in Japanese tanks although we see that 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:14.410
 tower of the day in general towers can here 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.740
 say with your head next so this 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.050
 level six and this is metal 150 know 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.180
 why is called mitol 150 up because 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.670
 that the weight of this tank is 150 tons 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.739
 no characteristics visible but we 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.129
 we see that there is so little here 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.849
 plump no said not so virgin 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:35.109
 cannon 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:37.099
 it is obvious that this is possible too 105 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:39.010
 millimeter howitzer 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.810
 them or maybe even more 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.030
 high-calorie fagasnitsa that is, you need 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.849
 wait guys show characteristic 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.040
 this is not depend on me as much as possible 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.319
 all the information that I wanted to tell you a secret wasps 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.420
 in general , as you see, well, tank 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.909
 extremely unusual he again has two 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.099
 towers with penza the main tower is another 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:59.169
 back tower 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:01.689
 booking again unknown 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:04.129
 information appeared just the other day 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:06.290
 just yesterday they began to beat 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:08.620
 the characteristics of this tank the day before yesterday 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.969
 characteristics were known tanks 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.370
 for now we will expect us 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:15.230
 will present wargaming further I think that 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.459
 Our days will be known characteristics 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:23.120
 seventh levels 7 8 and maybe even 9 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:26.810
