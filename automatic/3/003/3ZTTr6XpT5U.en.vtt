00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.069 
chocolate into that we're gonna whisk
this<00:01:35.820> together<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.360> what<00:01:36.509> we<00:01:36.600> need<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.780> do<00:01:36.960> at

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
this together and what we need to do at

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.020 
this together and what we need to do at
this<00:01:37.200> point<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:37.829> bring<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.310> boil<00:01:38.549> so

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
this point is I bring this to a boil so

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.700 
this point is I bring this to a boil so
it's<00:01:39.240> gonna<00:01:39.390> actually<00:01:39.570> take<00:01:39.900> about<00:01:40.200> 4<00:01:40.590> or<00:01:40.619> 5

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
it's gonna actually take about 4 or 5

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.109 
it's gonna actually take about 4 or 5
minutes<00:01:41.189> just<00:01:41.369> make<00:01:41.549> sure<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:41.850> keep<00:01:42.060> stirring

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
minutes just make sure you keep stirring

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.719 
minutes just make sure you keep stirring
it<00:01:42.659> throughout<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.079> process<00:01:43.259> we<00:01:43.740> need<00:01:43.920> 3<00:01:44.490> egg

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
it throughout the process we need 3 egg

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.330 
it throughout the process we need 3 egg
yolks<00:01:44.759> for<00:01:45.329> this<00:01:45.479> sorption<00:01:45.869> we<00:01:46.829> want<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.070> bring

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
yolks for this sorption we want to bring

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.889 
yolks for this sorption we want to bring
the<00:01:47.549> temperature<00:01:47.909> of<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.060> eggs<00:01:48.270> closer<00:01:48.689> to

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
the temperature of the eggs closer to

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.690 
the temperature of the eggs closer to
the<00:01:49.020> temperature<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.470> our<00:01:49.530> pie<00:01:49.799> filling<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.399> way

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
the temperature of our pie filling a way

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.969 
the temperature of our pie filling a way
to<00:01:50.759> do<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.119> is<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.750> add<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:51.990> small<00:01:52.530> amount<00:01:52.860> of

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
to do that is to add a small amount of

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.399 
to do that is to add a small amount of
your<00:01:53.159> pie<00:01:53.369> filling<00:01:53.759> directly<00:01:54.149> into<00:01:54.540> your<00:01:55.259> egg

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
your pie filling directly into your egg

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.850 
your pie filling directly into your egg
yolks<00:01:56.090> just<00:01:57.090> mix<00:01:57.270> them<00:01:57.390> up<00:01:57.479> at<00:01:58.079> this<00:01:58.259> point<00:01:58.500> I'm

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
yolks just mix them up at this point I'm

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.679 
yolks just mix them up at this point I'm
going<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.250> relight<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.119> fire<00:02:00.149> and

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689 
going to relight the fire and

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
comes back to a boil we have one more

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.100 
comes back to a boil we have one more
minute<00:02:06.009> of<00:02:06.340> boiling<00:02:06.789> and<00:02:07.210> literally<00:02:07.930> going<00:02:08.050> to

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
minute of boiling and literally going to

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.830 
minute of boiling and literally going to
turn<00:02:08.349> the<00:02:08.440> heat<00:02:08.590> off<00:02:08.649> and<00:02:09.039> add<00:02:09.640> one<00:02:10.360> tablespoon

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840

of butter and one and a half teaspoons

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.250 
of butter and one and a half teaspoons
of<00:02:14.170> vanilla<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:15.760> that<00:02:15.970> is<00:02:16.209> yeah<00:02:16.840> we<00:02:17.050> have<00:02:17.230> a

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
of vanilla and that is yeah we have a

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.979 
of vanilla and that is yeah we have a
pie<00:02:17.440> filling<00:02:17.800> right<00:02:18.760> now<00:02:18.940> we're<00:02:19.269> gonna<00:02:19.360> put<00:02:19.900> it

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
pie filling right now we're gonna put it

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.770 
pie filling right now we're gonna put it
right<00:02:20.019> into<00:02:20.380> our<00:02:20.410> pie<00:02:20.620> shell<00:02:20.650> I<00:02:21.480> also<00:02:22.480> like<00:02:22.690> to

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
right into our pie shell I also like to

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.600 
right into our pie shell I also like to
pour<00:02:23.019> this<00:02:23.140> in<00:02:23.349> right<00:02:23.650> in<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:23.920> middle<00:02:24.870> and

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
pour this in right in the middle and

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.339 
pour this in right in the middle and
that<00:02:27.610> way<00:02:27.730> you<00:02:27.790> can<00:02:28.000> really<00:02:28.480> get<00:02:28.660> a<00:02:28.870> lot<00:02:28.900> of<00:02:29.200> pie

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
that way you can really get a lot of pie

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:30.839 
that way you can really get a lot of pie
filling<00:02:29.410> in<00:02:29.800> as<00:02:30.010> it<00:02:30.160> settles<00:02:30.489> towards<00:02:30.760> the

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
filling in as it settles towards the

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:32.520 
filling in as it settles towards the
edge<00:02:30.970> we're<00:02:31.480> gonna<00:02:31.569> go<00:02:31.959> ahead<00:02:32.050> and<00:02:32.200> just<00:02:32.410> let

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
edge we're gonna go ahead and just let

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.870 
edge we're gonna go ahead and just let
this<00:02:32.709> cool<00:02:32.950> down<00:02:33.160> to<00:02:33.310> room<00:02:33.340> temperature<00:02:33.730> for

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
this cool down to room temperature for

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.460 
this cool down to room temperature for
about<00:02:34.269> a<00:02:34.299> half<00:02:34.510> an<00:02:34.630> hour<00:02:34.750> just<00:02:35.140> so<00:02:35.200> it's<00:02:35.349> not

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
about a half an hour just so it's not

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.750 
about a half an hour just so it's not
steaming<00:02:35.830> and<00:02:36.069> then<00:02:36.250> we're<00:02:36.340> gonna<00:02:36.430> throw<00:02:36.519> it

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
steaming and then we're gonna throw it

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.339 
steaming and then we're gonna throw it
in<00:02:36.849> the<00:02:36.940> refrigerator<00:02:37.060> let<00:02:37.989> it<00:02:38.140> chill<00:02:38.290> in

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
in the refrigerator let it chill in

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:39.630 
in the refrigerator let it chill in
there<00:02:38.620> for<00:02:38.830> about<00:02:38.890> another<00:02:39.040> hour<00:02:39.310> and<00:02:39.430> a<00:02:39.489> half

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
there for about another hour and a half

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.370 
there for about another hour and a half
one<00:02:40.150> of<00:02:40.239> the<00:02:40.330> important<00:02:40.690> reasons<00:02:40.840> that<00:02:41.230> we

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
one of the important reasons that we

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.199 
one of the important reasons that we
made<00:02:41.560> a<00:02:41.860> pie<00:02:42.250> crust<00:02:42.280> that<00:02:42.670> was<00:02:42.790> a<00:02:42.819> little<00:02:43.090> bit

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
made a pie crust that was a little bit

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.300 
made a pie crust that was a little bit
thicker<00:02:43.420> is<00:02:43.810> so<00:02:44.019> that<00:02:44.200> when<00:02:44.410> you<00:02:44.500> do<00:02:44.650> this<00:02:44.860> and

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
thicker is so that when you do this and

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.160 
thicker is so that when you do this and
you<00:02:45.430> take<00:02:45.640> another<00:02:45.880> shell<00:02:46.209> it<00:02:46.599> stands<00:02:46.930> up<00:02:47.049> on

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
you take another shell it stands up on

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.080 
you take another shell it stands up on
its<00:02:47.319> own<00:02:47.440> I've<00:02:47.709> got<00:02:47.890> a<00:02:47.920> few<00:02:48.160> little<00:02:48.190> extra<00:02:48.790> dark
