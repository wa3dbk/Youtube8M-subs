one<00:00:22.050> tray<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:23.869> I'll<00:00:24.869> show<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:25.109> some<00:00:25.439> more

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
one tray and I'll show you some more

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.990 
one tray and I'll show you some more
trays<00:00:25.859> in<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.070> minute<00:00:26.340> but<00:00:26.490> if<00:00:26.609> you're<00:00:26.760> putting

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
trays in a minute but if you're putting

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.920 
trays in a minute but if you're putting
soap<00:00:27.390> in<00:00:27.600> you<00:00:27.750> can<00:00:27.930> just<00:00:29.570> put<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.689> whole<00:00:30.720> thing

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:30.930 
soap in you can just put the whole thing

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.290 
soap in you can just put the whole thing
in<00:00:31.560> right<00:00:31.769> in<00:00:31.920> there<00:00:32.129> like<00:00:32.309> that<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.699> then<00:00:32.820> in

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
in right in there like that and then in

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.270 
in right in there like that and then in
an<00:00:33.449> hour<00:00:33.690> it'll<00:00:34.140> be<00:00:34.320> nice<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.769> warm

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
an hour it'll be nice and warm

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.569 
an hour it'll be nice and warm
I<00:00:35.309> still<00:00:36.030> do<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.719> at<00:00:36.840> 104<00:00:37.590> degrees<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.430> little

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
I still do it at 104 degrees a little

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.569 
I still do it at 104 degrees a little
bit<00:00:38.820> less<00:00:39.000> than<00:00:39.149> 105<00:00:39.719> because<00:00:40.260> anything<00:00:41.190> over

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
bit less than 105 because anything over

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.810 
bit less than 105 because anything over
105<00:00:42.300> Kielty<00:00:42.840> enzymes<00:00:43.290> now<00:00:43.920> some<00:00:44.219> raw<00:00:44.399> foodists

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
105 Kielty enzymes now some raw foodists

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.229 
105 Kielty enzymes now some raw foodists
go<00:00:45.300> all<00:00:45.540> the<00:00:45.629> way<00:00:45.660> up<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:46.129> 115<00:00:47.239> degrees

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
go all the way up to 115 degrees

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.319 
go all the way up to 115 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:00:49.050> but<00:00:49.730> there's<00:00:50.730> some<00:00:50.969> debate<00:00:51.210> about

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
Fahrenheit but there's some debate about

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.150 
Fahrenheit but there's some debate about
that<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:52.050> if<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.230> just<00:00:52.379> keep<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.770> lower<00:00:52.950> than

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
that so if you just keep it lower than

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.340 
that so if you just keep it lower than
105<00:00:53.730> you'll<00:00:54.210> be<00:00:54.390> sure<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.840> getting<00:00:55.110> all<00:00:55.230> of

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
105 you'll be sure and getting all of

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.799 
105 you'll be sure and getting all of
the<00:00:55.469> enzymes<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:56.100> need<00:00:56.309> for<00:00:56.520> your<00:00:56.610> body<00:00:56.879> so

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
the enzymes you need for your body so

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.209 
the enzymes you need for your body so
that's<00:00:57.960> one<00:00:58.230> thing<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.559> can<00:00:58.710> do<00:00:58.829> your<00:00:59.010> with

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
that's one thing you can do your with

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.189 
that's one thing you can do your with
your<00:00:59.340> dehydrator<00:01:00.710> and<00:01:01.710> then<00:01:02.690> you<00:01:03.690> could<00:01:03.930> try

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
your dehydrator and then you could try

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.330 
your dehydrator and then you could try
some<00:01:04.500> bananas<00:01:05.129> or<00:01:05.550> other<00:01:06.000> fruits<00:01:06.649> so<00:01:07.649> I<00:01:07.950> sliced

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
some bananas or other fruits so I sliced

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.760 
some bananas or other fruits so I sliced
my<00:01:08.610> thin<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.299> length<00:01:09.510> plays<00:01:09.780> because<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.500> like

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
my thin and length plays because I like

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.600 
my thin and length plays because I like
they<00:01:11.220> dry<00:01:11.400> faster<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:12.409> also<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:13.770> take<00:01:14.250> them<00:01:14.460> out

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
they dry faster and also I take them out

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.570 
they dry faster and also I take them out
earlier<00:01:15.540> than<00:01:15.869> in<00:01:15.990> 24<00:01:16.470> hours<00:01:16.770> because<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.220> like

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
earlier than in 24 hours because I like

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.450 
earlier than in 24 hours because I like
them<00:01:17.880> chewy<00:01:18.720> but<00:01:19.650> if<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.860> want<00:01:20.040> them<00:01:20.250> crispy

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
them chewy but if you want them crispy

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.210 
them chewy but if you want them crispy
could<00:01:20.970> slice<00:01:21.210> them<00:01:21.450> up<00:01:21.619> in<00:01:22.619> little<00:01:22.680> round

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
could slice them up in little round

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.300 
could slice them up in little round
chunks<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.030> then<00:01:24.509> dehydrate<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:26.070> Furze

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
chunks and then dehydrate the Furze

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.789 
chunks and then dehydrate the Furze
until<00:01:27.030> they<00:01:27.299> are<00:01:27.630> your<00:01:27.780> desired<00:01:28.290> Christmas

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
until they are your desired Christmas

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.859 
until they are your desired Christmas
feel<00:01:29.340> free<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.640> put<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:29.939> little<00:01:30.119> lemon<00:01:30.360> on<00:01:30.570> top

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
feel free to put a little lemon on top

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.530 
feel free to put a little lemon on top
there<00:01:31.700> you<00:01:32.700> could<00:01:32.939> also<00:01:33.119> dehydrate<00:01:33.509> some

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
there you could also dehydrate some

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.060 
there you could also dehydrate some
pumpkin<00:01:36.540> seeds<00:01:36.840> which<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.350> just<00:01:37.560> did<00:01:37.740> from<00:01:37.950> our

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
really nice and crispy you could put

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.840 
really nice and crispy you could put
some<00:01:42.600> sea<00:01:42.780> salt<00:01:43.079> on<00:01:43.320> there<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:44.310> can<00:01:44.490> use<00:01:44.640> these

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
some sea salt on there you can use these

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.460 
some sea salt on there you can use these
for<00:01:45.030> pumpkin<00:01:45.450> seed<00:01:45.689> cheese<00:01:46.079> which<00:01:46.320> is

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
for pumpkin seed cheese which is

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.719 
for pumpkin seed cheese which is
incredible<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:48.229> you<00:01:49.229> could<00:01:49.409> put<00:01:49.590> some<00:01:49.619> oil<00:01:50.430> on

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
incredible and you could put some oil on

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.969 
incredible and you could put some oil on
if<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.030> want<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.360> didn't<00:01:51.659> do<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:51.899> but<00:01:52.799> you
