00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
trick people into thinking that you can

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.969

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
can't this works on both sides so fun to

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.830 
can't this works on both sides so fun to
make<00:02:06.550> another<00:02:06.820> one<00:02:07.000> I<00:02:08.880> could<00:02:09.880> well<00:02:10.239> I<00:02:10.450> just

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840
