however this one is built these things
are<00:00:37.550> they're<00:00:38.550> built<00:00:38.790> on<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.120> RPK<00:00:39.649> receivers

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
are they're built on the RPK receivers

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.420 
are they're built on the RPK receivers
they<00:00:40.920> use<00:00:41.100> different<00:00:41.370> mags<00:00:41.730> than<00:00:42.059> SPD<00:00:42.600> and

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
they use different mags than SPD and

it's<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.550> really<00:00:45.030> good<00:00:45.180> system<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.809> we<00:00:46.020> had

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
it's a really good system and we had

the muzzle boys and girls the mounts and
the<00:01:32.100> optic<00:01:32.880> are<00:01:33.180> together<00:01:35.090> and<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.509> just

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
the optic are together and it just

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.530 
the optic are together and it just
latches<00:01:37.049> on<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:38.030> standard<00:01:39.030> rail<00:01:39.240> that's

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
latches on to the standard rail that's

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.700 
latches on to the standard rail that's
on<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.780> side<00:01:40.049> of<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:41.159> PSL<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:42.710> these

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
on the side of the the PSL and these

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.830 
on the side of the the PSL and these
things<00:01:43.950> have<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.159> great<00:01:44.729> little<00:01:45.000> reticle<00:01:45.570> let's

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
things have a great little reticle let's

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.630 
things have a great little reticle let's
see<00:01:46.020> if<00:01:46.110> we<00:01:46.259> can<00:01:46.439> see<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:49.070> it's<00:01:50.070> got<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.310> range

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
see if we can see that it's got a range

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.520 
see if we can see that it's got a range
finding<00:01:51.240> reticle<00:01:52.070> okay<00:01:53.070> let's<00:01:53.869> do<00:01:54.869> this<00:01:55.140> right

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
finding reticle okay let's do this right

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.550 
finding reticle okay let's do this right
here

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.590 

let's<00:01:59.560> see<00:01:59.860> if<00:01:59.950> we<00:02:00.100> can<00:02:01.680> see<00:02:02.680> that<00:02:03.210> if<00:02:04.210> I<00:02:04.420> can

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
let's see if we can see that if I can

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.760 
let's see if we can see that if I can
show<00:02:04.840> you<00:02:04.900> that<00:02:05.020> radical

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.160 

hmm<00:02:11.770> I<00:02:12.900> don't<00:02:13.900> know<00:02:14.050> if<00:02:14.170> this<00:02:14.350> is<00:02:14.530> showing<00:02:14.800> up

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
hmm I don't know if this is showing up

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.900 
hmm I don't know if this is showing up
because<00:02:17.170> I<00:02:17.320> can't<00:02:17.560> quite<00:02:17.770> see<00:02:18.100> it<00:02:18.130> through<00:02:18.790> the

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
because I can't quite see it through the

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.390 
because I can't quite see it through the
camera<00:02:19.180> but<00:02:19.660> you've<00:02:20.620> got<00:02:20.770> a<00:02:20.800> real<00:02:21.070> simple

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
camera but you've got a real simple

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.100 
camera but you've got a real simple
range-finding<00:02:22.270> reticle<00:02:23.050> that<00:02:23.980> allows<00:02:24.310> you<00:02:25.110> to

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
range-finding reticle that allows you to

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.930 
range-finding reticle that allows you to
pretty<00:02:26.350> much<00:02:26.500> be<00:02:26.740> point<00:02:27.130> of<00:02:27.220> aim<00:02:27.430> point<00:02:27.730> of

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
pretty much be point of aim point of

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.140 
pretty much be point of aim point of
impact<00:02:31.020> at<00:02:32.020> reasonable<00:02:32.560> ranges<00:02:32.950> you've<00:02:33.880> got<00:02:34.120> a

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
impact at reasonable ranges you've got a

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.970 
impact at reasonable ranges you've got a
ballistic<00:02:34.980> compensating<00:02:36.090> turret<00:02:37.260> so<00:02:38.260> I<00:02:38.710> know

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
ballistic compensating turret so I know

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.230 
ballistic compensating turret so I know
you<00:02:39.130> guys<00:02:39.430> out<00:02:40.090> there<00:02:40.210> that<00:02:40.420> are<00:02:40.600> fans<00:02:40.960> of

you guys out there that are fans of

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.220 
you guys out there that are fans of

well<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:45.160> PSL<00:02:45.790> was<00:02:46.090> doing<00:02:46.480> this<00:02:46.950> back<00:02:47.950> in<00:02:48.190> the
