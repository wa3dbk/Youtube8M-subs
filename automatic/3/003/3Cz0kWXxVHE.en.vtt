then I think Jerry wrote an article on
it<00:01:54.640> on<00:01:54.759> his<00:01:54.909> daily<00:01:55.119> decklist<00:01:55.810> type<00:01:56.049> column<00:01:56.890> and

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
it on his daily decklist type column and

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.240 
it on his daily decklist type column and
nobody<00:01:58.270> really<00:01:58.420> heard<00:01:58.960> about<00:01:59.170> it<00:01:59.380> again<00:02:00.009> and

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
nobody really heard about it again and

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.190 
nobody really heard about it again and
then<00:02:00.729> like<00:02:01.090> I<00:02:01.210> would<00:02:01.329> say<00:02:01.479> about<00:02:01.689> three<00:02:01.990> weeks

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200

rhino and solteros seemed awesome in

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.290 
rhino and solteros seemed awesome in
theory<00:02:22.739> so<00:02:23.099> I<00:02:23.129> couldn't<00:02:23.670> wait<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.940> get<00:02:24.030> try<00:02:24.239> it

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
theory so I couldn't wait to get try it

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.020 
theory so I couldn't wait to get try it
out<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.720> as<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:25.379> seemed<00:02:25.620> it<00:02:25.769> is<00:02:26.160> just<00:02:26.819> about<00:02:26.970> as

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
out and as it seemed it is just about as

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.640 
out and as it seemed it is just about as
good<00:02:27.239> as<00:02:27.360> you'd<00:02:27.510> expect<00:02:27.629> so<00:02:27.989> this<00:02:28.140> this<00:02:28.349> open

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
something you still get value out of him

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.180 
something you still get value out of him
because<00:02:55.470> he<00:02:55.560> could<00:02:55.709> use<00:02:55.829> his<00:02:55.980> great

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
because he could use his great

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.030 
because he could use his great
variability<00:02:56.370> ok<00:02:57.200> when<00:02:58.200> you<00:02:58.230> untap<00:02:58.590> with<00:02:58.769> solid

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
variability ok when you untap with solid

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.180 
variability ok when you untap with solid
arrows<00:03:00.440> even<00:03:01.440> if<00:03:01.530> he's<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.739> only<00:03:01.860> creature

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
arrows even if he's the only creature

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.220 
arrows even if he's the only creature
employ<00:03:02.549> you<00:03:03.209> attack<00:03:03.540> with<00:03:03.690> him<00:03:03.840> and<00:03:04.019> then<00:03:04.110> you

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
employ you attack with him and then you

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.900 
employ you attack with him and then you
activate<00:03:04.620> them<00:03:04.709> that's<00:03:04.890> 8<00:03:05.099> damage<00:03:05.579> of<00:03:05.730> life

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
activate them that's 8 damage of life

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.430 
activate them that's 8 damage of life
length<00:03:06.180> so<00:03:06.360> it's<00:03:06.480> like<00:03:06.599> a<00:03:06.629> super<00:03:06.959> baneslayer

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
length so it's like a super baneslayer

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.150 
length so it's like a super baneslayer
angel<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:08.160> if<00:03:08.970> you<00:03:09.480> were<00:03:09.720> losing<00:03:10.290> any<00:03:10.650> damage

it they can't gang block it to kill it

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:20.330 
it they can't gang block it to kill it
