you've just passed your test it might be

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.910 
you've just passed your test it might be

costs for the car well it's about 14,000
pounds<00:02:15.040> and<00:02:15.160> that<00:02:15.250> gives<00:02:15.459> you<00:02:15.610> a<00:02:15.790> low<00:02:16.180> wheels

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
conditioning so it's quite well it could

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.710 
conditioning so it's quite well it could
work<00:02:20.739> really<00:02:21.040> for<00:02:21.190> a<00:02:21.220> car<00:02:21.430> in<00:02:21.580> this<00:02:21.670> class<00:02:21.940> so

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
work really for a car in this class so

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.360 
work really for a car in this class so
performance<00:02:23.590> well<00:02:23.709> I<00:02:23.739> have<00:02:23.920> to<00:02:24.040> say<00:02:24.190> I'm<00:02:24.310> a

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
performance well I have to say I'm a

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.340 
performance well I have to say I'm a
little<00:02:24.400> bit<00:02:24.730> disappointed<00:02:25.030> it<00:02:25.930> does<00:02:26.110> ride

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
little bit disappointed it does ride

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.690 
little bit disappointed it does ride
well<00:02:26.590> on<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:26.800> suspension<00:02:27.160> is<00:02:27.400> firm<00:02:27.670> and

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
well on the suspension is firm and

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.820 
well on the suspension is firm and
sporty<00:02:28.239> but<00:02:28.390> just<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:28.959> steering<00:02:29.410> it's<00:02:29.530> all

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
sporty but just the steering it's all

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.770 
sporty but just the steering it's all
just<00:02:29.980> a<00:02:30.070> little<00:02:30.190> bit<00:02:30.310> on<00:02:30.550> involved<00:02:31.090> and<00:02:31.209> I

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
just a little bit on involved and I

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.449 
just a little bit on involved and I
think<00:02:31.810> for<00:02:32.080> a<00:02:32.170> car<00:02:32.380> with<00:02:32.500> a<00:02:32.560> GTI<00:02:32.890> buggy<00:02:33.190> on<00:02:33.340> the

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
think for a car with a GTI buggy on the

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.310 
think for a car with a GTI buggy on the
back<00:02:33.640> I'll<00:02:34.209> want<00:02:34.510> to<00:02:34.600> feel<00:02:34.750> more<00:02:34.989> in<00:02:35.170> there

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
back I'll want to feel more in there

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.229 
back I'll want to feel more in there
it's<00:02:35.470> not<00:02:35.620> got<00:02:35.800> that<00:02:35.980> go-kart<00:02:36.489> feel<00:02:36.970> on<00:02:37.120> the

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
it's not got that go-kart feel on the

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.360 
it's not got that go-kart feel on the
corners<00:02:37.630> as<00:02:37.750> some<00:02:37.930> of<00:02:38.019> its<00:02:38.080> competitors<00:02:38.709> have

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.380 

fantastic<00:02:43.370> all<00:02:43.549> these<00:02:43.730> measures<00:02:44.090> to<00:02:44.120> make

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
fantastic all these measures to make

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.910 
fantastic all these measures to make
your<00:02:44.540> car<00:02:44.690> go<00:02:44.720> like<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.290> wind<00:02:45.470> and<00:02:45.680> all<00:02:45.769> you

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
your car go like the wind and all you

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.979 
your car go like the wind and all you
end<00:02:46.010> up<00:02:46.159> doing<00:02:46.220> is<00:02:46.580> to<00:02:46.700> sit<00:02:47.000> in<00:02:47.239> traffic<00:02:47.390> at

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
end up doing is to sit in traffic at

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:53.320 
end up doing is to sit in traffic at
least<00:02:48.170> I've<00:02:48.260> got<00:02:48.290> CD<00:02:48.769> player<00:02:51.730> so<00:02:52.730> maybe<00:02:53.120> it's

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
least I've got CD player so maybe it's

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.030 
least I've got CD player so maybe it's
just<00:02:53.450> me<00:02:53.690> but<00:02:53.900> I<00:02:53.959> would<00:02:54.200> remember<00:02:54.590> my<00:02:54.769> hot

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
just me but I would remember my hot

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.710 
just me but I would remember my hot
hatches<00:02:55.250> are<00:02:55.519> just<00:02:55.730> a<00:02:55.909> bit<00:02:56.030> more<00:02:56.209> exciting

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
hatches are just a bit more exciting

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.569 
hatches are just a bit more exciting
than<00:02:56.870> this<00:02:56.989> but<00:02:57.530> perhaps<00:02:57.709> it's<00:02:58.010> a<00:02:58.069> case<00:02:58.250> of<00:02:58.280> the

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
than this but perhaps it's a case of the

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:00.850 
than this but perhaps it's a case of the
older<00:02:58.760> I<00:02:58.790> get<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.269> better<00:02:59.510> I<00:02:59.629> was<00:02:59.870> but<00:03:00.560> even<00:03:00.590> if

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
older I get the better I was but even if

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.110 
older I get the better I was but even if
it<00:03:00.950> hasn't<00:03:01.099> set<00:03:01.430> me<00:03:01.549> on<00:03:01.579> fire<00:03:01.670> with<00:03:02.030> the

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
it hasn't set me on fire with the

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.030 
it hasn't set me on fire with the
performance<00:03:02.659> I<00:03:02.900> still<00:03:03.379> think<00:03:03.590> it's<00:03:03.680> the<00:03:03.799> best

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
performance I still think it's the best

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.740
