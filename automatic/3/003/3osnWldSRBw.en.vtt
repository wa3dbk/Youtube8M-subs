00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:06.069 
something it is a seven millimeter

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:11.290 
something it is a seven millimeter
that's<00:02:06.939> what<00:02:07.149> I<00:02:07.179> used<00:02:08.400> so

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
that's what I used so

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.540 
that's what I used so
basically<00:02:12.200> sometimes<00:02:12.470> your<00:02:13.010> resistor<00:02:13.430> will

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
basically sometimes your resistor will

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.430 
basically sometimes your resistor will
just<00:02:13.730> go<00:02:13.850> bad<00:02:14.060> and<00:02:14.300> that<00:02:14.480> too<00:02:14.600> this<00:02:14.720> here<00:02:14.990> you

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
just go bad and that too this here you

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.490 
just go bad and that too this here you
pop<00:02:15.590> this<00:02:15.800> prong<00:02:16.070> this<00:02:16.520> off<00:02:16.730> and<00:02:17.060> I<00:02:17.720> just<00:02:18.350> pull

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
pop this prong this off and I just pull

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.620 
pop this prong this off and I just pull
these<00:02:18.620> two<00:02:18.890> little<00:02:19.790> seven<00:02:20.030> millimeter<00:02:20.330> screws

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:49.960 
wire because it has an external ground
and<00:03:48.620> you<00:03:48.680> wonder<00:03:48.980> why<00:03:49.160> they<00:03:49.459> would<00:03:49.489> paint<00:03:49.820> the

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
and you wonder why they would paint the

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.449 
and you wonder why they would paint the
whole<00:03:50.090> thing<00:03:50.150> I<00:03:50.630> actually<00:03:51.110> moved<00:03:51.560> my<00:03:51.769> ground

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
whole thing I actually moved my ground

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.490 
whole thing I actually moved my ground
wire<00:03:52.670> from<00:03:52.970> way<00:03:53.120> down<00:03:53.300> there<00:03:53.570> to<00:03:53.989> right<00:03:54.200> here

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
wire from way down there to right here

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.220 
wire from way down there to right here
and<00:03:54.680> that<00:03:55.280> is<00:03:55.489> for<00:03:56.180> me<00:03:56.450> because<00:03:56.810> this<00:03:56.930> is<00:03:57.080> my

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
and that is for me because this is my

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.920 
and that is for me because this is my
vehicle<00:03:57.760> so<00:03:58.760> it's<00:03:58.910> easier<00:03:59.209> next<00:03:59.360> time<00:03:59.540> if<00:03:59.810> I

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
vehicle so it's easier next time if I

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:00.820 
vehicle so it's easier next time if I
ever<00:04:00.019> have<00:04:00.170> to<00:04:00.290> get<00:04:00.410> back<00:04:00.560> in<00:04:00.680> here<00:04:00.769> again

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
ever have to get back in here again

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.430 
ever have to get back in here again
which<00:04:01.220> I<00:04:01.370> probably<00:04:01.640> won't<00:04:02.000> have<00:04:02.180> to<00:04:02.440> unless

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
which I probably won't have to unless

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.810 
which I probably won't have to unless
something<00:04:03.769> goes<00:04:03.860> wrong<00:04:04.070> with<00:04:04.250> this<00:04:04.400> Chinese

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
something goes wrong with this Chinese

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.550 
something goes wrong with this Chinese
made<00:04:05.000> part<00:04:06.130> but<00:04:07.130> they<00:04:07.400> paint<00:04:07.700> it<00:04:07.850> and<00:04:08.380> if<00:04:09.380> you

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
made part but they paint it and if you

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.870 
made part but they paint it and if you
ever<00:04:09.739> really<00:04:10.100> messed<00:04:10.549> around<00:04:10.670> with

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
ever really messed around with

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.090 
ever really messed around with
electrical<00:04:11.480> stuff<00:04:11.750> stuff<00:04:12.590> that's<00:04:12.769> painted

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
electrical stuff stuff that's painted

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.680 
electrical stuff stuff that's painted
doesn't<00:04:13.400> really<00:04:13.519> make<00:04:13.670> a<00:04:13.700> good<00:04:13.910> ground<00:04:14.180> so<00:04:14.630> I

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
doesn't really make a good ground so I

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.900 
doesn't really make a good ground so I
took<00:04:14.750> my<00:04:15.049> knife<00:04:15.230> and<00:04:15.470> I<00:04:15.920> scraped<00:04:16.459> off<00:04:16.609> all<00:04:16.820> the

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
took my knife and I scraped off all the

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.990 
took my knife and I scraped off all the
paint<00:04:17.090> right<00:04:17.239> here<00:04:17.269> and<00:04:17.540> I<00:04:18.609> didn't<00:04:19.609> put<00:04:19.880> the

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
paint right here and I didn't put the

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.340 
paint right here and I didn't put the
bolt<00:04:20.180> back<00:04:20.270> in<00:04:20.600> on<00:04:20.750> the<00:04:20.870> bottom<00:04:21.169> either

bolt back in on the bottom either

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:22.810

00:04:52.119 --> 00:04:52.129 
back in and I know this is an easy job

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:53.860 
back in and I know this is an easy job
and<00:04:52.159> you<00:04:52.550> know<00:04:52.729> some<00:04:53.449> people<00:04:53.479> are<00:04:53.689> going<00:04:53.810> to

00:04:57.459 --> 00:04:57.469 
blower motor in but I figured out it's

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:59.679 
blower motor in but I figured out it's
just<00:04:57.560> a<00:04:57.860> another<00:04:58.669> little<00:04:59.029> job<00:04:59.360> that<00:04:59.539> I<00:04:59.599> was

00:04:59.679 --> 00:04:59.689 
just a another little job that I was

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:01.240 
just a another little job that I was
doing<00:04:59.990> on<00:05:00.050> the<00:05:00.110> side<00:05:00.319> and<00:05:00.500> I<00:05:00.620> had<00:05:00.740> to<00:05:00.800> upload<00:05:01.009> it

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
doing on the side and I had to upload it

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.320 
doing on the side and I had to upload it
because<00:05:01.340> you<00:05:01.520> know<00:05:01.639> there<00:05:01.759> are<00:05:01.849> some<00:05:02.060> people
