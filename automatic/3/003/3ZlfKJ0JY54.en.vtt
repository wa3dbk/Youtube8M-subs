step into a tournament like a week later
so<00:03:21.920> I'm<00:03:22.920> stand<00:03:23.430> before<00:03:23.579> you<00:03:23.760> saying<00:03:24.000> that's

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
so I'm stand before you saying that's

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.120 
so I'm stand before you saying that's
too<00:03:24.390> much<00:03:24.569> it<00:03:24.900> has<00:03:25.079> affected<00:03:25.260> my<00:03:25.620> play<00:03:25.859> and

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
too much it has affected my play and

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.160 
too much it has affected my play and
that's<00:03:26.670> why<00:03:26.850> in<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.180> future<00:03:27.510> changes<00:03:27.989> will<00:03:28.140> be

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
that's why in the future changes will be

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.860 
that's why in the future changes will be
made<00:03:28.260> and<00:03:28.650> I'll<00:03:29.040> be<00:03:29.190> much<00:03:30.030> more<00:03:30.269> resilient<00:03:30.660> to

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
made and I'll be much more resilient to

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:31.940 
made and I'll be much more resilient to
things<00:03:31.109> like<00:03:31.260> that<00:03:31.410> I'll<00:03:31.500> be<00:03:31.590> able<00:03:31.620> to<00:03:31.799> take<00:03:31.920> a

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
things like that I'll be able to take a

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.770 
things like that I'll be able to take a
trip<00:03:32.160> like<00:03:32.220> that<00:03:32.340> but<00:03:33.150> I'll<00:03:33.239> be<00:03:33.329> buffered<00:03:33.630> by

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
trip like that but I'll be buffered by

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:34.970 
trip like that but I'll be buffered by
hours<00:03:34.139> and<00:03:34.170> hours<00:03:34.319> of<00:03:34.500> training<00:03:34.680> on<00:03:34.889> either

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
hours and hours of training on either

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.830 
hours and hours of training on either
end<00:03:35.220> so<00:03:35.519> I<00:03:35.760> hope<00:03:36.150> to<00:03:36.299> be<00:03:36.329> a<00:03:36.420> better<00:03:36.540> player<00:03:36.750> in

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
end so I hope to be a better player in

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.530
