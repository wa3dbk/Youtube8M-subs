00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
was a couple of flashbacks but it was

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.090 
was a couple of flashbacks but it was
really<00:01:48.450> really<00:01:48.750> short<00:01:48.930> stuff<00:01:49.259> so<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:49.649> didn't

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
really really short stuff so I didn't

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.139 
really really short stuff so I didn't
get<00:01:50.159> bothered<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.670> there<00:01:50.790> was<00:01:50.880> some<00:01:51.030> great

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
get bothered and there was some great

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.569 
get bothered and there was some great
stuff<00:01:51.270> as<00:01:51.600> well<00:01:51.810> when<00:01:52.259> Zorro<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.710> Sons<00:01:53.369> he

stuff as well when Zorro and Sons he

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.700 
stuff as well when Zorro and Sons he
were<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:54.540> guess<00:01:54.840> about<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.229> do<00:01:55.350> some<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.619> their

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
were I guess about to do some of their

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.499 
were I guess about to do some of their
moves<00:01:55.799> we<00:01:56.219> see<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.399> couple<00:01:56.579> flashbacks<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.329> what

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
moves we see a couple flashbacks of what

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.240 
moves we see a couple flashbacks of what
they<00:01:57.630> did<00:01:57.689> in<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.020> two<00:01:58.200> years<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.740> we<00:01:59.070> also

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
they did in the two years and we also

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.130 
they did in the two years and we also
see<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.670> flashback<00:02:00.149> where<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.450> pacifist<00:02:00.930> ax

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
see the flashback where the pacifist ax

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.760 
see the flashback where the pacifist ax
or<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.409> believe<00:02:01.979> it's<00:02:02.100> cool<00:02:02.790> excuse<00:02:03.299> me

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
or I believe it's cool excuse me

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.010 
or I believe it's cool excuse me
makes<00:02:04.770> them<00:02:04.950> disappear<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.549> whatnot<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.030> it

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
makes them disappear and whatnot and it

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.690 
makes them disappear and whatnot and it
kind<00:02:07.320> of<00:02:07.380> really<00:02:07.619> got<00:02:07.770> me<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.069> little<00:02:08.280> bit<00:02:08.489> like

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
kind of really got me a little bit like

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.219 
kind of really got me a little bit like
hype<00:02:09.090> at<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.360> same<00:02:09.509> time<00:02:09.690> because<00:02:09.899> those<00:02:10.020> were

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
hype at the same time because those were

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.380 
hype at the same time because those were
great<00:02:10.440> moments<00:02:10.739> so<00:02:11.400> some<00:02:11.790> people<00:02:12.060> might<00:02:12.239> be

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
great moments so some people might be

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.850 
great moments so some people might be
turned<00:02:12.870> off<00:02:13.050> by<00:02:13.200> that<00:02:13.230> and<00:02:13.500> I<00:02:13.530> could

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
turned off by that and I could

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.320 
turned off by that and I could
you<00:02:13.980> understand<00:02:14.340> some<00:02:14.550> people<00:02:14.820> just<00:02:14.970> don't

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
you understand some people just don't

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.720 
you understand some people just don't
want<00:02:15.660> flashbacks<00:02:16.320> but<00:02:16.740> for<00:02:16.920> me<00:02:17.040> it<00:02:17.280> added<00:02:17.610> on

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
want flashbacks but for me it added on

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.000 
want flashbacks but for me it added on
to<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.120> I<00:02:18.360> guess<00:02:18.840> awesomeness<00:02:19.500> of<00:02:19.590> everything

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
to the I guess awesomeness of everything

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.500 
to the I guess awesomeness of everything
that<00:02:20.100> was<00:02:20.220> going<00:02:20.370> on<00:02:20.550> so<00:02:20.820> I<00:02:20.850> was<00:02:21.060> real<00:02:21.300> hyped

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
that was going on so I was real hyped

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.080 
that was going on so I was real hyped
for<00:02:21.660> it<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:21.990> nonetheless<00:02:22.890> is<00:02:23.400> just<00:02:23.580> action

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
for it and nonetheless is just action

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.450 
for it and nonetheless is just action
first<00:02:24.360> of<00:02:24.510> all<00:02:24.630> I<00:02:24.810> believe<00:02:24.870> Hans<00:02:25.530> uses<00:02:25.950> an<00:02:26.100> epic

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
first of all I believe Hans uses an epic

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.090 
first of all I believe Hans uses an epic
move<00:02:26.640> it's<00:02:27.150> a<00:02:27.480> replica<00:02:27.990> of<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.590> moon<00:02:28.800> walked

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
move it's a replica of the moon walked

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.430 
move it's a replica of the moon walked
at<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.400> CP<00:02:29.730> 9news<00:02:30.270> and<00:02:30.510> he<00:02:30.600> learned<00:02:31.230> there

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
at the CP 9news and he learned there

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.200 
at the CP 9news and he learned there
from<00:02:31.620> when<00:02:31.770> he<00:02:31.890> was<00:02:31.920> on<00:02:32.160> new<00:02:32.340> kama<00:02:32.610> island<00:02:33.120> I

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
from when he was on new kama island I

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.020 
from when he was on new kama island I
was<00:02:33.240> like<00:02:33.830> this<00:02:34.830> is<00:02:35.040> what<00:02:35.220> we<00:02:35.340> wanted<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:35.820> see

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
was like this is what we wanted to see

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.910 
was like this is what we wanted to see
this<00:02:36.240> is<00:02:36.360> why<00:02:36.480> I<00:02:36.510> wanted<00:02:36.960> to<00:02:37.020> see<00:02:37.260> and<00:02:37.440> I

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
this is why I wanted to see and I

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.680 
this is why I wanted to see and I
believe<00:02:38.250> this<00:02:38.490> is<00:02:38.760> actually<00:02:39.240> the<00:02:39.300> concert

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
believe this is actually the concert

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.060 
believe this is actually the concert
where<00:02:39.840> I<00:02:39.870> started<00:02:40.140> reviewing<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.560> manga<00:02:40.980> I

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
where I started reviewing the manga I

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.340 
where I started reviewing the manga I
might<00:02:41.310> be<00:02:41.459> wrong<00:02:41.730> but<00:02:42.090> I<00:02:42.330> believe<00:02:42.540> I<00:02:42.959> started

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
might be wrong but I believe I started

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.140 
might be wrong but I believe I started
reviewing<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.770> around<00:02:43.980> here<00:02:44.130> because<00:02:44.340> Zorro

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
reviewing it around here because Zorro

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.810 
reviewing it around here because Zorro
uses<00:02:45.540> his<00:02:45.720> 108<00:02:46.320> pound<00:02:46.680> what<00:02:47.459> is<00:02:47.550> it<00:02:47.670> called

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
uses his 108 pound what is it called

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.640 
uses his 108 pound what is it called
again<00:02:47.940> I<00:02:48.090> wrote<00:02:48.480> down<00:02:48.630> my<00:02:48.750> head<00:02:48.870> 108<00:02:49.440> pounds

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
again I wrote down my head 108 pounds

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.500 
again I wrote down my head 108 pounds
Phoenix<00:02:50.310> and<00:02:50.520> I<00:02:50.880> believe<00:02:51.120> that's<00:02:51.330> where<00:02:51.450> I

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.880 
Phoenix and I believe that's where I
started<00:02:51.780> reviewing<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.170> manga<00:02:52.500> so<00:02:52.709> I'm

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890
