00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.080
 That's why we go faster

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.420
 I was at d'amico and olive oil 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.029
 First, it's up to the tomatoes 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.510
 you remove the upper part of the is 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.949
 namely on you so so the tomatoes 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.500
 can be filled because I have that now 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.840

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.160
 get a nice ride 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.200
 I also bring out the liquid with 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.570
 we do not need the avocado 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.890
 I shame now that I start here 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.570

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.700

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.570
 that means I will be very gentle now 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.360
 Proceed and here just so small 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:57.090

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.379

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.059

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.960
 I think it's just crazy 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.430
 Sensual I do not say so now 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.560
 Anyone can think if how glorious 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.110

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.710

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.680
 By the way, you want more longer ones 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.990

 you go to the bacon in the back with it 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.130
 Maybe you already guessed that 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.719

 at sami curves oil and mustard is calm 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:08.119
 really good for having a nice one 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:15.209

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:19.800

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.739

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.160
 We must always check 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.739
 our food tastes otherwise you can yes 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.670
 do not propose anyone 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.470
 I will not do that in the case anyway 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.540
 do it because everything tips quickly from me 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.690
 sat up himself 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:39.540
 just tastes divine, last but not least 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:42.140
 we fill the avocado bacon dice the 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.140
 tomatoes 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.040
 people that was so easy and it looks like that 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.380
 good looks so cool on this 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.780
 at sami kohl even oil dressing was that 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.860
 the meat look really juicy 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.860
 I really want to bite now 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:06.840
 the best salad I have ever had 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:10.230
 creamy almost crisp through the 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.690
 Bacon cube will be slightly sweetish 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.070
 somehow through the bazaar mikko while 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.600
 i made the first recipe i did 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.030
 ever the second prepared the 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:22.320
 snack number two is tomato mozzarella 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:25.950
 bread for that you need bread tomatoes 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:28.320
 mozzarella and an essential ingredient in 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.610
 I prepared the kitchen garlic 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.170
 the recipe in which I already have the boat 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.000
 have slightly touched which can in the 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.560
 make toaster or in the oven and then 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.500
 Do I think that like jamie oliver 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.570
 and really elegance on it 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.970
 pressed then the shell dissolves like 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.830
 I even rhyme about it once 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.280
 whole bread 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:49.650
 the garlic sticks well 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.910
 just literally tomatoes I remove 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.840

 rows that spread over our studio 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.560
 everything depending on the garlic smells once 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.470
 here on it now I also cut the 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.690
 mozzarella in thin slices is thin 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.580
 Here is always relatively professional 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.640
 laugh now but already like it 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:11.570

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.570

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.280

 one bowl at a time with it 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:27.230
