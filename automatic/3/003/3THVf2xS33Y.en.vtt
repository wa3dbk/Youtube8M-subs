00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
some stuff here called a vapor rust I've

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.600 
some stuff here called a vapor rust I've
been<00:00:13.380> playing<00:00:13.590> with<00:00:13.620> this<00:00:13.830> stuff<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.070> has

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
been playing with this stuff and has

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.890 
been playing with this stuff and has
really<00:00:15.059> good<00:00:15.330> luck<00:00:15.540> with<00:00:15.719> it

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
really good luck with it

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.580 
really good luck with it
it's<00:00:16.109> water-based<00:00:16.800> non-toxic<00:00:18.410> doesn't<00:00:19.410> seem

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
it's water-based non-toxic doesn't seem

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.450 
it's water-based non-toxic doesn't seem
to<00:00:19.830> affect<00:00:20.340> anything<00:00:21.060> like<00:00:21.210> plastics<00:00:21.900> or

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
to affect anything like plastics or

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.340 
to affect anything like plastics or
different<00:00:23.460> metals<00:00:23.910> it<00:00:24.720> just<00:00:24.960> kind<00:00:25.140> of<00:00:25.170> like

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
different metals it just kind of like

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.890 
different metals it just kind of like
dissolves<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:26.130> rust<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.699> then<00:00:27.390> that's<00:00:27.599> it

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
dissolves the rust and then that's it

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.109 
dissolves the rust and then that's it
and<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.920> doesn't<00:00:29.519> seem<00:00:29.609> if<00:00:29.789> you<00:00:29.880> leave<00:00:30.029> the

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
and it doesn't seem if you leave the

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.810 
and it doesn't seem if you leave the
parts<00:00:30.420> in<00:00:30.660> there<00:00:30.990> longer<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:32.160> doesn't<00:00:32.550> seem<00:00:32.669> to

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
parts in there longer it doesn't seem to

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.360 
parts in there longer it doesn't seem to
affect<00:00:32.850> them<00:00:33.420> adversely<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:35.100> can<00:00:35.250> reuse

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
affect them adversely and you can reuse

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.889 
affect them adversely and you can reuse
the<00:00:35.670> stuff<00:00:35.910> over<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.329> over<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.600> over<00:00:36.690> again

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
the stuff over and over and over again

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.200 
the stuff over and over and over again
I've<00:00:37.410> already<00:00:37.710> used<00:00:37.739> this<00:00:38.040> stuff<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.940> bunch<00:00:39.059> of

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
I've already used this stuff a bunch of

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.630 
I've already used this stuff a bunch of
times<00:00:39.450> here<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.050> it's<00:00:40.410> still<00:00:40.620> working<00:00:40.860> so

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
times here and it's still working so

there's also some like bottle case
screws<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.270> don't<00:01:12.420> have<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.600> whole<00:01:12.840> lot<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:13.110> hope

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
screws I don't have a whole lot of hope

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.370 
screws I don't have a whole lot of hope
for<00:01:13.260> these<00:01:13.560> because<00:01:13.890> these<00:01:14.130> are<00:01:14.189> pretty<00:01:15.090> well

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
for these because these are pretty well

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.719 
for these because these are pretty well
pitted<00:01:16.380> but<00:01:16.680> I'll<00:01:17.159> go<00:01:17.310> ahead<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.520> give<00:01:17.610> them<00:01:17.700> a

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
pitted but I'll go ahead and give them a

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
shot can't hurt here's some hub parts in

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.560 
shot can't hurt here's some hub parts in
here<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.610> I'm<00:01:23.880> just<00:01:24.000> going<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.180> dump<00:01:24.330> all<00:01:24.450> this

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
here so I'm just going to dump all this

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.460 
here so I'm just going to dump all this
stuff<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:24.990> here

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
stuff in here

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.370 
stuff in here
and<00:01:26.070> we'll<00:01:26.700> see<00:01:27.049> how<00:01:28.049> well<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.530> does<00:01:30.290> okay<00:01:31.290> I've

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
and we'll see how well it does okay I've

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.710 
and we'll see how well it does okay I've
had<00:01:31.560> these<00:01:31.710> parts<00:01:32.040> soaking<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:32.549> in<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:33.060> vapor

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
had these parts soaking in in the vapor

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.710 
had these parts soaking in in the vapor
rust<00:01:34.049> for<00:01:34.380> probably<00:01:34.770> about<00:01:34.890> 15<00:01:35.130> hours<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:35.939> go

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
rust for probably about 15 hours and go

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.310 
rust for probably about 15 hours and go
ahead<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.200> pull<00:01:37.470> these<00:01:37.619> out<00:01:37.860> here<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:39.320> rinse

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
ahead and pull these out here and rinse

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.420 
ahead and pull these out here and rinse
them<00:01:40.470> off<00:01:40.650> in<00:01:40.950> just<00:01:41.220> some<00:01:41.400> fresh<00:01:41.939> water<00:01:45.409> and

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
them off in just some fresh water and

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.230 
them off in just some fresh water and
that's<00:01:47.430> looking<00:01:48.240> pretty<00:01:48.299> good<00:01:50.240> because

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
that's looking pretty good because

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.760 
that's looking pretty good because
there's<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.570> bit<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:51.840> rust<00:01:52.020> down<00:01:52.259> on<00:01:52.439> this<00:01:52.530> part

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
there's a bit of rust down on this part

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.420 
there's a bit of rust down on this part
here<00:01:53.310> that's<00:01:54.000> all<00:01:54.210> kind<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.450> gone<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:58.430> here's

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
here that's all kind of gone and here's

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.359 
here that's all kind of gone and here's
the<00:01:59.640> cassette<00:01:59.790> that<00:02:00.500> was<00:02:01.500> like<00:02:01.649> really<00:02:02.009> rusty

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
the cassette that was like really rusty

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.090 
the cassette that was like really rusty
looking<00:02:02.670> before<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:03.960> all<00:02:04.170> that's<00:02:04.380> that's

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
looking before and so all that's that's

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.140 
looking before and so all that's that's
gone<00:02:05.399> that's<00:02:05.610> looking<00:02:05.939> pretty<00:02:06.119> nice<00:02:06.270> there

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.150 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.670 

and<00:02:11.150> I'll<00:02:11.630> probably<00:02:11.780> take<00:02:11.990> like<00:02:12.140> a<00:02:12.200> scrub

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
and I'll probably take like a scrub

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.130 
and I'll probably take like a scrub
brush<00:02:12.710> and<00:02:13.220> like<00:02:13.820> some<00:02:14.120> dish<00:02:14.330> soap<00:02:14.360> and<00:02:14.870> just

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
brush and like some dish soap and just

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.380 
brush and like some dish soap and just
scrub<00:02:15.350> over<00:02:15.590> these<00:02:15.790> parts<00:02:16.790> and<00:02:17.060> just<00:02:17.210> clean

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
scrub over these parts and just clean

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.360 
scrub over these parts and just clean
them<00:02:17.540> off<00:02:17.660> a<00:02:17.690> little<00:02:17.930> bit<00:02:18.020> better<00:02:18.200> after<00:02:18.650> and

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
them off a little bit better after and

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.570 
them off a little bit better after and
then<00:02:19.490> let<00:02:19.610> them<00:02:19.700> dry

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
then let them dry

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.830 
then let them dry
okay<00:02:22.580> so<00:02:22.640> here's<00:02:22.940> all<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.210> parts<00:02:23.480> out<00:02:23.630> of<00:02:23.690> the

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
okay so here's all the parts out of the

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.230 
okay so here's all the parts out of the
vapor<00:02:24.110> rose<00:02:24.260> been<00:02:24.560> rinsed<00:02:24.860> off<00:02:25.040> and<00:02:25.370> what<00:02:26.150> do

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
vapor rose been rinsed off and what do

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.460 
vapor rose been rinsed off and what do
you<00:02:26.270> think<00:02:26.510> I<00:02:26.600> think<00:02:26.660> they<00:02:26.900> look<00:02:27.080> great<00:02:27.200> look

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
you think I think they look great look

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.810 
you think I think they look great look
at<00:02:27.620> this<00:02:27.800> so<00:02:27.920> I<00:02:27.950> could<00:02:28.070> set<00:02:28.370> this<00:02:28.520> thing<00:02:28.670> was

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
at this so I could set this thing was

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.910 
at this so I could set this thing was
like<00:02:28.970> covered<00:02:29.390> with<00:02:29.540> rust<00:02:29.750> and<00:02:30.020> I<00:02:30.560> think<00:02:30.770> looks

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
like covered with rust and I think looks

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.140 
like covered with rust and I think looks
way<00:02:31.220> better

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
way better

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.990 
way better
I<00:02:32.180> would<00:02:32.780> definitely<00:02:32.930> reuse<00:02:33.440> that<00:02:33.680> now<00:02:34.000> the

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
I would definitely reuse that now the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.750 
I would definitely reuse that now the
bracket<00:02:35.690> here<00:02:35.870> on<00:02:36.080> this<00:02:36.200> reflector<00:02:36.860> that<00:02:37.340> was

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
bracket here on this reflector that was

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.310 
bracket here on this reflector that was
covered<00:02:38.090> with<00:02:38.120> rust<00:02:38.480> and<00:02:38.810> that<00:02:38.959> looks<00:02:39.140> really

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
covered with rust and that looks really

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.620 
covered with rust and that looks really
good<00:02:39.560> right<00:02:40.459> now<00:02:40.640> and<00:02:40.910> I<00:02:41.180> think<00:02:41.239> this<00:02:41.480> stuff

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
good right now and I think this stuff

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:42.880 
good right now and I think this stuff
also<00:02:41.930> sort<00:02:42.140> of<00:02:42.200> works<00:02:42.350> as<00:02:42.500> a<00:02:42.530> rust<00:02:42.800> inhibitor

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
also sort of works as a rust inhibitor

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.580 
also sort of works as a rust inhibitor
so<00:02:43.459> it<00:02:43.610> keeps<00:02:43.880> it<00:02:44.120> from<00:02:44.330> re<00:02:45.050> rusting<00:02:45.440> right

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
so it keeps it from re rusting right

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.160 
so it keeps it from re rusting right
away<00:02:45.830> unlike<00:02:46.520> some<00:02:46.760> other<00:02:46.940> things<00:02:47.450> used<00:02:47.900> to

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
away unlike some other things used to

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.090 
away unlike some other things used to
clean<00:02:49.130> rust<00:02:49.370> off<00:02:49.550> and<00:02:49.880> it<00:02:50.209> doesn't<00:02:50.480> seem<00:02:50.630> to

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
clean rust off and it doesn't seem to

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.830 
clean rust off and it doesn't seem to
damage<00:02:52.100> any<00:02:52.400> of<00:02:52.430> plastics<00:02:53.090> or<00:02:53.239> aluminum<00:02:53.570> parts

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
damage any of plastics or aluminum parts

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.140 
damage any of plastics or aluminum parts
at<00:02:53.959> all<00:02:54.080> I<00:02:54.350> still<00:02:55.130> want<00:02:55.310> to<00:02:55.340> go<00:02:55.520> through<00:02:55.730> and<00:02:55.940> re

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
at all I still want to go through and re

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.030 
at all I still want to go through and re
lube<00:02:56.330> all<00:02:56.600> the<00:02:56.750> pivot<00:02:57.020> points<00:02:57.440> on<00:02:57.590> the

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
lube all the pivot points on the

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.390 
lube all the pivot points on the
derailers<00:02:58.640> remove<00:02:59.090> the<00:02:59.239> pulleys<00:02:59.600> here<00:03:00.200> I<00:03:00.400> want

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
derailers remove the pulleys here I want

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.660 
derailers remove the pulleys here I want
to<00:03:01.459> flush<00:03:02.390> out<00:03:02.630> and<00:03:02.989> reloop<00:03:03.709> this<00:03:03.950> free<00:03:04.220> hub<00:03:04.459> on

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
to flush out and reloop this free hub on

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.060 
to flush out and reloop this free hub on
the<00:03:04.700> inside<00:03:05.150> so<00:03:05.690> that<00:03:05.720> you<00:03:06.080> know<00:03:06.140> good

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
the inside so that you know good

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.040 
the inside so that you know good
lubrication<00:03:07.459> on<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:08.030> pulleys<00:03:08.300> there<00:03:08.540> or<00:03:08.750> on

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
lubrication on the pulleys there or on

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.229 
lubrication on the pulleys there or on
the<00:03:09.140> bearings<00:03:09.470> and<00:03:09.940> there's<00:03:10.940> a<00:03:11.000> few<00:03:11.120> little

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
the bearings and there's a few little

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:12.789 
the bearings and there's a few little
parts<00:03:11.510> here<00:03:11.720> like<00:03:11.870> this<00:03:12.020> screw<00:03:12.620> right<00:03:12.739> here

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
parts here like this screw right here

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.340 
parts here like this screw right here
there's<00:03:13.250> so<00:03:13.370> little<00:03:13.400> rust<00:03:13.760> on<00:03:13.880> here<00:03:14.299> so<00:03:14.510> it<00:03:14.900> may

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
there's so little rust on here so it may

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:16.870 
there's so little rust on here so it may
have<00:03:15.470> been<00:03:15.560> covered<00:03:16.040> up<00:03:16.190> while<00:03:16.430> I<00:03:16.459> was<00:03:16.549> in

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
have been covered up while I was in

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.870 
have been covered up while I was in
there<00:03:17.090> so<00:03:17.980> I'll<00:03:18.980> probably<00:03:19.100> pull<00:03:19.400> that<00:03:19.430> out<00:03:19.670> and

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
there so I'll probably pull that out and

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.120 
there so I'll probably pull that out and
put<00:03:20.660> that<00:03:20.690> back<00:03:20.989> in<00:03:21.200> the<00:03:21.290> vapor<00:03:21.500> rust<00:03:21.799> there

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
put that back in the vapor rust there

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.550 
put that back in the vapor rust there
it's<00:03:23.030> not<00:03:23.209> going<00:03:23.390> to<00:03:23.450> repair<00:03:23.690> any<00:03:23.870> damage<00:03:24.410> the

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
it's not going to repair any damage the

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.680 
it's not going to repair any damage the
parts<00:03:24.890> caused<00:03:25.400> by<00:03:25.610> the<00:03:25.670> rust<00:03:25.910> like<00:03:26.150> these

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
parts caused by the rust like these

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.090 
parts caused by the rust like these
screws<00:03:27.110> here<00:03:27.410> there's<00:03:27.590> a<00:03:27.650> lot<00:03:27.830> of<00:03:27.950> little

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
screws here there's a lot of little

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.039 
screws here there's a lot of little
pitting<00:03:28.489> here<00:03:28.880> it<00:03:29.030> needs<00:03:29.330> a<00:03:29.690> little<00:03:29.780> bit<00:03:29.930> of

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
pitting here it needs a little bit of

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:31.479 
pitting here it needs a little bit of
rust<00:03:30.200> on<00:03:30.320> those<00:03:30.590> because<00:03:31.070> these<00:03:31.220> were<00:03:31.310> pretty

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
rust on those because these were pretty

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.840 
rust on those because these were pretty
bad<00:03:32.530> but<00:03:33.530> it's<00:03:34.100> not<00:03:34.220> gonna<00:03:34.310> repair<00:03:34.580> the

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
bad but it's not gonna repair the

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.000 
bad but it's not gonna repair the
pitting<00:03:35.269> so<00:03:35.480> these<00:03:35.870> two<00:03:36.080> look<00:03:36.380> ugly<00:03:36.860> so<00:03:36.950> I

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
pitting so these two look ugly so I

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.319 
pitting so these two look ugly so I
probably<00:03:37.160> replace<00:03:37.549> those<00:03:37.790> little<00:03:38.120> screws

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
probably replace those little screws

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:41.110 
probably replace those little screws
there<00:03:38.930> and<00:03:39.650> like<00:03:40.040> on<00:03:40.160> these<00:03:40.310> parts<00:03:40.640> here

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
there and like on these parts here

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.479 
there and like on these parts here
there's<00:03:41.630> still<00:03:41.810> Chrome<00:03:42.079> missing<00:03:42.799> where<00:03:43.010> the

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
there's still Chrome missing where the

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:44.979 
there's still Chrome missing where the
rust<00:03:43.670> had<00:03:43.820> been<00:03:44.120> so<00:03:44.329> it's<00:03:44.450> not<00:03:44.570> to<00:03:44.690> replace<00:03:44.750> the

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
rust had been so it's not to replace the

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.620 
rust had been so it's not to replace the
chrome<00:03:45.410> but<00:03:46.100> the<00:03:46.220> rust<00:03:46.430> has<00:03:46.549> gone<00:03:46.790> on<00:03:47.000> those<00:03:47.269> I

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
chrome but the rust has gone on those I

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.350 
chrome but the rust has gone on those I
think<00:03:48.140> it<00:03:48.440> did<00:03:48.560> a<00:03:48.590> great<00:03:48.799> job<00:03:48.970> these<00:03:49.970> most

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
think it did a great job these most

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.440 
think it did a great job these most
these<00:03:50.480> parts<00:03:50.780> are<00:03:50.989> reusable<00:03:51.680> and<00:03:52.040> I<00:03:52.910> think

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
these parts are reusable and I think

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.319 
these parts are reusable and I think
they<00:03:53.540> look<00:03:53.690> great<00:03:53.750> now<00:03:54.170> and<00:03:54.700> anyway<00:03:55.700> you

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
they look great now and anyway you

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.180 
they look great now and anyway you
should<00:03:56.570> give<00:03:56.989> a<00:03:57.019> vapor<00:03:57.290> or<00:03:57.410> us<00:03:57.590> a<00:03:57.620> try<00:03:57.920> if<00:03:58.100> you

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
should give a vapor or us a try if you

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.500 
should give a vapor or us a try if you
could<00:03:58.310> be<00:03:58.370> working<00:03:58.549> on<00:03:58.730> bikes<00:03:58.970> or<00:03:59.239> doing<00:03:59.450> a
