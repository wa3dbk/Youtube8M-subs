00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:07.560
 Talk about the fla team in half a kilo 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.630
 and welcome everyone to another video 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.910
 Today's game I bring to you 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.009
 no calorie 5 gameplay going 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.509
 serve as a background for people 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.150
 power to chat about the advanced 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.570
 life this match that was playing badly 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.250
 The question is, yes, Maroto was playing. 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.380
 still with coal and military and still 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.750
 I was playing video games and was not playing 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.340
 He ended up selling flex his boxing think 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.800
 going to buy a playstation 4 so 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.050
 he is talking will leave me this 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.120
 More beauty quebec is part of the 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.030
 there the guy has to choose the 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.530
 that you really find more interesting and 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.360
 I'm playing here too with 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.399
 springfield camera I like it 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.710
 Heck, she has a very remarkable sound in the 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.710
 body five is very cool the sound that this 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.260
 easy weapon and I really like her guys 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.840
 added to the changes in the team that is the 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.690
 shorter to play in the court of 5 more 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.359
 Let's talk about the theme of the video of 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.320
 today is what it is about the advanced wars faith and 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:07.380
 guys believe me if you want but the kings 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.600
 cup was withdrawn from advancia in faith or 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.850
 It is if you walk guy is those 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.890
 who likes likes to play gap 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.380
 clix copta that you are of those problems 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.240
 of slope I say problems joking 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.920
 because it's too fucking you to do 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.680
 clicks cop but after you get the 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.290
 morning really the thing ends up is is 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.880
 end up getting better, but finally 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.490
 if you are a guy who likes to do the 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.829
 scope may start to get worried 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.530
 because we are going to have faith it will be very 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.409
 The harder you can do is 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.490
 use this feature in the game 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.420
 I confess to you that you stay a little longer 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.549
 abysmal with this news because 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.100
 usually scopia one of the great 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.320
 future channel attractions and black ops 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.810
 2 the galera in three ministers because the 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.640
 game is the one that has the best option for 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.530
 you do this is much easier than 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.570
 than the other colors but this does not 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.310
 means you do not need to have 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.170
 skill you need without having 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.880
 ability to train for 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.560
 to get the pit stop is not 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.750
 just catch sniper run out 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.160
 map and shoot criticism against everything 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.190
 How much is your side, you need to train one 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.280
 little for you 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:15.070
 q do you offer them coop norge 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.990
 ended up removing it because they 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.060
 found it more interesting to do all the 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.190
 standards more balanced according to 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.620
 own developer all classes 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.150
 weapons will be well balanced and 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.960
 they do that they ended up taking 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.210
 the rank of class snipe or 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.580
 you will not be able to make the ads anymore 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:37.210
 fast than for example a sum shine 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.800
 gum but in the other normal classes 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.590
 the cocktail will be there for you 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.480
 to use this second he was the 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.800
 only way to do this 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.210
 balance to reach this balance 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.220
 Perfect 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.440
 basically they've been there for three years 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.270
 developing the game and since then they have 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.280
 trying to make a perfect balance of 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.050
 game between all classes 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.080
 I confess to you, three years is time. 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:02.080
 hell and hope really 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.550
 Test play well is well balanced because 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.650
 face in the last thing you can 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.960
 to repair, people have a great balance 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.300
 in relation to the weapon classes nÃ© 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.760
 because basically people already with 34 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.440
 gun and all the others are there just to 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.239
 ornament unless you have a 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.250
 weapon that they end up with. 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:21.160
 putting some kind of attack boy 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:24.610
 extremely appealing for example lng 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.459
 Fairy count and finally is very sorry 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.930
 and the staff finishes using 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:32.140
 excessive this type of combination 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.730
 This game is 23 guns and baboons then 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.730
 I hope it does not work, you do not date. 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.100
 really this funk brown filing do 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.080
 make the site more balanced, but 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.910
 also make sure that staff do not lose 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.680
 the urge to play with her because 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.510
 snipper has always been really cool to 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.190
 play and watch others play 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.690
 especially the gringos who like to 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.840
 Do the assembly have some Brazilians. 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.400
 Also in the case of chem and aims in 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.630
 two bars are Brazilian, play to 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.970
 damn sniper 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.730
 so I confess to you that not only one 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.070
 Good sniper face though I admire who 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.180
 You know how to play as fucking as I can. 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.040
 when I'm playing with someone 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.690
 really makes those little pikes mean 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.150
 liar but it's not that the staff 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.610
 sorry liar is the way the game is 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.370
 he has this style more hot air 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.530
 that you have this option of doing what the 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.829
 scope and run out of a retard 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:23.400
 let's say with actions in the hand 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:25.710
 and shooting and killing everyone if you 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.020
 to pull on the realistic side with certainty 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.060
 This is totally wrong indeed. 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.280
 You can not go out with a bar for 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.770
 example in the hand running like crazy and 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.960
 giving scope in the world but at last 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.520
 capture in a video game that has 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.979
 many lying things 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.900
 but the purpose of the game is to amuse the 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:44.879
 people finally I wanted to talk to 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.889
 You expect this even gave me a micro 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:48.930
 long a little more than I should but I 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:50.219
 I wanted to leave the whole match is 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.680
 rolling around because it's not always that I 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:54.000
 I bring a sniper city gameplay was 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.490
 a match that I managed to kill 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.740
 enough to die a little, you did not have a 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.870
 people on the other side and then went 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:04.110
 what you have to do the party playing snip 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:07.110
 of a 15 too many legal scope 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.719
 radar hence the probable date the white part 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.180
 the eye of the opponent quietly in the 

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:13.979
 scope of my snip at last leaves 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.129
 opinion of you what you think in 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:18.779
 about the theme of today 's video is 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:20.879
 people can debate and see what you 

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:23.490
 think about the quiz copied one should not 

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:25.710
 take away anyway how is it going to be 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.509
 And that's it people, thank you very much for the 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.710
 company of yours you see in the 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:30.710
 Next video bye
