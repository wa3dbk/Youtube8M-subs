this winter we'll just not quit today
I've<00:00:08.940> got<00:00:09.000> a<00:00:09.179> question<00:00:09.450> from<00:00:09.780> Joelle<00:00:10.469> who

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
I've got a question from Joelle who

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.160 
I've got a question from Joelle who
wants<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.190> know<00:00:11.250> what<00:00:11.610> is<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:11.910> stop<00:00:12.509> and<00:00:12.840> its

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
wants to know what is a stop and its

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.530 
wants to know what is a stop and its
simplest<00:00:13.559> form<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:14.040> stop<00:00:14.370> is<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:14.730> unit<00:00:15.360> of

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
simplest form a stop is a unit of

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.689 
simplest form a stop is a unit of
measurement<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:16.260> it<00:00:16.529> relates<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.400> amount

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
measurement and it relates to the amount

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.349 
measurement and it relates to the amount
of<00:00:17.940> change<00:00:18.300> in<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:19.410> light<00:00:19.680> captured<00:00:20.520> for<00:00:21.060> an

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
of change in the light captured for an

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.109 
of change in the light captured for an
exposure<00:00:21.859> this<00:00:22.859> relates<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.699> exposure

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
exposure this relates to the exposure

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.330 
exposure this relates to the exposure
indicator<00:00:24.750> on<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:24.930> back<00:00:25.170> here<00:00:25.380> camera<00:00:25.890> when

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
indicator on the back here camera when

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.179 
indicator on the back here camera when
your<00:00:26.490> camera<00:00:26.849> reads<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.300> scene<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:28.320> perfect

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
your camera reads a scene the perfect

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.250 
your camera reads a scene the perfect
amount<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.550> light<00:00:29.820> according<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.779> camera

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
amount of light according to the camera

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.430 
amount of light according to the camera
gives<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:31.949> an<00:00:32.279> exposure<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:33.180> zero<00:00:33.960> on<00:00:34.260> the

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
gives you an exposure of zero on the

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.799 
gives you an exposure of zero on the
indicator<00:00:34.920> when<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:35.579> change<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.329> if<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:36.540> go

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
indicator when you change that if you go

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.069 
indicator when you change that if you go
to<00:00:36.840> plus<00:00:37.290> one<00:00:37.590> or<00:00:37.920> minus<00:00:38.219> 2<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:39.420> are<00:00:39.450> changing

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
to plus one or minus 2 you are changing

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.030 
to plus one or minus 2 you are changing
that<00:00:40.320> in<00:00:40.559> stops<00:00:41.460> plus<00:00:42.450> one<00:00:42.750> stop<00:00:43.110> minus<00:00:43.829> two

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
that in stops plus one stop minus two

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.639 
that in stops plus one stop minus two
stops<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:44.760> when<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.030> change<00:00:45.329> by<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.719> stop<00:00:46.260> you

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
stops so when you change by a stop you

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.529 
stops so when you change by a stop you
either<00:00:46.860> double<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.489> amount<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.850> light<00:00:47.910> coming

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
either double the amount of light coming

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.510 
either double the amount of light coming
into<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.750> camera<00:00:48.809> or<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.649> cut<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.219> half

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
into the camera or you cut it in half

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.340 
into the camera or you cut it in half
for<00:00:50.969> example<00:00:51.390> I'm<00:00:51.480> currently<00:00:51.750> recording<00:00:51.989> this

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
for example I'm currently recording this

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.680 
for example I'm currently recording this
video<00:00:52.590> at<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.010> zero<00:00:53.430> exposure<00:00:53.940> according<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.570> my

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
video at a zero exposure according to my

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.950 
video at a zero exposure according to my
camera<00:00:55.079> if<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.949> overexposed<00:00:56.760> this<00:00:57.030> by<00:00:57.239> one<00:00:57.570> stop

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
camera if I overexposed this by one stop

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.080 
camera if I overexposed this by one stop
it<00:00:58.379> gets<00:00:58.680> twice<00:00:58.949> as<00:00:59.190> bright<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.789> video

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
it gets twice as bright and the video

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.209 
it gets twice as bright and the video
looks<00:01:00.420> like<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:00.870> I've<00:01:01.140> doubled<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.190> amount

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
looks like this I've doubled the amount

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.950 
looks like this I've doubled the amount
of<00:01:02.609> light<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.210> camera<00:01:03.600> is<00:01:03.660> capturing

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
of light that the camera is capturing

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.660 
of light that the camera is capturing
that<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.339> plus<00:01:05.729> one<00:01:06.240> stop<00:01:06.689> change<00:01:07.200> if<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:08.250> go

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
that is a plus one stop change if I go

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.030 
that is a plus one stop change if I go
the<00:01:08.820> opposite<00:01:09.330> direction<00:01:09.590> it's<00:01:10.590> gonna<00:01:10.799> get

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
the opposite direction it's gonna get

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.820 
the opposite direction it's gonna get
darker<00:01:11.430> however<00:01:12.000> when<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.299> go<00:01:12.510> down<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.840> minus

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
darker however when I go down to minus

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.210 
darker however when I go down to minus
one<00:01:14.250> stop<00:01:14.810> relative<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.380> zero<00:01:16.710> exposure

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
one stop relative to the zero exposure

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.149 
one stop relative to the zero exposure
from<00:01:18.030> this<00:01:18.420> point<00:01:18.930> where<00:01:19.200> I'm<00:01:19.380> at<00:01:19.560> right<00:01:19.710> now

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
from this point where I'm at right now

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.179 
from this point where I'm at right now
that's<00:01:20.790> actually<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.479> stop<00:01:22.049> change<00:01:22.439> because

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
that's actually a to stop change because

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.249 
that's actually a to stop change because
first<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:23.850> go<00:01:24.030> back<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.509> zero<00:01:24.780> exposure

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
first I go back to the zero exposure

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.490 
first I go back to the zero exposure
then<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:25.979> have<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.520> go<00:01:26.640> down<00:01:26.939> again<00:01:27.330> minus<00:01:28.200> one

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
then I have to go down again minus one

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.289 
then I have to go down again minus one
and<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:29.009> looks<00:01:29.220> like<00:01:29.430> this<00:01:29.640> which<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:29.970> pretty

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
and it looks like this which is pretty

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.109 
and it looks like this which is pretty
dark<00:01:30.540> isn't<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.439> stop<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:32.189> how<00:01:33.060> we

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
dark isn't it so that stop is how we

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.270 
dark isn't it so that stop is how we
measure<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.659> change<00:01:33.930> in<00:01:34.110> lights<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.650> when<00:01:35.130> we

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
measure the change in lights and when we

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.490 
measure the change in lights and when we
change<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.880> light<00:01:36.060> being<00:01:36.329> recorded<00:01:36.780> by<00:01:37.439> the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
change the light being recorded by the

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.800 
change the light being recorded by the
camera<00:01:38.100> we<00:01:38.400> change<00:01:38.700> one<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.150> three<00:01:39.420> variables

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
camera we change one of three variables

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.660 
camera we change one of three variables
the<00:01:40.200> aperture<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.740> shutter<00:01:40.920> speed<00:01:41.340> or<00:01:41.579> the

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
the aperture the shutter speed or the

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.969 
the aperture the shutter speed or the
ISO<00:01:42.329> this<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:42.930> where<00:01:43.079> things<00:01:43.350> can<00:01:43.680> get<00:01:43.920> a

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
ISO this is where things can get a

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.399 
ISO this is where things can get a
little<00:01:44.040> bit<00:01:44.340> confusing<00:01:44.780> particularly<00:01:45.780> with

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
little bit confusing particularly with

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.530 
little bit confusing particularly with
the<00:01:46.619> aperture<00:01:46.950> because<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.820> aperture<00:01:48.390> is

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
the aperture because the aperture is

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.740 
the aperture because the aperture is
also<00:01:48.990> called<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.439> f-stop<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:51.180> f-stop

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
also called the f-stop and the f-stop

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.499 
also called the f-stop and the f-stop
and<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.439> stop<00:01:52.799> are<00:01:53.009> two<00:01:53.340> different<00:01:53.970> things<00:01:54.240> but

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
and a stop are two different things but

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.209 
and a stop are two different things but
sometimes<00:01:55.110> people<00:01:55.320> think<00:01:55.710> they're<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:55.979> same

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
sometimes people think they're the same

sometimes people think they're the same
the<00:01:57.030> f-stop<00:01:57.719> refers<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:59.009> specific

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
the f-stop refers to the specific

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.880 
the f-stop refers to the specific
aperture<00:02:00.570> setting<00:02:01.020> on<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.409> camera

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
aperture setting on the camera

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.069 
aperture setting on the camera
for<00:02:02.490> example<00:02:03.380> f/4<00:02:04.409> is<00:02:04.710> an<00:02:05.280> f-stop<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.509> stop

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
for example f/4 is an f-stop a stop

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.040 
for example f/4 is an f-stop a stop
refers<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:08.039> amount<00:02:08.399> of<00:02:08.610> change<00:02:09.030> of<00:02:09.450> light

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
refers to the amount of change of light

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.520 
refers to the amount of change of light

stop<00:02:17.940> change<00:02:18.390> you<00:02:19.140> can<00:02:19.290> do<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.500> same<00:02:19.740> thing

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
stop change you can do the same thing

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.860 
stop change you can do the same thing
with<00:02:20.160> your<00:02:20.280> shutter<00:02:20.580> speed<00:02:20.910> you<00:02:21.120> can<00:02:21.540> go<00:02:21.660> from

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
with your shutter speed you can go from

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.020 
with your shutter speed you can go from
one<00:02:22.140> thirtieth<00:02:22.590> of<00:02:22.800> a<00:02:22.890> second<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.700> one

one<00:02:27.000> stop<00:02:27.300> change<00:02:27.690> you<00:02:28.350> could<00:02:28.530> go<00:02:28.680> from<00:02:28.890> ISO

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
one stop change you could go from ISO

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.620

200<00:02:30.239> to<00:02:30.569> ISO<00:02:31.050> 400<00:02:31.380> which<00:02:32.220> would<00:02:32.459> be<00:02:32.610> a<00:02:32.790> plus<00:02:33.180> one

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
200 to ISO 400 which would be a plus one

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.900 
200 to ISO 400 which would be a plus one
stop<00:02:33.989> change<00:02:34.410> so<00:02:35.069> we<00:02:35.190> measure<00:02:35.400> these<00:02:35.610> things

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
stop change so we measure these things

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.610 
stop change so we measure these things
in<00:02:36.090> stops<00:02:36.390> now<00:02:36.870> there's<00:02:37.080> something<00:02:37.380> else<00:02:37.530> that

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
in stops now there's something else that

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.110 
in stops now there's something else that
I<00:02:37.770> should<00:02:37.950> mention<00:02:38.100> which<00:02:38.400> is<00:02:38.430> that<00:02:38.760> pretty

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
I should mention which is that pretty

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.090 
I should mention which is that pretty
much<00:02:39.209> every<00:02:39.720> camera<00:02:40.080> can<00:02:40.709> change<00:02:40.980> the

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
much every camera can change the

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.160 
much every camera can change the
aperture<00:02:41.459> and<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.790> shutter<00:02:41.850> speed<00:02:42.420> in<00:02:42.569> one

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
aperture and the shutter speed in one

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.590 
aperture and the shutter speed in one
third<00:02:43.680> stop<00:02:44.040> increments<00:02:44.730> which<00:02:45.090> is<00:02:45.270> really

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
third stop increments which is really

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.170 
third stop increments which is really
nice<00:02:45.750> because<00:02:46.140> this<00:02:46.320> gives<00:02:46.620> us<00:02:46.830> extra<00:02:47.519> control

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
nice because this gives us extra control

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.570 
nice because this gives us extra control
over<00:02:48.720> our<00:02:48.840> exposure<00:02:49.350> that<00:02:50.100> way<00:02:50.220> if<00:02:50.340> you<00:02:50.430> need

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
over our exposure that way if you need

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.340 
over our exposure that way if you need
just<00:02:50.880> a<00:02:50.970> little<00:02:51.360> bit<00:02:51.510> brighter<00:02:51.660> or<00:02:52.080> just<00:02:52.260> a

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
just a little bit brighter or just a

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.259 
just a little bit brighter or just a
little<00:02:52.620> bit<00:02:52.950> darker<00:02:53.370> you<00:02:53.489> can<00:02:53.519> do<00:02:53.880> that<00:02:54.090> which

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
little bit darker you can do that which

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:55.550 
little bit darker you can do that which
is<00:02:54.300> really<00:02:54.810> very<00:02:55.019> nice

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
is really very nice

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.640 
is really very nice
now<00:02:56.310> some<00:02:56.820> cameras<00:02:57.300> also<00:02:57.900> allow<00:02:58.410> you<00:02:58.470> to

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
now some cameras also allow you to

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.800 
now some cameras also allow you to
change<00:02:59.010> your<00:02:59.160> ISO<00:02:59.370> in<00:03:00.000> one<00:03:00.269> third<00:03:00.510> stop

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
change your ISO in one third stop

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.320 
change your ISO in one third stop
increments<00:03:01.440> so<00:03:01.830> go<00:03:02.130> into<00:03:02.280> your<00:03:02.430> ISO<00:03:02.910> settings

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
increments so go into your ISO settings

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
increments so go into your ISO settings
if<00:03:03.480> you<00:03:03.630> see<00:03:03.870> 100<00:03:04.830> 125<00:03:05.840> 160<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:06.959> then<00:03:07.019> 200

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
if you see 100 125 160 and then 200

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.410 
if you see 100 125 160 and then 200
you're<00:03:08.160> dealing<00:03:08.519> with<00:03:08.550> one<00:03:08.940> third<00:03:09.150> stop

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
you're dealing with one third stop

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.130 
you're dealing with one third stop
increments

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
increments

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.650 
increments
now<00:03:10.590> knowing<00:03:10.950> how<00:03:11.100> a<00:03:11.130> stop<00:03:11.430> works<00:03:11.819> and<00:03:12.209> what<00:03:12.630> a

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
now knowing how a stop works and what a

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.920 
now knowing how a stop works and what a
stop<00:03:12.959> is<00:03:13.260> allows<00:03:14.010> you<00:03:14.040> to<00:03:14.250> maintain<00:03:14.580> or<00:03:15.180> adjust

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
stop is allows you to maintain or adjust

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.890 
stop is allows you to maintain or adjust
your<00:03:16.080> exposure<00:03:16.230> very<00:03:17.220> precisely<00:03:17.700> for<00:03:18.390> example

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
your exposure very precisely for example

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.479 
your exposure very precisely for example
if<00:03:19.019> you're<00:03:19.230> looking<00:03:19.709> at<00:03:19.860> your<00:03:19.950> scene<00:03:20.250> and

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
if you're looking at your scene and

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.030 
if you're looking at your scene and
you've<00:03:21.180> taken<00:03:21.390> a<00:03:21.660> zero<00:03:21.930> exposure<00:03:22.380> shot<00:03:22.769> and

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
you've taken a zero exposure shot and

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.470 
you've taken a zero exposure shot and
that's<00:03:23.190> not<00:03:23.430> bright<00:03:23.670> enough<00:03:23.700> for<00:03:24.150> you<00:03:24.269> you

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
that's not bright enough for you you

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.150 
that's not bright enough for you you
want<00:03:24.900> to<00:03:24.989> increase<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.500> amount<00:03:25.860> of<00:03:25.950> light

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
want to increase the amount of light

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.250 
want to increase the amount of light
let's<00:03:26.820> say<00:03:27.060> you<00:03:27.120> want<00:03:27.450> to<00:03:27.570> double<00:03:27.870> it<00:03:27.930> to<00:03:28.079> keep

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
let's say you want to double it to keep

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.020 
let's say you want to double it to keep
it<00:03:28.440> simple<00:03:28.799> you<00:03:29.010> want<00:03:29.130> to<00:03:29.310> increase<00:03:29.760> your

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
it simple you want to increase your

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.020 
it simple you want to increase your
exposure<00:03:30.120> by<00:03:30.720> one<00:03:31.049> stop<00:03:31.530> to<00:03:32.280> do<00:03:32.459> that<00:03:32.730> you

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
exposure by one stop to do that you

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.850 
exposure by one stop to do that you
could<00:03:33.239> either<00:03:33.420> open<00:03:33.930> up<00:03:34.019> your<00:03:34.200> aperture<00:03:34.530> by

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
could either open up your aperture by

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.789 
could either open up your aperture by
one<00:03:35.070> stop<00:03:35.370> so<00:03:36.060> you<00:03:36.090> could<00:03:36.360> say<00:03:36.630> go<00:03:36.900> from<00:03:37.170> f/4

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
one stop so you could say go from f/4

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.819 
one stop so you could say go from f/4
to<00:03:38.130> F<00:03:38.280> 2.8<00:03:39.000> you<00:03:39.510> could<00:03:39.690> slow<00:03:40.380> down<00:03:40.590> your

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
to F 2.8 you could slow down your

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.620 
to F 2.8 you could slow down your
shutter<00:03:41.070> speed<00:03:41.160> by<00:03:41.670> going<00:03:41.970> from<00:03:42.150> one<00:03:42.239> one

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
one sixtieth of a second or you could

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.319 
one sixtieth of a second or you could
increase<00:03:48.540> your<00:03:48.660> ISO<00:03:49.019> from<00:03:49.739> say<00:03:50.010> 200<00:03:50.670> to<00:03:50.760> 400

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
increase your ISO from say 200 to 400

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.780 
increase your ISO from say 200 to 400
each<00:03:51.900> one<00:03:52.260> of<00:03:52.380> those<00:03:52.500> options<00:03:52.829> would<00:03:53.549> allow

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
each one of those options would allow

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.569 
each one of those options would allow
you<00:03:53.850> to<00:03:54.269> increase<00:03:54.750> your<00:03:54.870> exposure<00:03:55.170> by<00:03:55.680> +1<00:03:56.280> stop

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
you to increase your exposure by +1 stop

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.849 
you to increase your exposure by +1 stop
capturing<00:03:57.510> twice<00:03:57.840> as<00:03:58.019> much<00:03:58.200> light<00:03:58.500> for<00:03:58.739> the

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
capturing twice as much light for the

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.009 
capturing twice as much light for the
exposure<00:03:59.250> now<00:04:00.180> let's<00:04:00.420> say<00:04:00.570> you<00:04:00.630> want<00:04:00.870> to<00:04:00.900> do

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
exposure now let's say you want to do

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.050 
exposure now let's say you want to do
something<00:04:01.380> different<00:04:01.799> let's<00:04:02.489> say<00:04:02.700> you<00:04:02.760> want

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
something different let's say you want

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.509 
something different let's say you want
to<00:04:03.120> maintain<00:04:03.450> your<00:04:03.870> exposure<00:04:04.590> but<00:04:05.220> you<00:04:05.310> need

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
to maintain your exposure but you need

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.120 
to maintain your exposure but you need
to<00:04:05.640> change<00:04:05.940> your<00:04:06.299> variables<00:04:06.959> because<00:04:07.890> you

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
to change your variables because you

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.370 
to change your variables because you
need<00:04:08.310> to<00:04:08.430> change<00:04:08.790> how<00:04:09.150> the<00:04:09.209> actual<00:04:09.870> photograph

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
need to change how the actual photograph

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.770 
need to change how the actual photograph
looks<00:04:10.739> based<00:04:11.070> upon<00:04:11.340> those<00:04:11.489> variables<00:04:12.060> let's

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
looks based upon those variables let's

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.219 
looks based upon those variables let's
say<00:04:12.959> you're<00:04:13.170> starting<00:04:13.410> at<00:04:13.680> ISO<00:04:14.220> 200<00:04:14.880> at<00:04:15.229> f4

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
say you're starting at ISO 200 at f4

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.469 
say you're starting at ISO 200 at f4
with<00:04:16.950> a<00:04:16.979> shutter<00:04:17.280> speed<00:04:17.489> of<00:04:17.640> one<00:04:18.030> one

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
with a shutter speed of one one

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.690 
with a shutter speed of one one
twentieth<00:04:18.900> of<00:04:19.049> a<00:04:19.169> second<00:04:19.560> with<00:04:20.160> this<00:04:20.430> shot

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
twentieth of a second with this shot

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.270 
twentieth of a second with this shot
we've<00:04:21.299> taken<00:04:21.570> a<00:04:21.780> test<00:04:22.019> and<00:04:22.260> we<00:04:22.320> realize<00:04:22.680> okay<00:04:23.099> I

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
we've taken a test and we realize okay I

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.730 
we've taken a test and we realize okay I
want<00:04:23.729> to<00:04:23.849> increase<00:04:24.270> my<00:04:24.390> depth<00:04:24.840> of<00:04:25.050> field<00:04:25.289> here

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
want to increase my depth of field here

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.290 
want to increase my depth of field here
because<00:04:26.310> I<00:04:26.340> don't<00:04:26.610> have<00:04:26.820> enough

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
because I don't have enough

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.830 
because I don't have enough
so<00:04:27.569> I<00:04:27.599> want<00:04:27.900> to<00:04:27.960> go<00:04:28.080> from<00:04:28.289> f4<00:04:28.949> to<00:04:29.370> f5<00:04:29.880> point<00:04:30.300> six

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
so I want to go from f4 to f5 point six

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.680 
so I want to go from f4 to f5 point six
when<00:04:31.440> I<00:04:31.470> do<00:04:31.620> that<00:04:31.919> that<00:04:32.280> is<00:04:32.490> a<00:04:32.520> -<00:04:33.150> one<00:04:33.360> stop

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
when I do that that is a - one stop

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.980 
when I do that that is a - one stop
change<00:04:34.080> to<00:04:34.380> the<00:04:34.530> exposure<00:04:35.240> now<00:04:36.240> if<00:04:36.419> I<00:04:36.539> need<00:04:36.780> to

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
change to the exposure now if I need to

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.219 
change to the exposure now if I need to
maintain<00:04:37.169> that<00:04:37.530> exposure<00:04:37.949> at<00:04:38.280> zero<00:04:38.610> I<00:04:38.910> know

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:39.229 
maintain that exposure at zero I know

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:41.689 
maintain that exposure at zero I know
that<00:04:40.229> I've<00:04:40.349> made<00:04:40.380> a<00:04:40.620> one<00:04:40.919> stop<00:04:41.160> change<00:04:41.520> in

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:41.699 
that I've made a one stop change in

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:44.270 
that I've made a one stop change in
aperture<00:04:42.000> and<00:04:42.389> if<00:04:42.840> I<00:04:42.990> make<00:04:43.199> a<00:04:43.229> one<00:04:43.620> stop<00:04:43.889> change

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
aperture and if I make a one stop change

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.640 
aperture and if I make a one stop change
in<00:04:44.430> the<00:04:44.520> opposite<00:04:45.030> direction<00:04:45.180> in<00:04:45.750> shutter

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
in the opposite direction in shutter

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.490 
in the opposite direction in shutter
speed<00:04:47.009> or<00:04:47.220> ISO<00:04:47.940> I<00:04:48.150> will<00:04:48.630> bring<00:04:48.870> my<00:04:49.080> exposure

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
speed or ISO I will bring my exposure

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.159 
speed or ISO I will bring my exposure
back<00:04:49.919> into<00:04:50.190> balance<00:04:50.340> okay<00:04:51.330> guys<00:04:51.509> that's<00:04:51.930> all
