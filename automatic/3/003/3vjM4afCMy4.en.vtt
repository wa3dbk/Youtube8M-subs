00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.890
 here from all against all we want 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.970
 what 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:37.970
 I already remembered that it's about the elderly 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.970
 Sun 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.740
 cut to see 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:56.650
 it's like 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.650
 if things were weird 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.210
 all must be knocked down can not be 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.210
 die 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:14.280
 good if you can die well what else 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.280
 we have 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.540
 look how you came out good 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:35.200
 Well, this survival, as the 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:39.760
 name is to survive 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:43.390
 they are served and they give you this is something 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:47.170
 very mobile that they have added to it is 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:52.260
 alser see that they notice things of stones 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.260
 as you see, you have grass things 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:03.330
 you have everything all everything all objects 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:05.810
 of iron and you come with an armor of 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.810
 Diamond 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.620
 Well, what else is there to do here? 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:19.120
 good 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:22.440
 survive I think I already said 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.440
 while the one here 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.650
 and 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.940
 now they will come to kill me their points 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.940
 would be the right ones 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.960
 and the gas the air game 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.960
 if there they come to pick up 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.680
 but as fuck 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.680
 good 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.430
 I just wanted to show you this server 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:06.040
 and if they are cargoes these 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:17.340
 it's for the only thing that they serve to hinder 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:21.290
 good 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.290
 and I think the following way 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.800
 in the body it is called 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.030
 is 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:36.069
 then I'm sure 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:42.099
 good panistas server and also 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:49.920
 as you can 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:52.430
 not because it's how they served here 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.430
 I know that 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:03.780
 you have to kill yourself 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.780
