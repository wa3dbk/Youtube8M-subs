again practice with both of them and see

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.060 
again practice with both of them and see
which<00:02:10.359> one<00:02:10.570> you<00:02:10.600> like<00:02:10.750> so<00:02:11.620> let's<00:02:11.829> turn<00:02:12.010> around

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
which one you like so let's turn around

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.890 
which one you like so let's turn around
here<00:02:12.609> and<00:02:12.640> shoot<00:02:12.970> a<00:02:13.030> little<00:02:13.180> bit<00:02:13.269> take<00:02:13.630> a<00:02:13.660> look

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
here and shoot a little bit take a look

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.470 
here and shoot a little bit take a look
at<00:02:14.049> it<00:02:14.700> which<00:02:15.700> of<00:02:15.850> these<00:02:15.940> techniques<00:02:16.299> will

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
at it which of these techniques will

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.340 
at it which of these techniques will
work<00:02:16.510> better<00:02:16.810> for<00:02:17.019> you

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
work better for you

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.500 
work better for you
that's<00:02:17.709> totally<00:02:18.070> up<00:02:18.160> you<00:02:18.400> let's<00:02:19.060> shoot<00:02:19.269> both

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
that's totally up you let's shoot both

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.030 
that's totally up you let's shoot both
of<00:02:19.570> them<00:02:19.900> let<00:02:20.079> you<00:02:20.170> take<00:02:20.350> a<00:02:20.380> look<00:02:20.590> at<00:02:20.799> them<00:02:20.920> and

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
of them let you take a look at them and

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.210 
of them let you take a look at them and
see<00:02:21.130> how<00:02:21.190> it<00:02:21.340> works<00:02:22.829> we're<00:02:23.829> going<00:02:23.950> to<00:02:24.040> shoot

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
see how it works we're going to shoot

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.550 
see how it works we're going to shoot
the<00:02:24.370> first<00:02:24.549> three<00:02:25.000> rounds<00:02:25.209> using<00:02:26.049> that<00:02:26.320> kind

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
the first three rounds using that kind

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.170 
the first three rounds using that kind
of<00:02:26.620> a<00:02:26.709> natural<00:02:27.160> can't<00:02:27.459> to<00:02:27.609> the<00:02:27.700> side<00:02:27.940> like

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
of a natural can't to the side like

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.910 
of a natural can't to the side like
you're<00:02:28.299> pointing<00:02:28.630> your<00:02:28.660> finger<00:02:29.109> shooting<00:02:29.829> on

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
you're pointing your finger shooting on

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.160 
you're pointing your finger shooting on
the<00:02:30.040> steel-plated<00:02:30.670> about<00:02:30.970> 25<00:02:31.510> feet<00:02:31.540> let's<00:02:32.049> see

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
the steel-plated about 25 feet let's see

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.720 
the steel-plated about 25 feet let's see
how<00:02:32.260> we<00:02:32.319> do<00:02:34.829> works<00:02:35.829> pretty<00:02:36.069> good<00:02:36.190> get<00:02:36.579> some

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
how we do works pretty good get some

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.580 
how we do works pretty good get some
pretty<00:02:36.940> fast<00:02:37.209> hits<00:02:37.510> probably<00:02:38.200> a<00:02:38.230> quarter

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
pretty fast hits probably a quarter

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.250 
pretty fast hits probably a quarter
second<00:02:38.950> apart<00:02:39.250> now<00:02:39.910> let's<00:02:40.209> try<00:02:40.420> rotating<00:02:41.200> that

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
second apart now let's try rotating that

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.170 
second apart now let's try rotating that
elbow<00:02:41.680> down<00:02:41.949> bringing<00:02:42.639> the<00:02:42.850> gun<00:02:43.000> a<00:02:43.030> little

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
elbow down bringing the gun a little

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.410 
elbow down bringing the gun a little
more<00:02:43.419> upright<00:02:43.750> see<00:02:44.139> how<00:02:44.260> that<00:02:44.440> works<00:02:44.680> for<00:02:44.799> us

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.540 

okay<00:02:49.420> through<00:02:49.900> one<00:02:50.140> honestly<00:02:50.710> I'm<00:02:51.010> trying<00:02:51.370> to

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
okay through one honestly I'm trying to

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:52.980 
okay through one honestly I'm trying to
use<00:02:51.760> a<00:02:51.790> technique<00:02:52.330> that<00:02:52.540> I<00:02:52.630> don't<00:02:52.840> usually

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
use a technique that I don't usually

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.200 
use a technique that I don't usually
shoot<00:02:53.410> because<00:02:53.680> I<00:02:54.040> shoot<00:02:54.520> with<00:02:54.640> my<00:02:54.790> gun<00:02:54.970> kind

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.210 
shoot because I shoot with my gun kind

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.180 
shoot because I shoot with my gun kind
of<00:02:55.270> the<00:02:55.390> side<00:02:55.630> you<00:02:56.020> know<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.770> only<00:02:56.950> way<00:02:57.130> you

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
of the side you know the only way you

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.730 
of the side you know the only way you
can<00:02:57.490> learn<00:02:57.730> is<00:02:58.090> by<00:02:58.450> missing<00:02:59.110> and<00:02:59.260> that<00:02:59.320> sounds

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
can learn is by missing and that sounds

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.120 
can learn is by missing and that sounds
terrible<00:03:00.220> but<00:03:00.280> it's<00:03:00.520> true<00:03:01.560> let's<00:03:02.560> try<00:03:02.860> it<00:03:02.920> with

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
terrible but it's true let's try it with

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.890 
terrible but it's true let's try it with
the<00:03:03.250> we<00:03:03.370> can<00:03:03.670> we're<00:03:03.940> going<00:03:04.030> to<00:03:04.120> use<00:03:04.300> the<00:03:04.450> Canton

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
the we can we're going to use the Canton

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:05.550 
the we can we're going to use the Canton
one<00:03:05.050> first

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
one first

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.590 
one first
see<00:03:05.740> how<00:03:05.830> that<00:03:05.890> works<00:03:06.220> out<00:03:06.430> I<00:03:09.000> missed<00:03:10.000> one<00:03:10.210> my

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
see how that works out I missed one my

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.540 
see how that works out I missed one my
rate<00:03:10.810> of<00:03:10.930> fire<00:03:11.140> was<00:03:11.320> a<00:03:11.350> little<00:03:11.650> slower<00:03:11.890> not<00:03:12.310> to

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
rate of fire was a little slower not to

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.520 
rate of fire was a little slower not to
have<00:03:12.730> unusual<00:03:13.360> because<00:03:13.510> I'm<00:03:13.810> using<00:03:14.050> a<00:03:14.260> hand

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
have unusual because I'm using a hand

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.260 
have unusual because I'm using a hand
that<00:03:14.710> I<00:03:14.740> don't<00:03:15.040> use<00:03:15.310> as<00:03:15.550> often<00:03:15.850> as<00:03:16.120> I<00:03:16.240> should

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
that I don't use as often as I should

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.200 
that I don't use as often as I should
let's<00:03:17.260> try<00:03:17.530> a<00:03:17.560> locking<00:03:18.070> that<00:03:18.190> elbow<00:03:18.580> down<00:03:18.850> and

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.210 
let's try a locking that elbow down and

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.210 
let's try a locking that elbow down and
getting<00:03:20.050> that<00:03:20.140> thumb<00:03:20.530> a<00:03:20.560> little<00:03:20.830> bit<00:03:20.950> forward

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
getting that thumb a little bit forward

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.010 
getting that thumb a little bit forward
see<00:03:21.700> how<00:03:21.820> that<00:03:22.000> works<00:03:22.210> for<00:03:22.330> us

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.150 

okay<00:03:26.020> that<00:03:26.200> worked<00:03:26.410> out<00:03:26.590> a<00:03:26.620> little<00:03:26.860> bit<00:03:26.980> better

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
okay that worked out a little bit better

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.340 
okay that worked out a little bit better
I<00:03:27.280> hit<00:03:27.550> all<00:03:27.580> the<00:03:27.730> shots<00:03:28.090> which<00:03:28.600> one<00:03:28.870> you<00:03:29.080> choose

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
I hit all the shots which one you choose

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.680 
I hit all the shots which one you choose
you<00:03:29.620> know<00:03:29.830> what<00:03:30.040> it's<00:03:30.250> totally<00:03:30.490> up<00:03:30.790> to<00:03:30.820> you<00:03:31.150> my

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
you know what it's totally up to you my

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.750 
you know what it's totally up to you my
suggestion<00:03:32.200> is<00:03:32.440> try<00:03:32.830> them<00:03:32.980> both<00:03:33.190> see<00:03:33.610> which

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
suggestion is try them both see which

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.640 
suggestion is try them both see which
one<00:03:33.940> works<00:03:34.180> for<00:03:34.300> you<00:03:34.510> which<00:03:35.110> one<00:03:35.290> feels<00:03:35.470> more

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
one works for you which one feels more

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.220 
one works for you which one feels more
natural<00:03:35.800> and<00:03:36.460> then<00:03:37.000> like<00:03:37.540> I'm<00:03:37.810> going<00:03:38.080> to<00:03:38.110> be

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
natural and then like I'm going to be

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.610 
natural and then like I'm going to be
doing<00:03:38.610> practice
