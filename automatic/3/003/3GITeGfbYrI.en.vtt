alright guys check it out mmm I

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.420 
alright guys check it out mmm I
programmed<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.720> Taylor<00:00:22.050> ons<00:00:22.260> on<00:00:22.529> my<00:00:22.800> Taranis

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430

programmed the Taylor ons on my Taranis
so<00:00:23.910> check<00:00:24.119> out<00:00:24.240> here<00:00:24.449> it<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.600> everything<00:00:25.170> off

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
so check out here it is everything off

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.690 
so check out here it is everything off
thrust<00:00:26.099> vector<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.560> tailings<00:00:28.560> off<00:00:29.000> elevator

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
I have TV on this switch and now we have

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.940 
I have TV on this switch and now we have
CV<00:00:36.870> active<00:00:37.430> okay<00:00:38.430> now<00:00:38.879> my<00:00:39.379> tail<00:00:40.379> runs<00:00:40.680> are<00:00:40.920> on

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
CV active okay now my tail runs are on

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.830 
CV active okay now my tail runs are on
switch<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:42.149> turn<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.600> on

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
switch a so I turn that on

on a switch elevator okay no prospector

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.370 
on a switch elevator okay no prospector
here's<00:01:25.229> my<00:01:25.380> thrust<00:01:25.860> vectors<00:01:26.250> on<00:01:26.400> switch<00:01:26.820> D<00:01:27.450> so

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
here's my thrust vectors on switch D so

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.240 
here's my thrust vectors on switch D so
there<00:01:28.560> we<00:01:28.680> have<00:01:28.829> stress<00:01:29.159> vector<00:01:30.530> now<00:01:31.530> turn<00:01:31.920> the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
there we have stress vector now turn the

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.340 
there we have stress vector now turn the
Taylor<00:01:32.640> ons<00:01:32.909> on<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.479> haven't<00:01:33.780> programmed<00:01:34.020> the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
Taylor ons on I haven't programmed the

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.690 
Taylor ons on I haven't programmed the
voice<00:01:34.500> alerts<00:01:34.829> yet<00:01:35.009> but<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.250> will

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
voice alerts yet but I will

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:45.660 
voice alerts yet but I will
okay<00:01:36.420> now<00:01:36.869> we<00:01:36.930> have<00:01:37.170> parents<00:01:42.020> school

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.070 

turn<00:01:46.670> the<00:01:46.759> prospector<00:01:47.360> off<00:01:49.720> we<00:01:50.720> have<00:01:50.840> a<00:01:50.869> lawn

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
turn the prospector off we have a lawn

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.539 
turn the prospector off we have a lawn
so<00:01:51.290> there<00:01:51.380> you<00:01:51.470> go<00:01:51.619> guys<00:01:51.830> I<00:01:51.890> can<00:01:52.190> turn<00:01:52.369> it<00:01:52.460> off

so there you go guys I can turn it off

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:58.210 
so there you go guys I can turn it off
on<00:01:52.759> the<00:01:52.790> switch<00:01:53.950> just<00:01:54.950> off<00:01:56.170> sweet<00:01:57.170> all<00:01:58.070> right

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
on the switch just off sweet all right

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.100 
on the switch just off sweet all right
you<00:01:58.310> guys<00:01:58.430> might<00:01:58.759> wonder<00:01:58.970> how<00:01:59.149> ICO<00:01:59.780> Graham<00:01:59.990> the

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
you guys might wonder how ICO Graham the

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.550 
you guys might wonder how ICO Graham the
P<00:02:00.290> let's<00:02:00.590> check<00:02:00.860> it<00:02:01.009> out<00:02:01.780> so<00:02:02.780> just<00:02:03.200> went<00:02:03.380> into

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
P let's check it out so just went into

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.930 
P let's check it out so just went into
the<00:02:03.619> menu<00:02:04.070> went<00:02:04.759> to<00:02:04.880> my<00:02:05.000> mixes<00:02:05.450> menu<00:02:06.610> okay<00:02:07.610> I

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
the menu went to my mixes menu okay I

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.570 
the menu went to my mixes menu okay I
went<00:02:08.239> to<00:02:08.509> have<00:02:08.959> all<00:02:09.140> my<00:02:09.170> servos<00:02:10.009> on<00:02:10.190> separate

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
went to have all my servos on separate

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.710 
went to have all my servos on separate
channels<00:02:11.000> so<00:02:11.270> I<00:02:11.510> went<00:02:12.170> down<00:02:12.350> to<00:02:12.590> elevator

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
channels so I went down to elevator

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.979 
channels so I went down to elevator
channel<00:02:14.720> two<00:02:14.900> I<00:02:15.290> created<00:02:16.040> a<00:02:16.160> name<00:02:16.340> line<00:02:16.989> which

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
channel two I created a name line which

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:23.020 
channel two I created a name line which
was<00:02:18.200> this<00:02:18.380> one<00:02:18.680> I<00:02:21.640> said<00:02:22.640> it<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:22.850> name<00:02:23.000> of

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
was this one I said it the name of

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.660 
was this one I said it the name of
Taylor<00:02:23.330> on<00:02:23.660> source<00:02:24.230> was<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.590> aileron<00:02:25.040> and<00:02:25.280> the

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
Taylor on source was the aileron and the

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.720 
Taylor on source was the aileron and the
weight<00:02:25.850> was<00:02:26.030> minus<00:02:26.360> 60<00:02:26.720> so<00:02:26.750> I<00:02:26.900> could<00:02:27.050> match<00:02:27.260> the

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
weight was minus 60 so I could match the

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.320 
weight was minus 60 so I could match the
corresponding<00:02:28.730> aileron<00:02:29.510> and<00:02:30.880> its<00:02:31.880> tone<00:02:32.120> down

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
corresponding aileron and its tone down

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.120 
corresponding aileron and its tone down
to<00:02:32.480> mine<00:02:32.630> 60-100<00:02:33.380> would<00:02:33.800> be<00:02:33.890> a<00:02:33.920> hundred

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
to mine 60-100 would be a hundred

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.699 
to mine 60-100 would be a hundred
percent<00:02:34.550> so<00:02:34.670> it's<00:02:34.819> about<00:02:35.000> sixty<00:02:35.420> percent<00:02:35.709> okay

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
percent so it's about sixty percent okay

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.100 
percent so it's about sixty percent okay
I<00:02:36.739> have<00:02:37.040> it<00:02:37.130> on<00:02:37.190> switch<00:02:37.610> se<00:02:38.540> if<00:02:38.690> you<00:02:38.780> can<00:02:38.900> see

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
I have it on switch se if you can see

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:50.910 
I have it on switch se if you can see
that<00:02:39.290> okay<00:02:42.220> yeah<00:02:43.220> same<00:02:43.640> thing<00:02:43.880> for<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.299> right
