hi guys today we're going to be working
on<00:00:13.490> the<00:00:13.850> super<00:00:14.420> easy<00:00:14.750> to<00:00:15.260> color<00:00:15.500> sponge<00:00:16.010> design

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
on the super easy to color sponge design

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.840 
on the super easy to color sponge design
and<00:00:16.820> this<00:00:17.779> was<00:00:17.990> actually<00:00:18.500> inspired<00:00:18.920> by<00:00:19.279> some

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
and this was actually inspired by some

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.410 
and this was actually inspired by some
of<00:00:20.000> the<00:00:20.090> Sally<00:00:20.390> Hansen<00:00:21.020> nail<00:00:21.050> strips<00:00:21.980> I<00:00:22.369> saw<00:00:23.240> a

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
of the Sally Hansen nail strips I saw a

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.040 
of the Sally Hansen nail strips I saw a
set<00:00:23.720> when<00:00:24.020> I<00:00:24.050> was<00:00:24.290> at<00:00:24.439> Target<00:00:24.710> that<00:00:25.310> was<00:00:26.050> pretty

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
set when I was at Target that was pretty

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.990 
set when I was at Target that was pretty
similar<00:00:27.470> to<00:00:27.500> this<00:00:27.770> except<00:00:28.250> instead<00:00:28.520> of<00:00:28.760> black

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
similar to this except instead of black

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.750 
similar to this except instead of black
it<00:00:29.240> was<00:00:29.330> using<00:00:29.720> white<00:00:30.100> so<00:00:31.100> if<00:00:31.340> you'd<00:00:31.460> like<00:00:31.490> to

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760 
it was using white so if you'd like to

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.320 
it was using white so if you'd like to
see<00:00:31.940> how<00:00:32.090> I<00:00:32.119> did<00:00:32.239> it<00:00:32.510> just<00:00:33.470> stay<00:00:33.620> tuned<00:00:33.890> I

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:34.330 
see how I did it just stay tuned I

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.850 
see how I did it just stay tuned I
started<00:00:35.330> out<00:00:35.449> with<00:00:35.540> a<00:00:35.600> white<00:00:35.900> base<00:00:36.170> just<00:00:36.739> to

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
started out with a white base just to

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.420 
cruiser and that's Orly also and I have
just<00:00:55.160> like<00:00:55.340> I<00:00:55.430> normally<00:00:55.489> do<00:00:56.090> just<00:00:56.840> a<00:00:57.430> plain

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
just like I normally do just a plain

just like I normally do just a plain
basic<00:00:58.879> makeup<00:00:59.510> sponge<00:00:59.840> and<00:01:02.230> instead<00:01:03.230> of<00:01:03.289> just

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
basic makeup sponge and instead of just

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.800 
basic makeup sponge and instead of just
putting<00:01:04.129> the<00:01:04.339> colors<00:01:04.640> down<00:01:04.850> in<00:01:05.089> a<00:01:05.180> line<00:01:05.449> I'm

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
putting the colors down in a line I'm

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.590 
putting the colors down in a line I'm
basically<00:01:06.200> going<00:01:06.440> to<00:01:06.500> put<00:01:06.710> down<00:01:07.030> the<00:01:08.030> black<00:01:08.330> on

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
basically going to put down the black on

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.810 
basically going to put down the black on
the<00:01:08.780> edges<00:01:09.200> and<00:01:09.500> the<00:01:09.860> pink<00:01:10.130> in<00:01:10.340> the<00:01:10.520> middle

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
the edges and the pink in the middle

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.340 
the edges and the pink in the middle
just<00:01:11.539> like<00:01:11.660> it<00:01:11.869> is<00:01:12.020> gonna<00:01:12.560> be<00:01:12.740> on<00:01:12.920> the<00:01:13.070> nail<00:01:13.280> and

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
just like it is gonna be on the nail and

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.650 
just like it is gonna be on the nail and
it's<00:01:15.350> just<00:01:15.619> my<00:01:16.039> personal<00:01:16.759> preference<00:01:17.119> to

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
it's just my personal preference to

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.800 
it's just my personal preference to
start<00:01:18.229> out<00:01:18.440> with<00:01:19.369> the<00:01:19.520> darker<00:01:19.910> color<00:01:19.940> first<00:01:20.509> on

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
start out with the darker color first on

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.100 
start out with the darker color first on
the<00:01:20.929> sponge<00:01:21.170> and<00:01:22.569> it's<00:01:23.569> just<00:01:23.780> been<00:01:23.959> in<00:01:24.080> my

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
the sponge and it's just been in my

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.680 
the sponge and it's just been in my
opinion<00:01:24.740> that<00:01:24.770> that<00:01:24.950> helps<00:01:25.429> it<00:01:25.580> to<00:01:25.849> kind<00:01:26.660> of

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
opinion that that helps it to kind of

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.190 
opinion that that helps it to kind of
blend<00:01:27.110> a<00:01:27.380> little<00:01:27.800> bit<00:01:27.950> more<00:01:28.330> but<00:01:29.330> it's<00:01:30.050> up<00:01:30.170> to

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
blend a little bit more but it's up to

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.490 
blend a little bit more but it's up to
your<00:01:30.440> personal<00:01:30.619> preference<00:01:31.369> and<00:01:31.840> I<00:01:32.840> always

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
your personal preference and I always

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.559 
your personal preference and I always
recommend<00:01:33.770> you<00:01:34.520> know<00:01:34.640> just<00:01:34.910> testing<00:01:35.360> it<00:01:35.420> out

00:01:35.559 --> 00:01:35.569 
recommend you know just testing it out

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:37.839 
recommend you know just testing it out
before<00:01:35.929> you<00:01:35.990> get<00:01:36.110> started<00:01:36.289> to<00:01:36.590> see<00:01:36.830> if<00:01:37.130> it

00:01:37.839 --> 00:01:37.849 
before you get started to see if it

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:41.230 
before you get started to see if it
gives<00:01:38.119> the<00:01:38.300> look<00:01:38.479> that<00:01:38.720> you<00:01:38.869> want<00:01:39.429> so<00:01:40.429> I'm<00:01:41.060> just

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
gives the look that you want so I'm just

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.449 
gives the look that you want so I'm just
going<00:01:41.450> to<00:01:41.539> get<00:01:41.660> started<00:01:42.020> out<00:01:42.280> sponging<00:01:43.280> those

00:01:43.449 --> 00:01:43.459 
going to get started out sponging those

00:01:43.459 --> 00:02:18.640 
going to get started out sponging those
on<00:01:43.819> all<00:01:44.240> of<00:01:44.360> my<00:01:44.509> nails

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.229 

the<00:02:19.650> colors<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.190> you're<00:02:20.430> using<00:02:20.640> are<00:02:21.030> going

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
the colors that you're using are going

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.640 
the colors that you're using are going
to<00:02:21.330> determine<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.840> number<00:02:22.050> of<00:02:22.200> coats<00:02:22.500> that

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
to determine the number of coats that

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.670 
to determine the number of coats that
you<00:02:22.890> really<00:02:23.130> need<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.340> do<00:02:23.640> and<00:02:24.530> depending<00:02:25.530> on

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
you really need to do and depending on

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.530 
you really need to do and depending on
the<00:02:25.950> number<00:02:26.220> of<00:02:26.250> coats<00:02:26.459> and<00:02:26.790> on<00:02:26.880> how<00:02:27.060> long<00:02:27.300> you

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
the number of coats and on how long you

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.259 
the number of coats and on how long you
take<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:28.140> may<00:02:28.620> have<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.520> Polish<00:02:29.849> that's<00:02:30.060> on

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
take you may have the Polish that's on

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.839 
take you may have the Polish that's on
the<00:02:30.420> sponge<00:02:30.660> kind<00:02:31.050> of<00:02:31.110> start<00:02:31.319> to<00:02:31.410> dry<00:02:31.650> out<00:02:31.849> so

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
the sponge kind of start to dry out so

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.449 
the sponge kind of start to dry out so
if<00:02:33.090> that<00:02:33.239> happens<00:02:33.690> just<00:02:34.230> move<00:02:34.590> to<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:34.950> different

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
if that happens just move to a different

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.990 
if that happens just move to a different
area<00:02:35.849> of<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.209> sponge<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:37.340> start<00:02:38.340> again<00:02:38.790> in

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
area of the sponge and start again in

00:02:39.000 --> 00:03:00.830 
area of the sponge and start again in
that<00:02:39.180> clean<00:02:39.510> area<00:02:59.120> sometimes<00:03:00.120> I<00:03:00.299> will<00:03:00.510> taper

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
that clean area sometimes I will taper

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.440 
that clean area sometimes I will taper
on<00:03:01.080> the<00:03:01.110> edges<00:03:01.590> just<00:03:01.860> to<00:03:02.250> reduce<00:03:02.849> the<00:03:03.030> cleanup

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
on the edges just to reduce the cleanup

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.890 
on the edges just to reduce the cleanup
but<00:03:04.290> it<00:03:04.410> does<00:03:04.620> make<00:03:04.950> it<00:03:05.250> a<00:03:05.430> little

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
but it does make it a little

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.170 
but it does make it a little
uncomfortable<00:03:06.900> so<00:03:07.610> sometimes<00:03:08.610> I<00:03:08.760> just<00:03:08.940> skip

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
uncomfortable so sometimes I just skip

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.500 
uncomfortable so sometimes I just skip
it

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
it

nail with a q-tip and then I'm going to
go<00:03:18.450> in<00:03:18.720> a<00:03:19.140> little<00:03:19.500> closer<00:03:19.859> with<00:03:20.400> a<00:03:20.640> small<00:03:21.030> brush

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.490 
go in a little closer with a small brush
just<00:03:22.320> like<00:03:22.440> I<00:03:22.590> do<00:03:22.650> when<00:03:23.160> water<00:03:23.459> marbling<00:03:23.910> and

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
just like I do when water marbling and

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.009 
just like I do when water marbling and
I'll<00:03:25.500> link<00:03:25.859> that<00:03:25.980> cleanup<00:03:26.519> video<00:03:27.480> where<00:03:27.989> I

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
I'll link that cleanup video where I

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.780 
I'll link that cleanup video where I
talk<00:03:28.350> a<00:03:28.380> little<00:03:28.680> bit<00:03:28.829> more<00:03:29.010> about<00:03:29.250> what<00:03:29.549> kind

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
talk a little bit more about what kind

talk a little bit more about what kind
of<00:03:29.880> brush<00:03:30.180> I<00:03:30.390> use<00:03:32.209> final<00:03:33.209> step<00:03:33.480> is<00:03:33.780> to<00:03:33.810> add<00:03:34.079> some

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
of brush I use final step is to add some

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:37.280 
of brush I use final step is to add some
topcoat<00:03:34.620> and<00:03:35.280> I'm<00:03:35.700> using<00:03:35.970> Seche<00:03:36.420> feet<00:03:36.750> like<00:03:37.140> I

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
topcoat and I'm using Seche feet like I

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.220 
topcoat and I'm using Seche feet like I
normally<00:03:37.350> do<00:03:37.859> and<00:03:38.480> you<00:03:39.480> can<00:03:39.600> see<00:03:39.780> I've<00:03:39.870> already

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
normally do and you can see I've already

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.050 
normally do and you can see I've already
done<00:03:40.410> my<00:03:40.440> pinky<00:03:41.100> and<00:03:41.280> my<00:03:41.459> ring<00:03:41.670> finger<00:03:42.030> here

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
done my pinky and my ring finger here

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.259 
done my pinky and my ring finger here
and<00:03:43.040> you<00:03:44.040> know<00:03:44.160> with<00:03:44.310> all<00:03:44.519> sponging<00:03:45.120> the

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
and you know with all sponging the

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.059 
and you know with all sponging the
topcoat<00:03:45.750> will<00:03:45.900> kind<00:03:46.139> of<00:03:46.230> smooth<00:03:46.650> out<00:03:46.859> the

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
topcoat will kind of smooth out the

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.789 
topcoat will kind of smooth out the
design<00:03:47.480> but<00:03:48.480> especially<00:03:48.840> with<00:03:49.319> this<00:03:49.530> one

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
design but especially with this one

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.210 
design but especially with this one
since<00:03:50.370> neon<00:03:50.940> colors<00:03:51.389> tend<00:03:51.750> to<00:03:51.870> dry<00:03:52.109> a<00:03:52.530> little

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
since neon colors tend to dry a little

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.509 
since neon colors tend to dry a little
bit<00:03:53.370> Matt<00:03:53.819> this<00:03:54.420> also<00:03:55.100> you<00:03:56.100> know<00:03:56.220> really

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
bit Matt this also you know really

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.059 
bit Matt this also you know really
brings<00:03:56.790> back<00:03:56.910> the<00:03:57.269> shine<00:03:57.540> and<00:03:57.959> the<00:03:58.650> vibrancy

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
brings back the shine and the vibrancy

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.879 
brings back the shine and the vibrancy
of<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.400> color<00:04:00.139> so<00:04:01.139> I'm<00:04:01.470> just<00:04:01.620> going<00:04:01.829> to

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889 
of the color so I'm just going to

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:05.080 
of the color so I'm just going to
complete<00:04:02.280> that<00:04:02.519> on<00:04:02.970> both<00:04:03.540> hands<00:04:03.989> and<00:04:04.500> then

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
complete that on both hands and then

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:26.209 
complete that on both hands and then
I'll<00:04:06.090> be<00:04:06.209> done

00:04:26.209 --> 00:04:26.219 

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:28.980 

so<00:04:27.219> there<00:04:27.939> you<00:04:28.030> have<00:04:28.090> the<00:04:28.210> finished<00:04:28.509> design

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
so there you have the finished design

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.179 
so there you have the finished design
really<00:04:29.650> pretty<00:04:30.009> simple<00:04:30.840> um<00:04:31.840> not<00:04:32.289> too<00:04:32.560> bad<00:04:32.860> for

00:04:33.179 --> 00:04:33.189 
really pretty simple um not too bad for

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:34.469 
really pretty simple um not too bad for
as<00:04:33.400> late<00:04:33.699> as<00:04:33.759> it<00:04:34.000> is

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
as late as it is

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:38.730 
as late as it is
it<00:04:34.870> is<00:04:35.069> after<00:04:36.069> midnight<00:04:36.280> right<00:04:36.550> now<00:04:36.969> and<00:04:37.740> the

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
it is after midnight right now and the

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.830 
it is after midnight right now and the
only<00:04:39.009> little<00:04:39.879> bit<00:04:40.030> of<00:04:40.120> nitpicking<00:04:40.599> I'd

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
only little bit of nitpicking I'd

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.350 
only little bit of nitpicking I'd
probably<00:04:41.110> do<00:04:41.379> is<00:04:41.620> that<00:04:41.889> the<00:04:42.069> pink<00:04:42.400> is<00:04:42.669> a<00:04:42.729> little

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
probably do is that the pink is a little

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.100 
probably do is that the pink is a little
bit<00:04:43.479> wider<00:04:43.780> on<00:04:43.930> some<00:04:44.319> nails<00:04:44.560> than<00:04:44.830> others<00:04:45.129> so<00:04:45.580> I

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
bit wider on some nails than others so I

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.200 
bit wider on some nails than others so I
hope<00:04:47.110> you<00:04:47.229> guys<00:04:47.409> enjoy<00:04:47.889> let<00:04:48.669> me<00:04:48.759> know<00:04:48.940> what<00:04:49.060> you
