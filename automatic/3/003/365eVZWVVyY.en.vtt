right<00:00:31.109> for<00:00:31.380> water<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.980> form<00:00:32.160> in<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.430> liquid

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
right for water to form in the liquid

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.250 
right for water to form in the liquid
state<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.239> gaseous<00:00:33.600> state<00:00:33.780> in<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:33.989> solid

state and the gaseous state in the solid

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.870 
state and the gaseous state in the solid
state<00:00:34.290> just<00:00:34.620> like<00:00:34.739> we<00:00:34.860> have<00:00:35.010> here<00:00:35.190> on<00:00:35.280> earth<00:00:35.370> it

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
state just like we have here on earth it

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.400 
state just like we have here on earth it
orbits<00:00:36.210> at<00:00:36.300> just<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.719> right<00:00:36.870> distance<00:00:37.079> from

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
orbits at just the right distance from

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.069 
orbits at just the right distance from
its<00:00:37.710> star<00:00:37.860> tiny<00:00:38.700> little<00:00:38.850> old-fashioned<00:00:39.840> red

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
its star tiny little old-fashioned red

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.650 
its star tiny little old-fashioned red
dwarf<00:00:40.410> star<00:00:40.710> last<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.129> million<00:00:41.460> years<00:00:41.610> oh<00:00:41.910> and

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
dwarf star last a million years oh and

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.540 
dwarf star last a million years oh and
orbits<00:00:43.200> at<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:43.440> distance<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.370> could

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
orbits at that distance that it could

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.100 
orbits at that distance that it could
remain<00:00:44.820> liquid<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.390> do<00:00:45.510> we<00:00:45.600> know<00:00:45.719> there's<00:00:45.930> life

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
remain liquid so do we know there's life

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.690 
remain liquid so do we know there's life
there<00:00:46.289> no<00:00:46.469> we<00:00:46.620> don't<00:00:46.800> but<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.039> conditions<00:00:47.460> are

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
there no we don't but the conditions are

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.940 
there no we don't but the conditions are
such<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:47.969> could<00:00:48.660> form<00:00:48.899> we<00:00:49.440> have<00:00:49.469> one

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
such that could form we have one

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.459 
such that could form we have one

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.709 
astronomer whose affinity with UC Santa
Cruz<00:00:52.500> who<00:00:52.920> said<00:00:53.190> he<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.579> pretty<00:00:54.149> close<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.510> a

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
Cruz who said he is pretty close to a

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.840 
Cruz who said he is pretty close to a
hundred<00:00:55.020> percent<00:00:55.770> certain<00:00:55.860> there<00:00:56.579> will<00:00:56.670> be

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
hundred percent certain there will be

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.119 
hundred percent certain there will be
life<00:00:57.090> on<00:00:57.360> this<00:00:57.570> planet<00:00:57.629> right<00:00:58.620> that's<00:00:58.859> pretty

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
going in right now we have an example of

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.749 
going in right now we have an example of
exactly<00:01:30.869> one<00:01:31.409> this<00:01:31.829> little<00:01:32.130> ol<00:01:32.220> planet<00:01:32.250> Earth

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
exactly one this little ol planet Earth

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.090 
exactly one this little ol planet Earth
well<00:01:33.030> turns<00:01:33.659> out<00:01:33.810> there<00:01:33.990> are<00:01:34.110> maybe<00:01:34.470> 400

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
well turns out there are maybe 400

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.679 
well turns out there are maybe 400
billion<00:01:35.340> stars<00:01:35.700> in<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.210> Milky<00:01:36.299> Way<00:01:36.659> galaxy

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.510

alone and fifty to a hundred other
billion<00:01:39.119> galaxies<00:01:39.689> right<00:01:40.070> we<00:01:41.070> found<00:01:41.340> four

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
billion galaxies right we found four

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.280 
billion galaxies right we found four
hundred<00:01:42.000> planets<00:01:42.180> now<00:01:42.540> looking<00:01:42.899> at<00:01:42.990> just<00:01:43.170> the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
hundred planets now looking at just the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.550 
hundred planets now looking at just the
very<00:01:43.409> closest<00:01:44.070> stars<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.970> our<00:01:45.750> own<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.409> this

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
very closest stars to our own so this

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.200 
very closest stars to our own so this
means<00:01:46.740> there<00:01:46.979> could<00:01:47.130> be<00:01:47.189> trillions<00:01:47.820> and

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
means there could be trillions and

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.730 
means there could be trillions and
trillions<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.630> planets<00:01:48.930> in<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.350> Milky<00:01:49.619> Way

the case for the entire planet I'm a
science<00:02:15.390> reporters<00:02:15.720> I<00:02:15.810> walk<00:02:16.110> around<00:02:16.230> on<00:02:16.530> it

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
science reporters I walk around on it

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.309 
science reporters I walk around on it
this<00:02:17.549> particular<00:02:17.760> planet<00:02:18.180> isn't<00:02:18.450> idle<00:02:18.989> walk

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
this particular planet isn't idle walk

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.050 
this particular planet isn't idle walk
with<00:02:19.680> its<00:02:19.890> star<00:02:20.159> it<00:02:20.190> goes<00:02:20.549> around<00:02:20.700> this<00:02:20.909> way

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
with its star it goes around this way

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.229 
with its star it goes around this way
always<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.720> same<00:02:21.959> face<00:02:22.440> aha<00:02:22.920> facing<00:02:23.790> that

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
always the same face aha facing that

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.589 
always the same face aha facing that
star<00:02:24.599> so<00:02:25.170> I<00:02:25.200> see<00:02:25.500> this<00:02:26.030> engines<00:02:27.030> turning<00:02:27.269> yeah

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
star so I see this engines turning yeah

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.119 
star so I see this engines turning yeah
it<00:02:27.750> doesn't<00:02:27.959> turn<00:02:28.260> so<00:02:28.500> that<00:02:28.650> means<00:02:28.830> that<00:02:28.980> there

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
it doesn't turn so that means that there

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:31.850 
it doesn't turn so that means that there
is<00:02:29.250> a<00:02:29.280> zone<00:02:29.700> right<00:02:30.480> here<00:02:30.680> where<00:02:31.680> it's<00:02:31.799> very

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
is a zone right here where it's very

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.710 
is a zone right here where it's very
temperate<00:02:32.519> climate<00:02:33.090> now<00:02:33.269> because<00:02:33.569> it's

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
temperate climate now because it's

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.809 
temperate climate now because it's
entitled<00:02:34.019> lock<00:02:34.410> that<00:02:35.069> zone<00:02:35.370> will<00:02:35.580> stay<00:02:35.790> that

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
entitled lock that zone will stay that

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.210 
entitled lock that zone will stay that
way<00:02:36.180> for<00:02:36.450> a<00:02:36.480> long<00:02:36.540> time<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.530> star<00:02:37.769> can<00:02:38.069> be

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
way for a long time and the star can be

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.100 
way for a long time and the star can be
very<00:02:38.459> old<00:02:38.760> lots<00:02:39.450> of<00:02:39.569> chance<00:02:39.840> for<00:02:40.019> revolution

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
very old lots of chance for revolution

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.280 
very old lots of chance for revolution
to<00:02:40.470> take<00:02:40.620> place<00:02:40.799> so<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:42.180> polar<00:02:42.780> bears<00:02:43.049> and<00:02:43.140> the

to take place so the polar bears and the

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.080 
to take place so the polar bears and the
Penguins<00:02:43.319> of<00:02:43.739> that<00:02:43.890> planet<00:02:44.250> could<00:02:44.489> evolve<00:02:44.849> to

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
Penguins of that planet could evolve to

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.280 
Penguins of that planet could evolve to
migrate<00:02:45.420> to<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.599> cold<00:02:45.840> side<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.230> the

tropical fish to the hot side and you

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.720 
tropical fish to the hot side and you
could<00:02:49.140> have<00:02:49.230> an<00:02:49.379> ecosystem<00:02:49.950> in<00:02:50.129> this<00:02:50.489> other

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
could have an ecosystem in this other

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.330 
could have an ecosystem in this other
Goldilocks<00:02:51.450> zone<00:02:51.599> right<00:02:52.410> here<00:02:52.440> on<00:02:52.859> the<00:02:53.010> planet
