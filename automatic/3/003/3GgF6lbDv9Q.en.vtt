tire over the front of the rim is a

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.770 
tire over the front of the rim is a
little<00:03:17.519> more<00:03:17.639> difficult<00:03:17.880> so<00:03:18.389> you<00:03:18.420> want<00:03:18.690> to

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
little more difficult so you want to

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.900 
little more difficult so you want to
spend<00:03:19.049> some<00:03:19.319> time<00:03:19.620> really<00:03:19.980> lubricating<00:03:20.760> up

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
spend some time really lubricating up

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.750 
spend some time really lubricating up
the<00:03:21.900> whole<00:03:22.079> of<00:03:22.319> the<00:03:22.410> inside<00:03:22.920> of<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.250> rim<00:03:23.489> and

the lip of the rim plus the tire as well

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:28.670 
the lip of the rim plus the tire as well
this<00:03:27.569> will<00:03:27.750> make<00:03:27.959> the<00:03:28.079> job<00:03:28.290> a<00:03:28.319> whole<00:03:28.650> lot

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
this will make the job a whole lot

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.330 
this will make the job a whole lot
easier<00:03:28.919> for<00:03:29.489> you<00:03:29.750> once<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:30.930> tire<00:03:31.169> and<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:32.160> rim

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
easier for you once the tire and the rim

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.370 
easier for you once the tire and the rim
is<00:03:32.549> all<00:03:32.669> nicely<00:03:32.940> lubricated<00:03:33.900> I<00:03:34.019> like<00:03:34.200> to
