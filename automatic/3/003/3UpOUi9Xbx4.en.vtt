00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.540 

once<00:00:44.970> you've<00:00:45.150> got<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.540> on<00:00:45.630> there<00:00:46.400> we're<00:00:47.400> now

ready<00:00:47.790> for<00:00:47.940> our<00:00:49.310> peacock<00:00:50.310> curl

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
ready for our peacock curl

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.700 
ready for our peacock curl
I<00:00:50.880> like<00:00:51.330> the<00:00:51.480> peacock<00:00:51.810> curl<00:00:52.050> because<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.560> has<00:00:52.680> a

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
I like the peacock curl because it has a

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.580 
I like the peacock curl because it has a
bit<00:00:52.950> of<00:00:52.980> an<00:00:53.160> iridescent<00:00:53.990> look<00:00:54.990> to<00:00:55.200> it<00:00:55.320> just

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
bit of an iridescent look to it just

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.580 
bit of an iridescent look to it just
like<00:00:55.740> a<00:00:55.770> beetle<00:00:56.190> does<00:00:57.290> it's<00:00:58.290> actually

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
like a beetle does it's actually

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.760 
like a beetle does it's actually
probably<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.950> most<00:00:59.100> perfect<00:00:59.610> natural

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
probably the most perfect natural

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.070 
probably the most perfect natural
imitation<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:02.010> can<00:01:02.160> find<00:01:02.780> when<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:03.840> tie

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
imitation that you can find when I tie

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.840 
imitation that you can find when I tie
it<00:01:04.110> in<00:01:04.230> three<00:01:04.530> clumps<00:01:07.370> and<00:01:08.370> now<00:01:08.610> we're<00:01:08.760> just

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
it in three clumps and now we're just

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.620 
it in three clumps and now we're just
gonna<00:01:09.060> take<00:01:09.300> those<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.900> spin<00:01:10.290> them<00:01:11.480> round<00:01:12.480> the

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
gonna take those and spin them round the

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:22.940 
gonna take those and spin them round the
shank<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:13.050> the<00:01:13.110> hook

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:42.780 

then<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.640> can<00:01:23.820> capture<00:01:24.090> them

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.219 

now<00:01:43.790> once<00:01:44.180> you've<00:01:44.270> got<00:01:44.299> those<00:01:44.570> captured<00:01:45.080> you

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
now once you've got those captured you

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.609 
now once you've got those captured you
can<00:01:45.409> pull<00:01:45.619> your<00:01:45.770> black<00:01:46.070> foam<00:01:47.260> right<00:01:48.260> over<00:01:48.530> the

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
can pull your black foam right over the

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:58.470 
can pull your black foam right over the
top<00:01:48.799> of<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:49.010> hook<00:01:51.190> just<00:01:52.190> like<00:01:52.340> so

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:58.480 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.020 

and<00:01:59.480> you<00:01:59.570> can<00:01:59.720> trim<00:02:00.020> the<00:02:00.490> head<00:02:01.490> of<00:02:01.640> the<00:02:01.730> beetle

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
and you can trim the head of the beetle

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.910 
and you can trim the head of the beetle
I<00:02:02.210> leave<00:02:02.600> just<00:02:02.900> a<00:02:02.990> little<00:02:03.230> bit<00:02:03.380> hanging<00:02:03.650> off

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
I leave just a little bit hanging off

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.760 
I leave just a little bit hanging off
the<00:02:04.910> front<00:02:04.940> just<00:02:05.630> like<00:02:05.750> so<00:02:05.990> makes<00:02:06.560> it<00:02:06.650> look

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
the front just like so makes it look

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.160 
the front just like so makes it look
like<00:02:06.800> a<00:02:06.920> head<00:02:07.420> now<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:08.570> next<00:02:08.840> thing<00:02:08.929> I'm<00:02:09.050> gonna

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
like a head now the next thing I'm gonna

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.480 
like a head now the next thing I'm gonna
do<00:02:09.350> is<00:02:09.380> I'm<00:02:09.530> gonna<00:02:09.649> take<00:02:09.890> a<00:02:09.920> piece<00:02:10.190> of<00:02:10.340> white

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
do is I'm gonna take a piece of white

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.280 
do is I'm gonna take a piece of white
foam<00:02:11.560> I'm<00:02:12.560> also<00:02:12.740> gonna<00:02:12.980> tie<00:02:13.250> that<00:02:13.280> end<00:02:14.290> right

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
foam I'm also gonna tie that end right

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.170 
foam I'm also gonna tie that end right
on<00:02:15.440> top<00:02:15.710> and<00:02:15.740> the<00:02:15.980> reason<00:02:16.280> I<00:02:16.340> put<00:02:16.550> this<00:02:16.700> piece

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
on top and the reason I put this piece

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.040 
on top and the reason I put this piece
of<00:02:17.330> white<00:02:17.480> foam<00:02:17.980> on<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.250> top<00:02:19.460> is<00:02:19.790> so<00:02:20.060> I<00:02:20.390> can<00:02:20.840> see

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
of white foam on the top is so I can see

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.420 
of white foam on the top is so I can see
it<00:02:21.790> without<00:02:22.790> that<00:02:23.120> chunk<00:02:23.420> of<00:02:23.510> white<00:02:23.720> foam<00:02:23.990> a

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
it without that chunk of white foam a

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.410 
it without that chunk of white foam a
black<00:02:25.430> fly<00:02:25.760> on<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.060> water<00:02:26.680> just<00:02:27.680> disappears

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
black fly on the water just disappears

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.199 
black fly on the water just disappears
then<00:02:29.420> you<00:02:29.510> whip<00:02:29.690> finish<00:02:30.020> right<00:02:30.260> on<00:02:30.380> top<00:02:30.620> of

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
then you whip finish right on top of

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.900 
then you whip finish right on top of
both<00:02:32.209> those<00:02:32.420> chunks<00:02:32.870> of<00:02:32.959> foam<00:02:33.730> make<00:02:34.730> sure

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
both those chunks of foam make sure

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.060 
both those chunks of foam make sure
that's<00:02:35.000> on<00:02:35.240> there<00:02:35.420> nice<00:02:35.570> and<00:02:35.630> snug<00:02:35.980> then<00:02:36.980> you

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
that's on there nice and snug then you

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.590 
that's on there nice and snug then you
could<00:02:37.190> trim<00:02:37.400> your<00:02:37.520> piece<00:02:37.790> of<00:02:37.940> white<00:02:38.060> foam<00:02:38.360> to

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
could trim your piece of white foam to

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.000 
could trim your piece of white foam to
the<00:02:38.720> desired<00:02:39.020> length<00:02:39.260> I<00:02:39.500> just<00:02:39.709> kind<00:02:39.860> of<00:02:39.890> leave

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
the desired length I just kind of leave

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.449 
the desired length I just kind of leave
a<00:02:40.070> little<00:02:40.370> tab<00:02:41.020> sticking<00:02:42.020> up<00:02:42.320> just<00:02:43.220> like<00:02:43.400> so

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
a little tab sticking up just like so

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.110 
a little tab sticking up just like so
that<00:02:44.360> gives<00:02:44.630> me<00:02:45.160> something<00:02:46.160> to<00:02:46.280> see<00:02:46.550> out<00:02:46.910> there

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
that gives me something to see out there

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.630 
that gives me something to see out there
on<00:02:47.209> the<00:02:47.300> water<00:02:47.860> if<00:02:48.860> you<00:02:49.010> didn't<00:02:49.220> put<00:02:49.370> that<00:02:49.400> on

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
on the water if you didn't put that on

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.100 
on the water if you didn't put that on
there<00:02:49.850> and<00:02:49.880> you<00:02:50.030> just<00:02:50.239> use<00:02:50.420> black<00:02:50.600> there's

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
there and you just use black there's

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.930 
there and you just use black there's
just<00:02:51.290> no<00:02:51.440> way<00:02:51.620> no<00:02:52.130> way<00:02:52.280> you'd<00:02:52.430> be<00:02:52.459> able<00:02:52.580> to<00:02:52.730> see

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
just no way no way you'd be able to see

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.850 
just no way no way you'd be able to see
it<00:02:53.260> so<00:02:54.260> that's<00:02:54.410> just<00:02:54.530> a<00:02:54.680> simple<00:02:55.010> phone<00:02:55.610> bill
