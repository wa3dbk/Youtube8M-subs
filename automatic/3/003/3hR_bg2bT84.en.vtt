00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
suction pressure gauges on your pumps

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.560 
suction pressure gauges on your pumps
because<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.220> suction<00:01:44.729> pressure<00:01:44.909> gauge<00:01:45.270> is

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
because the suction pressure gauge is

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.680 
because the suction pressure gauge is
telling<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.380> how<00:01:47.340> much<00:01:47.610> energy<00:01:47.940> is<00:01:48.420> actually

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
telling you how much energy is actually

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.920 
telling you how much energy is actually
arriving<00:01:49.470> into<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.369> pump<00:01:50.700> then<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.720> pump

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
arriving into that pump then the pump

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.140 
arriving into that pump then the pump
curve<00:01:52.170> tells<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.710> how<00:01:52.890> much<00:01:53.040> energy<00:01:53.150> should

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
curve tells you how much energy should

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.469 
curve tells you how much energy should
arrive<00:01:54.479> into<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.200> pump<00:01:55.409> at<00:01:55.650> that<00:01:55.860> duty<00:01:56.190> point

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.390 
arrive into the pump at that duty point
all<00:01:57.479> your<00:01:57.720> operators<00:01:58.229> know<00:01:58.409> this<00:01:58.619> right<00:02:01.400> all

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
all your operators know this right all

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.429 
all your operators know this right all
the<00:02:02.760> operators<00:02:03.180> know<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:03.630> so<00:02:03.810> this<00:02:04.020> is<00:02:04.260> why

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
the operators know this so this is why

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.940 
the operators know this so this is why
you're<00:02:04.770> chasing<00:02:05.310> vibrations<00:02:06.290> these<00:02:07.290> are<00:02:07.770> the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
you're chasing vibrations these are the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.750 
you're chasing vibrations these are the
reasons<00:02:08.519> you're<00:02:08.729> chasing<00:02:09.390> vibrations

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
reasons you're chasing vibrations

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.080 
reasons you're chasing vibrations
because<00:02:11.760> they<00:02:12.060> don't<00:02:12.390> know<00:02:12.689> this<00:02:13.549> all<00:02:14.549> pumps

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
because they don't know this all pumps

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.789 
because they don't know this all pumps
need<00:02:15.299> gauges<00:02:15.780> now<00:02:15.900> this<00:02:16.080> is<00:02:16.200> what<00:02:16.379> just<00:02:16.620> about

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
need gauges now this is what just about

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.220 
need gauges now this is what just about
every<00:02:17.099> pump<00:02:17.340> should<00:02:17.549> look<00:02:17.700> like<00:02:17.909> a<00:02:18.150> gauge<00:02:18.900> on

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
every pump should look like a gauge on

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.820 
every pump should look like a gauge on
the<00:02:19.349> suction<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:20.480> gauge<00:02:21.480> on<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:21.870> discharge<00:02:22.200> and

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
the suction a gauge on the discharge and

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.150 
the suction a gauge on the discharge and
it's<00:02:22.950> a<00:02:23.040> good<00:02:23.220> idea<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.580> have<00:02:23.790> your<00:02:23.909> C

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
it's a good idea to have your C

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.490 
it's a good idea to have your C
chamber<00:02:24.550> pressure<00:02:24.580> so<00:02:25.480> if<00:02:25.720> if<00:02:25.930> your<00:02:26.200> pumps

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
chamber pressure so if if your pumps

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.950 
chamber pressure so if if your pumps
look<00:02:26.680> like<00:02:26.860> that<00:02:27.040> beautiful<00:02:27.640> all<00:02:28.000> pump<00:02:28.600> should

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
look like that beautiful all pump should

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.770 
look like that beautiful all pump should
have<00:02:29.230> suction<00:02:29.920> and<00:02:30.070> discharge<00:02:30.600> gauges<00:02:31.600> and

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
have suction and discharge gauges and

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:41.950 
have suction and discharge gauges and
this<00:02:32.440> is<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:32.740> world<00:02:32.980> that<00:02:33.250> we<00:02:33.310> live<00:02:33.610> in<00:02:33.790> today
