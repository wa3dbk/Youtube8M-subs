00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
just lays right at the top so it doesn't

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.600 
just lays right at the top so it doesn't
show<00:01:14.869> too<00:01:14.900> much<00:01:15.290> skin<00:01:15.350> but<00:01:16.100> it<00:01:16.220> gives<00:01:16.430> that

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
show too much skin but it gives that

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.030 
show too much skin but it gives that
sort<00:01:16.939> of<00:01:17.060> edge<00:01:17.330> to<00:01:17.840> the<00:01:18.140> sweater<00:01:18.470> making<00:01:18.920> it

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
sort of edge to the sweater making it

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.980 
sort of edge to the sweater making it
different<00:01:19.400> from<00:01:19.909> a<00:01:19.970> lot<00:01:20.150> of<00:01:20.180> other<00:01:20.420> sweaters

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
different from a lot of other sweaters

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.440 
different from a lot of other sweaters
you<00:01:21.170> would<00:01:21.290> see<00:01:21.470> around<00:01:21.770> and<00:01:22.160> I<00:01:23.060> really<00:01:23.270> like

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
you would see around and I really like

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.000 
you would see around and I really like
the<00:01:23.600> fabric<00:01:23.840> as<00:01:24.260> well<00:01:24.440> I<00:01:24.470> think<00:01:24.650> it's<00:01:24.920> a

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
the fabric as well I think it's a

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
the fabric as well I think it's a
viscose<00:01:25.460> blend<00:01:25.880> which<00:01:26.210> is<00:01:26.420> really<00:01:26.750> great<00:01:26.990> and

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
viscose blend which is really great and

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.130 
viscose blend which is really great and
form-fitting<00:01:29.030> for<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:29.330> body<00:01:29.570> it's<00:01:29.810> stretchy

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
form-fitting for the body it's stretchy

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.320 
form-fitting for the body it's stretchy
and<00:01:30.560> soft<00:01:30.830> at<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:31.220> same<00:01:31.280> time<00:01:31.700> but<00:01:31.940> it<00:01:32.060> doesn't

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
and soft at the same time but it doesn't

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.840 
and soft at the same time but it doesn't
lose<00:01:32.480> its<00:01:32.540> shape<00:01:32.930> over<00:01:33.290> time<00:01:33.320> either<00:01:33.820> so<00:01:34.820> I

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
lose its shape over time either so I

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.540 
lose its shape over time either so I
paired<00:01:35.300> it<00:01:35.510> with<00:01:35.570> this<00:01:36.160> high-waisted<00:01:37.160> leather

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
paired it with this high-waisted leather

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.600 
paired it with this high-waisted leather
skirt<00:01:38.030> in<00:01:38.300> a<00:01:38.480> classic<00:01:39.050> a-line<00:01:39.350> shape<00:01:39.980> it<00:01:40.400> has

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
skirt in a classic a-line shape it has

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.540 
skirt in a classic a-line shape it has
quilting<00:01:41.210> detail<00:01:41.750> it's<00:01:42.410> actually<00:01:42.830> stamped

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
quilting detail it's actually stamped

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.310 
quilting detail it's actually stamped
leather<00:01:43.760> it's<00:01:44.060> stamped<00:01:44.480> quilting<00:01:44.930> so<00:01:45.200> it

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
leather it's stamped quilting so it

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.890 
leather it's stamped quilting so it
doesn't<00:01:45.650> add<00:01:45.830> as<00:01:46.070> much<00:01:46.220> volume<00:01:46.820> to<00:01:47.390> bulk<00:01:47.690> you

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
doesn't add as much volume to bulk you

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.040 
doesn't add as much volume to bulk you
up<00:01:47.930> it's<00:01:48.920> just<00:01:49.159> very<00:01:49.370> thin<00:01:49.700> leather<00:01:49.970> with<00:01:50.510> this

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050

sort<00:01:51.320> of<00:01:51.409> faux<00:01:51.980> quilting<00:01:52.580> I<00:01:52.700> would<00:01:52.880> say<00:01:53.090> and

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480 
sort of faux quilting I would say and

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.420 
sort of faux quilting I would say and
that's<00:01:54.020> definitely<00:01:54.290> what<00:01:54.650> you<00:01:54.830> want<00:01:55.190> I've

full-on quilted pieces and they add
quite<00:02:00.530> a<00:02:00.590> bit<00:02:00.680> of<00:02:00.950> bulk<00:02:01.220> and<00:02:01.550> if<00:02:02.330> that's<00:02:02.479> not

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
quite a bit of bulk and if that's not

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.149 
quite a bit of bulk and if that's not
what<00:02:02.900> you're<00:02:02.990> interested<00:02:03.229> in<00:02:03.590> and<00:02:03.770> you

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
and what's really great about them is

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.440 
and what's really great about them is
they<00:02:21.019> have<00:02:21.049> a<00:02:21.170> platform<00:02:21.500> and<00:02:22.280> that<00:02:23.030> makes<00:02:23.209> them

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
they have a platform and that makes them

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.930 
they have a platform and that makes them
a<00:02:23.480> lot<00:02:23.750> easier<00:02:24.200> to<00:02:24.410> walk<00:02:24.590> in<00:02:24.860> then<00:02:25.310> without<00:02:25.760> the

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
a lot easier to walk in then without the

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.960 
a lot easier to walk in then without the
platform<00:02:26.480> they<00:02:27.170> also<00:02:27.290> have<00:02:27.650> a<00:02:27.680> round<00:02:28.010> toe<00:02:28.280> I'm

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
platform they also have a round toe I'm

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.330 
platform they also have a round toe I'm
into<00:02:29.269> pointed<00:02:29.660> toe<00:02:29.840> shoes<00:02:30.200> as<00:02:30.500> well<00:02:30.530> and<00:02:30.950> pumps

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
but I also like a round so they each

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.059 
but I also like a round so they each
give<00:02:34.069> off<00:02:34.250> a<00:02:34.280> different<00:02:34.459> sort<00:02:35.090> of<00:02:35.180> vibe<00:02:35.450> and

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
give off a different sort of vibe and

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.589 
give off a different sort of vibe and
these<00:02:37.069> are<00:02:37.280> really<00:02:37.519> great<00:02:37.760> and<00:02:38.000> that<00:02:38.180> they're

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
these are really great and that they're

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.199 
these are really great and that they're
six<00:02:38.930> inches<00:02:39.410> but<00:02:39.769> with<00:02:39.950> with<00:02:40.340> the<00:02:40.549> platform

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
six inches but with with the platform

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.020 
six inches but with with the platform
sort<00:02:41.599> of<00:02:41.660> countered<00:02:42.170> in<00:02:42.290> there<00:02:42.530> it<00:02:43.280> takes<00:02:43.879> it

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
sort of countered in there it takes it

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.850 
sort of countered in there it takes it
down<00:02:44.180> to<00:02:44.480> about<00:02:44.690> four<00:02:44.989> inches<00:02:45.379> which<00:02:45.680> is

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
down to about four inches which is

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.220 
down to about four inches which is
highly<00:02:46.280> doable<00:02:46.430> in<00:02:46.790> my<00:02:46.940> opinion<00:02:47.329> so<00:02:47.720> these

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
highly doable in my opinion so these

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.979 
highly doable in my opinion so these
aren't<00:02:48.680> too<00:02:48.950> bad<00:02:49.160> on<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:49.579> feet<00:02:49.790> so<00:02:50.629> if<00:02:50.870> you

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989
