00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360 

I<00:00:00.110> truly<00:00:01.110> hope<00:00:01.260> that<00:00:01.319> this<00:00:01.589> expansion<00:00:02.040> is

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
I truly hope that this expansion is

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.519 
I truly hope that this expansion is
going<00:00:02.639> to<00:00:02.790> change<00:00:03.090> both<00:00:03.600> the<00:00:03.840> way<00:00:03.959> people<00:00:04.319> see

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
going to change both the way people see

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.349 
going to change both the way people see
the<00:00:04.650> museum<00:00:04.830> and<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.609> way<00:00:05.730> they<00:00:05.910> experience

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
the museum and the way they experience

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:17.240 
the museum and the way they experience
glass<00:00:06.960> I<00:00:14.750> think<00:00:15.750> this<00:00:15.929> expansion<00:00:16.379> is<00:00:16.800> really

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
glass I think this expansion is really

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.640 
glass I think this expansion is really
enabling<00:00:17.850> us<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.060> do<00:00:18.449> what<00:00:18.840> we<00:00:18.990> do<00:00:19.170> best<00:00:19.380> to

enabling us to do what we do best to
tell<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.010> world<00:00:20.130> about<00:00:20.310> glass<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:21.510> do<00:00:21.660> so

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
tell the world about glass and to do so

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.990 
tell the world about glass and to do so

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
in the most compelling manner possible

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.029 
in the most compelling manner possible
we're<00:00:24.420> driven<00:00:24.840> by<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.019> need<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.710> better

run out of room but we also knew that we

glass in ways we've never been able to

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.959 
glass in ways we've never been able to

show it before as artists have begun to
work<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.050> material<00:00:52.500> more<00:00:52.680> effectively

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
work the material more effectively

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.290 
work the material more effectively
develop<00:00:53.940> their<00:00:54.360> concepts<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.460> really<00:00:56.460> try<00:00:57.239> to

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
develop their concepts and really try to

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.810 
develop their concepts and really try to
push<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.989> boundaries<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:59.010> what<00:00:59.520> they<00:00:59.699> are

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
push the boundaries of what they are

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.869 
push the boundaries of what they are
doing<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.930> scale<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.800> objects<00:01:02.250> has<00:01:02.430> increased

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
doing the scale of objects has increased

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.670 
doing the scale of objects has increased
artists<00:01:03.480> are<00:01:03.539> working<00:01:03.570> incredibly<00:01:04.409> large

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
artists are working incredibly large

artists are working incredibly large
these<00:01:05.040> days<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.610> we<00:01:06.180> really<00:01:06.659> really<00:01:06.869> needed<00:01:07.409> a

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
these days and we really really needed a

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.500 
these days and we really really needed a
space<00:01:07.830> in<00:01:08.220> which<00:01:08.460> these<00:01:08.729> pieces<00:01:09.030> could<00:01:09.390> be

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
space in which these pieces could be

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.440 
space in which these pieces could be
accommodated<00:01:09.900> beautifully<00:01:10.860> when<00:01:11.369> we<00:01:11.520> had<00:01:12.360> our

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
accommodated beautifully when we had our

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.240 
accommodated beautifully when we had our
conversation<00:01:12.659> for<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.530> first<00:01:13.740> time<00:01:13.890> with<00:01:14.070> Tom

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
conversation for the first time with Tom

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.670 
conversation for the first time with Tom
Thomas<00:01:14.820> Pfeiffer<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:16.020> became<00:01:16.409> immediately

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
Thomas Pfeiffer it became immediately

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.370 
Thomas Pfeiffer it became immediately
clear<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.850> he<00:01:18.330> would<00:01:18.420> want<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.780> begin<00:01:19.140> with

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
clear that he would want to begin with

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.380 
clear that he would want to begin with
the<00:01:19.530> glass<00:01:19.740> with<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.220> experience<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:21.030> seeing

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
the glass with the experience of seeing

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.660 
the glass with the experience of seeing
the<00:01:21.630> glass<00:01:22.040> every<00:01:23.240> gesture<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.869> make

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
the glass every gesture that you make

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.109 
the glass every gesture that you make
here<00:01:27.320> it<00:01:28.320> needs<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.979> not<00:01:29.220> be<00:01:29.610> about<00:01:29.880> the

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
here it needs to not be about the

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.990 
here it needs to not be about the
architect<00:01:30.750> or<00:01:30.990> about<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.350> architecture<00:01:32.159> it

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
architect or about the architecture it

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.450 
architect or about the architecture it
needs<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.540> be<00:01:33.659> about<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.020> work<00:01:34.290> Tom<00:01:35.040> Pfeiffer

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
needs to be about the work Tom Pfeiffer

the project talking about architecture

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.500 
the project talking about architecture
he<00:02:07.390> was<00:02:07.540> focusing<00:02:08.110> on<00:02:08.320> the<00:02:08.740> glass<00:02:09.400> that<00:02:10.390> would

he was focusing on the glass that would

he was focusing on the glass that would
be<00:02:10.630> on<00:02:10.750> display<00:02:11.170> and<00:02:11.770> how<00:02:11.920> how<00:02:12.460> best<00:02:12.820> to<00:02:13.060> see

be on display and how how best to see
that<00:02:13.300> glass<00:02:13.720> first<00:02:14.410> thing<00:02:14.710> we<00:02:14.860> did<00:02:15.300> was<00:02:16.300> take<00:02:16.660> a

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
that glass first thing we did was take a

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.520 
that glass first thing we did was take a
glass<00:02:17.380> object<00:02:18.070> out<00:02:18.250> into<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:18.610> sunshine<00:02:18.850> and

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
glass object out into the sunshine and

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.610 
glass object out into the sunshine and
we<00:02:20.530> looked<00:02:20.860> at<00:02:21.040> it<00:02:21.070> and<00:02:21.490> it<00:02:21.670> just<00:02:22.620> exploded

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
we looked at it and it just exploded

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.040 
we looked at it and it just exploded
with<00:02:23.830> light<00:02:24.220> that<00:02:24.940> was<00:02:25.060> a<00:02:25.090> kind<00:02:25.390> of<00:02:25.480> wonderful

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
with light that was a kind of wonderful

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.620 
with light that was a kind of wonderful
moment<00:02:26.470> for<00:02:26.500> us<00:02:26.680> because<00:02:27.070> we<00:02:27.400> discovered<00:02:28.000> that

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
moment for us because we discovered that

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.230 
moment for us because we discovered that
glass<00:02:28.990> loves<00:02:29.500> light<00:02:29.860> so<00:02:30.760> we<00:02:30.880> knew<00:02:31.000> we<00:02:31.120> wanted

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
glass loves light so we knew we wanted

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.910 
glass loves light so we knew we wanted
to<00:02:31.480> start<00:02:31.750> with<00:02:31.840> daylight<00:02:32.290> we<00:02:32.470> knew<00:02:32.620> we<00:02:32.770> wanted

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
to start with daylight we knew we wanted

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.800 
to start with daylight we knew we wanted
the<00:02:33.130> contemporary<00:02:33.550> gallery<00:02:33.880> to<00:02:34.180> utilize

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
the contemporary gallery to utilize

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.570 
the contemporary gallery to utilize
daylight<00:02:35.230> and<00:02:35.470> because<00:02:35.980> glass<00:02:36.280> isn't

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
daylight and because glass isn't

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.490 
daylight and because glass isn't
light-sensitive<00:02:37.420> we<00:02:37.720> have<00:02:37.930> a<00:02:37.960> wonderful

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
light-sensitive we have a wonderful

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.290 
light-sensitive we have a wonderful
opportunity<00:02:38.740> here<00:02:39.430> to<00:02:39.880> create<00:02:40.150> a

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
opportunity here to create a

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.210 
opportunity here to create a
contemporary<00:02:41.020> gallery<00:02:41.410> that<00:02:41.650> is<00:02:41.770> entirely

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
contemporary gallery that is entirely

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.700 
contemporary gallery that is entirely
top<00:02:42.760> lit<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.540> entire<00:02:43.900> roof<00:02:44.260> of<00:02:44.590> the

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
top lit the entire roof of the

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.340 
top lit the entire roof of the
contemporary<00:02:45.130> gallery<00:02:45.580> is<00:02:45.820> a<00:02:45.850> skylight<00:02:46.540> you

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
contemporary gallery is a skylight you

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.380 
contemporary gallery is a skylight you
know<00:02:47.500> when<00:02:47.650> you're<00:02:47.770> working<00:02:47.890> almost<00:02:48.390> museums

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
know when you're working almost museums

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.110 
know when you're working almost museums
we<00:02:49.810> have<00:02:49.990> to<00:02:50.140> keep<00:02:50.380> the<00:02:51.040> light<00:02:51.250> levels<00:02:51.640> down<00:02:51.880> so

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
we have to keep the light levels down so

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.500 
we have to keep the light levels down so
we<00:02:52.270> protect<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:52.900> works<00:02:53.110> here<00:02:54.010> at<00:02:54.130> Corning<00:02:54.580> we

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
we protect the works here at Corning we

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.770 
we protect the works here at Corning we
were<00:02:55.720> able<00:02:56.200> to<00:02:56.470> push<00:02:57.340> an<00:02:57.640> enormous<00:02:58.450> amount<00:02:58.720> of

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
were able to push an enormous amount of

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.050 
were able to push an enormous amount of
daylight<00:02:59.230> from<00:03:00.130> the<00:03:00.250> ceiling<00:03:00.700> and<00:03:00.790> so<00:03:00.940> we

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
daylight from the ceiling and so we

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.380 
daylight from the ceiling and so we
developed<00:03:01.480> a<00:03:01.630> special<00:03:03.000> skylight<00:03:04.000> and<00:03:04.270> a

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
developed a special skylight and a

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.770 
developed a special skylight and a
special<00:03:05.050> ceiling<00:03:05.620> here<00:03:06.040> that<00:03:07.030> will<00:03:07.270> push<00:03:07.570> the

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
special ceiling here that will push the

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.470 
special ceiling here that will push the
light<00:03:07.990> directly<00:03:08.560> down<00:03:09.190> to<00:03:09.220> the<00:03:09.580> works<00:03:09.790> it's

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
light directly down to the works it's

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.930 
light directly down to the works it's
it's<00:03:10.750> an<00:03:10.900> engineered<00:03:11.590> experience<00:03:12.459> that's

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
it's an engineered experience that's

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.449 
it's an engineered experience that's
allowed<00:03:13.330> to<00:03:13.600> change<00:03:13.989> over<00:03:14.830> the<00:03:14.950> course<00:03:15.160> of<00:03:15.310> the

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
allowed to change over the course of the

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:15.870 
allowed to change over the course of the
day

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
day

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.560 
day
I<00:03:15.910> love<00:03:16.630> the<00:03:16.930> idea<00:03:17.380> of<00:03:17.880> looking<00:03:18.880> at<00:03:19.030> sculpture

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
I love the idea of looking at sculpture

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.199 
I love the idea of looking at sculpture
and<00:03:19.780> having<00:03:20.200> a<00:03:20.350> cloud<00:03:20.800> pass<00:03:21.190> over<00:03:21.489> the<00:03:21.610> Sun<00:03:21.850> and

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
and having a cloud pass over the Sun and

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.690 
and having a cloud pass over the Sun and
to<00:03:22.239> see<00:03:22.660> that<00:03:22.870> difference<00:03:23.380> as<00:03:24.160> that<00:03:24.370> shadow

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
to see that difference as that shadow

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.140 
to see that difference as that shadow
passes<00:03:25.330> by<00:03:25.480> it's<00:03:25.810> so<00:03:26.110> dynamic<00:03:26.410> the<00:03:27.400> character

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
passes by it's so dynamic the character

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.000 
passes by it's so dynamic the character
of<00:03:28.300> that<00:03:28.330> room<00:03:28.750> and<00:03:28.989> the<00:03:29.140> character<00:03:29.769> of<00:03:29.860> these

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
of that room and the character of these

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.729 
of that room and the character of these
works<00:03:30.340> will<00:03:31.209> constantly<00:03:31.930> change<00:03:32.080> and<00:03:32.590> it<00:03:32.680> will

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
works will constantly change and it will

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.360 
works will constantly change and it will
bring<00:03:33.040> nature<00:03:33.480> into<00:03:34.480> the<00:03:34.870> experience<00:03:35.500> class

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
bring nature into the experience class

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.100 
bring nature into the experience class
has<00:03:36.610> never<00:03:36.820> been<00:03:37.000> displayed<00:03:37.420> this<00:03:37.660> way<00:03:37.720> before

has never been displayed this way before

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.960 
has never been displayed this way before
and<00:03:38.590> we<00:03:38.739> are<00:03:38.860> really<00:03:39.190> looking<00:03:39.340> forward<00:03:39.820> to

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
let the artwork come forward as much as

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.240 
let the artwork come forward as much as
possible<00:04:52.610> because<00:04:53.330> you<00:04:53.690> know<00:04:53.810> when<00:04:53.990> you<00:04:54.250> stand

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
possible because you know when you stand

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.100 
possible because you know when you stand
in<00:04:55.430> front<00:04:55.490> of<00:04:55.820> a<00:04:55.910> work<00:04:56.120> and<00:04:56.360> you<00:04:56.480> make<00:04:56.840> that

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
in front of a work and you make that

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.510 
in front of a work and you make that
connection<00:04:58.330> without<00:04:59.330> distractions<00:05:00.080> that<00:05:00.520> is

connection without distractions that is

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.900 
connection without distractions that is
a<00:05:01.550> poetic<00:05:01.940> and<00:05:02.570> memorable<00:05:03.470> moment<00:05:03.860> I<00:05:04.100> think

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
a poetic and memorable moment I think

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.060 
a poetic and memorable moment I think
what's<00:05:05.120> most<00:05:05.510> exciting<00:05:05.750> is<00:05:06.380> the<00:05:06.710> sense<00:05:06.950> of

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
what's most exciting is the sense of

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.159 
what's most exciting is the sense of
space<00:05:07.430> that<00:05:07.729> we'll<00:05:07.910> have<00:05:08.150> it<00:05:08.540> will<00:05:08.660> be<00:05:08.780> a<00:05:08.810> space

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
space that we'll have it will be a space

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:12.219 
space that we'll have it will be a space

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:42.210 
and that sense of place I think of it as

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.370 
and that sense of place I think of it as
a<00:06:42.240> cathedral<00:06:42.960> for<00:06:43.590> hot<00:06:43.740> glass<00:06:44.010> with<00:06:44.880> the

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:45.380 
a cathedral for hot glass with the

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.850 
a cathedral for hot glass with the
molten<00:06:46.380> glass<00:06:46.410> sort<00:06:47.160> of<00:06:47.220> on<00:06:47.430> center<00:06:47.940> so

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:48.860 
molten glass sort of on center so

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:52.250 
molten glass sort of on center so
spiritually<00:06:49.860> the<00:06:50.400> idea<00:06:50.790> that<00:06:51.090> that<00:06:51.300> is<00:06:51.360> the

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:52.260 
spiritually the idea that that is the

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.230 
spiritually the idea that that is the
the<00:06:52.650> point<00:06:52.950> that<00:06:53.070> you're<00:06:53.340> being<00:06:53.520> directed<00:06:54.030> to

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 
the point that you're being directed to

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.260 
the point that you're being directed to
is<00:06:54.480> you<00:06:54.650> arrive<00:06:55.650> at<00:06:55.860> this<00:06:56.040> museum<00:06:56.520> and<00:06:56.730> come<00:06:57.000> to

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 
this this this material I would argue

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.070 
this this this material I would argue
this<00:07:00.390> magic<00:07:00.900> material<00:07:01.880> that<00:07:02.880> is<00:07:03.330> the<00:07:03.810> source

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 
this magic material that is the source

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.800 
this magic material that is the source
of<00:07:04.290> so<00:07:04.500> much<00:07:04.680> creative<00:07:05.130> and<00:07:05.610> artistic<00:07:06.120> and

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:06.810 
of so much creative and artistic and

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:11.270 
of so much creative and artistic and
technical<00:07:08.060> creativity<00:07:09.410> is<00:07:10.410> just<00:07:10.740> such<00:07:11.250> a

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 
technical creativity is just such a

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.910 
technical creativity is just such a
compelling<00:07:11.850> idea<00:07:12.230> so<00:07:13.230> I<00:07:13.260> think<00:07:13.440> it's<00:07:13.710> going<00:07:13.890> to

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:13.920 
compelling idea so I think it's going to

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.250 
compelling idea so I think it's going to
be<00:07:14.040> tremendously<00:07:14.640> exciting<00:07:15.270> and<00:07:15.420> I<00:07:15.990> think

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:16.260 
be tremendously exciting and I think

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:17.570 
be tremendously exciting and I think
we're<00:07:16.380> gonna<00:07:16.470> set<00:07:16.740> a<00:07:16.770> standard<00:07:17.100> that's<00:07:17.430> going

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:17.580 
we're gonna set a standard that's going

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.460 
we're gonna set a standard that's going
to<00:07:17.640> be<00:07:17.760> hard<00:07:18.000> to<00:07:18.060> beat<00:07:18.360> at<00:07:18.540> any<00:07:18.720> other<00:07:18.930> museum

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:19.470 
to be hard to beat at any other museum

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:25.080 
to be hard to beat at any other museum
around<00:07:19.740> the<00:07:19.800> world
