from the eleventh fret and then the
twelfth<00:00:52.940> and<00:00:53.090> in<00:00:53.180> fact<00:00:53.300> of<00:00:53.480> the<00:00:53.540> game

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.980 

so<00:00:57.640> just<00:00:57.940> like<00:00:58.090> we<00:00:58.240> did<00:00:58.360> with<00:00:58.450> the<00:00:58.510> E<00:00:58.600> string

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:58.990 
so just like we did with the E string

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.630 
so just like we did with the E string
you<00:00:59.470> just<00:00:59.620> move<00:00:59.830> on<00:00:59.890> to<00:01:00.010> the<00:01:00.100> B<00:01:00.220> string<00:01:00.490> and

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
you just move on to the B string and

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
you just move on to the B string and
same<00:01:00.850> pattern<00:01:01.180> again<00:01:01.420> open<00:01:07.050> low<00:01:08.050> 12<00:01:09.450> then<00:01:10.450> g

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
same pattern again open low 12 then g

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:27.870 
same pattern again open low 12 then g
string<00:01:25.890> just<00:01:26.890> like<00:01:27.070> that<00:01:27.220> in<00:01:27.400> two<00:01:27.610> minutes

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
string just like that in two minutes

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.250 
string just like that in two minutes
you've<00:01:28.030> learned<00:01:28.240> five<00:01:28.570> major<00:01:28.930> scales

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
you've learned five major scales

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.570 
you've learned five major scales
although<00:01:29.619> hopefully<00:01:29.830> I've<00:01:30.040> got<00:01:30.070> time<00:01:30.310> to<00:01:30.460> say

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
although hopefully I've got time to say

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.250 
although hopefully I've got time to say
this<00:01:30.610> don't<00:01:31.150> just<00:01:31.270> practice<00:01:31.690> going<00:01:31.990> up<00:01:32.140> and

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 
this don't just practice going up and

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.790 
this don't just practice going up and
down<00:01:33.570> it's<00:01:34.570> boring<00:01:34.960> even<00:01:35.410> though<00:01:35.500> it<00:01:35.590> sounds

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
down it's boring even though it sounds

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.590 
down it's boring even though it sounds
quite<00:01:35.920> nice<00:01:36.100> use<00:01:36.550> open<00:01:36.940> strings<00:01:37.180> in<00:01:37.330> there<00:01:37.479> and

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
quite nice use open strings in there and

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:44.999 
quite nice use open strings in there and
get<00:01:37.690> a<00:01:37.720> pedal<00:01:38.020> it<00:01:38.140> going<00:01:43.680> something<00:01:44.680> like<00:01:44.830> that

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
get a pedal it going something like that

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.400 
get a pedal it going something like that
something<00:01:45.310> like<00:01:45.460> quicken<00:01:45.910> and<00:01:46.150> then<00:01:46.420> expanded

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
something like quicken and then expanded

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.560 
something like quicken and then expanded
and<00:01:47.560> use<00:01:47.680> other<00:01:47.860> strings<00:01:51.420> something<00:01:52.420> like

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
and use other strings something like

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.120 
and use other strings something like
that<00:01:52.750> and<00:01:52.930> just<00:01:53.050> jump<00:01:53.320> around<00:01:53.560> a<00:01:53.650> bit<00:01:53.800> in<00:01:53.830> and

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
that and just jump around a bit in and

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.320 
that and just jump around a bit in and
have<00:01:54.310> fun<00:01:54.520> with<00:01:54.700> it<00:01:54.850> and<00:01:54.970> so<00:01:55.090> there<00:01:55.210> you<00:01:55.270> are

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
have fun with it and so there you are

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.009 
have fun with it and so there you are
five<00:01:55.780> major<00:01:56.080> scales<00:01:56.470> two<00:01:56.860> minutes
