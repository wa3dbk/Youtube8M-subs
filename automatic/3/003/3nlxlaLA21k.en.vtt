00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
you can move the ball so the ball is

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.000 
you can move the ball so the ball is
actually<00:00:50.879> here<00:00:51.390> but<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.350> can<00:00:52.559> here<00:00:52.860> let<00:00:52.980> me

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
actually here but you can here let me

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.069 
actually here but you can here let me
show<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.520> let<00:00:54.030> me<00:00:54.149> zoom<00:00:54.329> in<00:00:54.510> on<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.840> for

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.080 
show you that let me zoom in on that for
you<00:00:57.050> so<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.379> on<00:00:58.559> both<00:00:58.890> sides<00:00:58.949> so<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.609> can<00:00:59.820> flip

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
you so it is on both sides so I can flip

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.110 
you so it is on both sides so I can flip
it<00:01:00.149> over<00:01:00.390> now<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:01.070> the<00:01:02.070> maze<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.699> ball<00:01:02.910> can

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
it over now and the maze the ball can

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.609 
it over now and the maze the ball can
drop<00:01:03.359> through<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.719> come<00:01:03.989> through<00:01:04.170> this<00:01:04.350> side

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
drop through and come through this side

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.940 
drop through and come through this side
so<00:01:05.030> looks<00:01:06.030> interesting<00:01:06.720> let's<00:01:07.380> see<00:01:07.590> if<00:01:07.680> we<00:01:07.770> can

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
so looks interesting let's see if we can

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.070 
so looks interesting let's see if we can
move<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.090> around<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.600> get<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.470> do<00:01:10.590> that

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
move it around and get it to do that

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.429 
move it around and get it to do that
no<00:01:13.080> well<00:01:13.890> let's<00:01:14.310> do<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.549> again

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
no well let's do that again

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:18.440 
no well let's do that again

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.660 
connect to the back let's see okay I see
just<00:02:36.090> kind<00:02:36.270> of<00:02:36.390> presses<00:02:37.200> in<00:02:37.380> and<00:02:37.620> locks<00:02:38.400> into

just kind of presses in and locks into
place<00:02:40.610> pretty<00:02:41.610> good<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:42.270> then<00:02:43.020> this<00:02:43.560> is<00:02:43.770> some

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
place pretty good and then this is some

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.030 
place pretty good and then this is some
kind<00:02:44.790> of<00:02:44.910> top<00:02:45.330> piece<00:02:46.080> that<00:02:46.320> I'm<00:02:46.440> gonna<00:02:46.620> need<00:02:46.830> so

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
way they show the two holes in the front

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.760 
way they show the two holes in the front
and<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:02.700> two<00:03:02.910> holes<00:03:03.180> locking<00:03:04.140> together<00:03:04.560> the

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
and the two holes locking together the

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.040 
and the two holes locking together the
two<00:03:04.920> pins<00:03:05.220> in<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.550> back<00:03:05.730> that<00:03:06.630> locked
