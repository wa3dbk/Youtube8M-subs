00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.380
 and 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.880
 what wave brothers friends comrades and 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.400
 you open their great virtual carnal 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.710
 techno and today I bring you a new 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:39.000
 tutorial is how to make a partition 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.400
 in your windows either xp view or 7 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.620
 well these partitions are for what 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.690
 you want to either save 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.330
 information or to have another system 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.850
 operative good this is very easy to 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.430
 do we do it with a program called 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.720
 mini tool partition wizard as an edition 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.270
 in its version 5.2 good friends and you 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.940
 will ask where can I download this 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.979
 program do not worry brothers the 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.290
 program link will be in the 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.509
 description of the video a link is from 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.509
 mediafire and the other one is from radic shared 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:14.759
 choose the one you like most download it 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:18.860
 and they put it on the desk of ay and it's more 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:18.860
 easy to do all the procedures 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:23.910
 Once downloaded them stay 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.610
 rar file what we will do is 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.850
 unzip it right click and extract 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.549
 here 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.369
 they will have the installer what we will do 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:36.710
 is to install the program quelli right and 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:41.590
 run as administrator for those who 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.590
 has windows xp just give two clicks 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.360
 What we will do here is to give you success 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.799
 We accept the license agreement and 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.799
 then we give to next 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:03.100
 we return to success 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.100
 we return to next 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:12.330
 we return to next 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.700
 we return to next 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.650
 and here we just give you to install and 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.650
 we wait for the program to be installed 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:27.380
 now we only give finish now what 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.660
 what we will do is open the program 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.620
 they open it from the shortcut 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:39.090
 I will open it from my start menu 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:41.650
 and this warning will appear 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.140
 saying if they want to update the 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:51.830
 program you give him that no 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:54.410
 and they will have this program what 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:57.290
 we will do is select the local disk 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.240
 that has more capacity in my case is the 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.820
 local disk once you 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:05.290
 we select we give you a clip where 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.290
 says move resists 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:16.080
 what we will do here is something very simple 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.960
 we just have to drag this line 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.360
 of time until they want to go down 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.970
 says how many megabytes are you occupying and 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.310
 how many I spent is the only thing left 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.320
 that you should not pass is where you are 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.590
 yellow since those are the archives 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.230
 what is your current windows 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.200
 recommendation will not go to the yellow side 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.050
 understood friends 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.319
 you choose how many gigabytes you want 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.599
 in my case I just want 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:46.790
 10.22 gigabytes once we have already 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:51.220
 chosen the amount of gigabytes that 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.220
 we want what we will do is give in ok 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.400
 As you can see here we already have our 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.650
 partition with the amount we choose 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.530
 of gigabytes now what we will do is 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.780
 something very simple is to create it for that 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:08.700
 we go up and give it a 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.700
 click where it says create you 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.959
 where it says partition label us 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:24.360
 we put the name of our partition 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:29.510
 in my case I will put my name where 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:32.810
 says file system we leave it in ntfs 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.449
 where it says believe you've left it on 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.900
 logic 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:40.539
 where laser driver says we choose the 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:44.409
 letter for our partition in my case 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:47.969
 I'll leave it in f where it says clusters and 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:50.849
 we will leave it in de paul 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:54.659
 here will be the gigabytes of our 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:58.129
 partition in my case are 10.29 gigabytes 

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:58.129
 and now we give in ok 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.700
 we will select our partition that 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.990
 we did in my case is the f 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.990
 we give it where it says 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.300
 we'll get this little window saying yes 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.030
 we want to make our partition what 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.460
 we will do is give you where it says if you 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.680
 another window will come out saying that the 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.139
 team is going to restart to create the 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.690
 partition you give it where it says 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.909
 restart and restart the computer 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.250
 when I turn on the computer again 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:31.319
 program will automatically start at 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.120
 create the partition this takes 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:35.909
 depending on the processor of your system 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.490
 once the partition made the team 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:41.069
 will light and they will already have their partition with 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.530
 the amount of gigabytes that they put 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:46.229
 I do not do this because I'm recording with 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:50.569
 he sings yes to study 7 and I'll get a 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:50.569
 error but you guys do it 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:57.870
 and that's all friends if they liked the 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.030
 video put thumb up comment the

 dismissal friends take care very well I am 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:16.220
 and I will continue to be virtual technos and up 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:16.220
 my next tutorial goodbye
