students develop into greater players
faster<00:00:19.439> more<00:00:19.680> effectively<00:00:20.480> I'm<00:00:21.480> also<00:00:21.779> going

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
faster more effectively I'm also going

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.870 
faster more effectively I'm also going

that you'd like to make a lot more money
teaching<00:00:36.780> guitar<00:00:37.050> than<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.010> are<00:00:38.160> right<00:00:38.190> now

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
teaching guitar than you are right now

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.680 
teaching guitar than you are right now
fortunately<00:00:40.500> all<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.670> those<00:00:41.879> goals<00:00:42.300> are

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
fortunately all of those goals are

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.660 
fortunately all of those goals are
possible<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.500> not<00:00:43.590> only<00:00:43.770> are<00:00:43.890> they<00:00:44.100> possible

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
possible and not only are they possible

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.150 
possible and not only are they possible
but<00:00:45.300> it's<00:00:45.420> possible<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.140> achieve<00:00:46.230> all<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.710> them

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
but it's possible to achieve all of them

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.000 
but it's possible to achieve all of them
at<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.789> same<00:00:47.820> time<00:00:48.329> with<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.989> same<00:00:49.289> set<00:00:49.770> of

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
at the same time with the same set of

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.119 
at the same time with the same set of
strategies<00:00:51.800> so<00:00:52.800> if<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.219> think<00:00:53.489> about

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
strategies so if you think about

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.000 
strategies so if you think about
becoming<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.309> more<00:00:56.489> effective<00:00:56.730> teacher<00:00:57.120> or

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
becoming a more effective teacher or

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.209 
becoming a more effective teacher or
inspiring<00:00:59.010> students<00:00:59.579> more<00:00:59.820> or<00:01:00.800> making<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:02.039> lot

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
inspiring students more or making a lot

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.429 
inspiring students more or making a lot
more<00:01:02.250> money<00:01:02.670> those<00:01:03.210> might<00:01:03.449> seem<00:01:03.809> like<00:01:03.840> they're

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
more money those might seem like they're

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.109 
more money those might seem like they're
related<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:04.920> course<00:01:04.949> but<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.670> there<00:01:06.030> are

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
related of course but that there are

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.240 
related of course but that there are
that<00:01:06.360> they're<00:01:06.510> different<00:01:06.780> goals<00:01:07.680> there<00:01:08.189> are

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
that they're different goals there are

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.490 
that they're different goals there are
three<00:01:08.460> distinct<00:01:08.850> goals<00:01:09.229> but<00:01:10.229> they're<00:01:10.380> really

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
three distinct goals but they're really

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.230 
three distinct goals but they're really
not<00:01:10.680> they<00:01:11.010> can<00:01:11.100> all<00:01:11.340> be<00:01:11.369> integrated<00:01:12.119> together

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
not they can all be integrated together

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.410 
not they can all be integrated together
and<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:13.080> starts<00:01:13.560> with<00:01:13.850> your<00:01:14.850> first<00:01:15.119> your

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
and it starts with your first your

teaching skills your teaching abilities

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.170 
teaching skills your teaching abilities
second<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.439> probably<00:01:19.799> more<00:01:20.130> importantly<00:01:20.189> it

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
second and probably more importantly it

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.380 
second and probably more importantly it
goes<00:01:21.750> into<00:01:22.229> your<00:01:22.259> ability<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.400> inspire<00:01:23.790> and

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
goes into your ability to inspire and

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.399 
goes into your ability to inspire and
motivate<00:01:25.939> students<00:01:26.939> over<00:01:27.150> long<00:01:27.509> periods<00:01:28.290> of
