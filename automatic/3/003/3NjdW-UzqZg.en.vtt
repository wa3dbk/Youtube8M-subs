 for you to do at home 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:14.639
 Our proposal today is from the Arab kitchen 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.609
 so let's first put the 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.730
 our little song 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:22.590
 today we go from another 36 good song 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.260
 combines with good food, let's make a 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.140
 board that salad 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.019
 the area has in Syria also where the base 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.920
 it's so we 're going to use four 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.559
 packet of parsley half cup and wheat 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.780
 For quibe already hydrated you hydrate 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.489
 during the 10 minutes put water on top 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.270
 one pinch salt ten minutes 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:50.640
 hydrated half a white onion a password 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:54.059
 of fresh mint 3 cinnamon and 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.629
 pepper and salt and the juice of two 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.020
 demons to stay cool 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.350
 parsley 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.520
 a lot of people put the lettuce tab 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.600
 cucumber 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.580
 but the most common one in Syria is to use 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.650
 based only so you can see 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.409
 that's enough just so let's go there 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.659
 so we cut here 3 tomatoes without 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.880
 seeds mint 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:22.080
 All the freshness here is ours. 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.850
 pride first and the onion I go 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.799
 teach a basket for you to not 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.290
 get a very strong taste of onion and 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:32.100
 you will notice that it will make a difference 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.860
 or for a little cinnamon one 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.869
 little pepper and pepper 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.979
 I'm going to mess with your fingers. 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:43.049
 then this cinnamon this pepper will take away 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.270
 that strong taste that stays onion 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.880
 raw material at work to help the 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.310
 This is where I'm going to put a little bit of 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.340

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:04.210

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.670

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:11.080

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:15.700

 We are not going to incorporate here our 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.950
 work then move well so that everyone 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:35.440
 the ingredients here mix and only have the 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.090
 taste and look how it turned out this is 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.100
 your side is actually pretty refreshing 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.530

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.470
 Olive oil taste 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:48.040
 here is our first plate of 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:52.030
 problem is the work if we are going to do 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.910
 Now we work it juice ingredients 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.280
 two lemons two eggplants I go 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.830
 burn in the fire is very nice that goes 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.400
 stay that taste of smoked salvia 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:06.580
 oil and Ryota're rene is nothing more 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.400
 that a paste of sesame the sesame 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.350
 burned with sesame oil this 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.780
 burned society and she will give that 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.970
 smoked taste that has become a 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.080
 wonder our briefcase it will be fine 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:22.570
 roasted the same shell but will preserve 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.970
 the interior of the eggplant and it 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.400
 with this aspect the film pushed the 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.959
 What I'm going to do now, I'm going to take it all away. 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.370
 This shell will not peel me. 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.670
 Interest me interested here. 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:37.040
 interior of the legend then look 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.720
 she freaked out but inside she gave 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.299
 a pass on the sale 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.909
 in this process it is possible to 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:46.220
 do in the oven too but I think 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:48.829
 You're burning on the stove. 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.329
 I like smoked smoked meat that is 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:52.640
 more nice is good 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:55.310
 I then took the whole eggplant shell 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.400
 that shell that was burned and I'm going to 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.209

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.739

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:46.330
