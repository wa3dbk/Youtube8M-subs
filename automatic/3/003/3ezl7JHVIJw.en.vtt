00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.550
 hello to all I am super happy to 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.490
 find you today for a 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:15.400
 video tutorials words on them 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.380
 eyebrows then very important I say 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.600
 before we start the video for 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.880
 those who arrive on this video without 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.710
 know my channel or know me 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.630
 know that I am Belgian and that 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.599
 belgium many of us say 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.250
 eyebrow and no eyebrows less current 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:31.779
 not that I deliberately forget the 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.260
 she because jenson a new fashion 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:37.600
 or what and second formality a little 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.670
 little annoying video but it takes 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.740
 that I say of course we are not here 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.300
 to discuss the shape of my eyebrow 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.610
 who they like to do they like 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.380
 not because these are my sources there is 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.090
 so if I do them as I do 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.650
 is that I like them what 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.660
 many villages tour one is beautiful and 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.880
 well here for that I give and small 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.650
 tips to those who want 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.970
 that's where they do not want it and who 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.540
 are bored watching the video when 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.940
 even this being said let's start then we 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.170
 started with the hair removal part so 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.420
 personally I always 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.780
 to have my eyebrows shaved 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.310
 luck 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.930
 being young I was more or less 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.730
 reasonable and so I will not be shaved 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.010
 too much then we'll start with 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.320
 take three landmarks on his 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.810
 eyebrow take a utensil a brush 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.090
 a batten everything you find that he 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.159
 heals we are relatively fine so but 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.940
 in this case I took a brush and 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.150
 I place it from the bridge of the nose to the corner of 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.640
 the eye 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.400
 to the eyebrows we will depilate everything 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.810
 who's on the other side of the brush or 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.940
 it's really the first point of 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.860
 landmark not to be neglected for not 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.990
 too the tweezers and eyebrow have 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.680
 discarded after according to the morphology 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.090
 of each 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.220
 we can cheat so if you have them 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.960
 eyes a little too neighborhood cheat of a 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.880
 millimeter or so and we do not epilate them 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.650
 not really on the edge of the eyes, but that's it 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.080
 roughly followed the first benchmark 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.020
 second benchmarks the same we talk about the 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.460
 of the nose how the edge of anarchy 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.829
 yes I said stop one and now 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.530
 we start from the edge of the nostril and then 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:04.649
 keeping a lot of good ones either we go to 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.490
 center of the ward and there by connecting 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.860
 these two points 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.310
 we will get our third benchmarks 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.930
 who is going to be who or who may already have 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.299
 the hollower side of your eyebrow 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.190
 so there you will create your angle or 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:19.170
 your rounding you go stacks and everything 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.849
 what is in excess of all that it exceeds 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.120
 that little hairs that are outside 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:26.040
 your source is really hairy by 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.620
 hair carefully you will try 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.260
 to create but this round that is going to be 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.660
 more pronounced where your brush has 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.700
 landed and third and last point of 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.590
 landmark we take the nostril the corner 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.480
 external eye have slipped points 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.000
 and we pile everything that goes beyond 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.160
 brush and so we do not shorten 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.650
 too much of his eyebrow so we often say we 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.849
 is stack is not above the eyebrow I 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.530
 do not know why I never knew 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.630
 why but that's what I say 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.700
 daily epilates me the top of the 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.230
 dowser too and it does not bother me 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.650
 I did not say March I would not have 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.019
 to make 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.700
 no and I prefer that because the 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.090
 work are so much more 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.150
 clear 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:06.560
 so after waxing my eyebrow 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.690
 I add a step that liked cutting 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.760
 yes so I like small scissors weapons 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.170
 small scissors found everywhere 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.250
 do not go to florist 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.720
 because I think we will not have 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.280
 using a little brush I'm going 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.620
 wind up all the hair so they 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.970
 go beyond the shape of the eyebrow and I 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.500
 do not put anything that cut 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.660
 the shape of the eyebrow not the 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.000
 everything does not do that but really just the 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.549
 spikes and for the head of the eyebrow I 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.680
 wood up and I cut a 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:33.599
 way a little sharper for really 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.730
 that the hairs only make the height of 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.500
 the head of the eyebrow that I want to have 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.540
 and it gives me one more time to have 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.010
 a job he cleaner and more 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.959
 clean if you're not comfortable 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.690
 with this step could cut small to 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.760
 small did not cut at once 1 8 cm 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.690
 here we come to the last step that 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.250
 is the filling the drawing 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.290
 eyebrow it's like you feel it 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.790
 I say why not another because 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.100
 you can simply fill 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.990
 slightly troops you have without 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.520
 to redesign your site 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.020
 depends if you have too much supported you 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.760
 want to fill if you did it more 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.530
 natural or more sophisticated or more 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.570
 plot then I propose you three 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.940
 methods that will give you three effects 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:13.570
 different the first room and throws a 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:16.750
 tea that I think are only to use 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.940
 when you want to fill quickly 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.320
 but not really have a precise drawing 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.180
 but in any case if you're not at 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.920
 call them other methods this one 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.900
 will be really the simplest there is no 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.760
 thirty six thousand things to do there two 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.800
 methods that I have long used this 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.210
 are the headlights so there attention so 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.670
 you had an eyebrow that me who are very 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.200
 dark but well its black do not use 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.940
 a black blush it's going to be way too much 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.220
 dark for to fill all who has 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.770
 filled do not use a lighthouse either 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.810
 brown strand hot because you will have 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:47.170
 below bluefin tuna in the red eyebrow 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.970
 orange but use a lighthouse top 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.310
 and even for the brown eyebrows 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.830
 branch is purer of the toupes with its 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.540
 powders we use a beveled brush 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.010
 and the technique is more or less the 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.900
 same as the one I 'm going to show you 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.610
 that it will be done with a pencil 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.280
 so obviously if you want you 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.350
 try in pencil buy a pencil to 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.710
 any price in the three that are very 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.690
 well 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.160
 firstly civil mckee 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.600
 secondly, to sign 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.280
 cosmetics but who is not a shouting 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.200
 detractors of mme and a pencil to taez 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.280
 so that's what annoys me a bit but 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.440
 they are very good and much less 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.000
 expensive than the one at mac and that one 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.040
 that I use as you know who that 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.600
 from home to sazias beverly hills so 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.900
 how to draw them without doing 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:28.330
 damage I start tracing connect the 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.460
 head of eyebrow to body of eyebrow 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.530
 really create an oblique line 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.270
 but be careful with pencils 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.330
 will need very light hand is really 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.500
 touched the skin especially not then a 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.330
 Once that is done I attack 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.790
 body of the eyebrow so I fill the 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.460
 white jedessine the angle and I 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.680
 back down 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.229
 the end of the eyebrow again there's 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.660
 very light hand and I work 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:52.610
 just one all the lines very fine and 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.410
 very subtle last step 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.630
 we attack the head of the eyebrow what 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:58.099
 is not the most obvious part if 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.440
 you make them to women use a 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:01.880
 lighthouse lighter for this part and if 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.310
 you do them in pencil and he has - 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.990
 even lighter flew over really 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.490
 skin is there with my pencil I do not 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.590
 not movements from outside but 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.180
 to the movement so much 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.349
 as if I brush them and to yours 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.030
 she is really very softly 

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:15.650
 takes time you have to take the time 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.389
 I have you sure for this part 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.090
 must really stay zen must take 

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:23.210
 support must not breathe too sharply 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.560
 it is necessary to blow so that there is no 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.270
 cuts but I swear to apprehend 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.669
 happy and once it's over we 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:31.310
 can group them together to blend the 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:32.870
 matter and well unify everything you 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.370
 can if you want to fix them with a 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.680
 throw the source if I do not do it 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.970
 never here after all these steps I 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.380
 think we can be proud of ourselves 

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.960
 I really hope that my explanations 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.490
 will have been clear and precise I did 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.020
 my best to explain all this to you 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.539
 so here I hope they even small 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:49.039
 tips will you have and enlighten if 

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:50.900
