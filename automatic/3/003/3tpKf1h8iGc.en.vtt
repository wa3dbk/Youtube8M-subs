near the key and then you must zap this
machine<00:00:44.579> behind<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.480> key<00:00:45.719> this<00:00:46.260> will<00:00:46.469> make

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
machine behind the key this will make

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.040 
machine behind the key this will make
the<00:00:47.399> key<00:00:47.610> lower<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.090> ground<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.629> now<00:00:48.989> you

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
the key lower to the ground and now you

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.380 
the key lower to the ground and now you
can<00:00:49.320> pick<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:49.649> up<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:50.670> will<00:00:50.820> need<00:00:50.969> this<00:00:51.149> key<00:00:51.360> to

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
can pick it up you will need this key to

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.720 
can pick it up you will need this key to
obtain<00:00:51.870> all<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.379> parts<00:00:52.710> needed<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:53.190> build<00:00:53.370> the

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
obtain all the parts needed to build the

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.170 
obtain all the parts needed to build the
plane<00:00:54.000> so<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.750> necessity<00:00:55.789> step<00:00:56.789> two<00:00:57.000> is

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
plane so this is a necessity step two is

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.510 
plane so this is a necessity step two is
to<00:00:57.210> obtain<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.989> hell's<00:00:58.199> retriever<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:59.309> must
