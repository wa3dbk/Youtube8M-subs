Hello! Welcome back! 
In this video I'll show you how to create a
Spider Cake miniature, using polymer clay.
This is a Halloween project!

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:45.960
The name 'Spider Cake' is due to the decoration on top, 
that represents the cobweb!

00:00:45.960 --> 00:01:01.200

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:33.600
Take a white fimo soft. Make a 1.5 cm high cylinder,
with a 2/3 cm cutter.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:49.120
Roll to better the shape and until the cake has a 
regular shape.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:02:19.720
Ice the cake with a white clay icing.
I use fimo liquid + white fimo soft.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:04:12.000
Make a spiral design with a brown clay icing.
I use fimo liquid + brown/chocolate fimo soft.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:05:54.320
Take the pin, aim for the middle and pull the pin
to the outside of the cake, as shown in the video.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:32.480
Then, decorate, according to your taste!
I place small balls of brown clay al the bottom of the cake 
and a spider on the top.
Bake it and, if you like, glaze it.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:46.960
Thanks for watching! I hope you liked this work. 
Stay tuned for the next tutorial. Bye bye
