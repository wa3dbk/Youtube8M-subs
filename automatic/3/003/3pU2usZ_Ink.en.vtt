00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
things about the way the camera set up I

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.429 
things about the way the camera set up I
can<00:02:05.159> actually<00:02:05.670> switch<00:02:06.030> between<00:02:06.439> different

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
can actually switch between different

point<00:02:23.950> of<00:02:24.099> the<00:02:24.159> camera<00:02:24.640> you<00:02:25.090> can<00:02:25.269> turn<00:02:25.450> that<00:02:25.659> on

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
point of the camera you can turn that on

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.910 
point of the camera you can turn that on
as<00:02:26.200> well<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:27.010> there's<00:02:27.489> a<00:02:27.549> slow-motion<00:02:27.970> camera

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
as well and there's a slow-motion camera

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.000 
as well and there's a slow-motion camera
there<00:02:29.920> is<00:02:30.099> a<00:02:30.129> panorama<00:02:31.590> you<00:02:32.590> can<00:02:32.769> turn

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
there is a panorama you can turn

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.270 
there is a panorama you can turn
location<00:02:33.519> on<00:02:33.730> or<00:02:33.909> off<00:02:34.090> you<00:02:35.079> disable<00:02:36.040> the

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
location on or off you disable the

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.210 
location on or off you disable the
shutter<00:02:36.519> sound<00:02:37.079> and<00:02:38.079> you<00:02:38.470> can<00:02:38.590> also<00:02:38.739> disable

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
shutter sound and you can also disable

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.679 
shutter sound and you can also disable
the<00:02:39.549> gesture<00:02:40.000> so<00:02:40.150> if<00:02:40.239> you<00:02:40.329> find<00:02:40.569> yourself

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:40.689 
the gesture so if you find yourself

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:42.660 
the gesture so if you find yourself
flicking<00:02:41.409> your<00:02:41.500> wrist<00:02:41.560> unintentionally<00:02:42.459> in

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
flicking your wrist unintentionally in

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.610 
flicking your wrist unintentionally in
the<00:02:42.970> camera<00:02:43.299> opening<00:02:43.750> you<00:02:44.109> can<00:02:44.140> turn<00:02:44.440> that<00:02:44.560> off

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
the camera opening you can turn that off

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.170 
the camera opening you can turn that off
so<00:02:44.890> it<00:02:44.980> doesn't<00:02:45.040> happen<00:02:45.430> just<00:02:45.819> in<00:02:45.909> case<00:02:46.060> you

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
so it doesn't happen just in case you

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.520 
so it doesn't happen just in case you
were<00:02:46.269> wondering<00:02:46.629> now<00:02:47.170> you<00:02:47.260> might<00:02:47.440> have
