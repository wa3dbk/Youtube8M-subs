 1/2 small spoonful whole cumin seeds, 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.120
 Firstly we will marinate cheese 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.160
 To marinate paneer, we will take yogurt 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.940
 After taking the curd, we now add 1 tsp red chili powder, 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.380
 1/2 teaspoon roasted cumin powder, 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.240
 Chaat masala, 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.280
 1/2 turmeric 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.380
 1/2 turmeric we will keep for the appearance 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.720
 Lemon juice, 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.740
 Fenugreek seeds, 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.160
 Half ginger garlic paste 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.560
 And salt 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.620
 Now we will get all the things together 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.340
 After mixing all the things well 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.520
 We will put 2 tablespoons of oil in it. 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.740
 And it will also get better 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.980
 Now we can add onions, 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.600
 tomatoes, 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.140
 capsicum, 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.740
 Mix well 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.140
 Now we will put cheese in it. 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.600
 After mixing all the ingredients well 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.200
 We will keep it for 15 minutes to be a marine 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.720
 Until then we prepare the gravy of this 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.020
 Now we will take one tablespoon of oil in a bowl, the oil has become hot 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.920
 Now we will put cumin seeds in it. Now see, cumin is cracking. 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.520
 And it's got a little golden 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.060
 Now we will add finely chopped onion 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.420
 After going onion we will now put salt in it. 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.380
 By adding salt, the onions are cooked quickly 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.520
 Ginger will put garlic paste 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.660
 And add turmeric 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.780
 Until our onion turns transparent 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.360
 Until then we will cook it 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.240
 Now we will add coriander powder, 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.540
 chilli powder, 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.100
 Roasted cumin powder 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.500
 And fry it 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.780
 Now we will put tomato puree in it. 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.240
 When you run it you will feel 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.680
 It is difficult to run than normal gravy 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.540
 And it's sticking 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.600
 Because of the use of it 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.740
 So keep running it till you leave the oil here 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.580
 When the light oil will appear in it 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.100
 Then we will understand that our gravy is cooked 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.980
 Now look at the oil in it. 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.720
 Now we will put garam masala in it. 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.760
 We are putting it in the last so that it keeps its taste 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.580
 Now after running it well we will pour water into it. 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.100
 Now our gravy is ready 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.420
 We have been 15 minutes too 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.420
 The cheese we had kept for being a marine 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.120
 Now we can have it on the pan 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.580
 First we will allow the pan to warm well 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.700
 Then after that we will put Marie Ted Paneer in it 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.040
 Our tawa is now heated 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.440
 Now we will put cheese in it. 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.920
 And let the spices cook well 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.220
 Because our non stick is fried 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.300
 That's why we have not put oil on top 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.240
 If you are not making it non-stick on the pan 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.500
 Then you add more oil to it 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.840
 Now our cheese has been sewn from one side 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.040
 Now we will turn it over to the other side to learn 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.860
 Because tomato is soft and it gets cooked fast 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.220
 That's why we will take out the tomatoes first 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.580
 And let the other things cook 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:11.380
 Now all of our materials have been cooked well 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.600
 Now we will put it in the gravy 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.240
 The tomatoes we picked out earlier 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.160
 We will put that tomatoes in 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.580
 And get everyone together well 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.300
 Now we will turn on the gas 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.980
 To make it more tasty, we will add cream to it 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.220
 If you do not have cream 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.820
 You can also use cream in it 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.800
 We will put 3 tablespoons of cream here 

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.680
 By adding cream, its color will also be very good 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.360
 And it will look very delicious in the food 

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.240
 Now, our cheese is ready as a Tikka masala 

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.560
 Now we will shut the gas 

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.260
 And decorate it with green cheeses 

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.220
 Now our warmth is warm and tasty 

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.500
 Paneer tikka masala is ready 

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:35.440
 Now you can do it with naan, tandoori roti, paratha, rice etc. 

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.020
 Take it off 

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:41.140
 Now you make it and share your experience with me.
