00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.860 
work and I couldn't complain for a
moment<00:00:41.370> when<00:00:41.819> you<00:00:41.909> came<00:00:42.120> into<00:00:42.269> the<00:00:42.389> project<00:00:42.780> a

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
moment when you came into the project a

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.199 
moment when you came into the project a
little<00:00:43.109> late<00:00:43.319> so<00:00:44.249> how<00:00:44.399> tough<00:00:44.639> was<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.819> to<00:00:44.940> get

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:45.209 
little late so how tough was it to get

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:47.599 
little late so how tough was it to get
ready<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.600> play<00:00:45.809> her<00:00:45.989> well<00:00:46.709> you<00:00:47.129> know<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.309> think

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:47.609 
ready to play her well you know I think

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:50.299 
ready to play her well you know I think
when<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.659> writing<00:00:49.019> is<00:00:49.170> good<00:00:49.319> it's<00:00:49.889> not<00:00:50.249> that

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
when the writing is good it's not that

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.840 
when the writing is good it's not that
difficult<00:00:50.909> because<00:00:51.379> it<00:00:52.379> seems<00:00:52.829> relatable<00:00:53.519> and

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
difficult because it seems relatable and

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.729 
difficult because it seems relatable and
you<00:00:54.089> can<00:00:54.209> always<00:00:54.359> find<00:00:54.659> pieces<00:00:55.049> of<00:00:55.229> yourself

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
you can always find pieces of yourself

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.609 
you can always find pieces of yourself
in<00:00:55.949> any<00:00:56.069> character<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.389> then<00:00:58.019> you<00:00:58.139> find<00:00:58.409> all

00:00:58.609 --> 00:00:58.619 
in any character and then you find all

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:00.889 
in any character and then you find all

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
absolutely there's chemistry with the

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.810 
absolutely there's chemistry with the
two<00:01:27.750> leads<00:01:27.990> see<00:01:28.649> that<00:01:29.100> was<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.520> unique

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
two leads see that was the unique

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.630 
two leads see that was the unique
situation<00:01:30.920> there<00:01:31.920> wasn't<00:01:32.219> really<00:01:32.280> time<00:01:32.429> for

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
situation there wasn't really time for

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.380 
situation there wasn't really time for
it<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.299> by<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.079> time<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.649> was<00:01:34.920> cast<00:01:35.359> you<00:01:36.359> know

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
it I by the time I was cast you know

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.450 
it I by the time I was cast you know
from<00:01:36.600> first<00:01:36.869> meeting<00:01:37.229> DJ<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.619> table<00:01:38.310> rate<00:01:38.429> I

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
from first meeting DJ to table rate I

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.649 
from first meeting DJ to table rate I
think<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.820> was<00:01:38.939> only<00:01:39.030> about<00:01:39.240> four<00:01:39.509> days

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
think it was only about four days

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.289 
think it was only about four days
something<00:01:40.259> like<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.469> so<00:01:41.340> Alex<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:41.999> I<00:01:42.030> met

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
something like that so Alex and I met

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.139 
something like that so Alex and I met
really<00:01:42.719> quickly<00:01:43.140> somewhat<00:01:43.679> awkwardly<00:01:44.159> the

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
really quickly somewhat awkwardly the

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.209 
really quickly somewhat awkwardly the
day<00:01:45.329> before<00:01:45.539> and<00:01:46.109> just<00:01:46.439> kind<00:01:46.679> of<00:01:46.740> hashed<00:01:46.950> out

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:47.219 
day before and just kind of hashed out

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:50.389 
day before and just kind of hashed out

like that our nation is so prone to

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.830 
like that our nation is so prone to
things<00:02:36.400> being<00:02:36.640> disposable<00:02:37.330> whether<00:02:37.630> it's

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
things being disposable whether it's

dog or your spouse it's just it's kind
of<00:02:43.510> a<00:02:43.600> nice<00:02:43.780> thought<00:02:44.080> to<00:02:44.440> think<00:02:44.680> of<00:02:44.860> things<00:02:45.190> as

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
of a nice thought to think of things as

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.150 
of a nice thought to think of things as
you<00:02:46.480> know<00:02:46.600> relationships<00:02:46.870> as<00:02:47.680> being

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
you know relationships as being

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.510 
you know relationships as being
something<00:02:48.700> worth<00:02:49.120> fighting<00:02:49.420> for<00:02:50.110> and<00:02:50.860> perhaps

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
something worth fighting for and perhaps

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.220 
something worth fighting for and perhaps
it<00:02:51.940> takes<00:02:52.209> a<00:02:52.330> little<00:02:52.480> more<00:02:52.600> time<00:02:52.930> and<00:02:53.110> effort

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
it takes a little more time and effort

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.830 
it takes a little more time and effort
but<00:02:53.680> maybe<00:02:53.980> don't<00:02:54.160> give<00:02:54.400> up<00:02:54.580> as<00:02:54.730> easily<00:02:54.880> so

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
but maybe don't give up as easily so

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.100 
but maybe don't give up as easily so
that's<00:02:56.200> what<00:02:56.350> I<00:02:56.440> take<00:02:56.620> away<00:02:56.680> from
