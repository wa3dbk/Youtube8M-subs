dodgy<00:00:22.400> theater<00:00:22.730> mode<00:00:22.880> but<00:00:23.599> anyway<00:00:23.990> as<00:00:24.230> you've

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
dodgy theater mode but anyway as you've

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.260 
dodgy theater mode but anyway as you've
known<00:00:24.590> as<00:00:24.740> I'm<00:00:24.950> playing<00:00:25.220> the<00:00:25.550> new<00:00:25.730> gun<00:00:26.000> game

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.270 
known as I'm playing the new gun game

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.730 
known as I'm playing the new gun game
which<00:00:26.570> has<00:00:26.720> just<00:00:27.020> been<00:00:27.169> put<00:00:27.410> into<00:00:27.560> the

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
which has just been put into the

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.159 
which has just been put into the
free-for-all<00:00:28.189> playlist<00:00:28.700> and<00:00:28.970> this<00:00:29.930> is

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:30.169 
free-for-all playlist and this is

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:34.000 
free-for-all playlist and this is
actually<00:00:30.500> I<00:00:31.340> think<00:00:31.730> it's<00:00:32.119> 3<00:00:32.720> by<00:00:33.020> 6<00:00:33.620> or

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
actually I think it's 3 by 6 or

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.799 
actually I think it's 3 by 6 or
something<00:00:34.489> like<00:00:34.610> that<00:00:34.670> I'm<00:00:35.180> not<00:00:35.360> a<00:00:35.420> great

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
something like that I'm not a great

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.189 
something like that I'm not a great
mathematician<00:00:36.790> but<00:00:37.870> instead<00:00:38.870> of<00:00:39.019> scrolling

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:39.199 
mathematician but instead of scrolling

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:41.290 
mathematician but instead of scrolling
through<00:00:39.590> the<00:00:39.710> hole<00:00:39.860> 18<00:00:40.070> weapon<00:00:40.640> to<00:00:40.940> scroll

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
through the hole 18 weapon to scroll

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.530 
through the hole 18 weapon to scroll
through<00:00:41.360> six<00:00:41.900> of<00:00:42.050> them<00:00:42.199> three<00:00:42.530> times<00:00:42.739> I

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:43.540 
through six of them three times I

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.369 
through six of them three times I
actually<00:00:44.540> quite<00:00:44.900> like<00:00:44.960> this<00:00:45.410> one<00:00:47.140> it's<00:00:48.140> a<00:00:48.230> bit

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
actually quite like this one it's a bit

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:50.619 
actually quite like this one it's a bit
faster<00:00:48.920> as<00:00:49.100> most<00:00:49.460> of<00:00:49.699> them<00:00:49.910> are<00:00:50.059> more<00:00:50.239> close

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
faster as most of them are more close

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.610 
faster as most of them are more close
range<00:00:50.989> weapons<00:00:51.409> as<00:00:51.589> opposed<00:00:51.920> to<00:00:52.129> snipers<00:00:53.620> just

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
range weapons as opposed to snipers just

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:55.990 
range weapons as opposed to snipers just
thought<00:00:54.799> i'd<00:00:54.949> bring<00:00:55.100> you<00:00:55.190> a<00:00:55.339> little<00:00:55.670> bit<00:00:55.909> of

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
thought i'd bring you a little bit of

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.640 
thought i'd bring you a little bit of
footage<00:00:56.330> because<00:00:56.960> i'm<00:00:57.229> not<00:00:57.379> sure<00:00:57.619> that

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
footage because i'm not sure that

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.369 
footage because i'm not sure that
everyone<00:00:58.159> even<00:00:58.339> knows<00:00:58.640> this<00:00:59.089> is<00:00:59.330> been<00:01:00.110> added

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
everyone even knows this is been added

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.710 
everyone even knows this is been added
to<00:01:00.409> the<00:01:00.500> playlist<00:01:01.070> yet<00:01:01.309> and<00:01:02.150> i'm<00:01:02.330> sure<00:01:03.220> waiting

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
to the playlist yet and i'm sure waiting

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.690 
to the playlist yet and i'm sure waiting
but<00:01:05.720> this<00:01:05.930> is<00:01:06.080> a<00:01:06.110> lot<00:01:06.350> of<00:01:06.470> fun<00:01:06.650> i<00:01:07.010> really

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
but this is a lot of fun i really

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.969 
but this is a lot of fun i really
suggest<00:01:07.729> to<00:01:08.360> check<00:01:08.570> it<00:01:08.720> out<00:01:08.900> it's<00:01:09.619> quite

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
suggest to check it out it's quite

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.940 
suggest to check it out it's quite
action-packed<00:01:10.820> and<00:01:11.210> things<00:01:11.930> do<00:01:12.260> move<00:01:12.560> quite

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
action-packed and things do move quite

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.609 
action-packed and things do move quite
quickly<00:01:12.979> I<00:01:13.790> actually<00:01:14.390> haven't<00:01:15.049> had<00:01:15.200> a<00:01:15.380> game

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
quickly I actually haven't had a game

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:21.170 
quickly I actually haven't had a game
that<00:01:16.040> I've<00:01:16.790> won<00:01:18.220> more<00:01:19.220> than<00:01:19.280> three<00:01:19.850> minute

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
that I've won more than three minute

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.990 
that I've won more than three minute
which<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:22.110> pretty<00:01:22.740> fun<00:01:23.070> for<00:01:23.340> me<00:01:23.460> because<00:01:23.490> I

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
which is pretty fun for me because I

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.770 
which is pretty fun for me because I
just<00:01:24.060> love<00:01:24.300> running<00:01:24.690> around<00:01:25.050> and<00:01:26.150> the<00:01:27.150> spawns

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
just love running around and the spawns

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.630 
just love running around and the spawns
it<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.110> typical<00:01:28.560> sort<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.860> free<00:01:29.040> throws<00:01:29.340> bonds

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
it is typical sort of free throws bonds

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.580 
it is typical sort of free throws bonds
but<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.360> don't<00:01:30.540> play<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.750> lot<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:31.050> free<00:01:31.230> for<00:01:31.500> all

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
but I don't play a lot of free for all

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.540 
but I don't play a lot of free for all
so<00:01:32.330> it'll<00:01:33.330> be<00:01:33.360> more<00:01:33.630> difficult<00:01:34.070> to<00:01:35.070> work<00:01:35.250> out

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
so it'll be more difficult to work out

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.250 
so it'll be more difficult to work out
what<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:35.970> probably<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.479> for<00:01:36.600> some<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.050> you<00:01:37.140> guys

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 
what it probably is for some of you guys

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.090 
what it probably is for some of you guys
at<00:01:37.530> home<00:01:38.420> so<00:01:39.420> pretty<00:01:39.750> much<00:01:39.900> its<00:01:40.229> first<00:01:40.590> person

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
at home so pretty much its first person

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.880 
at home so pretty much its first person
to<00:01:41.250> 18<00:01:41.760> feet<00:01:42.060> although<00:01:42.900> you<00:01:43.260> can<00:01:43.710> be

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
to 18 feet although you can be

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.920 
to 18 feet although you can be
downgraded<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.090> light<00:01:45.300> whether<00:01:45.600> you're

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
downgraded to the light whether you're

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.800 
downgraded to the light whether you're
on<00:01:46.110> white<00:01:46.700> much<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.940> same<00:01:48.119> as<00:01:48.300> in<00:01:48.420> Black<00:01:48.600> Hawks

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
on white much the same as in Black Hawks

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.080 
on white much the same as in Black Hawks
so<00:01:49.619> as<00:01:49.770> you'll<00:01:49.950> notice<00:01:50.160> this<00:01:50.400> game<00:01:50.610> plays<00:01:50.850> just
