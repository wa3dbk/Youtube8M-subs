00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:07.170
 many post-war houses are 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.300
 now in need of renovation 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.860
 the weather has roof chimney and 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.860
 House facade heavily added 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.590
 who has now renovated a very good 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.599
 possibility of being home economically with 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.180
 to provide a Außenwanddämmung 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:26.279
 because the framework and everything else 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:31.830
 needed for the renovation 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:34.620
 he is already present he once 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.350
 can invest in energy saving measures 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.210
 for decades the benefit of this 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.440
 Heating costs will be in the next few years 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.629
 constantly rising 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.489
 my future pension with great 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.890
 Probability does not think for sure 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.909
 kolb his next utility bill 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.370
 He is right here like here 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:55.379
 repaired façade then that is the 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.470
 right time for an improvement 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.839
 of heat protection this family has become 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.449
 for 15 centimeter police tirol plates 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:04.229
 in a plastered 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.720
 thermal insulation composite system decided 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.790
 That's the right decision because 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.390
 it will be in the summer in the rooms 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.789
 cooler 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.619
 in winter, the comfort increases in the 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:18.030
 house heating costs decrease by 20 to 25 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.009
 and who with mold until then 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.320
 has been in mold for 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.729
 all times go on the selection of 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.649
 insulating materials for external wall insulation 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.030
 they are largely free because there is 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:29.189
 you in big number 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.100
 polystyrene plates mineral fiber 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.590
 Insulation plates or cellulose plates 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.130
 plates and much more 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.979
 It is crucial that they 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.840
 approved by building inspectorate and for their 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.299
 purses are affordable 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.460
 important the window sills need 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.920
 be distributed wherever possible 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.259
 Roller shutter boxes should be mounted outside 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.259
 so you can prevent thermal bridges 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.479
 on the insulation surfaces can 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:02.670
 normal plaster but also others 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:04.859
 be applied by coating 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.420
 the incorporated glass sides fabric 

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:09.720
 Cracking is prevented 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.730
 the plaster is stable bicycles ladders 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.110
 and other objects can without 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.610
 causing damage 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.530
 the costs for wall insulation are 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.510
 after ten to 14 years by the 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.420
 lower heating costs earned again 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:28.410
 The insulation system lasts much longer 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.390
 30 to 40 years for energy saving measures 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.459
 There are over 800 in Hesse 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.010
 opportunities for funding you can 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.140
 get low-interest loans and you 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.870
 leave savings on the bank 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.180
 The energy saving pays the biggest 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:47.310
 Part of their entire modernization 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:48.930
 the back a flash blank it beautiful 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.510
 house alone by the 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.720
 exterior wall insulation up to 25 percent 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.420
 save heating energy 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.790
 Do not spend money anymore we help 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.480
 give them their Hessian 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.480
 energy-saving action
