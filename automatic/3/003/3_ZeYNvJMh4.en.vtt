needed that help and um yeah but I flew

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
the helicopter and did all the other

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.770 
the helicopter and did all the other
stuff<00:01:16.650> but<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.220> was<00:01:17.310> good<00:01:17.490> because<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:18.000> wanted

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
stuff but it was good because I wanted

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.990 
stuff but it was good because I wanted
the<00:01:18.900> money<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.740> guess<00:01:20.100> if<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.490> do<00:01:20.670> all<00:01:20.850> the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
the money so I guess if you do all the

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.820 
the money so I guess if you do all the
work<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.540> get<00:01:21.750> most<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.350> money<00:01:22.560> but

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
work you get most of the money but

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.469 
work you get most of the money but
somehow<00:01:23.130> this<00:01:23.400> game<00:01:23.580> sometimes<00:01:24.000> mess<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.420> up

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
somehow this game sometimes mess you up

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.719 
somehow this game sometimes mess you up
in<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.320> do<00:01:25.470> all<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.740> work<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.159> get<00:01:26.340> less

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
in you do all the work and get less

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.370 
in you do all the work and get less
money<00:01:27.000> or<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.540> get<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.840> same<00:01:28.020> amount<00:01:28.049> of

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
money or you get the same amount of

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.840 
money or you get the same amount of
money<00:01:28.439> as<00:01:28.680> someone<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.159> hasn't<00:01:29.579> done

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
money as someone that hasn't done

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.539 
money as someone that hasn't done
anything<00:01:30.150> in<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.659> whole<00:01:30.840> mission<00:01:31.079> so<00:01:31.549> it's

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
anything in the whole mission so it's

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.230 
anything in the whole mission so it's
kind<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:33.860> back<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.070> forth<00:01:35.130> with<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.729> but<00:01:36.030> I

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
kind of back and forth with that but I

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.210 
kind of back and forth with that but I
don't<00:01:36.450> care<00:01:36.600> this<00:01:36.930> mission<00:01:37.320> was<00:01:37.530> great<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:38.159> had
