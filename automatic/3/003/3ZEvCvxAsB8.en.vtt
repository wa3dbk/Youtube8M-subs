personally would still choose a 6 plus

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:21.769 
personally would still choose a 6 plus
over<00:05:20.310> the<00:05:20.430> 6<00:05:20.669> because<00:05:20.940> it<00:05:21.060> offers<00:05:21.330> a<00:05:21.360> bigger

00:05:21.769 --> 00:05:21.779 
over the 6 because it offers a bigger

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:23.269

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:31.700 
doesn't offer the 6 in my opinion is
