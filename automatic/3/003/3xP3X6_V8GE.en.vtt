to share with us research that you found
about<00:01:15.690> what<00:01:16.110> ingredients<00:01:17.100> are<00:01:17.190> income

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
about what ingredients are income

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.300 
about what ingredients are income
basically<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.509> what<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:19.530> there's<00:01:20.190> a

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
basically of what it is is there's a

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.109 
basically of what it is is there's a
couple<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.850> extracts<00:01:21.840> called<00:01:22.380> Cola<00:01:23.119> extract

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
couple of extracts called Cola extract

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.530 
couple of extracts called Cola extract
and<00:01:24.540> coca<00:01:25.409> extracts<00:01:27.649> and<00:01:29.300> it's<00:01:30.300> got

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
and coca extracts and it's got

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.920 
and coca extracts and it's got
phosphoric<00:01:31.530> acid<00:01:32.160> in<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.880> it's<00:01:33.630> got

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
phosphoric acid in it and it's got

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.840 
phosphoric acid in it and it's got
caramel<00:01:34.649> coloring<00:01:35.430> so<00:01:36.289> and<00:01:37.289> that<00:01:37.830> might<00:01:38.250> give

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
caramel coloring so and that might give

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.700 
caramel coloring so and that might give
it<00:01:38.880> into<00:01:39.360> dark<00:01:39.690> color<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.800> it<00:01:41.369> has<00:01:41.789> a<00:01:42.119> secret

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
it into dark color and it has a secret

00:01:42.710 --> 00:02:05.380 
it into dark color and it has a secret
ingredient<00:01:43.710> called<00:01:44.009> 7x<00:01:45.530> and<00:01:46.530> only<00:01:47.220> two<00:01:47.460> people

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.100 

so<00:02:06.320> did<00:02:06.590> we<00:02:06.740> think<00:02:06.979> weldco<00:02:07.790> clean<00:02:08.569> of<00:02:08.780> heading

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.230 

it<00:02:12.110> also<00:02:12.350> kind<00:02:12.680> of<00:02:12.770> disappear<00:02:13.280> so<00:02:13.550> it'll<00:02:14.209> just

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
it also kind of disappear so it'll just

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.480 
it also kind of disappear so it'll just
for<00:02:14.690> men<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:17.690> ridges<00:02:18.260> for<00:02:18.770> the<00:02:18.890> picture<00:02:19.310> of

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
for men the ridges for the picture of

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.940 
for men the ridges for the picture of
Abraham<00:02:19.910> Lincoln<00:02:20.420> they<00:02:20.720> on<00:02:21.020> this<00:02:21.440> one<00:02:21.740> is<00:02:21.920> a

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
Abraham Lincoln they on this one is a

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.980 
Abraham Lincoln they on this one is a
lot<00:02:22.250> smoother<00:02:22.910> this<00:02:23.120> one's<00:02:23.360> sticking<00:02:23.780> up<00:02:23.959> a

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
lot smoother this one's sticking up a

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.270 
lot smoother this one's sticking up a
little<00:02:24.350> but<00:02:24.950> this<00:02:25.190> one<00:02:25.520> is<00:02:25.880> on<00:02:26.209> flat<00:02:26.920> so<00:02:27.920> what

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
little but this one is on flat so what

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.340 
little but this one is on flat so what
do<00:02:28.340> you<00:02:28.430> think<00:02:28.730> did<00:02:28.940> that<00:02:28.970> I<00:02:29.360> think<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.110> code

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
do you think did that I think the code

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.430 
do you think did that I think the code
maybe<00:02:31.130> like<00:02:31.489> the<00:02:31.760> girls<00:02:32.239> hiding<00:02:32.810> away<00:02:34.360> and

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
maybe like the girls hiding away and

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:43.120 
maybe like the girls hiding away and
what<00:02:36.440> what<00:02:36.709> are<00:02:36.860> the<00:02:37.040> bubbles<00:02:42.130> the

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
what what are the bubbles the

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.870 
what what are the bubbles the
carbonation<00:02:43.880> and<00:02:44.090> um<00:02:44.989> it's<00:02:45.650> it<00:02:46.190> kind<00:02:46.580> of<00:02:46.640> looks

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
carbonation and um it's it kind of looks

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.470 
carbonation and um it's it kind of looks
like<00:02:46.970> a<00:02:47.120> big<00:02:47.420> penny<00:02:47.920> because<00:02:48.920> it's<00:02:49.190> it's<00:02:50.150> a<00:02:50.239> lot

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
like a big penny because it's it's a lot

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:58.600 
like a big penny because it's it's a lot
cleaner<00:02:50.810> a<00:02:50.989> lot<00:02:51.860> more<00:02:52.040> orange

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.280 

what<00:02:59.610> do<00:02:59.760> you<00:02:59.820> think<00:03:00.000> what's<00:03:00.330> hypothesis<00:03:01.110> yeah

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
what do you think what's hypothesis yeah

yeah<00:03:12.870> how<00:03:13.870> are<00:03:14.170> you<00:03:14.470> that<00:03:14.770> if<00:03:14.860> it<00:03:14.980> was<00:03:15.190> it's<00:03:15.459> all

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
yeah how are you that if it was it's all

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.500 
yeah how are you that if it was it's all
it<00:03:16.240> could<00:03:16.450> get<00:03:16.660> big<00:03:17.640> babies<00:03:18.640> at<00:03:18.819> stake<00:03:19.150> likes

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
it could get big babies at stake likes

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.360 
it could get big babies at stake likes
idea<00:03:20.230> yeah<00:03:21.480> that<00:03:22.480> that<00:03:22.690> causes<00:03:23.170> cause<00:03:23.860> it<00:03:24.130> you

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
idea yeah that that causes cause it you

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.650 
idea yeah that that causes cause it you
made<00:03:24.550> the<00:03:24.670> comment<00:03:24.910> that<00:03:25.060> you<00:03:25.330> thought

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
made the comment that you thought

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.760 
made the comment that you thought
perhaps<00:03:26.560> it<00:03:27.130> would<00:03:27.340> dissolve<00:03:28.200> why<00:03:29.200> did<00:03:29.650> you

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
perhaps it would dissolve why did you

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.770 
perhaps it would dissolve why did you
think<00:03:29.980> that<00:03:30.100> what<00:03:30.550> about<00:03:30.670> coke<00:03:31.180> would<00:03:31.540> make

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
think that what about coke would make

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.420 
think that what about coke would make
you<00:03:31.990> think<00:03:32.020> that

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.360 

carbon<00:03:37.180> dioxide<00:03:37.629> we<00:03:37.780> deposit<00:03:38.230> per<00:03:38.439> can<00:03:38.469> the

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
carbon dioxide we deposit per can the

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.530 
carbon dioxide we deposit per can the
acid<00:03:39.879> okay<00:03:40.420> okay<00:03:41.319> so<00:03:41.469> maybe<00:03:41.769> the<00:03:41.950> acidity<00:03:42.670> made

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
acid okay okay so maybe the acidity made

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.649 
acid okay okay so maybe the acidity made
it<00:03:43.750> dissolved<00:03:44.439> and<00:03:44.650> then<00:03:45.219> we<00:03:45.730> also<00:03:45.939> could

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:46.659 
it dissolved and then we also could

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:49.740 
it dissolved and then we also could
hypothesize<00:03:47.170> it<00:03:48.159> could<00:03:48.939> have<00:03:49.060> absorbed<00:03:49.510> some

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
hypothesize it could have absorbed some

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.040 
hypothesize it could have absorbed some
of<00:03:49.930> the<00:03:50.200> liquid

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.660 

let's<00:03:55.050> take<00:03:55.319> a<00:03:55.349> look<00:03:55.709> at<00:03:55.860> the<00:03:56.010> other<00:03:56.040> teeth

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
let's take a look at the other teeth

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.170 
let's take a look at the other teeth
just<00:03:57.300> induce<00:03:57.810> person<00:03:58.349> we<00:03:58.530> did<00:03:58.940> popping<00:03:59.940> teeth

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
just induce person we did popping teeth

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.559 
just induce person we did popping teeth
we<00:04:00.480> did<00:04:00.659> baby<00:04:00.959> teeth<00:04:01.409> we<00:04:01.680> did<00:04:01.920> Conrad<00:04:02.569> donated

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
we did baby teeth we did Conrad donated

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.390 
we did baby teeth we did Conrad donated
his<00:04:03.690> tube<00:04:03.989> the<00:04:04.230> science<00:04:04.650> with<00:04:04.799> the<00:04:04.830> student

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
his tube the science with the student

molar<00:04:05.640> we<00:04:06.450> did<00:04:06.750> a<00:04:06.959> team<00:04:07.860> from<00:04:08.129> the<00:04:08.370> dentist

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
molar we did a team from the dentist

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:11.449 
molar we did a team from the dentist
that<00:04:09.540> were<00:04:09.750> extracted<00:04:10.620> and<00:04:10.769> then<00:04:10.890> put<00:04:11.160> into<00:04:11.430> a

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
that were extracted and then put into a

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:12.979 
that were extracted and then put into a
chemical<00:04:12.120> to<00:04:12.209> sort<00:04:12.450> of<00:04:12.540> clean<00:04:12.750> mountain

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
chemical to sort of clean mountain

preserve<00:04:13.319> them<00:04:13.860> let's<00:04:14.549> see<00:04:14.819> if<00:04:15.090> any<00:04:15.510> of<00:04:15.660> that

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
preserve them let's see if any of that

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.469 
preserve them let's see if any of that
made<00:04:15.989> difference<00:04:16.470> or<00:04:16.699> every<00:04:17.699> type<00:04:17.910> of<00:04:17.940> two<00:04:18.470> was

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
made difference or every type of two was

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:26.690 
made difference or every type of two was
affected

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.360
