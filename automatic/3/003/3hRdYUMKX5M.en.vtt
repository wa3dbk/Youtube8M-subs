00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
line was like actually like a hard

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.040 
line was like actually like a hard
plastic<00:01:50.349> this<00:01:51.039> here<00:01:51.280> is<00:01:51.399> actually<00:01:51.670> a<00:01:51.729> very

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
plastic this here is actually a very

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.210 
plastic this here is actually a very
soft<00:01:53.050> plastic<00:01:53.860> which<00:01:54.069> works<00:01:54.310> very<00:01:54.520> well<00:01:56.220> again

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
soft plastic which works very well again

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.279 
soft plastic which works very well again
it's<00:01:57.399> just<00:01:57.459> too<00:01:57.849> small<00:01:58.030> pegs<00:01:58.450> with<00:01:59.110> too<00:01:59.259> little

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
it's just too small pegs with too little

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:01.650 
it's just too small pegs with too little
holes<00:01:59.679> on<00:01:59.830> either<00:01:59.979> side<00:02:00.340> which<00:02:00.610> is<00:02:00.729> how<00:02:00.910> the

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
holes on either side which is how the

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.699 
holes on either side which is how the
armor<00:02:02.020> fastens<00:02:02.940> it's<00:02:03.940> very<00:02:04.539> simple<00:02:04.989> and<00:02:05.380> yet

00:02:05.699 --> 00:02:05.709 
armor fastens it's very simple and yet

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:09.540 
armor fastens it's very simple and yet
very<00:02:06.009> effective<00:02:06.489> I<00:02:06.670> would<00:02:06.849> say<00:02:08.099> now<00:02:09.099> of<00:02:09.310> course

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
very effective I would say now of course

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.550 
very effective I would say now of course

sculpted<00:02:44.170> on<00:02:44.260> like<00:02:44.470> we've<00:02:44.650> seen<00:02:44.860> so<00:02:45.130> far<00:02:45.160> with

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
sculpted on like we've seen so far with

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.130 
sculpted on like we've seen so far with
all<00:02:45.760> of<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.000> other<00:02:46.120> figures<00:02:46.390> like<00:02:46.690> he-man<00:02:46.930> and

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
all of the other figures like he-man and

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.130 
all of the other figures like he-man and
Skeletor<00:02:47.400> he<00:02:48.400> is<00:02:48.550> a<00:02:48.580> solid<00:02:49.540> black<00:02:49.690> piece<00:02:50.110> of

Skeletor he is a solid black piece of

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.380 
Skeletor he is a solid black piece of
plastic<00:02:51.090> now

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
plastic now

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.110 
plastic now
reason<00:02:53.230> for<00:02:53.500> that<00:02:53.740> let's<00:02:54.370> put<00:02:54.610> the<00:02:54.700> armor<00:02:54.970> back

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
reason for that let's put the armor back

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:08.170 
reason for that let's put the armor back
on<00:02:55.150> so<00:02:55.540> we<00:02:55.570> can<00:02:55.780> take<00:02:55.930> a<00:02:55.960> look<00:02:56.140> at<00:02:56.290> this<00:02:56.410> again

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.480 

okay

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.080 

so<00:03:12.420> as<00:03:12.540> you<00:03:12.720> can<00:03:12.810> see<00:03:13.160> horde<00:03:14.160> x<00:03:14.340> armor<00:03:14.700> back<00:03:14.880> in

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
so as you can see horde x armor back in

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.980 
so as you can see horde x armor back in

obviously<00:03:54.480> the<00:03:54.690> reason<00:03:54.990> Mattel<00:03:55.890> and<00:03:56.280> the

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
obviously the reason Mattel and the

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.180 
obviously the reason Mattel and the
horsemen<00:03:57.390> you<00:03:57.930> know<00:03:58.050> designed<00:03:58.530> it<00:03:58.740> this<00:03:58.890> way

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
horsemen you know designed it this way

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.720 
horsemen you know designed it this way
is<00:04:00.020> as<00:04:01.020> not<00:04:01.530> to<00:04:01.860> alter<00:04:02.100> that<00:04:02.640> articulation<00:04:03.650> on

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
is as not to alter that articulation on

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.270 
is as not to alter that articulation on
the<00:04:05.730> torso<00:04:05.940> see<00:04:06.720> with<00:04:06.960> this<00:04:07.110> armor<00:04:07.500> with<00:04:07.680> them

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
the torso see with this armor with them

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.610 
the torso see with this armor with them
using<00:04:08.610> the<00:04:08.730> soft<00:04:08.970> plastic<00:04:09.600> and<00:04:09.960> with<00:04:10.440> it<00:04:10.590> being

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
using the soft plastic and with it being

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.890 
using the soft plastic and with it being
cut<00:04:10.920> off<00:04:11.010> of<00:04:11.040> the<00:04:11.220> stomach<00:04:11.610> this<00:04:12.000> still<00:04:12.390> allows

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
cut off of the stomach this still allows

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.430 
cut off of the stomach this still allows
for<00:04:13.230> a<00:04:13.260> range<00:04:13.590> of<00:04:13.860> motion<00:04:14.070> on<00:04:14.400> Hordak<00:04:15.290> this<00:04:16.290> is

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
for a range of motion on Hordak this is

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.590 
for a range of motion on Hordak this is
also<00:04:16.920> why<00:04:17.100> we<00:04:17.130> have<00:04:17.580> these<00:04:17.760> smooth<00:04:18.030> plastic

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
also why we have these smooth plastic

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.510 
also why we have these smooth plastic
here<00:04:18.900> it's<00:04:19.290> as<00:04:19.500> if<00:04:19.650> it's<00:04:19.860> still<00:04:20.100> you<00:04:20.340> know<00:04:20.370> a

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.520 
here it's as if it's still you know a

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.370 
here it's as if it's still you know a
piece<00:04:21.030> of<00:04:21.239> the<00:04:21.360> armor<00:04:21.510> down<00:04:21.840> that's<00:04:22.080> just<00:04:22.140> not

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.320 
piece of the armor down that's just not
connected<00:04:22.980> this<00:04:23.130> way<00:04:23.370> we<00:04:23.550> don't<00:04:23.670> have<00:04:23.790> his<00:04:24.150> at

really think there's much of a problem

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:11.180 
really think there's much of a problem
it<00:05:06.900> looks<00:05:07.410> fine<00:05:08.870> in<00:05:09.870> and<00:05:10.470> if<00:05:10.710> you<00:05:10.830> want<00:05:11.010> me<00:05:11.100> to

be completely honest I really don't mind

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.410 
be completely honest I really don't mind
it<00:05:13.890> maybe<00:05:14.160> it's<00:05:14.370> because<00:05:14.520> I'm<00:05:14.850> seeing<00:05:15.120> it<00:05:15.240> here

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:15.420 
it maybe it's because I'm seeing it here

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.440 
it maybe it's because I'm seeing it here
in<00:05:15.510> person<00:05:16.220> and<00:05:17.220> and<00:05:17.520> everybody<00:05:18.030> else<00:05:18.180> still

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
in person and and everybody else still

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.850 
in person and and everybody else still
needs<00:05:18.660> a<00:05:18.780> chance<00:05:19.020> to<00:05:19.200> actually<00:05:19.470> take<00:05:19.650> a<00:05:19.680> look

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
needs a chance to actually take a look

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.090 
needs a chance to actually take a look
at<00:05:20.070> it<00:05:20.220> but<00:05:20.340> I<00:05:20.370> do<00:05:20.730> think<00:05:21.330> that<00:05:21.419> it<00:05:22.260> works<00:05:22.770> it

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
at it but I do think that it works it

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.270 
at it but I do think that it works it
works<00:05:23.250> fine<00:05:23.550> I<00:05:23.820> don't<00:05:24.150> think<00:05:24.480> it<00:05:24.570> looks<00:05:24.720> bad

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
works fine I don't think it looks bad

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.510 
works fine I don't think it looks bad
think<00:05:25.490> it's<00:05:26.230> it's<00:05:27.230> as<00:05:27.500> silly<00:05:27.920> as<00:05:28.130> some<00:05:28.370> people

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
think it's it's as silly as some people

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.490 
think it's it's as silly as some people
are<00:05:28.760> claiming<00:05:29.120> it<00:05:29.360> to<00:05:29.389> be<00:05:29.510> saying<00:05:30.170> you<00:05:30.380> know

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
are claiming it to be saying you know

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.680 
are claiming it to be saying you know
it's<00:05:30.710> like<00:05:30.830> a<00:05:30.860> belly<00:05:31.160> shirt<00:05:31.280> or<00:05:31.700> whatever<00:05:32.000> but

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
it's like a belly shirt or whatever but

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.290 
it's like a belly shirt or whatever but
again<00:05:33.380> this<00:05:33.590> is<00:05:33.770> all<00:05:33.950> completely<00:05:34.520> opinionated

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
again this is all completely opinionated

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.159 
again this is all completely opinionated
everybody's<00:05:35.660> gonna<00:05:35.750> have<00:05:35.930> their<00:05:36.139> own

everybody's gonna have their own

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:39.850 
everybody's gonna have their own
opinions<00:05:36.710> about<00:05:36.830> this<00:05:37.250> and<00:05:38.650> that's<00:05:39.650> really

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860
