00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
to dig at a certain distance I suppose

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.260 
to dig at a certain distance I suppose
to<00:00:51.420> actually<00:00:51.780> find<00:00:52.110> diamonds<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:53.090> we're<00:00:54.090> gonna

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
to actually find diamonds so we're gonna

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.740 
to actually find diamonds so we're gonna
go<00:00:54.570> ahead<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:55.020> make<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.969> wooden<00:00:56.969> pickaxe<00:00:57.360> here

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
go ahead and make a wooden pickaxe here

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.080 
go ahead and make a wooden pickaxe here
and<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.230> workbench<00:00:58.649> obviously<00:00:59.930> okay<00:01:01.969> there<00:01:02.969> we

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
and it workbench obviously okay there we

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.410 
and it workbench obviously okay there we
go<00:01:03.120> perfect<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.549> then<00:01:05.549> you're<00:01:05.820> gonna<00:01:05.970> have<00:01:06.240> to

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
go perfect and then you're gonna have to

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.929 
go perfect and then you're gonna have to
get<00:01:06.930> some<00:01:07.260> cobblestone<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:08.070> make<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.400> furnace

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
get some cobblestone to make a furnace

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.320 
get some cobblestone to make a furnace
and<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.390> pickaxe<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.670> then<00:01:11.670> you're<00:01:11.850> gonna<00:01:12.000> have

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
and a pickaxe and then you're gonna have

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.940 
and a pickaxe and then you're gonna have
to<00:01:12.360> go<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.049> look<00:01:13.290> for<00:01:13.590> some<00:01:13.860> iron<00:01:14.130> I'm<00:01:15.060> sorry

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
to go and look for some iron I'm sorry

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.149 
to go and look for some iron I'm sorry
okay

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
okay

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.050 
okay
so<00:01:17.759> let's<00:01:18.060> quickly<00:01:18.570> make<00:01:18.990> this<00:01:19.320> here<00:01:20.060> now

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
so let's quickly make this here now

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.020 
so let's quickly make this here now
let's<00:01:21.360> just<00:01:21.570> go<00:01:21.780> digging<00:01:22.580> so<00:01:23.580> this<00:01:25.850> tip<00:01:26.850> I

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
let's just go digging so this tip I

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.789 
let's just go digging so this tip I
suppose<00:01:27.420> actually<00:01:27.810> involves<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.560> lot<00:01:28.680> of

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
suppose actually involves a lot of

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.319 
suppose actually involves a lot of
digging<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:29.549> you're<00:01:29.790> just<00:01:29.939> gonna<00:01:30.090> be

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
digging so you're just gonna be

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.319 
digging so you're just gonna be
basically<00:01:30.960> digging<00:01:31.470> straight<00:01:31.920> down<00:01:32.329> because

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
basically digging straight down because

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.140 
basically digging straight down because
yeah<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.200> have<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.650> hit<00:01:34.950> bedrock<00:01:35.189> okay<00:01:35.850> that

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
yeah you have to hit bedrock okay that

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.620 
yeah you have to hit bedrock okay that
was<00:01:36.240> lucky

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
was lucky

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.469 
was lucky
so<00:01:37.500> now<00:01:37.650> we've<00:01:37.799> got<00:01:38.009> some<00:01:38.189> unperfect<00:01:38.880> okay

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
so now we've got some unperfect okay

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.539 
so now we've got some unperfect okay
we're<00:01:39.630> gonna<00:01:39.720> make<00:01:39.960> another<00:01:40.590> pickaxe<00:01:41.159> here

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
we're gonna make another pickaxe here

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.280 
we're gonna make another pickaxe here

perfect

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
perfect

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.220 
perfect
okay<00:02:43.650> let's<00:02:43.860> quickly<00:02:44.400> quickly<00:02:45.150> make<00:02:45.390> one<00:02:46.140> of

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
okay let's quickly quickly make one of

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.320 
okay let's quickly quickly make one of
these<00:02:46.380> and<00:02:46.620> you're<00:02:46.890> just<00:02:47.220> basically<00:02:47.670> gonna<00:02:48.000> go

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
these and you're just basically gonna go

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.720 
these and you're just basically gonna go
digging<00:02:48.840> straight<00:02:49.590> down<00:02:49.890> until<00:02:50.190> you<00:02:50.550> hit

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
digging straight down until you hit

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.280 
digging straight down until you hit
bedrock<00:02:51.470> so<00:02:52.470> let's<00:02:52.800> do<00:02:53.069> that<00:02:53.599> okay<00:02:54.630> nearly

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
bedrock so let's do that okay nearly

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.309 
bedrock so let's do that okay nearly
there<00:02:55.680> I<00:02:55.739> guess<00:02:56.099> and<00:02:56.930> by<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:57.989> way<00:02:58.080> this<00:02:58.170> video

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
there I guess and by the way this video

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.020 
there I guess and by the way this video
is<00:02:58.560> fast<00:02:58.830> forward<00:02:59.130> that<00:02:59.280> if<00:02:59.400> you<00:02:59.489> haven't

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
is fast forward that if you haven't

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.880 
is fast forward that if you haven't
figured<00:03:00.450> that<00:03:00.480> out<00:03:00.599> until<00:03:01.200> now<00:03:02.690> okay<00:03:03.890> there

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
figured that out until now okay there

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.650 
figured that out until now okay there
you<00:03:04.920> go<00:03:05.040> now<00:03:05.459> that<00:03:05.489> you<00:03:05.730> fit<00:03:05.970> bedrock<00:03:06.450> you're

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
you go now that you fit bedrock you're

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.610 
you go now that you fit bedrock you're
gonna<00:03:06.870> want<00:03:07.440> to<00:03:07.530> go<00:03:07.680> eight<00:03:07.920> blocks<00:03:08.610> up<00:03:09.080> so<00:03:10.080> as

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
gonna want to go eight blocks up so as

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.340 
gonna want to go eight blocks up so as
you<00:03:10.830> can<00:03:10.950> see<00:03:11.190> here<00:03:11.430> eight<00:03:11.610> blocks<00:03:11.970> and<00:03:12.350> from

you can see here eight blocks and from

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.500

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
this level a diamond actually spawns

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.449 
this level a diamond actually spawns
between<00:03:15.870> eight<00:03:16.080> and<00:03:16.290> twelve<00:03:16.769> so<00:03:17.100> you're<00:03:17.280> just

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
gonna go strip mining and between these

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.830 
gonna go strip mining and between these
dis<00:03:20.519> levels<00:03:20.940> and<00:03:21.180> you<00:03:21.330> should<00:03:21.600> find
