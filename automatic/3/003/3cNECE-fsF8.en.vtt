00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.800
 With us is Lieutenant Halls and Lieutenant Ewing of the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment, 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.500
 to which I have a warm relationship since I served in it. 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.700
 We stand in front of the British Army pillar, Challenger 2. 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.600
 What's new in the regiment? 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.800
 Currently, the regiment is deployed on battlefields. 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.000
 Operation Herrick 18 in Afghanistan was launched. 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.300
 There are two goals. 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.550
 Provide transport for close combat combat units in Helmand province with Warthog machines 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.000
 which are now the main armored vehicles of the British Army. 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.200
 Another infantry squad then trains the Afghan National Police. 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.000
 This is the last regiment service before the next year's merger. 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.300
 We are pleased to be part of Afghanistan's operation to the end. 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.000
 You mentioned that you occasionally play World of Tanks, which caught my eye. 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.300
 That's right, I play from time to time. 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.400
 Sometimes I get it right. 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.500
 I guess I'm not as good as a tanker, but before I enlisted, I played quite often. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.250
 As a former tanker, they often ask me: 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.300
 To what extent does the game reflect the reality of a real tanker? 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.500
 Can you compare the game of World of Tanks and the life of a real tanker? 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.400
 I think, in principle, in terms of ground movement. I guess it's kind of similar. 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.600
 In reality, however, the average clash will take place over 1000 meters or more. 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.900
 Anything below 800 meters is considered a clash close up. 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.500
 So a clash in which you would circle 25 meters from an enemy is unlikely. 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.300
 But in terms of how the vehicle is used and its possibilities, I would say it is quite realistic. 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.550
 Hi, this is Challenger 2, the British Army's main battle tank. 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.600
 It's known as Megatron and it's our "80DU" 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.450
 So tank test and development units. 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.650
 It undergoes individual steps, analyzes and evaluations. 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.800
 We try to find as many possibilities as possible to improve it. 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.450
 At the moment, the front part is equipped with a 120mm grooved cannon. 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.550
 Smoke grenades and remote controlled gun stations are mounted on the top. 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.100
 It can be used in a variety of environments and fits into many situations. 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.250
 Side and front armor is known as the "Chobham Armor" 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.400
 and information about it is secret. 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.000
 The British Army is making a lot of effort to keep this information secret. 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.450
 The only other country we share this information with is the United States and not all of them. 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:46.550
 Inside you will find a Rolls Royce CV12 engine that speeds up to 59 km / h. 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.500
 He can handle almost any terrain you go with. 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.000
 As you can see under the wheels, it is equipped with a hydropneumatic chassis. 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.450
 The beauty is that the faster you go and the more bumps you hit, the smoother the ride. 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:09.000
 On the contrary, the slower you go, the more you will feel the bumps on the seat. 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.900
 The tower can rotate 360 ​​degrees quickly. 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:22.000
 The only drawback is that it is unable to shoot through the back of the hull, which is mainly due to fire in its own ranks. 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.600
 Up to three crew members can sit in the main battle area - entry through the tower's hatch. 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.800
 So: Commander, 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.400
 a shooter who sits between his feet and a charger opposite the cannon. 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.600
 And finally, the driver sitting in the front seat in the main body of the engine. 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.700
 His main task is to get you from point A to point B while enjoying the best possible ground cover. 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.700
 And that's a Challenger 2 tank in a nutshell.
