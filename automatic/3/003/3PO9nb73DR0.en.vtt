hey guys john be here from phone ringing

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.460 
hey guys john be here from phone ringing
on<00:00:03.959> taking<00:00:04.319> a<00:00:04.350> look<00:00:04.529> at<00:00:04.710> the<00:00:04.920> LG<00:00:05.370> nitro<00:00:05.850> HD

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:06.470 
on taking a look at the LG nitro HD

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.720 
on taking a look at the LG nitro HD
gonna<00:00:07.470> run<00:00:07.620> a<00:00:07.649> couple<00:00:07.830> different<00:00:08.250> benchmark

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
gonna run a couple different benchmark

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.580 
gonna run a couple different benchmark
test<00:00:09.030> to<00:00:09.210> show<00:00:09.389> you<00:00:09.450> guys<00:00:09.570> what<00:00:10.019> kind<00:00:10.230> results

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
test to show you guys what kind results

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.470 
test to show you guys what kind results

usage with its dual core processor it's

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.540 
usage with its dual core processor it's
decent<00:00:15.630> but<00:00:16.049> sometimes<00:00:16.440> it<00:00:16.619> is<00:00:16.830> lagging<00:00:17.430> you

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
decent but sometimes it is lagging you

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.769 
decent but sometimes it is lagging you
could<00:00:17.699> tell<00:00:17.880> here<00:00:18.060> just<00:00:18.270> navigating<00:00:18.660> across

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
could tell here just navigating across

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.320 
could tell here just navigating across
the<00:00:19.050> home<00:00:19.199> screen<00:00:19.560> it<00:00:20.520> doesn't<00:00:20.789> quite<00:00:20.880> keep<00:00:21.180> up

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
the home screen it doesn't quite keep up

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.240 
the home screen it doesn't quite keep up
with<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.720> tracking<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.560> my<00:00:22.680> finger<00:00:23.100> here

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
with the tracking of my finger here

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.830 
with the tracking of my finger here
never<00:00:23.640> now<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:23.910> then<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.090> do<00:00:24.240> notice<00:00:24.510> some

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
never now and then you do notice some

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.650 
never now and then you do notice some
choppiness<00:00:25.320> with<00:00:25.619> its<00:00:25.800> movement<00:00:26.310> but<00:00:27.150> it's<00:00:27.599> a

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
choppiness with its movement but it's a

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.849 
choppiness with its movement but it's a
little<00:00:27.750> more<00:00:27.869> than<00:00:28.019> acceptable<00:00:28.260> nothing

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
little more than acceptable nothing

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.859 
little more than acceptable nothing
really<00:00:29.070> that<00:00:29.099> bad<00:00:29.400> tell<00:00:29.699> you<00:00:29.820> true<00:00:30.060> so<00:00:30.689> let's

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
really that bad tell you true so let's

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.299 
really that bad tell you true so let's
get<00:00:30.990> started<00:00:31.109> let's<00:00:31.710> run<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.040> first

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
get started let's run the first

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.250 
get started let's run the first
benchmark<00:00:32.700> test<00:00:33.120> we've<00:00:33.630> already<00:00:33.780> ran<00:00:34.079> the

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
benchmark test we've already ran the

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.979 
benchmark test we've already ran the
quadrant<00:00:34.860> benchmark<00:00:35.309> test<00:00:35.550> first<00:00:36.540> time<00:00:36.750> here

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
quadrant benchmark test first time here

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.860 
quadrant benchmark test first time here
it<00:00:37.140> looks<00:00:37.290> like<00:00:37.380> managed<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:37.920> get<00:00:38.480> 2574<00:00:39.480> score

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
it looks like managed to get 2574 score

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.290 
it looks like managed to get 2574 score
so<00:00:40.379> let's<00:00:40.559> just<00:00:40.739> do<00:00:41.100> this<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.309> few<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.969> couple

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
so let's just do this a few a couple

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.459 
so let's just do this a few a couple
more<00:00:42.420> times<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.899> see<00:00:43.110> if<00:00:43.200> we<00:00:43.290> get<00:00:43.410> a

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
more times and see if we get a

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.549 
more times and see if we get a
consistent<00:00:43.829> scorer<00:00:45.050> and<00:00:46.050> you'll<00:00:46.230> notice<00:00:46.530> that

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
consistent scorer and you'll notice that

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.770 
consistent scorer and you'll notice that
it<00:00:46.829> does<00:00:47.070> run<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.430> test<00:00:47.969> fairly<00:00:48.390> quickly<00:00:48.629> so

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
it does run the test fairly quickly so

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.410 
it does run the test fairly quickly so
you<00:00:48.989> know<00:00:49.140> it's<00:00:49.289> still<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.530> fast<00:00:49.860> device<00:00:50.420> even

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
you know it's still a fast device even

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.510 
you know it's still a fast device even
though<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.750> does<00:00:51.930> exhibit<00:00:52.230> some<00:00:52.680> choppiness

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
though it does exhibit some choppiness

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.459 
though it does exhibit some choppiness
with<00:00:53.760> its<00:00:53.940> operation<00:00:54.809> but<00:00:54.989> then<00:00:55.110> again<00:00:55.199> that

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
with its operation but then again that

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.130 
with its operation but then again that
could<00:00:55.559> be<00:00:55.680> just<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.890> trip<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.610> skin<00:00:57.480> running

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
could be just a trip to the skin running

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.959 
could be just a trip to the skin running
on<00:00:58.230> top<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.859> everything<00:00:59.190> else<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.579> LG<00:00:59.940> optimus

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
on top of everything else the LG optimus

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.229 
on top of everything else the LG optimus
skin<00:01:00.660> with<00:01:01.230> its<00:01:01.620> various<00:01:02.190> widgets<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:03.090> all

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
skin with its various widgets and all

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.179 
skin with its various widgets and all
that<00:01:03.390> fun<00:01:03.629> stuff<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:04.470> course<00:01:04.799> it's<00:01:05.010> going<00:01:05.040> to

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
that fun stuff of course it's going to

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.219 
that fun stuff of course it's going to
the<00:01:05.640> contribution<00:01:06.299> maybe<00:01:06.479> some<00:01:06.810> choppiness

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
the contribution maybe some choppiness

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.370 
the contribution maybe some choppiness
but<00:01:07.560> who<00:01:08.040> knows<00:01:08.420> so<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.720> looks<00:01:09.750> like<00:01:09.869> these<00:01:10.170> the

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
but who knows so it looks like these the

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.230 
but who knows so it looks like these the
graphical<00:01:10.860> tests<00:01:11.280> running<00:01:11.520> roughly<00:01:12.090> around

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
graphical tests running roughly around

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.230 
graphical tests running roughly around
30<00:01:12.600> frames<00:01:12.960> per<00:01:13.110> second<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.490> it's<00:01:14.970> still

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
30 frames per second so it's still

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.789 
30 frames per second so it's still
pretty<00:01:15.360> smooth<00:01:15.689> it's<00:01:16.020> dropping<00:01:16.380> dropping

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
pretty smooth it's dropping dropping

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.649 
pretty smooth it's dropping dropping
down<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.430> know<00:01:17.520> down<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.150> 20<00:01:18.479> frames

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
down you know down to you in 20 frames

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.530 
down you know down to you in 20 frames
per<00:01:19.080> second<00:01:19.470> at<00:01:19.560> times<00:01:20.030> this<00:01:21.030> one<00:01:21.210> here<00:01:21.360> looks

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
per second at times this one here looks

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.109 
per second at times this one here looks
like<00:01:21.720> it's<00:01:21.900> consistently<00:01:22.619> at<00:01:22.950> 60<00:01:23.610> frames<00:01:23.640> per

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
like it's consistently at 60 frames per

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.880 
like it's consistently at 60 frames per
second<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.049> it's<00:01:25.229> pretty<00:01:25.439> good<00:01:25.939> and<00:01:27.650> last<00:01:28.650> one

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
second so it's pretty good and last one

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.940 
second so it's pretty good and last one
roughly<00:01:29.520> between<00:01:29.610> 25<00:01:30.299> 26<00:01:30.900> frames<00:01:31.200> per<00:01:31.500> second

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
roughly between 25 26 frames per second

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.770 
roughly between 25 26 frames per second
on<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.130> average<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:33.299> this<00:01:33.540> should<00:01:33.630> be

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
on the average and this should be

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.440 
on the average and this should be
finishing<00:01:34.259> up<00:01:34.470> soon<00:01:34.759> and<00:01:35.759> let's<00:01:36.240> see<00:01:36.360> the

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
finishing up soon and let's see the

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.920 
finishing up soon and let's see the
first<00:01:36.600> chord<00:01:36.930> we<00:01:37.200> got<00:01:37.320> here<00:01:37.530> is<00:01:38.450> 2520<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.659> looks

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
first chord we got here is 2520 it looks

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.200 
first chord we got here is 2520 it looks
like<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:40.530> fairly<00:01:41.040> consistent<00:01:41.640> scorer<00:01:41.909> from

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
like so fairly consistent scorer from

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.289 
like so fairly consistent scorer from
before<00:01:42.540> let's<00:01:43.380> run<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:43.770> one<00:01:44.070> more<00:01:44.250> time<00:01:44.460> see

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
before let's run this one more time see

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.300 
before let's run this one more time see
if<00:01:45.329> we<00:01:45.689> get<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:46.020> same<00:01:46.350> score<00:01:46.649> so<00:01:46.829> roughly<00:01:47.189> around

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
if we get a same score so roughly around

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.910 
if we get a same score so roughly around
2,500<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.390> course<00:01:48.990> that's<00:01:49.170> nothing<00:01:49.320> stellar

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
2,500 of course that's nothing stellar

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.010 
2,500 of course that's nothing stellar
just<00:01:50.250> because<00:01:50.460> we've<00:01:50.579> seen<00:01:50.759> devices<00:01:51.630> like<00:01:51.780> the

just because we've seen devices like the

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.179 
just because we've seen devices like the

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
frames per second it looks like jump

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.400

jumping<00:02:15.340> down<00:02:15.940> a<00:02:16.240> little<00:02:16.390> bit<00:02:16.630> every<00:02:16.870> now<00:02:17.170> and

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
jumping down a little bit every now and

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.980 
jumping down a little bit every now and
then<00:02:17.500> down<00:02:17.770> to<00:02:17.980> 20<00:02:18.250> frames<00:02:18.490> per<00:02:18.850> second<00:02:19.270> this

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980

graphical test here roughly 30 frames
per<00:02:29.590> second<00:02:30.220> it<00:02:30.280> looks<00:02:30.430> like<00:02:30.580> and<00:02:30.820> we'll<00:02:31.780> get

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
per second it looks like and we'll get

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.210 
per second it looks like and we'll get
the<00:02:32.080> last<00:02:32.230> score<00:02:33.690> so<00:02:34.690> this<00:02:34.990> time<00:02:35.020> it<00:02:35.890> gives<00:02:36.070> us

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
the last score so this time it gives us

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:42.030 
the last score so this time it gives us
a<00:02:36.340> score<00:02:36.730> of<00:02:37.860> 22<00:02:39.120> 2307<00:02:40.120> yeah<00:02:40.690> 2307<00:02:41.440> so<00:02:41.770> drop

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
a score of 22 2307 yeah 2307 so drop

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.650 
a score of 22 2307 yeah 2307 so drop
down<00:02:42.250> a<00:02:42.280> little<00:02:42.520> bit<00:02:42.760> but<00:02:43.300> it's<00:02:43.420> roughly

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
down a little bit but it's roughly

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.230 
down a little bit but it's roughly
between<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:44.260> two<00:02:44.440> thousand<00:02:44.920> to<00:02:45.100> 2,600<00:02:46.030> mark

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.500 
chart here you could tell the Galaxy
Nexus<00:03:08.650> is<00:03:09.100> just<00:03:09.370> a<00:03:09.490> little<00:03:09.700> bit<00:03:09.910> above<00:03:10.120> it<00:03:10.300> it

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
Nexus is just a little bit above it it

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.840 
Nexus is just a little bit above it it
does<00:03:10.810> better<00:03:11.050> than<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.560> galaxy<00:03:12.130> s2<00:03:12.280> the

does better than the galaxy s2 the
optimus<00:03:13.300> 2x<00:03:13.510> the<00:03:13.960> zooms<00:03:14.260> before<00:03:15.070> that<00:03:15.250> so<00:03:15.460> it's

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
optimus 2x the zooms before that so it's

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.180 
optimus 2x the zooms before that so it's
pretty<00:03:15.730> reasonable<00:03:16.480> with<00:03:16.660> its<00:03:17.350> results<00:03:17.920> here

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
pretty reasonable with its results here

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.940 
pretty reasonable with its results here
but<00:03:18.490> again<00:03:19.120> that's<00:03:19.900> just<00:03:20.170> the<00:03:20.290> benchmark<00:03:20.740> test

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
but again that's just the benchmark test

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.680 
but again that's just the benchmark test
you<00:03:21.130> got<00:03:21.310> to<00:03:21.430> look<00:03:21.640> at<00:03:21.760> it<00:03:21.790> with<00:03:22.060> the<00:03:22.210> overall
