00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
I've always thought that that was

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.320 
I've always thought that that was
normality<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:24.900> then<00:00:25.320> obviously<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:26.060> came<00:00:27.060> to

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
normality and then obviously I came to

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.929 
normality and then obviously I came to
London<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:27.930> this<00:00:28.470> pie<00:00:28.710> is<00:00:28.980> an<00:00:29.279> extremely

it
my<00:00:53.280> connection<00:00:53.969> with<00:00:54.300> cacti<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:55.079> quite

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
my connection with cacti is quite

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.740 
my connection with cacti is quite
strange<00:00:55.860> because<00:00:56.160> where<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.789> come<00:00:57.120> from<00:00:57.149> there

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
strange because where I come from there

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.039 
strange because where I come from there
are<00:00:57.899> obviously<00:00:58.379> not<00:00:59.039> cacti<00:00:59.550> and<00:01:01.489> it<00:01:02.719> I'm<00:01:03.719> not

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
are obviously not cacti and it I'm not

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.460 
are obviously not cacti and it I'm not
sure<00:01:04.350> exactly<00:01:04.680> what<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.430> just<00:01:06.229> the<00:01:07.229> first

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
sure exactly what it is I just the first

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.450 
sure exactly what it is I just the first
time<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:07.950> saw<00:01:08.250> them<00:01:08.640> I've<00:01:09.080> started<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.460> really

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
time I saw them I've started to really

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.109 
time I saw them I've started to really
like<00:01:11.760> them<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.450> guess<00:01:12.780> because<00:01:13.170> they<00:01:13.350> are

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
like them I guess because they are

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:19.219 
like them I guess because they are
somehow<00:01:15.119> quite<00:01:15.750> human<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.770> don't<00:01:17.460> know<00:01:18.229> and

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
somehow quite human I don't know and

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.929 
somehow quite human I don't know and
also<00:01:21.350> the<00:01:22.350> fact<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.740> they're<00:01:23.009> usually<00:01:23.220> kind

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
also the fact that they're usually kind

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.859 
also the fact that they're usually kind
of<00:01:24.119> green<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.470> maybe<00:01:26.250> not<00:01:26.549> necessarily

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
of green and maybe not necessarily

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.260 
of green and maybe not necessarily
beautiful<00:01:28.009> when<00:01:29.009> they<00:01:29.159> flower<00:01:29.490> they're<00:01:30.060> just

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
beautiful when they flower they're just

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.789 
beautiful when they flower they're just
completely<00:01:30.930> different<00:01:32.750> it's<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.840> bit<00:01:34.049> it's<00:01:34.650> a

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
completely different it's a bit it's a

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.859
