you

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:13.700 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.850 

this<00:00:14.700> is<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.940> aeg<00:00:15.299> punch<00:00:15.570> cut<00:00:15.750> saw<00:00:15.959> the<00:00:16.620> reason

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:16.860 
this is the aeg punch cut saw the reason

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.020 
this is the aeg punch cut saw the reason
it's<00:00:16.980> called<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.190> punch<00:00:17.460> book<00:00:17.640> store<00:00:17.850> is

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:18.030 
it's called the punch book store is

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.850 
it's called the punch book store is
because<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.510> blade<00:00:18.690> is<00:00:18.720> situated<00:00:19.380> above<00:00:19.650> the

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:19.860 
because the blade is situated above the

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.830 
because the blade is situated above the
base<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.700> when<00:00:20.910> you<00:00:21.000> tilt<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:21.390> forward<00:00:21.420> like

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
base and when you tilt it forward like

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.050 
base and when you tilt it forward like
that<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.860> plunges<00:00:23.220> in<00:00:23.340> through<00:00:23.520> the<00:00:23.640> material

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
that it plunges in through the material

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.450 
that it plunges in through the material
the<00:00:24.930> riving<00:00:25.290> knife<00:00:25.320> is<00:00:25.560> spring-loaded<00:00:25.830> so

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
the riving knife is spring-loaded so

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.910 
the riving knife is spring-loaded so
that<00:00:26.580> moves<00:00:26.820> out<00:00:27.000> of<00:00:27.030> the<00:00:27.180> way<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.830> what<00:00:28.830> it

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
that moves out of the way and what it

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.860 
that moves out of the way and what it
means<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.580> if<00:00:29.820> you're<00:00:30.360> working<00:00:30.390> in

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:30.870 
means is is that if you're working in

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.680 
means is is that if you're working in
kitchen<00:00:31.740> worktop<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:32.969> want<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.329> cut<00:00:33.510> out

and 90% of the time you would use the

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:54.259 
and 90% of the time you would use the
saw<00:00:51.989> on<00:00:52.319> a<00:00:52.649> rail<00:00:52.949> like<00:00:53.190> this<00:00:53.219> kyle<00:00:53.879> minium

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:54.269 
saw on a rail like this kyle minium

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:56.959 
saw on a rail like this kyle minium
guide<00:00:54.480> rail<00:00:54.890> the<00:00:55.890> saw<00:00:56.100> will<00:00:56.280> run<00:00:56.460> i'll<00:00:56.550> put<00:00:56.699> key

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
guide rail the saw will run i'll put key

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.489 
guide rail the saw will run i'll put key
to<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.300> guide<00:00:57.659> rail<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.050> run<00:00:58.170> up<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.469> down

00:00:58.489 --> 00:00:58.499 
to the guide rail and run up and down

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:01.910 
to the guide rail and run up and down
there<00:00:58.969> on<00:00:59.969> top<00:01:00.659> of<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.870> rail<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.499> find<00:01:01.769> these

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
there on top of the rail you find these

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.340 
there on top of the rail you find these
low<00:01:02.249> friction<00:01:02.579> strips<00:01:03.179> and<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:03.989> makes<00:01:04.199> the

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
low friction strips and that makes the

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.690 
low friction strips and that makes the
soil<00:01:04.559> run<00:01:04.800> up<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.040> down<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.309> very<00:01:05.519> very

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
soil run up and down it very very

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.780 
soil run up and down it very very
smoothly<00:01:06.060> on<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.290> back<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.620> the<00:01:07.710> rail<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.610> to

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
smoothly on the back of the rail is to

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.639 
smoothly on the back of the rail is to
find<00:01:09.000> these<00:01:09.120> high<00:01:09.299> friction<00:01:09.509> strips<00:01:10.020> which

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 
find these high friction strips which

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:12.469 
find these high friction strips which
means<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.399> the<00:01:11.490> rail<00:01:11.670> will<00:01:11.909> stick<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.390> the

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
means that the rail will stick to the

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.950 
means that the rail will stick to the
workpiece<00:01:13.040> very<00:01:14.040> easily<00:01:14.420> when<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.509> first<00:01:15.719> get

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
workpiece very easily when you first get

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.080 
workpiece very easily when you first get
the<00:01:16.110> rail<00:01:16.290> you'll<00:01:17.219> notice<00:01:17.549> that<00:01:17.700> this<00:01:17.820> rubber

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
the rail you'll notice that this rubber

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.359 
the rail you'll notice that this rubber
strip<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.780> quite<00:01:19.140> long<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.979> what<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.219> have

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
strip is is quite long and what you have

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.980 
strip is is quite long and what you have
to<00:01:20.520> do<00:01:20.700> is<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.360> have<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.509> put<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.780> saw<00:01:21.960> on

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
to do is you have to put the saw on

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.870 
to do is you have to put the saw on
there<00:01:22.380> set<00:01:22.829> the<00:01:22.979> depth<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.250> about<00:01:23.579> five

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
there set the depth to about five

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.029 
there set the depth to about five
millimeters<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.659> just<00:01:24.990> cut<00:01:25.229> this<00:01:25.409> strip<00:01:25.829> off

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
millimeters and just cut this strip off

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:29.300 
millimeters and just cut this strip off
got<00:01:26.969> that<00:01:27.119> doors<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.600> keys<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.350> saw<00:01:28.649> to<00:01:29.159> this

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
got that doors it keys this saw to this

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.999 
got that doors it keys this saw to this
rail<00:01:29.640> okay<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.200> means<00:01:31.469> that<00:01:31.740> wherever

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
rail okay and that means that wherever

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.819 
rail okay and that means that wherever
the<00:01:33.000> edge<00:01:33.149> of<00:01:33.360> this<00:01:33.509> strip<00:01:33.869> is<00:01:33.899> is<00:01:34.320> where<00:01:34.710> you

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
the edge of this strip is is where you

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.580 
the edge of this strip is is where you
talk<00:01:35.100> now<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.909> benefit<00:01:36.359> of<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:37.500> that

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
talk now the benefit of that is is that

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.990 
talk now the benefit of that is is that
you<00:01:37.770> can<00:01:38.009> make<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.159> mark<00:01:38.490> on<00:01:38.640> your<00:01:38.759> material

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
you can make a mark on your material

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.120 
you can make a mark on your material
here<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.630> here<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.500> can<00:01:40.649> just<00:01:40.829> line<00:01:41.100> it

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
here and here and you can just line it

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.770 
here and here and you can just line it
up<00:01:42.229> put<00:01:43.229> your<00:01:43.320> saw<00:01:43.530> on<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.829> top<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:45.060> make<00:01:45.659> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
up put your saw on the top and make the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.260 
up put your saw on the top and make the
call<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:46.950> takes<00:01:47.280> about<00:01:47.399> 30<00:01:47.759> seconds<00:01:48.149> to

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
call and that takes about 30 seconds to

00:01:48.270 --> 00:02:02.899 
call and that takes about 30 seconds to
set<00:01:48.479> up
