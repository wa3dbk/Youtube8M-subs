I<00:01:08.040> mean<00:01:08.220> we<00:01:08.369> did<00:01:08.549> this<00:01:08.670> because<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.560> just<00:01:10.560> wanted

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
I mean we did this because I just wanted

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.800 
I mean we did this because I just wanted
to<00:01:10.860> let<00:01:10.979> people<00:01:11.040> know<00:01:11.220> how<00:01:11.520> well<00:01:11.820> these<00:01:12.570> to

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
to let people know how well these to

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.710 
to let people know how well these to
perform<00:01:13.290> for<00:01:13.710> they're<00:01:14.700> not<00:01:14.850> for<00:01:15.390> center

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
perform for they're not for center

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.300 
perform for they're not for center
channel<00:01:15.869> they're<00:01:16.170> not<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.650> expensive<00:01:17.009> at

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
channel they're not that expensive at

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.929 
channel they're not that expensive at
all<00:01:19.100> this<00:01:20.100> thing<00:01:20.400> sounds<00:01:21.439> outstanding

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
all this thing sounds outstanding

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:25.039 
all this thing sounds outstanding
obviously<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.060> center<00:01:24.330> channel<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.689> pretty

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
obviously the center channel is pretty

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.200 
obviously the center channel is pretty
much<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.320> most<00:01:25.409> important<00:01:25.860> speaker<00:01:26.189> in<00:01:26.400> the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
much the most important speaker in the

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.170 
much the most important speaker in the
house<00:01:27.390> cuz<00:01:27.720> most<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.380> sound<00:01:28.619> comes<00:01:28.770> out<00:01:29.579> of

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
house cuz most of the sound comes out of

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.730 
house cuz most of the sound comes out of
that<00:01:30.950> if<00:01:31.950> you're<00:01:32.100> doing<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.369> surround<00:01:32.700> sound<00:01:33.740> so

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
that if you're doing a surround sound so

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.960 
that if you're doing a surround sound so
that's<00:01:34.950> them<00:01:35.280> there<00:01:36.890> it<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:38.070> much<00:01:38.430> smaller

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
that's them there it is much smaller

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.450 
that's them there it is much smaller
than<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.630> cs20<00:01:41.960> but<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.350> great<00:01:44.159> for

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
than the cs20 but this is great for

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.770 
than the cs20 but this is great for
smaller<00:01:45.119> rooms<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.990> had<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:46.740> when<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:47.009> first

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.470 
that's a great one this is this one well
there's<00:03:03.400> lower<00:03:03.610> grades<00:03:03.910> in<00:03:04.060> this<00:03:04.180> but<00:03:04.390> I'm

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
there's lower grades in this but I'm

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.700 
there's lower grades in this but I'm
another<00:03:04.630> thing<00:03:04.750> either<00:03:04.870> but<00:03:05.110> I<00:03:05.170> have<00:03:05.440> this<00:03:05.650> one

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
another thing either but I have this one

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.120 
another thing either but I have this one
which<00:03:06.220> is<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.550> PSF<00:03:07.420> series<00:03:07.840> and<00:03:08.140> then<00:03:08.920> there's

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
which is the PSF series and then there's

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.370 
which is the PSF series and then there's
the<00:03:09.250> RTI<00:03:09.640> series<00:03:10.120> which<00:03:10.360> I'm<00:03:10.900> thinking<00:03:11.290> about

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
the RTI series which I'm thinking about

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.320 
the RTI series which I'm thinking about
upgrading<00:03:11.860> to<00:03:12.130> anyhow<00:03:12.610> just<00:03:12.670> to<00:03:12.940> see<00:03:13.120> how<00:03:13.180> it

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
upgrading to anyhow just to see how it

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:19.350 
upgrading to anyhow just to see how it
sounds<00:03:13.360> buy<00:03:13.780> one<00:03:15.870> and<00:03:16.870> then<00:03:17.040> there's<00:03:18.040> the<00:03:18.400> it's

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
sounds buy one and then there's the it's

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.930 
sounds buy one and then there's the it's
actually<00:03:19.660> new<00:03:19.900> 4-pole<00:03:20.290> audio<00:03:20.800> it's<00:03:21.010> LSI<00:03:21.580> it's

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
actually new 4-pole audio it's LSI it's

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.890 
actually new 4-pole audio it's LSI it's
got<00:03:22.120> a<00:03:22.150> a<00:03:22.740> dome<00:03:23.740> tweeter<00:03:24.160> a<00:03:25.000> nice<00:03:25.540> mid-range

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
got a a dome tweeter a nice mid-range

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.330 
got a a dome tweeter a nice mid-range
and<00:03:26.470> still<00:03:26.920> two<00:03:27.610> dual<00:03:29.340> six-and-a-half

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
and still two dual six-and-a-half

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.270 
and still two dual six-and-a-half
drivers<00:03:31.000> but<00:03:31.870> if<00:03:31.960> you<00:03:32.080> look<00:03:32.350> to<00:03:32.710> give<00:03:33.130> you<00:03:33.250> a

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
drivers but if you look to give you a

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:41.120 
drivers but if you look to give you a
comparison<00:03:34.020> and<00:03:35.020> the<00:03:35.590> size<00:03:36.310> difference<00:03:39.960> so

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
comparison and the size difference so

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:47.490 
comparison and the size difference so
this<00:03:42.130> one<00:03:42.400> is<00:03:42.610> a<00:03:44.070> shorter<00:03:45.070> not<00:03:45.310> as<00:03:45.520> tall<00:03:46.470> cs10

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
this one is a shorter not as tall cs10

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.990 
this one is a shorter not as tall cs10
and<00:03:48.310> I<00:03:49.060> believe<00:03:49.420> it's<00:03:49.660> less<00:03:50.130> yes<00:03:51.130> and<00:03:51.580> it<00:03:51.850> is

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
and I believe it's less yes and it is

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:00.270 
and I believe it's less yes and it is
less<00:03:52.300> depth<00:03:53.790> but<00:03:54.790> inch<00:03:57.090> but<00:03:58.090> I<00:03:58.830> had<00:03:59.830> the

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
less depth but inch but I had the

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.170 
less depth but inch but I had the
suspended<00:04:01.210> and<00:04:02.020> really<00:04:02.830> for<00:04:03.400> being<00:04:03.640> a<00:04:03.850> center

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
suspended and really for being a center

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.660 
suspended and really for being a center
channel<00:04:04.210> it<00:04:04.660> really<00:04:04.690> wasn't<00:04:05.080> quite<00:04:05.440> a<00:04:05.770> hundred

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
channel it really wasn't quite a hundred

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.970 
channel it really wasn't quite a hundred
percent<00:04:06.910> for<00:04:07.300> the<00:04:07.390> room<00:04:07.600> I<00:04:07.750> have<00:04:07.990> that<00:04:08.890> I'm

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
percent for the room I have that I'm

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.710 
percent for the room I have that I'm
using<00:04:09.190> it<00:04:09.430> in<00:04:10.260> I<00:04:11.260> mean<00:04:12.040> I<00:04:12.160> would<00:04:12.280> say<00:04:12.490> I'm<00:04:13.300> using

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
using it in I mean I would say I'm using

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.520 
using it in I mean I would say I'm using
it's<00:04:14.530> an<00:04:14.710> unlike

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
it's an unlike

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:22.249 
it's an unlike
maybe<00:04:17.530> fifteen<00:04:18.400> by<00:04:18.780> eighteen<00:04:19.780> room<00:04:20.109> and<00:04:20.379> I<00:04:20.829> I

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:22.259 
maybe fifteen by eighteen room and I I

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:25.230 
maybe fifteen by eighteen room and I I
went<00:04:23.259> with<00:04:23.469> the<00:04:23.560> cs20<00:04:23.979> and<00:04:24.310> I'm<00:04:24.430> much<00:04:24.729> more

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
went with the cs20 and I'm much more

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.629 
went with the cs20 and I'm much more
happy<00:04:25.599> so<00:04:25.780> if<00:04:25.900> it's<00:04:26.020> a<00:04:26.110> small<00:04:26.379> room<00:04:26.639> then

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
happy so if it's a small room then

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.360 
happy so if it's a small room then
they're<00:04:28.599> smaller<00:04:28.900> than<00:04:29.110> that<00:04:29.259> go<00:04:29.650> at<00:04:29.770> the<00:04:29.860> cs10

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
they're smaller than that go at the cs10

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.170 
they're smaller than that go at the cs10
but<00:04:30.840> this<00:04:31.840> is<00:04:32.050> a<00:04:32.340> really<00:04:33.340> agreed<00:04:33.819> center

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
but this is a really agreed center

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.980 
but this is a really agreed center
channel<00:04:34.330> it's<00:04:34.629> very<00:04:35.430> clear<00:04:36.430> and<00:04:36.849> crisp<00:04:37.330> very

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
channel it's very clear and crisp very

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.869 
channel it's very clear and crisp very
balanced<00:04:39.479> and<00:04:40.710> again<00:04:41.710> if<00:04:41.889> you<00:04:42.009> especially<00:04:42.580> if

00:04:42.869 --> 00:04:42.879 
balanced and again if you especially if

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:44.670 
balanced and again if you especially if
you<00:04:42.939> don't<00:04:43.389> have<00:04:43.629> a<00:04:43.659> Saab<00:04:43.990> I<00:04:44.169> would<00:04:44.289> definitely

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
you don't have a Saab I would definitely

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.950 
you don't have a Saab I would definitely
go<00:04:44.740> with<00:04:44.770> the<00:04:44.889> cs20<00:04:45.490> with<00:04:45.849> the<00:04:46.030> dual<00:04:46.539> six<00:04:46.810> and<00:04:46.930> a

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
go with the cs20 with the dual six and a

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.230 
go with the cs20 with the dual six and a
half<00:04:46.990> drivers<00:04:47.530> it<00:04:48.129> does<00:04:48.430> make<00:04:48.639> it<00:04:48.789> a<00:04:48.879> fuller

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
half drivers it does make it a fuller

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.040 
half drivers it does make it a fuller
sound<00:04:49.689> compared<00:04:50.169> to<00:04:50.199> the<00:04:50.319> cs10<00:04:51.509> but<00:04:52.509> they<00:04:52.659> then

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
sound compared to the cs10 but they then

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.360 
sound compared to the cs10 but they then
again<00:04:53.289> you're<00:04:53.439> still<00:04:53.710> are<00:04:53.889> spending<00:04:54.219> more

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
again you're still are spending more

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.459 
again you're still are spending more
money<00:04:54.430> I<00:04:54.909> actually<00:04:55.419> can't<00:04:55.900> remember<00:04:56.199> what<00:04:56.439> I

money I actually can't remember what I

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:58.499 
money I actually can't remember what I
spent<00:04:56.830> for<00:04:57.069> him<00:04:57.189> but<00:04:57.370> I<00:04:57.610> got<00:04:58.090> him<00:04:58.240> off<00:04:58.389> to

00:04:58.499 --> 00:04:58.509 
spent for him but I got him off to

my<00:05:51.250> retired<00:05:51.699> center<00:05:52.180> channel<00:05:52.360> that's<00:05:52.719> I<00:05:53.339> had

my retired center channel that's I had

but it wasn't enough for what I wanted
wasn't<00:05:57.129> as<00:05:57.339> full<00:05:57.669> sound<00:05:58.029> but<00:05:58.240> it<00:05:58.360> again<00:05:58.839> it's

great but I think it's I think it's

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:04.050 
great but I think it's I think it's
around<00:06:01.659> a<00:06:01.839> hundred<00:06:01.930> dollars<00:06:02.110> cheaper<00:06:03.060> but

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
around a hundred dollars cheaper but

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 
a lot of people don't think it's really

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.990 
a lot of people don't think it's really
that<00:06:08.949> great<00:06:09.099> but<00:06:09.279> I<00:06:09.339> think<00:06:09.370> it's<00:06:09.639> great<00:06:09.819> I<00:06:09.909> mean
