00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:02.800 

from<00:00:01.140> the<00:00:01.199> time<00:00:01.380> I<00:00:01.410> got<00:00:01.530> my<00:00:01.680> car<00:00:02.040> I<00:00:02.070> had<00:00:02.399> to<00:00:02.429> code

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:02.810 
from the time I got my car I had to code

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:08.179 
from the time I got my car I had to code
po4<00:00:03.810> to<00:00:04.350> one<00:00:05.029> its<00:00:06.029> catalyst<00:00:06.629> blows<00:00:07.160> efficiency

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
po4 to one its catalyst blows efficiency

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.020 
po4 to one its catalyst blows efficiency
I<00:00:08.400> believe<00:00:09.300> Bank<00:00:09.599> one<00:00:09.809> and<00:00:10.580> all<00:00:11.580> it's<00:00:11.790> saying

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
I believe Bank one and all it's saying

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.289 
I believe Bank one and all it's saying
is<00:00:12.330> that<00:00:12.389> your<00:00:12.660> catalytic<00:00:13.320> converter<00:00:14.299> isn't

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
is that your catalytic converter isn't

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.650 
is that your catalytic converter isn't
operating<00:00:15.719> at<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.170> right<00:00:16.490> it's<00:00:17.490> not<00:00:17.760> getting

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
operating at the right it's not getting

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.439 
operating at the right it's not getting
all<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.930> toxins<00:00:19.859> out<00:00:20.039> when<00:00:20.640> it's<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:21.000> cold

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
all the toxins out when it's a cold

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:28.269 
all the toxins out when it's a cold
start<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.670> I<00:00:23.750> tried<00:00:24.750> changing<00:00:25.289> spark<00:00:25.710> plugs

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:36.010 

what<00:00:29.279> else<00:00:29.490> did<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:29.699> do

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.470 

changing<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.110> o2<00:00:37.290> sensors<00:00:38.059> you<00:00:39.059> can<00:00:39.210> test

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
changing the o2 sensors you can test

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.180 
changing the o2 sensors you can test
though<00:00:39.660> two<00:00:39.719> sensors<00:00:40.350> before<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.829> do<00:00:40.980> this

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
though two sensors before you do this

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.340 
though two sensors before you do this
but<00:00:42.379> yeah<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:44.280> have<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.520> 2011<00:00:45.059> product<00:00:45.600> Mazda

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
but yeah so I have a 2011 product Mazda

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.459 
but yeah so I have a 2011 product Mazda
Protege<00:00:46.739> here's<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:48.149> first<00:00:48.600> o2<00:00:49.079> sensor

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
Protege here's the first o2 sensor

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.139 
Protege here's the first o2 sensor
before<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.070> cat<00:00:51.170> under<00:00:52.170> here<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.789> two

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
before the cat under here is a two

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:01.220 
before the cat under here is a two
sensor<00:00:54.629> after<00:00:55.440> oh<00:00:56.480> yeah<00:00:58.219> right<00:00:59.219> there<00:00:59.579> and<00:01:00.230> my

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
sensor after oh yeah right there and my

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.500 
sensor after oh yeah right there and my
nightie<00:01:01.469> has<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:02.070> part<00:01:02.430> on<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.850> fixes<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:05.510> so

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
nightie has this part on it fixes it so

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.679 
nightie has this part on it fixes it so
after<00:01:07.260> you've<00:01:07.380> tested<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.490> two<00:01:09.030> sensors<00:01:09.479> with

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
after you've tested the two sensors with

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.210 
after you've tested the two sensors with
the<00:01:09.780> voltmeter<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.650> can<00:01:10.770> look<00:01:10.950> up<00:01:11.100> another

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
the voltmeter you can look up another

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.649 
the voltmeter you can look up another
video<00:01:11.580> for<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:12.110> and<00:01:13.430> that<00:01:14.430> doesn't<00:01:14.790> work<00:01:14.970> and

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
video for that and that doesn't work and

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.050 
video for that and that doesn't work and
your<00:01:15.869> cheese<00:01:16.439> sensors<00:01:16.830> fine<00:01:17.100> you're<00:01:17.850> going<00:01:18.000> to

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
your cheese sensors fine you're going to

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.370 
your cheese sensors fine you're going to
want<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.710> get<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.740> spark<00:01:20.070> plug<00:01:20.159> nan<00:01:20.670> Fowler<00:01:21.380> it's

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
want to get a spark plug nan Fowler it's

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.070 
want to get a spark plug nan Fowler it's
actually<00:01:22.920> only<00:01:23.159> like<00:01:23.310> 2<00:01:23.520> or<00:01:23.640> 3<00:01:23.850> bucks<00:01:24.080> turns

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
actually only like 2 or 3 bucks turns

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.010 
actually only like 2 or 3 bucks turns
off<00:01:25.259> your<00:01:25.409> check<00:01:25.650> engine<00:01:25.860> light<00:01:26.390> it<00:01:27.390> pulls<00:01:27.840> the

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
off your check engine light it pulls the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.200 
off your check engine light it pulls the
o2<00:01:28.259> sensor<00:01:28.680> away<00:01:29.100> from<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.549> fumes<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.119> it

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
o2 sensor away from the fumes so it

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.090 
o2 sensor away from the fumes so it
doesn't<00:01:30.450> read<00:01:30.630> them<00:01:30.780> so<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:31.680> can<00:01:31.770> go<00:01:31.890> pass

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
doesn't read them so you can go pass

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.690 
doesn't read them so you can go pass
smog<00:01:32.540> and<00:01:33.540> originally<00:01:34.470> these<00:01:35.280> are<00:01:35.460> not<00:01:35.670> a

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
smog and originally these are not a

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.190 
smog and originally these are not a
half-inch<00:01:36.329> so<00:01:36.630> you're<00:01:36.750> going<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:36.900> have<00:01:37.020> to

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
half-inch so you're going to have to

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.249 
half-inch so you're going to have to
drill<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.680> out<00:01:38.570> using<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.780> drill<00:01:40.020> bit<00:01:40.229> or

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
drill it out using a drill bit or

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.080 
drill it out using a drill bit or
something<00:01:40.890> half-inch<00:01:43.009> and<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.700> drill<00:01:44.939> that

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
something half-inch and you drill that

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.710 
something half-inch and you drill that
out<00:01:45.710> and<00:01:46.710> then<00:01:47.009> you're<00:01:47.220> going<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.659> screw<00:01:48.659> in

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
out and then you're going to screw in

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.749 
out and then you're going to screw in
your<00:01:48.899> o2<00:01:49.020> sensor<00:01:49.229> -<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.920> fits<00:01:50.189> right<00:01:50.399> in<00:01:50.579> there

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
your o2 sensor - it fits right in there

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.620 
your o2 sensor - it fits right in there
then<00:01:51.750> screw<00:01:52.140> this<00:01:52.290> into<00:01:52.530> your<00:01:52.680> exhaust<00:01:53.070> and

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
then screw this into your exhaust and

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.899 
then screw this into your exhaust and
the<00:01:54.630> Cubs<00:01:54.869> gone<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:56.070> took<00:01:56.310> me<00:01:56.460> two<00:01:56.610> years<00:01:56.790> to

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
the Cubs gone it took me two years to

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.670 
the Cubs gone it took me two years to
figure<00:01:57.119> that<00:01:57.240> out<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:58.140> just<00:01:58.170> thought<00:01:58.500> I'd

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
figure that out and I just thought I'd

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.310 
figure that out and I just thought I'd
share<00:01:58.920> with<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.100> guys
