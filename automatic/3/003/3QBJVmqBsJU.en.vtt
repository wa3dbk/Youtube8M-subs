00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.020 
thoroughly made makes them excited with
anticipation<00:00:34.040> before<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.280> developer<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:36.000> a

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
anticipation before a developer is a

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.360 
anticipation before a developer is a
hurdle<00:00:36.420> we<00:00:36.540> have<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.809> overcome<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.980> number<00:00:38.280> of

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
hurdle we have to overcome the number of

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.619 
hurdle we have to overcome the number of
things<00:00:38.579> we<00:00:38.730> have<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.030> do<00:00:39.180> keeps<00:00:39.450> increasing

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
things we have to do keeps increasing

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.540 
things we have to do keeps increasing
and<00:00:40.170> if<00:00:40.290> we<00:00:40.410> keep<00:00:40.559> trying<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.980> expand<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.430> as

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
and if we keep trying to expand it as

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.760 
and if we keep trying to expand it as
far<00:00:41.700> as<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:42.030> will<00:00:42.149> go<00:00:42.210> will<00:00:43.170> never<00:00:43.379> be<00:00:43.559> finished

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
far as it will go will never be finished

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.319 
far as it will go will never be finished
I<00:00:44.129> think<00:00:44.520> we're<00:00:44.640> going<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.850> end<00:00:44.969> up<00:00:45.090> being

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
I think we're going to end up being

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.610 
I think we're going to end up being
faced<00:00:45.539> with<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.780> choice<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.170> what<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.350> keep

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620

faced with the choice of what to keep
and<00:00:46.770> what<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.950> give<00:00:47.190> up<00:00:47.370> on<00:00:47.550> for<00:00:47.789> Kingdom

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030

he's saying with the new console in this

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.000 
he's saying with the new console in this
case<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.430> ps4<00:01:11.700> he<00:01:12.090> has<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.240> lot<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.680> room<00:01:13.680> to

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
case the ps4 he has a lot of room to

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.510 
case the ps4 he has a lot of room to
like<00:01:14.310> basically<00:01:14.760> make<00:01:15.390> whatever<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.960> want

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
like basically make whatever you want

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.490 
like basically make whatever you want
but<00:01:17.520> um<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:18.390> make<00:01:18.570> everything<00:01:18.869> so<00:01:19.049> thorough

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
but um to make everything so thorough

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.560 
but um to make everything so thorough
and<00:01:19.860> well<00:01:20.070> made<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.640> will<00:01:20.909> take<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.150> lot<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.450> time

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
and well made it will take a lot of time

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.760 
and well made it will take a lot of time
and<00:01:22.909> he's<00:01:23.909> thinking<00:01:24.270> about<00:01:24.390> maybe<00:01:25.170> they'll

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
and he's thinking about maybe they'll

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.670 
and he's thinking about maybe they'll
have<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.040> cut<00:01:26.340> some<00:01:26.640> content<00:01:27.350> because<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.530> this

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
have to cut some content because of this

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.310 
have to cut some content because of this
or<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.460> kingdom<00:01:30.000> RC<00:01:30.329> will<00:01:30.479> just<00:01:30.659> take<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:31.049> too

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
or a kingdom RC will just take to too

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.749 
or a kingdom RC will just take to too
long<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.829> we<00:01:31.920> already<00:01:32.040> know<00:01:32.250> it's<00:01:32.400> gonna<00:01:32.490> take

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
long and we already know it's gonna take

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.870 
long and we already know it's gonna take
a<00:01:32.790> long<00:01:33.000> time<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:33.799> maybe<00:01:34.799> he's<00:01:35.520> thinking<00:01:35.670> about

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
a long time so maybe he's thinking about

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.730 
a long time so maybe he's thinking about
cutting<00:01:36.150> out<00:01:36.360> some<00:01:36.540> content<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.320> this<00:01:37.530> makes

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
cutting out some content and this makes

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.770 
cutting out some content and this makes
me<00:01:37.920> think<00:01:38.189> maybe<00:01:38.400> they're<00:01:39.390> gonna<00:01:39.509> make<00:01:39.750> a

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
me think maybe they're gonna make a

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.080 
me think maybe they're gonna make a
kingdom<00:01:40.140> hearts<00:01:40.470> 3<00:01:40.740> final<00:01:41.159> mix<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.759> in

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
kingdom hearts 3 final mix and in

feel like it's gonna be different from

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.590 
feel like it's gonna be different from
the<00:02:01.590> rest<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:01.950> final<00:02:02.280> mixes<00:02:02.640> since<00:02:02.880> this

the rest of the final mixes since this

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.600 
the rest of the final mixes since this
is<00:02:03.810> on<00:02:03.990> like<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.229> new<00:02:04.439> generation<00:02:04.829> of<00:02:05.130> consoles

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
if it does get made I'm saying it will

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
if it does get made I'm saying it will

was not bringing the final mixes to
North<00:02:23.879> America<00:02:24.450> so<00:02:25.019> I<00:02:25.050> believe<00:02:25.470> yes<00:02:25.800> it<00:02:26.129> will

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
North America so I believe yes it will

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.360 
North America so I believe yes it will
definitely<00:02:27.090> come<00:02:27.330> to<00:02:27.360> North<00:02:27.690> America<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:28.370> I

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
definitely come to North America and I

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.850 
definitely come to North America and I
believe<00:02:29.910> that<00:02:30.269> it's<00:02:30.540> actually<00:02:31.170> going<00:02:31.739> to<00:02:31.830> be

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
believe that it's actually going to be

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.300 
believe that it's actually going to be
released<00:02:32.340> in<00:02:32.550> a<00:02:32.640> form<00:02:32.940> of<00:02:33.680> DLC<00:02:34.680> so<00:02:34.980> it<00:02:35.160> will

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
released in a form of DLC so it will

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.979 
released in a form of DLC so it will
probably<00:02:35.519> be<00:02:35.700> like<00:02:35.970> up<00:02:36.150> on<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.450> playstation

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
kingdom hearts ii final mix you don't

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.119 
kingdom hearts ii final mix you don't
have<00:02:42.330> to<00:02:42.450> go<00:02:42.599> buy<00:02:42.780> up<00:02:42.959> out<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:43.230> buy<00:02:43.650> a<00:02:43.680> new<00:02:43.920> game

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
have to go buy up out and buy a new game

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.880 
have to go buy up out and buy a new game
but<00:02:44.549> there<00:02:44.670> probably<00:02:44.910> will<00:02:45.180> release<00:02:45.540> it<00:02:45.890> in

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
but there probably will release it in

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.550 
but there probably will release it in
boxes<00:02:47.160> as<00:02:47.549> well<00:02:47.790> so<00:02:48.180> this<00:02:48.690> is<00:02:48.900> if<00:02:49.080> they<00:02:49.319> cut

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
boxes as well so this is if they cut

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.170 
boxes as well so this is if they cut
some<00:02:49.739> content<00:02:50.220> I<00:02:50.310> feel<00:02:50.610> like<00:02:50.819> they<00:02:50.970> have<00:02:51.000> a

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
some content I feel like they have a

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.050 
some content I feel like they have a
powerful<00:02:51.630> enough<00:02:52.049> console<00:02:52.560> now<00:02:52.829> that<00:02:53.700> they'll

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
powerful enough console now that they'll

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.759 
powerful enough console now that they'll
be<00:02:54.150> able<00:02:54.269> to<00:02:54.569> make<00:02:54.720> like<00:02:55.019> whatever<00:02:55.560> their

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
be able to make like whatever their

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.470 
be able to make like whatever their
wildest<00:02:56.250> dreams<00:02:56.250> are<00:02:56.880> and<00:02:57.410> pretty<00:02:58.410> much<00:02:58.500> not

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
wildest dreams are and pretty much not

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.140 
wildest dreams are and pretty much not
worry<00:03:00.480> about<00:03:00.569> power<00:03:01.049> but<00:03:01.860> and<00:03:02.160> I<00:03:02.849> guess

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
worry about power but and I guess

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.699 
worry about power but and I guess
they're<00:03:03.660> worrying<00:03:03.870> about<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.260> time<00:03:04.470> that<00:03:04.650> it

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
they're worrying about the time that it

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.559 
they're worrying about the time that it
makes<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.760> time<00:03:05.940> that<00:03:06.120> it<00:03:06.209> takes<00:03:06.329> to<00:03:06.480> make

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
makes the time that it takes to make

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.949 
makes the time that it takes to make
something<00:03:06.989> so<00:03:07.459> big<00:03:08.459> so<00:03:08.940> yeah<00:03:09.540> that's<00:03:09.720> just

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959
