NBA<00:01:45.750> looking<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.470> your<00:01:46.590> officials<00:01:47.040> they<00:01:47.490> are

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
NBA looking to your officials they are

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.940 
NBA looking to your officials they are
horrible<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:49.079> really<00:01:49.350> do<00:01:49.470> think<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.799> the

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
horrible and I really do think that the

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.679 
horrible and I really do think that the
NBA<00:01:50.189> just<00:01:50.430> does<00:01:50.670> not<00:01:50.850> like<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.210> Blazers<00:01:51.540> now

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
NBA just does not like the Blazers now

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:52.789 
NBA just does not like the Blazers now
why<00:01:51.810> would<00:01:51.930> they<00:01:52.020> not<00:01:52.170> like<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.350> Blazers

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
why would they not like the Blazers

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.830 
why would they not like the Blazers
that's<00:01:53.549> because<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.880> Blazers<00:01:54.180> don't<00:01:54.479> like<00:01:54.689> to

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
that's because the Blazers don't like to

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.270 
that's because the Blazers don't like to
do<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:54.960> lot<00:01:55.170> of<00:01:55.200> big<00:01:55.439> advertising<00:01:55.890> they<00:01:56.130> don't

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
do a lot of big advertising they don't

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.830 
do a lot of big advertising they don't
really<00:01:56.399> give<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.000> NBA<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.329> lot<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.659> money

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
really give the NBA a lot of money

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.510 
really give the NBA a lot of money
because<00:01:58.530> they<00:01:58.799> do<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.950> lot<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.159> local

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
because they do a lot of local

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.039 
because they do a lot of local
advertising<00:01:59.850> they<00:02:00.060> prefer<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.420> advertise

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
advertising they prefer to advertise
