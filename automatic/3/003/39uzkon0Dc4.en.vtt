00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
with auto or you figure they get up for

with auto or you figure they get up for
that<00:00:12.750> and<00:00:12.780> then<00:00:13.049> Carolina<00:00:13.650> I<00:00:13.950> mean<00:00:14.370> this<00:00:14.429> is

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
that and then Carolina I mean this is

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.519 
that and then Carolina I mean this is
brutal<00:00:14.759> right<00:00:15.000> now<00:00:15.179> yeah<00:00:15.690> I<00:00:15.719> mean<00:00:16.230> it's

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
brutal right now yeah I mean it's

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:17.840 
brutal right now yeah I mean it's
basically<00:00:16.859> they're<00:00:17.220> in<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.369> downward<00:00:17.580> spiral

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
basically they're in a downward spiral

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.790 
basically they're in a downward spiral
right<00:00:18.240> now<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.630> you<00:00:19.109> know<00:00:19.199> it<00:00:19.320> seems<00:00:19.529> like<00:00:19.680> the

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
right now and you know it seems like the

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.349 
right now and you know it seems like the
roof<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.100> collapsing<00:00:20.640> because<00:00:20.760> it<00:00:21.000> is<00:00:21.150> right

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
roof is collapsing because it is right

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.670 
roof is collapsing because it is right
now<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:21.750> think<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.050> Bruins<00:00:22.350> really<00:00:22.560> need

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
now and I think the Bruins really need

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.990 
now and I think the Bruins really need
to<00:00:22.769> just<00:00:22.830> sort<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.130> step<00:00:23.400> back<00:00:23.640> take<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.910> deep

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
to just sort of step back take a deep

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.509 
to just sort of step back take a deep
breath<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.960> just<00:00:25.529> get<00:00:25.680> back<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:26.010> basics<00:00:26.220> I

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
breath and and just get back to basics I

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.519 
breath and and just get back to basics I
know<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:26.849> sounds<00:00:27.330> like<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.570> cliche<00:00:28.050> but<00:00:28.260> that's

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
know it sounds like a cliche but that's

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:29.870 
know it sounds like a cliche but that's
exactly<00:00:28.949> what<00:00:29.099> they<00:00:29.220> have<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.429> do<00:00:29.550> they<00:00:29.699> need

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
exactly what they have to do they need

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.640 
exactly what they have to do they need
to<00:00:30.029> simplify<00:00:30.390> things<00:00:30.599> right<00:00:30.990> now<00:00:31.140> they<00:00:31.619> need

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
to simplify things right now they need

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.590 
to simplify things right now they need
to<00:00:31.949> realize<00:00:32.250> what<00:00:32.279> cut<00:00:32.730> them<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.149> top<00:00:33.300> spot

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600
