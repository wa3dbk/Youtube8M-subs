00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.310 
an instrument you know there's all these
steps<00:02:09.850> things<00:02:10.210> have<00:02:10.360> to<00:02:10.479> be<00:02:10.600> cut<00:02:10.840> and<00:02:11.080> glued

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
steps things have to be cut and glued

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.710 
steps things have to be cut and glued
and<00:02:11.620> and<00:02:11.860> have<00:02:12.580> to<00:02:12.760> sit<00:02:13.030> and<00:02:13.240> some<00:02:13.420> things<00:02:13.630> have

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
and and have to sit and some things have

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.820 
and and have to sit and some things have
to<00:02:13.870> be<00:02:14.350> drilled<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:15.460> set<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:16.560> so<00:02:17.560> that's

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
to be drilled and set and so that's

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.890 
to be drilled and set and so that's
that's<00:02:17.920> a<00:02:18.190> major<00:02:18.370> step<00:02:18.580> it<00:02:19.330> all<00:02:19.420> has<00:02:19.600> to<00:02:19.630> look

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
that's a major step it all has to look

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.410 
that's a major step it all has to look
nice<00:02:20.680> it's<00:02:21.550> gonna<00:02:21.730> if<00:02:21.910> it's<00:02:22.060> gonna<00:02:22.180> be<00:02:22.360> in

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
nice it's gonna if it's gonna be in

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.240 
nice it's gonna if it's gonna be in
somebody's<00:02:22.630> living<00:02:22.930> room<00:02:23.230> it<00:02:23.860> might<00:02:24.100> as<00:02:24.220> well

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
somebody's living room it might as well

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.870 
somebody's living room it might as well
be<00:02:24.960> appealing<00:02:25.960> and<00:02:26.200> pretty<00:02:26.670> believe<00:02:27.670> it<00:02:27.790> or

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
be appealing and pretty believe it or

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.940 
be appealing and pretty believe it or
not<00:02:27.970> this<00:02:28.180> is<00:02:28.390> where<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.350> head<00:02:29.500> is<00:02:29.530> derived

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
not this is where the head is derived

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.940 
not this is where the head is derived
from<00:02:30.070> is<00:02:30.370> a<00:02:30.400> block<00:02:30.670> of<00:02:30.850> wood<00:02:30.880> like<00:02:31.150> this<00:02:31.210> and

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
from is a block of wood like this and

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.260 
from is a block of wood like this and
these<00:02:32.950> are<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.220> cheek<00:02:33.490> pieces<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:34.000> this<00:02:34.090> is

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
these are the cheek pieces and this is

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.390 
these are the cheek pieces and this is
all<00:02:34.390> glued<00:02:34.660> up<00:02:34.840> ends<00:02:35.620> up<00:02:35.710> being<00:02:35.860> five<00:02:36.130> pieces

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
all glued up ends up being five pieces

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.030 
all glued up ends up being five pieces
of<00:02:36.550> wood<00:02:36.820> glued<00:02:37.090> and<00:02:37.240> clamped<00:02:37.270> and<00:02:37.750> it<00:02:38.680> reaches

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
of wood glued and clamped and it reaches

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.970 
of wood glued and clamped and it reaches
this<00:02:39.220> stage<00:02:39.280> and<00:02:40.260> which<00:02:41.260> doesn't<00:02:41.680> seem<00:02:41.830> to

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
this stage and which doesn't seem to

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.410 
this stage and which doesn't seem to
look<00:02:42.100> like<00:02:42.160> much<00:02:42.550> because<00:02:42.940> of<00:02:43.090> it<00:02:43.180> really

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
look like much because of it really

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.650 
look like much because of it really
isn't<00:02:43.570> much<00:02:43.840> it's<00:02:44.050> kind<00:02:44.200> of<00:02:44.320> ugly<00:02:44.440> and<00:02:45.660> from

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
isn't much it's kind of ugly and from

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.310 
isn't much it's kind of ugly and from
this<00:02:46.810> point<00:02:47.080> I<00:02:47.380> I<00:02:48.480> cut<00:02:49.480> it<00:02:49.570> all<00:02:49.690> up<00:02:49.720> and<00:02:50.080> in

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
this point I I cut it all up and in

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.980 
this point I I cut it all up and in
sculpturing<00:02:51.100> and<00:02:52.060> this<00:02:52.270> is<00:02:52.420> what<00:02:52.600> it<00:02:52.690> ends<00:02:52.930> up

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
sculpturing and this is what it ends up

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:59.040 
sculpturing and this is what it ends up
being<00:02:53.430> is<00:02:54.430> a<00:02:54.910> horse<00:02:57.390> besides<00:02:58.390> being<00:02:58.690> a<00:02:58.840> tool

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
being is a horse besides being a tool

for recuperating jockeys the exerciser

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.630 
for recuperating jockeys the exerciser
is<00:03:02.020> a<00:03:02.050> valuable<00:03:02.500> training<00:03:02.980> device<00:03:03.250> for<00:03:03.580> the

tight<00:03:16.810> I<00:03:17.110> hope<00:03:17.980> that<00:03:18.160> it<00:03:18.280> improves<00:03:18.670> racing<00:03:19.090> and

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
tight I hope that it improves racing and

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:20.880 
tight I hope that it improves racing and
I<00:03:19.239> think<00:03:19.450> it<00:03:19.570> will<00:03:19.720> because<00:03:20.440> it's<00:03:20.620> gonna<00:03:20.769> make

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
I think it will because it's gonna make

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.250 
I think it will because it's gonna make
better<00:03:21.280> jockeys<00:03:21.820> the<00:03:22.150> younger<00:03:22.720> generation

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
better jockeys the younger generation

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.380 
better jockeys the younger generation
kids<00:03:23.500> that<00:03:23.739> have<00:03:23.920> these<00:03:24.130> things<00:03:24.340> it's<00:03:25.150> going

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
kids that have these things it's going

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.729 
kids that have these things it's going
to<00:03:25.450> be<00:03:25.570> a<00:03:25.600> big<00:03:25.840> advantage<00:03:26.140> for<00:03:26.470> them<00:03:26.590> and

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
to be a big advantage for them and

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.890 
to be a big advantage for them and
they're<00:03:27.280> going<00:03:27.400> to<00:03:27.489> be<00:03:27.610> able<00:03:27.700> to<00:03:27.940> practice<00:03:28.720> and

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
they're going to be able to practice and

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.830

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
they get on the on the racetrack it's a

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:35.740 
they get on the on the racetrack it's a
new<00:03:34.390> concept<00:03:34.570> there<00:03:35.019> too

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
new concept there too

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.940 
new concept there too
I<00:03:35.780> hope<00:03:36.320> then<00:03:36.530> I<00:03:36.890> think<00:03:37.580> it'll<00:03:37.730> improve<00:03:38.000> racing

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
I hope then I think it'll improve racing
