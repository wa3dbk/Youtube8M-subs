I<00:00:20.359> have<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.539> say<00:00:21.779> that<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.380> was<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.560> great

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
I have to say that it was a great

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.240 
I have to say that it was a great
experience<00:00:23.640> working<00:00:23.970> with<00:00:24.539> B&amp;W<00:00:24.810> design<00:00:25.590> so

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
experience working with B&amp;W design so

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.240 
experience working with B&amp;W design so
they<00:00:26.430> gave<00:00:26.640> us<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:27.359> total<00:00:27.899> freedom<00:00:28.439> for

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
they gave us a total freedom for

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.089 
they gave us a total freedom for
creativity<00:00:29.939> because<00:00:30.149> they're<00:00:30.660> really

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
creativity because they're really

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.400 
creativity because they're really
trusted<00:00:32.099> our<00:00:32.390> skill<00:00:33.390> our<00:00:33.540> capacity<00:00:34.320> of

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
trusted our skill our capacity of

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.090 
trusted our skill our capacity of
interpreting<00:00:35.160> their<00:00:36.260> design<00:00:37.260> identity<00:00:38.010> and

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
interpreting their design identity and

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.790 
interpreting their design identity and
the<00:00:38.190> design<00:00:38.610> values<00:00:39.420> they<00:00:39.960> know<00:00:40.170> exactly<00:00:40.320> what

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
the design values they know exactly what

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.759 
the design values they know exactly what
is<00:00:40.980> B&amp;W<00:00:41.430> what<00:00:41.940> has<00:00:42.089> been<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.900> w<00:00:43.290> design<00:00:43.620> on

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:43.769 
is B&amp;W what has been in w design on

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:46.579 
is B&amp;W what has been in w design on
Easter<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.159> how<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.489> will<00:00:44.640> become<00:00:45.470> but<00:00:46.470> they

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:46.589 
Easter and how it will become but they

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:49.310 
Easter and how it will become but they
really<00:00:46.739> wanted<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:47.270> have<00:00:48.270> an<00:00:48.420> experiment<00:00:49.050> and

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
really wanted to have an experiment and

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.959 
really wanted to have an experiment and
say<00:00:49.590> let's<00:00:50.520> see<00:00:50.760> what<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:52.370> worldwide<00:00:53.370> recognize

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
say let's see what a worldwide recognize

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.389 
say let's see what a worldwide recognize
design<00:00:54.750> film<00:00:55.079> like<00:00:55.230> pininfarina<00:00:55.890> with<00:00:56.160> this

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
design film like pininfarina with this

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.119 
design film like pininfarina with this
typical<00:00:57.300> philosophy<00:00:57.899> based<00:00:58.079> on<00:00:58.379> purity<00:00:59.010> on

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
typical philosophy based on purity on

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.999 
typical philosophy based on purity on
elegance<00:00:59.579> could<00:00:59.910> do<00:01:00.379> associated<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.590> club<00:01:02.370> B&amp;W

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
elegance could do associated to club B&amp;W

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:08.570 
elegance could do associated to club B&amp;W
design<00:01:05.420> approach<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.229> was<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.410> pinin<00:01:08.100> farina

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
design approach so it was a pinin farina

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.550 
design approach so it was a pinin farina
lad<00:01:09.259> design<00:01:10.259> and<00:01:10.530> they<00:01:11.369> just<00:01:11.670> participate

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
lad design and they just participate

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.270 
lad design and they just participate
from<00:01:13.560> time<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.070> time<00:01:14.240> just<00:01:15.240> by<00:01:15.390> making<00:01:15.690> sure

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
from time to time just by making sure

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.400 
from time to time just by making sure
that<00:01:17.280> what<00:01:17.520> we<00:01:17.550> were<00:01:17.850> doing<00:01:18.149> was<00:01:18.479> not<00:01:18.899> going

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:19.410 
that what we were doing was not going

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.270 
that what we were doing was not going
against<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:21.150> B&amp;W<00:01:21.540> identity<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:22.439> they'll<00:01:22.590> let

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
against the B&amp;W identity so they'll let

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.969 
against the B&amp;W identity so they'll let
us<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.640> maximum<00:01:23.909> freedom<00:01:24.570> as<00:01:25.200> far<00:01:25.650> as<00:01:25.799> we

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
us the maximum freedom as far as we

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.130 
us the maximum freedom as far as we
could<00:01:26.280> keep<00:01:26.549> inside<00:01:27.270> what<00:01:27.600> they<00:01:27.750> would<00:01:27.930> still

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
could keep inside what they would still

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.200 
could keep inside what they would still
recognize<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.710> B&amp;W<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.790> one<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.000> the

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
recognize a B&amp;W and one of the

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.999 
recognize a B&amp;W and one of the
interesting<00:01:30.259> discussion<00:01:31.259> we<00:01:31.380> had<00:01:31.590> with<00:01:31.829> other

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
interesting discussion we had with other

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.160 
interesting discussion we had with other
a<00:01:32.130> mono<00:01:32.399> dakara<00:01:32.579> Mary<00:01:33.060> was<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.750> understand

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
a mono dakara Mary was to understand

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.670 
a mono dakara Mary was to understand
where<00:01:34.380> Tina<00:01:35.310> Farina<00:01:35.700> finish<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.390> 1<00:01:36.630> B&amp;W<00:01:36.930> start

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
where Tina Farina finish and 1 B&amp;W start

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.950 
where Tina Farina finish and 1 B&amp;W start
and<00:01:39.229> we<00:01:40.229> always<00:01:40.409> discuss<00:01:40.740> if<00:01:41.340> we<00:01:41.759> do<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:42.149> is

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
and we always discuss if we do that is

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.959 
and we always discuss if we do that is
still<00:01:43.350> pininfarina<00:01:44.130> or<00:01:44.280> start<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.640> become<00:01:44.790> a

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:44.969 
still pininfarina or start to become a

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:47.389 
still pininfarina or start to become a
B&amp;W<00:01:45.450> they<00:01:45.750> said<00:01:45.960> now<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.409> do<00:01:46.740> pinin<00:01:47.100> farina

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
B&amp;W they said now you do pinin farina

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.240 
B&amp;W they said now you do pinin farina
and<00:01:47.670> we<00:01:48.540> try<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.930> make<00:01:49.259> sure<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.710> what<00:01:49.860> you<00:01:50.040> do

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
and we try to make sure that what you do

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.380 
and we try to make sure that what you do
still<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.329> B&amp;W<00:01:52.189> if<00:01:53.189> what<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:53.939> do<00:01:54.060> is<00:01:54.149> not<00:01:54.360> a

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
still is a B&amp;W if what you do is not a

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.810 
still is a B&amp;W if what you do is not a
B&amp;W<00:01:54.810> we<00:01:55.140> will<00:01:55.290> tell<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.890> if<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.549> feel

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
B&amp;W we will tell you and if you feel

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.249 
B&amp;W we will tell you and if you feel
that<00:01:56.880> what<00:01:57.240> we<00:01:57.360> are<00:01:57.390> telling<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:58.049> no

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
that what we are telling you is no

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.690 
that what we are telling you is no
longer<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.560> pinin<00:01:58.890> farina<00:01:59.219> please<00:01:59.430> tell<00:01:59.670> us

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
longer a pinin farina please tell us

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.370 
longer a pinin farina please tell us
because<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.270> are<00:02:00.509> leading<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.930> thing<00:02:01.170> and

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
because you are leading the thing and

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.469 
because you are leading the thing and
that<00:02:01.890> was<00:02:02.100> what<00:02:02.340> was<00:02:02.579> great<00:02:02.880> was<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.180> great

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
that was what was great was a great

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.420 
that was what was great was a great
experience<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.320> think<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.619> result<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.100> by

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
experience and I think the result is by

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.180 
experience and I think the result is by
far<00:02:05.820> much<00:02:06.719> more<00:02:07.049> valuable<00:02:07.439> than<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.860> simple

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
far much more valuable than the simple

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.669 
far much more valuable than the simple
sum<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:08.820> all<00:02:08.970> ready<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.899> good<00:02:10.110> value<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.500> two

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
sum of all ready the good value of two

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.160 
sum of all ready the good value of two
prestigious<00:02:11.070> brands<00:02:11.730> so<00:02:12.000> one<00:02:12.540> plus<00:02:12.720> one<00:02:12.900> it

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
prestigious brands so one plus one it

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.680 
prestigious brands so one plus one it
makes<00:02:13.350> three<00:02:13.739> that's<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.820> gun<00:02:15.000> glue

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.360 

well<00:02:20.690> you<00:02:20.780> know<00:02:20.900> we<00:02:21.050> have<00:02:21.290> a<00:02:21.320> process<00:02:21.710> where<00:02:22.220> we

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
well you know we have a process where we

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.540 
well you know we have a process where we
basically<00:02:22.580> went<00:02:23.060> step<00:02:23.450> by<00:02:23.480> step<00:02:23.960> and<00:02:24.310> each<00:02:25.310> one

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
basically went step by step and each one

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.490 
basically went step by step and each one
of<00:02:25.580> us<00:02:25.760> had<00:02:25.970> the<00:02:26.120> opportunity<00:02:26.780> to<00:02:26.810> step<00:02:27.320> back

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
of us had the opportunity to step back

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.200 
of us had the opportunity to step back
at<00:02:27.740> any<00:02:27.920> time<00:02:28.010> and<00:02:29.020> we<00:02:30.020> really<00:02:30.880> found<00:02:31.880> out

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
at any time and we really found out

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.290 
at any time and we really found out
through<00:02:32.570> the<00:02:32.720> process<00:02:33.230> that<00:02:33.260> we<00:02:33.470> think<00:02:34.310> alike

through the process that we think alike

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.900 
through the process that we think alike
on<00:02:35.600> a<00:02:35.660> lot<00:02:35.930> of<00:02:36.050> things<00:02:36.290> and<00:02:36.590> that<00:02:37.550> we<00:02:37.700> actually

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
on a lot of things and that we actually

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.700 
on a lot of things and that we actually
can<00:02:39.910> complete<00:02:40.910> each<00:02:41.090> other<00:02:41.360> in<00:02:41.600> many<00:02:42.020> ways<00:02:42.290> you

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
can complete each other in many ways you

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.150 
can complete each other in many ways you
know<00:02:42.880> and<00:02:43.880> I<00:02:44.270> definitely<00:02:44.600> felt<00:02:45.530> personally

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
know and I definitely felt personally

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.850 
know and I definitely felt personally
like<00:02:46.370> I<00:02:46.490> could<00:02:46.730> learn<00:02:46.940> a<00:02:46.970> lot<00:02:47.270> from

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
like I could learn a lot from

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.520 
like I could learn a lot from
pininfarina<00:02:48.860> and<00:02:49.010> from<00:02:49.190> Fabio<00:02:49.460> and<00:02:49.730> his<00:02:49.850> team

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
pininfarina and from Fabio and his team

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.350 
pininfarina and from Fabio and his team
but<00:02:51.530> I<00:02:51.560> definitely<00:02:51.920> had<00:02:52.610> the<00:02:52.760> feeling<00:02:53.120> I<00:02:53.270> know

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
but I definitely had the feeling I know

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.690 
but I definitely had the feeling I know
that<00:02:53.750> it<00:02:53.960> was<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.350> same<00:02:54.560> for<00:02:54.620> him<00:02:54.980> as<00:02:55.160> well<00:02:55.190> and

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
that it was the same for him as well and

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.780 
that it was the same for him as well and
through<00:02:56.360> this<00:02:56.510> sort<00:02:56.780> of<00:02:57.130> common<00:02:58.130> respect<00:02:58.520> for

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
through this sort of common respect for

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.080 
through this sort of common respect for
each<00:02:58.970> one's<00:02:59.270> filled<00:02:59.750> each<00:03:00.080> one's<00:03:00.320> expertise<00:03:01.090> I

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
each one's filled each one's expertise I

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.240 
each one's filled each one's expertise I
do<00:03:02.450> think<00:03:02.959> we<00:03:03.140> came<00:03:03.320> up<00:03:03.380> with<00:03:03.740> something<00:03:03.950> at

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
do think we came up with something at

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.070 
do think we came up with something at
the<00:03:04.280> end<00:03:04.490> that<00:03:04.610> is<00:03:04.670> really<00:03:05.060> the<00:03:05.209> more<00:03:05.720> than<00:03:05.959> the

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
the end that is really the more than the

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.390 
the end that is really the more than the
sum<00:03:06.350> of<00:03:06.380> these<00:03:06.650> two<00:03:06.709> entities<00:03:09.190> it<00:03:10.190> was<00:03:10.370> a

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
sum of these two entities it was a

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.160 
sum of these two entities it was a
really<00:03:10.730> great<00:03:11.090> project<00:03:11.690> a<00:03:11.750> really<00:03:11.959> fun

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
really great project a really fun

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.020 
really great project a really fun
project<00:03:12.410> because<00:03:13.040> it's<00:03:13.220> not<00:03:13.370> something<00:03:13.670> we

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
project because it's not something we

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.330 
project because it's not something we
have<00:03:14.300> to<00:03:14.510> do<00:03:14.630> it's<00:03:15.320> something<00:03:15.650> we<00:03:15.740> decide<00:03:16.130> to

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
have to do it's something we decide to

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.520 
have to do it's something we decide to
do<00:03:16.459> because<00:03:16.880> we<00:03:17.870> believe<00:03:18.170> that<00:03:18.320> there's<00:03:18.470> a

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
do because we believe that there's a

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.530 
do because we believe that there's a
certain<00:03:18.770> spirit<00:03:19.310> that<00:03:19.490> we<00:03:19.580> want<00:03:19.820> to<00:03:19.970> to

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
certain spirit that we want to to

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.500 
certain spirit that we want to to
achieve<00:03:20.959> together<00:03:21.380> I<00:03:22.150> think<00:03:23.150> the<00:03:23.269> most

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
achieve together I think the most

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.190 
achieve together I think the most
important<00:03:24.019> thing<00:03:24.080> is<00:03:24.380> really<00:03:25.330> as<00:03:26.330> you<00:03:27.019> know

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
important thing is really as you know

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.199 
important thing is really as you know
from<00:03:27.230> BMW<00:03:27.890> first<00:03:28.190> of<00:03:28.310> all<00:03:28.430> proportions<00:03:29.060> I

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
from BMW first of all proportions I

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.590 
from BMW first of all proportions I
think<00:03:29.420> we<00:03:29.510> work<00:03:29.750> very<00:03:29.930> hard<00:03:30.320> on<00:03:31.300> the<00:03:32.300> right

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
think we work very hard on the right

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.330 
think we work very hard on the right
proportions<00:03:33.320> I<00:03:33.500> think<00:03:33.739> when<00:03:33.890> you<00:03:33.980> look<00:03:34.010> at

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
proportions I think when you look at

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.420 
proportions I think when you look at
this<00:03:34.489> it's<00:03:34.760> really<00:03:35.360> clear<00:03:36.170> clean<00:03:37.010> cab

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
this it's really clear clean cab

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.600 
this it's really clear clean cab
rearward<00:03:38.080> proportions<00:03:39.080> long<00:03:39.830> hood<00:03:40.130> short

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
rearward proportions long hood short

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.660 
rearward proportions long hood short
front<00:03:41.180> overhang<00:03:41.690> but<00:03:42.530> also<00:03:42.709> the<00:03:43.070> proportions

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
front overhang but also the proportions

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.479 
front overhang but also the proportions
of<00:03:43.790> sort<00:03:44.060> of<00:03:44.150> this<00:03:44.750> the<00:03:45.110> stance<00:03:45.920> of<00:03:46.130> the<00:03:46.280> car

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
of sort of this the stance of the car

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.660 
of sort of this the stance of the car
it's<00:03:46.940> very<00:03:47.150> we<00:03:47.720> actually<00:03:48.080> called<00:03:48.620> the<00:03:48.980> design

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
it's very we actually called the design

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.940 
it's very we actually called the design
theme<00:03:49.970> if<00:03:50.120> you<00:03:50.269> will<00:03:50.390> with<00:03:50.570> it<00:03:50.720> the<00:03:51.380> the

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
theme if you will with it the the

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.620 
theme if you will with it the the
proportions<00:03:52.670> of<00:03:52.790> the<00:03:52.940> design<00:03:53.269> theme<00:03:53.480> the

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
proportions of the design theme the

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.870 
proportions of the design theme the
high-water<00:03:54.110> line<00:03:54.320> because<00:03:55.190> if<00:03:55.310> you<00:03:55.430> see<00:03:55.640> like

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
high-water line because if you see like

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.509 
high-water line because if you see like
the<00:03:56.060> core<00:03:56.780> of<00:03:56.810> the<00:03:57.080> car<00:03:57.350> the<00:03:57.680> shoulder<00:03:58.280> line<00:03:58.310> is

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
the core of the car the shoulder line is

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.570 
the core of the car the shoulder line is
very<00:03:58.910> high<00:03:59.209> so<00:03:59.510> it's<00:03:59.989> a<00:04:00.050> lot<00:04:00.170> about<00:04:00.350> very<00:04:01.100> pure

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
very high so it's a lot about very pure

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.500 
very high so it's a lot about very pure
lines<00:04:01.910> even<00:04:02.780> if<00:04:02.989> their<00:04:03.200> edges<00:04:03.769> or<00:04:03.950> if<00:04:04.190> their
