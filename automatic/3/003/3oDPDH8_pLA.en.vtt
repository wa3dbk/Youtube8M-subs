00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:19.781
 The same fungal diseases that occur in the garden generally develop on the terrace 

00:00:20.508 --> 00:00:26.508
 One of the most easily manifested is oidium; it is a fungus that attacks the upper page of the foliage 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.599
 causing large white spots, similar to flour or icing sugar 

00:00:31.734 --> 00:00:35.734
 over time the spots darken and curl the leaf page 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:42.559
 This type of disease develops preferably in spring, and is favored by the presence of moisture on the foliage 

00:00:43.356 --> 00:00:51.356
 to prevent the development of oidium it is generally sufficient to avoid watering the plants in the aerial part when the daily temperature range is high 

00:00:52.343 --> 00:01:01.343
 In periods with cool nights and high rainfall oidium tends to develop easily, it is cured using sulfur-based fungicides 

00:01:06.252 --> 00:01:14.252
 Another very common fungal disease is the fumaggine, caused by fungi that colonize the honeydew percolated on the foliage by insects, such as aphids or cochineal 

00:01:16.252 --> 00:01:22.252
 generally taking care of the plants affected by insects in a timely manner prevents the possibility of fumaggini developing 

00:01:24.038 --> 00:01:34.038
 if they develop sometimes it is sufficient to clean the foliage with a microfibre cloth, but in case of widespread development of the disease it is advisable to carry out treatments based on copper 

00:02:28.867 --> 00:02:35.870
 The other fungal diseases that develop easily are gray mold (botrytis), and root or collar rots 

00:02:35.987 --> 00:02:43.990
 these are molds and spots that develop at the base of the plant or on the foliage, with consequent rapid deterioration of the whole plant 

00:02:44.311 --> 00:02:51.310
 generally the development of these types of mushrooms is highly favored by environmental conditions and unsuitable cultivation methods 

00:02:52.435 --> 00:03:01.440
 The rots develop preferably in asphyxiated, damp soils with stagnant water; therefore correct waterings prevent the development of such pathologies 

00:03:02.762 --> 00:03:11.760
 Lack of ventilation, high environmental humidity and excesses of sulfur-based fertilizers favor the development of botrytis, the main cause of gray mold
