00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
think Lisa was really brave I can't even

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.300 
think Lisa was really brave I can't even
believe<00:02:21.660> that<00:02:21.870> she<00:02:22.080> allowed<00:02:22.500> them<00:02:22.709> to<00:02:22.739> cut<00:02:23.130> all

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
believe that she allowed them to cut all

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.650 
believe that she allowed them to cut all
of<00:02:23.340> her<00:02:23.550> hair<00:02:23.790> off<00:02:23.940> but<00:02:24.750> I<00:02:25.050> mean<00:02:25.850> mr.<00:02:26.850> J<00:02:27.180> did<00:02:27.420> say

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
of her hair off but I mean mr. J did say

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.300 
of her hair off but I mean mr. J did say
that<00:02:27.870> she<00:02:27.900> looked<00:02:28.170> like<00:02:28.260> a<00:02:28.320> downy<00:02:28.709> housewife

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
that she looked like a downy housewife

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.949 
that she looked like a downy housewife
but<00:02:29.610> I<00:02:29.640> really<00:02:30.000> don't<00:02:30.180> think<00:02:30.239> she<00:02:30.510> did<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:30.720> all

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
but I really don't think she did it all

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.010 
but I really don't think she did it all
in<00:02:31.230> fact<00:02:31.980> I<00:02:32.250> think<00:02:32.340> that<00:02:32.730> they<00:02:33.420> always<00:02:33.780> try<00:02:33.989> to

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
in fact I think that they always try to

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.540 
in fact I think that they always try to
make<00:02:34.290> it<00:02:34.440> seem<00:02:34.800> like<00:02:34.830> they<00:02:35.250> know<00:02:35.459> best<00:02:36.200> so<00:02:37.550> let

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.680 
alexandria's haircut but you know I
think<00:02:55.590> that<00:02:55.920> cry<00:02:56.310> was<00:02:56.550> a<00:02:56.580> little<00:02:57.000> forced

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
think that cry was a little forced

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.449 
think that cry was a little forced
yeah<00:02:57.840> I'm<00:02:58.080> just<00:02:58.410> so<00:02:58.739> happy<00:02:59.750> I<00:03:00.750> mean<00:03:01.560> I<00:03:01.800> hope<00:03:02.100> not

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.410 
but then again I don't really know and I
think<00:03:05.220> that<00:03:05.519> she<00:03:05.820> needs<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.150> take<00:03:06.360> that

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
think that she needs to take that

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.780 
think that she needs to take that
attention<00:03:06.720> off<00:03:07.410> her<00:03:07.650> much<00:03:07.950> as<00:03:08.130> possible
