00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:04.410
 It is this time, but is also a person each future Hello, everyone also 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.480
 Head lamp return five people before getting off one turn 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.279
 Cardboard and bluetooth keyboard but well developed inventory 

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:14.939
 Japan's first away game is waiting 

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:18.300
 It means that it was October 3 I grabbed it in October 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.410
 At Narita Airport 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.390
 that 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.829
 It is around this time 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:24.489
 If 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:27.180
 I have talked about Akita Prefecture as a job. 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.210
 I made an album that I had already given up and gave up 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.520
 What I expected of Japan was that I gave up but 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.810
 Hem 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.790
 Mr. Kudo is the third issue to bite into the third of his daughter 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.390
 There is a lot of stock if it is hope of meg 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.100
 I think I'm dropping it right away 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.870
 The sea 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.260
 It is in the organizing committee in the order trend that is that 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.929
 I noticed that I would suppress it from that point of view 

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:54.360
 Why am I too 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.210
 Yes, then I'm a little turf coat but no longer 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.210
 I wonder if there is anything 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.800
 I'm talking about a multiple of 3 * 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.080
 I really spread the savings that happen to cinema first, but 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.040
 This keyboard made me feel very good writing 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.840
 Pointed out and made a big hit 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.370
 It is Ema high brightness and that but I have experience here again 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.180
 I use solar cells 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.020
 And then here's the part of the switch north 4 islands Kunishima 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.590
 Uki 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.150
 I drew by 1 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.190
 I'm going to stil but I'll slide it beyond this well 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.300
 While 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.890
 recently 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.890
 It's here and it's here six times in the district 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.350
 I'm not sure about exposing a lock 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.600
 I agree 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.600
 Yeah 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.210
 I became heart 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.120
 It is your heart 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.930
 It will flash a little 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.299
 Yeah 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.770
 All make with this 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.150
 The switch is more uniform 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.260
 If you did not originally 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.580
 Late 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.550
 Control key 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.390
 This time 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.590
 See you at this time 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.700
 One hundred forty thousand 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.259
 It seems so. 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.219
 of river 

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:13.159
 I think it is visualization but 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:14.999
 Somehow 

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:18.819
 I am strengthening the ethical code in this state I already have all schools 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.209
 To the palm of the farmer of children 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.209
 It is about winter time 

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:27.729
 It is called a keyboard 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.149
 Do you see 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:33.679
 It's called a device robbery 

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:36.609
 Register below that application has 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:39.719
 Please install this by yourself 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:42.170
 This explains 8 losses 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.019
 Gel-like 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.019
 Move 

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:49.129
 Yup 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:50.040
 This comment 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.389
 Then you 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:54.889
 Yes, I am automatically connected and I'm connected in parentheses 

00:02:57.619 --> 00:03:00.769
 It is good that this is also connected 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.260
 It is still as it is 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.509
 so-so 

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:05.909
 air application 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:07.739
 By the way 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.629
 The application itself 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:11.749
 The body is 

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:14.069
 Eh record 3rd 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.889
 The United States has sent 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:19.399
 It is a warning method, so it works in this state, so even piece years 

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:21.110
 If you want to launch 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.459
 I'm talking at once 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.569
 Of course when you ask Matsui Memoma a lot of pace 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:26.669
 There is 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:30.800
 It's decorate and you press the washing machine. 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.849
 The category is 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.719
 Ethiopia is great but it's also in category 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:36.840
 It's a bullet 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.709
 to go 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.879
 But Mr Hank is big and around 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.090
 For example, make a new horse 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.090
 It's up to 08 degrees to feed 

00:03:48.029 --> 00:03:49.039
 that 

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:52.109
 I prefer to stay inside 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:39.139
 I will record in advance to notice that 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:41.960
 Press the function key to select the mind 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.159
 While it is called arrow key 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:45.810
 It will be in a good shape 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.889
 You may think operation in the first in Malto, but 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.900
 If you get used to the theme, it feels like eight people are expensive. 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.659
 Sexually oriented input is English 

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:58.000
 Maa's 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.560
 If you can use it with both hands 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.300
 It's legal overwhelmingly yeah 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.580
 I feel like I'm sure 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:08.930
 How is it 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.930
 Oh dear 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.300
 I wanted to do my best 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.400
 I have that 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.210
 I wonder if there is any loss or not, but I can not forget the name, and Nekota 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.050
 It is not related to that distance, and there are some shakes 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.810
 Even if it does not hang, it does in the feeling of cat, and the statistics station is six days 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.050
 In Beijing 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.330
 that 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.330
 Moreover 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:33.280
 But there is 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.150
 How about using it for a moment 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.620
 It's a bit regrettable, but it's cheap while I'm getting off boarding 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.540
 No.12312's four-ball and each application with this 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.080
 To be able to cope 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.230
 It has become a messy, but actually it corresponds 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:49.509
 I don't do it This is a bit useless 

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:51.839
 It is a bit disappointing, but also 

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:54.569
 Finally I say where the candidate 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:58.199
 I think the form is bad but some of this 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:00.509
 Box was a task 

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:03.499
 I will use it again 

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:06.089
 Yeah it's a menu 

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:08.300
 This sunrise after the lecture 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.259
 Rain 

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:12.330
 It is the best now 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.710
 nqn 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.610
 Good members like Eco are originally 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.930
 Right place 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.289
 I wonder 

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:23.900
 It is the best now 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.900
 that 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:29.139
 I mean 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:30.449
 Excuse me 

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:33.849
 It's a little bit weird about how everyone's going 

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:34.240
 so 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.240
 It's a bit disappointing, but it was a success 

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:41.820
 There is an unfortunate place, but still the status of that child 

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:42.430
 Top 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:46.910
 The recording of faction wear is slightly different from the chairperson 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.229
 It is a feeling that it will be written about the stock 

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:52.529
 It's about time from now on ぇ 10,000 km 

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:54.860
 There is also this 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.219
 Advanced function chart 

00:06:56.219 --> 00:06:59.519
 I think I will try to use I also this bluetooth 

00:06:59.519 --> 00:07:00.539
 ing 

00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:02.360
 What 

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.839
 In this fire 

00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:05.219
 What 

00:07:05.219 --> 00:07:08.219
 End 

00:07:09.999 --> 00:07:12.489
 I do not know where the keyboard switch is 

00:07:12.489 --> 00:07:13.869
 I was very worried
