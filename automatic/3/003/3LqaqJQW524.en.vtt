00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
this in a 77 millimeter filter thread

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.120 
this in a 77 millimeter filter thread
because<00:00:33.180> that's<00:00:34.180> size<00:00:34.390> of<00:00:34.510> melons<00:00:34.660> so<00:00:35.500> and<00:00:35.830> as

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:36.130 
because that's size of melons so and as

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.850 
because that's size of melons so and as
I<00:00:36.250> take<00:00:36.430> this<00:00:36.550> out<00:00:36.760> we<00:00:36.880> got<00:00:37.030> the<00:00:37.740> plastic<00:00:38.740> over

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
I take this out we got the plastic over

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.460 
I take this out we got the plastic over
the<00:00:38.950> top<00:00:38.980> of<00:00:39.370> it<00:00:39.550> and<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:40.870> see<00:00:41.050> that<00:00:41.080> we<00:00:41.320> have

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
the top of it and you see that we have

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.970 
the top of it and you see that we have
this<00:00:41.650> um<00:00:41.950> tactical<00:00:42.940> filter<00:00:43.330> so<00:00:44.290> as<00:00:44.440> I<00:00:44.530> open<00:00:44.860> it

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
this um tactical filter so as I open it

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:51.390 
this um tactical filter so as I open it
up<00:00:48.120> we<00:00:49.120> have<00:00:49.300> the<00:00:49.630> filter<00:00:50.080> and<00:00:50.800> this<00:00:51.010> is<00:00:51.070> good

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:51.400 
up we have the filter and this is good

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.930 
up we have the filter and this is good
use<00:00:51.610> as<00:00:51.760> why<00:00:51.970> was<00:00:52.180> raining<00:00:52.630> and<00:00:52.930> this<00:00:53.890> like<00:00:54.790> the

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
use as why was raining and this like the

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.790 
use as why was raining and this like the
purpose<00:00:55.330> of<00:00:55.450> this<00:00:55.600> is<00:00:55.780> to<00:00:55.960> cut<00:00:56.290> down<00:00:56.320> a<00:00:56.530> light

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
purpose of this is to cut down a light

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.670 
purpose of this is to cut down a light
so<00:00:57.040> for<00:00:57.250> example<00:00:57.670> from<00:00:57.820> videos<00:00:58.660> I'm<00:00:59.350> outside

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
so for example from videos I'm outside

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.960 
so for example from videos I'm outside
throwing<00:00:59.920> a<00:01:00.010> video<00:01:00.280> and<00:01:00.460> I<00:01:00.490> want<00:01:00.700> a<00:01:00.730> decent

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
throwing a video and I want a decent

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.580 
throwing a video and I want a decent
shutter<00:01:01.420> speed<00:01:01.780> to<00:01:02.050> match<00:01:02.770> the<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:05.290> frame

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
shutter speed to match the the frame

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.650 
shutter speed to match the the frame
rate<00:01:05.770> of<00:01:05.800> the<00:01:05.980> video<00:01:06.160> I<00:01:06.640> will<00:01:07.210> use<00:01:07.240> this<00:01:07.510> to

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
rate of the video I will use this to

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.060 
rate of the video I will use this to
stop<00:01:07.870> down<00:01:08.020> the<00:01:08.170> light<00:01:08.350> just<00:01:08.650> so<00:01:08.800> I<00:01:08.860> want<00:01:09.010> to

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
stop down the light just so I want to

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.550 
stop down the light just so I want to
raise<00:01:09.310> up<00:01:09.520> the<00:01:09.550> shutter<00:01:09.910> speed<00:01:10.030> and<00:01:10.570> this

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
raise up the shutter speed and this

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.580 
raise up the shutter speed and this
would<00:01:11.710> be<00:01:11.830> good<00:01:12.040> you<00:01:12.070> know<00:01:13.440> someone<00:01:14.440> get<00:01:14.560> that

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
would be good you know someone get that

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.950 
would be good you know someone get that
jaggedness<00:01:15.190> and<00:01:15.640> like<00:01:15.820> a<00:01:16.150> high<00:01:16.600> shutter<00:01:16.900> speed

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
jaggedness and like a high shutter speed

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.840 
jaggedness and like a high shutter speed
video<00:01:17.320> and<00:01:17.770> I'll<00:01:17.860> try<00:01:18.010> to<00:01:18.040> get<00:01:18.250> a<00:01:18.280> natural<00:01:18.700> look

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
video and I'll try to get a natural look

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.930 
video and I'll try to get a natural look
and<00:01:19.120> the<00:01:20.050> photos<00:01:20.410> get<00:01:21.010> some<00:01:21.220> long<00:01:21.400> exposures

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
and the photos get some long exposures

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.910 
and the photos get some long exposures
during<00:01:21.970> a<00:01:22.240> date<00:01:22.420> zone<00:01:22.660> and<00:01:23.290> this<00:01:23.680> has<00:01:23.890> a

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
during a date zone and this has a

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.430 
during a date zone and this has a
variable<00:01:24.510> you<00:01:25.510> see<00:01:25.750> how<00:01:25.870> you<00:01:25.930> can<00:01:26.170> see<00:01:26.290> my

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
variable you see how you can see my

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.050 
variable you see how you can see my
finger<00:01:26.830> and<00:01:27.070> there's<00:01:27.310> a<00:01:27.430> twist<00:01:27.730> that<00:01:27.820> you<00:01:27.880> can

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
finger and there's a twist that you can

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.820 
finger and there's a twist that you can
see<00:01:28.210> it<00:01:28.330> more<00:01:28.510> but<00:01:29.200> if<00:01:29.290> I<00:01:29.380> twist<00:01:29.560> it<00:01:29.680> the<00:01:29.800> other

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
see it more but if I twist it the other

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.730 
see it more but if I twist it the other
way<00:01:30.130> my<00:01:30.340> finger<00:01:30.610> disappears<00:01:31.440> and<00:01:32.440> this<00:01:32.530> is<00:01:32.680> a

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
way my finger disappears and this is a

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.470 
way my finger disappears and this is a
control<00:01:33.070> of<00:01:33.190> different<00:01:33.460> lights<00:01:33.610> you<00:01:33.790> can<00:01:33.940> stop

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.480 
control of different lights you can stop

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.320 
control of different lights you can stop
it<00:01:34.690> down<00:01:34.870> to<00:01:35.230> you<00:01:35.470> know<00:01:35.760> if<00:01:36.760> you<00:01:36.909> want<00:01:37.090> to<00:01:37.180> have

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
it down to you know if you want to have

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.690 
it down to you know if you want to have
it<00:01:37.480> like<00:01:37.630> really<00:01:37.900> dark<00:01:38.110> get<00:01:39.040> our<00:01:39.130> string<00:01:39.490> long

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
exposures on the daytime ideal and you

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.280 
exposures on the daytime ideal and you
can<00:01:42.970> blend<00:01:43.180> it<00:01:43.360> with<00:01:43.450> any<00:01:43.600> between<00:01:43.960> any<00:01:44.200> of

I'm just gonna come here and twist this
a<00:02:14.150> little<00:02:14.510> bit<00:02:14.660> and<00:02:14.810> you're<00:02:14.900> gonna<00:02:14.989> see<00:02:15.260> the

a little bit and you're gonna see the
different<00:02:15.650> exposure<00:02:16.040> changes<00:02:17.739> and<00:02:18.739> you're

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
different exposure changes and you're

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.550 
different exposure changes and you're
gonna<00:02:18.980> see<00:02:19.220> how<00:02:19.310> it<00:02:19.400> gets<00:02:19.520> darker<00:02:20.110> and<00:02:21.110> darker

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
gonna see how it gets darker and darker

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.250 
gonna see how it gets darker and darker
and<00:02:21.950> things<00:02:22.190> like<00:02:22.340> that<00:02:22.450> so<00:02:23.450> depending<00:02:24.110> on<00:02:24.140> how

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
and things like that so depending on how

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.680 
and things like that so depending on how
much<00:02:24.410> light<00:02:24.680> you<00:02:24.709> want<00:02:25.069> you<00:02:25.819> can<00:02:25.970> just<00:02:26.150> spin<00:02:26.540> it

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
much light you want you can just spin it

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.570 
much light you want you can just spin it
and<00:02:26.900> you'll<00:02:27.020> get<00:02:27.170> them<00:02:27.230> desired<00:02:28.190> amount<00:02:28.400> of

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
and you'll get them desired amount of

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.940 
and you'll get them desired amount of
light<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.870> this<00:02:30.019> is<00:02:30.080> really<00:02:30.349> good<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:30.709> it's

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
light and this is really good and it's

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.460 
light and this is really good and it's
just<00:02:31.130> effect<00:02:31.550> on<00:02:31.730> world<00:02:31.970> Tom<00:02:33.519> the<00:02:34.519> variable

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
just effect on world Tom the variable

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
you don't let in as much light as you

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.600 
you don't let in as much light as you
would<00:02:59.170> without<00:02:59.290> the<00:02:59.560> ND<00:02:59.800> filter<00:03:00.160> so<00:03:00.370> if<00:03:00.460> you're

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
would without the ND filter so if you're

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.180 
would without the ND filter so if you're
sucking<00:03:01.030> in<00:03:01.150> light<00:03:01.360> as<00:03:02.200> far<00:03:02.590> as<00:03:02.710> trying<00:03:02.980> to<00:03:03.010> get

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
sucking in light as far as trying to get

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.240 
sucking in light as far as trying to get
a<00:03:03.400> fast<00:03:03.820> shutter<00:03:04.090> speed<00:03:04.510> I<00:03:04.780> would<00:03:05.140> take<00:03:05.440> the<00:03:05.590> ND

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
a fast shutter speed I would take the ND

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.220 
a fast shutter speed I would take the ND
filter<00:03:06.280> off<00:03:06.790> but<00:03:07.180> if<00:03:07.630> you<00:03:07.780> want<00:03:07.960> the<00:03:08.080> long

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
filter off but if you want the long

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.290 
filter off but if you want the long
exposure<00:03:08.650> if<00:03:08.980> you<00:03:09.100> want<00:03:09.280> if<00:03:09.460> it's<00:03:09.670> so<00:03:09.910> bright

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
exposure if you want if it's so bright

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.850

and<00:03:10.720> you<00:03:10.810> want<00:03:11.050> to<00:03:11.110> just<00:03:11.290> cut<00:03:11.470> there<00:03:11.620> and<00:03:11.680> light

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
and you want to just cut there and light

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.440 
and you want to just cut there and light
a<00:03:11.890> little<00:03:12.070> bit<00:03:12.340> but<00:03:12.490> you<00:03:12.580> want<00:03:12.610> to<00:03:12.790> keep<00:03:12.970> a<00:03:13.120> big

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
a little bit but you want to keep a big
