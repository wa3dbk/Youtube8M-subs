00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:09.770
 July 9 with flags or without a roman 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.629
 never became independent of good football what 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.369
 what happened this afternoon is weird because 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:16.190
 there is a green light for him to stay one 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:22.550
 football game is weird if it happened well 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:25.760
 It's been a little while now in the mouth 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.650
 we can present it like this is not right 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.539
 but always from the vision of Pablo 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.920
 duggan everything is weird it's weird that a 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.449
 man does not like soccer many 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.129
 Many mouth partners like to leave me 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:36.570
 and if we want to enter the court 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:39.580
 our 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.370
 Share all this for you Felix and look 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.320
 what is typical of whore 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.480
 the respect ends half Christmas a 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.220
 roman in mouth in mouth 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.890
 falcioni with this climate I say me the 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.730
 partners you have to go you have to go what 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.060
 puts mouth 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.670
 riquelme 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:02.559
 is listening to the joke 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.559
 look we are with córdoba 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.080
 have been announced is 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.540
 because what's going 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.210
 besides being one of the largest in 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.979
 the history of national football riquelme 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.360
 holds a record I know that it is the only 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.520
 footballer for whom the fans 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.770
 they made the endurance with 2 banderazos and 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.900
 attentive and with playing rock because their 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.900
 bandereros jump to the jugular 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.240
 so let me play if it's okay 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.240
 physically how is today riquelme 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:56.430
 it's better that we have this fan of 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.430
 mouth in favor of juan román riquelme 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:20.780
 he has to play a lot and he 's very massive 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.250
 but neither should we exaggerate crowds 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.319
 which is a lot to follow the cause 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.420
 who commanded the Dinamarquesa so already 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.250
 was raised in the city of good 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.280
 airs in the plaza of the republic here 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.260
 in the obelisk a call for 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.870
 international squats we could 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.660
 say good from copenhague and tania 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.310
 well contame you found that the 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.650
 manifestation to which it came that walk 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.930
 now I do not understand anything because before 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.769
 when I lived here there were always many 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:51.890
 moved like that and one of my colleagues 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:54.050
 they invited to go to this march today I thought 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.640
 that I was going to come here to support and to 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.640
 same time count a little bit of 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:03.340
 christiania but there is no one 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.340
 you could say it 's in video boluda 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:10.180
 yes and now we have to see quilombo to drink 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.739
 somewhere the important thing is the 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.720
 feeling of all those who went to 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.239
 banderazo that bancan a román and also 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.110
 they care for the most sensitive followers of 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:21.489
 roaming 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:24.050
 if we also have zinc and it's 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:26.840
 that the revolt 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:29.240
 and that has been aware of all this 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.900
 and know this truth to these were to depart 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.570
 father 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:37.320
 I stayed in his feelings of pity 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.320
 yesteryear 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:42.280
 a cultural fact is not many times 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.579
 art relative many times the 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.890
 patient a sports discipline and more 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:50.260
 I think that the artists of 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.579
 those who play football is 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.099
 the closest thing to an artist with 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:56.290
 case is because they do not do 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:58.090
 wines of the game of football for friends 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.420
 is very bad is matías had to almería 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.340
 and omar a question for Matías seriously 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.900
 because I speak we compare the videos and 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.150
 I wanted to know if with the two beatles 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:11.640
 alive or with them 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.640
 and his dad feeling
