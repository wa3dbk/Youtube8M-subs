once again there's there's two elements
I'm<00:00:48.690> thinking<00:00:48.989> about<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.470> nature<00:00:51.140> survival

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
I'm thinking about is nature survival

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.530 
I'm thinking about is nature survival
prosperity<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:52.980> then<00:00:53.160> there's<00:00:53.540> governments

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
prosperity and then there's governments

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.070 
prosperity and then there's governments
that<00:00:54.780> can<00:00:55.020> get<00:00:55.980> out<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.250> control<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:57.000> mess<00:00:57.870> up

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.080 
that can get out of control and mess up

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.130 
that can get out of control and mess up
regular<00:00:58.559> everyday<00:00:58.770> life<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.930> that's<00:01:00.930> where

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
regular everyday life and that's where

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.750 
regular everyday life and that's where
you<00:01:01.170> need<00:01:01.290> to<00:01:01.500> be<00:01:01.530> able<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.280> be<00:01:02.400> prepared

without<00:01:03.059> government<00:01:03.720> assistance<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:05.960> that's

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
without government assistance and that's

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.160 
without government assistance and that's
one<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.100> exact<00:01:08.520> reasons<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.270> put<00:01:09.990> that

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
one of the exact reasons I put that

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.900 
one of the exact reasons I put that
