00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710

and not only do I want to comment on it
but<00:00:37.510> I<00:00:37.540> also<00:00:37.720> realized<00:00:38.079> that<00:00:38.230> it's<00:00:38.350> not<00:00:38.500> going

00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:38.769 
but I also realized that it's not going

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:40.410 
but I also realized that it's not going
to<00:00:38.860> be<00:00:38.949> a<00:00:38.980> very<00:00:39.250> entertaining<00:00:39.579> one<00:00:40.089> to<00:00:40.210> do

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
to be a very entertaining one to do

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.819 
to be a very entertaining one to do
which<00:00:40.659> is<00:00:40.690> a<00:00:40.809> long<00:00:41.019> way<00:00:41.170> of<00:00:41.290> me<00:00:41.409> saying<00:00:41.680> that

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
which is a long way of me saying that

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:43.710 
which is a long way of me saying that
this<00:00:41.949> likely<00:00:42.370> isn't<00:00:42.699> going<00:00:42.850> to<00:00:42.940> be<00:00:43.000> a<00:00:43.030> fun<00:00:43.420> or

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 
this likely isn't going to be a fun or

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.420 
this likely isn't going to be a fun or
funny<00:00:43.989> discussion<00:00:44.500> video<00:00:44.710> and<00:00:45.010> for<00:00:45.250> that<00:00:45.309> I'm

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
funny discussion video and for that I'm

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.860 
funny discussion video and for that I'm
regretful<00:00:45.790> but<00:00:46.059> I<00:00:46.089> think<00:00:46.300> diving<00:00:46.600> is<00:00:46.659> one<00:00:46.809> of

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
regretful but I think diving is one of

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
is worth discussing if only so my very

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.599 
is worth discussing if only so my very
young<00:00:50.469> audience<00:00:50.680> they<00:00:51.070> likely<00:00:51.430> learn
