00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.539 
this I got a pin little pin and I
drilled<00:03:28.090> I<00:03:28.330> cut<00:03:28.750> this<00:03:28.930> off<00:03:29.170> so<00:03:29.440> what<00:03:29.590> has<00:03:30.519> a

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
drilled I cut this off so what has a

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.460 
drilled I cut this off so what has a
hole<00:03:30.819> through<00:03:31.060> it<00:03:31.150> and<00:03:31.810> I<00:03:31.900> just<00:03:32.110> put<00:03:32.290> it<00:03:32.379> in

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
hole through it and I just put it in

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.910 
hole through it and I just put it in
between<00:03:32.590> the<00:03:32.860> two<00:03:32.980> hitches<00:03:33.790> and<00:03:34.530> then<00:03:35.530> I<00:03:35.680> put

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
between the two hitches and then I put

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:42.509 
between the two hitches and then I put
drop<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:36.489> pin<00:03:36.700> through<00:03:36.879> there<00:03:37.090> and<00:03:41.400> looks<00:03:42.400> a

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
drop the pin through there and looks a

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.180 
drop the pin through there and looks a
lot<00:03:42.670> more<00:03:42.940> realistic<00:03:43.360> and<00:03:43.959> it<00:03:44.170> works<00:03:44.799> for<00:03:45.069> this

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
lot more realistic and it works for this

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.300 
lot more realistic and it works for this
