excited to test the Breville sous chef
food<00:00:10.860> processor<00:00:11.519> I<00:00:11.730> was<00:00:12.179> blown<00:00:12.450> away<00:00:12.480> by<00:00:12.929> this

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
food processor I was blown away by this

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.570 
food processor I was blown away by this
machine<00:00:13.290> I<00:00:13.469> can't<00:00:13.830> wait<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.099> show<00:00:14.250> you<00:00:14.309> all<00:00:14.549> of

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
machine I can't wait to show you all of

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.820 
machine I can't wait to show you all of
its<00:00:14.759> features<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.240> benefits<00:00:15.570> let<00:00:16.529> me<00:00:16.590> start

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
its features and benefits let me start

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.590 
its features and benefits let me start
right<00:00:16.859> here<00:00:17.160> with<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.400> feed<00:00:17.609> tube<00:00:17.880> it's

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
right here with the feed tube it's

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.090 
right here with the feed tube it's
incredible<00:00:18.960> because<00:00:19.080> it<00:00:19.320> has<00:00:19.470> an<00:00:19.650> extra-large

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
incredible because it has an extra-large

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.769 
incredible because it has an extra-large
one<00:00:20.400> now<00:00:20.580> so<00:00:20.910> you<00:00:20.970> don't<00:00:21.060> even<00:00:21.210> have<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.570> think

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
one now so you don't even have to think

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.170 
one now so you don't even have to think
about<00:00:22.080> cutting<00:00:22.650> larger<00:00:23.279> vegetables<00:00:23.820> before

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
about cutting larger vegetables before

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.580 
about cutting larger vegetables before
you<00:00:24.269> put<00:00:24.449> them<00:00:24.600> right<00:00:24.720> in<00:00:24.869> for<00:00:25.019> processing

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
you put them right in for processing

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.650 
you put them right in for processing
they<00:00:26.400> were<00:00:26.460> smart<00:00:26.880> enough<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.150> think<00:00:27.359> about

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
they were smart enough to think about

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.630 
they were smart enough to think about
keeping<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.320> smaller<00:00:28.650> feed<00:00:28.980> tube<00:00:29.189> too<00:00:29.460> though

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
keeping a smaller feed tube too though

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.740 
keeping a smaller feed tube too though
so<00:00:29.880> if<00:00:29.970> you<00:00:30.060> want<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.300> do<00:00:30.390> anything<00:00:30.599> like

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
so if you want to do anything like

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.569 
so if you want to do anything like
carrots<00:00:31.289> or<00:00:31.439> smaller<00:00:31.710> vegetables<00:00:32.279> they<00:00:32.399> just

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
carrots or smaller vegetables they just

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.270 
carrots or smaller vegetables they just
go<00:00:32.730> right<00:00:32.940> through<00:00:33.000> for<00:00:33.450> processing<00:00:34.280> right

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
go right through for processing right

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.380 
go right through for processing right
now<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.489> can<00:00:35.700> see<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:36.000> I've<00:00:36.120> got<00:00:36.300> the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
now you can see that I've got the

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.450 
now you can see that I've got the
smaller<00:00:36.690> Bowl<00:00:37.050> in<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.739> this<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.040> great

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460

require a lot of space you can see that

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.940 
require a lot of space you can see that
that<00:00:45.629> just<00:00:45.840> pops<00:00:46.050> right<00:00:46.170> out<00:00:46.320> with<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.649> small

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
that just pops right out with that small

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.369 
that just pops right out with that small
blade<00:00:47.329> now<00:00:48.329> here's<00:00:48.629> one<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:48.899> my<00:00:49.020> favorite

blade now here's one of my favorite
things<00:00:49.559> about<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:50.010> food<00:00:50.280> processor<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:51.000> that

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
things about this food processor is that

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.450 
things about this food processor is that
the<00:00:51.660> engineers<00:00:52.020> really<00:00:52.350> thought<00:00:52.620> through<00:00:53.010> how

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
the engineers really thought through how

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.330 
the engineers really thought through how
to<00:00:53.520> store<00:00:54.390> everything<00:00:54.870> for<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:56.160> really

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
to store everything for you you really

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.740 
to store everything for you you really
want<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.640> worry<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:57.030> know<00:00:57.059> sometimes<00:00:57.510> from<00:00:57.690> a

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
want to worry you know sometimes from a

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.180 
want to worry you know sometimes from a
safety<00:00:57.960> perspective<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.620> don't<00:00:58.649> want<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.100> be

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
safety perspective I don't want to be

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.560 
safety perspective I don't want to be
digging<00:00:59.520> in<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.850> finding<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.239> blade<00:01:00.480> in<00:01:00.539> your

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
digging in and finding a blade in your

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.450 
digging in and finding a blade in your
cabinet<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.530> they<00:01:01.710> were<00:01:01.770> smart<00:01:02.219> enough<00:01:02.280> to

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
cabinet and so they were smart enough to

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.149 
cabinet and so they were smart enough to
put<00:01:02.730> all<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.210> in<00:01:03.390> one<00:01:03.570> compact<00:01:04.019> case<00:01:04.439> or

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
put all of this in one compact case or

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.399 
put all of this in one compact case or
you<00:01:05.220> can<00:01:05.369> just<00:01:05.519> show<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.210> then<00:01:07.049> store<00:01:07.380> it

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
you can just show it and then store it

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.640 
you can just show it and then store it
on<00:01:07.590> its<00:01:07.740> side<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.189> cabinet<00:01:09.260> it'll<00:01:10.260> take<00:01:10.470> out

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
on its side in a cabinet it'll take out

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.580 
on its side in a cabinet it'll take out
the<00:01:10.680> slicing<00:01:11.280> blade<00:01:11.720> now<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:12.900> again<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.229> can't

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
the slicing blade now this again I can't

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.140 
the slicing blade now this again I can't
believe<00:01:13.799> they<00:01:13.950> thought<00:01:14.130> about<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:14.670> but<00:01:15.060> they

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
believe they thought about this but they

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.240 
believe they thought about this but they
actually<00:01:15.390> have<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.229> measurement<00:01:16.619> on<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.009> back

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
actually have a measurement on the back

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.940 
actually have a measurement on the back
here<00:01:17.610> where<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.720> can<00:01:18.960> adjust<00:01:19.049> how<00:01:19.500> thick<00:01:19.830> you

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
here where you can adjust how thick you

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.160 
here where you can adjust how thick you
like<00:01:19.979> your<00:01:20.220> slices<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.150> you'll<00:01:21.659> see<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:22.049> it

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
like your slices and you'll see that it

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.530 
like your slices and you'll see that it
has<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.320> storage<00:01:22.770> position<00:01:23.400> on<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:24.270> right

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
has a storage position on it so right

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.179 
has a storage position on it so right
now<00:01:24.689> it's<00:01:24.930> completely<00:01:25.409> flush<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.009> can't

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
now it's completely flush and you can't

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.109 
now it's completely flush and you can't
worry<00:01:26.340> about<00:01:26.400> cutting<00:01:26.759> yourself

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
worry about cutting yourself

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.169 
worry about cutting yourself
but<00:01:29.990> I'm<00:01:30.140> going<00:01:30.380> to<00:01:30.409> do<00:01:30.560> some<00:01:30.740> thin<00:01:30.950> slices<00:01:31.520> so

00:01:32.169 --> 00:01:32.179 
but I'm going to do some thin slices so

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:33.399 
but I'm going to do some thin slices so
I'm<00:01:32.420> going<00:01:32.570> to<00:01:32.600> change<00:01:32.840> it<00:01:32.929> to<00:01:33.020> about<00:01:33.140> two<00:01:33.380> and

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
I'm going to change it to about two and

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.919 
I'm going to change it to about two and
a<00:01:33.560> half<00:01:33.590> millimeters<00:01:34.340> you<00:01:35.240> can<00:01:35.359> slice<00:01:35.630> things

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:35.929 
a half millimeters you can slice things

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:37.870 
a half millimeters you can slice things
anywhere<00:01:36.320> from<00:01:36.500> zero<00:01:36.920> to<00:01:37.070> eight<00:01:37.490> millimeters

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
anywhere from zero to eight millimeters

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.679 
anywhere from zero to eight millimeters
in<00:01:38.329> thickness<00:01:39.640> this<00:01:40.640> biddle<00:01:41.030> just<00:01:41.210> pops<00:01:41.450> in

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
in thickness this biddle just pops in

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:43.149 
in thickness this biddle just pops in
for<00:01:41.869> any<00:01:42.109> of<00:01:42.259> these<00:01:42.380> blades<00:01:42.710> you're<00:01:42.950> using

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
for any of these blades you're using

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.580 
for any of these blades you're using
let's<00:01:44.149> go<00:01:44.240> put<00:01:44.390> this<00:01:44.509> right<00:01:44.719> on<00:01:44.840> top<00:01:44.869> can<00:01:45.500> you

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
let's go put this right on top can you

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.050 
let's go put this right on top can you
see<00:01:45.740> how<00:01:45.829> there's<00:01:45.979> barely<00:01:46.189> any<00:01:46.520> room<00:01:46.850> between

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
see how there's barely any room between

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.760 
see how there's barely any room between
where<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.569> blade<00:01:47.780> is<00:01:47.810> and<00:01:48.140> where<00:01:48.259> the<00:01:48.409> bowl<00:01:48.590> is

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
where the blade is and where the bowl is

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.469 
where the blade is and where the bowl is
this<00:01:49.490> means<00:01:49.700> you<00:01:49.819> won't<00:01:49.909> have<00:01:50.060> a<00:01:50.209> lot<00:01:50.390> of

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
this means you won't have a lot of

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.749 
this means you won't have a lot of
fallout<00:01:50.899> and<00:01:51.140> extra<00:01:51.500> pieces<00:01:52.100> of<00:01:52.219> your<00:01:52.369> produce

actually<00:03:13.160> a<00:03:13.640> shredding<00:03:14.180> blade<00:03:14.390> that's

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
actually a shredding blade that's

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.990 
actually a shredding blade that's
reversible<00:03:15.170> so<00:03:15.740> you<00:03:15.830> can<00:03:15.950> see<00:03:16.130> these<00:03:16.340> coarser

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
reversible so you can see these coarser

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.820 
reversible so you can see these coarser
larger<00:03:17.450> holes<00:03:17.630> here<00:03:17.930> and<00:03:18.110> then<00:03:18.260> you<00:03:18.380> flip<00:03:18.710> it

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
larger holes here and then you flip it

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.340 
larger holes here and then you flip it
over<00:03:19.010> then<00:03:19.700> you<00:03:19.820> have<00:03:19.940> a<00:03:19.970> fine<00:03:20.300> shredder<00:03:20.720> it's

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
over then you have a fine shredder it's

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.910 
over then you have a fine shredder it's
just<00:03:21.590> again<00:03:21.950> such<00:03:22.250> clever<00:03:22.550> design<00:03:23.680> put<00:03:24.680> it<00:03:24.770> in

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920
