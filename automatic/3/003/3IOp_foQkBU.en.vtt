00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.050 
legs are actually stored back here I
assume<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.539> as<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.720> variety<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.319> purposes<00:02:11.060> one

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
assume that as a variety of purposes one

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.990 
assume that as a variety of purposes one
being<00:02:12.330> I'm

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
being I'm

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.790 
being I'm
the<00:02:13.210> assumption<00:02:14.020> that<00:02:14.050> maybe<00:02:14.380> we're<00:02:14.740> gonna

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
the assumption that maybe we're gonna

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.160 
the assumption that maybe we're gonna
get<00:02:15.070> some<00:02:15.340> extra<00:02:15.670> little<00:02:16.030> add-ons<00:02:16.450> or<00:02:16.780> you<00:02:17.020> can

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
get some extra little add-ons or you can

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.390 
get some extra little add-ons or you can
just<00:02:17.320> mess<00:02:17.500> around<00:02:17.530> with<00:02:17.830> things<00:02:18.010> and<00:02:18.130> attach

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
just mess around with things and attach

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.540 
just mess around with things and attach
them<00:02:18.700> to<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.970> legs<00:02:19.210> and<00:02:20.100> that<00:02:21.100> gives<00:02:21.370> it<00:02:21.460> a

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
them to the legs and that gives it a

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.400 
them to the legs and that gives it a
little<00:02:21.670> more<00:02:21.910> weight<00:02:22.180> in<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.390> legs<00:02:22.660> so<00:02:22.990> it

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
little more weight in the legs so it

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.130 
little more weight in the legs so it
makes<00:02:23.710> it<00:02:23.860> a<00:02:23.920> little<00:02:24.190> bit<00:02:24.460> sturdier<00:02:24.960> now<00:02:25.960> these

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
makes it a little bit sturdier now these

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.070 
makes it a little bit sturdier now these
figures<00:02:26.440> are<00:02:26.950> between<00:02:27.750> three<00:02:28.750> and<00:02:28.780> a<00:02:28.930> half

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
figures are between three and a half

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.470 
figures are between three and a half
four<00:02:29.380> inches<00:02:29.680> tall<00:02:29.950> this<00:02:30.880> guy<00:02:31.150> is<00:02:31.209> probably

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
four inches tall this guy is probably

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.590 
four inches tall this guy is probably
closer<00:02:31.900> to<00:02:32.160> six<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.310> a<00:02:33.370> half<00:02:33.400> seven<00:02:34.000> now

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
closer to six and a half seven now

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.060 
closer to six and a half seven now
that's<00:02:34.810> just<00:02:34.990> a<00:02:35.080> rough<00:02:35.230> estimate<00:02:35.650> I<00:02:35.770> haven't

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
that's just a rough estimate I haven't

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.540 
that's just a rough estimate I haven't
actually<00:02:36.459> measured<00:02:37.330> it<00:02:37.450> or<00:02:37.570> anything<00:02:38.550> but

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
actually measured it or anything but

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.510 
actually measured it or anything but
it's<00:02:39.700> a<00:02:39.850> it's<00:02:39.880> a<00:02:40.180> decent<00:02:40.570> sized<00:02:40.720> figure<00:02:41.520> and

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
it's a it's a decent sized figure and

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.310 
it's a it's a decent sized figure and
I'm<00:02:42.910> happy<00:02:43.240> but<00:02:43.330> like<00:02:43.570> I<00:02:43.690> said<00:02:43.750> I'm<00:02:43.959> happy<00:02:44.080> with

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
I'm happy but like I said I'm happy with

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.470 
I'm happy but like I said I'm happy with
what<00:02:44.470> they<00:02:44.590> did<00:02:44.650> combining<00:02:45.580> them<00:02:45.700> so

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
what they did combining them so

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.740 
what they did combining them so
articulation<00:02:47.380> wise<00:02:47.530> you<00:02:48.250> can<00:02:48.430> bend<00:02:48.790> here<00:02:49.630> I'll

do it on this leg you can bend the legs

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.020 
do it on this leg you can bend the legs
over<00:02:52.720> 90<00:02:52.989> degrees<00:02:53.290> back<00:02:53.560> there<00:02:53.830> and<00:02:54.459> back<00:02:54.760> down

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030

to<00:03:18.400> see<00:03:18.640> I<00:03:18.670> was<00:03:18.940> just<00:03:18.970> trying<00:03:19.330> to<00:03:19.450> get<00:03:20.200> all<00:03:20.380> of

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
to see I was just trying to get all of

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.850 
to see I was just trying to get all of
this<00:03:20.680> guy<00:03:20.830> in<00:03:21.010> the<00:03:21.130> frame<00:03:22.170> now<00:03:23.170> at<00:03:23.410> the<00:03:23.620> waist

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
this guy in the frame now at the waist

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.860 
this guy in the frame now at the waist
you<00:03:24.220> can<00:03:24.730> go<00:03:24.850> forward<00:03:25.420> a<00:03:25.570> little<00:03:25.600> bit

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
you can go forward a little bit

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.360 
you can go forward a little bit
backwards<00:03:26.650> a<00:03:26.739> little<00:03:26.769> bit

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
backwards a little bit

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.570 
backwards a little bit
you<00:03:27.790> can<00:03:27.910> turn<00:03:28.150> 360<00:03:28.959> degrees<00:03:29.440> there<00:03:30.040> so<00:03:30.519> you

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
you can turn 360 degrees there so you

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.250 
you can turn 360 degrees there so you
get<00:03:30.760> really<00:03:31.090> nice<00:03:31.299> moving<00:03:31.780> at<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:32.019> waist

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
get really nice moving at the waist

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.320 
get really nice moving at the waist
actually<00:03:32.980> and<00:03:33.130> I'm<00:03:33.220> quite<00:03:33.610> impressed<00:03:33.850> with

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
actually and I'm quite impressed with

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.680 
actually and I'm quite impressed with
that<00:03:34.360> to<00:03:34.660> be<00:03:34.780> completely<00:03:35.170> honest<00:03:36.330> now<00:03:37.330> this<00:03:37.510> is

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
that to be completely honest now this is

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.259 
that to be completely honest now this is
just<00:03:37.840> a<00:03:37.989> solid<00:03:38.170> block<00:03:38.560> but<00:03:39.220> the<00:03:39.400> V<00:03:39.670> Finn<00:03:39.940> does

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
just a solid block but the V Finn does

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:41.850 
just a solid block but the V Finn does
move<00:03:40.570> forward<00:03:40.600> and<00:03:41.049> back<00:03:41.200> so<00:03:41.410> if<00:03:41.500> there's<00:03:41.680> some

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
move forward and back so if there's some

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.520 
move forward and back so if there's some
position<00:03:42.280> you<00:03:42.430> prefer<00:03:42.850> then<00:03:43.810> by<00:03:44.320> all<00:03:44.350> means

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
position you prefer then by all means

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.400 
position you prefer then by all means
you<00:03:44.920> can<00:03:44.950> do<00:03:45.190> that<00:03:45.690> these<00:03:46.690> little<00:03:46.930> shoulder

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
you can do that these little shoulder

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.520 
you can do that these little shoulder
pieces<00:03:48.000> go<00:03:49.000> all<00:03:49.329> the<00:03:49.450> way<00:03:49.510> forth<00:03:50.200> and<00:03:50.410> back

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
pieces go all the way forth and back

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.949 
pieces go all the way forth and back
down<00:03:50.799> now<00:03:51.549> this<00:03:51.700> piece<00:03:51.880> keeps<00:03:52.180> popping<00:03:52.660> off<00:03:52.780> as

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
down now this piece keeps popping off as

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:54.509 
down now this piece keeps popping off as
I<00:03:53.079> mentioned<00:03:53.470> in<00:03:53.590> the<00:03:53.709> Bliss<00:03:53.950> Daman<00:03:54.190> review

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
I mentioned in the Bliss Daman review

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.569 
I mentioned in the Bliss Daman review
that<00:03:54.700> piece<00:03:55.030> pops<00:03:55.299> off<00:03:55.450> quite<00:03:55.810> easily<00:03:56.579> but

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
that piece pops off quite easily but

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:59.819 
that piece pops off quite easily but
that<00:03:57.700> does<00:03:57.940> go<00:03:58.120> up<00:03:58.329> and<00:03:58.480> down<00:03:58.630> just<00:03:59.410> like<00:03:59.590> the

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
that does go up and down just like the

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:05.479 
that does go up and down just like the
duralumin<00:04:00.630> side<00:04:01.630> goes<00:04:02.230> up<00:04:02.440> and<00:04:02.590> down<00:04:02.709> as<00:04:02.860> well

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:12.800 

now<00:04:06.489> let's<00:04:06.670> see<00:04:08.790> at<00:04:09.790> the<00:04:10.120> arm<00:04:10.330> they<00:04:11.319> can<00:04:11.349> go<00:04:11.980> 360

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
now let's see at the arm they can go 360

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.490 
now let's see at the arm they can go 360
just<00:04:13.810> a<00:04:13.870> little<00:04:14.140> bit<00:04:14.230> of<00:04:14.319> work<00:04:14.530> there<00:04:16.049> and<00:04:17.049> they

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
just a little bit of work there and they

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.550 
just a little bit of work there and they
can<00:04:17.680> go<00:04:17.829> up<00:04:18.100> and<00:04:19.090> in<00:04:19.510> and<00:04:19.720> out<00:04:19.810> just<00:04:19.840> a<00:04:20.169> tad<00:04:20.530> bit

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
can go up and in and out just a tad bit

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.620 
can go up and in and out just a tad bit
so<00:04:21.489> you<00:04:21.579> get<00:04:21.639> a<00:04:21.700> little<00:04:21.940> movement<00:04:22.120> there<00:04:22.300> and

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
so you get a little movement there and

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.070 
so you get a little movement there and
then<00:04:23.139> you<00:04:23.260> get<00:04:23.410> some<00:04:23.620> back<00:04:23.830> and<00:04:24.040> forth<00:04:24.130> as<00:04:24.580> well

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
then you get some back and forth as well

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.580 
then you get some back and forth as well
so<00:04:26.080> decent<00:04:26.350> movement<00:04:26.950> out<00:04:27.040> of<00:04:27.070> the<00:04:27.190> shoulders

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
so decent movement out of the shoulders

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.670 
so decent movement out of the shoulders
these<00:04:29.590> can<00:04:29.979> go<00:04:30.130> in<00:04:30.669> and<00:04:30.940> out<00:04:31.110> back<00:04:32.110> and<00:04:32.380> forth

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
these can go in and out back and forth

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.980 
these can go in and out back and forth
all<00:04:33.550> around<00:04:34.000> to<00:04:34.090> the<00:04:34.210> side<00:04:34.389> they're<00:04:34.660> just<00:04:34.840> on<00:04:34.960> a

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
all around to the side they're just on a

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.870 
all around to the side they're just on a
single<00:04:35.350> ball<00:04:35.470> joint<00:04:35.800> there<00:04:36.010> make<00:04:36.700> it<00:04:36.790> this

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
single ball joint there make it this

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.969 
single ball joint there make it this
turned<00:04:37.150> around<00:04:37.270> so<00:04:38.139> that's<00:04:38.229> not<00:04:38.440> too<00:04:38.800> bad<00:04:38.919> a

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
turned around so that's not too bad a

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:42.780 
turned around so that's not too bad a
movement<00:04:39.630> arms<00:04:40.630> can<00:04:40.900> go<00:04:40.930> in<00:04:41.590> and<00:04:41.800> out<00:04:41.889> for<00:04:42.760> a

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
movement arms can go in and out for a

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.440 
movement arms can go in and out for a
better<00:04:42.970> view<00:04:43.210> in<00:04:43.990> and<00:04:44.139> out<00:04:44.229> about<00:04:44.440> that<00:04:44.650> far

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
better view in and out about that far

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.890 
better view in and out about that far
that<00:04:46.450> far<00:04:47.100> and<00:04:48.100> if<00:04:48.700> you<00:04:49.300> feel<00:04:49.479> like<00:04:49.690> moving

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
that far and if you feel like moving

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.610 
that far and if you feel like moving
this<00:04:50.490> so<00:04:51.490> that<00:04:51.729> it's<00:04:51.850> a<00:04:52.030> straight<00:04:52.930> thing<00:04:53.200> it

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
this so that it's a straight thing it

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.440 
this so that it's a straight thing it
can<00:04:53.740> go<00:04:53.860> a<00:04:53.889> whole<00:04:53.950> lot<00:04:54.130> farther<00:04:54.520> forward<00:04:54.850> so

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
can go a whole lot farther forward so

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.600 
can go a whole lot farther forward so
you<00:04:55.510> really<00:04:55.900> get<00:04:56.080> any<00:04:56.740> kind<00:04:57.130> of<00:04:57.190> movement<00:04:57.370> you

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
you really get any kind of movement you

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.810 
you really get any kind of movement you
could<00:04:57.760> ever<00:04:57.880> want<00:04:58.150> out<00:04:58.450> of<00:04:58.750> all<00:04:59.620> the<00:05:00.340> joints<00:05:00.550> on

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
could ever want out of all the joints on

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.280 
could ever want out of all the joints on
the<00:05:01.060> arm<00:05:01.240> there<00:05:01.479> so<00:05:01.630> that's<00:05:01.780> actually<00:05:02.020> quite

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
the arm there so that's actually quite

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.020 
the arm there so that's actually quite
impressive

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
impressive

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.010 
impressive
the<00:05:04.389> head<00:05:04.630> can<00:05:05.350> move<00:05:05.380> 360<00:05:05.800> as<00:05:06.250> well<00:05:06.660> up<00:05:07.660> down

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
the head can move 360 as well up down

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.510 
the head can move 360 as well up down
quite<00:05:08.740> a<00:05:08.770> ways<00:05:09.030> to<00:05:10.030> each<00:05:10.360> side<00:05:11.039> not<00:05:12.039> bad<00:05:12.280> there

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
quite a ways to each side not bad there

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.000 
quite a ways to each side not bad there
at<00:05:12.639> all<00:05:12.729> and<00:05:13.139> then<00:05:14.139> the<00:05:14.410> little<00:05:14.620> backpack

anywhere you want so honestly the
articulation<00:05:27.820> on<00:05:27.940> this<00:05:28.120> figure<00:05:28.389> is<00:05:28.510> pretty

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
articulation on this figure is pretty

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.850 
articulation on this figure is pretty
impressive<00:05:29.229> and<00:05:29.830> I'm<00:05:30.520> happy<00:05:30.910> with<00:05:30.940> the<00:05:31.860> looks

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860

impressive and I'm happy with the looks
of<00:05:33.070> the<00:05:33.130> figure<00:05:34.680> honestly<00:05:35.680> based<00:05:36.130> off<00:05:36.430> of<00:05:37.380> this

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
of the figure honestly based off of this

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.050 
of the figure honestly based off of this
line<00:05:38.590> of<00:05:38.620> figures<00:05:38.860> I<00:05:39.010> would<00:05:39.400> have<00:05:39.490> expected

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
line of figures I would have expected

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.820 
line of figures I would have expected
something<00:05:40.690> that<00:05:40.930> didn't<00:05:41.260> even<00:05:41.320> look<00:05:41.500> this

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
something that didn't even look this

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.640 
something that didn't even look this
good<00:05:42.070> so<00:05:42.850> I<00:05:43.210> am<00:05:43.240> very<00:05:43.870> happy<00:05:44.080> with<00:05:44.260> what<00:05:44.530> they

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
good so I am very happy with what they

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.600 
good so I am very happy with what they
did<00:05:44.860> and<00:05:45.070> I<00:05:45.130> think<00:05:45.190> it<00:05:45.520> is<00:05:46.270> a<00:05:46.300> quality<00:05:46.990> job

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
did and I think it is a quality job

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.370 
did and I think it is a quality job
these<00:05:49.240> figures<00:05:49.570> are<00:05:49.599> nine<00:05:49.960> dollars

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
these figures are nine dollars

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.800 
these figures are nine dollars
individually<00:05:50.789> so<00:05:51.789> if<00:05:51.910> you<00:05:52.030> wanted<00:05:52.300> to<00:05:52.450> come

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
individually so if you wanted to come

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.750 
individually so if you wanted to come
put<00:05:52.990> this<00:05:53.139> guy<00:05:53.320> together<00:05:53.500> at<00:05:53.919> retail<00:05:54.340> price<00:05:54.550> it

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:54.760 
put this guy together at retail price it

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.800 
put this guy together at retail price it
would<00:05:54.849> be<00:05:55.050> 27<00:05:56.849> not<00:05:57.849> a<00:05:57.880> bad<00:05:58.120> price<00:05:58.389> in<00:05:58.630> my

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
would be 27 not a bad price in my

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.020 
would be 27 not a bad price in my
opinion<00:05:59.320> these<00:05:59.919> figures<00:06:00.370> are<00:06:00.610> decently

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
opinion these figures are decently

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.790 
opinion these figures are decently
sizable<00:06:02.020> and<00:06:02.169> have<00:06:03.330> good<00:06:04.330> value<00:06:04.720> to<00:06:04.870> them<00:06:04.990> as<00:06:05.740> a

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
sizable and have good value to them as a

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.529 
sizable and have good value to them as a
Digimon<00:06:06.370> collector<00:06:06.789> at<00:06:06.880> least<00:06:07.030> I'm<00:06:07.240> quite

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:07.539 
Digimon collector at least I'm quite

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:09.870 
Digimon collector at least I'm quite
happy<00:06:07.780> to<00:06:08.080> have<00:06:08.260> them<00:06:08.440> and<00:06:08.620> I<00:06:09.370> think<00:06:09.430> they<00:06:09.820> were

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 
happy to have them and I think they were

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.900 
happy to have them and I think they were
definitely<00:06:10.510> worth<00:06:10.840> the<00:06:10.870> $9<00:06:11.710> each<00:06:11.860> a<00:06:12.460> lot

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:12.910 
definitely worth the $9 each a lot

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.190 
definitely worth the $9 each a lot
better<00:06:13.120> than<00:06:13.270> the<00:06:13.360> other<00:06:13.479> kind<00:06:13.720> of<00:06:13.780> toys<00:06:13.960> these

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:14.200 
better than the other kind of toys these

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.459 
better than the other kind of toys these
days<00:06:14.380> so<00:06:15.340> this<00:06:16.180> is<00:06:16.539> Shoutmon<00:06:17.320> x4

00:06:18.459 --> 00:06:18.469 
days so this is Shoutmon x4

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:19.959 
days so this is Shoutmon x4
go<00:06:18.830> ahead<00:06:18.949> and<00:06:19.069> put<00:06:19.219> a<00:06:19.249> sword<00:06:19.580> in<00:06:19.789> his<00:06:19.909> hand

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:23.830 
here hopefully we get some further

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.919 
here hopefully we get some further
variance<00:06:24.830> of<00:06:25.069> these<00:06:25.399> guys<00:06:25.699> and<00:06:26.059> in<00:06:26.539> addition

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:26.929 
variance of these guys and in addition

00:06:26.929 --> 00:06:30.009 
variance of these guys and in addition
to<00:06:26.959> this<00:06:27.139> we<00:06:27.379> also<00:06:27.559> have<00:06:27.979> a<00:06:28.300> male<00:06:29.300> bird<00:06:29.659> German

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:33.830 
and a Greymon figure that I also have

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.499 
and a Greymon figure that I also have
the<00:06:34.009> review<00:06:34.339> and<00:06:34.550> they<00:06:34.699> will<00:06:34.849> combine<00:06:35.029> into<00:06:35.389> a

00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:35.509 
the review and they will combine into a

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:38.259 
the review and they will combine into a
metal<00:06:35.869> Greymon<00:06:36.229> so<00:06:37.009> a<00:06:37.309> lot<00:06:37.789> of<00:06:37.969> different
