00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.539
 gallant greeting my name is bernardo mothers 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:18.530
 I'm now rolling 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:19.820
 miguel lines 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.579
 we just made a fight 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:25.579
 with this my friend sergio flavorio 

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:30.020
 the result to the sun god because I pulled a separate 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:30.929
 pm 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.640
 from my plane 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.620
 no, well we are now 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.550
 percent and collecting the 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.550
 the lines that governs in him 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.440
 the combat are two models 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.350
 polanco at the same time 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.960
 and so 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.950
 is that an airplane with the propeller 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.770
 the tiahuanaco ribbon removes the mayor of each of the planes 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.990
 Perez the first one to take cuts the ribbon wins 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.579
 or is that it can start some part of the plane as is the case 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.500
 what sergio did with the device in 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.580
 the one that was flying me 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.310
 that are at the same time combat wing 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.240
 that fly very limiting death 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.950
 100 kilometers per hour 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.860
 gft been very attentive 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.630
 for one to avoid the 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.630
 the blow of the companion that is approaching 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.500
 all that has to be distanced enough but in this case it was not him but 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.870
 with me I did not do it enough 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.650
 and ended up attacking months 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.310
 a part of the wing like 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.080
 now we go birds 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.400
 and in this case I have to say that the precept they bridge hours that 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.210
 he won 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.860
 the fight 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.740
 he commented on many years ago 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.080
 fl 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.620
 he won him 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.909
 the sls there is also nothing more or less something similar 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.800
 reads from the plane he had in the air 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.570
 that work that several times 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.350
 then we can say that now he 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.200
 this 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.250
 that's why he took revenge 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.310
 and he did him 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.890
 the damage then was let's go we're tie you can say 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.289
 a plane destroyed cover 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.009
 for each side although this device 

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:16.199
 By the way there was can be recovered because the damage is 

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:17.309
 the damage is less 

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:19.269
 and if you want what 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:20.460
 they can not take 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.909
 and how well I took part 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:23.949
 part the wing 

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:26.749
 happily the plane continued to fly 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:30.049
 but in the case of in some years not 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.369
 this is the pretext of them completely 

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:35.869
 two one-on-one payouts in this bout 

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:38.789
 once 

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:41.379
 houses 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.379
 Photo 

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:50.769
 of a version of one of the varieties of flight control lines that is 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.439
 known as combat 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:55.529
 this is rather the kind of slow combat 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.689
 because there is a combat that will be done with very sophisticated engines 

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:02.350
 i 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.079
 that develop a lot of speed the planes 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:09.599
 that is not me personally I like more the slow combat because it is 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.459
 more enjoyable for the public that can see better than what is 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:13.609
 going 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:17.419
 I can take sides and I go with the red plane myself and the orange 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:19.809
 yes 

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:23.119
 it's about following each other 

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:24.370
 cut the tail 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.680
 with the propeller the paper tail that takes the strip of paper that takes marra 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.519
 to the 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.369
 to the fuselage of the plane 

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:35.319
 without cutting the plane ropes 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.589
 it is not in fact carlos aaiÃºn a shock in which I hit him and cut him 

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:42.329
 a piece of humala 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.239
 to him without either of them leaving the air 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:46.609
 That was good 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:49.869
 why it did not happen from a small collision 

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:54.329
 so I touched her I managed to touch the paper tape of him in an opportunity but 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.449
 not him not crazy not with the propeller surely with a wing 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.779
 sense porthole touched him 

00:04:00.779 --> 00:04:05.469
 which is one of the modalities one of the advantages of line control 

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:07.850
 if one feels the plane not as in 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.259
 remote control 

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:15.559
 that the connections by means of radio waves 10 very separate from it 

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:18.289
 the pilot of the plane very independent 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:21.579
 in this case the combat very entertaining for the public 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.439
 and it's the first time we have a fight 

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:28.729
 seriously let's say it with tails and with 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:31.539
 with airplanes designed to fight 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:35.089
 previously many years ago he had flown with the same bernardo 

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:39.379
 by the way a flight from another with two planes but two aerobatic planes 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:41.949
 slower and 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:44.949
 for him to learn, but that was more than 20 years ago 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:48.639
 and on that occasion he entrusted me with the plane 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:51.370
 now it was my turn to break them 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.590
 as a kind of revenge 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.250
 to good here is the fact was another lack the ap 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.960
 the piece of lead 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.349
 sl lost a piece of lead 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:03.830
 that he carries in the wing for against to 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.210
 make a balance 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.559
 you need for the weight of the ropes 

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:12.379
 Per hundred whenever there is an event like that we try to make a fight 

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:16.669
 because it is very attractive to the public 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:19.969
 and we also enjoy it a lot 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:23.039
 the other modality that we practice that acrobatics 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:27.539
 is not very entertaining for the public because they do not understand they do not know what kind 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:29.860
 what are the maneuvers he is doing 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.909
 the one who is with the plane medina many times they say to her what will happen 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:35.349
 made and it's going to break 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:37.620
 and it's part of the routine 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.840
 that in acrobatics you have to perform 15 different maneuvers since takeoff 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.620
 until landing 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.069
 and all counts are scored by the judges 

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:52.830
 percent the acrobatics judges sink some things the combat judges 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:53.809
 I come to other 

00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:55.689
 test of combat measure 

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:58.699
 count the cuts of the tape 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:01.129
 the time it is in the air 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:06.840
 i ghana the tec the there will be more bush cuts and there are no cuts out there have the 

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:09.839
 same number of cuts wins the one that is more time in the air 

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:14.300
 so for a while in the air I won because I came out first and art of 

00:06:14.299 --> 00:06:16.539
 seduce 

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:18.460
 so it is that 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.480
 that was what we could make hear to entertain them with this modality 

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:26.900
 and there we will explain them at any other time 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.650
 more about line control 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.759
 and it is a very different modality from radio control 

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:34.689
 but 

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:36.539
 It has several advantages 

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:39.539
 first of all that one flies in a very small space 

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:44.110
 you do not need wide open spaces to fly radio 

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:47.339
 and after that it is very cheap 

00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:51.879
 the investment at least this one since this is me right now that means a 

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:54.879
 investment of about 12 13 thousand dollars 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:56.919
 neither 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:06:59.169
 a small plane after combat 

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:02.550
 it is a little estortero fontelo get one in the hardware store 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.350
 some walesa tablets and a motor really comes out very cheap 

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:09.949
 i have fun 1 healthy
