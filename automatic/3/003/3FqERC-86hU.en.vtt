00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
and of course then the crew trips we go

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.680 
and of course then the crew trips we go
explore<00:01:48.460> those<00:01:48.670> nests<00:01:49.090> and<00:01:49.150> find<00:01:49.390> the<00:01:49.510> big

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.820 
white sea bass in yellowtail and that
really<00:01:52.390> disappeared<00:01:53.050> for<00:01:53.260> a<00:01:53.320> while<00:01:53.380> but<00:01:53.710> why

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
really disappeared for a while but why

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.580 
really disappeared for a while but why
this<00:01:53.890> all<00:01:54.190> came<00:01:54.430> back<00:01:54.700> the<00:01:55.270> last<00:01:55.300> four<00:01:56.170> five

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
this all came back the last four five

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.330 
this all came back the last four five
years<00:01:56.650> now<00:01:57.220> would<00:01:58.180> be<00:01:58.290> putting<00:01:59.290> a<00:01:59.440> lot<00:02:00.070> of<00:02:00.100> work

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
years now would be putting a lot of work

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.550 
years now would be putting a lot of work
back<00:02:00.610> into<00:02:00.880> the<00:02:01.060> Sun<00:02:01.210> the<00:02:01.450> same<00:02:01.660> old<00:02:01.900> areas<00:02:02.290> and

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
back into the Sun the same old areas and

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.710 
back into the Sun the same old areas and
going<00:02:02.830> back<00:02:03.040> in<00:02:03.340> I<00:02:03.700> think<00:02:04.030> one<00:02:04.240> thing<00:02:04.480> that

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
going back in I think one thing that

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.020 
going back in I think one thing that
people<00:02:05.260> do<00:02:05.680> is<00:02:05.710> they<00:02:06.070> wait<00:02:06.280> to<00:02:06.490> see<00:02:06.670> a<00:02:06.700> light

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
people do is they wait to see a light

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.029 
people do is they wait to see a light
boat<00:02:07.300> or<00:02:07.480> an<00:02:07.570> Internet<00:02:07.930> report<00:02:08.379> before<00:02:08.709> they

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
boat or an Internet report before they

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.830 
boat or an Internet report before they
go<00:02:09.190> out<00:02:09.399> and<00:02:09.610> fish<00:02:09.879> these<00:02:10.090> nests<00:02:10.599> and<00:02:10.750> these

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
go out and fish these nests and these

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.510 
go out and fish these nests and these
things<00:02:11.020> are<00:02:11.260> popping<00:02:11.680> up<00:02:11.770> and<00:02:11.980> down<00:02:12.099> the<00:02:12.280> coast

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
things are popping up and down the coast

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.259 
things are popping up and down the coast
all<00:02:13.480> up<00:02:13.780> and<00:02:13.930> down<00:02:14.050> the<00:02:14.200> coast<00:02:14.470> so<00:02:14.790> I<00:02:15.790> think

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
all up and down the coast so I think

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:17.880 
all up and down the coast so I think
there's<00:02:16.510> a<00:02:16.569> real<00:02:16.810> good<00:02:16.989> opportunity<00:02:17.650> for<00:02:17.680> a

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
there's a real good opportunity for a

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.680 
there's a real good opportunity for a

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
little bit of movement if we have a lot

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.340 
little bit of movement if we have a lot
of<00:03:09.470> current<00:03:09.800> well<00:03:09.980> we'll<00:03:10.670> put<00:03:11.030> a<00:03:11.060> bigger

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
of current well we'll put a bigger

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.690 
of current well we'll put a bigger
sinker<00:03:12.350> on<00:03:12.380> if<00:03:12.680> we<00:03:12.770> just<00:03:12.980> have<00:03:13.100> a<00:03:13.130> tat<00:03:13.400> occur

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
sinker on if we just have a tat occur

sinker on if we just have a tat occur
and<00:03:13.820> a<00:03:13.850> lot<00:03:14.000> of<00:03:14.060> times<00:03:14.240> we'll<00:03:14.360> go<00:03:14.480> fly<00:03:14.810> line

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
and a lot of times we'll go fly line

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.220 
and a lot of times we'll go fly line
remember<00:03:15.380> fly<00:03:15.800> line<00:03:16.010> means<00:03:16.420> just<00:03:17.420> a<00:03:17.600> hook<00:03:17.870> to<00:03:18.200> a

and<00:03:25.430> what<00:03:26.000> I<00:03:26.030> was<00:03:26.210> talking<00:03:26.600> about<00:03:26.660> by

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
and what I was talking about by

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.030 
and what I was talking about by
threading<00:03:27.860> these<00:03:28.160> is<00:03:29.410> get<00:03:30.410> the<00:03:30.560> point<00:03:30.860> in

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
threading these is get the point in

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.910 
threading these is get the point in
there<00:03:31.310> you<00:03:31.670> literally<00:03:31.970> curve<00:03:32.420> it<00:03:32.570> around<00:03:32.920> pop

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
there you literally curve it around pop

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.420 
there you literally curve it around pop
it<00:03:34.100> back<00:03:34.130> out<00:03:34.610> I<00:03:34.910> incur<00:03:35.570> the<00:03:35.860> knot<00:03:36.860> right<00:03:36.890> in<00:03:37.280> my

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
it back out I incur the knot right in my

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.540 
it back out I incur the knot right in my
squid<00:03:38.260> and<00:03:39.260> that's<00:03:39.560> how<00:03:39.770> much<00:03:39.950> hook<00:03:40.190> I<00:03:40.370> got

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
squid and that's how much hook I got

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.340 
squid and that's how much hook I got
sticking<00:03:40.970> out<00:03:41.090> of<00:03:41.240> my<00:03:41.270> squid<00:03:41.720> now<00:03:41.930> if<00:03:42.080> I<00:03:42.140> want

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
sticking out of my squid now if I want

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.800 
sticking out of my squid now if I want
to<00:03:42.440> put<00:03:42.590> a<00:03:42.620> second<00:03:43.100> squid<00:03:43.400> on<00:03:43.580> here<00:03:43.850> even<00:03:44.720> a

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
to put a second squid on here even a

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.320 
to put a second squid on here even a
small<00:03:45.140> one<00:03:45.459> should<00:03:46.459> literally<00:03:46.850> make<00:03:47.090> that

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
small one should literally make that

hook<00:03:47.600> I<00:03:48.370> mean<00:03:49.370> it<00:03:49.580> just<00:03:49.790> practically

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
hook I mean it just practically

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.390 
hook I mean it just practically
disappears<00:03:50.930> we<00:03:51.170> should<00:03:51.350> chew<00:03:51.500> chew<00:03:51.709> it's<00:03:51.890> so

the<00:05:08.590> hook<00:05:08.740> just<00:05:08.979> like<00:05:09.100> you<00:05:09.310> would<00:05:09.490> normally

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
the hook just like you would normally

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.570 
the hook just like you would normally

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
fish in the lead heads really gives you

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.909 
fish in the lead heads really gives you
squid<00:05:12.910> some<00:05:13.150> movement<00:05:13.630> and<00:05:14.169> also<00:05:14.289> when<00:05:14.620> squid

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
squid some movement and also when squid

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:17.010 
squid some movement and also when squid
spawn<00:05:15.310> it<00:05:15.610> almost<00:05:15.880> looks<00:05:16.180> like<00:05:16.270> they<00:05:16.570> all<00:05:16.750> have

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020

they're really using their other senses
when<00:05:38.889> they<00:05:38.979> eat<00:05:39.160> the<00:05:39.280> bait<00:05:39.490> whether<00:05:40.450> it<00:05:40.600> be

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
when they eat the bait whether it be

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.110 
when they eat the bait whether it be
their<00:05:40.870> sense<00:05:41.139> of<00:05:41.289> smell<00:05:41.470> or<00:05:41.760> whatever<00:05:42.760> it<00:05:42.940> is

but they're not seeing the line we even
go<00:05:45.160> up<00:05:45.340> to<00:05:45.550> 80<00:05:45.880> pound<00:05:46.330> fluorocarbon<00:05:47.169> sometimes

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:47.979
