00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
another on f1 2013 and one thinking of

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.220 
another on f1 2013 and one thinking of
doing<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:49.950> opening<00:00:50.160> up<00:00:50.489> another<00:00:50.700> league<00:00:51.239> lot

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
doing is opening up another league lot

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.090 
doing is opening up another league lot
of<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.980> big<00:00:53.160> leagues<00:00:53.430> tgp<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.480> ARL<00:00:55.379> i<00:00:55.680> think

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
of the big leagues tgp and ARL i think

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.619 
of the big leagues tgp and ARL i think
they<00:00:56.190> do<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.370> similar<00:00:56.640> system<00:00:56.969> where<00:00:57.329> they<00:00:57.449> have

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
they do a similar system where they have

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.990 
they do a similar system where they have
two<00:00:57.930> leagues<00:00:58.260> or<00:00:58.500> even<00:00:58.770> more<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.489> have<00:00:59.609> you

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
two leagues or even more to have you

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.939 
two leagues or even more to have you
know<00:01:00.090> fulfilled<00:01:00.449> speeds<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:01.050> all<00:01:01.289> drivers<00:01:01.680> so

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
know fulfilled speeds of all drivers so

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.549 
know fulfilled speeds of all drivers so
everybody<00:01:02.370> can<00:01:02.640> race<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:04.110> think<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.470> would

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
everybody can race and I think it would

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.080 
everybody can race and I think it would
be<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.680> good<00:01:04.860> thing<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.100> open<00:01:05.460> up<00:01:05.549> for<00:01:05.729> mine<00:01:05.909> as

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
be a good thing to open up for mine as

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.880 
be a good thing to open up for mine as
well<00:01:06.119> as<00:01:06.360> we<00:01:06.510> get<00:01:06.630> more<00:01:06.659> people<00:01:07.140> racing<00:01:07.590> in<00:01:07.770> the

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
well as we get more people racing in the

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.130 
well as we get more people racing in the
league<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.700> all<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.659> people<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.049> ain't

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140
