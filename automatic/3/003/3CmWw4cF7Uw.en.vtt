take your finger is to get a high
Caribbean<00:01:36.509> right<00:01:36.780> down<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.110> middle<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.619> then

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
Caribbean right down the middle and then

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.830 
Caribbean right down the middle and then
you're<00:01:38.670> just<00:01:38.759> going<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.000> kind<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.210> pull<00:01:39.570> this

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
you're just going to kind of pull this

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.920 
you're just going to kind of pull this
out<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.470> create<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:41.040> little<00:01:41.310> gap<00:01:41.549> here<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:42.210> then

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
out to create a little gap here and then

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.039 
out to create a little gap here and then
you<00:01:43.079> spin<00:01:43.560> this<00:01:44.159> pointy<00:01:44.640> tail<00:01:44.909> up<00:01:45.320> and<00:01:46.320> through

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
you spin this pointy tail up and through

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.300 
you spin this pointy tail up and through
so<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.110> looks<00:01:49.290> like<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.920> I'm<00:01:50.100> going<00:01:50.250> to

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.060 
so it looks like that and I'm going to
take<00:01:50.549> this<00:01:50.820> really<00:01:51.390> good<00:01:54.470> so<00:01:55.470> I'll<00:01:55.740> put<00:01:55.979> that
