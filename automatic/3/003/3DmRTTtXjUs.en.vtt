going to talk about how to treat a
urinary<00:00:06.080> tract<00:00:06.380> infection<00:00:07.010> or<00:00:07.189> UTI<00:00:07.360> for<00:00:08.360> short

urinary tract infection or UTI for short

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.500 
urinary tract infection or UTI for short
in<00:00:09.050> a<00:00:09.200> pediatric<00:00:09.770> patient<00:00:09.800> now<00:00:10.790> what<00:00:11.120> you<00:00:11.270> do

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:11.510 
in a pediatric patient now what you do

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.860 
in a pediatric patient now what you do
depends<00:00:12.260> a<00:00:12.410> lot<00:00:12.740> on<00:00:12.800> who<00:00:13.550> the<00:00:13.700> patient<00:00:14.090> is<00:00:14.330> how

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:14.870 
depends a lot on who the patient is how

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.050 
depends a lot on who the patient is how
old<00:00:15.140> they<00:00:15.410> are<00:00:15.440> whether<00:00:16.160> they're<00:00:16.400> a<00:00:16.460> boy<00:00:16.760> or<00:00:17.029> a

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
old they are whether they're a boy or a

girl and what the nature of the urinary
tract<00:00:20.359> infection<00:00:20.929> is<00:00:21.079> so<00:00:21.409> the<00:00:21.980> big

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
tract infection is so the big

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:24.339 
tract infection is so the big
distinction<00:00:22.849> we<00:00:23.179> want<00:00:23.449> to<00:00:23.539> make<00:00:23.720> is<00:00:24.050> whether

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:24.349 
distinction we want to make is whether

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:26.380 
distinction we want to make is whether
we<00:00:24.529> think<00:00:24.560> the<00:00:24.859> kidneys<00:00:25.429> are<00:00:25.579> infected<00:00:26.150> or

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
aggressively usually with injected

infection likewise when that happens we

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.710 
infection likewise when that happens we
want<00:00:49.340> to<00:00:49.430> do<00:00:49.520> some<00:00:49.700> follow-up<00:00:50.060> studies<00:00:50.540> to

make sure that the kidneys the bladder

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.910 
make sure that the kidneys the bladder
and<00:00:52.850> the<00:00:53.210> ureters<00:00:53.690> that<00:00:53.960> connect<00:00:54.410> the<00:00:54.530> kidneys

we shoot a little dye up in the bladder

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.180 
we shoot a little dye up in the bladder
and<00:01:11.180> make<00:01:11.630> sure<00:01:11.840> that<00:01:11.960> it<00:01:12.080> doesn't<00:01:12.440> reflux
