00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
blood and it is by gizmo ray which is a

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.000 
blood and it is by gizmo ray which is a
pretty<00:00:16.020> cool<00:00:16.170> name<00:00:16.230> I<00:00:16.440> upset

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
pretty cool name I upset

and<00:00:17.609> what<00:00:18.480> this<00:00:18.570> plane<00:00:18.779> does<00:00:19.080> is<00:00:19.460> fairly

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
and what this plane does is fairly

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.910 
and what this plane does is fairly
simple<00:00:20.970> in<00:00:21.210> terms<00:00:21.270> of<00:00:21.630> its<00:00:21.720> operation<00:00:22.140> what<00:00:22.830> it

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
simple in terms of its operation what it

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.269 
simple in terms of its operation what it
does<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.250> if<00:00:23.580> you<00:00:24.210> hit<00:00:24.480> another<00:00:24.720> player<00:00:25.230> or<00:00:25.710> mob

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
does is if you hit another player or mob

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.730 
does is if you hit another player or mob
with<00:00:27.240> something<00:00:27.840> that<00:00:27.960> gives<00:00:28.109> of<00:00:28.230> sufficient

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
with something that gives of sufficient

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.880 
with something that gives of sufficient
damage<00:00:29.099> they<00:00:30.029> will<00:00:30.359> give<00:00:30.660> blood<00:00:31.170> particle

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
damage they will give blood particle

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:41.990 
damage they will give blood particle
effects<00:00:38.210> I<00:00:39.260> did<00:00:40.290> but<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.710> also<00:00:40.860> know<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.850> you

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
effects I did but you also know and you

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.240 
effects I did but you also know and you
all<00:00:42.120> want<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.570> do<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.710> dropped<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.950> head<00:00:44.100> but

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
all want to do and it dropped a head but

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.930 
all want to do and it dropped a head but
that<00:00:44.280> isn't<00:00:44.610> polar<00:00:45.890> but<00:00:46.890> yeah<00:00:49.850> so<00:00:50.850> that's

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
that isn't polar but yeah so that's

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.119 
that isn't polar but yeah so that's
pretty<00:00:51.570> much<00:00:51.660> what<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:51.960> does<00:00:52.110> um<00:00:52.320> except<00:00:53.010> it's

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
pretty much what it does um except it's

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.470

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
there we gonna mole blood effects as you

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.580 
there we gonna mole blood effects as you
saw<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.720> overhead<00:01:11.570> slash<00:01:12.570> mob<00:01:12.960> what's<00:01:13.439> your

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
saw and overhead slash mob what's your

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.160 
saw and overhead slash mob what's your
small<00:01:13.860> skeleton<00:01:14.750> you<00:01:15.750> might<00:01:15.869> want<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.049> make<00:01:16.140> a

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
small skeleton you might want to make a

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:23.990 
small skeleton you might want to make a
night<00:01:16.380> not<00:01:16.799> surely<00:01:17.070> good<00:01:17.700> point<00:01:22.880> that's<00:01:23.880> the

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
night not surely good point that's the

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.090 
night not surely good point that's the
point<00:01:24.210> when<00:01:24.540> is<00:01:24.659> when<00:01:25.020> it's<00:01:25.170> daytime<00:01:25.380> do<00:01:25.979> they

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
point when is when it's daytime do they

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.120 
point when is when it's daytime do they
have<00:01:26.220> blood<00:01:26.369> effects<00:01:27.470> yeah<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.500> think<00:01:28.770> they<00:01:29.009> do

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
have blood effects yeah I think they do

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.260 
have blood effects yeah I think they do
yes<00:01:29.369> let's<00:01:29.939> do<00:01:30.090> that

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
yes let's do that

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.840 
yes let's do that
I<00:01:30.390> mean<00:01:30.630> as<00:01:30.900> in<00:01:31.079> do<00:01:31.439> they<00:01:31.590> burn<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.280> then<00:01:32.460> bleed

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
I mean as in do they burn and then bleed

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:47.929 
I mean as in do they burn and then bleed
no<00:01:42.649> lightning<00:01:43.649> hours<00:01:43.860> again<00:01:44.250> end<00:01:44.490> up<00:01:44.579> an<00:01:46.939> arrow

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
no lightning hours again end up an arrow

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.260 
no lightning hours again end up an arrow
in<00:01:48.210> your<00:01:48.270> foot<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:49.290> see<00:01:49.799> only<00:01:50.040> my<00:01:50.759> side

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
in your foot I see only my side

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.209 
in your foot I see only my side
you<00:01:51.540> do<00:01:51.750> yeah<00:01:53.479> but<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.860> suppose<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.040> blood

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
you do yeah but I suppose the blood

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.800 
you do yeah but I suppose the blood
doesn't<00:01:56.399> really<00:01:56.579> make<00:01:56.790> sense<00:01:56.969> for<00:01:57.270> skeletons

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
doesn't really make sense for skeletons

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.990 
doesn't really make sense for skeletons
because<00:01:58.170> they<00:01:58.350> don't<00:01:58.619> have<00:01:58.770> any<00:01:59.250> blood

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
because they don't have any blood

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.719 
because they don't have any blood
vessels<00:02:00.360> but<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.439> doesn't<00:02:01.710> matter<00:02:01.829> because<00:02:02.100> it

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
vessels but it doesn't matter because it

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.060 
vessels but it doesn't matter because it
worked<00:02:02.969> for<00:02:03.060> ender<00:02:03.479> dragons<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:04.079> was<00:02:04.740> thinking

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
worked for ender dragons I was thinking

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.540 
worked for ender dragons I was thinking
something<00:02:05.700> let's<00:02:06.329> try<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.689> oh<00:02:07.020> no<00:02:07.979> we<00:02:08.399> can

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
something let's try it oh no we can

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.050 
something let's try it oh no we can
interface<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:08.970> landscape

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
interface a landscape

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.410 
interface a landscape
or<00:02:10.149> gospel<00:02:10.599> killer<00:02:12.310> I<00:02:12.340> think<00:02:12.940> we<00:02:13.000> count<00:02:13.239> it'll

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
or gospel killer I think we count it'll

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.870 
or gospel killer I think we count it'll
be<00:02:13.480> fine<00:02:13.660> here<00:02:13.870> we<00:02:13.930> got<00:02:14.110> your<00:02:14.410> on<00:02:14.739> Watson<00:02:15.099> oh<00:02:15.250> I

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
be fine here we got your on Watson oh I

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.430 
be fine here we got your on Watson oh I
was<00:02:16.150> gonna<00:02:16.239> blow<00:02:16.480> things<00:02:16.690> up<00:02:16.900> cuz<00:02:17.080> well<00:02:17.260> that

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
was gonna blow things up cuz well that

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:31.020 
was gonna blow things up cuz well that
would<00:02:17.530> be<00:02:17.560> even<00:02:17.800> worse<00:02:17.980> here<00:02:18.970> we<00:02:19.030> go<00:02:19.180> oh<00:02:28.140> oh<00:02:30.030> oh

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
would be even worse here we go oh oh oh

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.089 
would be even worse here we go oh oh oh
actually<00:02:31.180> I<00:02:31.390> think<00:02:31.540> it<00:02:31.599> might<00:02:31.750> do<00:02:31.870> it<00:02:32.470> I<00:02:32.709> don't

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
actually I think it might do it I don't

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.390 
actually I think it might do it I don't
know<00:02:33.310> it's<00:02:33.459> giving<00:02:33.700> off<00:02:33.760> something<00:02:35.340> all<00:02:36.340> right

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
know it's giving off something all right

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:59.220 
know it's giving off something all right
let<00:02:36.610> me<00:02:36.640> increase<00:02:36.940> my<00:02:37.030> speed<00:02:41.040> something<00:02:58.230> it
