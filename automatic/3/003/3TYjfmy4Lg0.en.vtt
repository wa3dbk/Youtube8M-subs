00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:15.490
 Hello Japanese technology think again and really amazing 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:21.870
 apr19 Kumamoto City's jr Kyushu Kumamoto General Vehicle Station was released to the press 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:27.890
 Free gauge train that can change the distance between wheels according to the track width 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:27.890
 Then it is time for a little bit of knowing pb 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:01:00.340
 The color is red and yellow tones and the wired type new of or train may seem to look normal Shinkansen of Vail 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:05.550
 Shinkansen with different skin 1435 mm 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:14.430
 Can run both 10 and 1067 mm 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:18.840
 Country- led development started in 1990, which was the third test car 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:23.210
 Crushed things that reach up to 270 km / h 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:31.829
 Equivalent examination started from the first day dawn 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:33.750
 Posting a total of 600,000 Hiro over the three years leading up to fiscal 2016 to investigate safety and durability 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:38.860
 It is a policy 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:47.740
 The Nagasaki route is between Hakata Shin Tosu and Take Onsen Nagasaki 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:51.000
 Free gauge for is to use a line of standard trajectories that new Tosu Takeo Onsen museum uses a line of conventional lines 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:57.860
 The key to developing a train is essential 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:02.810
 A typical snowy road vehicle can only travel a track of a certain width 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:11.480
 Line width of Shinkansen is about 43.5 cm 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:18.560
 jr The conventional line is 1006.7 cm, and each needs a dedicated vehicle 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:19.830
 The free beige train can run both by using a conversion system. 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.060
 it can 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:30.710
 A combination of conventional line and Shinkansen 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:41.130
 We aim at introduction to Kyushu Shinkansen Nagasaki route Nagasaki Shinkansen 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:48.940
 With the Shinkansen running between Kumamoto and Kagoshima Chuo , traveling at a maximum speed of 270 km / h also appears 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:52.520
 jr Kyushu also embarked on development of a vehicle actually used in parallel with the driving test 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:55.069
 We are promoting maintenance for the opening of business 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:03:01.290
 is what they said 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:06.349
 The time has come, so let's all meet again 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.349
 It was time for a little bit of knowing tv 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.590
 ran
