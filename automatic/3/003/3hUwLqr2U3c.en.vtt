temporary I think it's a great platform
someone<00:02:58.530> asked<00:02:58.739> me<00:02:58.800> is<00:02:59.340> it<00:02:59.640> just<00:02:59.880> token<00:03:00.269> well

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
someone asked me is it just token well

someone asked me is it just token well
to<00:03:00.930> that<00:03:01.050> I<00:03:01.110> would<00:03:01.350> say<00:03:01.530> it's<00:03:01.739> no<00:03:02.130> more<00:03:02.280> token

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
to that I would say it's no more token

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.250 
to that I would say it's no more token
than<00:03:02.790> a<00:03:02.820> single<00:03:03.239> match<00:03:03.450> that<00:03:03.750> lights<00:03:03.930> a<00:03:04.050> fire

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260

and<00:03:04.620> that's<00:03:04.920> what<00:03:05.040> we<00:03:05.130> really<00:03:05.370> hope<00:03:05.790> is<00:03:06.030> that<00:03:06.300> a

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
and that's what we really hope is that a

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.320 
and that's what we really hope is that a
stage<00:03:07.590> a<00:03:07.980> platform<00:03:08.489> on<00:03:08.640> which<00:03:08.700> to<00:03:09.000> have<00:03:09.120> a
