00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
the news on the Today Show but I

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.440 
the news on the Today Show but I
practiced<00:02:16.130> I<00:02:16.460> worked<00:02:16.700> with<00:02:16.850> the<00:02:17.000> teleprompter

and<00:02:18.080> I'm<00:02:18.740> pretty<00:02:19.040> sure<00:02:19.340> I<00:02:19.670> was<00:02:20.000> fairly<00:02:20.990> awful

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
and I'm pretty sure I was fairly awful

and I'm pretty sure I was fairly awful
at<00:02:21.620> it<00:02:21.650> I<00:02:22.040> think<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.460> thing<00:02:22.670> that<00:02:22.850> saved<00:02:23.120> me<00:02:23.390> is

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
at it I think the thing that saved me is

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.530 
at it I think the thing that saved me is
that<00:02:23.900> I<00:02:24.260> would<00:02:24.770> have<00:02:24.920> sort<00:02:25.430> of<00:02:25.550> semi<00:02:26.210> pithy

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
that I would have sort of semi pithy

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.480 
that I would have sort of semi pithy
things<00:02:26.960> to<00:02:27.170> say<00:02:27.350> at<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:27.620> end<00:02:27.650> of<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:27.980> newscast

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
I remember there was a story about a

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.940 
I remember there was a story about a
skier<00:02:31.610> who<00:02:31.880> was<00:02:32.060> lost<00:02:32.300> and<00:02:32.810> in<00:02:32.930> order<00:02:33.230> to<00:02:33.260> be

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
skier who was lost and in order to be

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.690 
skier who was lost and in order to be
discovered<00:02:34.550> by<00:02:34.820> the<00:02:35.680> rescue<00:02:36.680> planes<00:02:37.340> or

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
discovered by the rescue planes or

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.640 
discovered by the rescue planes or
whatever<00:02:37.970> that<00:02:38.210> were<00:02:38.360> circling<00:02:38.840> overhead<00:02:39.170> he

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
whatever that were circling overhead he

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.350 
whatever that were circling overhead he
he<00:02:40.430> let<00:02:40.700> his<00:02:41.000> his<00:02:41.930> cash<00:02:42.350> on<00:02:42.680> fire<00:02:43.040> and<00:02:43.700> was<00:02:44.000> able

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
he let his his cash on fire and was able

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.030 
he let his his cash on fire and was able
to<00:02:44.390> draw<00:02:44.750> attention<00:02:44.870> to<00:02:45.260> himself<00:02:45.560> and<00:02:45.950> I<00:02:46.010> think

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
to draw attention to himself and I think

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.010 
to draw attention to himself and I think
I<00:02:46.310> flew<00:02:46.580> back<00:02:46.760> to<00:02:46.790> Bryant<00:02:47.270> Gumble<00:02:47.600> and<00:02:47.750> said<00:02:47.990> I

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
I flew back to Bryant Gumble and said I

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.100 
I flew back to Bryant Gumble and said I
think<00:02:48.170> in<00:02:48.440> my<00:02:48.590> in<00:02:49.130> my<00:02:49.580> case<00:02:50.210> I<00:02:50.420> probably<00:02:50.750> only

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
think in my in my case I probably only

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.860 
think in my in my case I probably only
have<00:02:51.470> changed<00:02:52.040> and<00:02:52.340> I<00:02:53.120> know<00:02:53.270> it<00:02:53.480> doesn't<00:02:53.660> sound

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
have changed and I know it doesn't sound

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.210 
have changed and I know it doesn't sound
that<00:02:53.960> funny<00:02:54.260> and<00:02:54.440> it<00:02:54.560> probably<00:02:54.920> wasn't<00:02:55.070> that

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
that funny and it probably wasn't that

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.280 
that funny and it probably wasn't that
funny<00:02:55.520> but<00:02:55.760> it<00:02:55.820> was<00:02:55.850> sort<00:02:56.120> of<00:02:56.180> funny<00:02:56.420> this<00:02:57.020> is

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
funny but it was sort of funny this is

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.150 
funny but it was sort of funny this is
today<00:02:57.710> with<00:02:58.700> Bryant<00:02:59.180> Gumbel<00:02:59.770> Kathryn<00:03:00.770> Couric

today with Bryant Gumbel Kathryn Couric

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.300 
today with Bryant Gumbel Kathryn Couric
and<00:03:01.370> Joe<00:03:02.090> Garagiola<00:03:02.450> I<00:03:03.380> think<00:03:03.980> I<00:03:04.070> felt

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
and Joe Garagiola I think I felt

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.370 
and Joe Garagiola I think I felt
comfortable<00:03:04.700> in<00:03:04.850> my<00:03:05.000> own<00:03:05.030> skin<00:03:05.210> and<00:03:05.900> I<00:03:06.110> had

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
comfortable in my own skin and I had

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.510 
comfortable in my own skin and I had
sort<00:03:06.950> of<00:03:07.070> an<00:03:08.060> easygoing<00:03:08.750> way<00:03:09.050> about<00:03:09.320> me<00:03:09.590> and<00:03:09.860> so

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
sort of an easygoing way about me and so

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.540 
sort of an easygoing way about me and so
as<00:03:10.730> a<00:03:10.760> result<00:03:11.300> I<00:03:11.510> think<00:03:11.540> when<00:03:12.550> Deborah

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
as a result I think when Deborah

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.250 
as a result I think when Deborah
Norville<00:03:13.700> went<00:03:14.090> on<00:03:14.180> maternity<00:03:14.300> leave<00:03:14.960> and

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
Norville went on maternity leave and

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.530 
Norville went on maternity leave and
they<00:03:15.380> needed<00:03:15.590> someone<00:03:15.920> to<00:03:16.160> fill<00:03:16.400> in<00:03:16.430> they<00:03:17.030> saw

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
they needed someone to fill in they saw

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.130 
they needed someone to fill in they saw
me<00:03:17.900> as<00:03:18.170> somebody<00:03:18.620> they<00:03:19.280> wanted<00:03:19.670> to<00:03:20.030> to<00:03:20.600> try<00:03:20.870> out

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
me as somebody they wanted to to try out

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.449 
me as somebody they wanted to to try out
and<00:03:21.470> as<00:03:21.740> a<00:03:21.770> result<00:03:22.220> I<00:03:22.459> was<00:03:22.580> I<00:03:22.820> was<00:03:23.090> lucky<00:03:23.510> and

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
and as a result I was I was lucky and

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.730 
and as a result I was I was lucky and
timing<00:03:25.459> is<00:03:25.610> everything<00:03:25.760> and<00:03:26.420> I<00:03:27.290> ended<00:03:27.620> up

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 
timing is everything and I ended up

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.710 
timing is everything and I ended up
being<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.160> full-time<00:03:28.580> anchor<00:03:29.000> and<00:03:29.209> I<00:03:29.330> stayed

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
being the full-time anchor and I stayed

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.650 
being the full-time anchor and I stayed
there<00:03:29.750> for<00:03:29.900> 15<00:03:30.440> years<00:03:30.680> I<00:03:31.330> whether<00:03:32.330> it<00:03:32.510> was
