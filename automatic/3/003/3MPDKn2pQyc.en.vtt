so at page 96 for its special defense
it's<00:02:56.720> not<00:02:56.930> that<00:02:57.590> great<00:02:57.620> but<00:02:58.310> its<00:02:58.819> wake<00:02:59.239> a

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
better than a base 70 so you could

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.170

so what I wanted to do is also give it a

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.530 
so what I wanted to do is also give it a
good<00:03:33.290> increase<00:03:34.010> to<00:03:34.040> its<00:03:34.310> speed<00:03:34.640> knowing<00:03:35.390> that

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
good increase to its speed knowing that

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.190 
good increase to its speed knowing that
if<00:03:35.660> it<00:03:35.780> had<00:03:35.900> a<00:03:35.930> choice<00:03:36.230> start<00:03:36.590> on<00:03:36.970> um<00:03:37.970> it<00:03:38.690> will

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
if it had a choice start on um it will

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.530 
if it had a choice start on um it will
be<00:03:39.290> fast<00:03:39.560> or<00:03:39.709> days<00:03:40.010> 115<00:03:40.610> is<00:03:40.730> very<00:03:41.000> very<00:03:41.269> fast

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
be fast or days 115 is very very fast

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.800 
be fast or days 115 is very very fast
and<00:03:41.840> I<00:03:42.230> should<00:03:42.440> know<00:03:42.470> because<00:03:43.329> what<00:03:44.329> I<00:03:44.360> gave<00:03:44.660> it

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
and I should know because what I gave it

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.800 
and I should know because what I gave it
a<00:03:44.930> base<00:03:45.110> 115<00:03:45.920> ambipom<00:03:46.910> has<00:03:47.269> the<00:03:47.360> same<00:03:47.570> base

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
a base 115 ambipom has the same base

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.900 
a base 115 ambipom has the same base
stat<00:03:48.110> for<00:03:48.380> its<00:03:48.500> database<00:03:48.950> 115<00:03:49.549> so<00:03:49.670> you<00:03:49.730> know

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
stat for its database 115 so you know

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.750 
stat for its database 115 so you know
how<00:03:50.120> fast<00:03:50.150> it's<00:03:50.630> going<00:03:50.660> to<00:03:50.840> be<00:03:50.989> so<00:03:51.680> I<00:03:51.709> base<00:03:52.100> 115

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
how fast it's going to be so I base 115

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.449 
how fast it's going to be so I base 115
for<00:03:52.910> its<00:03:53.030> feet<00:03:53.239> in<00:03:53.390> base<00:03:54.010> 1.24<00:03:55.010> it's<00:03:55.130> festival

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
for its feet in base 1.24 it's festival

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:56.620 
for its feet in base 1.24 it's festival
attack<00:03:55.730> this<00:03:55.850> thing<00:03:55.910> is<00:03:56.150> going<00:03:56.299> to<00:03:56.390> be<00:03:56.540> a<00:03:56.570> very

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
attack this thing is going to be a very

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.740 
attack this thing is going to be a very
very<00:03:57.170> fast<00:03:57.470> physical<00:03:57.829> attacker<00:03:58.340> so<00:03:59.120> there's

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
very fast physical attacker so there's

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.590 
very fast physical attacker so there's
it<00:03:59.989> staff<00:04:00.260> now<00:04:00.530> its<00:04:00.709> base<00:04:00.920> that<00:04:01.190> is<00:04:01.280> at<00:04:01.400> 519<00:04:02.299> and

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
it staff now its base that is at 519 and

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.060 
it staff now its base that is at 519 and
when<00:04:02.810> a<00:04:02.840> negative<00:04:03.320> ball<00:04:03.470> is<00:04:03.650> going<00:04:03.769> to<00:04:03.890> be<00:04:03.980> at

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
when a negative ball is going to be at

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.390 
when a negative ball is going to be at
619<00:04:04.970> it's<00:04:05.690> a<00:04:05.750> very<00:04:05.989> odd<00:04:06.260> number<00:04:06.650> actually<00:04:06.859> with

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
619 it's a very odd number actually with

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.789 
619 it's a very odd number actually with
just<00:04:08.079> face<00:04:09.250> 119<00:04:10.250> and<00:04:10.549> 619<00:04:11.560> they<00:04:12.560> could

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
just face 119 and 619 they could

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:14.800 
just face 119 and 619 they could
probably<00:04:13.130> rounded<00:04:13.640> it<00:04:13.730> out<00:04:13.850> today<00:04:14.030> probably<00:04:14.420> a

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
probably rounded it out today probably a

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.729 
probably rounded it out today probably a
522<00:04:15.799> 620<00:04:16.430> so<00:04:17.150> that's<00:04:17.870> just<00:04:18.140> my<00:04:18.260> opinion<00:04:18.289> on<00:04:18.709> a

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
522 620 so that's just my opinion on a

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.069 
522 620 so that's just my opinion on a
face<00:04:19.100> step<00:04:19.400> now<00:04:19.880> for<00:04:20.120> its<00:04:20.239> ability<00:04:20.419> I<00:04:20.690> decide

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
face step now for its ability I decide

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.260 
face step now for its ability I decide
to<00:04:21.109> get<00:04:21.350> the<00:04:21.470> same<00:04:21.680> tough<00:04:21.979> cause<00:04:22.280> now<00:04:22.880> I<00:04:22.910> was

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
to get the same tough cause now I was

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.090 
to get the same tough cause now I was
actually<00:04:23.570> going<00:04:24.169> to<00:04:24.350> be<00:04:24.440> given<00:04:24.710> this<00:04:24.740> thing

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
actually going to be given this thing

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.610 
actually going to be given this thing
whereas<00:04:25.370> a<00:04:25.400> strong<00:04:25.880> job<00:04:26.210> but<00:04:26.810> I<00:04:26.840> look<00:04:27.200> into<00:04:27.440> its

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
whereas a strong job but I look into its

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.890 
whereas a strong job but I look into its
move<00:04:27.830> and<00:04:28.070> the<00:04:28.250> only<00:04:28.400> jaw<00:04:28.850> moves<00:04:29.360> that<00:04:29.539> it<00:04:29.660> gets

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
move and the only jaw moves that it gets

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.070 
move and the only jaw moves that it gets
is<00:04:30.169> bite<00:04:30.919> crunch<00:04:31.520> aah<00:04:31.880> Thunder<00:04:32.690> thing<00:04:32.870> and

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
is bite crunch aah Thunder thing and

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.779 
is bite crunch aah Thunder thing and
fire<00:04:33.260> thing<00:04:33.500> now<00:04:33.950> I<00:04:33.979> wonder<00:04:34.310> gaming<00:04:34.700> this

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:34.789 
fire thing now I wonder gaming this

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:36.670 
fire thing now I wonder gaming this
thing<00:04:35.000> too<00:04:35.090> strong<00:04:35.419> dog<00:04:35.690> building<00:04:36.080> only<00:04:36.470> if

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
thing too strong dog building only if

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.800 
thing too strong dog building only if
this<00:04:37.250> thing<00:04:37.490> will<00:04:37.640> be<00:04:37.820> able<00:04:38.030> to<00:04:38.150> get<00:04:38.270> ice<00:04:38.479> fang

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
this thing will be able to get ice fang

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.200 
this thing will be able to get ice fang
but<00:04:39.349> it<00:04:39.500> doesn't<00:04:39.890> so<00:04:40.130> I<00:04:40.159> want<00:04:40.490> but<00:04:40.640> with<00:04:40.880> tough

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
but it doesn't so I want but with tough

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.230 
but it doesn't so I want but with tough
fog<00:04:41.479> knowing<00:04:41.900> that<00:04:42.020> the

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
fog knowing that the

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.570 
fog knowing that the
is<00:04:42.509> a<00:04:42.539> physical<00:04:43.080> attacker<00:04:43.319> and<00:04:43.650> it's<00:04:44.310> just

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
is a physical attacker and it's just

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.580 
is a physical attacker and it's just
like<00:04:44.669> Charizard<00:04:45.270> X<00:04:45.389> but<00:04:45.720> better<00:04:46.050> and<00:04:47.810> so<00:04:48.810> you

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
like Charizard X but better and so you

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.770 
like Charizard X but better and so you
will<00:04:49.800> be<00:04:49.830> able<00:04:49.979> to<00:04:50.280> play<00:04:50.430> I<00:04:50.669> can<00:04:51.479> remember<00:04:51.599> what

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
will be able to play I can remember what

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.870 
will be able to play I can remember what
tough<00:04:51.960> cause<00:04:52.199> does<00:04:52.440> I<00:04:52.680> know<00:04:53.039> it<00:04:53.400> gives<00:04:53.669> like

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
tough cause does I know it gives like

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.969 
tough cause does I know it gives like
thirty<00:04:54.180> three<00:04:54.419> percent<00:04:54.449> if<00:04:55.080> like<00:04:55.470> you<00:04:55.710> get

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
thirty three percent if like you get

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.070 
thirty three percent if like you get
contact<00:04:56.520> with<00:04:56.699> someone<00:04:56.910> so<00:04:57.569> that's<00:04:57.900> what<00:04:58.050> I

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
contact with someone so that's what I

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.469 
contact with someone so that's what I
believe<00:04:58.410> it<00:04:58.560> does<00:04:58.710> that<00:04:59.009> you<00:04:59.220> hit<00:04:59.490> if<00:04:59.729> you<00:05:00.000> are

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
believe it does that you hit if you are

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:02.390 
believe it does that you hit if you are
in<00:05:00.900> contact<00:05:01.380> like<00:05:01.560> for<00:05:01.860> instance<00:05:01.919> if<00:05:02.220> you<00:05:02.280> use

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
in contact like for instance if you use

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.830 
in contact like for instance if you use
like<00:05:02.550> Dragon<00:05:02.970> Claw<00:05:03.150> or<00:05:03.300> something<00:05:03.569> on<00:05:03.660> your

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
like Dragon Claw or something on your

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.420 
like Dragon Claw or something on your
opponent<00:05:04.199> and<00:05:04.319> you<00:05:04.590> get<00:05:04.740> that<00:05:04.889> thirty-three

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
opponent and you get that thirty-three

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:06.860 
opponent and you get that thirty-three
percent<00:05:05.580> boost<00:05:06.030> with<00:05:06.419> the<00:05:06.660> tough

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
percent boost with the tough

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.930 
percent boost with the tough
plausibility<00:05:07.410> so<00:05:08.039> that's<00:05:08.280> what<00:05:08.490> I<00:05:08.520> was<00:05:08.729> going

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
plausibility so that's what I was going

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.120 
plausibility so that's what I was going
for<00:05:09.060> that<00:05:09.240> plate<00:05:09.660> it<00:05:10.169> is<00:05:10.410> a<00:05:10.440> physical<00:05:10.680> attacker

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
for that plate it is a physical attacker

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.520 
for that plate it is a physical attacker
and<00:05:11.490> might<00:05:12.479> as<00:05:12.569> well<00:05:12.720> go<00:05:12.870> with<00:05:12.900> tough<00:05:13.259> claws

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
and might as well go with tough claws

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.680 
and might as well go with tough claws
considering<00:05:14.220> that<00:05:14.370> it<00:05:14.610> does<00:05:15.060> have<00:05:15.090> cause

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
considering that it does have cause

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.659 
considering that it does have cause
obviously<00:05:16.110> because<00:05:16.710> it<00:05:16.830> is<00:05:16.979> like<00:05:17.250> what<00:05:17.430> a

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:17.669 
obviously because it is like what a

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:21.980 
obviously because it is like what a
crocodile<00:05:18.919> hence<00:05:19.919> its<00:05:20.159> name<00:05:20.250> coconut<00:05:21.090> I<00:05:21.360> don't

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
crocodile hence its name coconut I don't

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.300 
crocodile hence its name coconut I don't
know<00:05:22.050> why<00:05:22.199> I<00:05:22.229> didn't<00:05:22.500> get<00:05:22.590> that<00:05:22.650> before<00:05:23.099> but

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
know why I didn't get that before but

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.850 
know why I didn't get that before but
that's<00:05:24.210> what<00:05:24.479> I<00:05:24.509> wanted<00:05:24.930> to<00:05:24.990> do<00:05:25.169> is<00:05:25.349> I<00:05:25.470> want<00:05:25.500> to

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
that's what I wanted to do is I want to

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.290 
that's what I wanted to do is I want to
either<00:05:25.979> get<00:05:26.220> this<00:05:26.400> thing<00:05:26.550> in<00:05:26.669> the<00:05:26.729> strong<00:05:27.030> jaw

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
either get this thing in the strong jaw

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.180 
either get this thing in the strong jaw
and<00:05:27.539> or<00:05:27.840> tough<00:05:28.080> clause<00:05:28.349> because<00:05:28.860> it<00:05:29.069> will

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
and or tough clause because it will

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.800 
and or tough clause because it will
either<00:05:29.340> give<00:05:29.610> a<00:05:29.639> boost<00:05:29.940> to<00:05:30.150> all<00:05:30.330> of<00:05:30.690> its

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
either give a boost to all of its

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.200 
either give a boost to all of its
physical<00:05:31.169> attacks<00:05:31.470> or<00:05:31.800> just<00:05:32.370> the<00:05:32.550> jaw<00:05:32.789> attacks

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
physical attacks or just the jaw attacks

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.420 
physical attacks or just the jaw attacks
like<00:05:33.509> thunder<00:05:34.409> fang<00:05:34.590> and<00:05:34.620> fire<00:05:34.919> think<00:05:35.220> so<00:05:35.400> I

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
like thunder fang and fire think so I

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.740 
like thunder fang and fire think so I
really<00:05:35.789> tough<00:05:36.150> phone<00:05:36.360> would<00:05:36.539> have<00:05:36.630> been<00:05:36.720> a

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
really tough phone would have been a

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.899 
really tough phone would have been a
better<00:05:36.900> ability<00:05:37.229> which<00:05:37.590> I<00:05:37.770> did<00:05:38.009> give<00:05:38.220> it<00:05:38.400> so<00:05:38.819> on

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:38.909 
better ability which I did give it so on

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:40.850 
better ability which I did give it so on
what<00:05:39.120> I<00:05:39.150> did<00:05:39.479> rather<00:05:39.810> than<00:05:39.990> a<00:05:40.050> strong<00:05:40.380> jaw<00:05:40.620> now

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
what I did rather than a strong jaw now

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.540 
what I did rather than a strong jaw now
if<00:05:41.039> what<00:05:41.250> had<00:05:41.490> all<00:05:41.990> was<00:05:42.990> the<00:05:43.139> 34<00:05:44.039> thing<00:05:44.280> moves

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
if what had all was the 34 thing moves

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.399 
if what had all was the 34 thing moves
then<00:05:45.120> i<00:05:45.330> would<00:05:45.509> definitely<00:05:45.810> gave<00:05:46.110> me<00:05:46.259> this

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:46.409 
then i would definitely gave me this

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:49.070 
then i would definitely gave me this
thing<00:05:46.650> strong<00:05:47.250> jaw<00:05:47.550> so<00:05:47.940> that's<00:05:48.690> why<00:05:48.900> i<00:05:48.930> gave

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
thing strong jaw so that's why i gave

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.779 
thing strong jaw so that's why i gave
this<00:05:49.349> any<00:05:49.560> tough<00:05:49.830> possibility<00:05:50.370> because<00:05:50.580> it<00:05:50.699> is

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:50.789 
this any tough possibility because it is

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:52.159 
this any tough possibility because it is
a<00:05:50.820> physical<00:05:51.030> attacker<00:05:51.479> and<00:05:51.690> you<00:05:51.810> do<00:05:52.020> get

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:52.169 
a physical attacker and you do get

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:54.080 
a physical attacker and you do get
thirty<00:05:52.530> three<00:05:52.710> percent<00:05:52.740> boost<00:05:53.340> to<00:05:53.940> its

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
thirty three percent boost to its

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:55.760 
thirty three percent boost to its
physical<00:05:54.449> attack<00:05:54.690> now<00:05:54.900> for<00:05:55.080> its<00:05:55.199> typing<00:05:55.650> I

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
physical attack now for its typing I

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.709 
physical attack now for its typing I
decided<00:05:56.370> just<00:05:56.460> to<00:05:56.639> leave<00:05:56.789> it<00:05:56.849> as<00:05:57.120> ground<00:05:57.389> dark

00:05:57.709 --> 00:05:57.719 
decided just to leave it as ground dark

00:05:57.719 --> 00:05:59.270 
decided just to leave it as ground dark
now<00:05:57.900> I<00:05:58.080> was<00:05:58.440> thinking<00:05:58.740> about<00:05:58.919> giving<00:05:59.070> this

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 
now I was thinking about giving this

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.830 
now I was thinking about giving this
into<00:05:59.580> steel<00:05:59.789> type<00:06:00.030> characteristics<00:06:00.419> and

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
into steel type characteristics and

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.020 
into steel type characteristics and
probably<00:06:01.169> just<00:06:01.440> dropping<00:06:02.370> the<00:06:02.460> ground<00:06:02.729> type

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030 
probably just dropping the ground type

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.749 
probably just dropping the ground type
and<00:06:03.300> making<00:06:03.690> this<00:06:03.780> think<00:06:04.020> dark<00:06:04.400> was<00:06:05.400> a<00:06:05.430> dark

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:05.759 
and making this think dark was a dark

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:08.870 
and making this think dark was a dark
scale<00:06:06.090> and<00:06:06.360> or<00:06:06.990> ground<00:06:07.770> seal<00:06:08.070> but<00:06:08.400> I<00:06:08.550> decided

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 
scale and or ground seal but I decided

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.939 
scale and or ground seal but I decided
leave<00:06:09.150> it<00:06:09.270> added<00:06:09.570> dark<00:06:10.139> brown<00:06:10.409> considering

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:10.949 
leave it added dark brown considering

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:12.529 
leave it added dark brown considering
that<00:06:11.069> we<00:06:11.219> don't<00:06:11.340> have<00:06:11.490> that<00:06:11.669> many<00:06:11.969> dark<00:06:12.300> type

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:12.539 
that we don't have that many dark type

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:14.600 
that we don't have that many dark type
of<00:06:12.719> mark<00:06:12.990> and<00:06:13.169> leave<00:06:13.680> you<00:06:13.800> krookodile<00:06:14.280> part

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.610 
of mark and leave you krookodile part

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.050 
of mark and leave you krookodile part
dark<00:06:15.030> would<00:06:15.599> be<00:06:15.750> better<00:06:15.990> and<00:06:16.319> it<00:06:16.680> is<00:06:16.919> a<00:06:17.190> ground

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 
dark would be better and it is a ground

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.260 
dark would be better and it is a ground
to<00:06:18.270> our<00:06:18.419> ace<00:06:19.289> i<00:06:19.650> would<00:06:19.800> say<00:06:19.949> sand<00:06:20.340> crocodile<00:06:20.940> so

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.270 
to our ace i would say sand crocodile so

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.180 
to our ace i would say sand crocodile so
leaving<00:06:22.259> the<00:06:22.409> ground<00:06:22.590> type<00:06:22.800> characteristics

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.190 
leaving the ground type characteristics

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.480 
leaving the ground type characteristics
is<00:06:24.289> perfect<00:06:25.289> for<00:06:25.469> it<00:06:25.590> so<00:06:25.740> dark<00:06:26.009> brown<00:06:26.250> is

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
is perfect for it so dark brown is

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.209 
is perfect for it so dark brown is
perfect<00:06:27.180> for<00:06:27.389> mega<00:06:28.199> hookah<00:06:28.530> though<00:06:28.560> so<00:06:28.949> with
