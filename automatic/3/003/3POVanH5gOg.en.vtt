and zoom in there so you guys a closer
look<00:00:49.890> at<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:51.210> course<00:00:51.390> it's<00:00:51.600> running

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
look at that so of course it's running

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.410 
look at that so of course it's running
Android<00:00:52.199> with<00:00:52.379> HTC<00:00:53.039> sense<00:00:53.070> that's<00:00:53.610> HTC<00:00:54.210> Sense

Android with HTC sense that's HTC Sense
version<00:00:54.899> 5<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.469> then<00:00:55.770> it's<00:00:55.920> running<00:00:56.010> Android

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
version 5 and then it's running Android

version 5 and then it's running Android
4.1<00:00:57.300> point2<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:58.500> that's<00:00:58.680> not<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.039> latest

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
4.1 point2 so that's not the latest

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.729 
4.1 point2 so that's not the latest
version<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.910> Android<00:01:00.300> but<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.079> in<00:01:01.260> fact<00:01:01.289> a

and<00:04:23.800> the<00:04:24.190> first<00:04:24.430> thing<00:04:24.550> I<00:04:24.730> noticed<00:04:25.090> is<00:04:25.180> just

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
and the first thing I noticed is just

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.660 
and the first thing I noticed is just
how<00:04:25.630> beautiful<00:04:26.440> the<00:04:26.560> smartphone<00:04:27.040> is<00:04:27.070> I<00:04:27.370> really

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
how beautiful the smartphone is I really

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.540 
how beautiful the smartphone is I really
think<00:04:27.970> the<00:04:28.360> build<00:04:28.570> quality<00:04:28.720> here<00:04:29.200> is

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
think the build quality here is

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.409 
think the build quality here is
outstanding<00:04:30.550> and<00:04:30.700> when<00:04:30.850> you<00:04:30.940> take<00:04:31.120> a<00:04:31.150> look<00:04:31.300> at

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
outstanding and when you take a look at

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:32.880 
outstanding and when you take a look at
all<00:04:31.540> those<00:04:31.660> other<00:04:31.900> Android<00:04:32.350> handsets<00:04:32.770> out

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
all those other Android handsets out

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:34.500 
all those other Android handsets out
there<00:04:33.070> that<00:04:33.220> are<00:04:33.250> made<00:04:33.430> of<00:04:33.550> plastic<00:04:34.030> I<00:04:34.180> think

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
there that are made of plastic I think

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.210 
there that are made of plastic I think
the<00:04:34.600> HTC<00:04:35.140> One<00:04:35.290> is<00:04:35.410> really<00:04:35.680> going<00:04:35.800> to<00:04:35.860> separate

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220

the HTC One is really going to separate
itself<00:04:36.490> in<00:04:36.700> terms<00:04:37.180> of<00:04:37.480> build<00:04:37.780> quality<00:04:37.900> it

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
itself in terms of build quality it

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.050 
itself in terms of build quality it
feels<00:04:38.800> like<00:04:39.010> something<00:04:39.430> you<00:04:39.730> know<00:04:39.820> that's<00:04:40.000> a

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060
