00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:11.920
 always that our windows 8 windows 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.840
 8.1 we will have realized that the 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.600
 computer or the operating system is not 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.750
 able to detect and much less 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.740
 connect to a network butt that's why 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.740
 I propose three solutions 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.699
 the first solution is with the application 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:32.059
 this one allows us to create a network 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:34.340
 of cat type that can be detected by 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:37.940
 any operating system by 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.850
 any device then yes 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:45.320
 we want a network of the kind of everything 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:47.180
 with this there will be no problems that 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.470
 our future windows 8 can not 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.430
 detect or any other system 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.160
 operative can not detect 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.120
 In addition to creating has many functions 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.739
 apart from application so if you 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.470
 like this solution can click 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.030
 to see more information of the 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.030
 application and be able to download it 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.790
 the second solution is also with a 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:13.370
 application is called bioware delay a 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.770
 subprogram of the previous one but to 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.500
 Unlike the previous one, it's not us 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.100
 allows you to create a network of the atos type 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.160
 scanned detect networks of the type 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.470
 high in our windows 8.1 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:30.860
 exclusively this type of network 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:35.420
 so that if we create our a network 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:38.180
 to your windows xp windows 7 easily 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:41.810
 we could detect with this our 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:45.490
 windows 8.1 and connect to this if you 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.490
 You can find this solution by clicking 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.670
 well the third and the last solution is 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.580
 for those who do not like to use 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.780
 applications and want to do it to 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:00.450
 through other methods then 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.360
 in this solution we will detect and 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.909
 connect to a butt network but with 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.810
 the windows commands will delay a 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.860
 little more 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:14.310
 the explanation but it is very simple 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.800
 practical and effective so if you like 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.850
 this solution and you do not want to use 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.209
 external applications I'm going to click on 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.209
 this 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.020
 once the application is installed 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:57.110
 we open as we will see and we will have 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.920
 detected a challenged call house for 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:03.290
 connect to this one we just have to click 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.780
 there in the network and dismiss the key to 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.170
 security this is the password 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.780
 what 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.930
 we have added our network we give 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.520
 the next but before here in the 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.840
 option that says connect when you start the 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.700
 app 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.920
 this will help us to connect 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.230
 automatically to this network when 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.030
 we open the application well if this one is 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.450
 accessible or is in the coverage of 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.450
 our wifi 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:35.050
 we activate it if we want we give it the 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:40.680
 next to connect 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.680
 let's wait until they connect to the network 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.680
 and it will have left us connected 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.750
 to see the details here the request 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:56.700
 connection was completed successfully 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.700
 now we do back 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.790
 and we'll see that she shows up in the 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:05.489
 network as connected 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.350
 to see more details of the connection 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:12.670
 we click on details 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:14.360
 and here the state appears below us 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.220
 connected 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.700
 to the network that we have connected to the 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:22.780
 home the type of network unleashed the 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:25.640
 encryption authentication connection mode 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:29.600
 channel the signal that is one hundred 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:31.370
 hundred the profile of the good network there 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.810
 is there is all the details of the 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.030
 Connection 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.820
 to disconnect now we just have to 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:41.040
 click on the same network and it will appear 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.600
 decides to disconnect from the network 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.830
 we accept you if we want 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.680
 disconnect 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.330
 and it does not stop it has been disconnected we take 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.160
 details and we want the request for 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.560
 disconnection completed successfully 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.410
 for the wifi interface 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:00.360
 well, it was back and we have to 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.360
 the network would appear as disconnected 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.020
 here we can connect if we want 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:09.800
 detect new available networks what 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.599
 we click on update 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.690
 we can also go to the menu 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:17.419
 options change the language of the 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.310
 application change the position of the 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.620
 application window on the side 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.470
 right the left side minimize 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:28.370
 window go out when we click on the 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:32.840
 closing button this will be minimized and in 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:36.440
 the taskbar instead of closing 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.820
 we can start with windows so that 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.030
 the application is executed when 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:44.000
 Let's start our operating system 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:46.970
 update networks automatically 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.650
 to not be clicking on the button 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:52.490
 update at every moment but that 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:54.350
 these are automatically detected every 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.660
 some time 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:59.129
 and we make some change in these options 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:01.489
 but let's see 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:01.489
 and ready 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:08.340
 good if you liked the app 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:13.670
 you can click on the button I like or 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:13.670
 maybe you can by donating to the application
