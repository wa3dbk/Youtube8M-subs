to<00:01:34.530> scare<00:01:34.799> him<00:01:34.950> off<00:01:35.180> because<00:01:36.180> this<00:01:36.360> jolteon

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
to scare him off because this jolteon

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.260 
to scare him off because this jolteon
does<00:01:36.900> packed<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.259> HP<00:01:37.590> ice<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:38.070> set<00:01:38.909> up<00:01:39.000> my<00:01:39.030> son

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
does packed the HP ice I set up my son

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.210 
does packed the HP ice I set up my son
predicting<00:01:39.689> him<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.930> switch<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:41.009> faculty

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
predicting him to switch and the faculty

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.550 
predicting him to switch and the faculty
sets<00:01:41.549> of<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.700> DD<00:01:42.000> tells<00:01:42.299> me<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.689> he<00:01:42.990> doesn't

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
sets of a DD tells me that he doesn't

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.069 
sets of a DD tells me that he doesn't
expect<00:01:44.189> an<00:01:44.369> HP<00:01:44.610> ice<00:01:44.729> whatsoever<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:45.930> I'm<00:01:45.990> just

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
expect an HP ice whatsoever so I'm just

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.240 
expect an HP ice whatsoever so I'm just
going<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.259> go<00:01:46.380> for<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.680> right<00:01:46.799> now<00:01:46.860> and

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
going to go for it right now and

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.359 
going to go for it right now and
hopefully<00:01:47.759> that'll<00:01:48.060> surprise<00:01:48.270> him<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:49.369> take

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
hopefully that'll surprise him and take

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.660 
hopefully that'll surprise him and take
it<00:01:50.490> out<00:01:50.579> so<00:01:51.030> that's<00:01:51.750> what<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:51.899> do<00:01:52.340> this<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.399> my

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
it out so that's what I do this is my

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.020 
it out so that's what I do this is my
life<00:01:53.970> orb<00:01:54.270> substitute<00:01:55.049> jolteon<00:01:56.030> you're

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
life orb substitute jolteon you're

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.480 
life orb substitute jolteon you're
supposed<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.140> pass<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.350> few<00:01:58.680> wishes<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.310> but

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
supposed to pass a few wishes to it but

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.179 
supposed to pass a few wishes to it but
he<00:01:59.670> sets<00:01:59.880> up<00:01:59.969> stealth<00:02:00.270> rock<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:01.189> can't

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
he sets up stealth rock and I can't

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.139 
he sets up stealth rock and I can't
guard<00:02:02.369> of<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.579> so<00:02:02.729> that's<00:02:02.850> pretty<00:02:03.090> much

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
guard of it so that's pretty much

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.969 
guard of it so that's pretty much
useless<00:02:03.420> so<00:02:04.229> this<00:02:04.320> jolteon<00:02:04.680> is<00:02:04.740> going<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:04.920> be

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
useless so this jolteon is going to be

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.889 
useless so this jolteon is going to be
like<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.130> one<00:02:05.369> time<00:02:05.640> used<00:02:05.880> maybe<00:02:06.180> two<00:02:06.509> if<00:02:06.780> i

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
like a one time used maybe two if i

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.440 
like a one time used maybe two if i
switch<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:07.229> out<00:02:07.350> right<00:02:07.649> now<00:02:07.849> but<00:02:08.849> i<00:02:09.119> don't

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
switch it out right now but i don't

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.510 
switch it out right now but i don't
exactly<00:02:09.660> want<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:09.989> do<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.319> anyway<00:02:11.129> he<00:02:11.340> brings

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
exactly want to do that anyway he brings

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.490 
exactly want to do that anyway he brings
in<00:02:11.640> his<00:02:11.760> ape<00:02:11.940> i<00:02:12.150> set<00:02:12.360> up<00:02:12.450> my<00:02:12.480> sub<00:02:12.750> again

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
in his ape i set up my sub again

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.730 
in his ape i set up my sub again
I<00:02:13.770> think<00:02:14.430> I'm<00:02:14.640> thinking<00:02:15.330> maybe<00:02:15.540> he'll<00:02:16.380> think

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
I think I'm thinking maybe he'll think

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.590 
I think I'm thinking maybe he'll think
that<00:02:16.920> I'm<00:02:17.010> trying<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.340> sub<00:02:17.520> down<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:17.880> a<00:02:17.910> pattaya

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
that I'm trying to sub down to a pattaya

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.870 
that I'm trying to sub down to a pattaya
or<00:02:18.780> something<00:02:19.110> but<00:02:19.350> that's<00:02:20.010> not<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.400> case<00:02:20.550> i

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
or something but that's not the case i

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.940 
or something but that's not the case i
do<00:02:21.300> hack<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.600> life<00:02:21.750> or<00:02:21.960> maybe<00:02:22.410> he<00:02:22.590> saw<00:02:22.740> that<00:02:22.890> I

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
do hack the life or maybe he saw that I

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.730 
do hack the life or maybe he saw that I
don't<00:02:23.190> know<00:02:23.510> he<00:02:24.510> hits<00:02:24.720> me<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:25.020> super<00:02:25.470> powerful

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
don't know he hits me the super powerful

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.620 
don't know he hits me the super powerful
flamethrower<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:26.640> this<00:02:26.940> jolteon<00:02:27.330> is<00:02:27.480> now

to get anything going with it I'm just

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.660 
to get anything going with it I'm just
going<00:02:31.380> to<00:02:31.440> hit<00:02:31.560> him<00:02:31.650> with<00:02:31.740> a<00:02:31.770> stab<00:02:32.040> tbell<00:02:32.430> it's

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
not going to kill him it would have

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.860 
not going to kill him it would have
actually<00:02:35.580> just<00:02:36.360> barely<00:02:36.720> but<00:02:37.340> I<00:02:38.480> guess<00:02:39.480> I<00:02:39.720> got

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
actually just barely but I guess I got

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.570 
actually just barely but I guess I got
some<00:02:40.020> luck<00:02:40.230> there<00:02:40.500> with<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.800> pair<00:02:40.980> hacks<00:02:41.250> but

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
some luck there with the pair hacks but

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.070 
some luck there with the pair hacks but
unfortunately<00:02:42.360> he<00:02:42.480> doesn't<00:02:42.570> say<00:02:42.870> fully

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
unfortunately he doesn't say fully

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.510 
unfortunately he doesn't say fully
paralyzed<00:02:43.470> so<00:02:43.620> I<00:02:43.680> can't<00:02:43.980> stay<00:02:44.220> in<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:44.459> do

paralyzed so I can't stay in and do

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.850 
paralyzed so I can't stay in and do
anything<00:02:44.850> about<00:02:44.940> it<00:02:45.060> so<00:02:45.989> he's<00:02:46.440> living<00:02:46.830> with

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
anything about it so he's living with

anything about it so he's living with
the<00:02:47.040> focus<00:02:47.370> ash<00:02:47.580> that<00:02:48.150> kind<00:02:48.330> of<00:02:48.360> sucks<00:02:48.660> but

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
the focus ash that kind of sucks but

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.080 
the focus ash that kind of sucks but
whatever<00:02:49.110> so<00:02:49.950> come<00:02:50.100> in<00:02:50.190> like<00:02:50.280> with<00:02:50.520> my<00:02:50.640> leafeon

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
and the whole time i was using it i

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.090 
and the whole time i was using it i
thought<00:02:53.640> like<00:02:54.150> I've<00:02:54.330> choice<00:02:54.660> band<00:02:54.959> this<00:02:55.920> is<00:02:56.070> a

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
thought like I've choice band this is a

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.680 
thought like I've choice band this is a
choice<00:02:56.310> man<00:02:56.520> it's<00:02:56.670> really<00:02:56.910> unique<00:02:57.239> it's

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
choice man it's really unique it's

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.240 
choice man it's really unique it's
unique<00:02:57.870> set<00:02:58.230> that<00:02:58.380> I<00:02:58.410> can't<00:02:58.680> kind<00:02:58.890> of<00:02:59.010> came<00:02:59.160> up

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
unique set that I can't kind of came up

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.070 
unique set that I can't kind of came up
with<00:02:59.430> it's<00:02:59.640> not<00:02:59.820> on<00:02:59.970> its<00:03:00.540> nowhere<00:03:00.900> that<00:03:01.020> I

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
with it's not on its nowhere that I

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.620 
with it's not on its nowhere that I
could<00:03:01.200> find<00:03:01.459> but<00:03:02.459> turns<00:03:03.090> out<00:03:03.180> it<00:03:03.300> doesn't<00:03:03.450> work

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
could find but turns out it doesn't work

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.780 
could find but turns out it doesn't work
that<00:03:03.690> well<00:03:04.430> considering<00:03:05.430> it<00:03:05.520> doesn't<00:03:05.700> have

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
that well considering it doesn't have

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.610 
that well considering it doesn't have
chlorophyll<00:03:07.280> so<00:03:08.280> anyway<00:03:08.640> he<00:03:09.060> has<00:03:09.270> a<00:03:09.630> store

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
chlorophyll so anyway he has a store

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.840 
chlorophyll so anyway he has a store
after<00:03:10.920> in<00:03:11.040> there<00:03:11.160> and<00:03:11.310> I'm<00:03:11.400> not<00:03:11.520> gonna<00:03:11.640> stay

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
recoil you know whatever so I sent my

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.759 
recoil you know whatever so I sent my
scarf<00:04:12.239> glaceon<00:04:12.840> which<00:04:13.110> I<00:04:13.230> probably<00:04:13.410> should

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
scarf glaceon which I probably should

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.470 
scarf glaceon which I probably should
have<00:04:13.829> I<00:04:14.010> promised<00:04:14.400> just<00:04:14.579> saved<00:04:14.790> my<00:04:14.940> vaporeon

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
have I promised just saved my vaporeon

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.800 
have I promised just saved my vaporeon
and<00:04:15.690> just<00:04:15.810> fodder<00:04:16.430> my-my<00:04:17.430> umbreon<00:04:17.910> but<00:04:18.180> the

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
and just fodder my-my umbreon but the

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.130 
and just fodder my-my umbreon but the
idea<00:04:19.530> at<00:04:19.859> this<00:04:19.979> point<00:04:20.070> was<00:04:20.479> I'd<00:04:21.479> be<00:04:21.720> able<00:04:21.900> to<00:04:21.989> go

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
idea at this point was I'd be able to go

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.070 
idea at this point was I'd be able to go
into<00:04:22.440> Umbreon<00:04:22.860> and<00:04:23.070> curse<00:04:23.310> up<00:04:23.550> but<00:04:24.450> that's<00:04:24.900> not

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
into Umbreon and curse up but that's not

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.379 
into Umbreon and curse up but that's not
going<00:04:25.229> to<00:04:25.349> be<00:04:25.530> the<00:04:25.800> case<00:04:25.950> as<00:04:26.010> you'll<00:04:26.370> see<00:04:26.550> here

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
going to be the case as you'll see here

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.830 
going to be the case as you'll see here
so<00:04:28.080> i<00:04:28.110> went<00:04:28.289> first<00:04:28.439> sunny<00:04:28.680> day<00:04:28.979> with<00:04:29.430> my

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
so i went first sunny day with my

so i went first sunny day with my
glaceon<00:04:30.840> i<00:04:30.870> couldn't<00:04:31.169> think<00:04:31.199> of<00:04:31.379> a<00:04:31.439> fourth

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
glaceon i couldn't think of a fourth

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:32.869 
glaceon i couldn't think of a fourth
move<00:04:31.860> so<00:04:31.979> I<00:04:32.009> was<00:04:32.129> like<00:04:32.189> I'll<00:04:32.310> just<00:04:32.460> put<00:04:32.699> sunny

00:04:32.869 --> 00:04:32.879 
move so I was like I'll just put sunny

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:35.600 
move so I was like I'll just put sunny
day<00:04:33.060> on<00:04:33.210> and<00:04:33.419> have<00:04:33.539> a<00:04:33.749> scarf<00:04:34.169> sunny<00:04:34.530> day<00:04:34.740> why

not<00:04:35.819> just<00:04:36.330> in<00:04:36.449> case<00:04:37.999> so<00:04:38.999> he's<00:04:39.180> just<00:04:39.210> going<00:04:39.479> to

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
not just in case so he's just going to

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.469 
not just in case so he's just going to

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:50.989 
because he can't do too much unless he's
packing<00:04:49.800> ice<00:04:49.949> beam<00:04:50.219> which<00:04:50.430> i'm<00:04:50.610> not<00:04:50.639> sure<00:04:50.909> if

00:04:50.989 --> 00:04:50.999 
packing ice beam which i'm not sure if

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:54.170 
packing ice beam which i'm not sure if
he<00:04:51.090> does<00:04:51.349> so<00:04:52.349> in<00:04:52.710> comes<00:04:52.860> a<00:04:53.009> Celebi<00:04:53.400> and<00:04:53.639> i<00:04:53.999> went

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
he does so in comes a Celebi and i went

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.730 
he does so in comes a Celebi and i went
for<00:04:54.300> the<00:04:54.360> obvious<00:04:54.569> obvious<00:04:54.990> leaf<00:04:55.349> blade<00:04:55.620> i

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
for the obvious obvious leaf blade i

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.350 
for the obvious obvious leaf blade i
probably<00:04:56.249> could<00:04:56.490> have<00:04:56.520> jumped<00:04:56.819> him<00:04:57.029> out<00:04:57.150> and

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
probably could have jumped him out and

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.839 
probably could have jumped him out and
just<00:04:57.749> went<00:04:57.900> into<00:04:58.020> Glaceon<00:04:58.529> and<00:04:58.860> I<00:04:59.340> think<00:04:59.580> but<00:04:59.819> I

00:04:59.839 --> 00:04:59.849 
just went into Glaceon and I think but I

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:01.640 
just went into Glaceon and I think but I
thought<00:05:00.120> he'd<00:05:00.330> stay<00:05:00.779> in<00:05:00.840> and<00:05:01.199> go<00:05:01.319> for<00:05:01.349> a<00:05:01.529> nice

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
thought he'd stay in and go for a nice

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.219 
thought he'd stay in and go for a nice
attack<00:05:02.009> but<00:05:02.789> whatever<00:05:03.479> didn't<00:05:03.930> work<00:05:04.020> out<00:05:04.139> that

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
attack but whatever didn't work out that

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:06.740 
attack but whatever didn't work out that
way<00:05:04.699> that<00:05:05.699> Celebi<00:05:06.270> isn't<00:05:06.479> going<00:05:06.599> to<00:05:06.659> be<00:05:06.719> too

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
way that Celebi isn't going to be too

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.360 
way that Celebi isn't going to be too
difficult<00:05:07.169> to<00:05:07.409> take<00:05:07.560> out<00:05:07.740> even<00:05:08.069> though<00:05:08.129> i<00:05:08.159> am

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
difficult to take out even though i am

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.219 
difficult to take out even though i am
left<00:05:08.610> with<00:05:08.789> like<00:05:09.300> my<00:05:09.479> last<00:05:09.629> two<00:05:09.840> guys<00:05:10.020> are

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
left with like my last two guys are

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:12.950 
left with like my last two guys are
choice<00:05:10.439> i<00:05:10.939> should<00:05:11.939> be<00:05:12.120> able<00:05:12.150> to<00:05:12.509> take<00:05:12.930> it

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
choice i should be able to take it

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.830 
choice i should be able to take it
pretty<00:05:13.229> easily<00:05:13.550> so<00:05:14.550> at<00:05:15.150> this<00:05:15.270> point<00:05:15.509> the

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
pretty easily so at this point the

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.019 
pretty easily so at this point the
sunlight<00:05:16.169> fades<00:05:16.379> and<00:05:16.650> I've<00:05:16.770> options<00:05:17.370> my

00:05:18.019 --> 00:05:18.029 
sunlight fades and I've options my

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:21.260 
sunlight fades and I've options my
options<00:05:18.240> are<00:05:18.569> ice<00:05:19.020> beam<00:05:19.349> or<00:05:19.620> sunny<00:05:19.889> day<00:05:20.099> and<00:05:20.370> my

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
options are ice beam or sunny day and my

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.829 
options are ice beam or sunny day and my
thought<00:05:21.479> process<00:05:21.900> was<00:05:21.930> still<00:05:22.349> that<00:05:22.589> uh

00:05:23.829 --> 00:05:23.839 
thought process was still that uh

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:27.640 
thought process was still that uh
leafeon<00:05:24.839> hads<00:05:25.400> chlorophyll<00:05:26.400> so

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
leafeon hads chlorophyll so

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.050 
leafeon hads chlorophyll so
unfortunately<00:05:28.650> his<00:05:29.129> grass<00:05:29.370> not<00:05:29.610> doesn't

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
unfortunately his grass not doesn't

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.279 
unfortunately his grass not doesn't
quite<00:05:30.180> take<00:05:30.360> me<00:05:30.509> out<00:05:30.599> so<00:05:30.749> at<00:05:30.870> this<00:05:30.960> point<00:05:31.169> I'm

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:31.289 
quite take me out so at this point I'm

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:32.510 
quite take me out so at this point I'm
like<00:05:31.349> damn<00:05:31.680> it<00:05:31.830> i<00:05:31.860> should<00:05:32.009> have<00:05:32.099> ice<00:05:32.219> beamed

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
like damn it i should have ice beamed

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.920 
like damn it i should have ice beamed
should<00:05:33.029> just<00:05:33.210> killed<00:05:33.419> it<00:05:33.539> and<00:05:34.879> that<00:05:35.879> sucks<00:05:36.360> so

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
should just killed it and that sucks so

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.350 
should just killed it and that sucks so
I<00:05:37.289> know<00:05:38.069> he<00:05:38.159> has<00:05:38.250> hidden<00:05:38.370> power<00:05:38.610> ice<00:05:38.819> now<00:05:39.180> at

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
I know he has hidden power ice now at

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.719 
I know he has hidden power ice now at
this<00:05:39.449> point<00:05:39.659> and<00:05:40.560> the<00:05:40.979> reason<00:05:41.129> I<00:05:41.339> wasn't<00:05:41.520> too

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:41.729 
this point and the reason I wasn't too

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:43.550 
this point and the reason I wasn't too
scared<00:05:42.000> of<00:05:42.029> Celebi<00:05:42.360> is<00:05:42.509> because<00:05:42.810> my<00:05:43.080> leafeon

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
scared of Celebi is because my leafeon

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.219 
scared of Celebi is because my leafeon
actually<00:05:43.889> packs<00:05:44.129> the<00:05:44.310> x-scissor<00:05:44.789> so<00:05:45.659> I<00:05:45.689> should

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229 
actually packs the x-scissor so I should

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:48.200 
actually packs the x-scissor so I should
be<00:05:46.259> able<00:05:46.379> to<00:05:46.649> take<00:05:47.069> it<00:05:47.189> out<00:05:47.310> with<00:05:47.520> one<00:05:48.000> hit

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
be able to take it out with one hit

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.760 
be able to take it out with one hit
because<00:05:48.750> I<00:05:48.839> am<00:05:48.990> choice<00:05:49.229> banded<00:05:49.500> and<00:05:51.770> I'm

will be able to take out his star me as

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:00.589 
will be able to take out his star me as
well<00:05:58.009> but<00:05:59.009> unfortunately<00:05:59.879> his<00:06:00.149> Celebi

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:00.599 
well but unfortunately his Celebi

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:02.179 
well but unfortunately his Celebi
decides<00:06:00.960> it<00:06:01.139> doesn't<00:06:01.319> want<00:06:01.439> to<00:06:01.500> die<00:06:01.649> yet<00:06:01.919> and

00:06:02.179 --> 00:06:02.189 
decides it doesn't want to die yet and

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:05.059 
decides it doesn't want to die yet and
it<00:06:02.399> survives<00:06:03.110> it<00:06:04.110> gets<00:06:04.289> the<00:06:04.409> in<00:06:04.500> power<00:06:04.680> ice<00:06:04.860> off

00:06:05.059 --> 00:06:05.069 
it survives it gets the in power ice off

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:06.379 
it survives it gets the in power ice off
and<00:06:05.279> I<00:06:05.310> do<00:06:05.370> survive<00:06:05.729> that<00:06:05.909> but<00:06:06.060> it<00:06:06.149> doesn't

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:06.389 
and I do survive that but it doesn't

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:09.499 
and I do survive that but it doesn't
matter<00:06:06.509> because<00:06:07.879> whatever<00:06:08.879> he<00:06:09.089> has<00:06:09.180> left<00:06:09.360> is

anyway<00:06:33.649> it<00:06:34.649> was<00:06:34.889> a<00:06:34.919> gamebattles<00:06:35.279> match<00:06:35.580> so<00:06:35.789> I

00:06:35.809 --> 00:06:35.819 
anyway it was a gamebattles match so I

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:37.279 
anyway it was a gamebattles match so I
can't<00:06:36.060> blame<00:06:36.300> him<00:06:36.479> for<00:06:36.539> being<00:06:36.750> high<00:06:37.050> tier

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:37.289 
can't blame him for being high tier

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:38.420 
can't blame him for being high tier
stuff<00:06:37.560> that's<00:06:37.709> what<00:06:37.830> you're<00:06:37.919> supposed<00:06:38.009> to<00:06:38.250> do

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:38.430 
stuff that's what you're supposed to do

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.159 
stuff that's what you're supposed to do
I<00:06:38.610> thought<00:06:39.120> I<00:06:39.149> could<00:06:39.330> win<00:06:39.360> with<00:06:39.479> this<00:06:39.690> team<00:06:39.930> and

I thought I could win with this team and

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:41.180 
I thought I could win with this team and
I<00:06:40.409> I<00:06:40.709> did

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:41.190 
I I did

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:42.890

get<00:06:41.310> several<00:06:41.700> wins<00:06:41.880> with<00:06:42.120> this<00:06:42.270> team<00:06:42.480> but<00:06:42.780> I

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:42.900 
get several wins with this team but I

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.750
