00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello to all and john and on 

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.930
 finds himself today for a new 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.690
 this is just the ps4 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.950
 which relatively silent can 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.599
 listen to it there and in fact we surrender 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.339
 account that if I play a little bit at 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.789
 multiplayer battlefield partly 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:20.689
 quick 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.249
 it goes very quickly in ventilation 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:26.369
 I certainly understood editing if it's 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:31.829
 too long but wanted to pose the camera 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:38.250
 right there and I would get it back once 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:39.839
 that the loading is done and that 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.370
 hear the ventilation gets going 

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:43.370
 relatively strong en route 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.329
 good 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.110
 dance well 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:15.759
 that's not five minutes of play and 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.759
 we already hear it 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.890
 I do not know if you hear a lot 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.130
 sorry for the shooting is 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.130
 enough 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.420
 he is there 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.420
 10 seconds input 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.030
 we are doing that already with 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:44.789
 battlefield 4 also with others 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:47.149
 two little psn games and that's right 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:51.920
 if you do not have a headset on your ears 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.920
 it is very very very noisy 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.939
 so my goal is going to be there loose is 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:13.000
 returned to the menu as could the 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:13.000
 see and the ps4 still counts as much 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.849
 so my goal is going to be just 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.349
 to disassemble the console is changed the 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.400
 thermal paste because I think that 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:26.569
 must be what was wrong went who 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:30.989
 sells heat cholet dissipation 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:34.769
 in bad condition so right now I 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:39.030
 the shades it slows down we'll get 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:41.310
 find for a next tutorial 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.159
 friends down we end up with the ps4 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.680
 that was dismantled frozen dusty t 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:50.220
 the entire ventirad was armored 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.319
 dust at this level there before the 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.370
 part the room is properly but to 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.739
 that level three quarters of the 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.230
 ventirad was completely clogged by 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.000
 a cumulation of dust and dough 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.439
 thermal was very poorly applied there 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.079
 had on the middle of the processor a 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:05.099
 hole and the four corners were not n 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:08.040
 was not covered with thermal paste 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:10.079
 so that's it's better pascal for the 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.549
 console especially the middle part the 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:14.989
 four corners it is not yet the most 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:17.989
 annoying so here I am going to apply 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:20.989
 correct layer of thermal paste 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.989
 here 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.750
 going on subway I put an equivalent 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:31.630
 a small point 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:34.209
 I put the equivalent of a pea and 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:44.739
 we will simply replace the map 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:48.370
 mother on the on the other side of the 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:52.390
 casing so simply tilted 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.349
 place correctly and that's your card 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.650
 mother is handed 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:59.500
 I will make a small dot on the 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.480
 silence obtained after a change of 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.540
 thermal and cleaning and I'll put that 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.739
 at the end of the video here and listen to me 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.239
 will do their editing quietly 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.519
 I would put a link in the video on 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.680
 how to disassemble his ps4 if ever 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:14.049
 the envied takes you must know that you 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.400
 lose the guarantee since I tried 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:17.680
 the hair dryer method for 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.940
 labels it's not perfect it's 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.950
 really not perfect we see there are some 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.229
 parts where there is where there is the part 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.860
 black who is here and well I you 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:27.880
 tell me just now 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.470
 and now here we well after 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.750
 launch of no permit have I can 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.940
 tell you it's day and night 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.479
 it's been a good ten minutes 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.850
 play abf 4 and I do not have a single sound 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:43.150
 ventilation 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:46.780
 we are very very quiet we do not hear 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.669
 not behind that warms it heats 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.680
 but there is no over-ventilation 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:51.310
 it's impeccable really I do not regret 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.810
 not my choice 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.180
 despite the fact that I lost the 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.370
 warranty I think that it will not 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.050
 long in the sense that the processor 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.370
 takes less in the head compared to 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:05.800
 the temperature that says they had to 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:08.740
 have it here I'm still dubbed not a 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.780
 Noise it's really I find my ps4 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.030
 from the beginning I find a ps what have you 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.770
 early I think that simply the 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.289
 people who have problems with 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:20.289
 relatively large breakdown on 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:23.050
 bf 4 killzone and all the games that are 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:23.919
 relatively heavy and that it does not 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.690
 does not come from the dvd 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:27.070
 I just think that there is a good 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.410
 part of the dust that had to 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:32.800
 accumulate on the ventirad and which 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:34.960
 blocks the evacuation of hot air and 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.880
 maybe also the thermal paste that has 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.370
 been poorly applied 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.990
 factory or who is simply from 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.840
 less good quality that has a less 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.640
 good conductivity of heat 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.120
 well listen I hope this video 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:50.520
 you liked another last shot 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:53.190
 do not hesitate to share if it could 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.450
 help if it makes you want to do 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.330
 even or perhaps to wait until the end of 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.560
 the guarantee for to do that and that's it 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.060
 I'll see you soon for a neighbor 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.200
 tutorial a gameplay video 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.200
 go go over everyone
