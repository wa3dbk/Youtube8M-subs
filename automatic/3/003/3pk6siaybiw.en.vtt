 identification of a risk 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.190
 for example a small part 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:51.920
 a pointed part a hole where the

 for children under 3 years of age 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:43.290
 age is to sell that is to respect this 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.420
 because because laboratory tests and 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:47.610
 the entire certification process 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:50.430

 this cord or a small hole where 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.940
 passing a child's finger can get 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:08.460
