series of short little videos on chord
substitutions<00:00:07.740> the<00:00:08.400> first<00:00:08.840> chord

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
substitutions the first chord

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.839 
substitutions the first chord
substitution<00:00:10.320> technique<00:00:10.469> we<00:00:10.830> took<00:00:11.070> up<00:00:11.280> was<00:00:11.550> to

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
substitution technique we took up was to

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.709 
substitution technique we took up was to
ask<00:00:12.030> ourselves<00:00:12.330> into<00:00:12.809> what<00:00:12.990> other<00:00:13.200> chord<00:00:14.719> what

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
ask ourselves into what other chord what

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.359 
ask ourselves into what other chord what
are<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.900> chord<00:00:16.139> this<00:00:16.230> melody<00:00:16.619> note<00:00:16.800> fits<00:00:17.130> so

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
are the chord this melody note fits so

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.310 
are the chord this melody note fits so
if<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.850> melody<00:00:18.150> note<00:00:18.300> fit<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.750> see<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.140> might

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
if the melody note fit and see it might

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.250 
if the melody note fit and see it might
also<00:00:19.470> fit<00:00:19.890> in<00:00:20.039> II<00:00:20.160> might<00:00:20.400> or<00:00:21.300> might<00:00:21.539> fit<00:00:21.960> in<00:00:22.080> a

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
also fit in II might or might fit in a

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.540 
also fit in II might or might fit in a
flat<00:00:22.910> or<00:00:23.910> might<00:00:24.150> flip<00:00:24.480> fit<00:00:24.990> in<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.590> flat<00:00:25.859> major

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
flat or might flip fit in a flat major

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.480 
flat or might flip fit in a flat major
7th<00:00:27.180> or<00:00:27.359> might<00:00:27.539> fit<00:00:27.779> in<00:00:27.930> G<00:00:28.199> C<00:00:28.650> minor<00:00:28.920> so<00:00:29.220> there's

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
7th or might fit in G C minor so there's

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.550 
7th or might fit in G C minor so there's
lots<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:29.880> lots<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.119> chords<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.990> melody<00:00:31.380> note

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
lots and lots of chords the melody note

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.990 
lots and lots of chords the melody note
will<00:00:31.769> fit<00:00:32.009> in<00:00:32.160> so<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:32.399> just<00:00:32.640> ask<00:00:32.850> yourself

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
will fit in so you just ask yourself

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.299 
will fit in so you just ask yourself
into<00:00:33.450> water<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.840> chord<00:00:34.140> will<00:00:34.770> this<00:00:34.890> melody

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
into water the chord will this melody

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.639 
into water the chord will this melody
note<00:00:35.489> fit<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.570> then<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.840> second<00:00:37.200> video<00:00:37.320> was

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
note fit and then the second video was

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.060 
note fit and then the second video was
on<00:00:37.910> 7th<00:00:38.910> chords<00:00:39.270> for<00:00:39.450> any<00:00:39.629> seventh<00:00:40.110> chord<00:00:40.410> you

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
on 7th chords for any seventh chord you

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.770 
on 7th chords for any seventh chord you
can<00:00:41.100> substitute<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.820> chord<00:00:42.120> that's<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.450> fourth

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
can substitute a chord that's a fourth

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.010 
can substitute a chord that's a fourth
below<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.290> root<00:00:43.550> and<00:00:44.550> make<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.270> minor<00:00:45.480> 7th

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
below the root and make it a minor 7th

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.350 
below the root and make it a minor 7th
so<00:00:46.260> for<00:00:46.500> C<00:00:46.680> 7th<00:00:47.070> we<00:00:47.160> can<00:00:47.280> substitute<00:00:47.610> G<00:00:47.910> minor<00:00:48.149> 7

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
so for C 7th we can substitute G minor 7

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.930 
so for C 7th we can substitute G minor 7
go<00:00:51.360> back<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.719> C<00:00:51.930> 7th<00:00:52.350> resolve<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.920> C<00:00:53.070> seventh<00:00:53.430> ok

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
go back to C 7th resolve to C seventh ok

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.299 
go back to C 7th resolve to C seventh ok
for<00:00:54.360> G<00:00:54.539> 7th<00:00:54.960> for<00:00:55.110> example<00:00:55.530> fourth<00:00:55.920> no<00:00:56.100> below

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
for G 7th for example fourth no below

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.010 
for G 7th for example fourth no below
that<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:56.730> d<00:00:56.969> so<00:00:57.750> for<00:00:58.250> for<00:00:59.250> G<00:00:59.640> 737<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.510> D<00:01:00.750> minor

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
that is d so for for G 737 to D minor

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.950 
that is d so for for G 737 to D minor
7th<00:01:04.129> ok

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
7th ok

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.160 
7th ok
so<00:01:06.960> for<00:01:07.260> any<00:01:07.439> 7th<00:01:08.159> chord<00:01:08.689> no<00:01:09.689> matter<00:01:09.869> what<00:01:10.080> it

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
so for any 7th chord no matter what it

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.530 
so for any 7th chord no matter what it
is<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.439> can<00:01:10.560> go<00:01:10.619> down<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.830> 4th<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.939> substitute

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
is you can go down a 4th and substitute

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.929 
is you can go down a 4th and substitute
a<00:01:12.750> minor<00:01:13.290> 7th<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:13.890> then<00:01:13.979> resolve<00:01:14.430> back<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.820> the

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
a minor 7th and then resolve back to the

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.730 
a minor 7th and then resolve back to the
court<00:01:15.270> by<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:15.990> way<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.170> don't<00:01:16.380> have<00:01:16.439> to

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
court by the way you don't have to

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.310 
court by the way you don't have to
resolve<00:01:17.040> back<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.700> chord<00:01:18.000> but<00:01:18.320> usually

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
resolve back to the chord but usually

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.800 
resolve back to the chord but usually
that<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.950> ok<00:01:20.520> so<00:01:20.790> so<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.330> have<00:01:21.450> this<00:01:21.570> kind<00:01:21.780> of

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
that is ok so so you have this kind of

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.710 
that is ok so so you have this kind of
feeling

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.980 

see<00:01:28.720> that<00:01:28.950> okay<00:01:29.950> and<00:01:30.100> the<00:01:30.220> third<00:01:30.430> quart

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
see that okay and the third quart

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.880 
see that okay and the third quart
substitution<00:01:31.990> technique<00:01:32.140> I'd<00:01:32.470> like<00:01:32.620> to<00:01:32.710> talk

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
substitution technique I'd like to talk

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.100 
substitution technique I'd like to talk
about<00:01:32.950> are<00:01:33.460> called<00:01:33.790> half-step<00:01:34.390> slides

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
about are called half-step slides

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.990 
about are called half-step slides
anytime<00:01:35.740> you're<00:01:35.920> moving<00:01:36.220> from<00:01:36.340> one<00:01:36.610> chord<00:01:36.940> to

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
anytime you're moving from one chord to

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.840 
anytime you're moving from one chord to
another<00:01:37.560> look<00:01:38.560> for<00:01:38.860> opportunities<00:01:39.520> to<00:01:39.550> do

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
another look for opportunities to do

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.640 
another look for opportunities to do
half<00:01:40.090> step<00:01:40.390> slides<00:01:40.750> what<00:01:41.020> I<00:01:41.050> mean<00:01:41.320> by<00:01:41.470> that

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
half step slides what I mean by that

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.620 
half step slides what I mean by that
well<00:01:41.890> let's<00:01:42.340> say<00:01:42.460> we're<00:01:42.610> going<00:01:42.760> from<00:01:42.910> a<00:01:43.060> C<00:01:43.300> to<00:01:43.479> F

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
well let's say we're going from a C to F

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.870 
well let's say we're going from a C to F
the<00:01:44.470> C<00:01:44.680> chord<00:01:45.070> to<00:01:45.820> the<00:01:45.850> F<00:01:46.119> chord<00:01:46.450> okay<00:01:47.880> well

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
the C chord to the F chord okay well

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.230 
the C chord to the F chord okay well
what's<00:01:49.360> a<00:01:49.450> half<00:01:49.630> step<00:01:49.869> above<00:01:50.020> F<00:01:50.700> it's<00:01:51.700> F<00:01:51.940> sharp

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
what's a half step above F it's F sharp

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.930 
what's a half step above F it's F sharp
so<00:01:53.170> I<00:01:53.200> should<00:01:53.440> look<00:01:53.560> for<00:01:53.619> the<00:01:53.860> opportunity<00:01:54.550> to

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
so I should look for the opportunity to

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.420 
so I should look for the opportunity to
play<00:01:55.240> an<00:01:55.630> F<00:01:55.810> sharp<00:01:55.840> chord<00:01:56.410> right<00:01:56.710> before<00:01:57.160> I

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
play an F sharp chord right before I

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.700 
play an F sharp chord right before I
play<00:01:58.030> an<00:01:58.149> F<00:01:58.300> chord<00:01:58.330> or<00:01:58.720> what's<00:01:59.259> a<00:01:59.350> half<00:01:59.500> step

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
play an F chord or what's a half step

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.210 
play an F chord or what's a half step
below<00:01:59.830> F<00:02:00.130> II<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:02.110> play<00:02:02.350> an<00:02:02.500> E<00:02:02.710> chord<00:02:02.740> right

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
below F II to play an E chord right

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.590 
below F II to play an E chord right
before<00:02:03.580> I<00:02:03.610> go<00:02:03.729> to<00:02:03.759> it<00:02:03.910> and<00:02:04.149> usually<00:02:04.270> you<00:02:04.540> can

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
before I go to it and usually you can

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.990 
before I go to it and usually you can
use<00:02:04.840> the<00:02:04.990> seventh<00:02:05.440> if<00:02:06.160> you<00:02:06.310> use<00:02:06.430> the<00:02:06.610> seventh

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
use the seventh if you use the seventh

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.880 
use the seventh if you use the seventh
that<00:02:07.119> makes<00:02:07.390> this<00:02:07.540> smoother<00:02:08.290> for<00:02:08.500> example

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
that makes this smoother for example

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:15.360 
that makes this smoother for example
let's<00:02:09.100> say<00:02:09.220> I'm<00:02:09.340> on<00:02:09.459> C<00:02:13.200> there's<00:02:14.200> there's<00:02:14.680> G

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
let's say I'm on C there's there's G

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.900 
let's say I'm on C there's there's G
flat<00:02:15.670> seventh<00:02:16.380> that's<00:02:17.380> a<00:02:17.560> half<00:02:17.739> step<00:02:17.770> above<00:02:18.250> F

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
flat seventh that's a half step above F

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.370 
flat seventh that's a half step above F
C<00:02:19.209> and<00:02:19.540> I<00:02:19.630> just<00:02:19.870> slide<00:02:20.170> it<00:02:20.350> again<00:02:22.200> let's<00:02:23.200> say

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
C and I just slide it again let's say

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.660 
C and I just slide it again let's say
almost<00:02:23.820> on<00:02:24.820> G<00:02:25.180> so<00:02:25.390> I'm<00:02:26.380> going<00:02:26.739> to<00:02:26.800> see<00:02:27.100> what's<00:02:27.580> a

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
almost on G so I'm going to see what's a

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.740 
almost on G so I'm going to see what's a
half<00:02:27.820> step<00:02:28.060> above<00:02:28.180> C<00:02:28.980> it's<00:02:29.980> D<00:02:30.220> flat<00:02:30.519> E<00:02:30.549> flat<00:02:30.750> D

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
half step above C it's D flat E flat D

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:38.190 
half step above C it's D flat E flat D
flat<00:02:31.900> seventh<00:02:32.560> chord<00:02:32.830> watch<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:37.810> again<00:02:38.080> if

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
flat seventh chord watch and again if

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.080 
flat seventh chord watch and again if
you<00:02:38.290> use<00:02:38.320> the<00:02:38.680> seventh<00:02:39.100> or<00:02:39.280> a<00:02:39.310> night<00:02:39.519> that<00:02:39.790> it's

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
you use the seventh or a night that it's

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.630 
you use the seventh or a night that it's
smoother<00:02:40.450> but<00:02:40.750> even<00:02:41.200> if<00:02:41.290> you<00:02:41.410> don't<00:02:41.680> it's

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
smoother but even if you don't it's

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.670 
smoother but even if you don't it's
still<00:02:43.000> a<00:02:43.030> good<00:02:43.299> person

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.890 

okay<00:02:47.790> let's<00:02:48.790> do<00:02:48.910> one<00:02:48.940> more<00:02:49.270> then<00:02:49.450> we'll<00:02:49.630> call

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
okay let's do one more then we'll call

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.500 
okay let's do one more then we'll call
it<00:02:50.050> if<00:02:50.530> you<00:02:50.800> have<00:02:51.010> a<00:02:51.040> let's<00:02:51.970> say<00:02:52.120> that<00:02:52.270> we're

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
it if you have a let's say that we're

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.760 
it if you have a let's say that we're
going<00:02:52.720> from<00:02:53.110> a<00:02:53.500> F<00:02:54.070> chord<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:55.480> a<00:02:55.510> B<00:02:55.900> flat<00:02:56.230> chord

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
going from a F chord to a B flat chord

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.210 
going from a F chord to a B flat chord
what's<00:02:56.920> a<00:02:57.190> half-step<00:02:57.610> below<00:02:57.990> B<00:02:58.990> B<00:02:59.650> flat

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
what's a half-step below B B flat

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.580 
what's a half-step below B B flat
it's<00:03:00.850> a<00:03:01.030> isn't<00:03:01.240> it<00:03:01.570> so<00:03:01.930> you'd<00:03:02.140> play<00:03:02.320> eight

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
it's a isn't it so you'd play eight

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.970 
it's a isn't it so you'd play eight
seven<00:03:03.040> then<00:03:03.220> slide<00:03:03.520> up<00:03:03.550> to<00:03:03.880> be<00:03:04.210> flood<00:03:04.800> or<00:03:05.800> we

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
seven then slide up to be flood or we

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.910 
seven then slide up to be flood or we
could<00:03:06.100> play<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.460> B<00:03:06.640> chord<00:03:07.140> and<00:03:08.140> slide<00:03:08.530> down<00:03:08.560> to

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
could play the B chord and slide down to

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.430 
could play the B chord and slide down to
be<00:03:09.070> flood<00:03:09.370> let<00:03:09.970> me<00:03:10.090> do<00:03:10.210> that<00:03:10.330> in<00:03:10.390> context
