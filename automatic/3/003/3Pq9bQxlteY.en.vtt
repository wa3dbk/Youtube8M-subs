00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
reach us the Orion Nebula however is so

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.420 
reach us the Orion Nebula however is so

its<00:03:44.790> size<00:03:45.090> in<00:03:45.450> lightyears<00:03:45.810> and<00:03:46.500> it<00:03:47.100> is<00:03:47.250> a

its size in lightyears and it is a

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.690 
its size in lightyears and it is a

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.280 
mind-blowing 30 light-years in diameter
which<00:03:50.700> means<00:03:50.730> that<00:03:51.060> it<00:03:51.180> takes<00:03:51.450> 30<00:03:51.690> years<00:03:52.080> for

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
which means that it takes 30 years for
