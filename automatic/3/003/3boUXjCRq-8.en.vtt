I just want to talk about light

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.330 
I just want to talk about light
intensity<00:00:51.930> basically<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.860> here's<00:00:53.010> how<00:00:53.160> it

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
intensity basically and here's how it

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.080 
intensity basically and here's how it
goes<00:00:53.520> so<00:00:54.239> in<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:54.690> tank<00:00:54.930> right<00:00:55.140> here<00:00:55.199> I've<00:00:55.590> got

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.380 
goes so in this tank right here I've got
150<00:00:57.090> watts<00:00:57.890> 150<00:00:58.890> watts<00:00:59.100> and<00:01:00.000> then<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.210> one<00:01:00.300> of

150 watts 150 watts and then the one of
the<00:01:00.449> Middle's<00:01:00.719> not<00:01:00.930> on<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.530> you're<00:01:02.399> looking<00:01:02.550> at

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
the Middle's not on so you're looking at

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.870 
the Middle's not on so you're looking at
300<00:01:03.719> Watts<00:01:04.710> over<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:06.320> only<00:01:07.320> 200<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.369> gallon

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
300 Watts over a only 200 and gallon

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.429 
300 Watts over a only 200 and gallon
tank<00:01:09.150> okay<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:09.540> it's<00:01:09.750> not<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:10.260> great

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
tank okay so it's not that great

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.320 
tank okay so it's not that great
intensity<00:01:10.860> I'll<00:01:11.189> be<00:01:11.340> at<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.490> halides<00:01:11.909> put<00:01:12.180> out

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
intensity I'll be at the halides put out

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.179 
intensity I'll be at the halides put out
a<00:01:12.600> little<00:01:13.110> more<00:01:13.320> bang<00:01:13.500> for<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.799> buck<00:01:13.830> than

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
a little more bang for the buck than

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.030 
a little more bang for the buck than
fluorescence<00:01:14.729> but<00:01:14.970> if<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:16.080> had<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.380> all<00:01:16.770> three

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
fluorescence but if I had that all three

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.359 
fluorescence but if I had that all three
of<00:01:17.100> them<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.340> be<00:01:17.400> 450<00:01:17.810> now<00:01:18.810> this<00:01:19.470> tank<00:01:19.799> has<00:01:20.130> been

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
of them to be 450 now this tank has been

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.899 
of them to be 450 now this tank has been
run<00:01:20.640> with<00:01:20.790> as<00:01:20.909> little<00:01:21.180> as<00:01:21.270> 120<00:01:22.200> watts<00:01:22.670> okay<00:01:23.670> and

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
run with as little as 120 watts okay and

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.370 
run with as little as 120 watts okay and
I<00:01:23.970> bring<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.330> up<00:01:24.479> because<00:01:24.659> Justin<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.350> I

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
I bring this up because Justin and I

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.920 
I bring this up because Justin and I
were<00:01:25.500> talking<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:25.979> he<00:01:26.009> was<00:01:26.159> asking<00:01:26.430> me<00:01:26.640> about

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
were talking and he was asking me about

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.230 
were talking and he was asking me about
my<00:01:27.930> 90<00:01:28.259> gallon<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:29.189> he<00:01:29.340> goes<00:01:29.520> how<00:01:29.790> many<00:01:29.970> watts

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
my 90 gallon and he goes how many watts

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.510 
my 90 gallon and he goes how many watts
you<00:01:30.450> run<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.689> on<00:01:30.780> your<00:01:30.810> 90<00:01:31.170> gallon<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:32.280> told

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
you run it on your 90 gallon and I told

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.550 
you run it on your 90 gallon and I told
him<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:33.240> truth<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.659> said<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:33.869> got<00:01:34.079> thirty<00:01:34.350> two

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
him the truth I said I got thirty two

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.270 
him the truth I said I got thirty two
times<00:01:34.860> two<00:01:35.280> which<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.210> 64<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.290> I've<00:01:37.770> got<00:01:37.979> less

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
times two which is 64 so I've got less

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.600 
times two which is 64 so I've got less
than<00:01:38.579> one<00:01:38.820> watt<00:01:39.000> per<00:01:39.240> gallon<00:01:39.600> on<00:01:40.200> my<00:01:41.009> 90<00:01:41.340> gallon

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
than one watt per gallon on my 90 gallon

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.490 
than one watt per gallon on my 90 gallon
tank<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:41.939> as<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.150> can<00:01:42.299> see<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:43.229> know<00:01:43.320> it's

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
tank and as you can see you know it's

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
had a coral life correct me if I'm wrong

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.770 
had a coral life correct me if I'm wrong
on<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:48.329> bro<00:01:48.680> coral<00:01:49.680> life<00:01:50.090> ballast<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.540> went

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
on this bro coral life ballast that went

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.010 
on this bro coral life ballast that went
out<00:01:51.869> on<00:01:52.049> him<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.350> he's<00:01:52.530> got<00:01:53.060> 240<00:01:54.060> watts<00:01:54.329> on<00:01:54.689> his

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
setting and how in different stages of

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.280 
setting and how in different stages of
the<00:02:13.709> year<00:02:13.980> they'll<00:02:14.340> be<00:02:14.519> like<00:02:15.299> completely<00:02:16.079> out

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
the year they'll be like completely out

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.849 
the year they'll be like completely out
almost<00:02:17.060> out<00:02:18.060> above<00:02:18.329> the<00:02:18.390> water<00:02:18.719> and<00:02:19.049> just<00:02:19.680> have

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:19.859 
almost out above the water and just have

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:21.949 
almost out above the water and just have
like<00:02:20.069> super<00:02:20.430> super<00:02:20.549> bright<00:02:20.819> sunlight<00:02:21.420> and

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
like super super bright sunlight and

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.839 
like super super bright sunlight and
then<00:02:22.109> in<00:02:22.200> other<00:02:22.349> parts<00:02:22.650> of<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:22.799> year<00:02:22.890> he

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
then in other parts of the year he

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.539 
then in other parts of the year he
showed<00:02:24.060> this<00:02:24.239> river<00:02:24.450> that<00:02:24.659> was<00:02:24.780> completely

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
showed this river that was completely

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.129 
showed this river that was completely
like<00:02:26.549> during<00:02:26.849> flooding<00:02:27.180> season<00:02:27.659> it<00:02:27.810> just<00:02:27.840> like

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:28.139 
like during flooding season it just like

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:29.899 
like during flooding season it just like
super<00:02:28.739> filled<00:02:28.980> up<00:02:29.159> and<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.459> plants<00:02:29.790> probably

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
super filled up and the plants probably

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.179 
super filled up and the plants probably
got<00:02:30.239> hardly<00:02:30.540> any<00:02:30.629> daylight<00:02:31.139> at<00:02:31.260> all<00:02:31.379> so<00:02:32.159> I

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:32.189 
got hardly any daylight at all so I

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:33.920 
got hardly any daylight at all so I
bring<00:02:32.549> this<00:02:32.670> up<00:02:32.819> because<00:02:32.879> plants<00:02:33.480> can<00:02:33.629> handle

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
bring this up because plants can handle

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.690 
bring this up because plants can handle
a<00:02:34.109> magnitude<00:02:34.620> of<00:02:34.769> light<00:02:34.950> now<00:02:35.129> the<00:02:35.189> plants<00:02:35.639> that

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
a magnitude of light now the plants that

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.910 
a magnitude of light now the plants that
I<00:02:35.849> talked<00:02:36.120> about<00:02:36.150> are<00:02:36.629> mainly<00:02:37.349> for<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.769> low

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
I talked about are mainly for the low

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.849 
I talked about are mainly for the low
tech<00:02:38.189> tanks<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:39.079> you<00:02:40.079> know<00:02:40.170> keep<00:02:40.349> that<00:02:40.409> in<00:02:40.680> mind

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:40.859 
tech tanks so you know keep that in mind

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:43.550 
tech tanks so you know keep that in mind
some<00:02:41.099> of<00:02:41.129> the<00:02:41.250> harder<00:02:41.549> stuff<00:02:42.439> some<00:02:43.439> of<00:02:43.470> the

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
some of the harder stuff some of the

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.250 
some of the harder stuff some of the
crazy<00:02:43.829> row<00:02:44.069> Tellez<00:02:44.519> and<00:02:44.849> stem<00:02:45.120> plants<00:02:45.569> they're

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
crazy row Tellez and stem plants they're

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.780 
crazy row Tellez and stem plants they're
gonna<00:02:46.409> need<00:02:46.620> a<00:02:46.680> lot<00:02:46.859> more<00:02:47.040> light<00:02:47.220> in<00:02:47.340> nutrients

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
gonna need a lot more light in nutrients

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.149 
gonna need a lot more light in nutrients
but<00:02:47.939> for<00:02:48.260> for<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.319> sake<00:02:49.530> of<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.739> plants<00:02:50.069> that

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
but for for the sake of the plants that

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:52.580 
but for for the sake of the plants that
I<00:02:50.220> sell<00:02:50.579> on<00:02:50.700> aquatic<00:02:50.939> jungles<00:02:51.419> and<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.349> stuff

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
they can handle some low light but

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.670 
they can handle some low light but
you've<00:02:56.400> gotta<00:02:56.579> feed<00:02:57.030> them<00:02:57.209> so<00:02:57.719> that's<00:02:58.319> kind<00:02:58.650> of

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
bro I should know that but um so it'd be

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.720 
bro I should know that but um so it'd be
interesting<00:03:07.019> to<00:03:07.349> know<00:03:07.409> if<00:03:07.650> he<00:03:07.799> if<00:03:08.129> he<00:03:08.159> hadn't

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
interesting to know if he if he hadn't

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.209 
interesting to know if he if he hadn't
heard<00:03:08.879> of<00:03:08.969> his<00:03:09.090> tank<00:03:09.530> he<00:03:10.530> would<00:03:10.680> need<00:03:10.889> all<00:03:11.099> that

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:11.219 
heard of his tank he would need all that

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:13.459 
heard of his tank he would need all that
more<00:03:11.430> light<00:03:11.639> because<00:03:12.239> his<00:03:12.389> plants<00:03:13.230> aren't

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:13.469 
more light because his plants aren't

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:16.250 
more light because his plants aren't
getting<00:03:13.680> enough<00:03:13.769> food<00:03:14.720> plants<00:03:15.720> can<00:03:15.900> adapt

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
getting enough food plants can adapt

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.309 
getting enough food plants can adapt
it's<00:03:16.560> part<00:03:16.889> of<00:03:16.949> their<00:03:17.099> natural<00:03:18.290> ability<00:03:19.290> to

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
it's part of their natural ability to

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.800 
it's part of their natural ability to
survive<00:03:19.829> like<00:03:20.340> it<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:20.790> water<00:03:21.060> level<00:03:21.449> goes<00:03:21.629> up

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
survive like it the water level goes up

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.240 
survive like it the water level goes up
in<00:03:21.989> a<00:03:22.049> stream<00:03:22.349> they<00:03:22.590> have<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:22.859> ability<00:03:23.220> to

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
in a stream they have the ability to

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.520 
in a stream they have the ability to
just<00:03:23.579> take<00:03:23.909> less<00:03:24.209> water<00:03:24.569> now<00:03:25.169> one<00:03:25.349> of<00:03:25.379> the

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
just take less water now one of the

just take less water now one of the
things<00:03:25.739> they<00:03:25.919> do<00:03:25.979> is<00:03:26.579> they<00:03:26.849> adjust<00:03:27.599> their

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750

bow<00:03:31.199> for<00:03:31.500> example<00:03:31.970> well<00:03:32.970> it's<00:03:33.150> a<00:03:33.209> bad<00:03:33.359> example

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:33.479 
bow for example well it's a bad example

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:35.719 
bow for example well it's a bad example

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:35.729 
but it sometimes people keep it in high

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:38.749 
but it sometimes people keep it in high
light<00:03:35.909> or<00:03:36.269> like<00:03:36.510> it<00:03:37.439> come<00:03:37.680> it's<00:03:37.949> it's<00:03:38.220> grown<00:03:38.579> in

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:38.759 
light or like it come it's it's grown in

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:39.979 
light or like it come it's it's grown in
high<00:03:38.849> light<00:03:39.060> and<00:03:39.269> it's<00:03:39.359> sold<00:03:39.569> into<00:03:39.750> a<00:03:39.780> low

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
high light and it's sold into a low

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.780 
high light and it's sold into a low
light<00:03:40.169> tank<00:03:40.439> well<00:03:40.650> it'll<00:03:40.889> melt<00:03:41.310> all<00:03:41.519> of<00:03:41.549> its

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
light tank well it'll melt all of its

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.309 
light tank well it'll melt all of its
leaves<00:03:41.939> and<00:03:42.120> come<00:03:42.389> back<00:03:42.509> crypts<00:03:42.840> do<00:03:43.019> the<00:03:43.109> same

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
leaves and come back crypts do the same

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.039 
leaves and come back crypts do the same
thing<00:03:44.269> all<00:03:45.269> those<00:03:45.449> leaves<00:03:45.689> will<00:03:45.750> come<00:03:45.840> back

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
thing all those leaves will come back

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.050 
thing all those leaves will come back
because<00:03:46.139> they're<00:03:46.349> used<00:03:46.620> to<00:03:46.799> growing<00:03:47.009> in<00:03:47.579> high

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
because they're used to growing in high

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.449 
because they're used to growing in high
light<00:03:48.299> to<00:03:48.569> converting<00:03:48.989> to<00:03:49.079> low<00:03:49.259> light<00:03:49.500> or<00:03:49.769> vice
