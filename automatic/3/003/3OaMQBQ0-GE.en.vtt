been teaching for a couple of years now
during<00:00:21.750> that<00:00:21.900> time<00:00:22.020> what<00:00:22.590> sort<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:22.859> impact

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
during that time what sort of impact

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.340 
during that time what sort of impact
have<00:00:23.430> you<00:00:23.460> seen<00:00:23.820> technology<00:00:24.210> have<00:00:24.810> on<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.260> way

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
have you seen technology have on the way

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.960 
have you seen technology have on the way
that<00:00:25.500> students<00:00:25.949> learn<00:00:26.130> well<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.789> big

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
that students learn well the big

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.029 
that students learn well the big
buzzword<00:00:27.240> these<00:00:27.480> days<00:00:27.689> is<00:00:28.109> Common<00:00:28.500> Core<00:00:28.680> and

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
buzzword these days is Common Core and

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.310 
buzzword these days is Common Core and
it's<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.609> something<00:00:30.269> about<00:00:30.510> these<00:00:30.869> different

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
it's a something about these different

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.780 
it's a something about these different
standards<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:32.099> aren't<00:00:32.309> just<00:00:32.399> preparing

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
standards that aren't just preparing

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.340 
standards that aren't just preparing
students<00:00:33.210> for<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.510> classroom<00:00:33.930> but<00:00:34.200> for

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
students for the classroom but for

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.139 
students for the classroom but for
everyday<00:00:34.590> life<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.070> technology<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:35.940> one<00:00:36.059> of

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
everyday life and technology is one of

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.030 
everyday life and technology is one of
those<00:00:36.270> big<00:00:36.570> parts<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:36.960> it<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.230> you're<00:00:37.920> going

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
those big parts of it and you're going

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.440 
those big parts of it and you're going
to<00:00:38.070> see<00:00:38.250> in<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.430> future<00:00:38.550> students<00:00:39.270> are<00:00:39.329> going

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
to see in the future students are going

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.580 
to see in the future students are going
to<00:00:39.510> have<00:00:39.600> textbooks<00:00:39.840> they're<00:00:40.320> going<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.500> have

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
to have textbooks they're going to have

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.110 
to have textbooks they're going to have
tablets<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.070> laptops<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.610> they're<00:00:41.940> going

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
tablets and laptops that they're going

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.310 
tablets and laptops that they're going
to<00:00:42.180> be<00:00:42.239> able<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.390> get<00:00:42.540> all<00:00:42.629> their<00:00:42.780> content<00:00:43.200> with

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
to be able to get all their content with

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.959 
to be able to get all their content with
and<00:00:43.530> so<00:00:43.800> it's<00:00:43.920> really<00:00:44.100> important<00:00:44.789> for<00:00:44.820> us

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
and so it's really important for us

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.459 
and so it's really important for us
because<00:00:45.390> now<00:00:45.750> these<00:00:45.960> standards<00:00:46.289> are<00:00:46.350> more

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
because now these standards are more

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.260 
because now these standards are more
student<00:00:46.829> centric<00:00:47.219> students<00:00:47.850> work<00:00:48.000> with<00:00:48.149> each

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
student centric students work with each

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.060 
student centric students work with each
other<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.780> technology's<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.440> way<00:00:49.620> for<00:00:49.800> them<00:00:49.920> to

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
other and technology's a way for them to

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.100 
other and technology's a way for them to
be<00:00:50.160> able<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.399> work<00:00:50.879> together<00:00:51.059> which<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.809> really

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
be able to work together which is really

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.770 
be able to work together which is really
great<00:00:52.289> nice<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.250> then<00:00:53.730> specifically<00:00:54.570> with

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
great nice and then specifically with

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.650 
great nice and then specifically with
math<00:00:55.050> that's<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.500> subject<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:56.010> teach

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
math that's a subject that you teach

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.970 
math that's a subject that you teach
what<00:00:57.660> sort<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:57.989> impact<00:00:58.350> have<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:58.739> seen

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
what sort of impact have you seen

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.430 
what sort of impact have you seen
technology<00:00:59.309> have<00:00:59.850> on<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.690> delivery<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.350> the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
technology have on the delivery and the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.590 
technology have on the delivery and the
consumption<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:02.100> those<00:01:02.699> specific<00:01:03.300> math

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
consumption of those specific math

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.660 
consumption of those specific math
standards<00:01:04.199> technology<00:01:04.650> makes<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:05.549> much

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
standards technology makes it so much

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.789 
standards technology makes it so much
easier<00:01:05.729> especially<00:01:06.420> for<00:01:06.689> differentiation<00:01:07.409> I

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
easier especially for differentiation I

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:08.960 
easier especially for differentiation I
have<00:01:08.100> different<00:01:08.400> students<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:08.790> are

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
have different students that are

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
the next day and technology helps helps

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.319 
the next day and technology helps helps
be<00:01:32.070> able<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.280> get<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.520> information<00:01:33.000> out

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
be able to get that information out

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.719 
be able to get that information out
sooner<00:01:33.630> great<00:01:34.049> yeah<00:01:34.409> we've<00:01:35.189> synthesized

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
sooner great yeah we've synthesized

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.789 
sooner great yeah we've synthesized
feedback<00:01:36.240> for<00:01:36.509> math<00:01:36.689> teachers<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:37.439> I've

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
feedback for math teachers and I've

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.920 
feedback for math teachers and I've
identified<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.250> few<00:01:38.610> key<00:01:38.909> components<00:01:39.119> for

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
identified a few key components for

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.810 
identified a few key components for
developers<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.409> prioritize<00:01:41.040> when<00:01:41.369> developing

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
developers to prioritize when developing

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.359 
developers to prioritize when developing
math<00:01:42.119> apps<00:01:42.530> it's<00:01:43.530> important<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.040> these<00:01:44.100> apps

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
math apps it's important that these apps

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.280 
math apps it's important that these apps
have<00:01:44.939> content<00:01:45.420> that's<00:01:45.540> highly<00:01:46.020> scaffolded

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
have content that's highly scaffolded

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.920 
have content that's highly scaffolded
that<00:01:47.220> they<00:01:47.340> have<00:01:47.460> offline<00:01:47.939> functionality<00:01:48.210> and

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
that they have offline functionality and

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.740 
that they have offline functionality and
that<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.799> content<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.520> mapped<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.450> common

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
that the content is mapped to the common

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.230 
that the content is mapped to the common
core<00:01:52.159> so<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.220> mentioned<00:01:53.430> differentiation

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
core so you mentioned differentiation

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.660 
core so you mentioned differentiation
earlier<00:01:54.600> so<00:01:55.320> why<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:55.560> scaffolded<00:01:56.219> content

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
earlier so why is scaffolded content

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.490 
earlier so why is scaffolded content
something<00:01:56.880> that's<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.360> crucial<00:01:57.719> for<00:01:58.290> an<00:01:58.380> app

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
something that's so crucial for an app

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.510 
something that's so crucial for an app
that's<00:01:58.710> going<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:58.890> be<00:01:58.979> used<00:01:59.130> in<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.369> classroom

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
that's going to be used in the classroom

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.580 
that's going to be used in the classroom
well<00:02:00.299> even<00:02:00.600> though<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.719> only<00:02:00.810> teach<00:02:01.259> sixth

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
well even though I only teach sixth

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.840 
well even though I only teach sixth
graders<00:02:01.860> they<00:02:02.070> need<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.369> know<00:02:02.520> all<00:02:02.729> the

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
graders they need to know all the

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.700 
graders they need to know all the
content<00:02:03.270> from<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.450> previous<00:02:03.630> years<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.409> if

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
content from the previous years and if

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.350 
content from the previous years and if
students<00:02:05.070> are<00:02:05.159> able<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.399> access<00:02:05.640> that<00:02:05.939> in<00:02:06.119> one

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
students are able to access that in one

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.300 
students are able to access that in one
app<00:02:06.509> without<00:02:06.899> being<00:02:07.259> told<00:02:07.500> that's<00:02:07.920> really

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
app without being told that's really

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.699 
app without being told that's really
powerful<00:02:08.539> another<00:02:09.539> thing<00:02:09.780> too<00:02:10.020> is<00:02:10.259> that<00:02:10.289> it

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
powerful another thing too is that it

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.410 
powerful another thing too is that it
gives<00:02:10.830> instant<00:02:11.250> feedback<00:02:11.489> so<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.270> when

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
gives instant feedback so that when

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.940 
gives instant feedback so that when
students<00:02:12.810> are<00:02:12.959> actually<00:02:13.140> doing<00:02:13.770> the

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
students are actually doing the

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.260 
students are actually doing the
different<00:02:14.250> games<00:02:14.489> and<00:02:14.700> stuff<00:02:14.940> in<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.120> app

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
different games and stuff in the app

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.420 
different games and stuff in the app
they're<00:02:15.930> really<00:02:16.290> learning<00:02:16.560> old<00:02:17.040> stuff<00:02:17.400> but

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
they're really learning old stuff but

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.680 
they're really learning old stuff but
they're<00:02:17.760> actually<00:02:18.090> also<00:02:18.239> teaching

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
they're actually also teaching

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.930 
they're actually also teaching
themselves<00:02:18.840> new<00:02:19.260> stuff<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:19.680> let's<00:02:20.459> be<00:02:20.580> honest

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
themselves new stuff and let's be honest

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.820 
themselves new stuff and let's be honest
if<00:02:21.150> you<00:02:21.660> actually<00:02:21.870> get<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.260> from<00:02:22.440> a<00:02:22.500> talking

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
if you actually get it from a talking

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.710 
if you actually get it from a talking
character<00:02:23.340> besides<00:02:23.580> a<00:02:23.849> teacher<00:02:24.060> you're<00:02:24.480> more

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
character besides a teacher you're more

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.990 
character besides a teacher you're more
likely<00:02:24.959> to<00:02:25.290> be<00:02:25.470> willing<00:02:25.769> to<00:02:25.950> remember<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:26.519> so

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
likely to be willing to remember it so

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.490 
likely to be willing to remember it so
it<00:02:27.120> gives<00:02:27.300> students<00:02:27.660> a<00:02:27.750> little<00:02:27.900> bit<00:02:28.019> more<00:02:28.319> of

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
it gives students a little bit more of

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.020 
it gives students a little bit more of
an<00:02:28.650> independence<00:02:29.220> of<00:02:29.400> their<00:02:29.580> learning<00:02:29.730> and

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
an independence of their learning and

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.790 
an independence of their learning and
they<00:02:30.630> get<00:02:30.780> to<00:02:30.870> know<00:02:31.019> what<00:02:31.260> they<00:02:31.380> don't<00:02:31.620> know

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
they get to know what they don't know

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.890 
they get to know what they don't know
and<00:02:32.010> be<00:02:32.430> able<00:02:32.519> to<00:02:32.640> make<00:02:32.819> that<00:02:32.940> stronger<00:02:33.239> got<00:02:33.810> it

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
and be able to make that stronger got it

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.740 
and be able to make that stronger got it
and<00:02:34.080> then<00:02:34.769> with<00:02:35.489> offline<00:02:35.849> functionality<00:02:36.180> why

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
and then with offline functionality why

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.210 
and then with offline functionality why
is<00:02:36.840> that<00:02:36.989> something<00:02:37.380> that<00:02:37.410> a<00:02:37.620> developer

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
is that something that a developer

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.680 
is that something that a developer
should<00:02:38.400> be<00:02:38.489> keeping<00:02:38.819> top<00:02:39.030> of<00:02:39.209> mind<00:02:39.420> when

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
should be keeping top of mind when

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.030 
should be keeping top of mind when
they're<00:02:39.840> going<00:02:40.049> through<00:02:40.380> and<00:02:40.620> creating<00:02:40.769> an

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
they're going through and creating an

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.949 
they're going through and creating an
app<00:02:41.160> well<00:02:41.610> we<00:02:41.760> live<00:02:41.940> in<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.120> digital<00:02:42.269> age<00:02:42.599> but

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
app well we live in the digital age but

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.390 
app well we live in the digital age but
not<00:02:43.140> all<00:02:43.290> of<00:02:43.410> our<00:02:43.500> buildings<00:02:43.950> and<00:02:44.099> structures

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
not all of our buildings and structures

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.699 
not all of our buildings and structures
are<00:02:44.760> at<00:02:45.299> the<00:02:45.480> area<00:02:45.959> that<00:02:46.019> we<00:02:46.200> need<00:02:46.349> them<00:02:46.530> to<00:02:46.680> be

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
are at the area that we need them to be

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.460 
are at the area that we need them to be
so<00:02:47.099> personally<00:02:47.640> our<00:02:47.819> Wi-Fi<00:02:48.269> works<00:02:48.870> about<00:02:49.200> 80

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
so personally our Wi-Fi works about 80

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.620 
so personally our Wi-Fi works about 80
percent<00:02:49.890> of<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.040> time<00:02:50.220> so<00:02:50.519> 20<00:02:51.120> percent<00:02:51.269> of<00:02:51.540> the

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
percent of the time so 20 percent of the

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.449 
percent of the time so 20 percent of the
time<00:02:51.780> I<00:02:51.989> need<00:02:52.170> a<00:02:52.200> plan<00:02:52.470> B<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:52.860> so<00:02:53.250> having

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
time I need a plan B and so having

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.789 
time I need a plan B and so having
offline<00:02:53.880> capability<00:02:54.480> is<00:02:54.630> super<00:02:55.349> important

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
offline capability is super important

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.920 
offline capability is super important
another<00:02:56.579> thing<00:02:56.849> too<00:02:57.060> is<00:02:57.090> that<00:02:57.299> it<00:02:57.750> limits

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
another thing too is that it limits

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.780 
another thing too is that it limits
distractions<00:02:58.650> sometimes<00:02:59.099> because<00:02:59.610> if

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
distractions sometimes because if

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.460 
distractions sometimes because if
students<00:03:00.209> do<00:03:00.360> have<00:03:00.480> access<00:03:00.690> to<00:03:00.989> the<00:03:01.079> internet

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
students do have access to the internet

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.319 
students do have access to the internet
and<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:02.310> know<00:03:02.430> they're<00:03:02.790> going<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.000> go<00:03:03.120> online

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
and you know they're going to go online

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.600 
and you know they're going to go online
and<00:03:03.840> do<00:03:04.170> all<00:03:04.319> the<00:03:04.440> other<00:03:04.560> things<00:03:04.829> besides<00:03:05.370> the

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
and do all the other things besides the

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.270 
and do all the other things besides the
math<00:03:05.819> that<00:03:06.030> they<00:03:06.150> need<00:03:06.329> to<00:03:06.450> be<00:03:06.540> doing<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:07.280> the

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
math that they need to be doing and the

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.009 
math that they need to be doing and the
other<00:03:08.430> thing<00:03:08.730> is<00:03:08.910> if<00:03:09.150> they<00:03:09.329> can<00:03:09.510> get<00:03:09.930> it

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
other thing is if they can get it

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.750 
other thing is if they can get it
anywhere<00:03:10.440> anytime<00:03:10.620> they're<00:03:11.220> probably<00:03:11.610> can

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
anywhere anytime they're probably can

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.819 
anywhere anytime they're probably can
use<00:03:11.880> it<00:03:12.030> more<00:03:12.060> outside<00:03:12.840> of<00:03:12.989> school<00:03:13.170> than<00:03:13.560> just

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
use it more outside of school than just

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.380 
use it more outside of school than just
in<00:03:13.980> school<00:03:14.220> where<00:03:14.340> they<00:03:14.459> have<00:03:14.579> Wi-Fi<00:03:14.760> got<00:03:15.269> it

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
in school where they have Wi-Fi got it

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.449 
in school where they have Wi-Fi got it
make<00:03:15.720> sense<00:03:15.900> yeah<00:03:16.319> and<00:03:17.160> then<00:03:17.280> you<00:03:17.340> mentioned

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
make sense yeah and then you mentioned

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.090 
make sense yeah and then you mentioned
Common<00:03:17.910> Core<00:03:18.150> earlier<00:03:18.630> so<00:03:19.139> from<00:03:19.560> a<00:03:19.829> teacher

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100

capability<00:04:31.680> where<00:04:32.040> students<00:04:32.430> can<00:04:32.550> be<00:04:32.669> able<00:04:32.760> to

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
capability where students can be able to

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.760 
capability where students can be able to
use<00:04:33.060> it<00:04:33.210> anywhere<00:04:33.690> at<00:04:33.900> anytime<00:04:34.169> which<00:04:34.620> is

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
use it anywhere at anytime which is

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.140 
use it anywhere at anytime which is
really<00:04:35.070> great<00:04:35.280> for<00:04:35.310> them<00:04:35.580> in<00:04:35.820> the<00:04:36.060> classroom

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
really great for them in the classroom

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.820 
really great for them in the classroom
when<00:04:36.540> we<00:04:36.660> don't<00:04:36.810> have<00:04:36.930> Wi-Fi<00:04:37.230> and<00:04:37.440> also<00:04:37.740> at

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
when we don't have Wi-Fi and also at

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.890 
when we don't have Wi-Fi and also at
home<00:04:38.010> if<00:04:38.310> they<00:04:38.400> don't<00:04:38.550> have<00:04:38.639> access<00:04:38.940> nice<00:04:39.600> and

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
home if they don't have access nice and

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.980 
home if they don't have access nice and
then<00:04:40.470> with<00:04:41.070> matific<00:04:41.460> what<00:04:41.820> makes<00:04:42.000> that<00:04:42.240> an<00:04:42.510> app

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
then with matific what makes that an app

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.110 
then with matific what makes that an app
that's<00:04:43.230> important<00:04:43.919> for<00:04:44.010> other<00:04:44.490> math<00:04:44.760> teachers

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
that's important for other math teachers

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.510 
that's important for other math teachers
to<00:04:45.300> consider<00:04:45.630> well<00:04:46.110> it's<00:04:46.350> highly<00:04:46.800> aligned

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
to consider well it's highly aligned

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.830 
to consider well it's highly aligned
with<00:04:47.730> the<00:04:47.790> Common<00:04:48.090> Core<00:04:48.180> Standards<00:04:48.600> you<00:04:48.720> can

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
with the Common Core Standards you can

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.270 
with the Common Core Standards you can
actually<00:04:49.080> find<00:04:49.230> a<00:04:49.320> standard<00:04:49.680> and<00:04:49.889> work<00:04:50.100> with

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
actually find a standard and work with

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.850 
actually find a standard and work with
it<00:04:50.430> which<00:04:50.880> is<00:04:50.910> really<00:04:51.360> great<00:04:51.570> it's<00:04:51.860> developed

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
it which is really great it's developed

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.860 
it which is really great it's developed
by<00:04:52.919> early<00:04:53.280> age<00:04:53.430> math<00:04:53.700> experts<00:04:54.210> so<00:04:54.480> it's<00:04:54.600> coming

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
by early age math experts so it's coming

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.480 
by early age math experts so it's coming
from<00:04:55.020> math<00:04:55.320> people<00:04:55.620> which<00:04:56.040> is<00:04:56.190> really

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
from math people which is really

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.730 
from math people which is really
important<00:04:56.970> and<00:04:57.090> it<00:04:57.540> also<00:04:57.720> goes<00:04:58.230> with<00:04:58.470> some<00:04:58.620> of

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
important and it also goes with some of

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.110 
important and it also goes with some of
the<00:04:58.800> different<00:04:59.070> curriculum<00:04:59.250> programs<00:04:59.910> such

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
the different curriculum programs such

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.150 
the different curriculum programs such
as<00:05:00.150> envision<00:05:00.630> math<00:05:00.810> everyday<00:05:01.470> math<00:05:01.680> and<00:05:01.950> go

as envision math everyday math and go

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.440 
as envision math everyday math and go
math<00:05:02.370> which<00:05:02.669> is<00:05:02.820> actually<00:05:03.090> a<00:05:03.120> textbook<00:05:03.360> that

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
math which is actually a textbook that

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.150 
math which is actually a textbook that
we're<00:05:03.690> currently<00:05:03.870> using<00:05:04.020> very<00:05:04.740> cool<00:05:04.980> so

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
we're currently using very cool so

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.470 
we're currently using very cool so
something<00:05:05.460> it<00:05:05.550> can<00:05:05.669> be<00:05:05.700> a<00:05:05.760> huge<00:05:06.030> time<00:05:06.060> saver

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
something it can be a huge time saver

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.330 
something it can be a huge time saver
for<00:05:06.570> teachers<00:05:07.020> which<00:05:07.260> obviously<00:05:08.070> is<00:05:08.160> going<00:05:08.280> to

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
for teachers which obviously is going to

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.130 
for teachers which obviously is going to
affect<00:05:08.610> adoption<00:05:09.120> yeah<00:05:09.419> and<00:05:09.660> students<00:05:09.990> don't

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
affect adoption yeah and students don't

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.240 
affect adoption yeah and students don't
know<00:05:10.290> they're<00:05:10.470> learning<00:05:10.620> cuz<00:05:10.919> we're<00:05:11.040> playing

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
know they're learning cuz we're playing
