00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.040
 hi everyone today I you 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.230
 present the nail art I was wearing for 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.670
 the world spa &amp; beauty fair in paris 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.830
 so it's lace 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.350
 I started by laying down my base and a 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.950
 nude varnish as well as a varnish to 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.110
 flakes 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:26.619
 I will add a little more 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.150
 free glitter so I wanted to said 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.330
 these are free glitters i'm going 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.520
 so grab them and drop them on my 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.739
 varnish that is not yet dry for that 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.680
 glitter can stick can 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:41.290
 adhere to it so I'm going to ask 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.480
 glitter different sizes on a 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.239
 side the moment that I do not put especially 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.070
 the nail in fact I imagine where I 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.680
 I'll put my lace and put them on 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.760
 glitter at that place so rather 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.230
 on one side actually 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.120
 so never a little bit everywhere on the 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.100
 side and I'm going to put some top coat by 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.809
 on it you do not have to 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.180
 do I prefer to do it so that 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.710
 it's smoother and better 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.270
 to draw would subsequently 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.310
 so for me a motive I will use 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.369
 my brush and acrylic paint 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.049
 black 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:19.909
 so I'm going to start tracing my 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:23.090
 pattern so on the side I'm going to make some 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.500
 climbing in fact so I'm doing 3 3 apples 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.509
 three bridges wide enough 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.850
 so on the side where I put them 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:31.840
 glitter and then I'm going to do that 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.390
 a second time 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.130
 I will draw a second a second 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.200
 very much I'm going to double the trait all 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:42.630
 simply so you do I do traits 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:45.880
 nitro is neither too thick for this very 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.790
 then I'm going to add a little 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.820
 pretty simple lace quite discreet on 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.410
 on the outside so you see that's 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.990
 just small pots have so 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.409
 I'm trying to make enough bridges 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.060
 regular quite similar 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.490
 so I decided to make a lace 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.200
 not too complicated since there will be 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.909
 lots of other details besides I 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.759
 did not want to overload 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.970
 more then I use a brush more 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.940
 fun and water and I'm going to come and draw a 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:19.019
 gridlines so to start I trace 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.790
 to be fn parallel and so after that 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.890
 will serve me to make a grid one 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.560
 fishnet on which I would like to do my 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.230
 lace so I do it mostly corner 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.940
 of my nail over the glitter 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.400
 and so I try to do something 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.200
 of fairly regular das eiffel so for 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.459
 to do very weak I advise you 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.239
 to dilute a little bit your painting 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.370
 acrylic 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.680
 if it's not fluid enough like that 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.409
 you will not work easily and 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.599
 to make the most regular features 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:49.049
 possible it is necessary to impregnate a small 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:51.020
 little and stall at best to try to 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.450
 shake as little as possible 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.310
 so we refined other grids I 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.790
 now go take a brush a 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.010
 little bit bigger to trace the 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.270
 fashion details made at it so you 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.550
 can put what you want like 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.470
 pattern in your lace you can 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.000
 put some arabesque leaves 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.250
 Baroque patterns that you can put 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.410
 flowers also you really put this 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.240
 that you want me I decided to 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.980
 put small tarbaise that there are 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.450
 places like small leaves 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.370
 so here I am doing my 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.830
 arabesques you see I 'm doing it 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:25.190
 more or less thick there are places 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.740
 shown is thinner than others so 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.500
 when I do a very thick I crush a 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:33.170
 little bit my brush as I am in 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.580
 doing it so that's what is 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.540
 pretty I find the difference in thickness 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.430
 stroke 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.319
 then always with the same bread jumping 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.319
 I'm going to come add small 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:46.239
 drops on on the outside asks a 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.849
 such a nickname such as I did at all 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.319
 start so I'm going to add drops 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:52.750
 who are really very very small you 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.610
 see it so I put it intervals 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.799
 regular but I do not do too much too 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.379
 tight to make it not overload 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:01.659
 again so to close drops 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:04.930
 I do not support I put the point then 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:08.019
 after I crush slightly then I 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.569
 will take a back thing and with the 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:12.640
 side most does the smallest i'm going 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.190
 come in add small dots so I 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.400
 put one point each time where I 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.229
 did not make any drops 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.609
 then I can also add points 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:23.229
 a little bigger inside 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.510
 asking such to fill the holes 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:28.570
 and to finish as always I put 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.580
 top coat to last and protect 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.229
 my decor to protect the painting 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.760
 acrylic 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:35.620
 so here I made this decoration especially 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.910
 my nails except that lace is not 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.100
 not always positioned the same 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.099
 way and on the ring finger I did my 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.080
 resin marc esi and especially the angle you 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:45.700
