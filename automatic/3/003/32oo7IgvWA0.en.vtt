just going to kind of freehand it so

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.139 
just going to kind of freehand it so
this<00:01:58.259> may<00:01:58.439> not<00:01:58.469> look<00:01:58.829> perfect<00:01:59.159> but<00:01:59.969> that's

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
this may not look perfect but that's

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.090 
this may not look perfect but that's
because<00:02:00.659> it's<00:02:00.899> my<00:02:01.020> horse<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.590> my<00:02:01.649> horse<00:02:01.950> is

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
because it's my horse and my horse is

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.060 
because it's my horse and my horse is
going<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.310> be<00:02:02.430> unique<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:03.890> we're<00:02:04.890> going<00:02:05.009> to

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
going to be unique so we're going to

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.839 
going to be unique so we're going to
make<00:02:05.250> one<00:02:05.549> half<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.450> our<00:02:06.689> felt<00:02:07.020> piece<00:02:07.849> we're

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
make one half of our felt piece we're

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.080 
make one half of our felt piece we're
going<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.090> just<00:02:09.840> kind<00:02:10.020> of<00:02:10.489> go<00:02:11.489> long<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:11.970> then

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
going to just kind of go long and then

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.510 
going to just kind of go long and then
make

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
make

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.410 
make
points<00:02:12.730> for<00:02:12.940> our<00:02:13.000> ears<00:02:13.510> because<00:02:14.170> horses<00:02:14.710> have

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
points for our ears because horses have

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.530 
points for our ears because horses have
kind<00:02:16.420> of<00:02:16.540> pointed<00:02:17.110> ears<00:02:17.410> and<00:02:18.420> then<00:02:19.420> we're

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
going to make so that's that your shape

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.500 
going to make so that's that your shape
there<00:02:21.670> and<00:02:21.850> I'm<00:02:21.910> going<00:02:22.060> to<00:02:22.090> make<00:02:22.210> it<00:02:22.330> right

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
there and I'm going to make it right

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:31.050 
there and I'm going to make it right
here<00:02:22.750> at<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:22.900> other<00:02:23.020> end<00:02:23.200> too<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:30.610> so<00:02:30.850> now<00:02:31.030> I

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
here at the other end too and so now I

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.580 
here at the other end too and so now I
have<00:02:31.480> a<00:02:31.510> piece<00:02:31.750> that<00:02:31.990> kind<00:02:32.140> of<00:02:32.260> looks<00:02:32.410> like<00:02:32.470> a

crazy mustache all right so what you're
going<00:02:35.410> to<00:02:35.440> do<00:02:35.620> with<00:02:35.740> this<00:02:35.920> piece<00:02:36.220> is<00:02:36.550> you're

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
going to do with this piece is you're

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.940 
going to do with this piece is you're
going<00:02:37.390> to<00:02:37.450> measure<00:02:37.630> out<00:02:37.930> first<00:02:38.230> on<00:02:38.470> your<00:02:38.500> horse

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
going to measure out first on your horse

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.440 
going to measure out first on your horse
so<00:02:39.490> you're<00:02:39.640> going<00:02:39.760> to<00:02:39.790> take<00:02:40.030> it<00:02:40.240> and<00:02:40.330> you're

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
so you're going to take it and you're

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.110 
so you're going to take it and you're
going<00:02:40.540> to<00:02:40.600> see<00:02:41.100> where<00:02:42.100> the<00:02:42.310> middle<00:02:42.610> is

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
going to see where the middle is

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.810 
going to see where the middle is
because<00:02:43.900> it's<00:02:44.080> going<00:02:44.170> to<00:02:44.230> go<00:02:44.470> straight<00:02:45.460> up<00:02:45.580> on

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
because it's going to go straight up on

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:46.760 
because it's going to go straight up on
the<00:02:45.940> horse<00:02:46.180> like<00:02:46.360> that

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770
