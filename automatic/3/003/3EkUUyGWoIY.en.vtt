are<00:00:52.079> what<00:00:52.500> we're<00:00:52.620> going<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.890> be<00:00:53.100> drawing<00:00:53.390> so

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
are what we're going to be drawing so

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.810 
are what we're going to be drawing so
it's<00:00:55.230> going<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.649> be<00:00:55.800> kind<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.129> like<00:00:56.250> adding<00:00:56.460> an

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
it's going to be kind of like adding an

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.139 
it's going to be kind of like adding an
extra<00:00:57.300> petal<00:00:57.719> if<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:57.960> think<00:00:58.170> about<00:00:58.609> this<00:00:59.609> top

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
extra petal if you think about this top

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.779 
extra petal if you think about this top
view<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.840> combination<00:01:01.230> 8<00:01:01.559> as<00:01:01.800> having<00:01:02.430> four

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
view of a combination 8 as having four

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.179 
view of a combination 8 as having four
petals<00:01:03.470> we're<00:01:04.470> going<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.650> be<00:01:04.710> adding<00:01:04.979> four

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
petals we're going to be adding four

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.060 
petals we're going to be adding four
extra<00:01:05.580> petals<00:01:06.020> in<00:01:07.020> between<00:01:07.530> those<00:01:07.920> other

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
extra petals in between those other

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.670 
extra petals in between those other
petals<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:08.939> what<00:01:09.330> you'll<00:01:09.479> do<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:09.869> you'll<00:01:10.380> find

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
petals so what you'll do is you'll find

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.390 
petals so what you'll do is you'll find
those<00:01:11.100> four<00:01:11.840> points<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.590> drew<00:01:14.040> on<00:01:14.100> your

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
those four points that you drew on your

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.870 
those four points that you drew on your
combination<00:01:15.000> eight<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:16.759> we'll<00:01:17.759> be

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
combination eight and we'll be

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.590 
combination eight and we'll be
connecting<00:01:18.450> those<00:01:18.930> four<00:01:19.590> points<00:01:20.450> so<00:01:21.450> you'll

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
connecting those four points so you'll

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.190 
connecting those four points so you'll
go<00:01:21.720> from<00:01:21.900> one<00:01:22.110> point<00:01:22.380> down<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:24.229> the<00:01:25.340> equator

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
go from one point down to the equator

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.240 
go from one point down to the equator
and<00:01:29.960> that's<00:01:30.960> how<00:01:31.200> you'll<00:01:31.470> start<00:01:31.920> your<00:01:32.040> line

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
and that's how you'll start your line

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.690 
and that's how you'll start your line
and<00:01:32.960> I'm<00:01:33.960> doing<00:01:34.290> mine<00:01:34.560> in<00:01:34.710> right<00:01:34.920> here<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:35.520> it's

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
and I'm doing mine in right here so it's

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.969 
and I'm doing mine in right here so it's
easy<00:01:35.909> for<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.420> see<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.140> you'll<00:01:37.829> continue

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
easy for you to see and you'll continue

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.319 
easy for you to see and you'll continue
around<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:39.030> you'll<00:01:39.930> find<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.500> next<00:01:40.710> point<00:01:41.329> on

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
around and you'll find the next point on

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.569 
around and you'll find the next point on
the<00:01:43.189> on<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.310> south<00:01:44.549> side<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.780> your<00:01:45.899> ball<00:01:46.579> okay

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
the on the south side of your ball okay

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.580 
the on the south side of your ball okay
and<00:01:47.880> you'll<00:01:48.210> go<00:01:48.360> around<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:49.049> you'll<00:01:49.200> connect

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
and you'll go around and you'll connect

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:57.109 
and you'll go around and you'll connect
to<00:01:50.149> the<00:01:51.149> next<00:01:51.450> point<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:55.790> as<00:01:56.790> you'll<00:01:57.000> go

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
to the next point and as you'll go

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.399 
to the next point and as you'll go
around<00:01:57.390> you'll<00:01:57.689> just<00:01:57.840> notice<00:01:58.020> that

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
around you'll just notice that

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.480 
around you'll just notice that
everything<00:01:58.770> will<00:01:59.159> just<00:01:59.280> easily<00:02:00.180> line<00:02:00.540> up<00:02:01.490> then

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
everything will just easily line up then

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.910 
everything will just easily line up then
the<00:02:02.939> next<00:02:03.240> point<00:02:03.450> is<00:02:03.689> going<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.049> be<00:02:04.200> the

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
the next point is going to be the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.290 
the next point is going to be the
equator<00:02:05.399> line<00:02:06.380> and<00:02:07.380> you'll<00:02:08.280> basically<00:02:08.459> just

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
equator line and you'll basically just

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.449 
equator line and you'll basically just
keep<00:02:09.660> pulling<00:02:09.989> around<00:02:10.110> your<00:02:10.440> ball<00:02:10.590> until<00:02:10.890> you

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
keep pulling around your ball until you

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.000 
keep pulling around your ball until you
meet<00:02:11.790> up<00:02:11.970> again<00:02:12.239> on<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.599> other

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
meet up again on the other

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:22.870 
meet up again on the other
so<00:02:13.220> let<00:02:13.310> me<00:02:13.370> go<00:02:13.519> ahead<00:02:13.550> and<00:02:13.700> speed<00:02:14.060> this<00:02:14.239> up

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.730 

all<00:02:23.630> right<00:02:23.720> so<00:02:23.900> now<00:02:24.020> we've<00:02:24.170> drawn<00:02:24.380> our<00:02:24.500> first

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
all right so now we've drawn our first

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:25.810 
all right so now we've drawn our first
line<00:02:24.920> we're<00:02:25.100> going<00:02:25.190> to<00:02:25.280> go<00:02:25.370> ahead<00:02:25.490> and<00:02:25.730> get

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
line we're going to go ahead and get

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.240 
line we're going to go ahead and get
started<00:02:26.180> on<00:02:26.300> our<00:02:26.420> second<00:02:26.840> line<00:02:26.990> and<00:02:27.290> it'll<00:02:28.160> be

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
started on our second line and it'll be

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.300 
started on our second line and it'll be
going<00:02:28.400> in<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:28.820> opposite<00:02:29.570> direction<00:02:30.310> crossing

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
going in the opposite direction crossing

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.600 
going in the opposite direction crossing
over<00:02:31.750> that<00:02:32.750> first<00:02:33.560> line<00:02:33.740> you<00:02:33.920> just<00:02:33.950> drew<00:02:34.450> and

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
over that first line you just drew and

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.240 
over that first line you just drew and
you'll<00:02:37.610> connect<00:02:37.970> that<00:02:38.290> points<00:02:39.290> there<00:02:39.560> with

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
you'll connect that points there with

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.890 
you'll connect that points there with
the<00:02:40.820> equator<00:02:41.590> just<00:02:42.590> like<00:02:42.710> you<00:02:42.830> did<00:02:42.980> before

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
the equator just like you did before

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.780 
the equator just like you did before
around<00:02:44.900> to<00:02:45.320> the<00:02:45.440> other<00:02:45.590> side<00:02:45.950> it's<00:02:46.460> the<00:02:46.610> next

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
around to the other side it's the next

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:54.610 
around to the other side it's the next
point<00:02:48.850> okay<00:02:49.850> and<00:02:50.560> on<00:02:51.560> around<00:02:53.410> and<00:02:54.410> you<00:02:54.560> know

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
point okay and on around and you know

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.260 
point okay and on around and you know
just<00:02:54.830> considering<00:02:55.550> around<00:02:55.880> just<00:02:56.090> like<00:02:56.210> you

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
just considering around just like you

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:08.390 
just considering around just like you
did<00:02:56.510> before

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.280 

alright<00:03:09.030> so<00:03:09.269> from<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.569> side<00:03:09.720> view<00:03:09.870> here<00:03:09.959> we

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
alright so from the side view here we

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.559 
alright so from the side view here we
can<00:03:10.470> see<00:03:10.709> how<00:03:11.250> we've<00:03:11.400> created<00:03:11.700> that<00:03:12.060> extra

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
can see how we've created that extra

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.460 
can see how we've created that extra
petal<00:03:12.989> the<00:03:13.709> red<00:03:14.010> petal<00:03:14.670> in<00:03:14.849> the<00:03:14.909> middle<00:03:15.720> of<00:03:16.049> our

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
petal the red petal in the middle of our

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.339 
petal the red petal in the middle of our
two<00:03:17.459> black<00:03:17.790> petals<00:03:18.209> or<00:03:18.510> you<00:03:18.750> can<00:03:18.930> think<00:03:19.049> of<00:03:19.230> it

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
two black petals or you can think of it

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.190 
two black petals or you can think of it
as<00:03:19.379> a<00:03:19.890> red<00:03:20.099> triangle<00:03:20.430> up<00:03:21.090> in<00:03:21.629> the<00:03:21.780> middle<00:03:22.019> of

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
as a red triangle up in the middle of

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.920 
as a red triangle up in the middle of
two<00:03:22.560> black<00:03:22.950> triangles<00:03:23.580> and<00:03:23.730> here's<00:03:24.060> a<00:03:24.120> a<00:03:24.360> view

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
two black triangles and here's a a view

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.819 
two black triangles and here's a a view
of<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.260> diagram<00:03:26.120> so<00:03:27.120> now<00:03:27.209> we're<00:03:27.360> going<00:03:27.510> to

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
of the diagram so now we're going to

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.440 
of the diagram so now we're going to
start<00:03:28.829> on<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.040> next<00:03:29.099> two<00:03:29.489> sets<00:03:29.790> of<00:03:29.879> lines<00:03:30.150> you

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
start on the next two sets of lines you

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.940 
start on the next two sets of lines you
go<00:03:30.720> ahead<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:30.959> turn<00:03:31.079> your<00:03:31.140> ball<00:03:31.349> 90<00:03:31.620> degrees

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
go ahead and turn your ball 90 degrees

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.720 
go ahead and turn your ball 90 degrees
and<00:03:32.459> I'm<00:03:32.579> going<00:03:32.760> to<00:03:32.819> start<00:03:33.470> here<00:03:34.470> from<00:03:35.310> the

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
and I'm going to start here from the

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.600 
and I'm going to start here from the
equator<00:03:36.150> points<00:03:36.810> so<00:03:37.409> you<00:03:37.560> can<00:03:37.769> see<00:03:38.010> some

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
equator points so you can see some

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.479 
equator points so you can see some
people<00:03:38.730> may<00:03:39.569> feel<00:03:40.170> it's<00:03:40.410> easier<00:03:40.769> to<00:03:41.099> use<00:03:41.340> your

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
people may feel it's easier to use your

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.610 
people may feel it's easier to use your
Cueto<00:03:41.819> point<00:03:42.150> as<00:03:42.329> a<00:03:42.359> starting<00:03:42.840> point<00:03:43.049> instead

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
Cueto point as a starting point instead

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.410 
Cueto point as a starting point instead
of<00:03:43.739> one<00:03:43.950> of<00:03:44.010> those<00:03:44.099> north-south<00:03:44.670> points

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.150 

anyway<00:03:48.420> you're<00:03:49.410> just<00:03:49.440> going<00:03:49.739> to<00:03:49.769> do<00:03:49.890> the<00:03:50.010> same

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
anyway you're just going to do the same

00:03:50.160 --> 00:04:00.860 
anyway you're just going to do the same
as<00:03:50.280> you<00:03:50.370> did<00:03:50.459> before<00:03:50.579> connecting<00:03:51.269> the<00:03:51.390> dots

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.449 

all<00:04:01.870> right<00:04:02.019> so<00:04:02.200> we<00:04:02.349> finished<00:04:02.500> our<00:04:02.830> third<00:04:02.920> line

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
all right so we finished our third line

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.440 
all right so we finished our third line
and<00:04:05.310> now<00:04:06.310> it's<00:04:06.489> time<00:04:06.700> to<00:04:06.730> start<00:04:06.940> on<00:04:07.120> a<00:04:07.180> fourth

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
and now it's time to start on a fourth

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.430 
and now it's time to start on a fourth
line<00:04:08.489> all<00:04:09.489> right<00:04:09.549> so<00:04:10.420> go<00:04:10.659> ahead<00:04:10.840> and<00:04:10.989> from<00:04:11.349> the

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
line all right so go ahead and from the

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.280 
line all right so go ahead and from the
side<00:04:11.650> view<00:04:11.950> you<00:04:12.940> can<00:04:13.420> see<00:04:13.659> where<00:04:13.870> you<00:04:13.989> need<00:04:14.170> to

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
side view you can see where you need to

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.590 
side view you can see where you need to
start<00:04:14.349> you<00:04:15.190> need<00:04:15.370> to<00:04:15.459> criss<00:04:15.700> cross<00:04:15.970> your<00:04:16.239> third

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
start you need to criss cross your third

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:28.140 
start you need to criss cross your third
line<00:04:17.519> with<00:04:18.519> that<00:04:18.699> new<00:04:18.850> fourth<00:04:19.150> line

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.740 

all<00:04:29.020> right<00:04:29.229> so<00:04:29.500> now<00:04:29.770> you're<00:04:29.979> done<00:04:30.449> let's<00:04:31.449> go

all right so now you're done let's go
ahead<00:04:31.810> and<00:04:31.990> take<00:04:32.080> a<00:04:32.110> side<00:04:32.380> view<00:04:32.410> look<00:04:32.770> here<00:04:33.009> you

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
ahead and take a side view look here you

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.090 
ahead and take a side view look here you
can<00:04:33.729> see<00:04:33.970> the<00:04:34.210> the<00:04:34.810> alternating<00:04:35.380> colors<00:04:35.889> of

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
can see the the alternating colors of

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
can see the the alternating colors of
petals<00:04:36.430> or<00:04:36.669> triangles<00:04:38.759> alright<00:04:39.759> let's<00:04:39.940> take<00:04:40.060> a

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
petals or triangles alright let's take a

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.180 
petals or triangles alright let's take a
look<00:04:40.330> at<00:04:40.479> it<00:04:40.630> compared<00:04:41.110> to<00:04:41.320> our<00:04:41.560> diagram<00:04:42.160> that

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
look at it compared to our diagram that

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:43.379 
look at it compared to our diagram that
we<00:04:42.490> started<00:04:42.850> out<00:04:42.970> with

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
we started out with

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:45.870 
we started out with
there's<00:04:44.110> a<00:04:44.199> red<00:04:44.410> petal<00:04:44.740> and<00:04:44.919> there's<00:04:45.610> a<00:04:45.699> red

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
there's a red petal and there's a red

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.719 
there's a red petal and there's a red
petal<00:04:46.470> there's<00:04:47.470> a<00:04:47.620> black<00:04:48.220> petal<00:04:48.520> inner

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 
petal there's a black petal inner

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:51.150 
petal there's a black petal inner
diagram<00:04:49.150> and<00:04:49.930> there's<00:04:50.289> a<00:04:50.380> black<00:04:50.560> petal<00:04:50.889> on

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
diagram and there's a black petal on

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:57.330 
diagram and there's a black petal on
your<00:04:51.460> bowl<00:04:53.250> so<00:04:54.750> that's<00:04:55.750> pretty<00:04:56.380> much<00:04:56.560> it<00:04:57.039> I'm

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
your bowl so that's pretty much it I'm

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.999 
your bowl so that's pretty much it I'm
also<00:04:57.669> there's<00:04:58.360> this<00:04:58.740> you'll<00:04:59.740> see<00:04:59.770> this
