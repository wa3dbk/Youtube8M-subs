 What's aquarium people, fishtanktv.com, Dustins aquariums. Bring it to you on a Saturday afternoon. It is a beautiful day out. I don't know why I'm here. It is like the end of January and the beautiful out. So I go outside and take a walk with the girls, with May, May, who is on a varied nap schedule with the two year old, so you can imagine how that works. Anyway, I want to show you what's going on. I had a few people ask me about principle: dude, tell us some stories about how to get some of these tanks and kind of history behind them. So, I have a few tanks I want to talk about and we'll start with the 90-gallon. Please excuse the decor of the aquarium, or the lack thereof. I wanted to keep it that way I would just scape it myself and not sell any plants out of it, but it happens so any way. This class and tank I then got "Just Fish", the legendary and now extinct pet store here in Lexington had a yard sale in the summer. And my husband parker whom I have to get on film, the guy knows crazy things about fish, was there. He actually made this huge pile if the boss wasn't there, Tony for those of you who know him, and was just what you want to pay and I was guys with him so and of course I have a bit of an aquarium problem. I didn't really want to, but he is a human being what do you think of the 90s. I was a guy I can get started with that. I finally got the 90 loaded in the back of my wife's car and I got the 90's stand, a bunch of filter stuff, and just a bunch of miscellanies fish stuff that would only be cool to people with fish tanks. I have it all for, like $ 125 or something and then the tank was just in my garage for about ... two ... no, about a year. Just because I'm an opportunist when I see a good deal on something I'm probably snagging. So then it sat in my garage for about a year and then I brought it in and actually had it as a reef for a while, it was actually too long to have a reef though in my opinion. The lights could not go deep enough into it. That was in the reef days. So what I did was I switched it off, I got it in my old office ... some of you loyal watchers can see the old green thumb videos. I don't even know what songs we are talking as 100 series on my 29th birthday real old, 2 year old videos. I had this tank setup in the windshield of my old green thumb office and it was bold because it got daylight instantly and it had super amazing growth because I had a natural spectrum. I also had fluorescent on. It was tight and then I closed the green thumb office downstairs and brought it down here. But one of the things about this tank and it is my opinion is this difference between Americans and Europeans on this: is that I think the Americans have kind of like, it's more of a tank and just a tank. I think Europeans were a bit more like his furniture kind of style. From what I have collected. Yes Maya let me have your pacifier for you here you go. For me, I think this is a decent position. It is not ideal. And I know some of you have women or girlfriends and the need to get a nice piece of furniture. For me if you look at the position, I will do something wrong in the tank. So if you go down to my place and you are like the guy your stand has as paint chips on it or whatever I do is wrong in the tank. That's my opinion about it. So I actually hit it with a thin coat of paint, I actually think it has duckweed stuck in front of it. I really don't care, and I'm embarrassed to show you the nano that's underneath that behind that door over there. So you must be an opportunist you must look for things. And if you're lucky enough that I have some room to hang on a tank for a while. Another thing, another fish head, I think the boys name was Billy. He was really in breeding cichlids here in Lexington. And my boy Parker again that just bad news Parker. He was going to divorce as Billy's yo man he breaking down his tanks. This cat, let me tell you that he had these four 75s, two 125s. He probably had ten 75s, five 55s, a few 125s, and a bunch of 20s. He became breeding cichlids left and right. And he was getting divorced and as a yo man if you help Billy move he will hook you up. It was a bit of a power play I helped him move and I was like I give this and this for it and he was right if that was. So, I think it was more of a sort of sex holding these tanks in the hobby. He knew that I would do something with them. What is cool by the way I do like that. I was connected with this, the stands people keep asking me about. They are just 2x4 stands and actually when I double do this tank back here I go to a stand similar to do this and get the kind of rolls. I will not comment on the booth in too much detail, but it is actually a frame and it came black. I wish I could say I was handy enough to build one, I guess I just couldn't get the time. So yes I have both of these for if under $ 200 maybe $ 300 I don't know. But I have four 75's for less than $ 300 which I think is bold. And a bunch of filters, heaters, foam filters you name it I have a lot of things. So you just have to look out for some sort of offers and that's what I've done and I've been a scavenger. I don't think I bought a new tank because I was like real real real young. My first four foot tank was a 55, that was cracked and I fixed that, which was pretty baller. I have to see how you actually do that. So that's a bit of history on the tanks. And about the 220 I have the 220, which I am kidding I am not giving you the 220 at the moment. You will have to wait. I know some of you have asked about it. I am not with the 220 yet because I am working on it. I have to get it going. It is not worth the camera right now, but I am this tank. I noticed a few more babies here, which is fat. So uh yes, think this ocelot sword loves the new enlightenment. Watch her new growth pop up there. Same with the hygraphy drawer. So yes I have a good time. That is it.
