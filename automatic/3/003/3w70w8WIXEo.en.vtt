there and these are all natural spawning

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.000 
there and these are all natural spawning
so<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.280> do<00:00:53.339> not<00:00:53.519> place<00:00:53.819> these<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.649> so<00:00:55.649> on<00:00:55.800> so

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
so I do not place these and so on so

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.669 
so I do not place these and so on so
it's<00:00:56.190> pretty<00:00:56.399> cool<00:00:56.579> like<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:56.789> now<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:58.170> says

00:00:58.669 --> 00:00:58.679 
it's pretty cool like that now it says

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:00.379 
it's pretty cool like that now it says
that<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.069> watermelon<00:00:59.639> spawning<00:00:59.879> is<00:01:00.059> pretty

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:00.389 
that the watermelon spawning is pretty

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:02.419 
that the watermelon spawning is pretty
rare<00:01:00.629> but<00:01:00.989> what<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:01.199> see<00:01:01.499> is<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.829> it's<00:01:02.069> not<00:01:02.190> too

00:01:02.419 --> 00:01:02.429 
rare but what I see is that it's not too

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:03.889 
rare but what I see is that it's not too
bad<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.819> if<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.449> can<00:01:03.569> actually<00:01:03.839> adjust

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
bad and if you you can actually adjust

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.990 
bad and if you you can actually adjust
how<00:01:04.290> much<00:01:04.320> they<00:01:04.920> spawn<00:01:05.159> in<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.370> config<00:01:05.729> files

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
how much they spawn in the config files

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.450 
how much they spawn in the config files
but<00:01:06.360> I'd<00:01:06.899> leave<00:01:07.259> it<00:01:07.380> alone<00:01:07.500> because<00:01:07.950> it's<00:01:08.189> not

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
but I'd leave it alone because it's not

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.780 
but I'd leave it alone because it's not
that<00:01:08.520> rare<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.479> be<00:01:09.619> you<00:01:10.619> can<00:01:10.770> see<00:01:10.920> there<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:11.219> find

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
that rare to be you can see there I find

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.120 
that rare to be you can see there I find
there<00:01:12.149> there's<00:01:12.479> patches<00:01:12.960> there<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.409> there<00:01:13.590> so

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
there there's patches there and there so

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.749 
there there's patches there and there so
that's<00:01:14.250> pretty<00:01:14.640> darn<00:01:14.850> cool<00:01:16.189> so<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.310> next<00:01:17.490> mod

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
that's pretty darn cool so the next mod

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.910 
that's pretty darn cool so the next mod
is<00:01:17.969> the<00:01:18.149> Apple<00:01:18.600> gin<00:01:18.899> and<00:01:19.140> what<00:01:19.469> it<00:01:19.590> allows<00:01:19.680> you

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
is the Apple gin and what it allows you

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.160 
is the Apple gin and what it allows you
to<00:01:20.039> do<00:01:20.219> is<00:01:20.369> have<00:01:20.549> apples<00:01:21.060> randomly<00:01:21.689> generate

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
to do is have apples randomly generate

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.980 
to do is have apples randomly generate
on<00:01:22.350> trees<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.549> like<00:01:23.759> this<00:01:23.909> oak<00:01:24.119> tree<00:01:24.539> this

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
on trees so like this oak tree this

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.469 
on trees so like this oak tree this
apple<00:01:25.409> will<00:01:25.560> generate<00:01:25.950> here<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.579> you<00:01:27.329> can

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
apple will generate here and you can

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.450 
apple will generate here and you can
break<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.049> punch<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:29.009> get<00:01:29.250> back

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
break it and punch it and you get back

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.120 
break it and punch it and you get back
in<00:01:29.670> Apple<00:01:30.240> now<00:01:30.869> over<00:01:31.170> here<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.500> can<00:01:31.619> see<00:01:31.829> here

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
in Apple now over here you can see here

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.670 
in Apple now over here you can see here
is<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:33.079> regular<00:01:34.079> apple<00:01:34.229> it's<00:01:34.469> kind<00:01:34.649> of

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
is a regular apple it's kind of

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.800 
is a regular apple it's kind of
yellowish<00:01:35.039> and<00:01:35.219> this<00:01:35.549> is<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.939> default<00:01:36.240> stage

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
yellowish and this is the default stage

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.810 
yellowish and this is the default stage
so<00:01:37.409> this<00:01:37.590> allows<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.039> actually<00:01:38.159> farm<00:01:38.609> your

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
so this allows you to actually farm your

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.330 
so this allows you to actually farm your
apples<00:01:39.329> rather<00:01:39.990> than<00:01:40.229> breaking<00:01:40.680> your<00:01:41.039> leaves

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
apples rather than breaking your leaves

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.130 
apples rather than breaking your leaves
and<00:01:41.549> getting<00:01:41.759> them<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.359> if<00:01:42.420> we<00:01:42.509> break<00:01:42.719> an<00:01:42.869> apple

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
and getting them so if we break an apple

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.419 
and getting them so if we break an apple
in<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.259> first<00:01:43.500> stage<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.920> will<00:01:43.979> give<00:01:44.100> us<00:01:44.130> back

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:44.429 
in the first stage it will give us back

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:46.399 
in the first stage it will give us back
apple<00:01:44.939> seeds<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.450> apple<00:01:46.020> seeds<00:01:46.229> can<00:01:46.380> be

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
apple seeds and apple seeds can be

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.249 
apple seeds and apple seeds can be
planted<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:48.000> will<00:01:48.210> grow<00:01:48.420> over<00:01:48.450> time<00:01:48.750> now

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
planted and it will grow over time now

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.779 
planted and it will grow over time now
to<00:01:49.320> get<00:01:49.500> apple<00:01:49.829> seeds<00:01:49.979> from<00:01:50.070> regular<00:01:50.549> apple

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
to get apple seeds from regular apple

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:52.609 
to get apple seeds from regular apple

get to apple seeds and you can plant

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.130 
get to apple seeds and you can plant
them<00:01:55.109> and<00:01:55.789> this<00:01:56.789> mod<00:01:57.000> did<00:01:57.299> remove<00:01:57.659> though

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
them and this mod did remove though

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.550 
them and this mod did remove though
being<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.979> ability<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.520> break<00:01:59.990> leaves<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.320> oak

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
being the ability to break leaves of oak

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.760 
being the ability to break leaves of oak
trees<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.189> get<00:02:02.369> apples<00:02:03.119> because<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:04.200> mean<00:02:04.439> these

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
trees to get apples because I mean these

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.200 
trees to get apples because I mean these
are<00:02:04.950> now<00:02:05.070> spawning<00:02:05.520> randomly<00:02:06.060> and

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
are now spawning randomly and

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.180 
are now spawning randomly and
automatically<00:02:06.929> so<00:02:07.499> you<00:02:07.530> can<00:02:07.859> see<00:02:07.979> we<00:02:08.070> got

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
automatically so you can see we got

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.969 
automatically so you can see we got
another<00:02:08.460> tree<00:02:08.789> down<00:02:08.970> here<00:02:09.500> spawning<00:02:10.500> these<00:02:10.769> as

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
another tree down here spawning these as

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.500 
another tree down here spawning these as
well<00:02:11.159> and<00:02:11.430> growing<00:02:11.760> them<00:02:11.909> so

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
well and growing them so

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.089 
well and growing them so
so<00:02:12.599> we<00:02:12.659> have<00:02:12.780> another<00:02:12.930> broken<00:02:13.379> and<00:02:13.620> ready<00:02:13.830> one

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
so we have another broken and ready one

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.250 
so we have another broken and ready one
there<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.909> eat<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.299> because<00:02:15.390> it's<00:02:15.629> fresh<00:02:15.959> and

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
there and eat it because it's fresh and

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.610 
there and eat it because it's fresh and
that<00:02:16.829> is<00:02:17.129> the<00:02:17.519> Apple<00:02:17.939> gen<00:02:18.299> the<00:02:18.959> next<00:02:19.230> part<00:02:19.439> is

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
that is the Apple gen the next part is

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.520 
that is the Apple gen the next part is
the<00:02:19.920> flower<00:02:20.280> propagation<00:02:21.239> mod<00:02:21.659> and<00:02:22.019> it

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
the flower propagation mod and it

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.369 
the flower propagation mod and it
randomly<00:02:22.890> generates<00:02:23.689> flowers<00:02:24.689> or<00:02:24.870> roses

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
randomly generates flowers or roses

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.259 
randomly generates flowers or roses
throughout<00:02:25.860> your<00:02:26.069> world<00:02:26.340> so<00:02:27.000> instead<00:02:27.180> of

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
throughout your world so instead of

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.509 
throughout your world so instead of
having<00:02:27.450> your<00:02:27.629> roses<00:02:28.079> generate<00:02:28.860> how<00:02:29.159> they<00:02:29.370> are

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
having your roses generate how they are

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.569 
having your roses generate how they are
over<00:02:29.790> here<00:02:30.150> you<00:02:30.750> get<00:02:30.989> flower<00:02:31.470> beds<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.220> rose

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
over here you get flower beds and rose

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.780 
over here you get flower beds and rose
beds<00:02:32.819> like<00:02:33.269> how<00:02:33.480> it<00:02:33.599> is<00:02:33.690> up<00:02:33.900> here<00:02:34.069> so<00:02:35.069> it<00:02:35.370> when

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
beds like how it is up here so it when

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.220 
beds like how it is up here so it when
you<00:02:35.909> get<00:02:36.060> them<00:02:36.239> here<00:02:36.450> you<00:02:36.510> can<00:02:36.690> break<00:02:36.930> it<00:02:36.959> and

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
you get them here you can break it and

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.149 
you get them here you can break it and
you<00:02:37.860> get<00:02:38.220> four<00:02:38.879> roses<00:02:39.180> back<00:02:39.629> and<00:02:39.930> then<00:02:40.799> you<00:02:40.980> get

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
you get four roses back and then you get

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.059 
you get four roses back and then you get
a<00:02:41.340> chance<00:02:41.790> from<00:02:42.060> getting<00:02:42.480> one<00:02:42.780> two<00:02:43.319> three

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
a chance from getting one two three

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.250 
a chance from getting one two three
seeds<00:02:44.430> then<00:02:45.060> you<00:02:45.120> can<00:02:45.269> replant<00:02:45.659> these<00:02:45.930> and

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
seeds then you can replant these and

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.140 
seeds then you can replant these and
they<00:02:46.500> will<00:02:46.650> grow<00:02:46.799> back<00:02:47.010> up<00:02:47.280> so<00:02:47.909> you<00:02:48.000> guys

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
they will grow back up so you guys

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.729 
they will grow back up so you guys
considered<00:02:48.659> another<00:02:48.870> one<00:02:49.109> here<00:02:49.409> and<00:02:49.560> we<00:02:49.620> can

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
considered another one here and we can

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.649 
considered another one here and we can
break<00:02:49.920> that<00:02:50.099> there<00:02:50.400> and<00:02:50.670> we<00:02:50.730> got<00:02:50.909> one<00:02:51.389> seed

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
break that there and we got one seed

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:53.960 
break that there and we got one seed
there<00:02:51.930> and<00:02:52.200> you<00:02:52.859> can<00:02:53.040> grow<00:02:53.280> them<00:02:53.310> up<00:02:53.609> now<00:02:53.819> they

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
there and you can grow them up now they

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.809 
there and you can grow them up now they
randomly<00:02:54.510> generate<00:02:54.959> around<00:02:55.049> your<00:02:55.319> world<00:02:55.500> on

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
gain XP for using these just like you

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.640 
gain XP for using these just like you
would<00:03:58.590> when<00:03:58.919> using<00:03:59.519> a<00:03:59.609> fishing<00:03:59.970> pole

would when using a fishing pole

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.580 
would when using a fishing pole
but<00:04:01.340> it<00:04:01.459> is<00:04:01.610> an<00:04:01.909> advantage<00:04:02.510> in<00:04:02.689> a<00:04:02.840> way<00:04:03.019> that<00:04:03.349> you

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
but it is an advantage in a way that you

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.130 
but it is an advantage in a way that you
can<00:04:03.709> mask<00:04:04.159> collect<00:04:04.610> fish<00:04:05.030> and<00:04:05.360> not<00:04:05.629> have<00:04:05.900> to

they're<00:04:33.830> not<00:04:33.979> greatly<00:04:34.460> placed<00:04:34.820> maybe<00:04:35.120> this

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
they're not greatly placed maybe this

they're not greatly placed maybe this
one<00:04:35.510> here's<00:04:35.720> a<00:04:35.780> little<00:04:35.990> better<00:04:36.110> place<00:04:36.380> but

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 
one here's a little better place but

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:38.170 
one here's a little better place but
what<00:04:37.160> you<00:04:37.280> want<00:04:37.490> to<00:04:37.550> do<00:04:37.699> is<00:04:37.820> have<00:04:37.940> something

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
what you want to do is have something

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.719 
what you want to do is have something
like<00:04:38.419> that<00:04:38.449> they're<00:04:39.080> over<00:04:39.380> here<00:04:39.860> and<00:04:40.130> have

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:40.729 
like that they're over here and have

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:43.240 
like that they're over here and have
more<00:04:41.060> bigger<00:04:41.389> ones<00:04:41.750> throughout<00:04:42.440> the<00:04:42.919> kind<00:04:43.160> of

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
more bigger ones throughout the kind of

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.550 
more bigger ones throughout the kind of
look<00:04:43.520> uniform<00:04:44.030> and<00:04:44.539> their<00:04:44.720> spawning<00:04:45.020> too

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
look uniform and their spawning too

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.879 
look uniform and their spawning too
close<00:04:46.070> to<00:04:46.250> each<00:04:46.280> other<00:04:46.520> but<00:04:47.510> and<00:04:47.930> also<00:04:48.710> their

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 
close to each other but and also their

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:50.529 
close to each other but and also their
spawning<00:04:49.130> on<00:04:49.400> edges<00:04:49.940> like<00:04:50.150> that<00:04:50.300> so<00:04:50.449> it

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:50.539 
spawning on edges like that so it

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:52.930 
spawning on edges like that so it
doesn't<00:04:50.780> look<00:04:50.990> right<00:04:51.260> but<00:04:51.830> it's<00:04:52.430> pretty<00:04:52.729> cool

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
doesn't look right but it's pretty cool

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.000 
doesn't look right but it's pretty cool
other<00:04:53.240> than<00:04:53.449> that<00:04:53.510> I<00:04:53.960> like<00:04:54.199> the<00:04:54.229> idea<00:04:54.470> it's<00:04:54.919> a

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
other than that I like the idea it's a

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.520 
other than that I like the idea it's a
great<00:04:55.220> concept<00:04:55.460> it's<00:04:55.970> not<00:04:56.240> super<00:04:57.050> well<00:04:57.199> done

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
great concept it's not super well done

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.379 
great concept it's not super well done
or<00:04:58.160> it's<00:04:58.430> not<00:04:58.550> that<00:04:58.699> it's<00:04:58.820> not<00:04:58.940> super<00:04:59.270> well

00:04:59.379 --> 00:04:59.389 
or it's not that it's not super well

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:01.689 
or it's not that it's not super well
done<00:04:59.599> it's<00:04:59.780> not<00:04:59.930> that<00:05:00.139> it<00:05:00.289> was<00:05:00.500> it's<00:05:01.190> a<00:05:01.310> new<00:05:01.460> mod

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:01.699 
done it's not that it was it's a new mod

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:03.070 
done it's not that it was it's a new mod
so<00:05:01.940> it's<00:05:02.090> still<00:05:02.270> in<00:05:02.389> beta<00:05:02.570> it's<00:05:02.810> a<00:05:02.840> first

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
so it's still in beta it's a first

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.300 
so it's still in beta it's a first
version<00:05:03.259> but<00:05:03.740> it<00:05:04.070> needs<00:05:04.610> to<00:05:04.910> be<00:05:05.060> fixed<00:05:05.599> up<00:05:05.690> and

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
version but it needs to be fixed up and

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.700

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
needs to have its abilities and more

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.969 
needs to have its abilities and more
generations<00:05:10.370> to<00:05:10.940> be<00:05:11.060> added<00:05:11.449> but<00:05:12.320> anyway<00:05:12.830> guys
