00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.120 

well<00:00:19.450> to<00:00:19.690> be<00:00:19.780> honest<00:00:20.080> I<00:00:20.170> think<00:00:20.380> it's<00:00:20.500> a<00:00:20.619> little

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.130 
well to be honest I think it's a little

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.609 
well to be honest I think it's a little
bit<00:00:21.250> silly<00:00:21.960> given<00:00:22.960> that<00:00:23.110> we're<00:00:23.230> in<00:00:23.350> the<00:00:23.529> year

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:23.619 
bit silly given that we're in the year

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:29.010 
bit silly given that we're in the year
2008<00:00:24.369> but<00:00:25.090> I<00:00:26.400> guess<00:00:27.400> it<00:00:27.550> makes<00:00:27.730> sense<00:00:28.020> the

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.020 
2008 but I guess it makes sense the

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.960 
2008 but I guess it makes sense the
thing<00:00:29.230> that<00:00:29.349> I<00:00:29.380> can<00:00:29.919> say<00:00:30.070> about<00:00:30.099> it<00:00:30.369> is<00:00:30.640> the

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 
thing that I can say about it is the

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.730 
thing that I can say about it is the
movie<00:00:31.240> is<00:00:31.329> so<00:00:31.509> much<00:00:31.660> more<00:00:31.840> than<00:00:32.020> that

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:32.740 
movie is so much more than that

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.310 
movie is so much more than that
it's<00:00:33.160> kind<00:00:33.400> of<00:00:33.490> a<00:00:33.670> I<00:00:34.510> guess<00:00:35.020> it's<00:00:35.170> more

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
it's kind of a I guess it's more

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.110 
it's kind of a I guess it's more
shocking<00:00:35.350> than<00:00:35.920> then<00:00:36.190> then<00:00:36.579> maybe<00:00:36.880> I<00:00:36.970> would

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
shocking than then then maybe I would

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.500 
shocking than then then maybe I would
have<00:00:37.150> thought<00:00:37.420> I<00:00:37.480> mean<00:00:37.720> I<00:00:37.810> you<00:00:38.350> know<00:00:39.510> it's

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
have thought I mean I you know it's

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.569 
have thought I mean I you know it's
probably<00:00:40.690> the<00:00:41.079> only<00:00:41.200> I<00:00:41.560> guess<00:00:41.890> probably<00:00:42.370> the

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
probably the only I guess probably the

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:44.490 
probably the only I guess probably the
only<00:00:42.730> film<00:00:42.940> that's<00:00:43.060> ever<00:00:43.210> had<00:00:43.570> that<00:00:43.720> word<00:00:44.350> in

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
only film that's ever had that word in

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.220 
only film that's ever had that word in
the<00:00:44.590> title<00:00:44.739> so<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:46.570> know<00:00:46.809> we're<00:00:47.109> breaking

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
the title so you know we're breaking

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.900 
the title so you know we're breaking
barriers<00:00:47.590> you<00:00:48.010> know<00:00:48.190> breaking<00:00:48.730> cultural

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
barriers you know breaking cultural

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.750 
barriers you know breaking cultural
barriers<00:00:49.510> here<00:00:49.750> maybe<00:00:49.930> as<00:00:50.170> well<00:00:50.710> as<00:00:50.949> having<00:00:51.640> a

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
barriers here maybe as well as having a

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.310 
barriers here maybe as well as having a
great<00:00:51.910> film<00:00:52.149> out<00:00:52.269> there<00:00:52.300> but<00:00:52.629> the<00:00:52.989> movie<00:00:53.260> is

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
great film out there but the movie is

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.950 
great film out there but the movie is
really<00:00:53.379> about<00:00:54.160> Zach<00:00:54.430> and<00:00:54.609> Mary<00:00:54.820> and<00:00:55.120> it's<00:00:55.899> a

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
really about Zach and Mary and it's a

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.540 
really about Zach and Mary and it's a
great<00:00:56.140> love<00:00:56.350> story<00:00:56.590> that<00:00:56.620> develops<00:00:57.160> and<00:00:57.460> is

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
great love story that develops and is

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.639 
great love story that develops and is
played<00:00:57.850> out<00:00:57.879> in<00:00:58.210> the<00:00:58.660> film<00:00:58.840> so<00:00:59.109> I<00:00:59.289> think<00:00:59.500> people

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
played out in the film so I think people

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.990 
played out in the film so I think people
will<00:00:59.829> be<00:01:00.660> surprised<00:01:01.660> by<00:01:01.949> by<00:01:02.949> by<00:01:03.550> that<00:01:03.579> aspect

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
will be surprised by by by that aspect

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.780 
will be surprised by by by that aspect
of<00:01:04.150> the<00:01:04.239> film<00:01:04.449> so<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:06.040> so<00:01:06.430> therefore<00:01:06.700> it

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
of the film so that so therefore it

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:07.710 
of the film so that so therefore it
doesn't<00:01:06.970> bother<00:01:07.060> me<00:01:07.240> because<00:01:07.300> I<00:01:07.480> know<00:01:07.510> the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
doesn't bother me because I know the

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:15.770 
doesn't bother me because I know the
film<00:01:08.290> is<00:01:08.380> really<00:01:08.470> good

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:23.660 

right<00:01:17.600> right<00:01:21.260> well<00:01:22.260> well<00:01:23.130> that's<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.430> that's<00:01:23.520> a

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
right right well well that's it that's a

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.100 
right right well well that's it that's a
good<00:01:23.820> question<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.450> know<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:24.780> don't<00:01:24.960> have

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
good question you know I don't have

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.270 
good question you know I don't have
children<00:01:25.320> yet<00:01:25.700> but<00:01:26.780> you<00:01:27.780> know<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:27.930> think<00:01:28.740> that

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
children yet but you know I think that

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.920 
children yet but you know I think that
sex<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.840> thing<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.800> is<00:01:32.330> not<00:01:33.330> talked<00:01:33.750> about

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
sex is a thing that is not talked about

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.620 
sex is a thing that is not talked about
this<00:01:34.530> in<00:01:34.830> this<00:01:35.070> country<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.700> maybe<00:01:36.150> that's<00:01:36.390> a

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
this in this country and maybe that's a

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.010 
this in this country and maybe that's a
problem<00:01:37.520> we<00:01:38.520> wait<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.060> we<00:01:39.090> wait<00:01:39.420> for<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.869> long

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
problem we wait and we wait for a long

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.320 
problem we wait and we wait for a long
time<00:01:40.260> and<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:41.400> I'm<00:01:41.820> not<00:01:42.000> sure<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.210> that's

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
time and and I'm not sure that that's

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.390 
time and and I'm not sure that that's
that's<00:01:42.840> that's<00:01:43.140> good<00:01:43.410> not<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.890> say<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.130> kids

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
that's that's good not to say that kids

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.620 
that's that's good not to say that kids
should<00:01:44.550> be<00:01:44.640> watching<00:01:44.850> any<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.330> but<00:01:45.510> to

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
should be watching any of that but to

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.960 
should be watching any of that but to
know<00:01:45.810> what<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.260> I<00:01:46.770> don't<00:01:47.610> think<00:01:47.790> is

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
know what it is I don't think is

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.760 
know what it is I don't think is
necessarily<00:01:48.660> a<00:01:48.750> bad<00:01:48.840> thing<00:01:48.930> at<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.290> certain<00:01:49.680> age

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
necessarily a bad thing at a certain age

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.160 
necessarily a bad thing at a certain age
you<00:01:50.759> know<00:01:51.920> kids<00:01:52.920> are<00:01:53.070> curious<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.960> they<00:01:54.960> want

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
you know kids are curious and they want

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.900 
you know kids are curious and they want
to<00:01:55.259> know<00:01:55.350> things<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.830> you<00:01:56.399> know<00:01:56.520> knowledge<00:01:56.729> is

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
to know things and you know knowledge is

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:02.180 
to know things and you know knowledge is
power<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:58.759> think<00:01:59.930> yeah<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:01.170> can't<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:01.770> can't<00:02:02.039> I

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
power so I think yeah I can't I can't I

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.389 
power so I think yeah I can't I can't I
can't<00:02:02.220> I<00:02:02.640> can't<00:02:03.060> say<00:02:03.660> not<00:02:04.440> not<00:02:04.710> not<00:02:04.950> having<00:02:05.250> a

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
can't I can't say not not not having a

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.820 
can't I can't say not not not having a
children<00:02:05.970> at<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:06.119> point<00:02:06.360> but<00:02:06.570> I<00:02:06.869> think<00:02:07.410> I

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
children at this point but I think I

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.370 
children at this point but I think I
think<00:02:08.039> there's<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.250> can<00:02:08.610> maybe<00:02:09.360> we<00:02:10.110> need<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.289> be

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
think there's a can maybe we need to be

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.540 
think there's a can maybe we need to be
a<00:02:10.410> little<00:02:10.530> more<00:02:10.800> relaxed<00:02:11.100> about<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.459> whole

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
a little more relaxed about the whole

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:18.410 
a little more relaxed about the whole
situation
