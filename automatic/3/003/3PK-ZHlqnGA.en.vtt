00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.760
 but 

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:06.330
 after 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.829
 hello to all the transcend readers 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.340
 magazine welcome to the second 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:30.779
 appointment on this video that 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.420
 will treat two of the styles that are 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.760
 direct consequence of hip hop that 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.550
 we treated you last time 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.830
 they are the go go and new jazz swing 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.150
 for this appointment I thought of 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:47.010
 create a groove that can be in 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.440
 some way a warm up for you then 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.070
 before starting to study the 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.780
 material related to the article precisely 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.489
 on google new jazz swing and you can 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.010
 use this groove for 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.260
 focus on the main elements e 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.640
 fundamentals concerning these two 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.939
 styles the groove that I created yes 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.259
 develops on two beats and provides for 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:15.420
 somehow the use of all those 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.350
 of those traits that are typical of the two 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.170
 genres 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.180
 we are therefore talking about in flight phil 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.940
 then a deed swing deportment 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.270
 16th we are talking about for that 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.950
 which concerns the place a box 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.780
 syncopated and we're talking instead for 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:36.060
 what concerns the know jack swing of 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:38.510
 using digos notes the exercise that 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.680
 you will then see the groove that you will see 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:45.190
 in overlay it is also divided into 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.570
 so the first measure is schematic 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.820
 takes the elements into consideration 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.760
 main go go then cash 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.470
 syncopated and charleston mind opening 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.120
 instead the second part is concentrated 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.850
 on the fundamental elements of the investigating judge 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.940
 swing therefore just the notes I read 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.250
 be very careful then to keep 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.430
 a bearing on a cat in both 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:11.350
 jokes and to make the difference 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:14.510
 dynamic between back beat and ghost nueter 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:20.480
 I will make the first exercise feel first a 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:21.920
 80 bpm and then at 92 bpm that is 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.290
 a speed that very often yes 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.890
 finds within the songs go go and 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.980
 new jazz swing or armed a base 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.810
 which also in this case does 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.550
 better perceive the swinging posture 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.450
 so you can do it too 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:40.130
 programming a simple base too 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.580
 with percussion and bass like this one 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:46.280
 case that can help you develop 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.959
 better this bearing 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.400
 I repeat you can use this 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.770
 group at the beginning of your sessions 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.480
 of study and just to enter 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.280
 mostly within the 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.959
 sound and bearing characteristics 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.959
 of these two styles, good vision
