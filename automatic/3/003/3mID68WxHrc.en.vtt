lithium ion 3050 milliamp hour battery
which<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.250> kind<00:01:59.579> of<00:01:59.640> thought<00:01:59.820> was<00:02:00.630> not<00:02:01.200> enough

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
which I kind of thought was not enough

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.310 
which I kind of thought was not enough
for<00:02:01.619> this<00:02:01.740> device<00:02:01.979> launched<00:02:02.460> but<00:02:02.759> then<00:02:03.060> again

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
for this device launched but then again

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.020 
for this device launched but then again
you<00:02:04.320> have<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.590> look<00:02:04.740> at<00:02:04.890> how<00:02:05.009> thin<00:02:05.430> this<00:02:05.670> device

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
you have to look at how thin this device

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.059 
you have to look at how thin this device
is<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.299> mean<00:02:06.540> just<00:02:06.840> quick<00:02:06.990> comparison<00:02:07.530> when<00:02:07.979> you

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
is I mean just quick comparison when you

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.770 
is I mean just quick comparison when you

eight megapixel illuminated sensor which
kind<00:02:17.380> of<00:02:17.440> sucked<00:02:17.800> but<00:02:18.550> that's<00:02:18.730> okay<00:02:19.060> because

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
kind of sucked but that's okay because

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.970 
kind of sucked but that's okay because
we<00:02:19.450> actually<00:02:19.900> have<00:02:20.140> a<00:02:20.200> case<00:02:20.410> that<00:02:20.440> will<00:02:20.770> slap

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
we actually have a case that will slap

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.949 
we actually have a case that will slap
onto<00:02:21.310> this<00:02:21.430> where<00:02:21.550> we<00:02:21.640> can<00:02:21.670> snap<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.240> qx10

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959

onto this where we can snap the qx10
which<00:02:23.200> is<00:02:23.380> right<00:02:23.770> here<00:02:24.090> right<00:02:25.200> onto<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.290> back

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
which is right here right onto the back

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.780 
which is right here right onto the back
of<00:02:26.470> it<00:02:26.709> then<00:02:26.890> that<00:02:26.920> kind<00:02:27.220> of<00:02:27.250> pretty<00:02:27.610> much

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790
