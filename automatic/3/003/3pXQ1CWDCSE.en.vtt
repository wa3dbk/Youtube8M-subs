00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
game and basically I'm gonna test out on

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.120 
game and basically I'm gonna test out on
my<00:00:10.110> iPad<00:00:10.740> too<00:00:12.469> just<00:00:13.469> to<00:00:13.559> see<00:00:13.769> what<00:00:13.920> it<00:00:13.980> looks

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
my iPad too just to see what it looks

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.910 
my iPad too just to see what it looks
like<00:00:14.219> quality<00:00:15.120> wise<00:00:15.420> when<00:00:15.870> you<00:00:16.020> blow<00:00:16.560> up<00:00:16.740> two

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
like quality wise when you blow up two

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.790 
like quality wise when you blow up two
teams<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.369> mode<00:00:18.260> so<00:00:19.260> far<00:00:19.500> it's<00:00:19.619> quite

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
teams to mode so far it's quite

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.500 
teams to mode so far it's quite
pixelated<00:00:22.010> but<00:00:23.010> it's<00:00:23.910> something<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.330> could

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
pixelated but it's something I could

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.220 
pixelated but it's something I could
probably<00:00:24.750> live<00:00:25.109> with<00:00:26.240> no<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:27.480> I<00:00:27.510> want<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.019> test

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
probably live with no so I want to test

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.659 
probably live with no so I want to test
out<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.560> control<00:00:29.070> system<00:00:29.519> see<00:00:29.730> let's<00:00:31.520> see<00:00:32.520> how

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
out the control system see let's see how

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.709 
out the control system see let's see how
good<00:00:32.700> it<00:00:32.969> is<00:00:34.399> this<00:00:35.399> sometimes<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:36.059> knife<00:00:36.390> win

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
good it is this sometimes a knife win

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.049 
good it is this sometimes a knife win
games<00:00:36.960> tend<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:38.090> clutter<00:00:39.090> too<00:00:39.600> much

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
games tend to clutter too much

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:50.150 
games tend to clutter too much
so<00:00:42.079> so<00:00:43.079> far<00:00:43.350> text<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.100> legible<00:00:48.890> okay<00:00:49.890> it's<00:00:50.100> a

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
so so far text is legible okay it's a

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:57.729 
so so far text is legible okay it's a
little<00:00:50.340> bit<00:00:50.460> soft<00:00:50.940> around<00:00:51.239> there<00:00:51.510> chance<00:00:51.809> I

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.189 

think<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.859> can<00:00:59.010> live<00:00:59.250> with<00:00:59.430> that

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
think I can live with that

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.290 
think I can live with that
now<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.530> mean<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:01.829> played<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:02.070> few<00:01:02.160> iPhone<00:01:03.059> games

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
now I mean I played a few iPhone games

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.410 
now I mean I played a few iPhone games
on<00:01:03.510> here<00:01:03.719> anyway<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:06.409> no<00:01:07.409> it's<00:01:07.650> quite<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.420> hefty

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
on here anyway so no it's quite a hefty

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.170 
on here anyway so no it's quite a hefty
layout<00:01:09.900> at<00:01:10.140> 6<00:01:10.619> pounds<00:01:10.799> ninety-nine<00:01:14.060> so<00:01:15.060> I'm

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
layout at 6 pounds ninety-nine so I'm

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.210 
layout at 6 pounds ninety-nine so I'm
sure<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.630> people<00:01:16.320> want<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.770> know<00:01:16.830> what<00:01:17.159> it

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.679 
sure you people want to know what it
looks<00:01:17.280> like<00:01:17.549> before<00:01:17.759> they<00:01:18.030> in<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.299> shell<00:01:18.570> like

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
looks like before they in the shell like

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:26.250 
looks like before they in the shell like
that<00:01:18.869> sort<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.140> money

and<00:01:47.240> one<00:01:47.810> one<00:01:48.050> things<00:01:48.350> I<00:01:48.470> noticed<00:01:48.830> was<00:01:48.920> the

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
and one one things I noticed was the

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.740 
and one one things I noticed was the
control<00:01:49.550> systems<00:01:49.940> quite<00:01:50.180> nice<00:01:51.040> where<00:01:52.510> you<00:01:53.510> can

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
control systems quite nice where you can

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.800 
control systems quite nice where you can
live<00:01:54.110> here<00:01:54.860> or<00:01:55.190> if<00:01:55.400> you're<00:01:55.580> left-handed<00:01:56.060> or

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
live here or if you're left-handed or

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.330 
live here or if you're left-handed or
right-handed<00:01:58.060> you<00:01:59.060> can<00:01:59.830> choose<00:02:00.830> which<00:02:01.070> site

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
right-handed you can choose which site

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:11.500 
right-handed you can choose which site
to<00:02:01.520> move<00:02:01.700> from<00:02:09.670> okay<00:02:10.670> as<00:02:11.000> you<00:02:11.090> can<00:02:11.210> see<00:02:11.390> the

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
to move from okay as you can see the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.700 
to move from okay as you can see the
text<00:02:11.810> is<00:02:11.930> a<00:02:12.760> definite<00:02:13.760> legible<00:02:14.330> menu<00:02:15.290> system

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
text is a definite legible menu system

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:26.929 
text is a definite legible menu system
is<00:02:15.920> fairly<00:02:16.310> clean

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:26.939 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:32.190 

sitting<00:02:27.939> inside

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.070 

so<00:02:33.220> seems<00:02:34.220> like<00:02:34.280> tapping<00:02:35.000> so<00:02:35.599> far

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
so seems like tapping so far

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.869 
so seems like tapping so far
I<00:02:36.110> mean<00:02:36.379> I've<00:02:36.470> now<00:02:36.590> got<00:02:36.800> that<00:02:36.950> far<00:02:37.190> in<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:37.730> game

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
I mean I've now got that far in the game

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.150 
I mean I've now got that far in the game
this<00:02:38.540> is<00:02:38.750> probably<00:02:39.170> as<00:02:39.260> far<00:02:39.290> as<00:02:39.560> I've<00:02:39.709> been<00:02:39.739> so

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
this is probably as far as I've been so

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.140 
this is probably as far as I've been so
um<00:02:41.150> I<00:02:42.250> don't<00:02:43.250> really<00:02:43.519> know<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.849> full<00:02:44.120> extent

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
um I don't really know the full extent

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.270 
um I don't really know the full extent
of<00:02:44.569> the<00:02:44.629> controls<00:02:45.050> if<00:02:45.290> there's<00:02:45.530> like<00:02:45.800> extra

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
of the controls if there's like extra

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:55.120 
of the controls if there's like extra
buttons<00:02:46.640> like<00:02:46.879> humid<00:02:47.569> Enya<00:02:49.569> new<00:02:50.569> consoles<00:02:54.130> go

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
buttons like humid Enya new consoles go

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.210 
buttons like humid Enya new consoles go
the<00:02:55.190> iPhone<00:02:55.880> mode<00:02:56.150> I<00:02:56.450> suppose<00:02:56.959> it<00:02:57.739> doesn't<00:02:57.980> I

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
the iPhone mode I suppose it doesn't I

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.820 
the iPhone mode I suppose it doesn't I
should<00:02:58.430> take<00:02:58.580> up<00:02:58.760> too<00:02:58.970> much<00:02:59.000> real<00:02:59.330> estate

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
should take up too much real estate

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.309 
should take up too much real estate
which<00:03:00.830> isn't<00:03:01.010> too<00:03:01.340> bad<00:03:01.870> so<00:03:02.870> you<00:03:03.019> had<00:03:03.170> your
