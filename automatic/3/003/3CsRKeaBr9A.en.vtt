better<00:00:52.309> in<00:00:52.909> fact<00:00:53.089> that's<00:00:53.390> our<00:00:53.600> model<00:00:53.839> use

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
better in fact that's our model use

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.169 
better in fact that's our model use
space<00:00:54.559> better<00:00:54.829> excellent<00:00:55.730> where<00:00:56.030> do<00:00:56.089> you

00:00:56.169 --> 00:00:56.179 
space better excellent where do you

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:58.149 
space better excellent where do you
store<00:00:56.420> the<00:00:56.629> electrical<00:00:57.079> components<00:00:57.260> well

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:58.159 
store the electrical components well

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:00.009

was really functional so we made sure

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:02.889 
was really functional so we made sure
that<00:02:01.490> if<00:02:01.759> you<00:02:01.939> wanted<00:02:02.299> to<00:02:02.450> you<00:02:02.659> could<00:02:02.780> have

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
then the plasma screens weighs about 100

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.800 
then the plasma screens weighs about 100
pounds<00:02:10.069> in<00:02:10.459> the<00:02:10.549> case<00:02:10.729> is<00:02:10.940> about<00:02:11.150> another<00:02:11.390> 50

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
pounds in the case is about another 50
