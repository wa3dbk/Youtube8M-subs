00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.040
 greetings to all friends of 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.799
 androidworld.it we are at stand lg 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.930
 we have here in front of us lg pro 2 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.460
 it is the second tablet 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.680
 lg tablet generation 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.390
 at the time the marketing in 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.740
 italy our country is not planned but 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.990
 it is not excluded that it can arrive in 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.199
 followed as then also was for the 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.900
 first technical features a 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:32.300
 quad core processor born read 800 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.090
 obviously from 226 giger of a screen 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.710
 by almost 6 inches or 5 inches and 9 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:44.240
 full hd resolution in ips technology 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:45.080
 memory cuts 16 32 gigabytes depends 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.340
 from the market 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.690
 we don't know what the market will be 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.490
 Italian and therefore we cannot say 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.860
 which of the two will be the variant 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:55.910
 Italian 3 gigabyte ram battery from 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:59.270
 3200 milian for a 13 camera 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:03.100
 megapixel with optical stabilizer il 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:05.750
 back button as on the current g2 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.050
 record video in 4k the camera 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.640
 obviously android 4.4 gem I show you 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.100
 the most interesting software function in 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.830
 absolute which is that of the north 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.950
 see then the current known from is 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.780
 someone who cheated us liszt and now 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.190
 when you were born tomorrow not of 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.060
 president person you wouldn't have me 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:28.480
 believed the ok then we have to choose 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.480
 how to unlock the phone for example 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.480
 so 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.160
 at this point I'm going to block it 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.300
 screen using the back button and for 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.820
 unlock 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.040
 I have to do the same the same 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:50.140
 pattern with with a tap in any 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:53.790
 part of the screen for example or again 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.790
 I can do it smaller 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.039
 or make it huge 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.360
 it's a very convenient way because it goes 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.040
 it is no longer directly on the screen 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.130
 need to insert a pin cod 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.680
 so if we combine the functionality of the 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.520
 double tap for unlocking to that of a 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.300
 pin code 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.800
 the product is beautiful I must say of course 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.120
 not knowing then the defined specifications 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.330
 for Italy it is difficult to do a bit 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.930
 evaluate is therefore connected to the internet 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:27.000
 we can do we can do ours 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.200
 try even if I don't trust much on 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.200
 network speed at the moment 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.750
 ok 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.620
 something is coming 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.790
 camp at the fair for data uploads 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.629
 they are never anything surprising 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.950
 we are definitely too many to have the 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:03:02.610
 patience to wait a few more 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:04.050
 second ok, start browsing already 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.470
 in order not to let you take further while he has 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.470
 finished 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.920
 ok the navigation is really good 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.190
 coin almost like on the two 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.140
 although this is not a version 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.090
 still definitive for our country 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.580
 however web browsing seems 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.130
 very good therefore kept one 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.540
 of the strengths of tg2 we hope for 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.950
 example also the camera that come out 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.680
 also another strong point of g2 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.090
 for this preview of lgg pro2 everything 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.050
 a greeting from manha cisotti for 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.050
