00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.160 
team deathmatch
chinle<00:02:11.700> more<00:02:12.030> it's<00:02:12.180> worth<00:02:12.239> cocoa<00:02:12.750> firm<00:02:12.959> is

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
chinle more it's worth cocoa firm is

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.199 
chinle more it's worth cocoa firm is
because<00:02:13.769> team<00:02:14.010> deathmatch<00:02:14.430> for<00:02:14.730> me<00:02:14.849> is<00:02:15.000> really

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
because team deathmatch for me is really

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.990 
because team deathmatch for me is really
campy<00:02:15.930> people<00:02:16.680> don't<00:02:16.920> really<00:02:17.159> like<00:02:17.489> to<00:02:17.730> move

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
campy people don't really like to move

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.420 
campy people don't really like to move
they<00:02:18.780> don't<00:02:18.959> seem<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.290> like<00:02:19.560> moving<00:02:20.099> very<00:02:20.280> much

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
they don't seem to like moving very much

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.699 
they don't seem to like moving very much
plus<00:02:20.939> it's<00:02:21.269> much<00:02:21.540> easier<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:22.079> get<00:02:22.319> your<00:02:22.379> kill

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
plus it's much easier to get your kill

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.500 
plus it's much easier to get your kill
streaks<00:02:23.010> in<00:02:23.220> Kill<00:02:23.459> Confirmed<00:02:23.489> and<00:02:24.180> then<00:02:24.269> team

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
streaks in Kill Confirmed and then team

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.559 
streaks in Kill Confirmed and then team
deathmatch<00:02:24.900> so<00:02:25.500> I<00:02:25.829> always<00:02:26.489> play<00:02:26.700> co<00:02:27.180> confirms

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
deathmatch so I always play co confirms

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.160 
deathmatch so I always play co confirms
and<00:02:27.900> honestly<00:02:28.650> playing<00:02:29.609> domination<00:02:30.540> is<00:02:30.780> kind

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
and honestly playing domination is kind

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.990 
and honestly playing domination is kind
of<00:02:31.260> pushing<00:02:31.530> it<00:02:31.859> a<00:02:31.890> little<00:02:32.040> bit<00:02:32.459> because<00:02:32.670> my

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
of pushing it a little bit because my

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.970 
of pushing it a little bit because my
god<00:02:33.329> some<00:02:33.720> people<00:02:33.750> don't<00:02:34.349> want<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:34.650> play<00:02:34.769> the

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.800 
objective ever at all in their life I
was<00:02:37.890> in<00:02:38.010> one<00:02:38.250> game<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.760> other<00:02:38.909> day<00:02:39.060> me<00:02:39.450> and

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
was in one game the other day me and

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.630 
was in one game the other day me and
this<00:02:40.049> one<00:02:40.349> dude<00:02:40.560> had<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.069> same<00:02:41.310> amount<00:02:41.579> of

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
this one dude had the same amount of

this one dude had the same amount of
kills<00:02:41.849> I<00:02:42.120> had<00:02:42.450> less<00:02:42.810> deaths<00:02:43.170> than<00:02:43.500> him<00:02:43.829> but<00:02:44.459> I

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
kills I had less deaths than him but I

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.940 
kills I had less deaths than him but I
had<00:02:44.760> like<00:02:44.940> five<00:02:45.299> captures<00:02:45.989> and<00:02:46.319> like<00:02:46.470> seven

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
had like five captures and like seven

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.610 
had like five captures and like seven
defends<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.519> he<00:02:47.609> had<00:02:47.790> zero<00:02:48.120> captures<00:02:48.720> zero

defense<00:02:50.099> and<00:02:50.430> we<00:02:51.150> were<00:02:51.269> constantly<00:02:51.659> getting

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
defense and we were constantly getting

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.259 
defense and we were constantly getting
our<00:02:52.349> Flags<00:02:52.889> taken<00:02:53.400> we<00:02:53.609> didn't<00:02:53.879> win<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.090> game

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
our Flags taken we didn't win the game

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.119 
our Flags taken we didn't win the game
we<00:02:54.420> were<00:02:54.540> being<00:02:54.780> freaking<00:02:55.260> dominated<00:02:55.950> and

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
we were being freaking dominated and

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:00.110 
we were being freaking dominated and
it's<00:02:57.090> just<00:02:57.359> very<00:02:57.540> hard<00:02:57.689> as<00:02:58.379> a<00:02:58.439> solo<00:02:59.250> player<00:02:59.730> to

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
it's just very hard as a solo player to

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.449 
it's just very hard as a solo player to
carry<00:03:00.480> certain<00:03:00.959> game<00:03:01.409> types<00:03:01.739> whereas<00:03:02.099> we<00:03:02.220> kill

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
carry certain game types whereas we kill

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.490 
carry certain game types whereas we kill
confirmed<00:03:02.639> in<00:03:03.060> team<00:03:03.239> deathmatch<00:03:03.420> it's<00:03:04.200> pretty

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
confirmed in team deathmatch it's pretty

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.099 
confirmed in team deathmatch it's pretty
much<00:03:04.650> all<00:03:04.889> just<00:03:05.189> about<00:03:05.430> kills<00:03:05.849> so<00:03:06.599> if<00:03:06.840> you<00:03:06.989> go

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
much all just about kills so if you go

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.589 
much all just about kills so if you go
on<00:03:07.260> a<00:03:07.290> tear<00:03:07.650> or<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:08.040> do<00:03:08.189> really<00:03:08.459> good<00:03:08.670> usually

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
on a tear or you do really good usually

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.839 
on a tear or you do really good usually
your<00:03:09.810> team<00:03:10.109> will<00:03:10.319> end<00:03:10.500> up<00:03:10.739> winning<00:03:11.069> but<00:03:11.639> in

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
your team will end up winning but in

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.050 
your team will end up winning but in
game<00:03:12.120> types<00:03:12.510> that<00:03:12.900> like<00:03:13.290> hardpoint

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
game types that like hardpoint

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.240 
game types that like hardpoint
domination<00:03:15.060> headquarters<00:03:15.930> demolition<00:03:16.739> it's

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
domination headquarters demolition it's

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.309 
domination headquarters demolition it's
not<00:03:17.489> just<00:03:17.549> about<00:03:17.910> you<00:03:18.389> it's<00:03:18.599> a<00:03:18.840> team<00:03:19.139> effort

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
not just about you it's a team effort

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.080 
not just about you it's a team effort
and<00:03:19.650> yes<00:03:19.919> you<00:03:20.069> can<00:03:20.310> i'm<00:03:20.549> not<00:03:20.669> saying<00:03:20.879> that<00:03:20.940> you

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
and yes you can i'm not saying that you

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.270 
and yes you can i'm not saying that you

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
can't carry those game types but it's

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.129 
can't carry those game types but it's
just<00:03:23.459> much<00:03:23.819> less<00:03:24.269> likely<00:03:24.720> that<00:03:24.750> you're<00:03:25.019> gonna

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
just much less likely that you're gonna

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.140 
just much less likely that you're gonna
be<00:03:25.319> able<00:03:25.349> to<00:03:25.590> be<00:03:25.739> successful<00:03:25.919> especially<00:03:26.549> if

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
be able to be successful especially if

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.539 
be able to be successful especially if
you're<00:03:27.299> playing<00:03:27.480> against<00:03:27.900> people<00:03:28.319> with<00:03:28.549> half

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
you're playing against people with half

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.720 
you're playing against people with half
a<00:03:29.849> brave<00:03:30.449> it's<00:03:30.840> gonna<00:03:31.109> be<00:03:31.319> very<00:03:31.349> difficult<00:03:31.730> to

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
a brave it's gonna be very difficult to

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.729 
a brave it's gonna be very difficult to
really<00:03:33.000> bring<00:03:33.389> the<00:03:33.419> win<00:03:33.720> home<00:03:34.049> by<00:03:34.530> yourself

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
really bring the win home by yourself

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.399 
really bring the win home by yourself
for<00:03:35.220> your<00:03:35.519> entire<00:03:35.909> team<00:03:36.269> against<00:03:37.079> people<00:03:37.379> that

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:37.409 
for your entire team against people that

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:39.349 
for your entire team against people that
actually<00:03:37.590> know<00:03:38.010> what<00:03:38.159> they're<00:03:38.250> doing<00:03:38.639> but

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
actually know what they're doing but

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.330 
actually know what they're doing but
also<00:03:39.690> another<00:03:40.260> really<00:03:40.560> big<00:03:40.739> reason<00:03:41.159> why<00:03:41.190> i

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
also another really big reason why i

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.339 
also another really big reason why i
tend<00:03:41.699> to<00:03:41.760> stay<00:03:41.940> away<00:03:41.970> from<00:03:42.389> other<00:03:42.840> game<00:03:43.079> types

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
tend to stay away from other game types

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:45.589 
tend to stay away from other game types
especially<00:03:43.769> hard<00:03:44.459> point<00:03:44.790> i'm<00:03:45.000> talking<00:03:45.329> about

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
especially hard point i'm talking about

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.439 
especially hard point i'm talking about
hard<00:03:46.049> point<00:03:46.519> specifically<00:03:47.519> when<00:03:47.879> i<00:03:47.909> say<00:03:48.239> this

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:48.449 
hard point specifically when i say this

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:51.469 
hard point specifically when i say this
the<00:03:49.290> amount<00:03:49.590> of<00:03:49.829> full<00:03:50.220> parties<00:03:50.819> that<00:03:51.060> you<00:03:51.239> run

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:51.479 
the amount of full parties that you run

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:54.710 
the amount of full parties that you run
into<00:03:51.720> in<00:03:52.229> super<00:03:52.979> objective<00:03:53.190> game<00:03:54.000> types<00:03:54.359> are

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
into in super objective game types are

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.229 
into in super objective game types are
much<00:03:55.409> higher<00:03:55.739> than<00:03:55.799> kill<00:03:56.519> confirmed<00:03:56.729> and

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
much higher than kill confirmed and

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.390 
much higher than kill confirmed and
domination<00:03:58.049> a<00:03:58.560> lot<00:03:58.889> of<00:03:58.919> people<00:03:59.040> play

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
domination a lot of people play

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.219 
domination a lot of people play
