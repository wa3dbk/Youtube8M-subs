again the forever unlock won't won't do
that<00:02:21.710> it<00:02:22.010> be<00:02:22.400> forever<00:02:22.610> unlock<00:02:23.060> will<00:02:23.780> stay

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
that it be forever unlock will stay

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.680 
that it be forever unlock will stay
unlocked<00:02:24.830> however<00:02:25.310> it<00:02:25.580> changes<00:02:26.000> your<00:02:26.150> IMEI

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
unlocked however it changes your IMEI

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.320 
unlocked however it changes your IMEI
number<00:02:27.110> to<00:02:27.230> a<00:02:27.260> generic<00:02:27.560> one<00:02:27.830> and<00:02:28.100> so<00:02:29.030> you<00:02:29.090> don't

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
number to a generic one and so you don't

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.900 
number to a generic one and so you don't
get<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:29.600> same<00:02:29.810> this<00:02:30.590> has<00:02:30.800> the<00:02:30.920> IMEI<00:02:31.280> number<00:02:31.790> on

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
get the same this has the IMEI number on

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.170 
get the same this has the IMEI number on
here<00:02:32.150> and<00:02:32.560> this<00:02:33.560> will<00:02:33.740> keep<00:02:33.890> your<00:02:34.040> original

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
here and this will keep your original

here and this will keep your original
IMEI<00:02:35.180> number<00:02:35.480> so<00:02:35.600> I<00:02:35.630> suggest<00:02:36.140> just<00:02:36.320> doing<00:02:36.620> the

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
IMEI number so I suggest just doing the

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.590 
IMEI number so I suggest just doing the
temporary<00:02:37.280> unlock<00:02:37.580> anyway<00:02:38.360> I'm<00:02:38.420> going<00:02:38.510> to

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
unlock and if you notice here it also

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.060 
unlock and if you notice here it also
says<00:02:41.630> you<00:02:41.660> can<00:02:41.900> lock<00:02:42.050> again<00:02:42.350> so<00:02:42.530> you<00:02:42.650> after
