 the presentation on the site yes it so coincided with 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.430

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.189
 advancement of parking on the decision 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.779

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.940
 the seminar was held in the format to prove 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.229
 the guilt of a person 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:50.220
 After all, every taste is an offer 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.000
 or for another reason that someone needs 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.770

 Romania also note the following 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.880
 Doctors stressed the children said that 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.000

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.560

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.050
 marketing dealing 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.640
 being on the side of energy 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.479
 tells very accessible very simply 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.090

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.210
