00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
know and that was a pretty strange deal

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.030 
know and that was a pretty strange deal
right<00:00:50.629> there<00:00:50.839> I<00:00:50.869> mean<00:00:50.960> they<00:00:51.199> basically<00:00:51.470> there

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.040 
right there I mean they basically there

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.649 
right there I mean they basically there
was<00:00:52.190> a<00:00:52.510> homeowners<00:00:54.460> association<00:00:55.460> that<00:00:56.390> was

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:56.659 
was a homeowners association that was

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:59.770 
was a homeowners association that was
just<00:00:57.100> absolutely<00:00:58.100> out<00:00:58.339> of<00:00:58.369> control<00:00:58.519> they<00:00:59.119> this

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
just absolutely out of control they this

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.719 
just absolutely out of control they this
particular<00:01:00.379> greenhouse<00:01:00.799> was<00:01:01.040> one<00:01:01.519> of<00:01:01.640> the

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:01.729 
particular greenhouse was one of the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:05.320 
particular greenhouse was one of the
nicest<00:01:01.939> ones<00:01:02.269> we<00:01:02.540> have<00:01:02.720> I<00:01:03.610> mean<00:01:04.610> a<00:01:04.640> really<00:01:04.970> nice

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
nicest ones we have I mean a really nice

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.840 
nicest ones we have I mean a really nice
greenhouse<00:01:06.020> I'm<00:01:06.560> thinking<00:01:06.979> maybe<00:01:07.159> ten

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
greenhouse I'm thinking maybe ten

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.190 
greenhouse I'm thinking maybe ten
fifteen<00:01:08.210> thousand<00:01:08.689> bucks<00:01:08.869> and<00:01:10.630> you<00:01:11.630> know<00:01:11.750> it

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
fifteen thousand bucks and you know it

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.080 
fifteen thousand bucks and you know it
wasn't<00:01:12.380> good<00:01:12.740> enough<00:01:12.770> for<00:01:13.520> the<00:01:13.609> neighborhood

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
wasn't good enough for the neighborhood

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.690 
wasn't good enough for the neighborhood
so<00:01:14.600> I<00:01:14.990> mean<00:01:15.439> if<00:01:15.619> you<00:01:15.649> if<00:01:16.070> you're<00:01:16.219> in<00:01:16.280> that<00:01:16.310> sort

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
so I mean if you if you're in that sort

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.760 
so I mean if you if you're in that sort
of<00:01:16.789> a<00:01:16.929> neighborhood<00:01:17.929> you<00:01:18.200> probably<00:01:18.560> already

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
of a neighborhood you probably already

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.039 
of a neighborhood you probably already
know<00:01:19.219> you<00:01:20.000> need<00:01:20.149> to<00:01:20.270> check<00:01:20.509> before<00:01:20.840> you<00:01:20.869> do

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
know you need to check before you do

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:22.749 
know you need to check before you do

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
a foundation for it you could you know

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:44.620 
a foundation for it you could you know
we<00:01:43.340> you<00:01:43.640> know<00:01:43.819> get<00:01:43.999> three<00:01:44.210> or<00:01:44.299> four<00:01:44.450> people

doesn't take a whole lot to take it down

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.599 
doesn't take a whole lot to take it down
even<00:02:05.090> in<00:02:05.329> sections<00:02:05.840> so<00:02:06.469> if<00:02:06.649> you<00:02:06.770> can<00:02:06.979> take<00:02:07.429> it
