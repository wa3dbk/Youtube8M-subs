00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
real problem of this figure in my

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.500 
real problem of this figure in my
opinion<00:02:46.100> is<00:02:46.790> that<00:02:46.850> is<00:02:47.240> the<00:02:47.390> awkward<00:02:47.510> head<00:02:49.510> the

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
opinion is that is the awkward head the

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.190 
opinion is that is the awkward head the
legs<00:02:50.780> are<00:02:50.900> kind<00:02:51.110> of<00:02:51.140> awkward<00:02:51.500> to<00:02:52.450> they<00:02:53.450> their

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
legs are kind of awkward to they their

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.400 
legs are kind of awkward to they their
ball<00:02:54.440> jointed<00:02:54.890> and<00:02:55.600> their<00:02:56.600> ball<00:02:56.900> jointed<00:02:57.200> an

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
ball jointed and their ball jointed an

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.750 
ball jointed and their ball jointed an
angle<00:02:57.860> so<00:02:58.930> it's<00:02:59.930> really<00:03:00.140> awkward<00:03:00.350> but<00:03:00.860> if<00:03:01.580> you

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
angle so it's really awkward but if you

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.090 
angle so it's really awkward but if you
can<00:03:01.940> just<00:03:01.970> tweak<00:03:02.810> around<00:03:02.959> with<00:03:03.320> his<00:03:03.470> poses<00:03:03.980> you

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
can just tweak around with his poses you

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.290 
can just tweak around with his poses you
can<00:03:04.220> get<00:03:04.370> pretty<00:03:04.520> good<00:03:04.730> pose<00:03:04.880> out<00:03:05.090> of<00:03:05.209> them

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
can get pretty good pose out of them

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:11.530 
can get pretty good pose out of them
kinda<00:03:05.690> like<00:03:05.750> at<00:03:05.930> how<00:03:06.050> I<00:03:06.080> have<00:03:06.260> now<00:03:08.980> but<00:03:10.540> this

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
kinda like at how I have now but this

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.990 
kinda like at how I have now but this
figure<00:03:11.810> has<00:03:12.230> really<00:03:12.620> weird<00:03:12.890> articulation<00:03:13.790> on

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
figure has really weird articulation on

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.070 
figure has really weird articulation on
his<00:03:14.750> swivel<00:03:17.800> elbows<00:03:18.800> swole<00:03:19.340> hands<00:03:20.080> balled

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
his swivel elbows swole hands balled

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.580 
his swivel elbows swole hands balled
wanted<00:03:21.470> shoulders<00:03:21.920> but<00:03:22.220> they<00:03:23.320> really<00:03:24.320> when

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
wanted shoulders but they really when

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.080 
wanted shoulders but they really when
he's<00:03:24.680> in<00:03:24.800> this<00:03:24.890> mode<00:03:25.130> here<00:03:25.340> but<00:03:25.489> really<00:03:25.790> limits

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
he's in this mode here but really limits

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.729 
he's in this mode here but really limits
his<00:03:26.180> articulation<00:03:26.420> so<00:03:26.959> it's<00:03:27.110> not<00:03:27.230> very<00:03:27.440> good

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
his articulation so it's not very good

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.180 
his articulation so it's not very good
um<00:03:28.330> and<00:03:29.330> his<00:03:30.320> legs<00:03:30.620> really<00:03:30.800> don't<00:03:31.010> move<00:03:31.100> it

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
um and his legs really don't move it

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.270 
um and his legs really don't move it
also<00:03:31.550> for<00:03:31.700> the<00:03:31.760> the<00:03:32.630> the<00:03:33.590> feet<00:03:33.860> they<00:03:34.160> have

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
also for the the the feet they have

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.820 
also for the the the feet they have
balls<00:03:34.489> on<00:03:34.610> her<00:03:34.700> feet<00:03:35.380> one<00:03:36.380> of<00:03:36.440> the<00:03:36.530> legs<00:03:36.650> you

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
balls on her feet one of the legs you

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.080 
balls on her feet one of the legs you
can't<00:03:37.040> move<00:03:37.160> it<00:03:37.280> all<00:03:37.400> because<00:03:37.640> of<00:03:37.670> the<00:03:37.790> gimmick

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
can't move it all because of the gimmick

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.900 
can't move it all because of the gimmick
which<00:03:38.989> is<00:03:39.200> this<00:03:39.470> and<00:03:39.739> some<00:03:40.489> of<00:03:40.519> the<00:03:40.640> armors

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
which is this and some of the armors

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.449 
which is this and some of the armors
falling<00:03:41.269> off<00:03:41.950> I'm<00:03:42.950> gonna<00:03:43.070> take<00:03:43.190> him<00:03:43.340> off<00:03:43.430> the

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
falling off I'm gonna take him off the

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.509 
falling off I'm gonna take him off the
stand<00:03:44.530> but<00:03:45.530> he<00:03:45.680> does<00:03:46.660> it's<00:03:47.660> supposed<00:03:47.840> to<00:03:48.080> swing

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
stand but he does it's supposed to swing

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.789 
stand but he does it's supposed to swing
but<00:03:49.519> he<00:03:49.610> can't<00:03:49.790> really<00:03:49.880> do<00:03:50.060> it<00:03:50.090> in<00:03:50.330> this<00:03:50.540> mode

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
but he can't really do it in this mode

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.830 
but he can't really do it in this mode
this<00:03:51.799> kind<00:03:52.040> of<00:03:52.130> swims<00:03:52.519> as<00:03:52.730> soon<00:03:53.330> as<00:03:53.450> his<00:03:53.510> sword

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
this kind of swims as soon as his sword

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:00.220 
this kind of swims as soon as his sword
it's<00:03:54.769> really<00:03:54.950> a<00:03:55.070> crappy<00:03:55.670> figure<00:03:58.600> that<00:03:59.600> said<00:03:59.989> he

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
it's really a crappy figure that said he

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:01.900 
it's really a crappy figure that said he
does<00:04:00.380> look<00:04:00.650> cool<00:04:00.860> standing<00:04:01.340> there<00:04:01.519> that's

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
does look cool standing there that's

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.210 
does look cool standing there that's
about<00:04:02.299> it<00:04:02.330> though<00:04:05.410> the<00:04:06.410> Homer<00:04:06.620> can<00:04:06.830> be<00:04:06.950> taken

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
about it though the Homer can be taken

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.539 
about it though the Homer can be taken
off<00:04:08.470> but<00:04:09.470> it<00:04:09.530> looks<00:04:09.680> so<00:04:09.830> goofy<00:04:10.250> without<00:04:10.459> the

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
off but it looks so goofy without the

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:11.800 
off but it looks so goofy without the
armor<00:04:10.730> that<00:04:10.880> I'm<00:04:11.030> learning<00:04:11.090> of<00:04:11.360> a<00:04:11.390> baller<00:04:11.600> with

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
armor that I'm learning of a baller with

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.250 
armor that I'm learning of a baller with
it<00:04:12.190> there's<00:04:13.190> the<00:04:13.489> face<00:04:13.670> sculpt<00:04:14.000> in<00:04:14.840> my<00:04:15.019> opinion

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
it there's the face sculpt in my opinion

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.930 
it there's the face sculpt in my opinion
it<00:04:15.470> looks<00:04:15.620> better<00:04:15.830> than<00:04:16.040> the<00:04:16.160> fiscal<00:04:16.519> for<00:04:16.790> this

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
it looks better than the fiscal for this

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.240 
it looks better than the fiscal for this
figure<00:04:17.299> and<00:04:17.959> you

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
figure and you

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.980 
figure and you
can<00:04:19.370> actually<00:04:19.730> switch<00:04:19.910> the<00:04:20.120> heads<00:04:22.840> but<00:04:23.840> for

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
can actually switch the heads but for

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.420 
can actually switch the heads but for
some<00:04:24.140> reason<00:04:24.440> it<00:04:24.500> was<00:04:24.650> awkward<00:04:24.890> with<00:04:25.160> this

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
some reason it was awkward with this

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.030 
some reason it was awkward with this
head<00:04:25.610> on<00:04:25.640> there<00:04:25.910> i<00:04:25.940> don't<00:04:26.210> know<00:04:26.330> why<00:04:26.570> i<00:04:27.040> think

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
head on there i don't know why i think

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.790 
head on there i don't know why i think
it<00:04:28.130> may<00:04:28.220> be<00:04:28.280> the<00:04:28.430> neck<00:04:29.170> the<00:04:30.170> neck<00:04:30.320> joints<00:04:30.680> are

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
it may be the neck the neck joints are

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.510 
it may be the neck the neck joints are
different<00:04:32.320> like<00:04:33.320> one<00:04:33.530> of<00:04:33.620> them's<00:04:33.770> longer<00:04:34.130> was

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
different like one of them's longer was

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.310 
different like one of them's longer was
short<00:04:34.760> or<00:04:34.880> something<00:04:35.030> like<00:04:35.210> that<00:04:36.910> anyways

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
short or something like that anyways

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.930 
short or something like that anyways
this<00:04:39.320> one<00:04:39.440> is<00:04:39.560> still<00:04:39.710> an<00:04:39.920> okay<00:04:40.190> figure<00:04:40.580> and<00:04:40.880> i

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
this one is still an okay figure and i

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.840 
this one is still an okay figure and i
would<00:04:41.090> still<00:04:41.980> recommend<00:04:42.980> having<00:04:43.460> him<00:04:43.700> in<00:04:43.790> your

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
would still recommend having him in your

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.810 
would still recommend having him in your
collection<00:04:44.060> just<00:04:44.360> to<00:04:44.510> have<00:04:44.690> him<00:04:45.700> but<00:04:46.700> this

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
collection just to have him but this

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.100 
collection just to have him but this
one's<00:04:47.060> definitely<00:04:47.210> the<00:04:47.450> better<00:04:47.570> figures<00:04:47.930> for

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
one's definitely the better figures for

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.520 
one's definitely the better figures for
his<00:04:48.200> articulation<00:04:48.410> goes<00:04:49.000> and<00:04:50.000> actually<00:04:50.530> if

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
his articulation goes and actually if

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:57.960 
his articulation goes and actually if
you<00:04:52.130> wanted<00:04:52.430> to<00:04:54.040> you<00:04:55.040> could<00:04:55.490> technically

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
you wanted to you could technically

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:05.850 
you wanted to you could technically
stick<00:04:58.970> this<00:04:59.240> helmet<00:04:59.890> on<00:05:00.890> this<00:05:01.070> figure<00:05:04.570> however

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
stick this helmet on this figure however

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.250 
stick this helmet on this figure however
a<00:05:07.210> little<00:05:08.210> bit<00:05:08.300> of<00:05:08.360> a<00:05:08.419> problem<00:05:08.660> with<00:05:08.960> the<00:05:09.050> hair

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
a little bit of a problem with the hair

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.380 
a little bit of a problem with the hair
sticking<00:05:09.530> out<00:05:09.740> so<00:05:10.310> it<00:05:10.430> looks<00:05:10.580> too<00:05:10.790> small<00:05:10.820> but

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.130 
not fixed while trying to fix it several

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.770 
not fixed while trying to fix it several
times<00:06:22.280> it<00:06:22.550> just<00:06:22.580> doesn't<00:06:22.970> fix<00:06:23.150> it<00:06:23.330> warps<00:06:23.600> back

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.530 
into place
so<00:06:25.950> it's<00:06:26.070> a<00:06:26.130> crappy<00:06:26.370> crappy<00:06:27.060> one<00:06:27.300> but<00:06:27.450> I<00:06:27.480> do

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:27.540 
so it's a crappy crappy one but I do

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.570 
so it's a crappy crappy one but I do
like<00:06:27.780> it<00:06:27.960> a<00:06:27.990> lot<00:06:28.170> there<00:06:28.410> as<00:06:28.590> far<00:06:28.770> as<00:06:28.890> look<00:06:29.160> those

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.580 
like it a lot there as far as look those

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.240 
like it a lot there as far as look those
I<00:06:29.910> like<00:06:30.150> the<00:06:30.330> white<00:06:30.800> this<00:06:31.800> is<00:06:31.920> the<00:06:32.010> one<00:06:32.130> that

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:32.250 
I like the white this is the one that

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.330 
I like the white this is the one that
this<00:06:32.430> this<00:06:32.730> figure<00:06:32.970> came<00:06:33.120> with<00:06:33.330> and<00:06:34.040> as<00:06:35.040> far<00:06:35.280> as

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:35.340 
this this figure came with and as far as

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:36.800 
this this figure came with and as far as
design<00:06:35.760> goes<00:06:36.030> it's<00:06:36.210> a<00:06:36.240> lot<00:06:36.390> better<00:06:36.510> because

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:36.810 
design goes it's a lot better because

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:38.900 
design goes it's a lot better because
it's<00:06:37.050> a<00:06:37.200> harder<00:06:37.530> plastic<00:06:37.740> it<00:06:38.160> doesn't<00:06:38.430> warp<00:06:38.670> is

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:38.910 
it's a harder plastic it doesn't warp is

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.870 
it's a harder plastic it doesn't warp is
easy<00:06:39.440> and<00:06:40.440> it<00:06:40.830> actually<00:06:40.980> detaches<00:06:41.640> hit<00:06:41.790> the

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:41.880 
easy and it actually detaches hit the

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.800 
easy and it actually detaches hit the
handle<00:06:42.300> which<00:06:42.750> is<00:06:42.900> pretty<00:06:43.080> cool<00:06:44.600> so<00:06:45.600> this<00:06:45.780> is

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:45.810 
handle which is pretty cool so this is

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.900 
handle which is pretty cool so this is
definitely<00:06:46.140> the<00:06:46.980> better<00:06:47.130> figure<00:06:47.400> of<00:06:47.610> the<00:06:47.730> two

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:47.910 
definitely the better figure of the two

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.750 
definitely the better figure of the two
and<00:06:48.540> i'm<00:06:48.690> easily<00:06:48.930> give<00:06:49.230> him<00:06:49.380> at<00:06:49.920> any<00:06:50.550> point

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:50.760 
and i'm easily give him at any point

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.540 
and i'm easily give him at any point
five<00:06:51.030> or<00:06:51.300> nine<00:06:51.590> if<00:06:52.590> you're<00:06:52.710> obi<00:06:52.920> wan<00:06:53.070> fan<00:06:53.310> he's

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:53.550 
five or nine if you're obi wan fan he's

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:54.980 
five or nine if you're obi wan fan he's
definitely<00:06:53.970> not<00:06:54.030> and<00:06:54.360> if<00:06:54.420> you're<00:06:54.570> if<00:06:54.810> you're

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:54.990 
definitely not and if you're if you're

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.350 
definitely not and if you're if you're
not<00:06:55.230> so<00:06:55.710> prone<00:06:56.250> to<00:06:56.520> obi-wan<00:06:56.790> as<00:06:57.150> to<00:06:57.240> other

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 
not so prone to obi-wan as to other

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.660 
not so prone to obi-wan as to other
characters<00:06:57.870> he's<00:06:58.020> probably<00:06:58.200> 8.5<00:06:58.950> but<00:06:59.610> he

00:06:59.660 --> 00:06:59.670 
characters he's probably 8.5 but he

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:02.510 
characters he's probably 8.5 but he
definitely<00:06:59.910> worth<00:07:00.150> picking<00:07:00.180> up<00:07:01.280> so<00:07:02.280> that's<00:07:02.430> my

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:02.520 
definitely worth picking up so that's my

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:07.340 
definitely worth picking up so that's my
review<00:07:02.670> and<00:07:04.700> keep<00:07:05.700> watching<00:07:05.880> the<00:07:06.870> reviews<00:07:07.200> for
