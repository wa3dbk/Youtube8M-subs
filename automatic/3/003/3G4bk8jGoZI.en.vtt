00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.000
 Tell me, what are you talking about? 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.309
 here is the language, I'm not much 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.160
 known on youtube but created my channel 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.670
 a few minutes ago with a 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.220
 new proposal and to launch new videos 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.029
 ipad games in online ways 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.270
 also 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.609
 and if you can follow my channel there 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.970
 I'm really happy to come back casting 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.010
 new video games for way out 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.269
 I'm releasing my first video that 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.700
 about shaving the ball 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.040
 This is an online game if you can play 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.270
 online or you can play solo if you want 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.969
 want is cool then I'm going to give me a 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:47.520
 explanation of how the game is to see if 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:52.320
 You like it, I started playing. 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.390
 Yesterday, every level 16 is already for me. 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.870
 a lot because I only played four more 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:01.039
 It was not even 45 hours later. 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.559
 time out playing 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:07.080
 I'm here, my doll here. 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:11.220
 I already bought things for him and I got better. 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:17.220
 here I have four agility and 5% 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:20.909
 Mirai here have emissions which is a 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.210
 solo right here at the beginning he gives 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.210
 some missions for you to complete and 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.780
 I do not recommend to you that you are 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.840
 beginners to play on the ground only one or 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.450
 two matches so because on the ground you 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.610
 earns very little experience 'wins 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.500
 very little money I 'll be 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.310
 showing here for you right? 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:48.780
 How is it more or less already released? 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:51.090
 do you here right are you the more you 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.060
 level you earn more money 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.000
 releases more make weapons more clothes and 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.909
 So I 'm going to play here the first time 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.270
 sand city to show you 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:06.710
 How is it that it's more or less that I'm already good? 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.310
 So I'll sculpt the crazy ones. 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.230
 machine gun which is very good 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.370
 I do not remember now riding remembered for 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.940
 kenny bell labs but it takes a while 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.410
 the game is very similar by the following 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.140
 Motherfucker killed what he warmed up. 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.050
 The interesting game by following you 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.230
 can use online play to the ground and also 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:32.260
 has a lot of mobility in which you have 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.590
 lots of mobility do what you want 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.470
 many and many levels yet to be 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.690
 past problem is that there is a 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.709
 game every Sunday if you arrive at 30 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.440
 fifth grade 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.390
 end the game must only stay playing 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.750
 even to sculpt crazy and such 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:52.269
 level 30 is the last day for them to 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.750
 launch updates then you play well 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:57.670
 and I'm here on the floor 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.310
 certain phases usually take place in 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.230
 four good minutes of points also 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:08.140
 you want 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:09.970
 the gun belongs analyzed is a guy 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.000
 better but there 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.160
 but then it leaves the impact they release 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.310
 that kind of letter over there in the most kind 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.620
 short mountain medals with more 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.320
 medals to get you to win more 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.019
 set 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:39.940
 first with 600 points 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:42.720
 the first part is easy for me is this 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:46.329
 game is also very interesting because 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.280
 so your life is not just one you can 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:49.239
 stop to catch one can stop to 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.069
 to charge 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.410
 There are many things for you to do. 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.970
 develop if you can develop tactics 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.650
 also because if you want to have a 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.650
 batuqueiro 1 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:11.069
 Do you think it's good not to create it later? 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:19.299
 you must hide because you will see the band 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:20.530
 to hit the point more started at the beginning 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.610
 of the year 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:26.560
 was the missions you play 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.220
 alone in this reminder that more layoffs 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.900
 these players are no longer one of the other 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.270
 and you do not get much of a door 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.660
 experience in pursuit of money there 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:41.500
 the match is over 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:45.060
 I won here, I killed 394, it's not mine. 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:48.460
 best score ever killed 18 and died and 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:52.419
 earns 950 experience that is nothing to 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:59.190
 me and 340 of money 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:05:03.750
 good here the difference is almost nothing 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:06.130
 now show you here here person 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.080
 clicked this up arrow you 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:11.200
 improve your skills 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.270
 I recommend to you there is always lend 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:17.560
 attention to the skill description 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:21.370
 because many skills here are kind 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:25.000
 this one increases 10% of the reach I do not 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:27.640
 I bought the following because depending on 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.310
 weapon you have you should buy 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.360
 this type increases here by 10% in 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.340
 shotgun 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.470
 this area here on the revolver does not 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:39.419
 none of these so I'll buy up 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:42.820
 to waste money for nothing here you come 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:47.080
 applying on this line that you had to 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:51.120
 say redirects weapons to type 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.120
 head you want to use the body to 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:59.140
 show that the first one begins with 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:04.210
 machine gun to innovate that this weapon 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:06.070
 here it has a weak damage with range 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.810
 a weak forecast weakens but it gives a 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.800
 a little skill for you but no 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:12.729
 it's no big deal 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:14.890
 You will start here realizing the e 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:17.440
 then releasing passing level goes 

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:20.919
 releasing riff from brigade and such and such 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:23.860
 So I play with the assault refi now. 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:27.700
 with school cup 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.330
 this scope is this mirim and infrared 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.460
 such 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.849
 the gun owner is not very strong but the 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:35.789
 range and accuracy are very good 

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:38.429
 That's why I bought a skull 

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:41.279
 head that way and soldier a body 

00:06:38.429 --> 00:06:44.999
 Strong here and bought these pants 

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:46.979
 here it gives two and agility the body 

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:51.719
 here also activity data and this 

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:54.830
 head I spent 50 diamond plus 95 

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:54.830
 of precision then I
