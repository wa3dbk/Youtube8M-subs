welcome<00:00:01.230> to<00:00:01.410> digital<00:00:01.530> toolbox<00:00:02.129> today<00:00:02.520> we're

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
welcome to digital toolbox today we're

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.550 
welcome to digital toolbox today we're
going<00:00:02.939> to<00:00:03.120> apply<00:00:03.330> interval<00:00:03.840> boxes<00:00:04.290> to<00:00:04.529> our

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
going to apply interval boxes to our

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.349 
going to apply interval boxes to our
list<00:00:05.009> of<00:00:05.190> points<00:00:05.490> to<00:00:05.670> create<00:00:05.940> our<00:00:06.060> staircase

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
list of points to create our staircase

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.650 
list of points to create our staircase
and<00:00:07.069> I<00:00:08.069> also<00:00:08.220> add<00:00:08.460> three<00:00:08.790> new<00:00:08.970> sliders<00:00:09.389> they're

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
and I also add three new sliders they're

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.720 
and I also add three new sliders they're
called<00:00:09.840> step<00:00:10.260> with<00:00:10.530> landing<00:00:11.280> tread<00:00:11.519> and

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
called step with landing tread and

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.280 
called step with landing tread and
landing<00:00:12.210> with<00:00:12.389> since<00:00:12.809> we're<00:00:12.929> going<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.080> create

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
landing with since we're going to create

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.490 
landing with since we're going to create
a<00:00:13.349> landing<00:00:13.769> with<00:00:13.950> our<00:00:14.130> staircase<00:00:14.400> also<00:00:15.379> so<00:00:16.379> to

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
a landing with our staircase also so to

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.470 
a landing with our staircase also so to
get<00:00:16.590> started<00:00:16.710> I'm<00:00:17.039> going<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.400> go<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.580> surface

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
get started I'm going to go to surface

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.859 
get started I'm going to go to surface
go<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.810> primitive<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.529> grab<00:00:19.890> an<00:00:20.039> interval<00:00:20.430> box

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:20.869 
go to primitive and grab an interval box

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:23.420 
go to primitive and grab an interval box
you<00:00:21.869> know<00:00:21.960> apply<00:00:22.230> this<00:00:22.410> box<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.160> list<00:00:23.340> of

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
you know apply this box to the list of

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.990 
you know apply this box to the list of
points<00:00:23.660> and<00:00:24.660> now<00:00:24.810> we<00:00:24.869> have<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.590> staircase<00:00:26.010> but

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
points and now we have a staircase but

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.640 
points and now we have a staircase but
they're<00:00:27.119> all<00:00:27.240> with<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.480> same<00:00:27.689> list<00:00:27.930> I<00:00:28.170> mean

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
they're all with the same list I mean

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.250 
they're all with the same list I mean
same<00:00:28.859> dimensions<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.820> one<00:00:30.179> since<00:00:30.599> x<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.019> y<00:00:31.109> and

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
same dimensions of one since x and y and

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.490 
same dimensions of one since x and y and
z<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.470> default<00:00:31.890> by<00:00:32.009> one<00:00:32.219> feet<00:00:33.170> so<00:00:34.170> we<00:00:34.290> want<00:00:34.440> to

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
z is default by one feet so we want to

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.740 
z is default by one feet so we want to
apply<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:35.070> our<00:00:35.100> sliders<00:00:35.820> we<00:00:36.420> also<00:00:36.570> need

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
apply this to our sliders we also need

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.250 
apply this to our sliders we also need
to<00:00:36.809> convert<00:00:37.079> our<00:00:37.940> increments<00:00:38.940> into<00:00:39.120> inches<00:00:39.540> so

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
to convert our increments into inches so

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.049 
to convert our increments into inches so
I'm<00:00:40.320> going<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.640> grab<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.670> one<00:00:41.910> variable

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
I'm going to grab a one variable

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.869 
I'm going to grab a one variable
expression<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.190> change<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.309> expression<00:00:44.520> 2x

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
expression and change the expression 2x

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.819 
expression and change the expression 2x
over<00:00:45.329> 12<00:00:46.309> I'm<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.399> copy<00:00:47.610> this<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.090> paste<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.829> the

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
over 12 I'm a copy this and paste it the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.260 
over 12 I'm a copy this and paste it the
thickness<00:00:50.250> needs<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.640> be<00:00:50.760> changed<00:00:51.149> into

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
thickness needs to be changed into

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.319 
thickness needs to be changed into
inches<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.960> also<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.649> tread<00:00:54.289> so<00:00:55.289> X<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.860> our

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
inches and also the tread so X is our

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:02.720 
inches and also the tread so X is our
step<00:00:57.329> with<00:00:58.309> why<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.370> our<00:00:59.730> tread<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:01.010> z<00:01:02.010> is<00:01:02.250> our

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
step with why is our tread and z is our

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.149 
step with why is our tread and z is our
thickness<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.420> step<00:01:03.629> so<00:01:04.559> now<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.710> can<00:01:05.010> see

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
thickness of the step so now you can see

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.679 
thickness of the step so now you can see
if<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.339> zoom<00:01:05.580> in<00:01:05.790> there<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.990> steps<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:08.689> must

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
if you zoom in there the steps I must

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.520 
if you zoom in there the steps I must
change<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.140> step<00:01:10.380> with<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.830> five<00:01:12.320> next<00:01:13.320> thing

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
change the step with to five next thing

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.020 
change the step with to five next thing
we<00:01:13.590> want<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.799> do<00:01:13.890> is<00:01:13.979> create<00:01:14.250> our<00:01:14.280> landing<00:01:14.820> and

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
we want to do is create our landing and

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.969 
we want to do is create our landing and
our<00:01:15.689> landing<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.259> very<00:01:16.560> top<00:01:16.830> step<00:01:18.860> so<00:01:19.860> the

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
our landing is the very top step so the

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.490 
our landing is the very top step so the
very<00:01:20.189> top<00:01:20.400> step<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.720> last<00:01:21.960> one<00:01:22.170> which<00:01:22.380> is

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
very top step is the last one which is

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.749 
very top step is the last one which is
nineteen<00:01:22.920> nine<00:01:23.820> point<00:01:24.270> eight<00:01:24.479> thirty<00:01:24.780> three

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
nineteen nine point eight thirty three

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:31.429 
nineteen nine point eight thirty three
so<00:01:26.759> I'm<00:01:26.939> go<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.890> split<00:01:28.890> list

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.349 

and<00:01:31.740> it's<00:01:32.130> going<00:01:32.249> to<00:01:32.340> split<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.700> list<00:01:32.909> into

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:33.359 
and it's going to split the list into

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:35.330 
and it's going to split the list into
two<00:01:33.390> two<00:01:34.319> categories

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
two two categories

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.309 
two two categories
I<00:01:35.369> want<00:01:35.850> one<00:01:36.060> which<00:01:36.329> is<00:01:36.479> all<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.780> steps<00:01:37.079> and

00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:37.319 
I want one which is all the steps and

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:42.139 
I want one which is all the steps and
another<00:01:38.039> one<00:01:38.219> which<00:01:38.490> is<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.880> landing<00:01:40.670> so<00:01:41.670> it's

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
another one which is the landing so it's

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.779 
another one which is the landing so it's
the<00:01:42.539> night<00:01:42.689> is<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.259> last<00:01:43.409> step<00:01:43.770> of<00:01:43.950> 20<00:01:44.549> steps

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
the night is the last step of 20 steps

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:47.779 
the night is the last step of 20 steps
so<00:01:45.119> we<00:01:45.270> want<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.509> split<00:01:45.750> 19<00:01:46.679> steps<00:01:47.069> and<00:01:47.369> one

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
so we want to split 19 steps and one

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:50.499 
so we want to split 19 steps and one
step<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.299> do<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.689> we<00:01:49.560> need<00:01:49.679> to<00:01:49.770> count<00:01:49.950> the

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
step to do that we need to count the

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.059 
step to do that we need to count the
number<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.539> items<00:01:51.840> in<00:01:52.109> the<00:01:52.170> list<00:01:52.229> so<00:01:52.770> I'm<00:01:52.859> going

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:53.069 
number of items in the list so I'm going

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:59.480 
number of items in the list so I'm going
to<00:01:53.130> list<00:01:53.310> length<00:01:55.939> so<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.090> says<00:01:57.299> 20<00:01:57.810> items<00:01:58.490> and

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
to list length so it says 20 items and

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.249 
to list length so it says 20 items and
then<00:01:59.609> I<00:01:59.640> go<00:01:59.819> to<00:01:59.849> expression<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.569> I<00:02:00.630> type<00:02:00.840> in<00:02:01.049> I

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
then I go to expression and I type in I

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:07.369 
then I go to expression and I type in I
minus<00:02:02.069> I<00:02:02.659> minus<00:02:03.659> 1<00:02:05.360> commit<00:02:06.360> changes<00:02:06.780> so<00:02:07.259> it's

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:07.379 
minus I minus 1 commit changes so it's

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:10.279 
minus I minus 1 commit changes so it's
going<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.560> take<00:02:07.799> 20<00:02:08.420> items<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.660> subtract<00:02:10.049> 1

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
going to take 20 items and subtract 1

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.640 
going to take 20 items and subtract 1
and<00:02:10.560> it's<00:02:11.190> going<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.340> output<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:11.790> into<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:12.840> and

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
and it's going to output that into a and

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.880 
and it's going to output that into a and
b.a<00:02:14.040> which<00:02:14.549> is<00:02:14.670> our<00:02:14.819> steps<00:02:15.090> 19<00:02:15.660> items<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:16.260> B

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
b.a which is our steps 19 items and B

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.440 
b.a which is our steps 19 items and B
will<00:02:17.160> be<00:02:17.280> our<00:02:17.400> landing<00:02:17.819> which<00:02:18.030> is<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.269> last

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
will be our landing which is the last

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.860 
will be our landing which is the last
step<00:02:18.950> so<00:02:19.950> now<00:02:20.040> will<00:02:20.250> reapply<00:02:20.670> our<00:02:20.849> boxes<00:02:21.269> to<00:02:21.480> a

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
step so now will reapply our boxes to a

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.699 
step so now will reapply our boxes to a
or<00:02:22.470> landing<00:02:23.129> I<00:02:23.280> mean<00:02:23.849> our<00:02:23.910> our<00:02:24.030> steps<00:02:24.329> and<00:02:24.709> then

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
or landing I mean our our steps and then

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.979 
or landing I mean our our steps and then
I'm<00:02:25.799> go<00:02:25.980> back<00:02:26.160> to<00:02:26.370> surface<00:02:26.849> go<00:02:27.720> back<00:02:27.870> to

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
I'm go back to surface go back to

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.780 
I'm go back to surface go back to
primitive<00:02:28.410> and<00:02:28.650> grab<00:02:28.950> another<00:02:29.040> interval<00:02:29.549> box

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
primitive and grab another interval box

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.690 
primitive and grab another interval box
and<00:02:30.090> this<00:02:30.930> will<00:02:31.079> go<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.230> B<00:02:31.470> which<00:02:32.250> will<00:02:32.430> be<00:02:32.549> our

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
and this will go to B which will be our

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.830 
and this will go to B which will be our
landing<00:02:36.139> so<00:02:37.139> landing<00:02:37.500> width<00:02:37.739> will<00:02:37.950> go<00:02:38.069> into<00:02:38.220> X

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
landing so landing width will go into X

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.259 
landing so landing width will go into X
the<00:02:39.840> thickness<00:02:40.319> will<00:02:40.530> go<00:02:40.650> into<00:02:40.940> the<00:02:41.940> thickness

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
the thickness will go into the thickness

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.559 
the thickness will go into the thickness
and<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:43.340> Y<00:02:44.340> which<00:02:44.639> will<00:02:44.790> be<00:02:44.940> our<00:02:45.150> landing

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
and the Y which will be our landing

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:53.620 
and the Y which will be our landing
tread<00:02:47.480> in<00:02:48.480> case<00:02:48.690> we<00:02:48.840> want<00:02:49.079> a<00:02:49.260> longer<00:02:49.680> landing

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.380 

so<00:02:54.630> I<00:02:54.660> rename<00:02:55.079> this<00:02:55.260> box<00:02:55.669> landing

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
so I rename this box landing

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.870 
so I rename this box landing
and<00:02:58.480> this<00:02:59.170> box<00:02:59.640> steps<00:03:02.130> and<00:03:03.130> then<00:03:03.640> I'm<00:03:03.700> going<00:03:03.850> to

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
and this box steps and then I'm going to

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.360 
and this box steps and then I'm going to
unpretty<00:03:04.270> B<00:03:04.959> so<00:03:05.500> I<00:03:05.530> get<00:03:05.770> rid<00:03:05.860> of<00:03:05.920> the<00:03:06.040> points

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
unpretty B so I get rid of the points

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:12.150 
unpretty B so I get rid of the points
and<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:08.709> split<00:03:10.020> so<00:03:11.020> now<00:03:11.140> there<00:03:11.319> you<00:03:11.440> have<00:03:11.590> it

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
and the split so now there you have it

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.390 
and the split so now there you have it
staircase<00:03:12.880> being<00:03:13.690> controlled<00:03:14.110> directly<00:03:15.010> by

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
staircase being controlled directly by

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.130 
staircase being controlled directly by
the<00:03:15.459> height<00:03:15.820> the<00:03:16.150> tread<00:03:16.450> the<00:03:16.660> rise<00:03:16.840> the

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
the height the tread the rise the

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.510 
the height the tread the rise the
thickness<00:03:17.500> and<00:03:17.680> then<00:03:17.830> you<00:03:17.950> have<00:03:18.070> controls<00:03:18.430> for

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
thickness and then you have controls for

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.520 
thickness and then you have controls for
the<00:03:18.700> landing<00:03:19.060> it<00:03:19.630> also<00:03:19.780> tells<00:03:20.110> you<00:03:20.290> if<00:03:20.410> the

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
the landing it also tells you if the

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.040 
the landing it also tells you if the
code<00:03:20.800> is<00:03:20.830> passing<00:03:21.820> or<00:03:21.940> failing<00:03:21.970> and<00:03:22.480> it<00:03:22.840> tells

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
code is passing or failing and it tells

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.229 
code is passing or failing and it tells
you<00:03:23.170> the<00:03:23.260> number<00:03:23.380> of<00:03:23.590> steps<00:03:23.860> and<00:03:24.130> that's<00:03:25.060> how

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
you the number of steps and that's how

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.540 
you the number of steps and that's how
you<00:03:25.300> create<00:03:25.540> a<00:03:25.690> staircase<00:03:25.930> with<00:03:26.380> a<00:03:26.410> VB<00:03:26.950> net<00:03:27.160> and

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
you create a staircase with a VB net and

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.030 
you create a staircase with a VB net and
thanks<00:03:27.850> for<00:03:27.970> watching
