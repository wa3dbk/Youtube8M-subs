00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.209
 the whaling ship on which we climb for this short journey 

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:24.050
 it was raw 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.839
 9 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:28.580
 which was built shortly after 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.439
 in 1900 39 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.030
 enel which navigation museum 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.030
 is still found 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.160
 this fully functional model is complete with all the details 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.660
 it was built by massimo de zan 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.650
 which is part of the fleet I love 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.470
 association navimodellisti valley olona of castellanza 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.470
 in the province of varese 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.950
 whaling 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.220
 started already in prehistory although in a very rudimentary way 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.870
 reached its maximum intensity 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.250
 in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.160
 in the Atlantic Ocean, especially sperm whales were exterminated 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.120
 whale polar whales franke 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.730
 gray whales 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.890
 what a humpback whale 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.509
 when these gigantic mammals became scarce 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.690
 the whalers moved into the Indian and peaceful oceans 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.160
 also whales have to be caught 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.060
 blue whales 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.500
 the boreal whales 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.360
 than previously 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.530
 thanks to their high speed 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.010
 the lack of buoyancy after death is over 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.100
 they escaped the old hunting systems 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.430
 were used 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.159
 fast motor whaling 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:14.959
 equipped with explosive crampons launched with a cannon 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:21.759
 and devices that blow air into the cold to prevent them from building up 

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:30.339
 the dancers have always been hunted for economic reasons 

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:35.009
 in fact, meat can be made from it 

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:37.089
 lubricating oil 

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:40.139
 feed for livestock and pets 

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:43.959
 cosmetics product 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.369
 manure 

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:50.979
 margarine and once even aspects and for women's busts 

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:59.829
 the drastic reduction in the number of specimens led the commission 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:02.949
 international for whaling 

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:09.409
 to establish a moratorium on commercial hunting in 1986 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:12.759
 even if not all nations 

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:15.759
 have followed this indication 

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:24.430
 in some cases an increase in the number of specimens was detected 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:27.259
 but for some species 

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:30.259
 the risk of extinction exists 

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:34.769
 if you want to know more
