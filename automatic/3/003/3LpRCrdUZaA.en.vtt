let's<00:00:04.590> talk<00:00:04.830> about<00:00:05.300> one<00:00:06.300> thought<00:00:06.540> of<00:00:06.720> a<00:00:07.050> huge

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
let's talk about one thought of a huge

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.919 
let's talk about one thought of a huge
portfolio<00:00:07.800> of<00:00:08.099> different<00:00:08.880> gas<00:00:09.000> torches<00:00:09.420> the

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
portfolio of different gas torches the

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.029 
portfolio of different gas torches the
super<00:00:10.290> fire<00:00:10.500> 3<00:00:10.860> which<00:00:11.759> is<00:00:12.530> definitely<00:00:13.530> one<00:00:14.009> of

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:14.039 
super fire 3 which is definitely one of

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:16.670 
super fire 3 which is definitely one of
the<00:00:14.249> most<00:00:14.459> versatile<00:00:15.179> and<00:00:15.419> safe<00:00:15.660> torture<00:00:16.320> who

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
the most versatile and safe torture who

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.680 
the most versatile and safe torture who
you<00:00:16.830> find<00:00:17.070> cheaper<00:00:17.369> one<00:00:17.490> on<00:00:17.580> market<00:00:18.000> but<00:00:18.480> none

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
you find cheaper one on market but none

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.660 
you find cheaper one on market but none
which<00:00:19.230> combines<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.769> versatility<00:00:20.429> in<00:00:20.580> the

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
which combines the versatility in the

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.689 
which combines the versatility in the
safety<00:00:20.910> of<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.539> super<00:00:21.840> fire<00:00:22.019> 3<00:00:22.550> starting<00:00:23.550> with

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
safety of the super fire 3 starting with

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.759 
safety of the super fire 3 starting with
the<00:00:23.789> versatility<00:00:24.179> it's<00:00:25.109> very<00:00:25.470> easy<00:00:25.650> to

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
the versatility it's very easy to

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.939 
the versatility it's very easy to
exchange<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.519> nozzles<00:00:26.880> like<00:00:27.119> just<00:00:27.710> twist<00:00:28.710> and

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
exchange the nozzles like just twist and

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.040 
exchange the nozzles like just twist and
take<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:29.849> away<00:00:31.640> take<00:00:32.640> another<00:00:32.970> one<00:00:33.270> depending

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
take it away take another one depending

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.500 
take it away take another one depending
what<00:00:34.260> you're<00:00:34.470> working<00:00:34.830> it<00:00:35.280> more<00:00:35.490> a<00:00:35.760> standard

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
what you're working it more a standard

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.529 
what you're working it more a standard
temperature<00:00:37.440> if<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:37.950> need<00:00:38.070> higher

00:00:38.529 --> 00:00:38.539 
temperature if you need higher

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:41.630 
temperature if you need higher
temperatures<00:00:39.559> very<00:00:40.559> specific<00:00:41.100> temperatures

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
or on the roof whatever it's also good

link<00:00:45.210> now<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.719> next<00:00:46.410> huge<00:00:46.890> advantage<00:00:47.340> the

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
link now to the next huge advantage the

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.689 
link now to the next huge advantage the
safety<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:49.170> as<00:00:49.440> long<00:00:49.859> as<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.190> nozzle<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.579> not

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 
safety so as long as the nozzle is not

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:53.860 
safety so as long as the nozzle is not
completely<00:00:51.300> in<00:00:51.359> it's<00:00:52.020> not<00:00:52.199> possible<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:53.039> start

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
completely in it's not possible to start

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.700 
completely in it's not possible to start
the<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.410> flame<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.660> completely<00:00:57.660> in<00:00:57.899> starting

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
the the flame so completely in starting

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.310 
the the flame so completely in starting
now<00:00:59.370> talking<00:00:59.699> about<00:00:59.910> safety<00:01:01.489> first

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
now talking about safety first

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:14.609 
now talking about safety first
yeah

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:23.030 

open<00:01:15.619> the<00:01:15.710> valve

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.040 

it's<00:01:24.040> very<00:01:24.400> fine<00:01:24.940> regulation<00:01:25.570> of<00:01:25.690> the<00:01:25.840> flame

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
it's very fine regulation of the flame

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.130 
it's very fine regulation of the flame
on<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:27.490> other<00:01:27.760> side<00:01:28.030> what<00:01:28.480> I<00:01:28.510> just<00:01:28.720> mentioned

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
on the other side what I just mentioned

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.830 
on the other side what I just mentioned
if<00:01:29.260> the<00:01:29.440> nozzle<00:01:29.620> is<00:01:29.920> not<00:01:30.100> completely<00:01:30.490> in<00:01:30.840> it

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
if the nozzle is not completely in it

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.600 
if the nozzle is not completely in it
won't<00:01:31.990> start<00:01:32.320> the<00:01:32.500> flame<00:01:32.710> the<00:01:33.130> super<00:01:33.430> fire

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
won't start the flame the super fire

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.120 
won't start the flame the super fire
three<00:01:33.970> if<00:01:34.150> the<00:01:34.990> application<00:01:35.530> the<00:01:35.830> work<00:01:35.979> you

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
three if the application the work you

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.219 
three if the application the work you
need<00:01:36.250> to<00:01:36.310> them<00:01:36.520> is<00:01:36.790> taking<00:01:37.150> a<00:01:37.180> bit<00:01:37.300> longer<00:01:37.479> your

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
need to them is taking a bit longer your

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.170 
need to them is taking a bit longer your
you<00:01:38.650> don't<00:01:38.770> want<00:01:39.010> to<00:01:39.160> press<00:01:39.430> all<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:39.850> time<00:01:40.030> the

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
you don't want to press all the time the

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:49.080 
you don't want to press all the time the
button<00:01:40.450> lock<00:01:41.320> it<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.780> you<00:01:43.930> can<00:01:44.110> work

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.400 

what<00:01:50.090> is<00:01:50.180> also<00:01:50.540> coming<00:01:50.960> back<00:01:51.200> to<00:01:51.320> the

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
what is also coming back to the

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.840 
what is also coming back to the
versatility<00:01:51.830> is<00:01:52.420> the<00:01:53.830> way<00:01:54.830> you<00:01:55.250> can<00:01:55.460> work<00:01:55.670> it's

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
versatility is the way you can work it's

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.040 
versatility is the way you can work it's
not<00:01:55.940> just<00:01:56.000> like<00:01:56.660> this

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
not just like this

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.870 
not just like this
it's<00:01:57.710> like<00:01:58.010> overhead<00:01:58.460> working<00:01:59.830> downwards

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
it's like overhead working downwards

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.450 
it's like overhead working downwards
whatever<00:02:01.880> angle<00:02:02.330> you<00:02:03.020> need<00:02:03.170> to<00:02:03.250> do<00:02:04.250> your<00:02:04.430> job

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
whatever angle you need to do your job

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.790 
whatever angle you need to do your job
with<00:02:05.330> a<00:02:05.360> super<00:02:05.690> fire<00:02:05.900> three<00:02:06.200> and<00:02:06.350> the<00:02:06.410> map<00:02:06.560> gas

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
with a super fire three and the map gas

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.880 
with a super fire three and the map gas
it<00:02:07.670> will<00:02:07.880> go<00:02:08.030> you<00:02:08.270> will<00:02:09.200> feel<00:02:09.590> another

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
it will go you will feel another
