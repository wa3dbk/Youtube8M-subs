be the world's first phone to have a

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.380 
be the world's first phone to have a
dual<00:00:50.940> curved<00:00:51.719> edges<00:00:52.100> display<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.879> we<00:00:54.000> have

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
dual curved edges display so we have

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.910 
dual curved edges display so we have
seen<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.660> Galaxy<00:00:55.020> Note<00:00:55.050> edge<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.770> note

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
seen the Galaxy Note edge and the note

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.040 
seen the Galaxy Note edge and the note
edge<00:00:56.100> comes<00:00:56.370> with<00:00:56.579> only<00:00:56.789> one<00:00:57.149> s<00:00:57.360> side<00:00:57.629> screen

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
edge comes with only one s side screen

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.410 
edge comes with only one s side screen
so<00:00:58.500> this<00:00:58.649> one<00:00:58.829> comes<00:00:59.100> with<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.399> deal<00:00:59.850> at<00:01:00.059> screen

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
so this one comes with a deal at screen

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.429 
so this one comes with a deal at screen
now<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.020> are<00:01:01.410> going<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.680> see<00:01:02.149> like<00:01:03.199> same<00:01:04.199> kind

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
now you are going to see like same kind

now you are going to see like same kind
of<00:01:04.500> features<00:01:04.860> as<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.100> Galaxy<00:01:05.489> Note<00:01:05.519> edge<00:01:05.820> has

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
of features as the Galaxy Note edge has

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.630 
of features as the Galaxy Note edge has
so<00:01:07.110> this<00:01:07.320> curve<00:01:07.619> scheme<00:01:07.890> allows<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.430> view

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
so this curve scheme allows you to view

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.000 
so this curve scheme allows you to view
apps<00:01:08.970> such<00:01:09.360> as<00:01:09.479> pedometer<00:01:10.080> news<00:01:10.560> sports

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
of technology will be used it will be a

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.910 
of technology will be used it will be a
super<00:01:51.479> amoled<00:01:51.869> screen<00:01:52.079> like<00:01:52.290> every<00:01:52.710> other

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
super amoled screen like every other

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.090 
super amoled screen like every other

according to the latest a report of the

according to the latest a report of the
salt<00:01:57.869> korea<00:01:58.229> which<00:01:58.469> says<00:01:58.680> that<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:59.009> galaxy<00:01:59.490> s

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
salt korea which says that the galaxy s

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.480 
salt korea which says that the galaxy s
edge<00:01:59.939> would<00:02:00.509> be<00:02:00.869> waterproof<00:02:01.469> but<00:02:02.040> samsung

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
edge would be waterproof but samsung

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.280 
edge would be waterproof but samsung
we're<00:02:02.700> going<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.060> make<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.509> galaxy<00:02:03.990> s6

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
we're going to make the galaxy s6

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.350 
we're going to make the galaxy s6
original<00:02:04.979> for<00:02:05.490> proof<00:02:05.700> like<00:02:05.909> they<00:02:06.060> did<00:02:06.210> with

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
original for proof like they did with

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.380 
original for proof like they did with
the<00:02:06.509> s5<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:07.520> definitely<00:02:08.520> this<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:08.789> going<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.239> be

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
the s5 so definitely this is going to be

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.640 
the s5 so definitely this is going to be
a<00:02:10.129> drawback<00:02:11.129> of<00:02:11.340> this<00:02:11.459> device<00:02:12.170> so<00:02:13.170> in<00:02:13.260> terms<00:02:13.470> of

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
a drawback of this device so in terms of

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.850 
a drawback of this device so in terms of
the

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
the

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.340 
the
design<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.430> galaxy<00:02:15.120> s<00:02:15.210> edge<00:02:15.420> will<00:02:15.810> going<00:02:16.170> to

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
design the galaxy s edge will going to

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.300 
design the galaxy s edge will going to
be<00:02:16.530> similar<00:02:17.460> to<00:02:17.640> that<00:02:17.850> of<00:02:17.910> galaxy<00:02:18.570> s6<00:02:19.070> like<00:02:20.070> it

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
be similar to that of galaxy s6 like it

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.190 
be similar to that of galaxy s6 like it
could<00:02:20.910> they<00:02:21.030> could<00:02:21.090> include<00:02:21.570> a<00:02:21.660> metal<00:02:21.960> frame

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
could they could include a metal frame

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.260 
could they could include a metal frame
or<00:02:22.410> glass<00:02:22.680> back<00:02:22.950> or<00:02:23.100> even<00:02:23.130> for<00:02:23.700> metallic<00:02:24.060> body

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
or glass back or even for metallic body

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.500 
or glass back or even for metallic body
but<00:02:24.510> there's<00:02:24.720> some<00:02:24.930> debate<00:02:25.530> that<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:27.060> Essex

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
but there's some debate that the Essex

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.210 
but there's some debate that the Essex
will<00:02:27.870> be<00:02:28.050> the<00:02:28.170> only<00:02:28.380> one<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:28.770> have<00:02:28.920> those

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
will be the only one to have those

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.300 
will be the only one to have those
features<00:02:29.700> because<00:02:30.530> what<00:02:31.530> we<00:02:31.680> have<00:02:31.710> seen<00:02:32.070> with

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
features because what we have seen with

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.670 
features because what we have seen with
the<00:02:32.430> Galaxy<00:02:32.790> Note<00:02:32.820> edge<00:02:33.180> is<00:02:33.600> that<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:34.260> node<00:02:34.440> as

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
the Galaxy Note edge is that the node as

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.880 
the Galaxy Note edge is that the node as
lacked<00:02:35.490> the<00:02:35.670> metal<00:02:36.120> frame<00:02:36.420> of<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:37.530> galaxy

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
lacked the metal frame of the galaxy

lacked the metal frame of the galaxy
note<00:02:37.920> 4<00:02:38.280> so<00:02:38.610> if<00:02:39.480> they<00:02:39.690> are<00:02:39.780> going<00:02:39.900> to<00:02:40.050> do<00:02:40.140> the

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
note 4 so if they are going to do the

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.990 
note 4 so if they are going to do the
same<00:02:40.290> thing<00:02:40.740> with<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:40.950> SS<00:02:41.370> which<00:02:41.670> means<00:02:41.910> that

same thing with the SS which means that

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.600 
same thing with the SS which means that
the<00:02:42.240> s6<00:02:42.780> will<00:02:43.380> be<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.590> only<00:02:43.620> one<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.280> get<00:02:44.430> the

include it on the galaxy s6 so I want
the<00:05:59.460> main<00:05:59.639> reason<00:06:00.090> fingerprint<00:06:00.690> scanner<00:06:00.990> and

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:01.289 
the main reason fingerprint scanner and

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:03.980 
the main reason fingerprint scanner and
that<00:06:01.800> is<00:06:02.010> you<00:06:02.669> know<00:06:02.699> really<00:06:03.030> important<00:06:03.870> to

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
including fingerprint scanner and their

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.540 
including fingerprint scanner and their
devices<00:06:08.880> so<00:06:09.240> Samsung<00:06:09.630> is<00:06:09.810> very<00:06:10.740> less<00:06:10.979> likely

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
devices so Samsung is very less likely

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.629 
devices so Samsung is very less likely
to<00:06:12.120> drop<00:06:12.659> this<00:06:12.900> in<00:06:13.169> their<00:06:13.560> next<00:06:14.130> flagship

divided variant will cost you more
probably<00:07:11.370> above<00:07:11.610> $1,000<00:07:12.570> so<00:07:12.840> this<00:07:13.620> is<00:07:13.830> how<00:07:14.070> the

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:14.130 
probably above $1,000 so this is how the
