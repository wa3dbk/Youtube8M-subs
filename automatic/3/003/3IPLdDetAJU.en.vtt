00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.310 
for now at least and personally I think
the<00:04:16.169> v8<00:04:16.530> r8<00:04:16.950> is<00:04:17.160> one<00:04:17.400> of<00:04:17.519> the<00:04:17.609> greats

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
the v8 r8 is one of the greats

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:44.050 
the v8 r8 is one of the greats
especially<00:04:19.320> with<00:04:19.890> a<00:04:19.919> 6-speed<00:04:20.640> manual

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.120 

you
