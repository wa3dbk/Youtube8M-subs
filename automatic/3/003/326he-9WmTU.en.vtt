24 inches deep in one section is 18
inches<00:03:01.400> deep<00:03:01.480> and<00:03:02.480> the<00:03:03.410> upper<00:03:03.980> section<00:03:04.370> is

inches deep and the upper section is

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.550 
inches deep and the upper section is
that<00:03:04.519> is<00:03:04.940> the<00:03:05.209> deeper<00:03:05.510> section<00:03:05.959> and<00:03:06.140> we<00:03:06.530> have

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
that is the deeper section and we have

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.680 
that is the deeper section and we have
fruit<00:03:06.950> trees<00:03:07.220> in<00:03:07.430> there<00:03:07.579> and<00:03:07.730> asparagus<00:03:08.090> and

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.039

so<00:03:10.280> those<00:03:10.940> plant<00:03:11.269> materials<00:03:11.660> need<00:03:11.810> a<00:03:11.840> little

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
so those plant materials need a little

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.100 
so those plant materials need a little
bit<00:03:12.170> deeper<00:03:13.329> soil<00:03:14.329> depth<00:03:14.630> for<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:14.959> root

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
bit deeper soil depth for the root

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.670 
bit deeper soil depth for the root
systems<00:03:15.560> and<00:03:15.920> then<00:03:16.160> the<00:03:16.810> lettuce<00:03:17.810> basil<00:03:18.200> beds

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
systems and then the lettuce basil beds

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.680 
systems and then the lettuce basil beds
the<00:03:19.549> soils<00:03:19.850> are<00:03:19.910> a<00:03:19.970> little<00:03:20.090> bit<00:03:20.269> shallower

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
the soils are a little bit shallower

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.759 
the soils are a little bit shallower
where<00:03:21.260> the<00:03:21.470> Myers<00:03:21.890> lemon<00:03:22.489> is<00:03:22.640> is<00:03:23.030> I<00:03:23.870> think<00:03:24.110> 36

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
where the Myers lemon is is I think 36

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.430 
where the Myers lemon is is I think 36
inches<00:03:25.070> deep<00:03:25.310> so<00:03:25.780> so<00:03:26.780> we<00:03:26.870> have<00:03:26.900> varying

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
inches deep so so we have varying

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.330 
inches deep so so we have varying
Heights<00:03:27.709> which

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
Heights which

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.640 
Heights which
really<00:03:30.030> worked<00:03:30.210> out<00:03:30.390> well<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:31.260> architects

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
really worked out well the architects

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.100 
really worked out well the architects
positioned<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:35.520> layout<00:03:36.420> of<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.660> beds<00:03:36.900> and

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
positioned the layout of the beds and

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.170 
positioned the layout of the beds and
the<00:03:37.200> depth<00:03:37.470> of<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:37.620> bed<00:03:37.830> so<00:03:38.190> that<00:03:38.220> it<00:03:38.940> wasn't

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
the depth of the bed so that it wasn't

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.230 
the depth of the bed so that it wasn't

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
just a flat plane for a roof garden that

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.800 
just a flat plane for a roof garden that
we<00:03:42.360> we<00:03:42.690> had<00:03:42.870> some<00:03:43.200> some<00:03:43.650> definition<00:03:44.280> in

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
we we had some some definition in

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.699 
we we had some some definition in
varying<00:03:45.810> heights<00:03:46.110> of<00:03:46.770> the<00:03:46.980> beds<00:03:47.190> I<00:03:48.709> worked

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
varying heights of the beds I worked

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.770 
varying heights of the beds I worked
with<00:03:49.890> George<00:03:50.340> from<00:03:50.640> geo<00:03:50.850> growers<00:03:50.910> and<00:03:51.480> we<00:03:51.540> came

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
with George from geo growers and we came

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.720 
with George from geo growers and we came
up<00:03:51.810> with<00:03:51.990> I<00:03:53.090> guess<00:03:54.090> kind<00:03:54.600> of<00:03:54.630> our<00:03:54.840> own<00:03:55.590> soil<00:03:56.340> mix

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
up with I guess kind of our own soil mix

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.850 
up with I guess kind of our own soil mix
and<00:03:57.740> we<00:03:58.740> did<00:03:59.040> many<00:03:59.670> different<00:04:00.090> trials<00:04:00.540> and

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
and we did many different trials and

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.100 
and we did many different trials and
watched<00:04:01.860> water<00:04:02.220> drain<00:04:02.550> out<00:04:02.670> of<00:04:02.700> buckets<00:04:03.180> for<00:04:03.630> a

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
watched water drain out of buckets for a

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.490 
watched water drain out of buckets for a
long<00:04:04.770> time<00:04:05.070> and<00:04:05.570> it<00:04:06.570> finally<00:04:06.900> came<00:04:07.050> up<00:04:07.110> with

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
long time and it finally came up with

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.490 
long time and it finally came up with
with<00:04:07.980> the<00:04:08.130> soil<00:04:08.370> mix<00:04:08.700> that<00:04:09.239> we<00:04:09.930> think<00:04:10.200> is

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
with the soil mix that we think is

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.870 
with the soil mix that we think is
working<00:04:11.010> really<00:04:11.220> well<00:04:12.560> it<00:04:13.560> has<00:04:14.130> it<00:04:14.489> does<00:04:14.700> have

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
working really well it has it does have

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.060 
working really well it has it does have
very<00:04:15.060> good<00:04:15.270> mineral<00:04:15.690> content<00:04:16.260> and<00:04:16.560> as<00:04:17.040> a

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
very good mineral content and as a

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.840 
very good mineral content and as a
compost<00:04:17.669> component<00:04:18.299> sand<00:04:19.230> and<00:04:19.850> perlite

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
compost component sand and perlite

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.450 
compost component sand and perlite
component<00:04:21.450> and<00:04:22.140> so<00:04:22.500> it's<00:04:22.770> very<00:04:22.830> well<00:04:23.190> draining

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
component and so it's very well draining

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.450 
component and so it's very well draining
but<00:04:23.669> it<00:04:23.820> holds<00:04:24.120> moisture<00:04:24.800> the<00:04:25.800> opposite<00:04:26.250> side

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460
