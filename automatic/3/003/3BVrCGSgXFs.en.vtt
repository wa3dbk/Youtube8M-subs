also use him as a dragon so his dragon
power<00:01:08.250> he<00:01:08.460> could<00:01:08.580> actually<00:01:08.729> sweep<00:01:09.210> over<00:01:09.689> the

target and it poisons them for 7 seconds

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.120 
target and it poisons them for 7 seconds
so<00:01:12.479> he<00:01:12.570> could<00:01:12.720> also<00:01:12.900> use<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.380> in<00:01:13.830> conjunction

as<00:01:26.549> far<00:01:26.759> as<00:01:26.880> using<00:01:27.180> him<00:01:27.450> as<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.630> dragon<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.290> like

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
as far as using him as a dragon I like

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.590 
as far as using him as a dragon I like
to<00:01:28.890> place<00:01:29.100> him<00:01:29.280> down<00:01:29.460> gain<00:01:29.790> some<00:01:30.000> dragon<00:01:30.420> power

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
to place him down gain some dragon power

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.420 
to place him down gain some dragon power
first<00:01:30.869> we're<00:01:31.110> just<00:01:31.140> wasting<00:01:31.650> time<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.920> little

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
first we're just wasting time a little

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.249 
first we're just wasting time a little
bit<00:01:32.549> kind<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.820> stalling<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.900> reason<00:01:34.140> for

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
bit kind of stalling and the reason for

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.020 
bit kind of stalling and the reason for
this<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.710> now<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.100> can<00:01:35.340> fly<00:01:35.640> across<00:01:35.790> the

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
this is so that now I can fly across the

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.630 
this is so that now I can fly across the
base<00:01:36.360> get<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:36.960> poison<00:01:37.409> on<00:01:37.500> all<00:01:37.680> these<00:01:38.159> buildings

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
base get a poison on all these buildings

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.100 
base get a poison on all these buildings
look<00:01:38.700> at<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:38.939> poison<00:01:39.329> over<00:01:39.540> here<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:39.750> can<00:01:39.900> see

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
look at the poison over here you can see

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.020 
look at the poison over here you can see
the<00:01:40.229> little<00:01:40.470> poison<00:01:40.619> effect<00:01:40.920> it's<00:01:41.520> really

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
the little poison effect it's really

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.600 
the little poison effect it's really
slowly<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:43.049> know<00:01:43.140> taking<00:01:43.649> out<00:01:43.799> their<00:01:44.310> health

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
slowly you know taking out their health

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.069 
slowly you know taking out their health
and<00:01:44.790> we<00:01:44.850> still<00:01:45.060> have<00:01:45.180> another<00:01:45.420> dragon<00:01:45.780> charge

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
and we still have another dragon charge

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.719 
and we still have another dragon charge
we<00:01:46.229> did<00:01:46.409> take<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.649> little<00:01:46.920> bit<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:47.280> damage<00:01:47.460> but

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
we did take a little bit of damage but

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.069 
we did take a little bit of damage but
it's<00:01:47.880> all<00:01:47.970> good<00:01:48.180> we're<00:01:48.509> gonna<00:01:48.600> fly<00:01:48.840> back

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
it's all good we're gonna fly back

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.770 
it's all good we're gonna fly back
continue<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.920> do<00:01:50.070> some<00:01:50.640> more<00:01:50.850> damage<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.659> these

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
continue to do some more damage to these

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.240 
continue to do some more damage to these
structures<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.320> see<00:01:52.409> they're<00:01:52.649> almost<00:01:52.890> going

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
structures you see they're almost going

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.090 
structures you see they're almost going
down<00:01:53.399> so<00:01:53.700> if<00:01:53.939> we<00:01:54.119> get<00:01:54.630> another<00:01:55.350> dragon<00:01:55.770> charge

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
down so if we get another dragon charge

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.440 
down so if we get another dragon charge
while<00:01:56.369> staying<00:01:56.670> alive<00:01:56.969> that's<00:01:57.210> what<00:01:57.299> I'm

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
while staying alive that's what I'm

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.999 
while staying alive that's what I'm
hoping<00:01:57.570> then<00:01:58.140> we<00:01:58.229> could<00:01:58.380> deal<00:01:58.590> enough<00:01:58.979> damage

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
hoping then we could deal enough damage

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.100 
hoping then we could deal enough damage
to<00:01:59.549> hopefully<00:02:00.090> take<00:02:00.540> out<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.780> lot<00:02:00.960> of<00:02:01.020> these

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
to hopefully take out a lot of these

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.240 
to hopefully take out a lot of these
structures<00:02:01.530> there<00:02:01.680> we<00:02:01.799> go<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:01.979> see<00:02:02.130> we're

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
structures there we go you see we're

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.679 
structures there we go you see we're
going<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.430> take<00:02:02.549> out<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.729> big<00:02:02.939> chunk<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.570> these

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
going to take out a big chunk of these

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.230 
going to take out a big chunk of these
structures<00:02:04.259> with<00:02:04.860> just<00:02:05.340> our<00:02:05.549> dragon<00:02:06.030> alone

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
structures with just our dragon alone

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.940 
structures with just our dragon alone
now<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.540> is<00:02:06.630> possible<00:02:07.200> if<00:02:07.350> you're<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.799> little

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
now it is possible if you're a little

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.309 
now it is possible if you're a little
more<00:02:08.069> strategic<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.869> know<00:02:09.989> keep<00:02:10.200> your

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
more strategic to you know keep your

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.720 
more strategic to you know keep your
dragon<00:02:10.649> alive<00:02:10.860> while<00:02:11.099> doing<00:02:11.400> that<00:02:11.520> but

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
dragon alive while doing that but

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.010 
dragon alive while doing that but
unfortunately<00:02:12.270> it's<00:02:12.360> not<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.540> case<00:02:12.780> what<00:02:12.959> we

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
unfortunately it's not the case what we

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.710 
unfortunately it's not the case what we
did<00:02:13.200> look<00:02:13.379> at<00:02:13.470> this

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
did look at this

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.600 
did look at this
poll<00:02:14.080> that<00:02:14.290> we<00:02:14.380> created<00:02:14.740> now<00:02:15.340> we<00:02:15.370> can

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
poll that we created now we can

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.310 
poll that we created now we can
literally<00:02:15.910> just<00:02:16.240> place<00:02:16.450> these<00:02:16.690> troops<00:02:16.990> right

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
literally just place these troops right

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.260 
literally just place these troops right
inside<00:02:17.770> here<00:02:17.800> and<00:02:18.400> what<00:02:18.550> that<00:02:18.700> will<00:02:18.850> do<00:02:18.970> is<00:02:19.090> not

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
inside here and what that will do is not

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.150 
inside here and what that will do is not
allow<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.600> catapult<00:02:20.140> to<00:02:20.260> attack<00:02:20.710> these

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
allow the catapult to attack these

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.430 
allow the catapult to attack these
catapults<00:02:21.670> can't<00:02:21.940> attack<00:02:22.330> at<00:02:22.780> close<00:02:23.110> range

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
catapults can't attack at close range

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.810 
catapults can't attack at close range
now<00:02:23.650> we<00:02:23.710> don't<00:02:23.890> even<00:02:24.040> need<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.340> break<00:02:24.640> the

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
now we don't even need to break the

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.310 
now we don't even need to break the
walls<00:02:25.030> anything<00:02:25.540> like<00:02:25.690> that<00:02:25.720> you<00:02:25.990> can<00:02:26.050> see<00:02:26.230> we

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
walls anything like that you can see we

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.890 
walls anything like that you can see we
have<00:02:26.410> a<00:02:26.470> clear<00:02:26.710> path<00:02:26.920> right<00:02:27.640> to<00:02:28.240> that<00:02:28.540> and<00:02:28.810> now

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
have a clear path right to that and now

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.360 
have a clear path right to that and now
we<00:02:28.960> could<00:02:29.080> use<00:02:29.320> his<00:02:29.560> spell<00:02:29.830> so<00:02:30.010> this<00:02:30.160> is<00:02:30.280> the

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
we could use his spell so this is the

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.100 
we could use his spell so this is the
poison<00:02:30.700> spell<00:02:30.880> this<00:02:31.300> is<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.540> expunge<00:02:31.930> right

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
poison spell this is the expunge right

here you see does a huge amount of
damage<00:02:35.020> to<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.620> stuff<00:02:35.920> that<00:02:36.100> is<00:02:36.220> poison

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
damage to the stuff that is poison

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.550 
damage to the stuff that is poison

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
can continue gaming that dragon power

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.729 
can continue gaming that dragon power
so<00:04:16.239> we're<00:04:16.359> gonna<00:04:16.450> fly<00:04:16.690> back<00:04:16.900> over<00:04:17.169> and<00:04:17.500> start

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
so we're gonna fly back over and start

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.770 
so we're gonna fly back over and start
using<00:04:17.890> our<00:04:18.070> troop<00:04:18.400> so<00:04:18.549> that<00:04:18.669> hopefully<00:04:18.910> when

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
using our troop so that hopefully when

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.350 
using our troop so that hopefully when
the<00:04:20.410> dragon<00:04:20.830> comes<00:04:21.040> back<00:04:21.280> they<00:04:21.609> will<00:04:21.880> their

the dragon comes back they will their

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.790 
the dragon comes back they will their
defensive<00:04:22.870> structures<00:04:23.200> will<00:04:23.380> attack<00:04:23.620> my

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
defensive structures will attack my

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.560 
defensive structures will attack my
troops<00:04:24.160> instead<00:04:24.760> of<00:04:25.000> the<00:04:25.090> dragon<00:04:25.539> now

sometimes<00:04:26.080> you<00:04:26.200> can<00:04:26.349> do<00:04:26.500> it<00:04:26.530> the<00:04:26.740> reverse

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
sometimes you can do it the reverse

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.690 
sometimes you can do it the reverse
where<00:04:27.350> you<00:04:27.440> want<00:04:27.650> them<00:04:27.800> to<00:04:27.860> attack<00:04:28.220> your

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
where you want them to attack your

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
weird weird base design now really a

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.560 
weird weird base design now really a
good<00:04:49.010> thing<00:04:49.250> to<00:04:49.400> do<00:04:49.580> is<00:04:49.910> actually<00:04:50.300> gain<00:04:50.540> some

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
attacking this when we defeat it but

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.660 
attacking this when we defeat it but
we're<00:04:54.200> also<00:04:54.350> gaining<00:04:54.740> dragon<00:04:55.130> power<00:04:55.310> charge

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:55.670 
we're also gaining dragon power charge

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.340 
we're also gaining dragon power charge
at<00:04:55.880> the<00:04:55.940> same<00:04:56.120> time<00:04:56.360> and<00:04:56.600> as<00:04:56.690> we<00:04:56.900> can<00:04:57.080> fly<00:04:57.290> it

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
at the same time and as we can fly it

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.080 
at the same time and as we can fly it
around<00:04:57.650> the<00:04:57.770> base<00:04:57.890> and<00:04:57.950> do<00:04:58.250> that<00:04:58.460> and<00:04:58.910> you<00:04:58.970> can

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
around the base and do that and you can

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.610 
around the base and do that and you can
pretty<00:04:59.240> much<00:04:59.330> deal<00:04:59.900> a<00:04:59.930> lot<00:05:00.110> of<00:05:00.170> damage<00:05:00.290> with

attacking regularly and it was a little
bit<00:05:14.570> more<00:05:14.780> of<00:05:14.840> a<00:05:14.900> difficult<00:05:15.080> face<00:05:15.440> I<00:05:15.590> might

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
bit more of a difficult face I might

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.500 
bit more of a difficult face I might
just<00:05:16.070> spend<00:05:16.220> a<00:05:16.340> little<00:05:16.370> bit<00:05:16.610> more<00:05:16.730> time<00:05:17.090> you

Menelaus okay guys you can also attack
of<00:06:12.530> course<00:06:12.770> from<00:06:13.070> the<00:06:13.670> side<00:06:13.940> to<00:06:14.120> side<00:06:14.360> instead

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:14.780 
of course from the side to side instead

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.090 
of course from the side to side instead
of<00:06:14.870> just<00:06:15.050> vertical<00:06:15.500> you<00:06:15.560> can<00:06:15.590> also<00:06:15.800> attack

of just vertical you can also attack
horizontal<00:06:16.760> it's<00:06:16.970> especially<00:06:17.360> useful<00:06:17.600> if

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110 
horizontal it's especially useful if

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.750 
horizontal it's especially useful if
there<00:06:18.560> are<00:06:18.680> trash<00:06:18.980> buildings<00:06:19.430> on<00:06:19.580> either

there are trash buildings on either

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.850 
there are trash buildings on either
corner<00:06:20.330> and<00:06:20.540> that<00:06:21.080> is<00:06:21.290> something<00:06:21.590> I'm<00:06:21.710> gonna

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:21.860 
corner and that is something I'm gonna

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.860 
corner and that is something I'm gonna
be<00:06:21.980> working<00:06:22.160> to<00:06:22.460> my<00:06:22.610> base<00:06:22.790> designs<00:06:23.300> once

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:23.870 
be working to my base designs once

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.240 
be working to my base designs once
people<00:06:24.020> start<00:06:24.350> figuring<00:06:24.530> out<00:06:24.830> about<00:06:25.010> this

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.250 
people start figuring out about this

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.860 
people start figuring out about this
strategy<00:06:25.760> they're<00:06:25.940> really<00:06:26.210> gonna<00:06:26.330> be<00:06:26.480> able<00:06:26.750> to

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:26.870 
strategy they're really gonna be able to

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.110 
strategy they're really gonna be able to
utilize<00:06:27.020> the<00:06:27.470> trash<00:06:27.740> buildings<00:06:28.220> I<00:06:28.400> like<00:06:28.910> this

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 
utilize the trash buildings I like this

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.820 
utilize the trash buildings I like this
so<00:06:29.270> we're<00:06:29.420> gonna<00:06:29.570> be<00:06:29.720> having<00:06:30.080> to<00:06:30.440> build<00:06:30.680> around

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:30.830 
so we're gonna be having to build around

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.710 
so we're gonna be having to build around
this<00:06:31.160> but<00:06:31.400> with<00:06:31.520> that<00:06:31.700> said<00:06:31.940> I<00:06:32.150> don't<00:06:32.390> think

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:32.720 
this but with that said I don't think

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.540 
this but with that said I don't think
that<00:06:33.200> many<00:06:33.350> people<00:06:33.650> know<00:06:33.770> about<00:06:33.800> the<00:06:34.100> strategy

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:34.550 
that many people know about the strategy

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.490 
that many people know about the strategy
yet<00:06:34.700> so<00:06:34.910> you<00:06:34.970> guys<00:06:35.270> are<00:06:35.480> the<00:06:35.570> first<00:06:35.810> to<00:06:35.960> get<00:06:36.080> it

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:36.500 
yet so you guys are the first to get it

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:42.320 
as far as we possibly can so you don't

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.870 
as far as we possibly can so you don't

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:43.880 
want to place him right here because by

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.280 
want to place him right here because by
flying<00:06:44.210> him<00:06:44.330> a<00:06:44.420> little<00:06:44.630> bit<00:06:44.750> further<00:06:45.050> out<00:06:45.260> to

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:45.290 
flying him a little bit further out to

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.080 
flying him a little bit further out to
the<00:06:45.500> corner<00:06:45.830> we<00:06:45.920> get<00:06:46.070> a<00:06:46.100> couple<00:06:46.430> more<00:06:46.610> seconds

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.090
