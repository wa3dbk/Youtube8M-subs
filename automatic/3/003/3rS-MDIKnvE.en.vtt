00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.580
 In the middle of summer we are the holidays 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.680
 stand in front of the door and what may 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.970
 of course, in addition to outdoor pool and baggersee 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.550
 definitely not missing 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.019
 a delicious ice cream and that is there 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.689
 now also from northern swabia 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:21.840
 there is, for example Bauernhofeis from 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:24.199
 Moor or just ice here from boxberg 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.970
 namely from uli from boxberg and 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:29.369
 He supposedly has the recipe for the ice cream 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.420
 black knight right here in the 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.420
 burgruine found 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:39.030
 that's the ice the black knight 

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:41.190
 of course top secret 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.460
 we have here in boxberg in the old one 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.940
 bridge there I was so secretive 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.889
 mission on the way to fake 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.899
 wanted in a dungeon in this 

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:57.030
 Products recipe from zep then 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.399
 that did that means black 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.309
 knight and that is something very secret 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.269
 there is only bulli from boxberg if you can 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.100
 want to believe 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.800
 this is up to you 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.630
 fact is there are 14 in total 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.110
 ice varieties at uli from boxberg and 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.090
 fact is also that these 33 ladies 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.520
 with among the most important employees at 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.770
 uli of boxing count because they provide 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.500
 the milk for the ice and that comes in 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.110
 the farm's ice production facility with 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.270
 other ingredients from the region free from 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.460
 artificial additives will be here then 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.620
 For example, hazelnut ice cream is made 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.850
 now with state-of-the-art 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.100
 technical devices 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.040
 that was almost ten years ago than anything 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.200
 started quite different 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.850
 with the first machine it was so because 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.340
 deliberately does not come like the whole two 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.020
 have small schnuckelige machines there 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.470
 We were good on Sundays when we were hundreds 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.090
 it has done so then increased 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.950
 many people with the other machines 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.950
 now always so if it is going well in the day 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.350
 So then do not have nearly as 1500 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.690
 you do it where you sell then 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.240
 can 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.400
 this happens on 23 days in the week 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.200
 then the eight-man team in the 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.540
 ice production to do all hands full 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.760
 so that the freezers and cold stores 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.370
 get busy again with delicious ice cream 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.440
 specialties from boxberg from 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.800
 I hear country colleagues already appear 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.630
 very exotic idea as a farmer with 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.970
 pampa here in bavarian schwaben and that 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.550
 also in boxberg, whether with 14 or 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.370
 to make ice cream and arbitrarily small 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.550
 cool with 20 hectares 35 and so we were 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.300
 not always so with an open view 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.100
 certainly made or in the area 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.770
 foreign internship of nearly 20 years ago 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.240
 is a usa just have that way 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.190
 necessary openness brought which 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.380
 possibilities and with the 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.590
 homemade ice cream had the iceman 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.670
 from boxberg exactly the right smell 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.230
 Meanwhile, the freezers are with 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.390
 The polar bear no longer only in their own 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.830
 but many shop in the 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.870
 region also with butchers and bakers 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.260
 or in retail 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.300
 we realize that they are worth more 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.470
 relies on regionality is coming to us now 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.810
 I would benefit too 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.790
 who know where it comes from the bridge 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.090
 who is behind it takes more 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:14.360
 influence in leipheim meitingen in 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.550
 gundelfingen also sport is more 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.170
 more restaurateurs who value 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.930
 really great quality and that comes 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.390
 so we benefit from the next hunger 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.760
 look out for the polar bear of 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.390
 boxberg and ice from northern swabia 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.390
 enjoy
