00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:03.439
 say 

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:12.759
 I'm here for another biology class interned in the room are the 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:14.069
 animals 

00:00:14.069 --> 00:00:17.990
 I've prepared a question for you to develop during speech. 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.870
 on a beach there are fixed roças nests human investigations there 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.230
 also by jellyfish and shrimps swimming 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.679
 aquifers belong to these animals 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.049
 you know that in the face of the diversity of animals that we find in nature 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.230
 despite this diversity we also have some similarities in that 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.560
 These animals 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.900
 similarities that allow biologists to classify these animals as 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.320
 according to some ecological measures or 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:56.430
 everton 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.079
 and also be in evidence in the evolutionary process 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.030
 It's the same thing if you imagine a scene you go to the supermarket 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.550
 in supermarket you find 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:08.860
 on the shelves 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.620
 mixed products 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.650
 it's hard for you to find that product you want to buy 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.660
 so what is that color or what employees who perform 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.870
 the employees who separate the products 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.719
 according to some criteria then we have 

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:26.630
 shelves with toiletries shelves 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.640
 with cleaning products 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.330
 and these shelves that fascinate 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.230
 you find that product you are looking for 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.109
 like this 

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:36.130
 the animals 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.250
 to facilitate their study 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.250
 biologists classify animals 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.329
 and now you closed reader thus serves some kinds of animals 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.240
 in the animal kingdom 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.350
 but let's find the jellyfish 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.390
 would not be buried 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.420
 this animal is nothing to us 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.750
 and also marine 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.110
 carr márião 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.110
 but not very economically important 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.860
 this animal has articulated legs 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.980
 corresponded to the end of 2 4 points 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.530
 the mammal cat 

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:14.619
 then according to this group 

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:18.549
 several animals were submitted to a recent study of state 6 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:21.219
 How are we going to rate you guys? 

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:24.219
 the differences that exist between these animals 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:28.590
 but we can find some similarities between them 

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:34.159
 with this now I would like that you accompany thus one of the animals that we 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:37.420
 we chose to sort may be so far 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.130
 the table all these animals are within the kingdom the image kingdom of all 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.639
 the animals in the case of the cat 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:47.709
 he belongs to the son who is the cordata affiliate 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.509
 besides the cat we also have the man 

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:54.249
 inside the cordata son we will find the subsidy 

00:02:54.249 --> 00:02:58.419
 that I did subi vertebratta son of the animals that present 

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:00.379
 vertebrae 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.239
 and within the subsidy 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:03.549
 of vertebrates 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.609
 We are going to find the class. 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:08.709
 in the Mayan Mammals 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.989
 and the cat belongs to a carnivorous order and air 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.389
 and within the order he belongs to the family seriousness 

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:21.649
 and also within the family the genus félix in this site 

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:24.039
 félix cactos 

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.980
 watch 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.689
 here is the name of the cat species 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:32.749
 is represented by the first name of the genus to have greater scola and second 

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:33.649
 name 

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:36.559
 is the letter in moscou cacti 

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:37.769
 the species 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.029
 the name of the species always 

00:03:40.029 --> 00:03:41.199
 non mineral rubens 

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:44.199
 formed by the genus and nuts 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:48.340
 So, how did we just finish? 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.480
 we have 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.620
 the reilly knit inside the animal kingdom and after several them 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.240
 and you need to know 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.669
 the main representatives 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:01.119
 of these children 

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:05.010
 within the animal kingdom and we have the ones that are known as wanted 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.499
 invertebrates 

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:11.439
 that we do not have any vertebrae and we have the 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:15.539
 animals can be broken that have vertebrae 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.660
 and now we'll meet some representatives on the thin 12 inverter 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.129
 cries 

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:24.330
 but we have there 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.930
 however injured 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.200
 this animal has the vessel-shaped body 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.900
 it's a marine animal 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.210
 There are some families here in Brazil. 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.389
 freshwater issue 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:38.590
 but most animals 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.669
 in the group of polyphenols that are higher 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:42.710
 we have there 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.999
 group of landless 

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:46.599
 kidney representatives 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:49.599
 the jellyfish which is an animal nardelli said 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.520
 looks 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.520
 sometimes a couple of rain 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.580
 next to it or to observe the vans 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:01.089
 companies 

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:02.669
 the tracks 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:05.479
 platon minutes 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:09.860
 important old man who is represented by six in solitary 

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:14.399
 for human zygo that can be transmitted through pork 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:17.120
 or through the beef 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.559
 we have next son, I think it's a minute 

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:23.559
 also participates in xvi nematodes 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:28.429
 this representative of the end of the settlements I think they will 

00:05:28.429 --> 00:05:31.010
 run the one you know how it does not shine 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.490
 hunter of a disease known as kashkari guianze 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.650
 next child 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.349
 besides Indians 

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:42.650
 note the presence of sarney she is the criterion 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.650
 this ring participates in the process of fertilization of earthworms 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:48.630
 so no charge and gift 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.229
 nothing unusual 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:52.639
 no animals of the emergent group 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:55.639
 presented his segmented body 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:58.339
 in this group we will find 

00:05:58.339 --> 00:06:03.189
 the two sexes in the same animal ps - known as that it was a fraud stay 

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:06.520
 or also a dead animal in the recall 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.639
 We are going to meet the female sex. 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:11.639
 and the male together in the same animal 

00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:14.449
 son 

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:16.080
 these molluscs 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.400
 main characteristic of these animals is the soft body 

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:24.079
 and today this animal you are observing has presented two with the 

00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:24.979
 chassis 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:26.830
 is a very palpable animal 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.050
 another 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:33.689
 protecting the inner part of the animal, the other is secreted
