there<00:00:00.359> are<00:00:00.570> several<00:00:01.050> other<00:00:01.319> ways<00:00:01.650> also<00:00:02.129> in

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
there are several other ways also in

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.650 
there are several other ways also in
which<00:00:03.060> a<00:00:03.179> game<00:00:03.449> can<00:00:03.990> be<00:00:04.020> drawn<00:00:04.790> the<00:00:05.790> first<00:00:06.330> one

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
which a game can be drawn the first one

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.180 
which a game can be drawn the first one
is<00:00:06.930> known<00:00:07.440> as<00:00:07.740> draw<00:00:08.519> by<00:00:09.120> lack<00:00:09.450> of<00:00:09.660> force<00:00:10.160> like<00:00:11.160> a

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
is known as draw by lack of force like a

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.089 
is known as draw by lack of force like a
force<00:00:11.610> means<00:00:12.030> that<00:00:12.630> neither<00:00:12.900> side<00:00:13.410> has

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
force means that neither side has

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.660 
force means that neither side has
sufficient<00:00:15.089> material<00:00:15.410> to<00:00:16.410> actually<00:00:16.680> complete

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
sufficient material to actually complete

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.840 
sufficient material to actually complete
the<00:00:17.820> game<00:00:18.449> and<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:19.170> win<00:00:19.279> now<00:00:20.279> if<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:20.670> had<00:00:20.820> a

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
the game and to win now if you had a

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.390 
the game and to win now if you had a
situation<00:00:21.150> which<00:00:21.840> could<00:00:22.140> arise<00:00:22.470> where<00:00:23.250> you

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
situation which could arise where you

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.790 
situation which could arise where you
simply<00:00:23.699> have<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.150> two<00:00:24.510> kings<00:00:24.930> left<00:00:25.470> on<00:00:25.680> the

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
simply have the two kings left on the

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.880 
simply have the two kings left on the
board<00:00:26.070> there<00:00:26.760> would<00:00:26.939> be<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.150> lack<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.480> force<00:00:27.960> one

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
board there would be a lack of force one

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.460 
board there would be a lack of force one
King<00:00:29.279> cannot<00:00:29.789> attack<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.480> other<00:00:30.630> King<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.289> put

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
King cannot attack the other King to put

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.470 
King cannot attack the other King to put
the<00:00:31.560> King<00:00:31.800> in<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.070> check<00:00:32.340> because<00:00:33.000> by<00:00:33.420> doing

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
the King in to check because by doing

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.220 
the King in to check because by doing
that<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.260> would<00:00:34.350> itself<00:00:34.980> move<00:00:35.399> into<00:00:35.730> check

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
that it would itself move into check

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.420 
that it would itself move into check
therefore<00:00:37.230> there<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.500> nothing<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.040> they<00:00:38.219> can

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
therefore there is nothing that they can

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.619 
therefore there is nothing that they can
do<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.930> game<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.379> drawn<00:00:40.649> by<00:00:40.920> like<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.160> force

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
do and the game is drawn by like a force

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:44.779 
do and the game is drawn by like a force
the<00:00:42.629> next<00:00:43.260> thing<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.520> something<00:00:44.520> called

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
the next thing is something called

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.990 
the next thing is something called
perpetual<00:00:45.660> check<00:00:46.399> perpetual<00:00:47.399> check<00:00:47.760> is

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
perpetual check perpetual check is

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.270 
perpetual check perpetual check is
something<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.750> happens<00:00:48.989> when<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.590> player<00:00:50.010> is

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
something that happens when a player is

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.660 
something that happens when a player is
on<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.879> verge<00:00:51.149> of<00:00:51.510> losing<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.379> game<00:00:52.590> but<00:00:53.430> has

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
on the verge of losing the game but has

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.020 
on the verge of losing the game but has
a<00:00:53.699> chance<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.600> keep<00:00:55.260> checking<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.219> opposition

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
a chance to keep checking the opposition

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.459 
a chance to keep checking the opposition
player<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.890> by<00:00:58.890> doing<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.480> they<00:01:00.480> can<00:01:00.899> keep

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
player and by doing that they can keep

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.619 
player and by doing that they can keep
going<00:01:01.949> with<00:01:02.160> one<00:01:02.370> check<00:01:02.670> after<00:01:02.879> another<00:01:03.270> check

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
going with one check after another check

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.050 
going with one check after another check
after<00:01:03.840> another<00:01:04.260> check<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.830> thus<00:01:05.610> avoid

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
after another check and thus avoid

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.830 
after another check and thus avoid
letting<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.560> other<00:01:07.920> player<00:01:08.340> actually

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
letting the other player actually

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.200 
letting the other player actually
checkmate<00:01:09.840> them<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.380> finish<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.920> game<00:01:11.210> the

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
checkmate them and finish the game the

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.770 
checkmate them and finish the game the
other<00:01:12.600> way<00:01:13.200> another<00:01:13.590> way<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.890> doing<00:01:14.159> this<00:01:14.369> is

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
other way another way of doing this is

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.679 
other way another way of doing this is
the<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:16.259> called<00:01:16.310> three<00:01:17.310> times<00:01:17.689> recurring

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
the so called three times recurring

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.550 
the so called three times recurring
position<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.759> this<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:21.000> when<00:01:21.360> games<00:01:21.840> get<00:01:22.290> into

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
position and this is when games get into

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.490 
position and this is when games get into
a<00:01:22.590> situation<00:01:23.119> where<00:01:24.119> really<00:01:24.570> nothing<00:01:25.049> much<00:01:25.290> is

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
a situation where really nothing much is

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.219 
a situation where really nothing much is
happening<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.880> players<00:01:27.150> are<00:01:27.659> simply

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
happening and the players are simply

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.010 
happening and the players are simply
pushing<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.860> pieces<00:01:29.340> back<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.909> forth<00:01:30.270> over

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
pushing the pieces back and forth over

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.670 
pushing the pieces back and forth over
the<00:01:31.290> same<00:01:31.650> squares<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:33.600> same<00:01:33.990> position

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
the same squares and the same position

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.880 
the same squares and the same position
does<00:01:35.009> arise<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:36.000> identical<00:01:36.630> position<00:01:37.140> three

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
does arise the identical position three

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.730 
does arise the identical position three
times<00:01:38.280> in<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.880> course<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.450> game<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:40.049> that

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
times in the course of the game and that

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.980 
times in the course of the game and that
is<00:01:40.979> another<00:01:41.340> way<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:42.090> drawing<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.780> match

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
is another way of a drawing the match

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.950 
is another way of a drawing the match
another<00:01:43.799> way<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.009> drawing<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:44.759> by<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.240> fifty

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
another way of drawing is by the fifty

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.510 
another way of drawing is by the fifty
move<00:01:46.259> rule<00:01:47.090> the<00:01:48.090> fifty<00:01:48.750> move<00:01:49.049> rule<00:01:49.649> states

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
move rule the fifty move rule states

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.490 
move rule the fifty move rule states
that<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:51.299> game<00:01:51.780> can<00:01:52.350> be<00:01:52.380> drawn<00:01:52.920> if<00:01:53.509> no<00:01:54.509> piece<00:01:55.170> is

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
that a game can be drawn if no piece is

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.010 
that a game can be drawn if no piece is
taken<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:57.110> no<00:01:58.110> porn<00:01:58.799> is<00:01:59.159> moved<00:01:59.750> within<00:02:00.750> a

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
taken and no porn is moved within a

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.060 
taken and no porn is moved within a
period<00:02:01.350> of<00:02:01.880> 50<00:02:02.880> moves<00:02:03.149> in<00:02:03.869> other<00:02:04.290> words<00:02:04.590> again

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
period of 50 moves in other words again

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.819 
period of 50 moves in other words again
that<00:02:05.369> is<00:02:05.490> simply<00:02:05.820> not<00:02:05.939> going<00:02:06.420> anywhere<00:02:07.049> can<00:02:07.799> be

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
that is simply not going anywhere can be

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.540 
that is simply not going anywhere can be
drawn<00:02:08.399> under<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:09.179> rule<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:10.220> there<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.520> one

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
drawn under that rule and there is one

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.300 
drawn under that rule and there is one
other<00:02:12.030> way<00:02:12.450> also

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
other way also

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.660 
other way also
that<00:02:13.580> a<00:02:13.610> game<00:02:13.910> can<00:02:14.300> be<00:02:14.330> drawn<00:02:14.810> and<00:02:15.140> that<00:02:15.310> is<00:02:16.310> by

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
that a game can be drawn and that is by

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.660 
that a game can be drawn and that is by
both<00:02:16.970> players<00:02:17.420> deciding<00:02:18.410> that<00:02:18.980> they<00:02:19.250> cannot

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
both players deciding that they cannot

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.000 
both players deciding that they cannot
win<00:02:20.000> and<00:02:20.330> they<00:02:20.599> are<00:02:20.750> happy<00:02:20.959> to<00:02:21.290> settle<00:02:21.590> for<00:02:21.980> a

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
win and they are happy to settle for a

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.510
