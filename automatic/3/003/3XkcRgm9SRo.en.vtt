00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.650
 one of the topics that most call it the 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.630
 attention to the sailors and 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.060
 people who spend much of their time 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.890
 near the sea or love to vacation 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.110
 in it they probably have 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.240
 asked if the existence is possible 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.340
 of the so-called marine monsters 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.380
 you need to have great knowledge about 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.000
 these topics to understand that it is very 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.279
 possible and that there are many more 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.290
 possibilities that exist to be 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.899
 only myths many of these assumptions 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.120
 monsters could be seen even in 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.880
 different maps made by sailors 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.980
 different here I present the 10

 history

 giant crab this is an animal that 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.110
 live in the depths of the ocean 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.060
 Pacific and the coasts of Japan 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.010
 characterized by being blind to have an ear 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.360
 very developed and have some hairs 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.790
 sensitive to sound waves 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.800
 submarines which allows you to capture 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.199
 sound waves even when their own 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.790
 ears can not do this animal 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.120
 It is 4 meters long 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.460
 this and loser 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.430
 on the famous map of ortelius that 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.440
 he did in the year 1603 he included a 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.870
 detail of what he identifies as the 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.390
 this and endures despite its fearsome 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.300
 Ortelius teeth consider this animal 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.650
 the most docile of the sea monsters 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.390
 explaining that he helped the fishermen to 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.820
 get your fish for the crew 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.680
 it was also said that this fish did not look for 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.150
 do any damage to the crew of 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.780
 the ship 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:40.000
 Rake and the well-known sea ​​monster 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.100
 as hash com / news was drawn by sand 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.380
 brendan because he allegedly landed 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.690
 on his back on his ship and he took note 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.790
 of the scaly ridges until 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.340
 mind that it was not an island but a 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.380
 big fish worth several meters long 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.340
 mention that it bears a strong resemblance to 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.850
 this and endures 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.189
 sea ​​eagle after many years of 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.229
 sightings it is said that this monster 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.420
 marine is simply about a 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.399
 stripe of a large size but without place 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.739
 doubts it is about one of the creations 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.080
 most appalling ones made by sailors 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.180
 from different times it is said that the king 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.160
 paid great rewards in exchange for 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.630
 that one of these was captured and was 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.230
 presented to the crowd 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.240
 Sirens The Sirens are maidens 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.400
 marinas that cheat mariners with 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.500
 her great beauty and the sweetness of her singing 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.450
 from the head to the navel has a body 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.760
 of virgin and similar shape to the genus 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.310
 human but have a scaly tail 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.440
 fish that always hide in the sea the 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.600
 Egyptians compared them with women and 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.910
 birds later the church the 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.100
 I compare with women and fish nowadays 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.960
 this remains a great mystery 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.040
 Sightings continue to be reported 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:53.120
 about these mysterious beings 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.579
 giant crocodile in July 1915 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.560
 after a confrontation between two 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:59.420
 warships's crew 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.609
 winning ship celebrated their victory 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.709
 but after a few minutes they could 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:05.840
 watch as a huge monster came out 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.209
 of the water and was preparing to attack the ship 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.129
 otherwise the witnesses claim that it was 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.569
 a large crocodile that could 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.130
 sink what was left of the other vessel 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.870
 almost sunk and shattered 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.299
 of blog 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.280
 during the cold war the forces 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:22.230
 armed of the United States placed 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.090
 numerous microphones anchored in the 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:28.620
 ocean bottom in order to detect 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.840
 Soviet nuclear submarines in 1997 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.269
 when reviewing and fixing said microphones 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.730
 a sound was detected in the South Pacific 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.530
 very powerful to which scientists 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.360
 they baptized as he bent the sound 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.459
 descends slowly in a range of 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.590
 almost subsonic frequency which 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:46.110
 means that this sound was made by 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.510
 an animal of Biblical lengths as the 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.740
 sound according to the experts was made by 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.050
 a giant animal 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.540
 Ness Lake Monster 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.580

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.440
 called month and is the name of a 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.660

 big and the yeti month and is maybe the 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.860
 most widespread mystery of the 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.200
 cryptozoology most of 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.120
 scientists and other experts claim that 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.580
 the evidence that supports the existence of 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.989
 nestlé are not convincing and consider 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.120
 such reports frauds or 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.710
 wrong identifications of creatures 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.400
 real 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:29.440
 the megalodon this is probably one 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.479
 of the most fearsome monsters 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.310

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.319
 extinct managed to reach 18 meters of 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:40.419
 long according to the remains found was 

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:42.550
 basically a white shark but a lot 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:44.590
 bigger and more aggressive is said to have lived 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.479
 in the prehistoric era but many 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.669
 others say it's more recent 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:51.520
 even others say that he lives 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:54.940
 still very deep in the ocean 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.460
 crack in the kraken is the sea monster 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.050
 par excellence not only because it is the most 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.629
 known but because the last 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.520
 Studies indicate that it is real and that 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:05.770
 today you can see him near 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.840
