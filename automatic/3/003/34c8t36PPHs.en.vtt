but<00:02:56.750> there's<00:02:57.050> no<00:02:57.260> doubt<00:02:57.470> in<00:02:57.560> the<00:02:57.620> fact<00:02:57.830> that<00:02:57.860> he

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
but there's no doubt in the fact that he

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.980 
but there's no doubt in the fact that he
can<00:02:58.280> find<00:02:58.640> the<00:02:58.730> football<00:02:59.090> and<00:02:59.270> can<00:02:59.510> make<00:02:59.720> plays

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
can find the football and can make plays

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.570 
can find the football and can make plays
on<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:00.320> ball<00:03:00.530> and<00:03:00.770> that's<00:03:01.160> one<00:03:01.400> thing<00:03:01.520> that

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
on the ball and that's one thing that

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.940 
on the ball and that's one thing that
adds<00:03:01.880> an<00:03:02.300> element<00:03:02.660> to<00:03:03.200> the<00:03:03.320> back<00:03:03.470> end<00:03:03.740> that

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
adds an element to the back end that

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.130 
adds an element to the back end that
Nakamura<00:03:04.640> doesn't<00:03:05.180> have<00:03:05.330> so<00:03:05.570> I<00:03:05.600> think<00:03:05.870> he<00:03:06.020> has

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
a great chance to not only stick but

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:15.490 
a great chance to not only stick but
