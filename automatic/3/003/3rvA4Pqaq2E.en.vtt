cast-off to Center the Pico over a
single<00:00:52.090> stitch<00:00:52.420> like<00:00:53.050> here<00:00:53.699> normally

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
single stitch like here normally

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:57.660 
single stitch like here normally
normally<00:00:55.570> when<00:00:55.899> you<00:00:56.019> do<00:00:56.559> a<00:00:56.589> Pico<00:00:57.280> on<00:00:57.610> a

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
normally when you do a Pico on a

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.389 
normally when you do a Pico on a
cast-off<00:00:58.480> it's<00:00:58.930> worked<00:00:59.260> over<00:00:59.559> two<00:00:59.800> stitches

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
cast-off it's worked over two stitches

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:02.969 
cast-off it's worked over two stitches
and<00:01:00.640> you<00:01:00.850> can<00:01:01.030> see<00:01:01.269> this<00:01:01.420> here<00:01:01.870> it<00:01:02.290> starts<00:01:02.769> on

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:02.979 
and you can see this here it starts on

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:05.460 
and you can see this here it starts on
this<00:01:03.129> stitch<00:01:03.489> and<00:01:03.729> ends<00:01:04.479> on<00:01:04.629> this<00:01:04.809> stitch<00:01:05.199> and

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
this stitch and ends on this stitch and

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.210 
this stitch and ends on this stitch and
it<00:01:06.460> doesn't<00:01:06.850> look<00:01:07.090> too<00:01:07.420> great<00:01:07.860> when<00:01:08.860> there's<00:01:09.159> a

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
it doesn't look too great when there's a

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.820 
it doesn't look too great when there's a
single<00:01:09.640> stitch<00:01:10.110> involved<00:01:11.110> that<00:01:11.290> the<00:01:11.440> Pico

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
single stitch involved that the Pico

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.990 
single stitch involved that the Pico
should<00:01:12.130> be<00:01:12.340> over<00:01:12.909> so<00:01:13.869> what<00:01:14.110> I<00:01:14.140> did<00:01:14.259> here

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
should be over so what I did here

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.150 
should be over so what I did here
instead<00:01:16.000> of<00:01:16.270> just<00:01:16.539> going<00:01:16.840> up<00:01:17.140> on<00:01:17.320> one<00:01:17.619> stitch<00:01:17.920> I

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
instead of just going up on one stitch I

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.029 
instead of just going up on one stitch I
created<00:01:18.729> a<00:01:19.119> new<00:01:19.149> loop<00:01:19.660> in<00:01:19.990> the<00:01:20.530> stitch<00:01:20.830> I

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
created a new loop in the stitch I

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:23.880 
created a new loop in the stitch I
wanted<00:01:21.429> it<00:01:21.580> centered<00:01:22.119> on<00:01:22.270> work<00:01:23.050> the<00:01:23.259> Pico<00:01:23.679> up

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
wanted it centered on work the Pico up

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.430 
wanted it centered on work the Pico up
from<00:01:24.159> that<00:01:24.369> came<00:01:24.729> down<00:01:25.000> into<00:01:25.690> the<00:01:25.840> same<00:01:26.080> stitch

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
from that came down into the same stitch

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.859 
from that came down into the same stitch
and<00:01:26.740> then<00:01:26.950> went<00:01:27.220> across<00:01:27.310> and<00:01:28.030> I'll<00:01:28.600> show<00:01:28.810> you

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
and then went across and I'll show you

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:36.380 
and then went across and I'll show you
how<00:01:29.140> to<00:01:29.200> do<00:01:29.409> that<00:01:29.590> now<00:01:32.940> what<00:01:33.940> I<00:01:33.970> like<00:01:34.330> to<00:01:34.630> do<00:01:34.810> is

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
how to do that now what I like to do is

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.859 
how to do that now what I like to do is
cast<00:01:37.390> off<00:01:37.810> to<00:01:38.710> the<00:01:39.100> stitch<00:01:39.700> that<00:01:39.729> you<00:01:40.330> want<00:01:40.600> the

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
cast off to the stitch that you want the

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.120 
cast off to the stitch that you want the
pecos<00:01:41.500> centered<00:01:42.069> on<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:44.110> this<00:01:44.590> is<00:01:44.800> what<00:01:44.979> your

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
pecos centered on so this is what your

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.850 
pecos centered on so this is what your
needles<00:01:45.460> would<00:01:45.670> look<00:01:45.940> like<00:01:46.149> then<00:01:46.990> you<00:01:47.649> knit

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
needles would look like then you knit

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.399 
needles would look like then you knit
into<00:01:48.159> that<00:01:48.939> stitch<00:01:49.360> you<00:01:49.570> want<00:01:49.810> the<00:01:50.110> Pico

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
into that stitch you want the Pico

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.980 
into that stitch you want the Pico
centered<00:01:50.950> on<00:01:51.159> but<00:01:51.490> you<00:01:51.670> leave<00:01:52.000> the<00:01:52.360> stitch<00:01:52.689> on

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
centered on but you leave the stitch on

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.880 
centered on but you leave the stitch on
your<00:01:53.710> other<00:01:53.920> needle<00:01:54.430> and<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:55.810> cast<00:01:56.170> off<00:01:56.500> the

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
your other needle and you cast off the

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.280 
your other needle and you cast off the
loop<00:01:57.100> you<00:01:57.340> just<00:01:57.369> made<00:01:57.700> by<00:01:58.119> lifting<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.930> stitch

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
loop you just made by lifting the stitch

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.789 
loop you just made by lifting the stitch
that<00:01:59.320> was<00:01:59.740> on<00:01:59.979> your<00:02:00.700> working<00:02:01.390> needle<00:02:01.899> over<00:02:02.170> the

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
that was on your working needle over the

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.450 
that was on your working needle over the
new<00:02:02.950> loop<00:02:03.219> now<00:02:04.000> I<00:02:04.030> transfer<00:02:04.930> it<00:02:05.110> back<00:02:05.430> here<00:02:06.430> to

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
new loop now I transfer it back here to

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.469 
new loop now I transfer it back here to
do<00:02:06.850> my<00:02:07.600> normal<00:02:07.659> Pico<00:02:08.470> you<00:02:09.250> just<00:02:09.549> do<00:02:10.149> a<00:02:10.179> knit

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
cast that off and then I go over to the

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.250 
cast that off and then I go over to the
next<00:02:33.010> stitch<00:02:33.250> that<00:02:34.209> I<00:02:34.239> want<00:02:34.630> the<00:02:34.870> Pico

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
next stitch that I want the Pico

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.349 
next stitch that I want the Pico
centered<00:02:35.829> on<00:02:36.010> so<00:02:36.370> this<00:02:36.549> is<00:02:36.760> just<00:02:36.970> a<00:02:37.150> normal

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:37.359 
centered on so this is just a normal

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:43.410 
centered on so this is just a normal
cast<00:02:37.870> off

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.470 

and<00:02:44.410> now<00:02:44.590> I'm<00:02:44.740> at<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:45.069> stitch<00:02:45.370> where<00:02:46.180> I<00:02:46.240> would

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
and now I'm at the stitch where I would

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.960 
and now I'm at the stitch where I would
like<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:46.930> Pecos<00:02:47.319> centered<00:02:47.890> it's<00:02:48.490> this<00:02:48.670> stitch

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
like the Pecos centered it's this stitch

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.420 
like the Pecos centered it's this stitch
here<00:02:49.330> again<00:02:49.810> I<00:02:49.840> knit<00:02:50.170> into<00:02:50.410> it<00:02:50.770> make<00:02:51.100> a<00:02:51.130> new

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
here again I knit into it make a new

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.540 
here again I knit into it make a new
loop<00:02:51.700> leave<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.660> original<00:02:52.870> stitch<00:02:53.500> on<00:02:53.770> the

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
loop leave the original stitch on the

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.410 
loop leave the original stitch on the
holding<00:02:55.000> needle<00:02:55.420> and<00:02:56.310> cast<00:02:57.310> off<00:02:57.700> that<00:02:58.150> new

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
holding needle and cast off that new

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.600 
holding needle and cast off that new
loop<00:02:58.720> that<00:02:59.590> I<00:02:59.620> just<00:02:59.950> made

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
loop that I just made
