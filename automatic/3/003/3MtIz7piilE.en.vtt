to the other g1 robot modes you know
this<00:01:19.439> isn't<00:01:19.710> really<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.979> greatest<00:01:20.189> one<00:01:20.520> it's

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
this isn't really the greatest one it's

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.630 
this isn't really the greatest one it's
just<00:01:21.119> not<00:01:21.570> really<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.079> greatest<00:01:22.320> one<00:01:22.740> his

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
just not really the greatest one his

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.429 
just not really the greatest one his
wings<00:01:23.909> are<00:01:24.149> really<00:01:24.210> low<00:01:24.659> he<00:01:24.840> kind<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.170> still

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439

wings are really low he kind of still
looks<00:01:25.560> like<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.829> plane<00:01:26.310> still<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.179> everything

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
looks like a plane still and everything

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.260 
looks like a plane still and everything
and<00:01:27.950> lifting<00:01:28.950> these<00:01:29.100> wings<00:01:29.460> up<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:29.880> really

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
and lifting these wings up is really

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.149 
and lifting these wings up is really
going<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.479> make<00:01:30.630> serious<00:01:31.469> change<00:01:31.829> in<00:01:32.009> my

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
going to make serious change in my

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.980 
going to make serious change in my
opinion<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:32.820> before<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.090> attach<00:01:33.420> them<00:01:33.780> let's

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
opinion so before I attach them let's

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.389 
opinion so before I attach them let's
take<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.170> close<00:01:34.469> look<00:01:34.590> at<00:01:34.799> them<00:01:34.950> so<00:01:35.159> as<00:01:35.310> I

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
take a close look at them so as I

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:37.459 
take a close look at them so as I
mentioned<00:01:35.429> these<00:01:35.909> are<00:01:36.090> not<00:01:36.299> painted<00:01:36.749> these

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:37.469 
mentioned these are not painted these

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:39.529 
mentioned these are not painted these
are<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.890> prototypes<00:01:38.189> right<00:01:38.729> here<00:01:38.969> but<00:01:39.420> the

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
are the prototypes right here but the

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.020 
are the prototypes right here but the
slopes<00:01:39.960> are<00:01:40.170> very<00:01:40.530> very<00:01:40.799> nice<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.460> really<00:01:41.909> like

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
slopes are very very nice I really like

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.419 
slopes are very very nice I really like
this<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.299> lot<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:43.319> have<00:01:43.439> these<00:01:43.560> notches<00:01:43.920> coming

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:44.429 
this a lot you have these notches coming

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:45.620 
this a lot you have these notches coming
out<00:01:44.520> right<00:01:44.670> here<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:44.909> can<00:01:45.090> still<00:01:45.299> see<00:01:45.509> how

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
out right here you can still see how

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.660 
out right here you can still see how
someone<00:01:45.929> hair<00:01:46.380> inside<00:01:46.889> there<00:01:47.219> right<00:01:47.520> there

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
someone hair inside there right there

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.219 
someone hair inside there right there
where<00:01:47.819> you<00:01:47.880> can<00:01:47.909> see<00:01:48.210> this<00:01:48.359> grid<00:01:48.689> going<00:01:48.990> along

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
where you can see this grid going along

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.649 
where you can see this grid going along
the<00:01:49.350> side<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.369> like<00:01:50.579> these<00:01:50.759> lines<00:01:51.179> that

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
the side and I like these lines that

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.539 
the side and I like these lines that
move<00:01:51.840> up<00:01:52.020> right<00:01:52.229> here<00:01:52.530> then<00:01:53.159> this<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.369> where<00:01:53.460> it

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
move up right here then this is where it

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.550 
move up right here then this is where it
contacts<00:01:54.060> at<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.329> bottom<00:01:54.719> and<00:01:54.899> then<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.350> plug

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
contacts at the bottom and then you plug

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.489 
contacts at the bottom and then you plug
the<00:01:55.710> wings<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:56.159> right<00:01:56.369> there<00:01:56.639> so<00:01:57.149> very<00:01:57.929> nice<00:01:58.229> I

bumblebee alright so let's take the
wings<00:02:08.399> off<00:02:08.610> first<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.929> can<00:02:10.080> see<00:02:10.259> that

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
wings off first and you can see that

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.750 
wings off first and you can see that
we're<00:02:10.470> going<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.619> plug<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.100> wing<00:02:11.310> lifts<00:02:11.640> into

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
we're going to plug the wing lifts into

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.600 
we're going to plug the wing lifts into
these<00:02:11.970> ports<00:02:12.390> right<00:02:12.569> here<00:02:12.920> so<00:02:13.920> pop<00:02:14.190> that<00:02:14.220> off

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
these ports right here so pop that off

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.070 
these ports right here so pop that off
and<00:02:14.970> then<00:02:15.680> move<00:02:16.680> these<00:02:16.860> inward<00:02:17.250> like<00:02:17.640> so<00:02:18.080> plug

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
and then move these inward like so plug

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.790 
and then move these inward like so plug
one<00:02:19.350> wing<00:02:19.980> lift<00:02:20.250> in<00:02:20.430> there<00:02:20.700> plug<00:02:21.590> next<00:02:22.590> wing

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
one wing lift in there plug next wing

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.430 
one wing lift in there plug next wing
lift<00:02:23.100> in<00:02:23.310> there<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:24.660> sculpted<00:02:25.050> lines<00:02:25.230> right

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
lift in there the sculpted lines right

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.500 
lift in there the sculpted lines right
here<00:02:25.470> they<00:02:25.680> do<00:02:25.740> match<00:02:26.159> up<00:02:26.489> with<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.849> existing

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
here they do match up with the existing

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.990 
here they do match up with the existing
mold<00:02:27.780> on<00:02:28.049> the<00:02:28.530> back<00:02:28.709> of<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:28.950> seeker<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.879> then

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
mold on the back of the seeker and then

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.520 
mold on the back of the seeker and then
just<00:02:30.209> plug<00:02:30.569> this<00:02:30.750> in<00:02:31.019> right<00:02:31.230> he

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
just plug this in right he

that the actual figures will or the
actual<00:02:36.690> parts<00:02:37.200> will<00:02:37.590> be<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:37.950> little<00:02:38.520> bit

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
actual parts will be a little bit

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.020 
actual parts will be a little bit
thicker<00:02:39.180> mine<00:02:39.990> they<00:02:40.290> do<00:02:40.350> stay<00:02:41.040> up<00:02:41.250> if<00:02:41.490> you

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
thicker mine they do stay up if you

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.790 
thicker mine they do stay up if you
don't<00:02:42.150> bounce<00:02:42.480> them<00:02:42.780> right<00:02:42.959> they<00:02:43.260> will<00:02:43.470> droop

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
don't bounce them right they will droop

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.920 
don't bounce them right they will droop
down<00:02:44.069> but<00:02:44.760> I<00:02:45.000> was<00:02:45.360> messing<00:02:45.569> with<00:02:45.720> this

standing<00:02:56.430> upright<00:02:56.670> so<00:02:57.090> they<00:02:57.270> will<00:02:57.480> stay<00:02:57.810> up

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
standing upright so they will stay up

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.650 
standing upright so they will stay up
just<00:02:58.410> fine<00:02:59.000> you<00:03:00.000> just<00:03:00.150> have<00:03:00.270> to<00:03:00.390> have<00:03:00.420> it

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
just fine you just have to have it

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.630 
just fine you just have to have it
balanced<00:03:01.080> correctly<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.739> there<00:03:02.400> it<00:03:02.520> is

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
balanced correctly and there it is

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.220 
balanced correctly and there it is
that's<00:03:02.970> how<00:03:03.180> it<00:03:03.300> looks<00:03:03.510> from<00:03:03.630> the<00:03:03.720> back<00:03:04.019> right

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
that's how it looks from the back right

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.120 
that's how it looks from the back right
there<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:04.950> bam<00:03:05.700> oh<00:03:06.330> that<00:03:07.260> looks<00:03:07.470> so<00:03:07.590> much

better oh that's a huge improvement I
know<00:03:11.190> it<00:03:11.370> doesn't<00:03:11.519> seem<00:03:11.640> like<00:03:11.880> it's<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:12.120> big

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
know it doesn't seem like it's a big

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.940 
know it doesn't seem like it's a big
deal<00:03:12.420> but<00:03:12.780> just<00:03:12.989> shifting<00:03:13.320> the<00:03:13.410> wings<00:03:13.620> up<00:03:13.769> like

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
deal but just shifting the wings up like

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.890 
deal but just shifting the wings up like
that<00:03:14.130> I<00:03:14.310> know<00:03:14.430> for<00:03:14.880> me<00:03:15.030> it<00:03:15.269> really<00:03:15.510> makes<00:03:15.780> a

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
that I know for me it really makes a

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.290 
that I know for me it really makes a
figure<00:03:16.140> look<00:03:16.470> a<00:03:16.620> lot<00:03:16.920> cooler<00:03:17.220> I<00:03:17.550> mean<00:03:17.970> to<00:03:18.120> get<00:03:18.269> a

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
figure look a lot cooler I mean to get a

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.420 
figure look a lot cooler I mean to get a
comparison<00:03:18.959> here<00:03:18.989> he<00:03:19.200> is<00:03:19.290> next<00:03:19.440> to<00:03:19.590> skywarp<00:03:20.190> I

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
comparison here he is next to skywarp I

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.490 
comparison here he is next to skywarp I
mean<00:03:21.120> that's<00:03:21.360> just<00:03:21.630> a<00:03:21.720> lot<00:03:21.930> cooler<00:03:22.170> to<00:03:22.410> me

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
mean that's just a lot cooler to me

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.190 
mean that's just a lot cooler to me
isn't<00:03:22.769> it<00:03:22.890> he<00:03:23.400> just<00:03:23.580> looks<00:03:23.760> a<00:03:23.850> lot<00:03:24.000> beefier<00:03:24.569> I

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
isn't it he just looks a lot beefier I

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.430 
isn't it he just looks a lot beefier I
think<00:03:25.739> he<00:03:25.860> just<00:03:26.040> looks<00:03:26.390> meaner<00:03:27.390> like<00:03:27.720> that<00:03:27.930> see

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
think he just looks meaner like that see

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.660 
think he just looks meaner like that see
you<00:03:28.590> can<00:03:28.709> see<00:03:28.920> them<00:03:29.010> compared<00:03:29.340> to<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.519> other

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
you can see them compared to the other

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.490 
you can see them compared to the other
two<00:03:29.730> seekers<00:03:30.239> that<00:03:30.569> just<00:03:30.930> looks<00:03:31.080> like<00:03:31.230> a

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
two seekers that just looks like a

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.160 
two seekers that just looks like a
better<00:03:31.830> figure<00:03:32.190> I<00:03:32.489> really<00:03:32.819> like<00:03:32.970> that<00:03:33.209> now<00:03:33.810> it

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
better figure I really like that now it

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.990 
better figure I really like that now it
doesn't<00:03:34.590> really<00:03:34.950> hinder<00:03:35.250> any<00:03:35.579> articulation

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
doesn't really hinder any articulation

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.970 
doesn't really hinder any articulation
at<00:03:36.510> all<00:03:36.660> so<00:03:36.900> if<00:03:36.989> you<00:03:37.079> want<00:03:37.260> to<00:03:37.320> have<00:03:37.470> the<00:03:37.650> arms
