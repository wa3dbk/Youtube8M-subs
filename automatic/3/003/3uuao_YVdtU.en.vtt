guns<00:01:24.030> but<00:01:24.600> not<00:01:24.750> really<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.229> other<00:01:25.380> guns<00:01:25.619> so

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
guns but not really the other guns so

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.310

powerful and mono for 3d and black ops 2
they<00:01:30.689> nerfed<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.350> think<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.130> took<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.340> little

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
they nerfed it I think it took a little

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.280 
they nerfed it I think it took a little
bit<00:01:32.640> longer<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:33.119> go<00:01:33.299> like<00:01:33.689> in<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.900> drop<00:01:34.140> shot

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
bit longer to go like in a drop shot

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.240 
bit longer to go like in a drop shot
mode<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.770> then<00:01:35.250> also<00:01:36.229> they<00:01:37.229> they'd<00:01:37.799> like<00:01:38.040> mess

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
mode and then also they they'd like mess

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.440 
mode and then also they they'd like mess
with<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.520> recoil<00:01:38.880> or<00:01:38.970> something<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.390> don't

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
with the recoil or something I don't

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.149 
with the recoil or something I don't
know<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:39.810> some<00:01:39.990> weird<00:01:40.259> thing

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
know is some weird thing

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.980 
know is some weird thing
it<00:01:41.369> wasn't<00:01:41.759> like<00:01:41.939> talked<00:01:42.240> about<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.659> wasn't

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
it wasn't like talked about it wasn't

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.870 
it wasn't like talked about it wasn't
like<00:01:43.079> really<00:01:43.380> tested<00:01:43.829> but<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.250> was<00:01:44.490> something

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
like really tested but it was something

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.630 
like really tested but it was something
that<00:01:44.909> was<00:01:45.210> there<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.479> did<00:01:45.810> see<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:45.990> few<00:01:46.200> tests<00:01:46.470> and

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
that was there I did see a few tests and

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.830 
that was there I did see a few tests and
drop-shotting<00:01:47.640> was<00:01:47.850> not<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.390> good<00:01:48.570> in<00:01:48.720> black

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
drop-shotting was not that good in black

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.410 
drop-shotting was not that good in black
ops<00:01:49.020> 2<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.470> black<00:01:49.920> ops<00:01:50.100> 2<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.670> main<00:01:50.909> thing<00:01:51.180> was

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
ops 2 the black ops 2 the main thing was

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.569 
ops 2 the black ops 2 the main thing was
the<00:01:51.450> jump<00:01:51.840> shot<00:01:52.079> jump<00:01:52.320> shot<00:01:53.100> was<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.399> main

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
the jump shot jump shot was the main

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.789 
the jump shot jump shot was the main
thing<00:01:53.759> in<00:01:53.909> black<00:01:54.060> ops<00:01:54.270> 2<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.630> was<00:01:54.780> huge<00:01:55.229> like<00:01:55.530> I

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
thing in black ops 2 it was huge like I

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.950 
thing in black ops 2 it was huge like I
think<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.729> pretty<00:01:56.939> much<00:01:57.119> spawned<00:01:57.540> from<00:01:57.780> black

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
think it pretty much spawned from black

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.240 
think it pretty much spawned from black
ops<00:01:58.140> 2<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.469> course<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.710> haven't<00:01:58.890> been<00:01:59.070> playing

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
sure about that man Call of Duty history

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:03.950 
sure about that man Call of Duty history
that's<00:02:03.299> just<00:02:03.450> weird

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
that's just weird

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.340 
that's just weird
I<00:02:03.990> just<00:02:04.619> like<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:04.979> weird<00:02:05.219> but<00:02:05.850> um<00:02:06.200> yeah<00:02:07.200> the

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
I just like is weird but um yeah the

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.719 
I just like is weird but um yeah the
drop<00:02:07.590> shot<00:02:07.740> was<00:02:07.979> really<00:02:08.250> powerful<00:02:08.670> in

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
drop shot was really powerful in

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.490 
drop shot was really powerful in
montemor<00:02:09.060> 4-3<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.390> didn't<00:02:09.690> really<00:02:09.840> see<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.110> get

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
montemor 4-3 I didn't really see it get

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.770 
montemor 4-3 I didn't really see it get
used<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.860> lot<00:02:11.039> so<00:02:11.640> mana<00:02:11.879> for<00:02:12.090> three<00:02:12.239> use<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.480> drop

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780

in mono for three you know I would at

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.120 
in mono for three you know I would at

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
least have a chance in this game you

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.530 
least have a chance in this game you
really<00:02:44.370> don't<00:02:44.550> have<00:02:44.640> a<00:02:44.700> chance<00:02:44.970> so<00:02:45.270> you<00:02:45.300> gotta
