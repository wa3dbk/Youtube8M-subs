00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 Hello, the company welcomes you 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.690
 I will now write these goods for you 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:10.679
 A comparative review of the two models is for 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:13.889
 by 980 teammate version and zopo c2 platinum 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:17.580
 here is the first thing that draws your attention 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.119
 this is on the difference of packages here zopo c2 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.210
 more elongated forging more thin and 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:29.900
 80 wide that's more so thick to 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:32.850
 video packaging 32 gigabytes 16 gigabytes 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:36.329
 Began to get acquainted with the equipment on 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:42.620
 zopo c2 platinum set itself 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.620
 device protective film 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:53.600
 one battery is already inserted in the phone 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:59.579
 Charger 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:06.119
 headset cry and background smell yusb cable 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:08.240
 and a boy with a bundle of zopo c2 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.650
 platinum and familiar 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:18.259
 here 980 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:18.259
 Ultimate version phone protective film 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:27.299
 usb cable headset manual charger 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.540
 device 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.530
 but comes bundled with one 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.530
 extra battery 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.810
 so the differences in configuration, we looked 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.850
 It differs only in the presence of another 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.150
 extra battery in 980 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:47.850
 models so the external front panel is not 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:50.440
 completely different completely identical 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.260
 the back panel is different observe that 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.440
 in the west up to 70 m of the logo is located 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.270
 bottom vc second platinum top so 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.330
 further in 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:04.000
 zp980 us corrugated such a cover in c 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.900
 second, it is completely on the way 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.690
 matte and glossy but without refrain Nastya 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:17.230
 the cameras are the same 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:21.430
 speakers this battery is about which 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:33.550
 spoke the dam version is introduced in the 70th 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:38.230
 also inserted gkb and look 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:40.989
 further difference is so on the micro sim card 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.790
 on standard and on output for micro sd 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:48.420
 card camera and so on 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:54.430
 identical here is the name we observe c2 zupa 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:57.780
 980 32 gigabytes and 16 gigabytes in weight 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.780
 so generally they are identical 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:06.670
 so here we have included these gadgets 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:10.060
 unblock them so the data displays 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:15.160
 different models on the second from the company 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:18.489
 Toshiba display with LTP with a matrix that's it and on 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.100
 for at 900 eightieth is the display from 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.380
 company sharp with ips matrix but 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.080
 visually honest to tell a difference 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.310
 in general there is no naked eye and 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:33.370
 principle of difference do not notice at all so 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:36.250
 Immediately proceed to the most interesting this 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.890
 let's go to antutu to 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:43.319
 view real specs 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:45.810
 device here is the result you saw which 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:54.420
 showed devices after the test 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:04:01.110
 and go into the real information so we will 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:03.590
 look with close so name 80 c 2 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.810
 mtk 6589 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:09.900
 it's quad on one and on second 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:14.330
 installed processor version turbo 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:16.820
 display resolution is the same and 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.340
 come to the fun part 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:23.669
 RAM two gigabytes 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:26.490
 RAM 1 gigabyte per c 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:29.400
 the second version of the camera pay they also 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:34.139
 genetic 13 megapixel 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:37.110
 the rear camera the camera is great so 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.970
 touches the front camera on the big of these 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.729
 models from scratch are also identical cameras 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:48.330
 according to the specification writes 5 megapixel 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:51.060
 real probably 3 well after the test 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.360
 these are the ball you scored data 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.360
 devices 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:59.120
 so on we will compare the sensor 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:08.819
 the sensors are also identical installed on 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:11.169
 two models 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:16.930
 pixelated we observe that in general 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:21.300
 There is no difference between the sensors and all of them. 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.300
 of course the workers 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:51.070
 proximity sensor lighting sensor 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:52.240
 also works like this but we know that in 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:57.120
 teammate version 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:59.620
 ass attack appeared to support the function 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.660
 teammate version is the top version in 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.000
 which has all the functions that are and 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:06.190
 in dams and so on only two 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.870
 gigabytes of ram and 32 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.870
 gigabytes of internal memory 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:25.830
 go in for the flywheel speakers stand in 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:36.120
 principle, as was well and the same function 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:36.120
 there is also in the dam version 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:07:02.900
 here we are seeing what about r r supported and 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:05.330
 In 1 and 2 version window full review and 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.010
 of course will not test gps 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:09.770
 so it is clear that these two 

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:10.790
 models are identical summarize short with 

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:13.370
 those people who 

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:15.860
 Let's say you need the full version of the top 

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:18.550
 all the features but of course it is 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:22.150
 reflected in the value we buy zopo 

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:24.290
 zp980 versions dam full set 

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:27.160
 td 2 gigabyte operative support 

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:31.130
 memory and 32 gigabytes of internal memory 

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:33.260
 who needs support from that but not necessary 

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:35.060
 two gigabytes of RAM and 16 GB 

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:38.870
 internal memory is enough so 

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:42.229
 expansion and January 2 models maximize the 

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:45.440
 there is in the version of the ultimate up to 64 gigabytes 

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:48.110
 also in the dam version here is the processor 

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:52.940
 addition turbo and in 1 and 2 models here that 

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:55.340
 purchased version of zopo c2 platinum to 

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:58.850
 unnecessary that bend slender memory 

00:07:55.340 --> 00:08:00.290
 who doesn't need turbo processor support 

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:02.210
 from yoke and so on just like 

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:04.490
 design your phone will use 

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:05.570
 only for dating we are buying a budget 

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:07.910
 zopo c2 version 

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:09.500
 usually here at cost she 

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:13.750
 significantly different top and 

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:13.750
 Now we use all the best
