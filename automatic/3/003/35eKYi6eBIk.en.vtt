00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:04.009
 installation of tories service services windows server 2008 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.299
 in our example we will create the hierarchy of active directory starting 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:12.309
 of the start 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:13.449
 that is to say 

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:15.119
 percent we will install 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:18.119
 percent a domain controller the domain 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:21.849
 and the domain itself will be inside the forest 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:22.779
 percent 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:25.880
 For this it will be necessary that our services 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.699
 I also acted as a dms domain name server and will therefore have 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.699
 to have static united 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.670
 in our example the server will act as domain controller 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.370
 for all our 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.010
 me mr efe 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.260
 d virtual machines 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.110
 the domain server 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.630
 of active directory is a server function therefore it will be necessary 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.630
 add this function 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.950
 appear assistant to add functions 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.870
 we point out active directory domain services 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.719
 we follow the wizard warns us that it is necessary to have a server dns 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.820
 and proceed to the installation 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.359
 then when the institution is finished 

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:35.350
 d said function 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.970
 tells us that in order for the computer to become a server of 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.640
 domain controller 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.120
 it will be necessary to run the tc promo application 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.270
 percent 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.560
 and this can be done from this link 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.170
 or from the beginning 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.430
 run 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.100
 and we write the order 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.100
 of c promo 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.890
 initial assistant click on next 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.030
 percent and it gives us a notice that we're going to be the controller and in this 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.379
 moment tells us 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.379
 that if our domain controller belongs to an existing forest 

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:18.909
 or that we are going to create a new domain in a new forest our case 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:23.769
 we create a new domain in a new forest including our first domain 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.769
 base of the domain made master domain 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:32.689
 is going to ask us to indicate a bonus name dn sem 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:34.229
 in our case 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:37.229
 let's indicate 

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:42.789
 that name 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:47.769
 pd also from him if the domain already belongs to a forest 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:50.769
 I would start from 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.070
 here indicating the name 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.740
 of the domain us 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.119
 simply stunning 

00:02:57.119 --> 00:03:00.479
 configure the first domain that is also the same name 

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:03.999
 that the forest will have a hundred 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:09.840
 as I say it's going to be the root domain 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.990
 distance 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.990
 the point with 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.599
 this domain controller 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:18.929
 is going to be the teacher 

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:23.789
 and as we do not have a server dns will also act as a server dns 

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:25.959
 and to contain 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.969
 the global catalog is the central repository of all objects 

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:32.669
 that a domain tree 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:33.919
 that way 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:36.919
 all the domains that 

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:39.169
 from the same tree 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:42.659
 they have access to the same set of resources 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:45.569
 in the next screen it tells us what level 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.609
 will have the functional the forest 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:53.430
 is equal to moss to have domain controllers from previous discussions of 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.779
 windows we must indicate here 

00:03:56.779 --> 00:04:01.179
 so that our server windows server 2008 our driver is compatible 

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:03.270
 with functions of 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.749
 the previous distributions in our case is not like that 

00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:11.680
 and so never members to have more resources and more possibilities because 

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:14.999
 we are choosing a pretty high functional type 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.409
 as indicated previously 

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:23.330
 North Nador hates that we do not have 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.050
 configured a recent server in that 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.040
 at that moment, reading tells us that he has already selected himself 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.610
 And what's more, it's going to be the first master domain domain in the 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.010
 it will suffice that the catalog 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.900
 global 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.610
 in the next screen tells us that how is going to be a server of percent 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.940
 and order your will be installed in it 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.960
 it tells us that the ip addresses 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.200
 they have to be static I hope he detests that we have an address 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.280
 or an interface or an address 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.729
 dynamic clear our dynamic ip digestion is the itv 6 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:01.729
 that we will not need it and the ip is not configured 

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:07.879
 4 percent is set up as static anyway it warns us and 

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:11.039
 click to continue the installation 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:15.819
 as we do not have the server configured dns delegating there is in our service to 

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:20.129
 another server asks us if we say continued and gives us that notice we indicate 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:20.960
 yes 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.260
 then it tells us where on the disk where folder are created 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.860
 where is the fifa hosting 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:27.789
 the 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:29.949
 the catalog values ​​it database 

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:33.189
 where is it also hosts the log files 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.050
 and the Bolt earthquake 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.080
 percent click next leaving the default configuration 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:45.349
 asks us a password to manage the active directory 

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:59.799
 after him the administrator password of the director fide and we push in 

00:05:59.799 --> 00:06:02.680
 following 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.009
 start now 

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:05.490
 the process of 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.080
 installation 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.259
 the last screen indicated us 

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:11.099
 that has finished 

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:12.169
 installation 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:14.059
 and we demand 

00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:16.550
 what percent is we restart 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.330
 to have installed 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.330
 all with somoza restart 

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:52.509
 now we will check that we have installed 

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:55.539
 percent in our already domain controller 

00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:00.020
 correctly 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.020
 we go to functions 

00:07:10.119 --> 00:07:13.119
 services 

00:07:14.539 --> 00:07:15.949
 and we have here already 

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:17.509
 that we have installed 

00:07:17.509 --> 00:07:21.280
 our domain controller that as we have commented how its root domains 

00:07:21.279 --> 00:07:23.999
 we have also put that to the same name 

00:07:23.999 --> 00:07:25.759
 what the forest 

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:28.399
 although the most logical thing would be to have done 

00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:30.080
 positions 

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.139
 three different stories one for the forest 

00:07:33.139 --> 00:07:35.559
 and another one for the domains 

00:07:35.559 --> 00:07:37.120
 and with this already 

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:37.750
 hermetic bush
