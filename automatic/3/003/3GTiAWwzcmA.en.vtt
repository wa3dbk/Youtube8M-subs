and the more I play the game the more I

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.650 
and the more I play the game the more I

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
think on this and I feel like it's a

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.120 
think on this and I feel like it's a
definite<00:00:34.050> possibility<00:00:34.079> in<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.829> future<00:00:34.980> I

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
definite possibility in the future I

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.990 
definite possibility in the future I
don't<00:00:35.340> know<00:00:35.430> if<00:00:35.520> it's<00:00:35.640> coming<00:00:35.790> in<00:00:35.940> the

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
don't know if it's coming in the

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.700 
don't know if it's coming in the
December<00:00:36.450> one<00:00:36.660> or<00:00:36.960> what's<00:00:37.200> going<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.410> happen

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
December one or what's going to happen

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.770 
December one or what's going to happen
but<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:37.890> think<00:00:38.190> just<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.520> kind<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.879> extend<00:00:39.540> the

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
but I think just to kind of extend the

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.600 
but I think just to kind of extend the
life<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.230> game<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.680> mix<00:00:41.129> things<00:00:41.340> up<00:00:41.460> a

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
life of the game and mix things up a

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.220 
life of the game and mix things up a
little<00:00:41.760> bit<00:00:41.879> more<00:00:42.210> exotics<00:00:42.690> are<00:00:42.780> added<00:00:43.079> into

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
little bit more exotics are added into

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.840 
little bit more exotics are added into
the<00:00:43.350> game<00:00:43.440> every<00:00:43.860> one<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.100> these<00:00:44.190> expansions

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
the game every one of these expansions

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.000 
the game every one of these expansions
I'm<00:00:45.239> thinking<00:00:45.930> there's<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.739> really<00:00:46.920> good

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
I'm thinking there's a really good

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.319 
I'm thinking there's a really good
chance<00:00:47.129> at<00:00:47.430> some<00:00:47.460> point<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:48.059> they're<00:00:48.210> going

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
chance at some point that they're going

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.940 
chance at some point that they're going
to<00:00:48.390> increase<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.170> make<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.860> where

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
to increase that and make it to where

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.590 
to increase that and make it to where
you<00:00:50.010> can<00:00:50.250> have<00:00:50.399> full<00:00:50.610> exotics<00:00:51.149> because<00:00:51.329> for<00:00:51.480> my

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
you can have full exotics because for my

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.630 
you can have full exotics because for my
experience<00:00:52.020> from<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.379> lot<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.649> MMOs<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.489> in

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
experience from a lot of MMOs and in

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.779 
experience from a lot of MMOs and in
RPGs<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.239> stuff<00:00:54.510> like<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.690> as<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.170> whole<00:00:55.789> do

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
RPGs and stuff like that as a whole do

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.369 
RPGs and stuff like that as a whole do
you<00:00:56.879> always<00:00:57.090> have<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.420> skill<00:00:57.989> tree<00:00:58.230> the

choose<00:01:21.299> which<00:01:21.540> gear<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.930> go<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.320> complement

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
choose which gear to go to complement

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.950 
choose which gear to go to complement
those<00:01:23.040> maybe<00:01:23.729> build<00:01:24.000> hybrid<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:24.659> on<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:24.900> so

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
those maybe build hybrid so on and so

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.200 
those maybe build hybrid so on and so
forth<00:01:25.080> so<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.250> reason<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.670> say<00:01:26.700> this<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.090> a

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
forth so the reason I say this is a

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.210 
forth so the reason I say this is a
possibility<00:01:27.689> because<00:01:28.020> for<00:01:28.290> starters<00:01:28.619> we<00:01:28.799> know

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
possibility because for starters we know

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.100 
possibility because for starters we know
the<00:01:29.430> destiny<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.090> going<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.840> be<00:01:30.930> something

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
the destiny is going to be something

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.450 
the destiny is going to be something
they<00:01:31.290> have<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.439> ten-year<00:01:31.710> plan<00:01:31.860> for<00:01:32.189> they<00:01:32.310> know

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
they have a ten-year plan for they know

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.980 
they have a ten-year plan for they know
they're<00:01:32.610> going<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.759> try<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.000> just<00:01:33.689> make<00:01:33.869> sure

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
they're going to try to just make sure

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.990 
they're going to try to just make sure
this<00:01:34.110> game<00:01:34.350> lasts<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.950> long<00:01:35.100> time<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.880> know

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
is something that I find highly likely I

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.719 
is something that I find highly likely I
also<00:01:43.259> expect<00:01:43.710> in<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:43.979> future<00:01:44.009> like<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.490> new

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
also expect in the future like a new

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.249 
also expect in the future like a new
class<00:01:45.000> item<00:01:45.420> with<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.570> different<00:01:45.869> color<00:01:46.049> like

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
class item with a different color like

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.539 
class item with a different color like
red<00:01:46.290> or<00:01:46.560> something<00:01:46.950> is<00:01:47.040> going<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.220> come<00:01:47.399> out

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
red or something is going to come out

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.670 
red or something is going to come out
and<00:01:47.759> it's<00:01:48.329> going<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.630> be<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.140> know<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.530> next

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
and it's going to be you know the next

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.859 
and it's going to be you know the next
step<00:01:49.829> above<00:01:50.310> exotic<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.060> next<00:01:51.329> tier<00:01:51.570> if<00:01:51.720> you

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
step above exotic the next tier if you

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.899 
step above exotic the next tier if you
will<00:01:52.079> so<00:01:52.560> you'd<00:01:52.710> have<00:01:52.860> like<00:01:53.070> rare<00:01:53.310> legendary

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
will so you'd have like rare legendary

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.440 
will so you'd have like rare legendary
exotic<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.600> then<00:01:54.689> insert<00:01:55.110> name<00:01:55.350> here<00:01:55.430> so<00:01:56.450> why

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
exotic and then insert name here so why

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.700 
exotic and then insert name here so why
I<00:01:57.479> think<00:01:57.810> this<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:58.049> going<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.229> be<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.350> good<00:01:58.560> thing

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
I think this is going to be a good thing

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.889 
I think this is going to be a good thing
for<00:01:58.770> starters<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.549> look<00:02:00.329> at<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.540> gear<00:02:00.719> the

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
for starters I look at the gear the

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.719 
for starters I look at the gear the
exotics<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:01.439> we<00:02:01.530> currently<00:02:01.740> have<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.399> it

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
exotics that we currently have and it

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.789 
exotics that we currently have and it
seems<00:02:02.969> that<00:02:03.119> each<00:02:03.540> one<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.140> classes<00:02:04.590> be<00:02:04.710> at

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
seems that each one of the classes be at

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.590 
seems that each one of the classes be at
hunter<00:02:05.130> site<00:02:05.430> nor<00:02:05.670> warlock<00:02:06.090> it<00:02:06.270> seems<00:02:06.450> like

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
hunter site nor warlock it seems like

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.169 
hunter site nor warlock it seems like
they<00:02:06.719> all<00:02:06.869> have<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.110> favored<00:02:07.770> area<00:02:08.759> if<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:09.000> will

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
they all have a favored area if you will

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.360 
they all have a favored area if you will
you<00:02:09.629> look<00:02:09.780> at<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.020> hunters<00:02:10.319> for<00:02:10.470> example<00:02:10.890> the

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
you look at the hunters for example the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.460 
you look at the hunters for example the
exotic<00:02:11.819> dominant<00:02:12.270> gear<00:02:12.450> right<00:02:12.660> there<00:02:12.900> is

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
exotic dominant gear right there is

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
decent helmets there too some breakers

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.290 
decent helmets there too some breakers
the<00:02:46.890> Lord<00:02:47.130> knows<00:02:47.250> nobody<00:02:47.670> has<00:02:47.850> any<00:02:48.060> of<00:02:48.120> those

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
the Lord knows nobody has any of those

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.420 
the Lord knows nobody has any of those
so<00:02:49.110> I<00:02:49.350> think<00:02:49.560> what<00:02:49.830> it's<00:02:49.950> all<00:02:50.070> said<00:02:50.280> and<00:02:50.340> done

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
so I think what it's all said and done

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.710 
so I think what it's all said and done
that<00:02:50.790> is<00:02:50.940> just<00:02:51.090> going<00:02:51.180> to<00:02:51.240> be<00:02:51.300> a<00:02:51.360> matter<00:02:51.630> of

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
that is just going to be a matter of

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.090 
that is just going to be a matter of
time<00:02:51.840> because<00:02:52.380> of<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.560> way<00:02:52.680> it<00:02:52.800> looks<00:02:52.950> like

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
time because of the way it looks like

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.560 
time because of the way it looks like
there's<00:02:53.340> there's<00:02:53.640> just<00:02:53.820> one<00:02:53.970> really<00:02:54.300> strong

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
there's there's just one really strong

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.030 
there's there's just one really strong
piece<00:02:54.840> and<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.290> other<00:02:55.410> ones<00:02:55.590> are<00:02:55.680> so<00:02:55.800> decent

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
piece and the other ones are so decent

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.470 
piece and the other ones are so decent
I've<00:02:56.490> also<00:02:56.730> checked<00:02:57.060> up<00:02:57.209> on<00:02:57.300> a<00:02:57.360> couple

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
I've also checked up on a couple

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.000 
I've also checked up on a couple
websites<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.230> they're<00:02:58.350> already<00:02:58.620> boots

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
websites and they're already boots

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.800 
websites and they're already boots
apparently<00:02:59.670> like<00:02:59.820> on<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.030> destiny<00:03:00.390> database

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
apparently like on the destiny database

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.810 
apparently like on the destiny database
where<00:03:01.470> you<00:03:01.800> know<00:03:01.920> like<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.340> Titan<00:03:02.640> one

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
where you know like the Titan one

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.270 
where you know like the Titan one
extends<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.690> duration<00:03:04.440> of<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.920> shoulder

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
extends the duration of the shoulder

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.790 
extends the duration of the shoulder
charge<00:03:05.490> and<00:03:05.940> I<00:03:06.510> think<00:03:07.200> there's<00:03:07.350> one<00:03:07.410> I<00:03:07.560> saw

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
charge and I think there's one I saw

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.500 
charge and I think there's one I saw
that<00:03:07.950> increases<00:03:08.430> movement<00:03:08.820> speed<00:03:09.030> and<00:03:09.300> one

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
that increases movement speed and one

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.199 
that increases movement speed and one
that<00:03:09.720> increases<00:03:10.410> you<00:03:11.190> know<00:03:11.310> how<00:03:11.670> you<00:03:11.730> move<00:03:12.000> and

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
that increases you know how you move and

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.760 
that increases you know how you move and
how<00:03:12.270> quickly<00:03:12.510> move<00:03:12.810> on<00:03:12.959> a<00:03:13.050> me<00:03:13.170> down<00:03:13.320> site<00:03:13.590> is<00:03:13.740> a

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
how quickly move on a me down site is a

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.770 
how quickly move on a me down site is a
hunter<00:03:14.160> exotic<00:03:14.910> boots<00:03:15.120> now<00:03:15.300> I<00:03:15.330> don't<00:03:15.600> think

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
hunter exotic boots now I don't think

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.870 
hunter exotic boots now I don't think
the<00:03:15.900> exotic<00:03:16.290> boots<00:03:16.470> exist<00:03:16.950> currently<00:03:17.310> in<00:03:17.760> the

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
the exotic boots exist currently in the

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.759 
the exotic boots exist currently in the
game<00:03:18.090> but<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:18.959> fact<00:03:19.170> that<00:03:19.230> they're<00:03:19.440> in<00:03:19.590> there

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
game but the fact that they're in there

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:20.810 
game but the fact that they're in there
is<00:03:19.860> pretty<00:03:19.890> awesome<00:03:20.250> you<00:03:20.519> know<00:03:20.610> you<00:03:20.700> can

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
is pretty awesome you know you can

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.550 
is pretty awesome you know you can
already<00:03:20.940> see<00:03:21.390> raid<00:03:21.690> gear<00:03:21.930> that's<00:03:22.200> coming<00:03:22.440> in

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
already see raid gear that's coming in

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.320 
already see raid gear that's coming in
the<00:03:22.650> next<00:03:22.769> raid<00:03:23.519> and<00:03:23.790> everything<00:03:24.090> like<00:03:24.269> that

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
the next raid and everything like that

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.600 
the next raid and everything like that
so<00:03:24.510> it's<00:03:25.410> very<00:03:25.590> very<00:03:25.709> exciting<00:03:26.340> to<00:03:26.430> know<00:03:26.459> that

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
so it's very very exciting to know that

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.400 
so it's very very exciting to know that
this<00:03:26.880> kind<00:03:27.090> of<00:03:27.180> stuff<00:03:27.420> is<00:03:27.630> coming<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:28.140> I<00:03:28.230> think

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
this kind of stuff is coming and I think

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:29.540 
this kind of stuff is coming and I think
they're<00:03:28.530> just<00:03:28.560> gonna<00:03:28.709> roll<00:03:28.950> these<00:03:29.130> out<00:03:29.280> over

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
they're just gonna roll these out over

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.400 
they're just gonna roll these out over
time<00:03:29.760> and<00:03:29.940> I<00:03:30.000> think<00:03:30.239> it<00:03:30.360> honestly<00:03:30.780> is<00:03:30.870> a<00:03:31.019> matter

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
time and I think it honestly is a matter

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.800 
time and I think it honestly is a matter
of<00:03:31.500> time<00:03:31.739> until<00:03:31.769> we<00:03:32.220> have<00:03:32.430> full<00:03:33.030> exotic<00:03:33.570> gear

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
of time until we have full exotic gear

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.750 
of time until we have full exotic gear
and<00:03:34.050> when<00:03:34.440> that<00:03:34.560> actually<00:03:34.920> drops<00:03:35.220> it<00:03:35.459> wouldn't

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
and when that actually drops it wouldn't

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.190 
and when that actually drops it wouldn't
be<00:03:35.820> much<00:03:36.030> longer<00:03:36.269> after<00:03:36.570> that<00:03:36.870> for<00:03:37.110> the<00:03:37.170> next

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
be much longer after that for the next

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.020 
be much longer after that for the next
one<00:03:37.620> or<00:03:37.769> even<00:03:37.800> at<00:03:38.100> the<00:03:38.190> same<00:03:38.400> time<00:03:38.640> that<00:03:38.910> the

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
one or even at the same time that the

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.720 
one or even at the same time that the
next<00:03:39.060> tier<00:03:39.630> of<00:03:39.810> armor<00:03:40.530> is<00:03:40.709> released<00:03:41.430> now<00:03:41.670> the

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
next tier of armor is released now the

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.370 
next tier of armor is released now the
only<00:03:42.030> thing<00:03:42.120> that<00:03:42.390> kind<00:03:42.600> of<00:03:42.690> goes<00:03:42.900> against

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
only thing that kind of goes against

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.009 
only thing that kind of goes against
this<00:03:43.500> theory<00:03:43.830> is<00:03:43.980> the<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.239> light<00:03:45.420> system<00:03:45.840> I

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
this theory is the the light system I

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.600 
this theory is the the light system I
don't<00:03:46.950> know<00:03:47.040> how<00:03:47.130> they<00:03:47.160> would<00:03:47.459> do<00:03:47.580> that

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
don't know how they would do that

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.610 
don't know how they would do that
because<00:03:47.910> I<00:03:48.060> believe<00:03:48.299> every<00:03:48.570> 11<00:03:49.110> light<00:03:49.380> it's

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
because I believe every 11 light it's

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.380 
because I believe every 11 light it's
something<00:03:49.980> mathematically<00:03:50.610> like<00:03:50.760> every<00:03:51.060> 11

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
something mathematically like every 11

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.539 
something mathematically like every 11
light<00:03:51.570> equals<00:03:51.959> a<00:03:52.049> new<00:03:52.230> level<00:03:53.040> and<00:03:53.100> it<00:03:53.220> starts

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
light equals a new level and it starts

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:57.020 
light equals a new level and it starts
at<00:03:53.640> like<00:03:53.760> 21<00:03:54.269> something<00:03:54.780> like<00:03:54.989> that<00:03:55.290> and<00:03:56.030> cap

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
at like 21 something like that and cap

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.810 
at like 21 something like that and cap
said<00:03:57.269> I<00:03:57.299> believe<00:03:57.390> 120<00:03:58.260> so<00:03:58.590> if<00:03:58.920> you<00:03:59.310> gain<00:03:59.519> like

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
said I believe 120 so if you gain like

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.390 
said I believe 120 so if you gain like
you<00:04:00.330> know<00:04:00.450> an<00:04:00.570> extra<00:04:00.870> three<00:04:01.260> what<00:04:02.070> is<00:04:02.160> it<00:04:02.280> an

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
you know an extra three what is it an

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.190 
you know an extra three what is it an
extra<00:04:02.730> three<00:04:03.000> or<00:04:03.150> so<00:04:03.360> because<00:04:03.570> if<00:04:03.750> you<00:04:03.840> cap<00:04:04.019> out

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
extra three or so because if you cap out

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.340 
extra three or so because if you cap out
default<00:04:04.950> legendary<00:04:05.820> and<00:04:06.060> can<00:04:06.450> only<00:04:06.570> get<00:04:06.780> 27

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
default legendary and can only get 27

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.900 
default legendary and can only get 27
you<00:04:07.440> get<00:04:07.590> like<00:04:07.709> an<00:04:07.830> additional<00:04:08.280> three<00:04:08.519> points

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
you get like an additional three points

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.250 
you get like an additional three points
if<00:04:09.030> you're<00:04:09.180> using<00:04:09.360> exotic<00:04:09.959> that<00:04:10.080> would<00:04:10.170> only

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
if you're using exotic that would only

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.690 
if you're using exotic that would only
be<00:04:10.440> nine<00:04:10.650> point<00:04:10.950> so<00:04:11.040> that<00:04:11.160> would<00:04:11.280> even<00:04:11.489> be<00:04:11.580> able

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
be nine point so that would even be able

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.020 
be nine point so that would even be able

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
to get you up to level 31 light if you

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.130 
to get you up to level 31 light if you
could<00:04:15.180> equip<00:04:15.450> those<00:04:15.600> extra<00:04:16.169> few<00:04:16.410> pieces<00:04:17.370> so

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
could equip those extra few pieces so

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.060 
could equip those extra few pieces so

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
where does this leave us is there going

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.039 
where does this leave us is there going
to<00:04:20.130> be<00:04:20.190> some<00:04:20.250> kind<00:04:20.430> of<00:04:20.640> a<00:04:20.729> multiplier<00:04:21.359> like<00:04:21.780> oh

that<00:04:27.479> I<00:04:27.750> don't<00:04:28.289> know<00:04:28.409> how<00:04:28.590> that'll<00:04:28.830> be<00:04:29.069> maybe

00:04:29.929 --> 00:04:29.939 
that I don't know how that'll be maybe

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:31.309 
that I don't know how that'll be maybe
you<00:04:30.090> guys<00:04:30.210> can<00:04:30.419> give<00:04:30.569> me<00:04:30.599> some<00:04:30.840> theories<00:04:31.139> on

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:31.319 
you guys can give me some theories on

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:32.480 
you guys can give me some theories on
that<00:04:31.349> whether<00:04:31.680> or<00:04:31.800> not<00:04:31.860> you<00:04:31.979> even<00:04:32.159> think<00:04:32.370> this

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
that whether or not you even think this

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.730 
that whether or not you even think this
is<00:04:32.639> a<00:04:32.669> possibility<00:04:33.210> but<00:04:33.990> I've<00:04:34.110> just<00:04:34.319> firmly

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
is a possibility but I've just firmly

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.350 
is a possibility but I've just firmly
felt<00:04:35.189> that<00:04:35.370> this<00:04:35.490> is<00:04:35.610> just<00:04:35.729> a<00:04:35.849> matter<00:04:35.969> of<00:04:36.120> time

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360
