00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.540
 transforms 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:20.490
 obviously he needs 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.849
 why 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.849
 this is subject 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:33.540
 of color all boring but you 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.370
 inspires but if what we have to do 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.489
 is to give you more joy this bathroom is so 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.980
 sad and can be done with simple 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.340
 little touches without making a change or 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.290
 spend so much money and let's start the 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.150
 color will give you a touch of life and it's 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.890
 very important but we are not going to put 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.470
 paint the walls to make all a chaos 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.199
 a great idea and to solve it 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.360
 perfectly is to put pictures with 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.890
 very happy colors like for example 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.890
 these that I have here 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.089
 and we are going to remember and like this and remembering 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:06.089
 our 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.390
 Oh 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.830
 the tip to give them 1000 and remodeling 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.590
 to your bathroom this is to take a piece and 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.410
 from it for example I'm going to 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.630
 spend in this vase cited milkman that 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.990
 I bought an antique store and what 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.750
 What I did is buy other soapies that 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.360
 look alike so that everything looks like 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.320
 harmony a surface is to mix like 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.119
 textures and colors and also styles 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.880
 this is something much more vintage and this is 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.770
 a vase cited more modern but together 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.530
 they look amazing 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.170
 a touch that looks divided very feminine 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.030
 and very beautiful are flowers that I will use 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.920
 these daisies 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.380
 that look very cute and are white to 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.010
 neither anti erase here of 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.710
 the colors and dizzy 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.720
 They look very good like this 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.540
 and those that remain even more father is 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.340
 put several together you always have to 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.140
 take into account the balance of a 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.590
 place for example here we already put several 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:45.870
 things since it is very sad and empty by 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.720
 what we are going to put our vase cited 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.290
 Y 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.290
 one touch 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.930
 that you have not realized but 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.120
 my flowers are artificial and that is 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.440
 much easier to be keeping it 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.030
 and not having to change the flowers all 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.120
 clear time that your three times 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.580
 natural forward but artificial ones 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.800
 there will be time money and effort and 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.660
 we come from pretty but it does not stop being 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.060
 a bathroom and they will agree with me that 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.840
 the aroma is super important that's why I 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:25.260
 I'm going to put a flavoring for one that 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.310
 I do not cry, I'm a flavoring 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.950
 and not a discreet one that combines with all 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.079
 my decoration the most father is that I hold 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.720
 one that has the same color of my 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:39.209
 decoration because plate has different 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.829
 different colors aromas and then 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.819
 you simply choose the one that is more 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:45.549
 father 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:48.040
 and let him do his job another point 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:50.590
 important is the soap the truth is 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.959
 that hand soap does not look that good 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.310
 nice and then it gets all dirty 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.439
 around 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.760
 the idea is to change it for a liquid one and 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:00.709
 apart it is much more hygienic 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.120
 cutest we can decorate it with 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.560
 different things that they find in their 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.560
 house like a tablet 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.250
 and put a cream 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:19.440
 but do not go throwing your soap use 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.920
 to leave funny messages to your 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.920
 guests 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.860
 i 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.550
 other ideas that make the difference 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.400
 is for example to give a touch of color 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.200
 on towels or a little chat with many 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:49.020
 bent cookies 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.000
 a magazine rack 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.280
 You can also put a dumpster that 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.900
 Follow the style you are using or a 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.900
 basket with all the papers 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.330
 every
