00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.910
 a year ago studio 3 arc half a duet 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.580
 call of duty worker 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.960
 issued a stunning crank under 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.970
 name black ops 2 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.710
 someone spat furiously at 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.810
 Riding with a grenade launcher on the edge at 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.029
 someone was breathtaking from the views 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.919
 sea ​​hotel the fact is 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.310
 that indifferent to this game did not stay 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:28.169
 nobody even hackneyed words cranberries not 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.210
 describes that fantastic 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:32.040
 obscurantism that was plotting 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.829
 campaign the game was good 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.840
 crazy from the final credits so and 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.630
 it was possible to move out of the coils 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.450
 a year passed the baton took infinity 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.370
 ward and what we see with us 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.320
 bitter tears you'll be behind 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.610
 watching a video review of the game call of duty 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.020
 goust from playground.ru 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.420
 Forte series has always been 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.670
 single player single player campaign in which 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.550
 they would never go wild 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.460
 managed to glory well or almost always 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.339
 that we will not find out soon but 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.399
 call of duty goust this is essentially the first 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.770
 game series whose single turned out well not 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:12.810
 a failure of course but in every 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.399
 case, he does not cause those emotions 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.310
 which overflowed with the previous ones 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:19.409
 projects and responsible for this infinity 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.259
 the ward that once gave us 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.329
 elegant nuclear explosion modern warfare and 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.240
 start victorious march call of duty 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:29.770
 according to our wallets 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.490
 But at first glance, you can still 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.159
 be deceived 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.719
 introductory chapter guvd something a little 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.479
 left in the game from the usual 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:39.729
 madness mission in space next to 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.840
 combat satellite causes only the most 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.570
 bright emotions 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.759
 why hide she worked to such 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.610
 little things that can be with a sinking heart 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:51.280
 follow the flight spent wallpaper 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.960
 we are in zero gravity from the death of space 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.420
 the station is breathtaking 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.640
 a suicide attack on satellite two 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.890
 last living astronauts in good 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.200
 sense resembles the very nuclear 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.299
 the blast is not much worse furnished and 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.060
 first scenes on our planet 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:09.880
 the town of the main characters collapses juicy 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.819
 the ground opens up all around 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.530
 cracks and rattles the main thing not to look at 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.110
 parties during the local race 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.880
 apocalypse because there is also sound 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.360
 author's effects are not stingy 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:25.000
 then here with active disasters trouble on 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.000
 rumor they are there and looked side just 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.220
 shake 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.440
 the first problem is all this with nothing but 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.829
 you can not put up in a loud project in 2013 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.900
 years this graphic but u should be ashamed 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:40.870
 which year to torment unhappy and 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.519
 morally obsolete engine hopeless 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.950
 trying to hide inferior quality 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:47.290
 the pictures are even more alarming for 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.019
 developers on which tricks are not 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.959
 Only here you will not let me and fashionable 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:55.540
 lighting and deep shadows and zamylennye 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.790
 camera lens lens unfortunately for 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.370
 infinity ward is a very real picture 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.040
 often and at the wrong time comes through in tons 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.850
 make-up explosions turn out to be a gray cabin 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.920
 homely smoke and a helicopter and 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.620
 even follow their deaths completely 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.940
 uninteresting dense antiquity engine 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.950
 gives &amp; animation 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.200
 characters often slide on 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.200
 the surfaces are dergano changing movements and 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.760
 too harsh yard among the shelters on 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.950
 this is hard not to pay attention 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.829
 especially now that we are used to 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.150
 quality games quality with what 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:31.760
 neither side look 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.489
 the second problem is itself 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.959
 the company we did not specifically endured 1 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.030
 so as not to hurt your feelings and 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.549
 gradually prepared adoption 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.819
 obvious things are company in guest 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:46.250
 bad i'm terribly not monstrously simple 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.349
 bad so primitive nondescript 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.349
 Ideally word itself is described 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:53.030
 primitive and nondescript company after 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:54.859
 introductory chapter by the author and such 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.430
 feeling slowed down almost to 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:59.150
 zero and here you are virtual tyr pokatushki 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.400
 on trucks 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.609
 trench warfare as if we were back on 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.670
 many years ago in call of duty 2 what is it 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:10.220
 why are these questions like and for some reason already 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.409
 wow moments do not go away 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.230
 but not very badly furnished now 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:17.810
 judge for yourself your squad is hiding under 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.060
 water burst from the destroyed dam 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.970
 around the noise something collapses picture 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:26.180
 rumbles a few seconds later to 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.570
 again sad virtual shooting and so on 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.770
 the very final 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.199
 multiplayer echoes the company in its 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.300
 inconspicuous and no his language is no longer 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:37.190
 turn to call bad but he just 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.139
 no curious mode is there 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.449
 Needless to say, spend a few here. 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.520
 evenings will be able to stay but 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:46.190
 for a long time for some reason there is no desire 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.919
 deep customization of the character for a while 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.020
 distracts from the obvious minuses but if 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:53.240
 black ops 2 network battles captured 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.699
 without regard to the situation in Goust 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.220
 the opposite weapon shoots worse 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:01.130
 airsoft ears almost expire 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.500
 blood from plastic sounds playing 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:07.400
 arenas such sensations have become even smaller 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:10.070
 even worse and more crowded than bright 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.960
 scale and frantic struggles of beauty 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.110
 black ops 2 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:17.000
 answer in black ops 2 all this is left 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:19.669
 perhaps 3 ark finally got 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.520
 status of the best developer of the series that is not 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:25.370
 prevented and yes and hardly interfered 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.630
 the publisher rip off the huge jackpot and on 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.770
 selling copies of the game 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:33.320
 And still in the game there is a sad dog 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.449
 stealth you remotely control the correct 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.970
 a doggie that gnaws fiercely 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:39.440
 opponents and located 5 meters from 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.560
 this enemies do not pay any 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.240
 attention to the fallen comrade then they 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.669
 can even walk in the place where 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.710
 as the doggie intuition suggests 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:51.830
 left the phone someone raises the alarm 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.389
 on and if add with perfectly 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.370
 ridiculous sounds of firing weapons 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:57.710
 get the impression you're shooting 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.510
 rather from a fountain pen on the other hand 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.449
 there are amazing loading screens 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:04.190
 between story missions that are cinema 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:04.729
 Phil will remind the opening credits to 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.520
 remake 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:08.870
 dragon tattooed girls have narrow 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.419
 level corridors for which on 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:14.389
 Diligently do not release glued to 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:16.280
 earth boxes and blurred texture and has 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:19.010
 wonderfully networked alien mode 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:21.470
 which is bought and reckless you 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:23.870
 the whole game is built on these 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:26.090
 contradictions something good yes yes bad 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.599
 and the overall picture is balanced by all the pros and 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.599
 vs 

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:32.210
 call of duty voice releases the frame of the series 

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:34.909
 up to indecent normal level sorry 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:37.070
 for the mediocre vocabulary of a strong middling 

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:39.580
 Is this what we expected from one of the best 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:42.139
 game action movies of our time 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:44.889
 Thank you for your attention and see you on
