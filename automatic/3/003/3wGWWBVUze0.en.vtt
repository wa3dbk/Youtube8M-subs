00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
think it's a really good map for it you

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.870 
think it's a really good map for it you
just<00:00:12.990> basically<00:00:13.200> want<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:14.190> get<00:00:14.309> spy<00:00:14.490> plane<00:00:14.730> up

just basically want to get spy plane up
just<00:00:15.570> look<00:00:15.719> for<00:00:15.780> an<00:00:15.929> area<00:00:16.199> where<00:00:16.320> people<00:00:16.350> are

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
just look for an area where people are

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.590

grenade or something in there and the

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:21.500 
grenade or something in there and the
reason<00:00:20.760> i'm<00:00:20.910> trying<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:21.150> get<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.330> pro<00:00:21.480> version

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
reason i'm trying to get the pro version

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.900 
reason i'm trying to get the pro version
so<00:00:21.960> much<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.289> because<00:00:22.550> what<00:00:23.550> it<00:00:23.640> does<00:00:23.670> is<00:00:23.880> it

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
so much is because what it does is it

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.340 
so much is because what it does is it
reveals<00:00:24.300> people<00:00:24.630> in<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.779> mini-map<00:00:25.080> when

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
reveals people in the mini-map when

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.660 
reveals people in the mini-map when
they're<00:00:25.529> stunned<00:00:25.830> or<00:00:26.070> affected<00:00:26.460> by<00:00:26.580> your

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
they're stunned or affected by your

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.960 
they're stunned or affected by your
special<00:00:27.029> grenade<00:00:27.769> which<00:00:28.769> is<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.849> know<00:00:29.939> i

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
special grenade which is a you know i

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.279 
special grenade which is a you know i
can<00:00:30.150> imagine<00:00:30.300> that<00:00:30.449> being<00:00:30.630> extremely<00:00:31.050> useful

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
can imagine that being extremely useful

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.260 
can imagine that being extremely useful
especially<00:00:32.099> when<00:00:32.489> you've<00:00:32.579> got<00:00:32.669> that<00:00:32.730> one<00:00:32.880> guy

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
especially when you've got that one guy

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.240 
especially when you've got that one guy
he<00:00:33.300> just<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:34.140> constantly<00:00:34.710> camping<00:00:35.070> in<00:00:35.160> this

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
he just is constantly camping in this

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.150 
he just is constantly camping in this
one<00:00:35.399> corner<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.760> them<00:00:35.910> up<00:00:36.030> in<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.510> other<00:00:36.899> map

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
one corner of them up in the other map

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.229 
one corner of them up in the other map
that's<00:00:38.160> what<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.340> flashbangs<00:00:38.790> before<00:00:39.059> really

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
that's what the flashbangs before really

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.580 
that's what the flashbangs before really
nova<00:00:42.239> gas<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.540> pretty<00:00:42.750> hard<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:42.930> get<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.230> those

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
nova gas is pretty hard to get the those

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.529 
nova gas is pretty hard to get the those
challenges<00:00:43.980> on<00:00:44.100> though<00:00:44.250> because<00:00:44.399> they<00:00:45.300> got<00:00:45.450> to

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
challenges on though because they got to

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.000 
challenges on though because they got to
be<00:00:45.600> pretty<00:00:45.750> close<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.350> gas<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.770> actually

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
be pretty close to the gas to actually

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.010 
be pretty close to the gas to actually
be<00:00:47.129> affected<00:00:47.550> by<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:48.660> lot<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.809> people

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
be affected by it and a lot of people

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.400 
be affected by it and a lot of people
are<00:00:49.079> still<00:00:49.260> running<00:00:49.379> tactical<00:00:49.710> mask<00:00:51.410> even

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
are still running tactical mask even

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.189 
are still running tactical mask even

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
though it only like the first part of

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.260 
though it only like the first part of
tactical<00:00:55.530> mask<00:00:55.710> only<00:00:56.070> shield<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.520> from<00:00:56.550> Nova

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
tactical mask only shield you from Nova

tactical mask only shield you from Nova
gas<00:00:57.649> and<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:59.100> be<00:00:59.160> honest<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.430> I've<00:00:59.520> see<00:00:59.670> that

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
gas and to be honest that I've see that

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.619 
gas and to be honest that I've see that
much<00:00:59.910> of<00:00:59.940> Nova<00:01:00.210> gas<00:01:00.359> going<00:01:00.600> around<00:01:01.129> but<00:01:02.629> yeah

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
much of Nova gas going around but yeah

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:04.820 
much of Nova gas going around but yeah
seems<00:01:03.899> while<00:01:04.049> people<00:01:04.290> still<00:01:04.500> running<00:01:04.739> the

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
seems while people still running the

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.179 
seems while people still running the
tactical<00:01:05.189> mask<00:01:05.369> which<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.610> weird<00:01:05.909> but<00:01:07.100> it's<00:01:08.100> a

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
tactical mask which is weird but it's a

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.320 
tactical mask which is weird but it's a
good<00:01:08.310> perk<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.700> know<00:01:08.790> it's<00:01:09.030> not<00:01:09.150> bad

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
good perk you know it's not bad

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.080 
good perk you know it's not bad
especially<00:01:09.570> once<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.020> get<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.229> pro<00:01:11.090> the

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
especially once you get the pro the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.760 
especially once you get the pro the
player<00:01:12.360> who<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.570> in<00:01:12.840> first<00:01:13.020> place<00:01:13.170> appears<00:01:13.650> as

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
player who is in first place appears as

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.200

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
that's what it is I was thinking there

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.039 
that's what it is I was thinking there
was<00:01:17.610> like<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.759> green<00:01:18.060> dot<00:01:18.299> mixed<00:01:18.659> with<00:01:18.810> them<00:01:18.930> or

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
was like a green dot mixed with them or

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:27.020 
was like a green dot mixed with them or
something<00:01:22.130> hmm<00:01:23.130> kind<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.180> encourages<00:01:24.720> there

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.090 

not<00:01:27.869> too<00:01:28.049> sure<00:01:28.260> about<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.650> little

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
not too sure about that little

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.190
