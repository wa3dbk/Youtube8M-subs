00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
hi this video is to help you to add

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.070 
hi this video is to help you to add
negative<00:00:05.100> numbers<00:00:05.430> successfully<00:00:06.120> this<00:00:06.960> is<00:00:07.049> a

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
negative numbers successfully this is a

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.570 
negative numbers successfully this is a
topic<00:00:07.379> that<00:00:07.500> everybody<00:00:07.980> has<00:00:08.340> a<00:00:08.370> lot<00:00:08.550> of

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
topic that everybody has a lot of

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.589 
topic that everybody has a lot of
quickly<00:00:09.030> with<00:00:09.230> and<00:00:10.340> you<00:00:11.340> know<00:00:11.490> it<00:00:11.759> really<00:00:12.360> pays

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
quickly with and you know it really pays

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.870 
quickly with and you know it really pays
I<00:00:12.630> think<00:00:12.990> just<00:00:13.139> have<00:00:13.380> a<00:00:13.530> really<00:00:13.950> clear<00:00:14.400> idea<00:00:14.639> of

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
I think just have a really clear idea of

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.160 
I think just have a really clear idea of
what<00:00:15.000> you're<00:00:15.120> gonna<00:00:15.210> do<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.630> try<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:15.990> fix

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
what you're gonna do and try and fix

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.029 
what you're gonna do and try and fix
just<00:00:16.410> one<00:00:16.800> possible<00:00:17.730> method<00:00:17.910> into<00:00:18.840> your<00:00:18.960> mind

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
just one possible method into your mind

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.650 
just one possible method into your mind
there<00:00:20.609> are<00:00:20.789> lots<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.300> lots<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.570> different

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
there are lots and lots of different

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.150 
there are lots and lots of different
ways<00:00:21.960> that<00:00:21.990> you<00:00:22.230> can<00:00:22.560> think<00:00:22.800> about<00:00:23.010> negative

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
ways that you can think about negative

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.070 
ways that you can think about negative
numbers<00:00:23.369> but<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:24.390> think<00:00:24.660> when<00:00:24.750> you're<00:00:24.840> adding

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
numbers but I think when you're adding

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.779 
numbers but I think when you're adding
and<00:00:25.320> subtracting<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:26.039> most<00:00:26.220> sort<00:00:26.760> of

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
and subtracting the most sort of

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.400 
and subtracting the most sort of
powerful<00:00:27.269> way<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:27.420> you<00:00:27.630> can<00:00:27.779> do<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.170> just

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
powerful way that you can do it is just

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.620 
powerful way that you can do it is just
you<00:00:28.619> simply<00:00:29.070> use<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.490> number<00:00:30.029> line<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.359> as<00:00:30.480> you

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
you simply use a number line and as you

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.299 
you simply use a number line and as you
get<00:00:31.199> better<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.560> better<00:00:31.619> at<00:00:31.830> doing<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.189> you'll

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
get better and better at doing it you'll

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.490 
get better and better at doing it you'll
do<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:32.579> in<00:00:32.610> your<00:00:32.700> head<00:00:32.940> rather<00:00:33.270> than<00:00:33.510> actually

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
do it in your head rather than actually

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.979 
do it in your head rather than actually
on<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.590> piece<00:00:34.770> of<00:00:34.800> paper<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.480> the<00:00:36.480> key<00:00:36.690> thing

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
on a piece of paper and the key thing

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.729 
on a piece of paper and the key thing
about<00:00:37.200> negative<00:00:37.980> numbers<00:00:38.340> is<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:39.500> if<00:00:40.500> you're

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
about negative numbers is that if you're

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.950 
about negative numbers is that if you're
working<00:00:40.770> with<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.399> number<00:00:41.640> line<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.450> normal

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
working with a number line the normal

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.610 
working with a number line the normal
direction<00:00:43.530> when<00:00:43.649> you're<00:00:43.800> adding<00:00:44.690> is<00:00:45.690> to

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
direction when you're adding is to

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.950 
direction when you're adding is to
travel<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.100> this<00:00:47.219> direction<00:00:47.629> but<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.750> rule

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
travel in this direction but the rule

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.660 
travel in this direction but the rule
that<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.200> want<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.710> remember<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.489> if

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
that I want you to remember is that if

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.750 
that I want you to remember is that if
you're<00:00:50.820> going<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.800> add<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.890> negative<00:00:53.309> number

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
you're going to add a negative number

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.930 
you're going to add a negative number
it's<00:00:54.090> going<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.510> change<00:00:54.960> direction<00:00:55.739> okay<00:00:56.699> I'll

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
it's going to change direction okay I'll

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.049 
it's going to change direction okay I'll
show<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.300> what<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.510> mean<00:00:59.270> so<00:01:00.270> here<00:01:01.730> we'll<00:01:02.730> start

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
show you what I mean so here we'll start

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.109 
show you what I mean so here we'll start
with<00:01:03.270> 8<00:01:04.140> plus<00:01:05.510> negative<00:01:06.510> 3<00:01:07.280> okay<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:09.000> way

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
with 8 plus negative 3 okay and the way

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.880 
with 8 plus negative 3 okay and the way
that<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.299> like<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.720> think<00:01:09.900> about<00:01:10.080> this<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.500> as

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
that I like to think about this is as

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.670 
that I like to think about this is as
being<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.520> sort<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.760> start<00:01:12.720> position<00:01:13.380> I'm

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
being the sort of start position I'm

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.050 
being the sort of start position I'm
just<00:01:13.830> kind<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.100> triangle<00:01:14.430> around<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.909> one

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
just kind of a triangle around that one

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.550 
just kind of a triangle around that one
that's<00:01:15.600> going<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.810> be<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.110> place<00:01:16.320> where<00:01:16.350> we

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
that's going to be the place where we

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.910 
that's going to be the place where we
start<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:18.060> number<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.689> going<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.470> be<00:01:19.650> the

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
start and this number is going to be the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.469 
start and this number is going to be the
thing<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.280> we're<00:01:20.400> going<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.610> add<00:01:20.790> on<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.360> it

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
thing that we're going to add on to it

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.580 
thing that we're going to add on to it
all<00:01:22.290> right

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
all right

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.410 
all right
so<00:01:23.189> we're<00:01:23.340> going<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.490> start<00:01:23.850> at<00:01:24.090> 8<00:01:25.189> here<00:01:26.189> and

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
so we're going to start at 8 here and

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.969 
so we're going to start at 8 here and
normally<00:01:27.420> because<00:01:27.930> this<00:01:28.080> symbol<00:01:28.560> here<00:01:28.770> says

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
normally because this symbol here says

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.340 
normally because this symbol here says
adding<00:01:29.520> normally<00:01:30.420> we<00:01:30.600> would<00:01:30.780> be<00:01:30.930> going<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.320> the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
adding normally we would be going to the

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.130 
adding normally we would be going to the
right<00:01:31.500> we'd<00:01:32.250> be<00:01:32.400> adding<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:33.479> we'd<00:01:33.600> be<00:01:33.689> starting

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
right we'd be adding so we'd be starting

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.960 
right we'd be adding so we'd be starting
at<00:01:34.229> 8<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.590> we'd<00:01:34.710> be<00:01:34.799> trying<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.159> hop<00:01:35.340> on<00:01:35.549> this

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
at 8 and we'd be trying to hop on this

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.069 
at 8 and we'd be trying to hop on this
way<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:37.020> get<00:01:37.170> bigger<00:01:37.439> but<00:01:38.340> hold<00:01:38.670> on<00:01:38.930> we<00:01:39.930> are

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
way to get bigger but hold on we are

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.679 
way to get bigger but hold on we are
adding<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.829> negative<00:01:41.640> number<00:01:43.850> so<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.000> changes

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
adding a negative number so it changes

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.020 
adding a negative number so it changes
direction<00:01:48.680> okay<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.920> instead<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.610> going<00:01:50.880> to

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
direction okay and instead of going to

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.480 
direction okay and instead of going to
the<00:01:51.270> right<00:01:51.630> like<00:01:52.320> this<00:01:52.530> instead<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:53.040> going<00:01:53.280> one

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
the right like this instead of going one

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.190 
the right like this instead of going one
two<00:01:53.850> three<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.509> getting<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.840> answer<00:01:55.079> of

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
two three and getting the answer of

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.249 
two three and getting the answer of
eleven<00:01:55.619> we're<00:01:56.399> instead<00:01:56.820> going<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.180> go<00:01:57.329> one<00:01:57.990> two

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
eleven we're instead going to go one two

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.709 
eleven we're instead going to go one two
three<00:01:59.100> like<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.729> so<00:02:00.000> let's<00:02:00.210> just<00:02:00.270> put<00:02:00.570> those

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
three like that so let's just put those

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.399 
three like that so let's just put those
on<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:00.990> one<00:02:01.439> two<00:02:02.210> three<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.689> if<00:02:04.020> we<00:02:04.170> count

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
on that one two three and if we count

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.770 
on that one two three and if we count
down<00:02:04.560> six<00:02:05.100> seven<00:02:05.630> six

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
down six seven six

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.570 
down six seven six
we<00:02:07.590> get<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.920> five<00:02:08.220> so<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.209> answer

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
we get to five so the answer

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.460 
we get to five so the answer
is<00:02:12.740> 5/8<00:02:13.740> ad<00:02:14.100> negative<00:02:15.000> three<00:02:15.390> is<00:02:16.110> equal<00:02:16.230> to

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
is 5/8 ad negative three is equal to

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.110 
is 5/8 ad negative three is equal to
five<00:02:18.230> okay<00:02:19.230> if<00:02:19.350> we<00:02:19.500> have<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.650> look<00:02:19.860> at<00:02:20.130> another

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
five okay if we have a look at another

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.820 
five okay if we have a look at another
one<00:02:21.330> now<00:02:21.740> okay<00:02:22.740> we're<00:02:23.010> gonna<00:02:23.160> start<00:02:23.550> with<00:02:23.790> our

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
one now okay we're gonna start with our

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.980 
one now okay we're gonna start with our
number<00:02:25.830> line<00:02:25.910> and<00:02:26.910> this<00:02:27.540> time<00:02:27.750> we're<00:02:27.900> gonna

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
number line and this time we're gonna

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:34.449 
number line and this time we're gonna
have<00:02:28.340> seven<00:02:29.959> add<00:02:31.400> negative<00:02:32.540> 15

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
have seven add negative 15

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.240 
have seven add negative 15
okay<00:02:35.459> so<00:02:36.150> again<00:02:36.270> the<00:02:36.570> first<00:02:36.930> number<00:02:37.470> is<00:02:38.040> where

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
okay so again the first number is where

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.850 
okay so again the first number is where
you<00:02:38.340> start<00:02:38.670> on<00:02:38.790> your<00:02:38.910> number<00:02:39.180> line<00:02:39.740> here's<00:02:40.740> the

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
you start on your number line here's the

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.460 
you start on your number line here's the
seven<00:02:42.080> we're<00:02:43.080> going<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.260> be<00:02:43.380> adding<00:02:43.620> on<00:02:45.470> which

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
seven we're going to be adding on which

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.000 
seven we're going to be adding on which
normally<00:02:46.950> means<00:02:47.720> traveling<00:02:48.720> in<00:02:49.050> this

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
normally means traveling in this

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.890 
normally means traveling in this
direction<00:02:52.790> however<00:02:53.790> because<00:02:54.420> we're<00:02:54.570> adding

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
direction however because we're adding

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.890 
direction however because we're adding
on<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.470> negative<00:02:56.010> number<00:02:56.570> it's<00:02:57.570> going<00:02:57.690> to

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
on a negative number it's going to

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.820 
on a negative number it's going to
change<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.590> direction<00:02:59.450> okay<00:03:00.450> so<00:03:01.440> a<00:03:01.470> negative

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
change the direction okay so a negative

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.560 
change the direction okay so a negative
number<00:03:02.280> added<00:03:02.850> on<00:03:04.730> changes<00:03:05.730> direction

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
number added on changes direction

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.970 
number added on changes direction
this<00:03:07.080> is<00:03:07.290> why<00:03:07.790> one<00:03:08.790> reason<00:03:08.820> why<00:03:09.230> at<00:03:10.230> primary

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
this is why one reason why at primary

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.080 
this is why one reason why at primary
school<00:03:11.280> or<00:03:11.489> at<00:03:12.020> your<00:03:13.020> earliest<00:03:13.590> age<00:03:14.340> you<00:03:14.940> will

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
school or at your earliest age you will

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.940 
school or at your earliest age you will
find<00:03:15.420> that<00:03:15.720> sometimes<00:03:16.470> they're<00:03:16.620> referred<00:03:16.709> to

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
find that sometimes they're referred to

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.430 
find that sometimes they're referred to
as<00:03:17.370> directed<00:03:18.150> numbers<00:03:18.540> because<00:03:18.900> they<00:03:19.049> change

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
as directed numbers because they change

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.440 
as directed numbers because they change
the<00:03:19.709> direction<00:03:19.890> so<00:03:20.850> what<00:03:21.000> we're<00:03:21.090> going<00:03:21.180> to<00:03:21.239> do

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
the direction so what we're going to do

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.850 
the direction so what we're going to do
is<00:03:21.690> we're<00:03:21.840> going<00:03:21.959> to<00:03:22.049> start<00:03:22.320> at<00:03:22.440> seven

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
is we're going to start at seven

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.580 
is we're going to start at seven
normally<00:03:23.760> we<00:03:23.880> would<00:03:24.030> be<00:03:24.150> adding<00:03:24.420> and<00:03:25.290> going<00:03:25.500> up

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
normally we would be adding and going up

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.320 
normally we would be adding and going up
this<00:03:25.709> way<00:03:25.920> but<00:03:26.459> because<00:03:26.880> it's<00:03:27.000> a<00:03:27.120> negative

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
this way but because it's a negative

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.880 
this way but because it's a negative
number<00:03:27.540> we're<00:03:27.989> going<00:03:28.080> to<00:03:28.170> change<00:03:28.500> direction

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
number we're going to change direction

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.009 
number we're going to change direction
then<00:03:29.070> we're<00:03:29.190> going<00:03:29.310> to<00:03:29.370> count<00:03:29.580> down<00:03:29.940> by<00:03:30.239> 15<00:03:30.720> so

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
then we're going to count down by 15 so

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:36.860 
then we're going to count down by 15 so
we<00:03:31.110> go<00:03:31.230> one<00:03:31.980> two<00:03:32.790> three<00:03:33.350> four<00:03:34.350> five<00:03:35.130> six<00:03:36.030> seven

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
we go one two three four five six seven

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.850 
we go one two three four five six seven
brings<00:03:37.650> us<00:03:37.799> to<00:03:37.980> zero<00:03:38.280> and<00:03:38.640> then<00:03:39.450> eight<00:03:40.019> nine

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
brings us to zero and then eight nine

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.460 
brings us to zero and then eight nine
ten<00:03:41.579> eleven<00:03:42.480> twelve<00:03:42.860> thirty<00:03:43.860> forty<00:03:44.850> fifty

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
ten eleven twelve thirty forty fifty

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.860 
ten eleven twelve thirty forty fifty
okay<00:03:46.470> and<00:03:46.980> therefore<00:03:47.790> I<00:03:47.820> can<00:03:48.090> count<00:03:48.329> down<00:03:48.540> from

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
okay and therefore I can count down from

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.770 
okay and therefore I can count down from
my<00:03:49.110> zero

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:00.740 

and<00:03:54.780> the<00:03:54.870> answer<00:03:55.320> is<00:03:56.000> -8<00:03:58.430> ok<00:03:59.430> this<00:04:00.000> works<00:04:00.360> if

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
and the answer is -8 ok this works if

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.660 
and the answer is -8 ok this works if
you<00:04:00.870> always<00:04:01.230> think<00:04:01.500> of<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:01.770> first<00:04:02.100> number<00:04:02.520> as

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
you always think of the first number as

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.670 
you always think of the first number as
your<00:04:02.850> starting<00:04:03.150> point<00:04:03.360> and<00:04:03.780> the<00:04:04.260> second

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
your starting point and the second

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.560 
your starting point and the second
number<00:04:05.010> as<00:04:05.240> what<00:04:06.240> you're<00:04:06.390> adding<00:04:06.780> on<00:04:08.330> ok<00:04:09.330> let's

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
number as what you're adding on ok let's

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.310 
number as what you're adding on ok let's
have<00:04:09.720> a<00:04:09.780> look<00:04:09.900> at<00:04:10.410> a<00:04:10.920> third<00:04:11.550> example<00:04:12.110> ok<00:04:13.110> this

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
have a look at a third example ok this

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.470 
have a look at a third example ok this
time<00:04:13.710> we're<00:04:14.430> gonna<00:04:14.550> start<00:04:15.030> with<00:04:15.210> a<00:04:15.240> negative

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
time we're gonna start with a negative

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:22.700 
time we're gonna start with a negative
number<00:04:16.730> and<00:04:18.530> add<00:04:19.530> 4<00:04:20.540> okay<00:04:21.540> so<00:04:22.290> here's<00:04:22.590> our

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
number and add 4 okay so here's our

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.440 
number and add 4 okay so here's our
number<00:04:23.070> line<00:04:24.410> there's<00:04:25.410> the<00:04:25.590> zero<00:04:26.450> remember

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
number line there's the zero remember

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.770 
number line there's the zero remember
we're<00:04:27.600> starting<00:04:27.990> at<00:04:28.590> this<00:04:28.890> number<00:04:29.570> and<00:04:30.570> we<00:04:30.630> are

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
we're starting at this number and we are

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.980 
we're starting at this number and we are
adding<00:04:31.350> on<00:04:31.500> 4<00:04:32.900> normally<00:04:33.900> when<00:04:34.020> we're<00:04:34.200> adding

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
adding on 4 normally when we're adding

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.130 
adding on 4 normally when we're adding
ok<00:04:36.990> that<00:04:37.170> way<00:04:37.820> so<00:04:38.820> let's<00:04:39.030> start<00:04:39.330> at<00:04:39.450> negative<00:04:39.570> 3

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
ok that way so let's start at negative 3

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.360 
ok that way so let's start at negative 3
here<00:04:40.470> it<00:04:40.590> is<00:04:40.740> and<00:04:41.220> let's<00:04:41.420> add<00:04:42.420> on<00:04:42.660> for<00:04:43.370> adding

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
here it is and let's add on for adding

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.860 
here it is and let's add on for adding
it's<00:04:44.610> a<00:04:44.730> normal<00:04:45.120> number<00:04:45.270> it's<00:04:45.540> a<00:04:45.600> positive

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
it's a normal number it's a positive

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.540 
it's a normal number it's a positive
number<00:04:46.200> so<00:04:46.620> we're<00:04:46.920> going<00:04:47.100> in<00:04:47.280> the<00:04:47.400> right

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
number so we're going in the right

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.150 
number so we're going in the right
direction<00:04:47.790> we're<00:04:48.330> going<00:04:48.510> in<00:04:48.720> that<00:04:48.870> direction

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
direction we're going in that direction

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.740 
direction we're going in that direction
there's<00:04:50.160> no<00:04:50.430> way<00:04:50.670> that<00:04:51.270> we're<00:04:51.390> gonna<00:04:51.450> have<00:04:51.660> to

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
there's no way that we're gonna have to

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.180 
there's no way that we're gonna have to
turn<00:04:51.900> around<00:04:52.080> now<00:04:52.410> because<00:04:52.590> we're<00:04:52.890> not<00:04:52.920> adding

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
turn around now because we're not adding

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.910 
turn around now because we're not adding
a<00:04:53.460> negative<00:04:53.640> number<00:04:54.410> where<00:04:55.410> we<00:04:55.530> start<00:04:55.800> is

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
a negative number where we start is

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.030 
a negative number where we start is
minus<00:04:56.310> 3<00:04:56.580> that's<00:04:57.240> ok<00:04:57.780> we're<00:04:58.290> adding<00:04:58.680> on<00:04:58.830> a

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
minus 3 that's ok we're adding on a

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.980 
minus 3 that's ok we're adding on a
normal<00:04:59.610> number<00:04:59.880> so<00:05:00.240> we're<00:05:00.390> using<00:05:00.630> the<00:05:00.840> normal

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
normal number so we're using the normal

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.020 
normal number so we're using the normal
rules<00:05:01.320> for<00:05:01.530> adding<00:05:01.830> and<00:05:02.160> we're<00:05:02.520> moving<00:05:02.820> to<00:05:02.940> the

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
rules for adding and we're moving to the

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:10.510 
rules for adding and we're moving to the
right<00:05:04.700> giving<00:05:05.700> us<00:05:05.850> an<00:05:05.970> answer<00:05:06.120> of<00:05:06.510> 1<00:05:09.140> ok<00:05:10.140> and

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
right giving us an answer of 1 ok and

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.740 
right giving us an answer of 1 ok and
again<00:05:11.520> if<00:05:11.940> I<00:05:12.120> use<00:05:12.300> a<00:05:12.330> slightly<00:05:12.630> different

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
again if I use a slightly different

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.510 
again if I use a slightly different
example

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.490 

okay<00:05:17.419> as<00:05:17.660> always<00:05:18.759> adding<00:05:19.759> gays<00:05:19.970> that<00:05:20.000> way

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
okay as always adding gays that way

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.620 
okay as always adding gays that way
unless<00:05:21.500> it's<00:05:21.710> a<00:05:21.800> negative<00:05:21.979> number<00:05:22.630> we're

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
unless it's a negative number we're

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.830 
unless it's a negative number we're
going<00:05:23.780> to<00:05:23.870> start<00:05:24.169> with<00:05:25.389> sorry<00:05:26.389> not<00:05:26.539> seven

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
going to start with sorry not seven

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.520 
going to start with sorry not seven
we're<00:05:27.229> going<00:05:27.349> to<00:05:27.410> start<00:05:27.620> with<00:05:27.710> minus<00:05:28.160> five<00:05:29.530> we

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
we're going to start with minus five we

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:35.920 
we're going to start with minus five we
are<00:05:30.620> going<00:05:30.770> to<00:05:30.830> add<00:05:31.479> two<00:05:33.639> okay<00:05:34.639> so<00:05:35.300> again<00:05:35.539> I<00:05:35.599> put

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
are going to add two okay so again I put

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.629 
are going to add two okay so again I put
a<00:05:35.960> triangle<00:05:36.349> around<00:05:36.710> that<00:05:36.830> one<00:05:36.949> minus<00:05:37.370> five<00:05:37.580> is

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:37.639 
a triangle around that one minus five is

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:40.480 
a triangle around that one minus five is
where<00:05:37.940> we're<00:05:38.060> starting<00:05:38.889> we<00:05:39.889> are<00:05:40.069> going<00:05:40.250> to<00:05:40.310> add

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
where we're starting we are going to add

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.150 
where we're starting we are going to add
two<00:05:41.030> is<00:05:41.330> it<00:05:41.599> a<00:05:41.660> negative<00:05:42.050> moment<00:05:42.199> no<00:05:42.590> so<00:05:42.919> we<00:05:43.009> use

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 
two is it a negative moment no so we use

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.279 
two is it a negative moment no so we use
the<00:05:43.280> normal<00:05:43.490> rules<00:05:43.940> for<00:05:44.180> adding<00:05:44.360> start<00:05:45.169> at

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:45.289 
the normal rules for adding start at

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:51.960 
the normal rules for adding start at
negative<00:05:45.440> five<00:05:45.919> and<00:05:45.949> add<00:05:46.900> to<00:05:48.940> its<00:05:49.940> minus<00:05:50.360> three

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
negative five and add to its minus three

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:57.450 
negative five and add to its minus three
just<00:05:52.970> like<00:05:53.120> that<00:05:53.680> okay<00:05:54.680> one<00:05:55.639> final<00:05:56.000> example

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
just like that okay one final example

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.360 
just like that okay one final example
and<00:05:59.020> this<00:06:00.020> one<00:06:00.259> is<00:06:00.500> one<00:06:00.740> that<00:06:00.919> people<00:06:01.099> will

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
and this one is one that people will

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.850 
and this one is one that people will
often<00:06:01.970> get<00:06:02.180> wrong<00:06:02.419> but<00:06:02.900> if<00:06:03.020> you<00:06:03.199> followed<00:06:03.830> what

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
often get wrong but if you followed what

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.980 
often get wrong but if you followed what
we've<00:06:04.099> just<00:06:04.130> done<00:06:04.479> you<00:06:05.479> should<00:06:05.509> be<00:06:05.720> able<00:06:05.900> to

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
we've just done you should be able to

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.390 
we've just done you should be able to
see<00:06:06.110> what<00:06:06.289> we're<00:06:06.409> going<00:06:06.530> to<00:06:06.590> do<00:06:08.050> okay<00:06:09.050> -<00:06:09.889> to<00:06:10.130> add

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
see what we're going to do okay - to add

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.430 
see what we're going to do okay - to add
minus<00:06:11.210> 5<00:06:11.419> 1<00:06:11.690> negative<00:06:11.960> 2<00:06:12.229> add<00:06:12.650> negative<00:06:13.009> 5<00:06:14.440> so

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 
minus 5 1 negative 2 add negative 5 so

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.050 
minus 5 1 negative 2 add negative 5 so
here<00:06:15.620> we<00:06:15.680> go<00:06:15.860> we're<00:06:16.400> starting<00:06:16.909> at<00:06:17.150> minus<00:06:17.599> 2

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:19.060 
here we go we're starting at minus 2

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.379 
here we go we're starting at minus 2
which<00:06:20.060> is<00:06:20.090> there<00:06:20.590> we<00:06:21.590> are<00:06:21.620> adding<00:06:22.130> on<00:06:22.389> negative

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:23.389 
which is there we are adding on negative

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:28.350 
which is there we are adding on negative
5<00:06:24.099> okay<00:06:25.130> remember<00:06:25.969> normally<00:06:26.120> if<00:06:26.449> we're<00:06:26.659> adding

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360 
5 okay remember normally if we're adding

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.510 
5 okay remember normally if we're adding
we're<00:06:29.360> going<00:06:29.539> that<00:06:29.659> way<00:06:29.870> but<00:06:30.860> this<00:06:31.009> time<00:06:31.070> we

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:31.520 
we're going that way but this time we

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.270 
we're going that way but this time we
are<00:06:31.639> adding<00:06:31.820> on<00:06:32.270> a<00:06:32.509> negative<00:06:33.409> number<00:06:33.650> that's

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:34.280 
are adding on a negative number that's

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:40.540 
are adding on a negative number that's
going<00:06:34.520> to<00:06:34.610> change<00:06:34.880> direction<00:06:39.190> so<00:06:40.190> instead<00:06:40.490> of

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:40.550 
going to change direction so instead of

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.080 
going to change direction so instead of
moving<00:06:40.759> to<00:06:41.060> the<00:06:41.150> right<00:06:42.759> we're<00:06:43.759> now<00:06:43.849> going<00:06:44.030> to

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.090 
moving to the right we're now going to

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.749 
moving to the right we're now going to
move<00:06:44.240> to<00:06:44.300> the<00:06:44.539> left<00:06:44.800> so<00:06:45.800> remember<00:06:46.280> our<00:06:46.310> start

00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:46.759 
move to the left so remember our start

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:49.240 
move to the left so remember our start
point<00:06:47.000> is<00:06:47.210> here<00:06:47.509> at<00:06:48.139> negative<00:06:48.590> 2<00:06:48.860> doesn't

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.250 
point is here at negative 2 doesn't

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:50.439 
point is here at negative 2 doesn't
matter<00:06:49.340> if<00:06:49.490> that's<00:06:49.639> positive<00:06:50.030> or<00:06:50.090> negative

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:50.449 
matter if that's positive or negative

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:51.580 
matter if that's positive or negative
that<00:06:50.569> doesn't<00:06:50.810> have<00:06:50.930> any<00:06:51.050> bearing<00:06:51.289> on<00:06:51.469> the

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:51.590 
that doesn't have any bearing on the

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.279 
that doesn't have any bearing on the
direction<00:06:51.889> it's<00:06:52.550> this<00:06:52.909> number<00:06:53.150> here<00:06:53.659> we<00:06:54.259> are

00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:54.289 
direction it's this number here we are

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:56.740 
direction it's this number here we are
adding<00:06:54.650> on<00:06:54.949> a<00:06:55.190> negative<00:06:55.580> number<00:06:56.240> so<00:06:56.270> we<00:06:56.659> are

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:56.750 
adding on a negative number so we are

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.990 
adding on a negative number so we are
going<00:06:56.900> to<00:06:56.960> go<00:06:57.229> to<00:06:57.620> the<00:06:57.740> left<00:06:58.099> we're<00:06:58.460> changing

00:06:58.990 --> 00:06:59.000 
going to go to the left we're changing

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.209 
going to go to the left we're changing
direction<00:06:59.150> 1<00:06:59.630> 2<00:07:00.380> 3<00:07:01.370> 4<00:07:02.240> 5<00:07:03.080> and<00:07:03.710> if<00:07:03.949> you<00:07:04.039> count

00:07:04.209 --> 00:07:04.219 
direction 1 2 3 4 5 and if you count

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:08.700 
direction 1 2 3 4 5 and if you count
down

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:08.710 

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:11.850 

you<00:07:09.710> will<00:07:09.830> get<00:07:09.919> the<00:07:10.069> answer<00:07:10.400> minus<00:07:10.850> seven

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:11.860 
you will get the answer minus seven

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.439 
you will get the answer minus seven
there<00:07:12.860> are<00:07:13.039> a<00:07:13.220> lot<00:07:13.610> of<00:07:13.639> people<00:07:14.090> who<00:07:14.210> would<00:07:14.360> be

00:07:14.439 --> 00:07:14.449 
there are a lot of people who would be

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:15.700 
there are a lot of people who would be

positive if you're multiplying and
