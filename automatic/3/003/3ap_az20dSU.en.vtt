okay hi i'm richie bad truthful justify
your<00:00:05.520> ventilation<00:00:06.420> time<00:00:09.589> give<00:00:10.589> the<00:00:10.740> corner

00:00:11.109 --> 00:00:11.119 
your ventilation time give the corner

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:17.390 
your ventilation time give the corner
just<00:00:12.119> like<00:00:12.179> a<00:00:12.299> seat<00:00:15.049> here<00:00:16.049> make<00:00:16.710> it<00:00:16.740> here<00:00:17.070> in<00:00:17.220> is

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
just like a seat here make it here in is

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:26.089 
just like a seat here make it here in is
it<00:00:20.660> and<00:00:21.660> you<00:00:22.019> overlap<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.769> each<00:00:23.490> other<00:00:25.099> then

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
it and you overlap it each other then

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.159 
it and you overlap it each other then
you<00:00:26.220> weave<00:00:26.429> the<00:00:26.609> nail<00:00:26.820> through<00:00:27.029> next<00:00:27.599> wing

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:30.169 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:34.490 

then<00:00:31.169> you<00:00:31.529> go<00:00:31.650> on<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.829> other<00:00:31.949> side<00:00:33.230> doing<00:00:34.230> fine

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
then you go on the other side doing fine

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:42.549 
then you go on the other side doing fine
so<00:00:36.590> you<00:00:37.590> do<00:00:37.829> same<00:00:38.160> thing<00:00:39.710> talk<00:00:40.940> fold<00:00:41.940> under

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
so you do same thing talk fold under

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:50.380 
so you do same thing talk fold under
over<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.590> leave<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.489> nail<00:00:44.640> through

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.660 

then<00:00:51.020> they<00:00:51.470> could<00:00:51.680> do<00:00:51.830> this<00:00:51.980> right<00:00:54.580> when<00:00:55.580> you

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
then they could do this right when you

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.970 
then they could do this right when you
take<00:00:55.820> a<00:00:55.880> corner<00:00:56.210> let's<00:00:56.750> say<00:00:56.930> you<00:00:57.560> want<00:00:57.740> to<00:00:57.800> pull

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
take a corner let's say you want to pull

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.040 
take a corner let's say you want to pull
it<00:00:58.010> this<00:00:58.310> way<00:00:58.370> towards<00:00:58.970> the<00:00:59.030> tree<00:00:59.300> so<00:00:59.630> it<00:00:59.810> wraps

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
it this way towards the tree so it wraps

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.820 
it this way towards the tree so it wraps
around<00:01:00.790> burlap<00:01:01.790> best<00:01:02.060> around<00:01:02.590> then<00:01:03.590> you<00:01:03.680> make

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
around burlap best around then you make

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.530 
around burlap best around then you make
a<00:01:03.860> pin<00:01:04.160> here<00:01:04.370> same<00:01:04.850> thing<00:01:04.879> again

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
a pin here same thing again

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:12.780 
a pin here same thing again
you<00:01:05.930> stab<00:01:06.820> poke<00:01:07.820> through<00:01:08.150> and<00:01:08.590> talk<00:01:09.590> on<00:01:09.770> here

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:21.310 

on<00:01:13.790> this<00:01:13.940> side<00:01:15.670> this<00:01:16.670> way<00:01:17.620> to<00:01:18.620> the<00:01:18.710> left<00:01:20.320> and

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
on this side this way to the left and

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.630 
on this side this way to the left and
make<00:01:21.770> it<00:01:21.920> talk<00:01:24.369> and<00:01:25.369> they<00:01:25.460> can<00:01:25.490> talk

make it talk and they can talk
underneath<00:01:26.150> this<00:01:26.330> whip<00:01:27.009> egg<00:01:28.009> always<00:01:28.369> work

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
underneath this whip egg always work

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.550 
underneath this whip egg always work
perfectly<00:01:28.580> on<00:01:29.710> every<00:01:30.710> tree<00:01:32.020> and<00:01:33.020> then<00:01:33.140> same

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
perfectly on every tree and then same

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.880 
perfectly on every tree and then same
thing<00:01:33.800> today<00:01:34.220> we've<00:01:34.540> hoping<00:01:35.540> they'll<00:01:35.710> hook<00:01:36.710> it

those can't go all the way to the
corners<00:03:00.500> you<00:03:01.340> can<00:03:01.370> fix<00:03:01.700> that<00:03:01.910> you<00:03:02.120> take<00:03:02.330> this

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
corners you can fix that you take this

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:03.840 
corners you can fix that you take this
lip<00:03:02.840> right<00:03:03.050> here

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
lip right here

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.630 
lip right here
and<00:03:04.850> make<00:03:05.060> sure<00:03:05.090> the<00:03:05.270> roots<00:03:05.450> are<00:03:05.660> actually

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
and make sure the roots are actually

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.070 
and make sure the roots are actually
then<00:03:07.640> you<00:03:07.730> can<00:03:07.880> make<00:03:08.000> a<00:03:08.030> fancy<00:03:08.360> talk<00:03:08.720> you<00:03:08.959> can
