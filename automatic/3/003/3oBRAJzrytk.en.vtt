out<00:02:45.850> but<00:02:46.450> it<00:02:46.630> would<00:02:46.810> mostly<00:02:47.200> reduce<00:02:47.680> the

clean your path up but be careful in
doing<00:02:52.720> so<00:02:52.959> because<00:02:53.560> you<00:02:53.709> can<00:02:53.890> also<00:02:54.040> slightly

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
doing so because you can also slightly

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.040 
doing so because you can also slightly
alter<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.150> shape<00:02:55.180> of<00:02:55.570> your<00:02:55.600> object

single object as your final silhouette

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.860 
single object as your final silhouette
this<00:03:03.190> means<00:03:03.459> that<00:03:03.519> you<00:03:03.670> can<00:03:03.820> build<00:03:03.970> it<00:03:04.150> simply

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
this means that you can build it simply

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.190 
this means that you can build it simply

fact if you plan on doing a lot of
concept<00:03:10.630> silhouettes<00:03:11.110> you<00:03:11.680> could<00:03:11.830> develop<00:03:12.070> a

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
concept silhouettes you could develop a

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.400 
concept silhouettes you could develop a
simple<00:03:12.670> library<00:03:12.970> of<00:03:13.060> body<00:03:13.299> parts<00:03:13.510> shapes<00:03:13.900> so

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
simple library of body parts shapes so

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:15.960 
simple library of body parts shapes so
you<00:03:14.500> can<00:03:14.680> quickly<00:03:14.860> build<00:03:15.190> yourself<00:03:15.610> a<00:03:15.820> unique

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
you can quickly build yourself a unique

creature or character sometimes when I
get<00:03:19.450> lazy<00:03:19.720> I<00:03:20.110> use<00:03:20.530> a<00:03:20.560> simplify<00:03:21.250> command<00:03:21.640> which

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
get lazy I use a simplify command which

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.120 
get lazy I use a simplify command which
takes<00:03:22.390> my<00:03:22.540> path<00:03:22.810> and<00:03:23.080> simplifies<00:03:23.950> it

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
takes my path and simplifies it

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.110 
takes my path and simplifies it
completely<00:03:24.840> it<00:03:25.840> can<00:03:26.019> be<00:03:26.170> used<00:03:26.260> in<00:03:26.410> two<00:03:26.620> ways

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
completely it can be used in two ways

completely it can be used in two ways
firstly<00:03:28.120> you<00:03:28.510> can<00:03:28.690> draw<00:03:28.930> a<00:03:28.959> rough<00:03:29.260> shape<00:03:29.650> with

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
firstly you can draw a rough shape with

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.880 
firstly you can draw a rough shape with
a<00:03:30.070> pencil<00:03:30.310> tool<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:31.750> simplify<00:03:32.290> command<00:03:32.620> will

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
a pencil tool the simplify command will

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.740 
a pencil tool the simplify command will
take<00:03:33.130> your<00:03:33.310> selected<00:03:33.790> shape<00:03:34.000> or<00:03:34.209> points<00:03:34.570> and

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
take your selected shape or points and

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.259 
take your selected shape or points and
simplify<00:03:35.709> them<00:03:35.920> to<00:03:36.430> get<00:03:36.549> rid<00:03:36.850> of<00:03:36.880> unnecessary

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
simplify them to get rid of unnecessary

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.890 
simplify them to get rid of unnecessary
points<00:03:38.850> secondly<00:03:39.850> you<00:03:40.239> can<00:03:40.420> use<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:40.690> pen<00:03:40.870> tool

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
points secondly you can use the pen tool

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.530 
points secondly you can use the pen tool
and<00:03:41.320> create<00:03:41.620> a<00:03:41.769> quick<00:03:42.100> straight-edged<00:03:43.000> object

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
and create a quick straight-edged object

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.229 
and create a quick straight-edged object
then<00:03:44.110> simplify<00:03:44.860> it<00:03:44.920> to<00:03:45.489> give<00:03:45.640> you<00:03:45.760> a<00:03:45.910> more

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
then simplify it to give you a more

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.870 
then simplify it to give you a more
smoothed<00:03:46.720> out<00:03:46.900> version<00:03:47.489> it<00:03:48.489> can<00:03:48.640> sometimes

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
smoothed out version it can sometimes

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.970 
smoothed out version it can sometimes
leave<00:03:49.269> you<00:03:49.420> with<00:03:49.570> corner<00:03:49.930> points<00:03:50.320> but<00:03:50.829> when

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
leave you with corner points but when

you are trying to rough out a shape as

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
fast as possible that's the last thing

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.730 
fast as possible that's the last thing
that<00:03:55.060> should<00:03:55.269> matter

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:56.740 
that should matter

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.100 
that should matter
I<00:03:56.800> have<00:03:57.340> the<00:03:57.490> simplify<00:03:58.060> command<00:03:58.420> set<00:03:58.750> as<00:03:58.990> an

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
I have the simplify command set as an

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.820 
I have the simplify command set as an
action<00:03:59.530> because<00:04:00.190> I<00:04:00.280> use<00:04:00.430> it<00:04:00.610> so<00:04:00.790> often

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
action because I use it so often

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.080 
action because I use it so often
unfortunately<00:04:02.830> you<00:04:03.190> can't<00:04:03.460> set<00:04:03.700> it<00:04:03.730> to<00:04:04.060> a

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
unfortunately you can't set it to a

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.000 
unfortunately you can't set it to a
hotkey<00:04:04.570> so<00:04:05.020> it<00:04:05.080> needs<00:04:05.260> to<00:04:05.350> be<00:04:05.500> set<00:04:05.710> as<00:04:05.860> an

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
hotkey so it needs to be set as an

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.120 
hotkey so it needs to be set as an
action<00:04:07.110> everything<00:04:08.110> in<00:04:08.230> life<00:04:08.260> can<00:04:08.710> be<00:04:08.860> broken

action everything in life can be broken

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.670 
action everything in life can be broken
down<00:04:09.280> into<00:04:09.610> simple<00:04:10.120> shapes<00:04:10.420> and<00:04:10.750> it<00:04:11.290> is<00:04:11.440> easy

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
down into simple shapes and it is easy

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.260 
down into simple shapes and it is easy
to<00:04:11.830> correct<00:04:12.040> contact<00:04:12.550> silhouettes<00:04:13.030> in<00:04:13.150> the

to correct contact silhouettes in the
same<00:04:13.480> way<00:04:14.220> just<00:04:15.220> by<00:04:15.430> using<00:04:15.610> your<00:04:15.850> ovals<00:04:16.180> and

same way just by using your ovals and
rectangles<00:04:16.500> you<00:04:17.500> can<00:04:17.680> make<00:04:17.830> it<00:04:17.980> fairly<00:04:18.280> decent

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
rectangles you can make it fairly decent

silhouettes<00:04:19.890> after<00:04:20.890> that<00:04:21.040> you<00:04:21.520> can<00:04:21.670> merge<00:04:21.940> all

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
silhouettes after that you can merge all

or some of the shapes and use the
