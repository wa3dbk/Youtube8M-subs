 horizons in 1 08 still on ps3 one is 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:22.570
 here on the map with my software buddy 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.680
 realization today so here actually 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.239
 it's about taking out the map 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.860
 officially as before but they have 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:27.849
 used the shield of course since 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.890
 the double jump and patch is safe 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.450
 shield so we jump on the guardrail 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.730
 we will replace the shield by 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.050
 enabling overclocking taker 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.610
 take the momentum on the right for 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.649
 make a double jump activated the exoplanet 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.200
 to return to the left here it is necessary 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.879
 so be able to chain these movements 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.899
 nothing special except that 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:45.999
 that it must actually be there 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:48.670
 take the focused as before on the left 

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:50.800
 here to land on the species of you 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.809
 you go to the end at the end you go 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.059
 so go left by a double jump 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.010
 well boost then you continue 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.420
 to the black block in front of you 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.940
 you will be able to jump on 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.739
 you have to go through the window here to be 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.750
 in the secret hole so has it as before 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.040
 and then actually go back to you 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.180
 life on the other side you let yourself 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.549
 fall into the ground within a year or 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.840
 halbreich then you go on the 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:12.729
 left 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.310
 and there you will let yourself fall into 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.500
 done on the left but you come back in 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.940
 made for on the right so left to 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.830
 right to land on the ledge 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.350
 russia see that powell bracci a 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.810
 little bit you continue to see 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.590
 the bottom right corner where the fell 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.850
 above 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.440
 there you have to do the whole trick did not go 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.930
 not especially in the middle despite the impacts 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.470
 it's invisible so be careful 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.060
 does well do it well the trick 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.320
 nothing special and then you 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.600
 land in this room with the 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.430
 famous shuttle and there you have 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.350
 small rooms on the exploitable side 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.990
 all can do all the trick 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.570
 everything is hard there is nothing transparent 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.160
 you can even climb the stairs to 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.510
 find yourself in height so as to 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.360
 monitor the enemies who would be them 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.500
 in the play area there so that's it 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.750
 can help and we can even 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.610
 go in front here by a double jump and 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.500
 to finish this video in horizons 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.500
