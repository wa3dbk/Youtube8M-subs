00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.579
 hi this is udl welcome shaman 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.890
 in that of a chrono today I 

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:11.390
 you were talking about arcadia that's a game for 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.400
 2 to 4 players can last two 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:16.699
 parts of about 60 minutes from 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.380
 14 so in arcadia we're playing 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:21.380
 guilds that are trying to free 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.900
 arcadia so we'll choose a 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.749
 guild board and we're going to play 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.939
 around a tactical fight around 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:31.369
 player vs. environment goals 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.230
 serves missions that will present themselves 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.090
 but also from player to player 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.040
 since it's not a cooperative game 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.770
 and it will be necessary to beat on the others 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.380
 players so we have a plateau and 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.630
 we have a choice of twelve figurines 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.210
 of heroes also represented by 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.550
 little cards that represents theirs 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.650
 particular powers and every city goes 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.140
 be made up of three heroes so by 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.750
 default the figurines are neutral and 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.520
 we will add small supports of 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.910
 plinth that will identify them to others 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.600
 colors 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.829
 once we have placed that we 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.300
 have chosen our heroes we are going to have 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.220
 So our guild plateau 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.650
 contains the three heroes we're going 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.360
 give them equipment on 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.300
 functioning of activation in this 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.640
 game and that whenever you 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.680
 want to activate and play one of 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.990
 our characters which choose him the 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.840
 move and then it will have to place a 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.610
 activation token on the object we 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.900
 let's use to attack so there 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.360
 for example chose to attack with the 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.450
 faithful sword and I will be able to attack 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.190
 the monster by throwing the battle dice 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.040
 and defense and a tactical game so 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.590
 it's pretty classic at the gtld level 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.790
 with shields to represent 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.020
 defense of the arts or small swords 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.000
 explosion symbols for critics 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.799
 and here we are going to calculate the guys 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.170
 explained for now it's enough 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.330
 classic by cons I could not 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.869
 reuse my faithful sword with this 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.670
 character 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.770
 as long as I have not done an action 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.810
 particular for removing marks 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.100
 then we will be able to turn to 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.229
 each time alternating with others 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.210
 players activate a character or do 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.060
 to rest all the guinea the moment where 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.319
 we will rest the city ​​of enough criticism 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.810
 that's one of the originalities 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.940
 of the game so we will ask small 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.470
 marker pen 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.820
 everywhere on our characters at 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.680
 as the game progresses and 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.870
 at some point if we feel that we 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.930
 is in a position where we can give 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.940
 a turn to our opponent without playing 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.530
 we are a little bit protected 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.720
 choose to rest her life when she has 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.490
 none of our heroes are activated and 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.720
 exchange of what we remove all the 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.640
 small activation marker of our 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.570
 guild and in the next round we will be able to 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.910
 again reuse the objects a note d 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.290
 originality and so the fact that around 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.000
 scenarios that we will play 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.800
 we are not in cooperative mode 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.590
 so the show offers us 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.020
 ambitious goals for example here 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.520
 the goal is to go get some 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.650
 lost weapons in the neighborhood of 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.870
 blacksmiths and kill three monsters that 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.280
 were sent by the big villain so 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.590
 these are somewhat specific goals 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.150
 player against environment but we 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.400
 we can also have goals 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.520
 by killing the heroes of the opposing team 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.410
 since we are going to have a goal kill a 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.390
 glass which for my heroes that demand 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.770
 opponent to conquer or kill a 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.850
 red that will be for me a 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.180
 way to recover points of 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.840
 victory 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.470
 each scenario ends as soon as one 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.420
 player achieves three goals achieved 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.670
 resolved and that at least one of its 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.470
 objectives is a goal because 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.270
 must have at least a little done 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.810
 advance the story so that the 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:34.180
 scenario be won here's one last 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.220
 particularity of the game and that there is no 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.989
 of specific turn for the monsters the 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.520
 monsters will activate while being under the 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.260
 control of our opponents at the moment 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.900
 we're going to play so the mountains get 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.670
 triggers in two cases either when there 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.800
 has a displacement around the breakage of a 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.080
 monster we know a protective action 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.160
 so every time a player goes 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.960
 try to move around a 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.060
 monster we will trigger 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.710
 activating a world that will attack 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.510
 the player moving around him 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.980
 finally we have revenge action 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.990
 whenever a player decides 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.430
 to attack a monster the player who is 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.980
 currently in control of this world is going 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.570
 to be able to choose from displaced then 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.340
 have this monster attacked at his 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.200
 convenience in the most 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.720
 optimized possible call that so as 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.580
 the game is not cooperative it becomes 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.860
 interesting to optimize the actions of 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.989
 monsters to kill enemy heroes 

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:22.790
 here you know pretty much everything about 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.910
 arcade quest now to you of 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.910
 to play
