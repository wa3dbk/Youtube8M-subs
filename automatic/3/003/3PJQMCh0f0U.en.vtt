the stance we can look at two different

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.979 
the stance we can look at two different
types<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.399> stance<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:33.239> can<00:00:33.270> have<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.570> box<00:00:33.809> of

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.260 
types of stance you can have the box of
stance<00:00:34.260> which<00:00:34.829> is<00:00:34.980> more<00:00:35.100> traditional<00:00:35.670> or<00:00:35.820> you

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
stance which is more traditional or you

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.729

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.910 
can have the square run stance which
would<00:00:37.860> be<00:00:37.950> considered<00:00:38.399> more<00:00:38.850> modern<00:00:39.270> so<00:00:40.050> what

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
would be considered more modern so what

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.470 
would be considered more modern so what
I'm<00:00:41.040> going<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.219> be<00:00:41.340> showing<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:41.850> based<00:00:42.300> on

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
I'm going to be showing you is based on

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.479 
I'm going to be showing you is based on
a<00:00:42.510> right<00:00:42.780> handed<00:00:43.200> player<00:00:43.379> but<00:00:44.100> obviously<00:00:44.399> if

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
a right handed player but obviously if

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.590 
a right handed player but obviously if
you're<00:00:44.610> left-handed<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.300> would<00:00:45.450> just

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
you're left-handed you would just

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.380 
you're left-handed you would just
reverse<00:00:45.780> everything<00:00:46.579> so<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.789> boxer<00:00:48.120> stance

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
reverse everything so the boxer stance

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.830 
reverse everything so the boxer stance
first<00:00:48.930> as<00:00:49.460> you<00:00:50.460> would<00:00:50.579> expect<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.210> means<00:00:51.480> that

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
first as you would expect it means that

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.110 
first as you would expect it means that
one<00:00:52.289> leg<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.800> left<00:00:53.010> leg<00:00:53.219> in<00:00:53.370> my<00:00:53.489> case<00:00:53.760> is<00:00:53.969> in

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
one leg the left leg in my case is in

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.049 
one leg the left leg in my case is in
front<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:55.140> right<00:00:55.320> leg<00:00:55.620> we<00:00:56.340> stand<00:00:56.610> about<00:00:56.879> a

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
front of the right leg we stand about a

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.000 
front of the right leg we stand about a
shoulder<00:00:57.449> width<00:00:57.570> apart<00:00:57.719> at<00:00:58.289> least<00:00:58.440> for

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
shoulder width apart at least for

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.209 
shoulder width apart at least for
stability<00:00:59.899> so<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.020> right<00:01:01.260> foot<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.710> placed<00:01:01.980> on

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
stability so the right foot is placed on

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.579 
stability so the right foot is placed on
the<00:01:02.370> line<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.059> shot<00:01:03.300> with<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.350> toes
