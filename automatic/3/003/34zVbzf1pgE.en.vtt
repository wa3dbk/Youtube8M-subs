suspense horror and it's a little fun
I<00:02:57.370> told<00:02:58.370> you<00:02:58.520> to<00:02:58.610> stay<00:02:58.790> in<00:02:59.000> the<00:02:59.090> car<00:02:59.330> yet<00:03:00.320> as<00:03:00.590> you

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
I told you to stay in the car yet as you

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:01.660 
I told you to stay in the car yet as you
know<00:03:00.950> I'm<00:03:01.190> insane

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
know I'm insane

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.520 
know I'm insane
and<00:03:02.030> therefore<00:03:02.420> impervious<00:03:03.020> to<00:03:03.170> simple

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
and therefore impervious to simple

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.260 
and therefore impervious to simple
commands<00:03:03.890> and<00:03:04.190> when<00:03:04.610> you<00:03:04.700> blend<00:03:04.910> those<00:03:05.030> things

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
commands and when you blend those things

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:06.460 
commands and when you blend those things
correctly<00:03:05.690> I<00:03:05.780> think<00:03:06.050> that's<00:03:06.170> when<00:03:06.260> you<00:03:06.320> have

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
correctly I think that's when you have

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.670 
correctly I think that's when you have
appointment<00:03:07.370> TV
