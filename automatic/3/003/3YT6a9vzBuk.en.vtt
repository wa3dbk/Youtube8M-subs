cars may look like they have very

cars may look like they have very
similar<00:00:14.880> performance<00:00:15.170> but<00:00:16.170> we<00:00:16.260> actually<00:00:16.440> take

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
similar performance but we actually take

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.680 
similar performance but we actually take
them<00:00:16.980> out<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.369> streets<00:00:17.699> you<00:00:18.000> soon<00:00:18.510> realize

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
them out to the streets you soon realize

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.510 
them out to the streets you soon realize
they're<00:00:19.380> not<00:00:19.500> even<00:00:19.740> close<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.160> being<00:00:20.340> the

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
they're not even close to being the

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.359 
they're not even close to being the
single<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:21.090> tuned<00:00:21.480> them<00:00:21.660> at<00:00:21.840> 7:49<00:00:22.590> overall<00:00:23.130> and

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
single I tuned them at 7:49 overall and

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.490 
single I tuned them at 7:49 overall and
they<00:00:23.699> start<00:00:23.939> out<00:00:24.060> in<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.570> clash<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.199> they<00:00:25.320> can

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
they start out in a clash and they can

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.980 
they start out in a clash and they can
go<00:00:25.650> into<00:00:25.949> s-class<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.880> for<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.269> skill<00:00:27.539> mods<00:00:27.720> I

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
go into s-class and for the skill mods I

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.230 
go into s-class and for the skill mods I
used<00:00:28.289> four<00:00:28.769> seconds<00:00:29.250> Head<00:00:29.369> Start<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:29.910> one

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
used four seconds Head Start and one

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:37.069 
used four seconds Head Start and one
extended<00:00:30.750> NAS<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:35.480> let's<00:00:36.480> get<00:00:36.630> started<00:00:36.989> with

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
extended NAS and let's get started with

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.080 
extended NAS and let's get started with
our<00:00:37.140> top<00:00:37.469> speed<00:00:37.710> test<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.309> these<00:00:38.700> are<00:00:38.879> about

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
our top speed test and these are about

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.880 
our top speed test and these are about
middle<00:00:39.570> a-class<00:00:39.989> cars<00:00:40.320> since<00:00:40.590> they<00:00:40.739> don't

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
middle a-class cars since they don't

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.260 
middle a-class cars since they don't
have<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.129> highest<00:00:41.340> top<00:00:41.670> speed<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:42.090> they

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
have the highest top speed and they

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.209 
have the highest top speed and they
don't<00:00:42.420> have<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.660> lowest<00:00:42.809> top<00:00:43.140> speed<00:00:43.410> so<00:00:44.040> let's

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
don't have the lowest top speed so let's

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.709 
don't have the lowest top speed so let's
check<00:00:44.399> them<00:00:44.520> out<00:00:45.410> the<00:00:46.410> boss<00:00:46.620> gets<00:00:47.280> 208<00:00:48.120> with<00:00:48.510> no

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
check them out the boss gets 208 with no

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.560 
check them out the boss gets 208 with no
nose<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.440> Shelby<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:50.010> guess<00:00:50.250> 209<00:00:51.030> without

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
nose and the Shelby I guess 209 without

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.439 
nose and the Shelby I guess 209 without
nose<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.140> whatnot<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.800> goes<00:00:53.090> 227<00:00:54.090> miles<00:00:54.239> per

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
nose and whatnot it goes 227 miles per

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.040 
nose and whatnot it goes 227 miles per
hour<00:00:55.430> this<00:00:56.430> trike<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.730> really<00:00:57.180> twisty<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:57.989> I

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
hour this trike is really twisty so I

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.389 
hour this trike is really twisty so I
figured<00:00:58.379> it'd<00:00:58.440> be<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.559> good<00:00:58.800> track<00:00:59.070> since<00:00:59.309> they

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
figured it'd be a good track since they

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.770 
figured it'd be a good track since they
don't<00:00:59.520> have<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.789> highest<00:01:00.000> huh<00:01:00.300> speed<00:01:00.570> but

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
don't have the highest huh speed but

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.200 
don't have the highest huh speed but
they<00:01:00.899> have<00:01:01.079> good<00:01:01.469> acceleration<00:01:01.829> so<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.940> think

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
they have good acceleration so I think

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.700 
they have good acceleration so I think
they'll<00:01:03.390> fare<00:01:03.600> out<00:01:03.629> pretty<00:01:03.930> good<00:01:04.170> here<00:01:04.409> and

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
they'll fare out pretty good here and

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.830 
they'll fare out pretty good here and
for<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.339> first<00:01:05.549> turn<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.060> did<00:01:06.299> handbrake<00:01:06.689> the

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
for this first turn I did handbrake the

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.929 
for this first turn I did handbrake the
turn<00:01:07.049> but<00:01:07.560> when<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:07.770> was<00:01:07.890> testing<00:01:08.310> this<00:01:08.460> track<00:01:08.729> I

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
turn but when I was testing this track I

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.330 
turn but when I was testing this track I
did<00:01:09.240> do<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.570> few<00:01:09.930> runs<00:01:10.170> with<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.680> brake<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.130> turn

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
did do a few runs with the brake in turn

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.850 
did do a few runs with the brake in turn
and<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:12.540> speed<00:01:12.810> seemed<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.170> be<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.439> same<00:01:13.619> when

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
and the speed seemed to be the same when

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.469 
and the speed seemed to be the same when
I<00:01:13.979> would<00:01:14.100> handbrake<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.549> brake<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:14.909> turn<00:01:15.210> and

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
I would handbrake and brake and turn and

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.940 
I would handbrake and brake and turn and
mostly<00:01:15.840> because<00:01:15.990> these<00:01:16.380> cars<00:01:16.650> are<00:01:16.830> very

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
mostly because these cars are very

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.980 
mostly because these cars are very
drifting<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:17.970> it's<00:01:18.119> really<00:01:18.270> easy<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.780> hand

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
drifting so it's really easy to hand

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.020 
drifting so it's really easy to hand
brake<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.200> turn<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:20.250> for<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.549> track<00:01:20.820> with<00:01:21.000> a

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
brake and turn and for a track with a

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.609 
brake and turn and for a track with a
lot<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.390> turns<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.900> don't<00:01:22.080> have<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.290> rely<00:01:22.439> on

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
lot of turns you don't have to rely on

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.620 
lot of turns you don't have to rely on
high<00:01:22.890> speed<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.520> just<00:01:23.759> mostly<00:01:24.030> have<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.360> rely

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
high speed you just mostly have to rely

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.990 
high speed you just mostly have to rely
on<00:01:24.659> your<00:01:25.020> car's<00:01:25.290> acceleration<00:01:25.979> if<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.759> had<00:01:26.909> to

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
on your car's acceleration if I had to

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.910 
on your car's acceleration if I had to
give<00:01:27.180> these<00:01:27.360> cars<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.840> rating<00:01:28.290> on<00:01:28.439> their

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
give these cars a rating on their

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.460 
give these cars a rating on their
handling<00:01:29.400> like<00:01:29.939> from<00:01:30.299> easy<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.750> hard<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:31.290> was

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
handling like from easy to hard I was

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.410 
handling like from easy to hard I was
saying<00:01:31.770> they're<00:01:32.340> both<00:01:32.520> pretty<00:01:32.820> hard<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.210> drive

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
saying they're both pretty hard to drive

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.670 
saying they're both pretty hard to drive
but<00:01:33.720> at<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.900> same<00:01:34.049> time<00:01:34.290> they're<00:01:34.560> actually

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
but at the same time they're actually

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.069 
but at the same time they're actually
really<00:01:35.310> easy<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.759> drive<00:01:36.000> since<00:01:36.509> turning<00:01:36.810> them

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
really easy to drive since turning them

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.319 
really easy to drive since turning them
is<00:01:37.350> just<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:37.950> simple<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.850> only<00:01:38.880> thing<00:01:39.210> that

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
is just so simple the only thing that

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.450 
is just so simple the only thing that
makes<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.630> hard<00:01:39.689> is<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.439> Shelby<00:01:40.740> has<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.189> lot<00:01:41.430> of

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
makes it hard is the Shelby has a lot of

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.609 
makes it hard is the Shelby has a lot of
grip<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.270> have<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.540> actually<00:01:42.899> focus<00:01:43.170> more

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
grip so you have to actually focus more

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.499 
grip so you have to actually focus more
and<00:01:43.860> try<00:01:44.040> harder<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.460> turn<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.060> as<00:01:45.240> for<00:01:45.450> the

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
and try harder to turn it and as for the

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.450 
and try harder to turn it and as for the
boss<00:01:45.689> it's<00:01:46.259> actually<00:01:46.649> really<00:01:47.070> really<00:01:47.310> really

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
boss it's actually really really really

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.940 
boss it's actually really really really
drifty<00:01:47.909> it's<00:01:48.420> like<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.810> has<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.200> much<00:01:49.380> drift<00:01:49.770> to

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
drifty it's like it has so much drift to

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.710 
drifty it's like it has so much drift to
it<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.460> actually<00:01:50.909> makes<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.240> really<00:01:51.390> hard<00:01:51.659> to

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
it it actually makes it really hard to

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.810 
it it actually makes it really hard to
drive<00:01:52.020> but<00:01:52.409> all<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.740> drift<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.340> gives<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.640> lot

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
drive but all that drift it gives a lot

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.460 
drive but all that drift it gives a lot
of<00:01:53.850> freedom<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.299> be<00:01:54.540> able<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.750> take<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.259> turns

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
of freedom to be able to take the turns

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.770 
of freedom to be able to take the turns
really<00:01:55.710> fast<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.280> easy<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:57.329> when<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.600> turn

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
really fast and easy and when you turn

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.630 
really fast and easy and when you turn
with<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.049> Shelby<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.860> Shelby<00:01:59.219> is<00:01:59.310> much

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
with the Shelby the Shelby is much

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.850 
with the Shelby the Shelby is much
different<00:02:00.390> than<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.570> boss<00:02:00.810> because<00:02:01.409> the

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
different than the boss because the

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.310 
different than the boss because the
Shelby<00:02:02.340> doesn't<00:02:02.549> have<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:03.000> drift<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.960> just

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
Shelby doesn't have that drift it just

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.410 
Shelby doesn't have that drift it just
grips<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.829> road<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.340> when<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:05.939> turn<00:02:06.210> it

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
grips the road and when you turn it

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.880 
grips the road and when you turn it
turns<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:06.990> if<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.259> don't<00:02:07.409> turn<00:02:07.590> on<00:02:07.710> time

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
turns and if you don't turn on time

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.619 
turns and if you don't turn on time
you're<00:02:08.099> just<00:02:08.250> gonna<00:02:08.399> understeer<00:02:09.030> into<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.390> wall

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
you're just gonna understeer into a wall

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.089 
you're just gonna understeer into a wall
so<00:02:10.050> with<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.289> Shelby<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:10.739> have<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:11.009> actually

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
so with the Shelby you have to actually

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.930 
so with the Shelby you have to actually
time<00:02:11.819> it<00:02:12.030> right<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.390> yet<00:02:12.599> the

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
time it right and yet the

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.370 
time it right and yet the
that<00:02:13.060> turns<00:02:13.240> accurate<00:02:13.720> because<00:02:13.930> you<00:02:14.230> don't

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
that turns accurate because you don't

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.870 
that turns accurate because you don't
have<00:02:14.500> that<00:02:14.560> freedom<00:02:14.890> or<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.250> drift<00:02:15.580> that<00:02:15.730> the

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
have that freedom or the drift that the

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.270 
have that freedom or the drift that the
boss<00:02:16.060> has<00:02:16.390> all<00:02:17.170> right<00:02:17.380> as<00:02:17.590> you<00:02:17.770> can<00:02:17.890> see<00:02:18.100> they

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
boss has all right as you can see they

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.010 
boss has all right as you can see they
both<00:02:18.310> managed<00:02:18.940> really<00:02:19.360> good<00:02:19.570> on<00:02:19.720> reverse

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
both managed really good on reverse

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.050 
both managed really good on reverse
track<00:02:20.320> gate<00:02:20.530> they<00:02:21.010> got<00:02:21.190> just<00:02:21.520> about<00:02:21.670> almost

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
track gate they got just about almost

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.700 
track gate they got just about almost
the<00:02:22.300> same<00:02:22.510> time<00:02:24.990> all<00:02:25.990> right<00:02:26.050> and<00:02:26.260> for<00:02:26.620> our

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
the same time all right and for our

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.470 
the same time all right and for our
low-speed<00:02:27.160> handling<00:02:27.310> test<00:02:27.850> these<00:02:28.210> cars

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
low-speed handling test these cars

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.990 
low-speed handling test these cars
actually<00:02:28.660> do<00:02:29.230> really<00:02:29.560> good<00:02:29.800> on<00:02:30.040> low-speed

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
actually do really good on low-speed

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.940 
actually do really good on low-speed
twisty<00:02:31.540> tracks<00:02:31.810> that's<00:02:32.290> what<00:02:32.440> these<00:02:32.560> cars<00:02:32.800> are

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
twisty tracks that's what these cars are

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.290 
twisty tracks that's what these cars are
made<00:02:33.070> for<00:02:33.340> it<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.550> tracks<00:02:33.790> that<00:02:33.940> have<00:02:34.090> low

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
made for it the tracks that have low

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.210 
made for it the tracks that have low
speed<00:02:34.600> and<00:02:34.810> a<00:02:34.870> lot<00:02:35.020> of<00:02:35.080> turns<00:02:35.410> because<00:02:36.100> they

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
speed and a lot of turns because they

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.650 
speed and a lot of turns because they
have<00:02:36.370> good<00:02:36.520> acceleration<00:02:37.240> and<00:02:37.420> they<00:02:37.480> can

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
have good acceleration and they can

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.420 
have good acceleration and they can
accelerate<00:02:37.990> out<00:02:38.410> of<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:38.620> turns<00:02:38.890> really<00:02:39.100> fast

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
accelerate out of the turns really fast

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.430 
accelerate out of the turns really fast
so<00:02:39.880> if<00:02:39.970> you<00:02:40.060> like<00:02:40.210> oversteer<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:40.930> tell<00:02:41.140> slide

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
so if you like oversteer and tell slide

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.260 
so if you like oversteer and tell slide
that's<00:02:41.770> exactly<00:02:42.220> what<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.460> boss<00:02:42.610> is<00:02:42.640> it's

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
that's exactly what the boss is it's

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.490 
that's exactly what the boss is it's
actually<00:02:43.630> a<00:02:43.660> really<00:02:43.870> fun<00:02:44.140> car<00:02:44.320> to<00:02:44.350> drive

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
actually a really fun car to drive

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.260 
actually a really fun car to drive
because<00:02:45.010> it<00:02:45.130> has<00:02:45.220> a<00:02:45.250> lot<00:02:45.460> of<00:02:45.580> freedom<00:02:45.760> to<00:02:45.940> turn

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
because it has a lot of freedom to turn

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.210 
because it has a lot of freedom to turn
it's<00:02:46.660> not<00:02:46.840> like<00:02:47.020> so<00:02:47.440> grippy<00:02:47.860> where<00:02:48.040> you<00:02:48.130> have

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
it's not like so grippy where you have

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.890 
it's not like so grippy where you have
to<00:02:48.340> just<00:02:48.520> worry<00:02:48.700> about<00:02:48.760> braking<00:02:49.450> hard<00:02:49.630> and

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
to just worry about braking hard and

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.840 
to just worry about braking hard and
turning<00:02:50.260> and<00:02:50.440> for<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.740> Shelby<00:02:50.980> it's<00:02:51.370> a<00:02:51.550> really

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
turning and for the Shelby it's a really

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.790 
turning and for the Shelby it's a really
really<00:02:52.000> grippy<00:02:52.420> car<00:02:52.630> it<00:02:52.930> does<00:02:53.200> not<00:02:53.350> have<00:02:53.590> a<00:02:53.620> toe

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
really grippy car it does not have a toe

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.860 
really grippy car it does not have a toe
slide<00:02:54.130> it<00:02:54.370> does<00:02:54.490> not<00:02:54.640> have<00:02:54.880> any<00:02:55.180> kind<00:02:55.480> of<00:02:55.630> drift

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
slide it does not have any kind of drift

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.660 
slide it does not have any kind of drift
enos<00:02:56.110> to<00:02:56.290> it<00:02:56.410> it<00:02:56.530> just<00:02:56.680> basically<00:02:56.980> grips<00:02:57.520> the

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
enos to it it just basically grips the

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.900 
enos to it it just basically grips the
road

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
road

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.550 
road
it<00:02:58.120> turns<00:02:58.390> when<00:02:58.540> it<00:02:58.660> turns<00:02:58.930> when<00:02:59.230> you<00:02:59.320> tell<00:02:59.530> it

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
it turns when it turns when you tell it

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.440 
it turns when it turns when you tell it
to<00:02:59.650> turn<00:02:59.890> it<00:03:00.160> will<00:03:00.310> turn<00:03:00.550> and<00:03:00.790> other<00:03:01.060> than<00:03:01.300> that

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
to turn it will turn and other than that

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.090 
to turn it will turn and other than that
they<00:03:01.660> do<00:03:01.720> really<00:03:01.840> good<00:03:02.170> on<00:03:02.560> the<00:03:02.680> low-speed

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
they do really good on the low-speed

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.690 
they do really good on the low-speed
twisty<00:03:03.490> track<00:03:03.700> and<00:03:04.890> four-team<00:03:05.890> escapes<00:03:06.280> they

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
tend to lift up a little bit they might

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.949 
tend to lift up a little bit they might
stop<00:03:30.370> you<00:03:30.580> completely<00:03:31.000> but<00:03:31.570> what<00:03:31.810> the

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
stop you completely but what the

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.420 
stop you completely but what the
acceleration<00:03:32.530> they<00:03:32.680> have<00:03:32.860> they<00:03:33.100> can<00:03:33.160> easily

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
acceleration they have they can easily

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:40.199 
acceleration they have they can easily
accelerate<00:03:34.180> out<00:03:34.330> of<00:03:34.450> the<00:03:34.540> crash<00:03:34.780> and<00:03:39.209> when

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
accelerate out of the crash and when

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.300 
accelerate out of the crash and when
going<00:03:40.330> into<00:03:40.600> Robox<00:03:41.080> with<00:03:41.260> rhinos<00:03:41.650> I<00:03:41.890> found<00:03:42.220> the

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
going into Robox with rhinos I found the

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.860 
going into Robox with rhinos I found the
Shelby<00:03:42.640> to<00:03:42.760> be<00:03:42.880> a<00:03:42.910> bit<00:03:43.150> more<00:03:43.269> heavier<00:03:43.570> than<00:03:43.780> the

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
Shelby to be a bit more heavier than the

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.170 
Shelby to be a bit more heavier than the
box<00:03:44.080> but<00:03:44.470> both<00:03:44.620> of<00:03:44.650> them<00:03:44.920> are<00:03:45.280> just<00:03:45.519> almost<00:03:45.850> the

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
box but both of them are just almost the

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.630 
box but both of them are just almost the
same<00:03:46.480> heavy<00:03:49.739> alright<00:03:50.739> and<00:03:50.980> for<00:03:51.130> the<00:03:51.250> moment<00:03:51.430> of

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
same heavy alright and for the moment of

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.259 
same heavy alright and for the moment of
truth<00:03:51.940> are<00:03:52.239> 0<00:03:52.600> to<00:03:52.810> 60<00:03:53.170> test<00:03:53.440> the<00:03:54.100> boss<00:03:54.310> gets<00:03:55.030> to

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
truth are 0 to 60 test the boss gets to

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.080 
truth are 0 to 60 test the boss gets to
point<00:03:55.540> 45<00:03:56.140> seconds<00:03:56.709> and<00:03:56.830> the<00:03:57.040> Shelby<00:03:57.430> gets<00:03:57.850> to

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
point 45 seconds and the Shelby gets to

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.509 
point 45 seconds and the Shelby gets to
point<00:03:58.330> 55<00:03:58.930> seconds<00:03:59.410> and<00:03:59.709> that's<00:04:00.250> pretty<00:04:00.400> good

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
point 55 seconds and that's pretty good

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.750 
point 55 seconds and that's pretty good
acceleration<00:04:01.360> and<00:04:02.310> for<00:04:03.310> the<00:04:03.400> final<00:04:03.610> touch

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
acceleration and for the final touch

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.000 
acceleration and for the final touch
some<00:04:04.150> drags<00:04:04.450> at<00:04:04.690> Rock<00:04:04.930> point<00:04:05.260> and<00:04:05.410> runway<00:04:05.739> and

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
some drags at Rock point and runway and

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.830 
some drags at Rock point and runway and
the<00:04:06.400> good<00:04:06.580> thing<00:04:06.700> about<00:04:06.790> these<00:04:07.090> 2<00:04:07.269> cars<00:04:07.510> is<00:04:07.720> it

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
the good thing about these 2 cars is it

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.570 
the good thing about these 2 cars is it
has<00:04:07.989> six<00:04:08.230> gears<00:04:08.530> and<00:04:08.830> I<00:04:08.980> already<00:04:09.130> make<00:04:09.370> some

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
has six gears and I already make some

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:10.380 
has six gears and I already make some
good<00:04:09.700> for<00:04:09.880> drags

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
good for drags

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.540 
good for drags
even<00:04:10.840> though<00:04:10.989> they<00:04:11.110> have<00:04:11.260> very<00:04:11.290> weak<00:04:11.769> nitro<00:04:12.220> it

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
even though they have very weak nitro it

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.280 
even though they have very weak nitro it
still<00:04:12.880> makes<00:04:13.030> them<00:04:13.180> good<00:04:13.330> for<00:04:13.510> drag<00:04:13.690> the<00:04:14.080> only

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
still makes them good for drag the only

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.750 
still makes them good for drag the only
problem<00:04:14.680> is<00:04:14.800> you<00:04:15.040> don't<00:04:15.190> want<00:04:15.310> to<00:04:15.340> use<00:04:15.550> either

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760
