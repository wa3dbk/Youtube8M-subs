00:00:00.779 --> 00:00:03.779
 thank you 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.410
 his talent for the first grand prix of France of 150 cubic centimeters in 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.469
 Spain in Canada 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:13.909
 he's fighting on the circuit 

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:17.070
 the tracks are transformed immediately we did not know what we say 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:20.929
 easy then to find his marks and his trajectory 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.039
 simply on the way to a rebellion 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.159
 but in this case it is to be first 

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:30.859
 to avoid the projections of the other groups 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.300
 that's what stéphane mistake on the reigning world champion has in mind 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.300
 it's a real second 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.440
 10th position 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.790
 sebastian tortelli is this the return 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.430
 successful in grand prix 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.020
 more than six months after breaking a vertebra 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.830
 the french publicis 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.510
 nothing lost in value 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.510
 but his determination 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.460
 the results to more mixed for other tricolor it is cultivated of maria 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.600
 achieved a good first run finishing 4th 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.600
 but give up in the second 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.470
 difficult of this category 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.340
 for mickaël maschio number 47 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.720
 for the fourteenth place on the entire event after having 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.160
 pronounced in the first leg 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.410
 Discussions are ongoing 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.500
 for frederic bolley 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.940
 in third position here 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.330
 but who falls several times in the Spanish mud it comes back so 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.330
 empty of this first grand prize 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.679
 it took money needed to make it slip 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:38.479
 it is obviously the logical favorite of this season 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.950
 third session 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.399
 I have the impression that humans three or four months of offseason not here 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:48.320
 it's Nazi 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.840
 9 5 m because I kept the same level at the end of season 316 and that's a 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.620
 good news for me it did not calm down bad for others 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.710
 pilots to have invested 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.030
 the other riders will try to take their revenge this afternoon 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.320
 on the occasion of the grand prix of portugal
