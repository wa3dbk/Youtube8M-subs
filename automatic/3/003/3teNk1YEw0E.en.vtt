and<00:01:17.369> as<00:01:17.970> used<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.750> tell<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.110> which<00:01:19.259> way<00:01:19.439> the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
and as used to tell you which way the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.740 
and as used to tell you which way the
wind<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:19.890> blowing<00:01:20.030> so<00:01:21.030> then<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.270> remembered

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
wind is blowing so then I remembered

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.390 
wind is blowing so then I remembered
where<00:01:21.960> I'd<00:01:22.140> actually<00:01:22.320> seen<00:01:22.740> another<00:01:23.070> wind

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
where I'd actually seen another wind

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.429 
where I'd actually seen another wind
sock<00:01:23.670> on<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:23.939> call<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.420> duty<00:01:24.689> game<00:01:24.869> before<00:01:25.259> and

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
sock on a call of duty game before and

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.080 
sock on a call of duty game before and
it<00:01:25.500> was<00:01:25.560> actually<00:01:25.770> dome<00:01:26.220> on<00:01:26.430> modern<00:01:26.700> warfare<00:01:26.880> 3

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
it was actually dome on modern warfare 3

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.880 
it was actually dome on modern warfare 3
you<00:01:27.390> can<00:01:27.570> see<00:01:27.750> right<00:01:27.780> at<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.259> top<00:01:28.439> there<00:01:28.710> and

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
you can see right at the top there and

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.830 
you can see right at the top there and
I've<00:01:29.220> actually<00:01:29.369> circled<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.450> thought<00:01:30.689> to

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
I've actually circled it so I thought to

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.020 
I've actually circled it so I thought to
myself<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.380> research<00:01:31.799> where<00:01:32.520> does<00:01:32.759> dome

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
myself and a research where does dome

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.420 
myself and a research where does dome
actually<00:01:33.450> take<00:01:33.689> place<00:01:33.720> then<00:01:34.259> so<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.130> says<00:01:35.280> that

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
actually take place then so it says that

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.340 
actually take place then so it says that
dome<00:01:35.670> takes<00:01:36.000> place<00:01:36.270> in<00:01:36.479> an<00:01:36.570> abandoned<00:01:37.110> NATO

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
dome takes place in an abandoned NATO

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.230 
dome takes place in an abandoned NATO
military<00:01:37.740> outpost<00:01:38.490> in<00:01:38.640> an<00:01:38.790> unknown<00:01:39.180> location

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
military outpost in an unknown location

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.289 
military outpost in an unknown location
in<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.110> Middle<00:01:40.380> East<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:41.070> started<00:01:41.640> as<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.850> cold

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
in the Middle East it started as a cold

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.319 
in the Middle East it started as a cold
war-era<00:01:42.720> desert<00:01:43.350> radar<00:01:43.770> commander<00:01:44.310> bunker<00:01:44.729> so

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
war-era desert radar commander bunker so

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.730 
war-era desert radar commander bunker so
going<00:01:45.570> back<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.960> image<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.290> looking<00:01:46.619> at

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
going back to the image and looking at

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.200 
going back to the image and looking at
that<00:01:46.829> wind<00:01:47.070> stop<00:01:47.310> we've<00:01:47.460> got<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.640> load<00:01:48.000> of

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
that wind stop we've got a load of

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.120 
that wind stop we've got a load of
locations<00:01:49.079> where<00:01:49.290> this<00:01:49.470> map<00:01:49.740> could<00:01:49.950> now

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
locations where this map could now

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.859 
locations where this map could now
actually<00:01:50.520> take<00:01:50.759> place<00:01:50.790> we've<00:01:51.180> got<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.360> military

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
actually take place we've got a military

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.569 
actually take place we've got a military
outpost<00:01:51.930> we've<00:01:52.500> got<00:01:52.649> an<00:01:52.740> airport<00:01:53.070> we've<00:01:53.460> got

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
outpost we've got an airport we've got

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.550 
outpost we've got an airport we've got
all<00:01:53.759> your<00:01:53.880> rigs<00:01:54.149> we<00:01:54.299> got<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.450> load<00:01:54.810> of<00:01:55.049> different

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
all your rigs we got a load of different

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.560 
all your rigs we got a load of different
places<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.340> if<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.820> think<00:01:56.850> I'm<00:01:57.180> talking<00:01:57.509> a

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
places and if you think I'm talking a

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.940 
places and if you think I'm talking a
load<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.810> rubbish<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.110> all<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.500> stuff<00:01:58.649> then

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
load of rubbish and all that stuff then

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.530 
load of rubbish and all that stuff then
think<00:01:59.189> about<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.640> why<00:01:59.759> would<00:01:59.790> you<00:02:00.119> just<00:02:00.299> post

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
think about it why would you just post

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.690 
think about it why would you just post
the<00:02:00.659> win<00:02:00.869> stock<00:02:01.170> right<00:02:01.439> there<00:02:01.680> it's<00:02:02.070> right<00:02:02.250> at

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
the win stock right there it's right at

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.639 
the win stock right there it's right at
the<00:02:02.790> front<00:02:02.939> of<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.240> images<00:02:03.630> basically<00:02:04.469> just

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
the front of the images basically just

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.530 
the front of the images basically just
standing<00:02:05.100> up<00:02:05.189> more<00:02:05.520> than<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.850> main<00:02:06.030> character

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
standing up more than the main character

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.029 
standing up more than the main character
so<00:02:06.719> why<00:02:06.899> would<00:02:07.110> they<00:02:07.229> actually<00:02:07.560> place<00:02:07.770> that

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
so why would they actually place that

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.309 
so why would they actually place that
there<00:02:08.250> okay<00:02:09.119> so<00:02:09.179> there's<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.569> few<00:02:09.660> possible

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
there okay so there's a few possible

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.380 
there okay so there's a few possible
locations<00:02:11.009> just<00:02:11.700> from<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:12.120> bit<00:02:12.360> of

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
locations just from that bit of

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.110 
locations just from that bit of
information

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
information

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.610 
information
now<00:02:13.330> from<00:02:13.569> the<00:02:13.659> windsock<00:02:14.049> where<00:02:14.260> this<00:02:14.409> map

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
now from the windsock where this map

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.140 
now from the windsock where this map
could<00:02:14.799> actually<00:02:14.920> take<00:02:15.250> place<00:02:15.280> but<00:02:15.700> I<00:02:15.730> went<00:02:15.970> on

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
could actually take place but I went on

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.020 
could actually take place but I went on
to<00:02:16.299> look<00:02:16.420> at<00:02:16.540> this<00:02:16.659> image<00:02:16.870> even<00:02:17.470> deeper<00:02:18.250> so<00:02:19.000> I

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
to look at this image even deeper so I

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.610 
to look at this image even deeper so I
could<00:02:19.299> said<00:02:19.450> going<00:02:19.750> on<00:02:19.870> deeper<00:02:20.260> into<00:02:20.500> this

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
could said going on deeper into this

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.470 
could said going on deeper into this
image<00:02:20.950> sounds<00:02:21.340> wrong<00:02:21.580> there<00:02:21.790> but<00:02:22.090> I've

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
image sounds wrong there but I've

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.240 
image sounds wrong there but I've
actually<00:02:22.780> highlighted<00:02:23.500> several<00:02:23.739> trees<00:02:24.099> we've

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
actually highlighted several trees we've

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.680 
actually highlighted several trees we've
got<00:02:24.370> trees<00:02:24.580> to<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.700> left<00:02:24.940> to<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.239> right<00:02:25.330> and

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
got trees to the left to the right and

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.660 
got trees to the left to the right and
to<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:26.500> tree<00:02:26.799> to<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.040> left<00:02:27.129> the<00:02:27.549> one

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
to the tree to the left the one

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.759 
to the tree to the left the one
specifically<00:02:28.239> I've<00:02:28.420> located<00:02:28.659> with<00:02:29.200> three

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
specifically I've located with three

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.680 
specifically I've located with three
arrows<00:02:30.159> going<00:02:30.250> to<00:02:30.549> that<00:02:30.700> one<00:02:30.909> tree<00:02:31.180> that<00:02:31.360> tree

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
arrows going to that one tree that tree

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.569 
arrows going to that one tree that tree
actually<00:02:31.989> looks<00:02:32.440> to<00:02:32.530> be<00:02:32.650> a<00:02:32.680> palm<00:02:32.980> tree<00:02:33.310> because

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:33.579 
actually looks to be a palm tree because

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:35.100 
actually looks to be a palm tree because
it's<00:02:33.730> got<00:02:33.849> you<00:02:34.000> know<00:02:34.030> several<00:02:34.450> leads<00:02:34.810> coming

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
it's got you know several leads coming

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.930 
it's got you know several leads coming
off<00:02:35.260> it<00:02:35.440> actually<00:02:35.709> Lou<00:02:36.250> cut<00:02:36.430> it<00:02:36.549> looks<00:02:36.819> like

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
off it actually Lou cut it looks like

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.850 
off it actually Lou cut it looks like
it's<00:02:37.120> got<00:02:37.209> spikes<00:02:37.659> coming<00:02:37.959> off<00:02:38.170> it<00:02:38.319> so<00:02:38.470> it

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
it's got spikes coming off it so it

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.170 
it's got spikes coming off it so it
looks<00:02:39.040> to<00:02:39.159> be<00:02:39.190> something<00:02:39.519> similar<00:02:40.000> to<00:02:40.030> the

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
looks to be something similar to the

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.610 
looks to be something similar to the
palm<00:02:40.420> tree<00:02:40.690> or<00:02:40.840> it<00:02:40.959> could<00:02:41.140> actually<00:02:41.290> be<00:02:41.470> the

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
palm tree or it could actually be the

iary<00:04:15.010> the<00:04:15.310> airport<00:04:15.879> this<00:04:16.269> could<00:04:16.449> still<00:04:16.690> fit<00:04:16.959> in

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
iary the airport this could still fit in

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:18.839 
iary the airport this could still fit in
with<00:04:17.320> all<00:04:17.530> them<00:04:17.769> location<00:04:18.400> to<00:04:18.549> know<00:04:18.669> that

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:18.849 
with all them location to know that

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:20.490 
with all them location to know that
could<00:04:18.940> be<00:04:19.060> an<00:04:19.150> airport<00:04:19.570> behind<00:04:19.930> us<00:04:20.109> summit<00:04:20.349> I'm

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
could be an airport behind us summit I'm

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.649 
could be an airport behind us summit I'm
not<00:04:20.799> too<00:04:20.949> short<00:04:21.130> could<00:04:21.340> still<00:04:21.549> fit<00:04:21.760> in<00:04:21.940> so<00:04:22.479> what

00:04:22.649 --> 00:04:22.659 
not too short could still fit in so what

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:24.209 
not too short could still fit in so what
I<00:04:22.690> did<00:04:22.810> then<00:04:23.080> was<00:04:23.110> actually<00:04:23.620> went<00:04:23.830> back<00:04:24.039> to

00:04:24.209 --> 00:04:24.219 
I did then was actually went back to

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:25.680 
I did then was actually went back to
this<00:04:24.370> little<00:04:24.550> trailer<00:04:25.000> that<00:04:25.240> we<00:04:25.360> got<00:04:25.539> this

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
this little trailer that we got this

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:26.640 
this little trailer that we got this
behind-the-scenes<00:04:26.140> tree

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
behind-the-scenes tree

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.469 
behind-the-scenes tree
that<00:04:26.860> we<00:04:26.949> got<00:04:27.130> off<00:04:27.280> black<00:04:27.610> ops<00:04:27.820> 2<00:04:28.000> and<00:04:28.240> they

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
that we got off black ops 2 and they

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:30.180 
that we got off black ops 2 and they
actually<00:04:28.810> showed<00:04:28.990> a<00:04:29.020> little<00:04:29.229> clip<00:04:29.590> of<00:04:29.770> zombies

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
actually showed a little clip of zombies

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.010 
actually showed a little clip of zombies
in<00:04:30.310> development<00:04:30.850> and<00:04:31.000> I<00:04:31.389> took<00:04:31.449> a<00:04:31.720> screenshot

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
in development and I took a screenshot

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.439 
in development and I took a screenshot
of<00:04:32.320> the<00:04:32.530> map<00:04:32.770> and<00:04:33.250> to<00:04:33.699> be<00:04:33.790> honest<00:04:34.090> these

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:34.449 
of the map and to be honest these

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:36.360 
of the map and to be honest these
screenshots<00:04:34.900> don't<00:04:35.440> fit<00:04:35.680> in<00:04:35.830> with<00:04:36.009> the<00:04:36.130> black

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
we can't see some trees but I can't see

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.320 
we can't see some trees but I can't see
any<00:04:47.020> specific<00:04:47.680> palm<00:04:47.919> trees<00:04:48.250> going<00:04:48.970> back<00:04:49.180> to

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
any specific palm trees going back to

any specific palm trees going back to
that<00:04:49.360> image<00:04:49.690> on<00:04:49.930> the<00:04:50.199> right<00:04:50.380> there<00:04:50.650> we<00:04:50.770> can

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
that image on the right there we can

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:52.740 
that image on the right there we can
actually<00:04:50.919> see<00:04:51.430> what<00:04:51.610> Luke<00:04:51.880> to<00:04:52.030> be<00:04:52.120> some<00:04:52.330> normal

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
actually see what Luke to be some normal

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.840 
actually see what Luke to be some normal
trees<00:04:52.960> maybe<00:04:53.229> but<00:04:53.860> on<00:04:53.979> the<00:04:54.100> Left<00:04:54.310> I<00:04:54.460> can't<00:04:54.699> see

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
trees maybe but on the Left I can't see

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.999 
trees maybe but on the Left I can't see
any<00:04:54.970> palm<00:04:55.240> trees<00:04:55.539> any<00:04:55.720> trees<00:04:56.050> that<00:04:56.530> really<00:04:56.860> do

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:57.009 
any palm trees any trees that really do

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:59.460 
any palm trees any trees that really do
look<00:04:57.220> like<00:04:57.430> that<00:04:57.720> again<00:04:58.720> with<00:04:58.870> the<00:04:59.020> buildings

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
look like that again with the buildings

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.230 
look like that again with the buildings
these<00:04:59.710> buildings<00:05:00.160> really<00:05:00.430> don't<00:05:00.760> look<00:05:00.910> tall

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
these buildings really don't look tall

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.240 
these buildings really don't look tall
enough<00:05:01.479> to<00:05:01.690> be<00:05:01.960> the<00:05:02.199> same<00:05:02.410> as<00:05:02.560> that<00:05:02.710> image<00:05:03.039> they

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
enough to be the same as that image they

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.340 
enough to be the same as that image they
don't<00:05:03.430> look<00:05:03.639> the<00:05:03.789> same<00:05:03.820> and<00:05:04.300> the<00:05:04.750> other<00:05:04.930> image

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
don't look the same and the other image

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.260 
don't look the same and the other image
we<00:05:05.470> could<00:05:05.620> see<00:05:05.800> some<00:05:05.830> really<00:05:06.520> tall<00:05:06.729> buildings

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
we could see some really tall buildings

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.060 
we could see some really tall buildings
in<00:05:07.419> the<00:05:07.539> background<00:05:07.570> there<00:05:08.080> and<00:05:08.260> this<00:05:08.680> doesn't

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
in the background there and this doesn't

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.800 
in the background there and this doesn't
look<00:05:09.130> like<00:05:09.190> the<00:05:09.490> place<00:05:09.699> to<00:05:09.910> be<00:05:10.060> where<00:05:10.510> we<00:05:10.690> would

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
look like the place to be where we would

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.510 
look like the place to be where we would
actually<00:05:11.139> find<00:05:11.350> some<00:05:11.560> really<00:05:11.770> tall<00:05:12.039> buildings

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
actually find some really tall buildings

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.070 
actually find some really tall buildings
you<00:05:12.610> know<00:05:12.639> this<00:05:12.910> looks<00:05:13.090> to<00:05:13.300> just<00:05:13.510> be<00:05:13.630> a<00:05:13.660> smaller

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
you know this looks to just be a smaller

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.040 
you know this looks to just be a smaller
town<00:05:14.830> or<00:05:15.070> village<00:05:15.100> and<00:05:15.669> finally<00:05:16.570> again<00:05:16.870> with

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
town or village and finally again with

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.810 
town or village and finally again with
the<00:05:17.199> windsock<00:05:17.680> do<00:05:17.979> you<00:05:18.099> think<00:05:18.400> you'd<00:05:18.550> really

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
the windsock do you think you'd really

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.089 
the windsock do you think you'd really
actually<00:05:19.150> find<00:05:19.599> a<00:05:19.720> winsock<00:05:20.199> in<00:05:20.440> a<00:05:20.830> town<00:05:21.070> or

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:21.099 
actually find a winsock in a town or

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:22.980 
actually find a winsock in a town or
village<00:05:21.280> why<00:05:21.729> would<00:05:21.940> a<00:05:21.970> windsock<00:05:22.419> be<00:05:22.599> here<00:05:22.810> I'm

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
village why would a windsock be here I'm

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.439 
village why would a windsock be here I'm
not<00:05:23.169> really<00:05:23.349> too<00:05:23.650> sure<00:05:23.970> so<00:05:24.970> again<00:05:25.210> here's

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:25.449 
not really too sure so again here's

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:27.510 
not really too sure so again here's
another<00:05:25.780> screenshot<00:05:26.259> from<00:05:26.919> that<00:05:27.220> same

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
another screenshot from that same

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.310 
another screenshot from that same
behind-the-scenes<00:05:28.330> trailer<00:05:28.660> again<00:05:28.870> we<00:05:29.169> can

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
behind-the-scenes trailer again we can

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.870 
behind-the-scenes trailer again we can
see<00:05:29.470> what<00:05:29.590> the<00:05:29.650> buildings<00:05:30.070> the<00:05:30.220> older<00:05:30.610> to<00:05:30.789> be

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
see what the buildings the older to be

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.490 
see what the buildings the older to be
too<00:05:31.060> small<00:05:31.330> but<00:05:31.479> we<00:05:31.599> can't<00:05:31.810> actually<00:05:31.930> see<00:05:32.320> a

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
too small but we can't actually see a

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.770 
too small but we can't actually see a
church<00:05:33.250> on<00:05:33.610> the<00:05:33.789> left<00:05:34.030> there<00:05:34.240> you<00:05:34.360> know<00:05:34.510> maybe

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
church on the left there you know maybe

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.659 
church on the left there you know maybe
that<00:05:35.050> could<00:05:35.260> fit<00:05:35.530> in<00:05:35.680> going<00:05:36.280> back<00:05:36.340> to<00:05:36.490> that

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:36.669 
that could fit in going back to that

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:38.370 
that could fit in going back to that
image<00:05:37.030> we<00:05:37.210> could<00:05:37.510> actually<00:05:37.660> see<00:05:38.050> to<00:05:38.229> the<00:05:38.349> left

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
image we could actually see to the left

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.409 
image we could actually see to the left
there<00:05:38.710> was<00:05:38.800> a<00:05:38.830> really<00:05:39.250> tall<00:05:39.430> building<00:05:39.880> and<00:05:40.330> you

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:40.419 
there was a really tall building and you

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:42.000 
there was a really tall building and you

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
maybe you know this map could be massive

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.930 
maybe you know this map could be massive
and<00:05:43.840> really<00:05:44.440> just<00:05:44.590> seen<00:05:44.860> half<00:05:45.159> of<00:05:45.370> it<00:05:45.550> maybe<00:05:45.729> we

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940 
and really just seen half of it maybe we

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.580 
and really just seen half of it maybe we
could<00:05:46.120> see<00:05:46.270> the<00:05:46.360> other<00:05:46.510> half<00:05:46.810> and<00:05:47.080> that<00:05:47.409> could

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 
could see the other half and that could

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:49.740 
could see the other half and that could
actually<00:05:47.710> link<00:05:48.490> him<00:05:48.699> with<00:05:48.729> the<00:05:49.060> screenshot

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 
but if you look at these trees again the

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.820 
but if you look at these trees again the
olap<00:05:52.449> to<00:05:52.570> be<00:05:52.690> normal<00:05:52.960> trees<00:05:53.320> you<00:05:53.470> can't<00:05:53.650> really

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
olap to be normal trees you can't really

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.100 
olap to be normal trees you can't really
see<00:05:53.949> any<00:05:54.190> palm<00:05:54.460> trees<00:05:54.760> but<00:05:55.030> all<00:05:55.419> the<00:05:55.840> trees

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:05.320 
buildings if we go back to the screen

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.740 
buildings if we go back to the screen
shot<00:06:05.380> you<00:06:05.919> can<00:06:06.070> see<00:06:06.130> that<00:06:06.490> all<00:06:06.729> the<00:06:07.120> trees<00:06:07.419> are

below<00:06:08.500> the<00:06:08.530> buildings<00:06:09.130> you<00:06:09.250> can<00:06:09.310> see<00:06:09.610> that

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:09.639 
below the buildings you can see that

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:11.310 
below the buildings you can see that
they're<00:06:09.909> all<00:06:10.030> under<00:06:10.300> the<00:06:10.449> buildings<00:06:10.930> none<00:06:11.199> of

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 
they're all under the buildings none of

they're all under the buildings none of
them<00:06:11.500> are<00:06:11.680> above<00:06:12.190> so<00:06:12.370> again<00:06:12.669> this<00:06:12.880> screenshot

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
them are above so again this screenshot

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.360 
them are above so again this screenshot

doesn't really link him with the other
image<00:06:15.820> I<00:06:15.970> showed<00:06:16.000> you<00:06:16.360> before<00:06:16.479> all<00:06:16.870> the<00:06:17.050> trees

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:17.289 
image I showed you before all the trees

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:19.170 
image I showed you before all the trees
are<00:06:17.470> too<00:06:17.620> tall<00:06:17.919> in<00:06:18.190> this<00:06:18.370> screenshot<00:06:18.729> and

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
are too tall in this screenshot and

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.330 
are too tall in this screenshot and
again<00:06:19.990> just<00:06:20.199> looking<00:06:20.590> at<00:06:20.680> it<00:06:20.710> as<00:06:20.889> a<00:06:21.039> little

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:21.340 
again just looking at it as a little

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:22.980 
again just looking at it as a little
town<00:06:21.639> it's<00:06:21.849> all<00:06:21.970> or<00:06:22.090> village<00:06:22.360> do<00:06:22.539> you<00:06:22.630> really

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:22.990 
town it's all or village do you really

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:24.810 
town it's all or village do you really
think<00:06:23.229> you'd<00:06:23.349> actually<00:06:23.470> find<00:06:23.979> a<00:06:24.099> windsock<00:06:24.580> in

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:24.820 
think you'd actually find a windsock in

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.240 
think you'd actually find a windsock in
this<00:06:25.419> setting<00:06:26.080> I'd<00:06:26.349> really<00:06:26.710> don't<00:06:26.889> think<00:06:26.979> I

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:27.250 
this setting I'd really don't think I

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:28.830 
this setting I'd really don't think I
would<00:06:27.460> so<00:06:27.940> that's<00:06:28.090> it<00:06:28.210> guys<00:06:28.270> would<00:06:28.599> come<00:06:28.690> to

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:46.030 
map is gonna be massive and it's gonna

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.059 
map is gonna be massive and it's gonna
be<00:06:46.120> one<00:06:46.479> of<00:06:46.569> the<00:06:46.659> biggest<00:06:46.960> zombie<00:06:47.469> maps<00:06:47.680> that

00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:48.069 
be one of the biggest zombie maps that

00:06:48.069 --> 00:06:49.409 
be one of the biggest zombie maps that
you've<00:06:48.250> ever<00:06:48.400> made<00:06:48.610> so<00:06:48.879> you<00:06:48.939> know<00:06:49.120> we<00:06:49.270> could

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:49.419 
you've ever made so you know we could

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:51.209 
you've ever made so you know we could
only<00:06:49.629> be<00:06:49.810> seen<00:06:50.020> half<00:06:50.500> of<00:06:50.710> the<00:06:50.800> tongue<00:06:51.009> but<00:06:51.189> I

00:06:51.209 --> 00:06:51.219 
only be seen half of the tongue but I

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:52.950 
only be seen half of the tongue but I
really<00:06:51.610> don't<00:06:51.789> think<00:06:51.879> that<00:06:52.300> it<00:06:52.599> is<00:06:52.689> actually

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:52.960 
really don't think that it is actually

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.540 
really don't think that it is actually
the<00:06:53.259> same<00:06:53.500> zombies<00:06:53.889> map<00:06:54.069> that's<00:06:54.250> what<00:06:54.460> I'm

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:54.550 
the same zombies map that's what I'm

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:55.800 
the same zombies map that's what I'm
trying<00:06:54.669> to<00:06:54.819> get<00:06:54.939> across<00:06:55.030> a<00:06:55.270> think<00:06:55.599> that<00:06:55.689> we're

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:55.810 
trying to get across a think that we're

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:57.570 
trying to get across a think that we're
actually<00:06:55.960> seeing<00:06:56.289> two<00:06:56.800> different<00:06:56.830> zombies

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:57.580 
actually seeing two different zombies

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.100 
actually seeing two different zombies
maps<00:06:57.759> here<00:06:57.939> you<00:06:58.120> know<00:06:58.210> this<00:06:58.449> screenshot<00:06:58.780> is

00:06:59.100 --> 00:06:59.110

one<00:06:59.620> and<00:06:59.830> then<00:07:00.159> them<00:07:00.340> to<00:07:00.550> behind-the-scenes

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:01.240 
one and then them to behind-the-scenes

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.999 
one and then them to behind-the-scenes
screenshots<00:07:01.780> that's<00:07:02.229> another<00:07:02.620> map<00:07:02.889> because

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:04.449 
it doesn't link up I don't think we'd

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:06.420 
it doesn't link up I don't think we'd
actually<00:07:04.479> see<00:07:04.900> a<00:07:04.930> windsock<00:07:05.469> and<00:07:05.710> then<00:07:06.129> behind

you<00:07:09.250> know<00:07:09.400> guys<00:07:09.610> I<00:07:09.819> think<00:07:10.030> this<00:07:10.150> one<00:07:10.360> could<00:07:10.389> be

00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:10.599 
you know guys I think this one could be

00:07:10.599 --> 00:07:12.689 
you know guys I think this one could be
linked<00:07:10.990> into<00:07:11.259> a<00:07:11.289> you<00:07:12.009> know<00:07:12.129> a<00:07:12.159> possible

00:07:12.689 --> 00:07:12.699 
linked into a you know a possible

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:14.339 
linked into a you know a possible
airport<00:07:13.300> you<00:07:13.360> know<00:07:13.479> the<00:07:13.599> airport<00:07:13.780> could<00:07:14.139> be<00:07:14.229> at

00:07:14.339 --> 00:07:14.349 
airport you know the airport could be at

00:07:14.349 --> 00:07:15.510 
airport you know the airport could be at
the<00:07:14.409> front<00:07:14.620> than<00:07:14.740> behind<00:07:15.069> we<00:07:15.190> got<00:07:15.340> some

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:15.520 
the front than behind we got some

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.369 
the front than behind we got some
buildings<00:07:15.969> you<00:07:16.090> know<00:07:16.240> somewhat<00:07:16.599> similar<00:07:17.169> that

00:07:17.369 --> 00:07:17.379 
buildings you know somewhat similar that

00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:19.469 
buildings you know somewhat similar that
then<00:07:17.560> them<00:07:17.770> to<00:07:17.979> behind<00:07:18.550> the<00:07:18.669> screen<00:07:18.969> screen

00:07:19.469 --> 00:07:19.479 
then them to behind the screen screen

00:07:19.479 --> 00:07:21.689 
then them to behind the screen screen
shots<00:07:19.990> so<00:07:20.650> that's<00:07:20.919> hard<00:07:21.099> to<00:07:21.190> get<00:07:21.280> across<00:07:21.430> them

00:07:21.689 --> 00:07:21.699 
shots so that's hard to get across them

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:23.730 
shots so that's hard to get across them
to<00:07:21.909> could<00:07:22.180> be<00:07:22.330> you<00:07:22.930> know<00:07:23.050> from<00:07:23.259> the<00:07:23.319> village

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:23.740 
to could be you know from the village

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.709 
to could be you know from the village
from<00:07:23.860> another<00:07:24.159> map<00:07:24.400> so<00:07:25.180> that's<00:07:25.330> it<00:07:25.509> for<00:07:25.539> this

00:07:25.709 --> 00:07:25.719 
from another map so that's it for this

00:07:25.719 --> 00:07:27.029 
from another map so that's it for this
