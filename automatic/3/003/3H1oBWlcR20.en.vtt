00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.139
 to me 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.320
 hello youtube friends here is a new 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.210
 received gamer welcome to the analysis 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.520
 of the pokemon mini this console 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.730
 belongs to the sixth generation and was 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.290
 launched in 2001 has the banner 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.090
 of being the smallest laptop in 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.040
 interchangeable cartridges of all 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.839
 record videogame history that 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.180
 maintains even today because I think 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:43.220
 that can not be overcome good not 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.839
 You will be able to exceed in size in 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.329
 small that this fact poses as 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:48.710
 keychain here I have a draft that 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:50.659
 it's been a school standard 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.159
 so they can see the size is a bit 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:53.719
 bigger than the eraser but 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:55.809
 it's just to give me the 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.800
 size of the console and how small it is 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.780
 as you can see the console is very 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.090
 similar to a game boy because it has a 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.679
 crosshead that works very well although it is 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.119
 very small and the finger almost the top 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:07.490
 completely when you put it on top 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.530
 but if it works perfectly here 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.210
 has the power button here is the 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.210
 reset button to recite the console 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.220
 the button and the button sees this corner that 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.350
 has led out to be able to put 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.350
 a cable or a strap and hang it 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.650
 your waist young the keychain 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.670
 on one side we have the ce button 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.350
 I honestly do not know why it works 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.750
 on this side we have absolutely no 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.640
 nothing on the bottom part either 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.740
 we have nothing on the top 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.600
 we have the entrance of the cartridges that 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.850
 are similar to those of bs but they are a 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.850
 little bit smaller and the infrared 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.560
 to be able to play two players here 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.590
 in the back we have the button 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.299
 a wok for him the cartridge as you put it 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.230
 and to be able to take out you have to make them 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.390
 here to the right 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.550
 here is the battery compartment 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.070
 that lacks the pinche tapa de las 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.150
 piles like a beggar like the beggar 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.770
 urban legend that had already risen 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.300
 previously I do not know why it 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.580
 they lose the covers even this one 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.070
 I was screwed honestly I do not know 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.140
 why my legs fuck me 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.330
 shitload of courage because the truth is 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.800
 horrible laptops like this but this one 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.840
 It's so weird that I had to grab it 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.570
 even because the heart is very cheap 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.220
 but that we go later here they are 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.920
 the specifications I'm going to take out for 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.350
 that can see pokemon mini model 001 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.390
 in 2001 as he told them made in china 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.550
 and half and a half here is the speaker 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.470
 As you can see, it's very similar to 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.880
 those that have the game watch is sometimes 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.520
 that is not of very good quality that 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.900
 let's say and logically here is where 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.120
 They go the batteries that I had already told them 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.060
 uses a triple stack only to 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.890
 to be able to operate the entrance to 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.320
 cartridges as I tell you is very similar to 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.580
 those of that I do not have and are not in those 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.320
 moments a cartridge to be able 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.510
 show the lights is that I'm going to 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.160
 leave an image of the graphics and a 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.570
 cartridge so they can see them and 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.570
 know them in case they did not know them 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.939
 good to finish an excellent 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.560
 console in its size because from there in 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:07.260
 outside, it really surprises us in 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.640
 nothing is as if it were a tamagotchi 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.260
 remastered simply nintendo 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.170
 attempt is going to be the smallest part 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.329
 but it does not work out as they wanted 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.640
 honestly this is a console that was 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:20.680
 thrown like that simply also because the 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.470
 game boy advance was next and it's very 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.819
 very much superior to this thing the only 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.640
 advantage that you have is consolidated and 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.680
 it's being the size the console is 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.720
 extremely rare if you get to know 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.569
 to garland immediately because you do not go 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.510
 to see again is never very scarce 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:39.670
 you can buy the very expensive internet 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.170
 I got 10 pesos in the chacha 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.780
 of the knows wheels already know where I 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.489
 I'm pitifully have the bad di 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.920
 damn curse of the cover of the 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.720
 batteries but as I tell you this console 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.340
 grab it works does not work against 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.230
 parents of batteries or uncovered is battery powered 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.430
 because it is very very scarce 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.720
 Well I hope you liked this 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.970
 analysis I have nothing more to say 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.620
 because the console features 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.689
 scanty games that are simply 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.209
 some like the pokemon party post 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:06.069
 pokemon mini and pokemon pinball are almost 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.510
 a little bit of fact they are pure games of 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:08.480
 poker 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.519
 they are being like mini games 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.810
 well we started this video I hope that 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.810
 you liked it , see you
