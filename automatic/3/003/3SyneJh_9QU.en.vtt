00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.350
 the previous liter if you believe in our 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:10.469

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.469

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.320
 today in k-2 the conquest 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.720
 mountaineering is perhaps the only sport 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:35.370
 that allows you to get there on your own 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.370
 to the closest to heaven 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.680
 to the highest point of the planet 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.700
 It's a really claimant proves it 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.590
 the weather conditions to which 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.320
 face the climbers are 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.750
 really inhuman benjamin salazar

 He knows what he faces in the k2 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.920
 most dangerous mountain in the world 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.290
 If there is freezing, other factors 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.350
 what can happen to you is called a necropsy 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.479
 you die in the tissues they put on you 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.240
 blacks because you have to cut those parts 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.310
 to prevent gangrene and the parts 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.490
 What else you freeze is the nose 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.850
 the ears the fingers of the hands and 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.850
 the feet 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.719
 i 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.719
 Y 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.780
 but it's so much the love of this sport that 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.060
 for him it's worth taking any 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.700
 risk because their interest in mountaineering 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.850
 born since he was very small so 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.850
 the 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.149
 ah 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.020
 at the moment I discovered it is in 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.780
 my state of tlaxcala in my town is 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.480
 saw and looks lix so maniche equality the 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.210
 peak of orizaba and popocatÃ©petl all the 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.720
 mornings I very clear and says how big in 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:26.490
 the mountains and was to bring me to say that 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.070
 will feel to know the snow that is 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.260
 feel to be up there there they start 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.240
 to be that passion youngest is the clear 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.790
 example of dreams becoming 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.130
 reality if one does not stop chasing them 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.750
 Ever asked the elementary school 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.910
 what we wanted to do to you and I told them that 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.910
 I had to climb the everest near 2 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.689

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.689
 It has been his greatest passion
