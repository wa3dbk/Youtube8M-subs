00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
have our lines drawn as a reference

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.310 
have our lines drawn as a reference
marks<00:00:19.980> right<00:00:20.970> along<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.270> edge<00:00:21.300> right<00:00:21.420> here<00:00:21.660> so

right up to your repetir reference eyes

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:11.270 
right up to your repetir reference eyes
don't<00:01:06.509> cover<00:01:06.900> them<00:01:07.050> completely<00:01:07.140> up<00:01:10.190> when<00:01:11.190> you

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
while because you just slow going to get

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:28.639 
while because you just slow going to get
this<00:01:15.690> first<00:01:20.929> this<00:01:21.929> first<00:01:22.259> area<00:01:27.470> there<00:01:28.470> was<00:01:28.619> a

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 
this first this first area there was a

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:31.760 
this first this first area there was a
lump<00:01:29.009> in<00:01:29.190> them<00:01:29.899> in<00:01:30.899> it<00:01:31.050> right<00:01:31.170> there<00:01:31.410> sometime

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
lump in them in it right there sometime

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.219 
lump in them in it right there sometime
to<00:01:31.890> crush<00:01:32.160> them<00:01:32.429> up<00:01:32.580> and<00:01:32.910> mix<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.990> up<00:01:34.080> a<00:01:34.200> little

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
to crush them up and mix it up a little

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:45.620 
to crush them up and mix it up a little
bit<00:01:34.410> just<00:01:34.710> in<00:01:34.830> case<00:01:43.909> just<00:01:44.909> remember<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.300> go<00:01:45.420> up

bit just in case just remember to go up

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.899 
bit just in case just remember to go up
to<00:01:46.110> your<00:01:46.350> reference<00:01:46.710> lines<00:01:46.950> but<00:01:47.369> don't<00:01:47.610> cover

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
to your reference lines but don't cover

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.910 
to your reference lines but don't cover
them<00:01:48.090> up<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:48.569> that<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:48.840> can<00:01:49.020> see<00:01:49.259> them<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:51.920> you

them up so that you can see them and you

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.440 
them up so that you can see them and you
usually<00:01:53.689> say<00:01:54.689> on<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.869> floor<00:01:55.229> you'll<00:01:55.680> have<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:56.450> one

usually say on a floor you'll have a one

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.440 
usually say on a floor you'll have a one
long<00:01:58.189> reference<00:01:59.189> line<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.729> will<00:01:59.970> go<00:02:00.210> through

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
long reference line that will go through

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.710 
long reference line that will go through
the<00:02:00.600> entire<00:02:01.070> house<00:02:02.070> or<00:02:02.640> maybe<00:02:03.060> we'll<00:02:03.420> just<00:02:03.600> go
