boat which gives you the turn for the
motor<00:02:19.970> and<00:02:20.970> then<00:02:21.450> you<00:02:21.540> also<00:02:21.810> have<00:02:22.080> forwards

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
motor and then you also have forwards

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.770 
motor and then you also have forwards
and<00:02:22.860> backwards<00:02:25.010> now<00:02:26.010> this<00:02:26.190> does<00:02:26.540> sit<00:02:27.540> pretty

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
and backwards now this does sit pretty

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.510 
and backwards now this does sit pretty
well<00:02:27.930> on<00:02:28.050> top<00:02:28.230> of<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.470> water<00:02:28.650> which<00:02:29.130> is<00:02:29.310> good

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
well on top of the water which is good

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.210 
well on top of the water which is good
because<00:02:29.670> none<00:02:30.090> of<00:02:30.209> this<00:02:30.300> is<00:02:30.800> waterproof<00:02:31.800> on

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
because none of this is waterproof on

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.730 
because none of this is waterproof on
top<00:02:32.660> water<00:02:33.660> can<00:02:33.840> get<00:02:33.959> right<00:02:34.110> into<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.500> charge

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
top water can get right into the charge

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.760 
top water can get right into the charge
port<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.790> where<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.000> wires<00:02:36.209> come<00:02:36.570> out<00:02:36.770> for

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
port and where the wires come out for

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.080 
port and where the wires come out for
the<00:02:37.860> motor<00:02:38.130> and<00:02:38.660> also<00:02:40.489> where<00:02:41.489> the<00:02:41.610> wires<00:02:41.820> for

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
the motor and also where the wires for

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.380 
the motor and also where the wires for
the<00:02:42.209> servos<00:02:42.600> come<00:02:42.840> out<00:02:42.959> there's<00:02:43.170> a<00:02:43.230> huge<00:02:43.440> hole

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
the servos come out there's a huge hole

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.270 
the servos come out there's a huge hole
so<00:02:45.390> it's<00:02:45.540> definitely<00:02:45.900> you<00:02:46.770> definitely<00:02:46.920> have

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
so it's definitely you definitely have

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.970 
so it's definitely you definitely have
to<00:02:47.370> make<00:02:47.430> sure<00:02:47.670> that<00:02:47.820> this<00:02:47.970> doesn't<00:02:48.209> go

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
to make sure that this doesn't go

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.740 
to make sure that this doesn't go
underneath<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.250> water<00:02:51.980> so<00:02:53.510> let's<00:02:54.510> check<00:02:54.720> it

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
underneath the water so let's check it

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:11.539 
underneath the water so let's check it
out

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:45.929 

and<00:03:12.549> those<00:03:12.760> go<00:03:12.909> away<00:03:44.400> it<00:03:45.400> doesn't<00:03:45.669> have<00:03:45.909> a

00:03:45.929 --> 00:03:45.939 
and those go away it doesn't have a

00:03:45.939 --> 00:04:10.589 
and those go away it doesn't have a
rudder<00:03:46.180> so<00:03:47.189> it<00:03:48.189> pumps<00:03:48.909> tear<00:03:49.150> at<00:03:49.239> all<00:04:09.599> that's

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:10.599 
rudder so it pumps tear at all that's

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:31.290 
rudder so it pumps tear at all that's
pretty<00:04:10.780> straight

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.920 

all<00:04:32.300> right<00:04:32.420> time<00:04:32.600> at<00:04:34.150> six<00:04:35.150> and<00:04:35.360> a<00:04:35.390> half<00:04:35.420> minutes

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
all right time at six and a half minutes

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:42.630 
all right time at six and a half minutes
around<00:04:36.050> time<00:04:36.440> now<00:04:36.650> and<00:04:37.540> okay<00:04:39.250> lost<00:04:40.250> scaring<00:04:40.940> so

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
around time now and okay lost scaring so

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.950 
around time now and okay lost scaring so
probably<00:04:43.640> out<00:04:43.790> of<00:04:43.820> juice<00:04:44.120> about<00:04:44.390> 20<00:04:44.690> minutes

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960
