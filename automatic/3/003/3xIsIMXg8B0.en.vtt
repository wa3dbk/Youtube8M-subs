without<00:01:34.439> any<00:01:34.680> eyeliner<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.400> Sevigny<00:01:36.090> already

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
without any eyeliner and Sevigny already

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.969 
without any eyeliner and Sevigny already
has<00:01:36.420> liquid<00:01:36.659> eyeliner<00:01:36.900> on<00:01:37.079> so<00:01:37.259> though<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.650> can

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
has liquid eyeliner on so though you can

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.100 
has liquid eyeliner on so though you can
kind<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.189> see<00:01:38.369> like<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.960> comparison<00:01:39.960> because

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
kind of see like a comparison because

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.230 
kind of see like a comparison because
typically<00:01:40.680> we<00:01:40.890> don't<00:01:41.130> go<00:01:41.790> without<00:01:42.030> liquid

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
typically we don't go without liquid

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.910 
typically we don't go without liquid
eyeliner<00:01:42.630> but<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:42.899> think<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.380> can<00:01:43.500> look<00:01:43.649> totally

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
eyeliner but I think it can look totally

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.039 
eyeliner but I think it can look totally
different<00:01:44.070> on<00:01:44.399> either<00:01:44.610> eye<00:01:44.939> so<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.750> gives<00:01:45.960> you

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
different on either eye so it gives you

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.289 
different on either eye so it gives you
it<00:01:46.259> yeah<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.799> gives<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.100> better<00:01:47.369> visual<00:01:48.119> of

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
it yeah it gives you a better visual of

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.819 
it yeah it gives you a better visual of
what<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.570> lashes<00:01:48.960> look<00:01:49.049> like<00:01:49.350> without<00:01:49.530> that

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
what the lashes look like without that

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.780 
what the lashes look like without that
eyeliner<00:01:50.159> behind<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:52.130> it's<00:01:53.130> funny<00:01:53.520> how<00:01:53.729> you

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
eyeliner behind it it's funny how you

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.149 
eyeliner behind it it's funny how you
can<00:01:53.909> almost<00:01:54.270> tell<00:01:54.689> like<00:01:54.930> immediately<00:01:55.409> if<00:01:56.100> you

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
can almost tell like immediately if you

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.090 
can almost tell like immediately if you
like<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.750> mascara<00:01:57.750> formulation<00:01:58.140> or<00:01:58.649> not<00:01:58.799> and

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
like a mascara formulation or not and

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:37.219 
because it kind of was able to get to

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:39.580 
because it kind of was able to get to
the<00:02:37.340> very<00:02:37.579> root<00:02:38.180> and<00:02:38.540> make<00:02:38.719> it<00:02:38.870> look<00:02:38.989> dark<00:02:39.319> and

covergirl formula I've ever used I

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:57.939 
covergirl formula I've ever used I
actually<00:02:57.079> thought<00:02:57.349> it<00:02:57.409> was<00:02:57.469> kind<00:02:57.560> of<00:02:57.709> drier

00:02:57.939 --> 00:02:57.949 
actually thought it was kind of drier

00:02:57.949 --> 00:03:01.330 
actually thought it was kind of drier
really<00:02:58.669> not<00:02:58.939> drier<00:02:59.239> than<00:02:59.480> normal<00:02:59.540> but<00:03:00.230> I'm<00:03:01.099> not

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
really not drier than normal but I'm not

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.879 
really not drier than normal but I'm not
mad<00:03:01.579> at<00:03:01.819> it<00:03:01.849> I<00:03:02.299> know<00:03:02.870> it's<00:03:03.109> not<00:03:03.260> it<00:03:03.500> doesn't<00:03:03.530> say

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:03.889 
mad at it I know it's not it doesn't say

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:05.349 
mad at it I know it's not it doesn't say
it's<00:03:04.069> super<00:03:04.370> lengthening<00:03:04.760> but<00:03:04.969> I<00:03:05.000> feel<00:03:05.269> like

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:05.359 
it's super lengthening but I feel like

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:07.509 
it's super lengthening but I feel like
it's<00:03:05.599> kind<00:03:06.169> of<00:03:06.260> giving<00:03:06.680> my<00:03:06.799> lashes<00:03:07.129> a<00:03:07.159> longer

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
it's kind of giving my lashes a longer

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.020 
it's kind of giving my lashes a longer
look<00:03:07.699> it's<00:03:08.150> definitely<00:03:08.629> defining<00:03:09.230> my<00:03:09.680> lashes

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
look it's definitely defining my lashes

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.379 
look it's definitely defining my lashes
cuz<00:03:11.030> my<00:03:11.959> lashes<00:03:12.199> are<00:03:12.500> like<00:03:12.650> defined<00:03:13.189> I<00:03:13.489> really

I<00:03:41.509> thought<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:42.229> formula<00:03:42.680> felt<00:03:42.889> a<00:03:42.949> little<00:03:43.040> wet

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
I thought the formula felt a little wet

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.429 
I thought the formula felt a little wet
but<00:03:43.519> the<00:03:43.699> brush<00:03:44.180> felt<00:03:44.540> a<00:03:44.659> little<00:03:44.750> bit<00:03:44.989> pointy

00:03:45.429 --> 00:03:45.439 
but the brush felt a little bit pointy

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:48.490 
but the brush felt a little bit pointy
and<00:03:45.650> sharp<00:03:45.739> and<00:03:46.310> not<00:03:46.790> drier<00:03:47.540> than<00:03:47.930> their<00:03:48.290> other

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
and sharp and not drier than their other

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.399 
and sharp and not drier than their other
ones<00:03:48.739> but<00:03:49.220> drier<00:03:49.669> like<00:03:50.150> Ben<00:03:50.840> knows<00:03:50.989> mascaras

and<00:04:25.060> this<00:04:25.510> one<00:04:25.720> which<00:04:25.960> would<00:04:26.200> be<00:04:26.260> I<00:04:26.830> think<00:04:27.160> I

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
and this one which would be I think I

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.710 
and this one which would be I think I
need<00:04:27.550> a<00:04:27.580> little<00:04:27.639> bit<00:04:27.790> of<00:04:27.850> time<00:04:28.120> with<00:04:28.330> this<00:04:28.480> one

need a little bit of time with this one
because<00:04:29.020> I<00:04:29.110> think<00:04:29.169> I<00:04:29.440> definitely<00:04:30.190> go<00:04:30.400> towards

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
because I think I definitely go towards

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.400 
because I think I definitely go towards
the<00:04:30.790> orange<00:04:31.030> tube<00:04:31.330> over<00:04:31.960> clump<00:04:32.169> pressure

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
the orange tube over clump pressure

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.220 
the orange tube over clump pressure
because<00:04:33.070> it's<00:04:33.250> like<00:04:33.460> og<00:04:33.910> and<00:04:34.180> I<00:04:34.810> feel<00:04:34.990> like<00:04:35.080> it

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
because it's like og and I feel like it

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.320 
because it's like og and I feel like it
kind<00:04:35.470> of<00:04:35.530> is<00:04:35.680> like<00:04:35.710> a<00:04:35.889> does<00:04:36.400> everything<00:04:36.790> but

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
kind of is like a does everything but

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.550 
kind of is like a does everything but
you<00:04:37.600> know<00:04:37.630> I<00:04:37.690> think<00:04:37.900> this<00:04:37.990> one<00:04:38.139> can<00:04:38.290> hold<00:04:38.410> its

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
you know I think this one can hold its

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.140 
you know I think this one can hold its
own<00:04:38.650> in<00:04:38.830> there<00:04:38.980> I<00:04:39.010> think<00:04:39.130> excited<00:04:40.030> we're

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
own in there I think excited we're

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.240 
own in there I think excited we're
defining<00:04:40.389> with<00:04:40.990> right<00:04:41.590> and<00:04:41.860> with<00:04:42.040> the

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
defining with right and with the

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.310 
defining with right and with the
original<00:04:43.000> lash<00:04:43.210> blast<00:04:43.479> I<00:04:43.630> do<00:04:43.720> feel<00:04:44.290> like

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
sometimes if I get too heavy-handed it

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.110 
sometimes if I get too heavy-handed it
can<00:04:47.050> start<00:04:47.410> to<00:04:47.530> want<00:04:47.860> to<00:04:47.979> group<00:04:48.190> up<00:04:48.400> yeah<00:04:48.850> and

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
can start to want to group up yeah and

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.330 
can start to want to group up yeah and
this<00:04:49.330> has<00:04:49.570> a<00:04:49.600> little<00:04:49.930> bit<00:04:50.229> like<00:04:50.800> she<00:04:50.979> said<00:04:51.160> more

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
this has a little bit like she said more

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.830 
this has a little bit like she said more
of<00:04:51.400> the<00:04:51.520> defining<00:04:51.850> so<00:04:52.150> I<00:04:52.180> think<00:04:52.479> that<00:04:52.660> would

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
of the defining so I think that would

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.659 
of the defining so I think that would
help<00:04:52.990> kind<00:04:53.320> of<00:04:53.440> prevent<00:04:54.040> that<00:04:54.160> but<00:04:54.370> with<00:04:54.460> clump

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
help kind of prevent that but with clump

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:55.980 
help kind of prevent that but with clump
