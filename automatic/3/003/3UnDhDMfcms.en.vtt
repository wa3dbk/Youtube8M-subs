basically<00:00:18.390> tightening<00:00:18.600> this<00:00:19.080> guy<00:00:19.289> well<00:00:19.500> it's

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
basically tightening this guy well it's

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.929 
basically tightening this guy well it's
spinning<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:20.070> putting<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.369> mighty<00:00:20.550> Bunning

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
so that's what I think it's reading all

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.109 
so that's what I think it's reading all
the<00:00:23.130> world<00:00:23.340> but<00:00:23.490> it's<00:00:23.640> playing<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.939> mighty
