00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:07.480
 and our friends on the table phone lenovo 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.639
 s930 is this cool six inch 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.130
 phone with a cool display with a good 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:14.469
 3000 milliamper battery 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.840
 cool such handsome screaming like 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:19.300
 crazy when I want to video 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.850
 show how to check if the phone will give 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.980
 buying the fact is that practically 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.310
 all lenovo phones in all sorts 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.200
 firmware already mounted special 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.420
 tools for checking all systems 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.910
 phone, that is, no need to download and 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.040
 install additional programs 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.590
 third-party all already have a phone for 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.380
 you just need to take the phone and 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:44.410
 call on number four lattice one 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:47.020
 extra grill 4 units well and last 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.420
 lattice we press and get here such 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.700
 here is such a menu here we can 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.550
 choose either full test or selective 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:57.600
 test but a report by the end of the test 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.440
 see the full test he will be in a circle 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.390
 offer all tests that is 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.870
 one after another one after another 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.790
 to others 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.370
 but we all have no sense in doing 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.590
 the video will stretch very long I will show 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.030
 how to do at least some tests 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.400
 have choose this item 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.860
 well and the main thing you need to check it 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.659
 the display that is it flooded with different 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.290
 colors you carefully look at 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.110
 pixels 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.330
 so that there are no bits, that is, if everything 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.340
 okay all good but you can repeat 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.260
 that is, you can 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.960
 repeat the same operation watch 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.610
 carefully not to miss anything 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.229
 deprived also makes sense to check 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:38.049
 touchscreen that is to make sure that it is so everywhere 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.690
 catches that is he has no zones i 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:42.610
 it doesn't work that sometimes it can be that 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.610
 let's say it seems to work too but let's say 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.460
 here it is a non-working zone 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:53.350
 here we are forced to go as if by 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:56.200
 all zones to make sure that all work here 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.600
 principle and all that is the same 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:03.060
 you can check the sound 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.060
 Anything let's see the sound 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:26.220
 this is only one speaker i am yelling 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:30.660
 God forbid well, test well, the test is successful 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.910
 That's basically all as would be necessary 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.860
 When buying everything, check if you are all 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.620
 check all the tests you will have successfully 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.480
 This means that the phone can be a good 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.820
 boldly buy it well that's all 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.830
 concerns checking the phone as follows 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.500
 video I'll show you how to reset all 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.320
 default phone settings 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.180
 it will be useful to do for example if 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.850
 b after installing some program 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.530
 either by itself the phone suddenly became 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.600
 somehow strange to work or not at all 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.450
 turns on don't rush it right away 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.130
 reflash usually in most 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.540
 cases it is enough to throw him all 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.760
 default settings 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.640
 and your phone will start and you will 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.870
 continue to delight in their excellent work 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.870
 in everything all bye
