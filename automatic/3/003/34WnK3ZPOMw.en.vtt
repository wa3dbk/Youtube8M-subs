00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.650
 to work effectively with 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.020
 vice we must respect the techniques or 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.030
 know the techniques with which 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.820
 they can perform the different tasks 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.640
 let's start then a drawing in 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.650
 white making a double click on drawing 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.230
 in white let's activate a new 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.770
 category of shapes we are going to choose this 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.500
 time flat maps and floor plans of 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.739
 construction furnishings of an office 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.600
 for example create the distribution 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.140
 of the furniture in a room 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.079
 conference within the category 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.660
 office furniture we choose a chair 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.480
 we press the drag to the drawing 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.519
 this chair is very small pressing 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:56.460
 control and uppercase changes the cursor 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:59.489
 I drag a free range in this way 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.999
 bring the sheet to the screen now 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:06.120
 I can move the chair with the button 

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:09.240
 top with the yellow button and I can 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.820
 start copying chairs with technique 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.060
 known to copy and paste 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.640
 sounding the control key and dragging 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.860
 the chair I see that the cursor has changed 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.770
 now there is a plus sign that tells me 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.700
 that will drag and copy we copy 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.700
 several chairs 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.780
 and the order of course is pretty 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.690
 uneven now I want to line these 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.800
 rows to line up I must mark all the 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:41.680
 chairs dragging a range with the mouse 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.980
 or pressing the control key 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.110
 to mark everything controls only I'm going to 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.330
 be able to use when you are sure that 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.400
 all the shapes of my drawing I want 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.860
 mark here we do not have more than this for 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.920
 that we can apply what is the first 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.840
 detail that we must recognize all 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.570
 drawings are marked 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:05.350
 in the same way except one that has 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:08.260
 a box in magenta over jumped the 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.869
 rest because this and not another form 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:13.930
 again control to the last one has been 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:17.200
 marked drag the mouse from another 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:20.770
 position has been marked another is to say the 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.680
 technique of marking everything in vice can 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.410
 be different in the case of dragging 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.319
 from the bottom up he has found 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.859
 the first one and it's 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:35.489
 has marked it as a point of reference and 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:38.430
 I press control and has marked the last 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:41.219
 that I copied as reference control 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.650
 this reference control drawing is going 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:45.659
 to be the one who is going to define me 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.750
 next is the task that you perform 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:51.299
 example align all the chairs let's go 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.849
 to the group organize within the tab 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:56.040
 start we choose position and if 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.379
 we drag the mouse over the 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.829
 different positions we will see the 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:04.169
 different effects equal in space 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:08.150
 distribute horizontally distribute 

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:11.120
 vertically and we already see what 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:15.230
 the new distribution of chairs are going to 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:18.890
 refer to the one that had the framework in 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:21.560
 magenta highlighted this which means that 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.680
 if I have a certain position where 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.530
 I want to accommodate all I move one of them 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.409
 and I start to mark each of the 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.930
 other chairs or I press the key now 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:36.319
 control and some rank over the rest of 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:39.650
 the chairs the first to mark will be the 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:43.900
 which is going to guide physio to distribute 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:46.790
 the position we repeat if we want to locate 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:50.540
 the alignment of all the drawings 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:54.709
 regarding one of these frame drawings 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:57.620
 this drawing pressed the control key and 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:00.430
 then he marked the rest of the drawings has 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.230
 my reference in magenta 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:06.850
 highlighted and now I can post the 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:09.310
 position that you consider most appropriate 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.770
 if we want to align the whole part 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.720
 inferior to always return as reaction 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.520
 to the lower part top is going to 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.650
 give the same results because the 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.650
 forms are the same once we have 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:24.070
 aligned all the figures we can 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:26.410
 change the space between the figures to 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.570
 at the same time these tasks can not be 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.510
 do vice you have to know first 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.940
 a provision for then power 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.920
 refer to the following position if 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.730
 I want to change the spaces 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.650
 between the drawings we go to position 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:44.410
 we enter space and we go to 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.710
 distribute horizontally or distribute 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:51.460
 vertically as he thinks so to speak of 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:54.040
 some way vice will take from the 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.590
 area marked the left end the 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:00.430
 extreme right and between these two 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:02.400
 positions will distribute the figures that 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.729
 are marked 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.770
 we then distribute horizontally and 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:10.590
 we see that now they have all the figures 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:13.650
 the same space between them this 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:16.169
 work within a group marked where 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.530
 All figures are the same is easy 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:22.440
 to recognize how it was done 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:24.740
 we enter in position we go to space 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.360
 we can find more options 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.699
 distribution where you should have in 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.759
 realize what I want to distribute 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:34.770
 between the two figures between the side 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:36.780
 right of the first figure and the 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.870
 right side of the second figure 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:42.840
 between the midpoint of each figure or 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:45.360
 between the left point of a figure and 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.639
 the other left point this is a 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.220
 technique that I can apply in drawings 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:53.190
 much more complicated where I need a 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:56.039
 very specific distribution in general 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:59.490
 the distribution of the objects are 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:06:02.540
 same or different sizes are going to 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:05.570
 be able to achieve it quickly 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:09.080
 first lining up the shapes once 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:11.540
 we have aligned the forms then we are going to 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:15.200
 align the space distributing the 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:17.750
 vertically or horizontally in this 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:21.320
 video we have seen how to distribute 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:23.870
 forms within a drawing taking into 

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:28.250
 account technical editing work 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:31.430
 The most important thing is to mark recognize 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:33.650
 what is the object what vice is going to take 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:36.200
 as guidance for the task of 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:38.630
 distribution in this case is the object 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:41.470
 that the box has the margin is more 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.470
 highlighted 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:46.240
 i
