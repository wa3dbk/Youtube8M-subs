00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
okay I'm going to show you how to remove

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.930 
okay I'm going to show you how to remove
the<00:00:09.389> color<00:00:09.570> cast<00:00:09.900> from<00:00:10.410> a<00:00:10.530> photo<00:00:10.830> this<00:00:11.670> is<00:00:11.820> a

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
the color cast from a photo this is a

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.430 
the color cast from a photo this is a
photo<00:00:12.710> slide<00:00:13.710> that<00:00:14.340> had<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.519> red<00:00:14.700> color<00:00:15.000> cast<00:00:15.440> so

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
photo slide that had a red color cast so

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.070 
photo slide that had a red color cast so
I'm<00:00:16.529> going<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:16.800> open<00:00:16.949> it<00:00:17.160> with<00:00:17.340> GIMP<00:00:18.080> the

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
I'm going to open it with GIMP the

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.519 
I'm going to open it with GIMP the
open-source<00:00:19.740> graphics<00:00:21.529> manipulation

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
open-source graphics manipulation

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.440 
open-source graphics manipulation
program

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:26.450 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.010 

I'm<00:00:27.170> running<00:00:27.440> 2.8<00:00:27.980> on<00:00:28.130> Linux<00:00:28.570> but<00:00:29.570> you<00:00:29.750> can<00:00:29.900> do

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:30.020 
I'm running 2.8 on Linux but you can do

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.100 
I'm running 2.8 on Linux but you can do
the<00:00:30.140> same<00:00:30.350> thing<00:00:30.560> in<00:00:30.680> Windows<00:00:31.010> and<00:00:31.870> all<00:00:32.870> the

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
the same thing in Windows and all the

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.660 
the same thing in Windows and all the
versions<00:00:33.290> of<00:00:33.620> chemical<00:00:34.010> work<00:00:34.190> pretty<00:00:34.460> much

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
versions of chemical work pretty much

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.260 
versions of chemical work pretty much
the<00:00:34.910> same<00:00:35.090> now<00:00:35.840> this<00:00:35.989> file<00:00:36.850> from<00:00:37.850> the<00:00:37.970> scan<00:00:38.239> I

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
the same now this file from the scan I

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.780 
the same now this file from the scan I
had<00:00:38.630> a<00:00:38.660> certain<00:00:39.080> color<00:00:39.290> profile<00:00:40.600> but<00:00:42.430> and<00:00:43.430> so

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
had a certain color profile but and so

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.689 
had a certain color profile but and so
normally<00:00:44.030> we<00:00:44.480> want<00:00:44.660> to<00:00:44.720> work<00:00:44.900> in<00:00:45.110> a<00:00:45.699> RGB

00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:46.699 
normally we want to work in a RGB

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:48.640 
normally we want to work in a RGB
working<00:00:46.879> space<00:00:47.090> so<00:00:47.690> I'll<00:00:47.900> just<00:00:48.050> do<00:00:48.260> convert

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
working space so I'll just do convert

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.210 
working space so I'll just do convert
and<00:00:49.489> we<00:00:49.580> can<00:00:49.730> see<00:00:49.850> there's<00:00:50.000> a<00:00:50.030> red<00:00:50.210> color<00:00:50.449> cast

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220 
and we can see there's a red color cast

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.390 
and we can see there's a red color cast
so<00:00:52.220> obviously<00:00:53.059> we<00:00:53.269> want<00:00:53.300> to<00:00:53.629> reduce<00:00:54.290> the<00:00:54.710> cars

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:55.400 
so obviously we want to reduce the cars

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.280 
so obviously we want to reduce the cars
the<00:00:55.580> other<00:00:55.610> thing<00:00:55.940> is<00:00:56.090> is<00:00:56.269> that<00:00:56.480> you<00:00:56.720> can<00:00:56.900> tell

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
the other thing is is that you can tell

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.640 
the other thing is is that you can tell
that<00:00:57.530> this<00:00:57.710> sort<00:00:58.010> of<00:00:58.070> a<00:00:58.129> fairly<00:00:59.170> one<00:01:00.170> two<00:01:00.409> color

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:00.650 
that this sort of a fairly one two color

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.140 
that this sort of a fairly one two color
range<00:01:00.890> now<00:01:01.220> if<00:01:01.339> we<00:01:01.430> bring<00:01:01.550> up<00:01:01.670> the<00:01:01.760> colors

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:02.150 
range now if we bring up the colors

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.680 
range now if we bring up the colors
levels<00:01:03.110> you<00:01:04.010> can<00:01:04.159> see<00:01:04.400> that'll<00:01:04.729> all<00:01:05.210> of<00:01:05.510> the

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
levels you can see that'll all of the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.980 
levels you can see that'll all of the
signal<00:01:06.560> level<00:01:06.799> is<00:01:06.890> in<00:01:07.040> this<00:01:07.159> upper<00:01:07.430> area<00:01:07.990> now

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
signal level is in this upper area now

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.250 
signal level is in this upper area now
we<00:01:09.620> could<00:01:09.860> adjust<00:01:10.220> just<00:01:10.610> the<00:01:11.479> brightness<00:01:12.049> here

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
we could adjust just the brightness here

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.990 
we could adjust just the brightness here
but<00:01:12.560> it<00:01:12.680> doesn't<00:01:12.860> really<00:01:13.159> do<00:01:13.400> anything<00:01:13.670> for<00:01:13.940> us

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
but it doesn't really do anything for us

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.430 
but it doesn't really do anything for us
we<00:01:14.180> still<00:01:14.390> have<00:01:14.540> a<00:01:14.570> red<00:01:14.810> forecast<00:01:15.200> because

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
we still have a red forecast because

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
we still have a red forecast because
adjusting<00:01:16.220> all<00:01:16.430> all<00:01:17.299> things<00:01:17.690> equally<00:01:18.409> what<00:01:19.340> we

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
adjusting all all things equally what we

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.850 
adjusting all all things equally what we
really<00:01:19.850> want<00:01:20.030> to<00:01:20.090> be<00:01:20.240> doing<00:01:20.270> is<00:01:20.900> one<00:01:21.619> of<00:01:21.740> the

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
really want to be doing is one of the

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.670 
really want to be doing is one of the
time<00:01:22.100> we<00:01:22.580> can<00:01:22.790> adjust<00:01:23.000> the<00:01:23.540> color<00:01:23.570> now<00:01:24.020> this

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
time we can adjust the color now this

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.430 
time we can adjust the color now this
top<00:01:25.040> area<00:01:25.460> is<00:01:25.670> the<00:01:26.180> input<00:01:26.630> level<00:01:26.960> so<00:01:27.170> what's

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
top area is the input level so what's

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.310 
top area is the input level so what's
seen<00:01:27.770> in<00:01:28.460> each<00:01:28.729> of<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.150> color<00:01:29.659> so<00:01:29.900> you<00:01:29.990> can<00:01:30.049> see

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
seen in each of the color so you can see

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.999 
seen in each of the color so you can see
if<00:01:30.409> I<00:01:30.530> go<00:01:30.560> that<00:01:30.890> red<00:01:31.100> green<00:01:31.280> blue<00:01:32.560> we<00:01:33.560> had

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
if I go that red green blue we had

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:35.950 
if I go that red green blue we had
different<00:01:34.340> ranges<00:01:34.880> of<00:01:34.969> colors<00:01:35.329> from<00:01:35.630> the

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
different ranges of colors from the

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.230 
different ranges of colors from the
darkest<00:01:36.500> of<00:01:36.799> the<00:01:37.100> Reds<00:01:37.399> to<00:01:37.700> the<00:01:37.789> brightest<00:01:38.210> and

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
darkest of the Reds to the brightest and

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.779 
darkest of the Reds to the brightest and
of<00:01:38.420> course<00:01:38.630> in<00:01:39.380> that<00:01:39.560> channel<00:01:40.130> their<00:01:40.369> output

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:40.789 
of course in that channel their output

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:44.469 
of course in that channel their output
from<00:01:41.000> the<00:01:41.180> black<00:01:41.509> to<00:01:41.750> the<00:01:41.960> full<00:01:42.170> red<00:01:42.399> so<00:01:43.479> to

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
from the black to the full red so to

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.590 
from the black to the full red so to
make<00:01:44.689> the<00:01:44.929> best<00:01:45.140> use<00:01:45.259> of<00:01:45.469> available<00:01:46.600> guess

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
make the best use of available guess

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.889 
make the best use of available guess
coloring<00:01:48.049> as<00:01:48.200> we<00:01:48.320> have<00:01:48.530> we<00:01:49.369> actually<00:01:50.119> prefer

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
coloring as we have we actually prefer

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.950 
coloring as we have we actually prefer
to<00:01:51.200> spread<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:52.490> color<00:01:53.299> over<00:01:53.719> the<00:01:53.810> full

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
to spread the color over the full

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.940 
to spread the color over the full
spectrum<00:01:54.289> where<00:01:55.280> I'm<00:01:55.399> going

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
spectrum where I'm going

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.100 
spectrum where I'm going
you<00:01:56.399> can<00:01:56.549> see<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:56.820> I've<00:01:56.939> moved<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.390> up<00:01:57.450> from

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
you can see that I've moved that up from

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.480 
you can see that I've moved that up from
the<00:01:58.200> darkest<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.829> light<00:01:59.039> and<00:01:59.280> then<00:01:59.399> I

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
the darkest to the light and then I

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.770 
the darkest to the light and then I
could<00:01:59.640> just<00:01:59.670> move<00:02:00.000> this<00:02:00.090> around<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.509> little<00:02:00.600> bit

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
could just move this around a little bit

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.719 
could just move this around a little bit
to<00:02:00.960> where<00:02:01.079> I<00:02:01.140> think<00:02:01.289> it<00:02:01.560> should<00:02:01.770> be<00:02:01.829> now<00:02:02.219> we're

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
to where I think it should be now we're

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.090 
to where I think it should be now we're
not<00:02:02.820> making<00:02:03.630> anything<00:02:03.810> permanent<00:02:03.930> yet<00:02:04.469> but

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
not making anything permanent yet but

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.380 
not making anything permanent yet but
you<00:02:05.189> can<00:02:05.310> see<00:02:05.460> already<00:02:05.640> there's<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.060> huge

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
you can see already there's a huge

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.559 
you can see already there's a huge
improvement<00:02:06.780> there<00:02:07.200> so<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:08.789> know<00:02:08.879> moving

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
improvement there so you know moving

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:15.180 
improvement there so you know moving
from<00:02:09.869> where<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.259> was<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.910> just<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.690> something

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
from where it was to just to something

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.640 
from where it was to just to something
do<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:15.850> same<00:02:16.030> with<00:02:16.270> the<00:02:16.360> green<00:02:16.390> so<00:02:17.050> again<00:02:17.350> what

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
do the same with the green so again what

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.710 
do the same with the green so again what
we're<00:02:17.800> trying<00:02:17.980> to<00:02:18.160> do<00:02:18.280> is<00:02:18.430> we<00:02:18.670> actually<00:02:18.720> doing

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
we're trying to do is we actually doing

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.590 
we're trying to do is we actually doing
two<00:02:19.870> things<00:02:19.900> we're<00:02:20.290> expanding<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:21.450> ranges<00:02:22.450> of

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
two things we're expanding the ranges of

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.600 
two things we're expanding the ranges of
colors<00:02:22.900> that<00:02:22.930> are<00:02:23.290> available<00:02:23.800> in<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.400> image

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
colors that are available in the image

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.090 
colors that are available in the image
and<00:02:25.000> then<00:02:25.240> also<00:02:25.660> just<00:02:26.080> adjusting<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.710> shoes<00:02:27.070> a

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
and then also just adjusting the shoes a

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:33.030 
and then also just adjusting the shoes a
bit<00:02:28.200> blue<00:02:29.200> do<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.070> same<00:02:30.280> thing<00:02:31.410> now<00:02:32.410> obviously

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
bit blue do the same thing now obviously

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.300 
bit blue do the same thing now obviously
this<00:02:33.250> is<00:02:33.460> assuming<00:02:33.760> a<00:02:34.500> pretty<00:02:35.500> much<00:02:35.710> constant

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
this is assuming a pretty much constant

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.540 
this is assuming a pretty much constant
color<00:02:36.580> cast<00:02:36.930> it's<00:02:37.930> really<00:02:38.440> real<00:02:38.650> got<00:02:39.280> what<00:02:39.520> I

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
color cast it's really real got what I

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:45.450 
color cast it's really real got what I
wanted<00:02:40.030> be<00:02:40.360> honest<00:02:42.690> picture<00:02:43.710> it<00:02:44.710> looks<00:02:45.130> pretty

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
wanted be honest picture it looks pretty

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.480 
wanted be honest picture it looks pretty
good<00:02:45.760> now<00:02:46.470> you<00:02:47.470> know<00:02:47.590> you<00:02:47.650> can<00:02:47.920> still<00:02:48.280> see<00:02:48.460> a

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
good now you know you can still see a

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.140 
good now you know you can still see a
lot<00:02:48.700> of<00:02:48.760> red<00:02:49.000> in<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.300> background<00:02:49.990> of<00:02:50.830> the

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
lot of red in the background of the

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.200 
lot of red in the background of the
foliage<00:02:52.150> here<00:02:52.390> so<00:02:53.170> if<00:02:53.500> I<00:02:53.620> just<00:02:53.910> just<00:02:54.910> just

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.210 
foliage here so if I just just just

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.600 
foliage here so if I just just just
changed<00:02:56.200> out<00:02:56.320> a<00:02:56.350> little<00:02:56.560> bit<00:02:56.770> you<00:02:57.250> can<00:02:57.370> see

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
changed out a little bit you can see

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.380 
changed out a little bit you can see
that<00:02:57.820> I'm<00:02:58.420> actually<00:02:59.220> moving<00:03:00.220> a<00:03:00.670> bit<00:03:01.120> bit<00:03:01.360> of

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
that I'm actually moving a bit bit of

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.720 
that I'm actually moving a bit bit of
bit<00:03:01.660> less<00:03:01.870> red

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
bit less red

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.809 
bit less red
and<00:03:04.060> of<00:03:04.120> course<00:03:04.330> it's<00:03:04.840> actually<00:03:05.580> coming<00:03:06.580> away

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
and of course it's actually coming away

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.100 
and of course it's actually coming away
and<00:03:07.030> I<00:03:07.060> see<00:03:07.390> well<00:03:08.260> expect<00:03:08.709> with<00:03:08.920> the<00:03:09.069> white<00:03:10.110> the

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
and I see well expect with the white the

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.820 
and I see well expect with the white the
white<00:03:12.870> clothing<00:03:13.870> and<00:03:14.230> etc<00:03:14.769> it's<00:03:15.610> pretty<00:03:15.849> close

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
white clothing and etc it's pretty close

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.500 
white clothing and etc it's pretty close
anyway<00:03:17.830> that's<00:03:18.190> pretty<00:03:18.340> much<00:03:18.760> what<00:03:19.239> all<00:03:19.480> I

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
anyway that's pretty much what all I

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.940 
anyway that's pretty much what all I
wanted<00:03:19.780> for<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:19.989> show<00:03:21.599> here<00:03:22.650> now<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:23.769> only

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
wanted for the show here now the only

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.460 
wanted for the show here now the only
other<00:03:24.040> thing<00:03:24.340> we<00:03:24.370> can<00:03:24.670> do<00:03:24.870> is<00:03:25.870> we<00:03:26.050> can<00:03:26.170> save

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
other thing we can do is we can save

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.160 
other thing we can do is we can save
settings<00:03:27.090> so<00:03:28.680> we<00:03:29.680> can<00:03:29.799> just<00:03:29.950> say<00:03:30.099> removed<00:03:31.170> read

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
settings so we can just say removed read

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.150 
settings so we can just say removed read
cast<00:03:33.420> instance<00:03:34.470> so<00:03:35.470> then<00:03:35.620> we<00:03:35.709> can<00:03:35.860> come<00:03:36.040> back

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
cast instance so then we can come back

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.490 
cast instance so then we can come back
and<00:03:36.220> we<00:03:36.430> can<00:03:36.580> actually<00:03:37.080> once<00:03:38.080> we've<00:03:38.290> done<00:03:38.440> that

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
and we can actually once we've done that

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.039 
and we can actually once we've done that
we<00:03:38.709> can<00:03:38.890> use<00:03:39.099> that<00:03:39.310> so<00:03:39.519> in<00:03:39.640> fact<00:03:39.849> what<00:03:40.569> I<00:03:40.599> can<00:03:40.870> do

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
we can use that so in fact what I can do

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:45.000 
we can use that so in fact what I can do
is<00:03:41.260> I<00:03:42.000> can<00:03:43.000> show<00:03:43.360> you<00:03:43.420> applying<00:03:44.079> the<00:03:44.680> current

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
is I can show you applying the current

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.000 
is I can show you applying the current
settings<00:03:45.340> if<00:03:45.459> I<00:03:45.549> undo<00:03:45.970> what<00:03:46.299> we've<00:03:46.450> just<00:03:46.480> done

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
settings if I undo what we've just done

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.410 
settings if I undo what we've just done
all<00:03:48.010> right<00:03:48.130> back<00:03:48.549> to<00:03:48.730> the<00:03:48.849> original<00:03:49.209> cars

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
all right back to the original cars

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.630 
all right back to the original cars
going<00:03:49.900> to<00:03:50.019> colors<00:03:50.380> purples<00:03:51.250> and<00:03:51.310> if<00:03:51.430> we<00:03:51.549> were

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
going to colors purples and if we were

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.780 
going to colors purples and if we were
bringing<00:03:51.970> in<00:03:52.239> another<00:03:52.420> photo<00:03:52.750> that<00:03:53.230> was<00:03:53.380> a

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
bringing in another photo that was a

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.860 
bringing in another photo that was a
similar<00:03:54.790> image<00:03:55.060> we<00:03:55.209> can<00:03:55.329> just<00:03:55.510> find<00:03:55.690> our

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
similar image we can just find our

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.339 
similar image we can just find our
preset<00:03:56.410> and<00:03:57.400> then<00:03:57.610> apply<00:03:57.910> it<00:03:57.970> and<00:03:58.660> we're<00:03:58.930> done

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
preset and then apply it and we're done

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.620 
preset and then apply it and we're done
and<00:03:59.950> then<00:04:00.160> we<00:04:00.340> just<00:04:00.519> export<00:04:01.090> it

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
and then we just export it

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.320 
and then we just export it
and<00:04:02.750> obviously<00:04:03.580> you<00:04:04.580> know<00:04:04.730> I<00:04:04.970> want<00:04:05.270> to

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
and obviously you know I want to

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.840 
and obviously you know I want to
preserve<00:04:05.920> image<00:04:06.920> then<00:04:07.370> I<00:04:07.550> just<00:04:08.350> just<00:04:09.430> fixed<00:04:10.430> on

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
preserve image then I just just fixed on

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.050 
preserve image then I just just fixed on
there<00:04:11.150> so<00:04:11.720> the<00:04:11.840> original<00:04:12.260> ones<00:04:12.380> still<00:04:12.560> there

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
there so the original ones still there

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:19.930 
there so the original ones still there
and<00:04:14.060> export<00:04:15.280> and<00:04:16.750> voila<00:04:18.430> so<00:04:19.430> we<00:04:19.520> have<00:04:19.640> two

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
and export and voila so we have two

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.120 
and export and voila so we have two
versions
