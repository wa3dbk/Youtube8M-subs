you know and that's what's going on and

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.789 
you know and that's what's going on and
also<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.890> do<00:01:47.850> try<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.210> get<00:01:48.720> my<00:01:48.840> videos<00:01:49.110> sorted

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.980 
also I do try and get my videos sorted
but<00:01:50.550> it<00:01:50.700> may<00:01:50.850> be<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.030> while<00:01:51.240> between<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.720> blades

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
but it may be a while between the blades

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.160 
but it may be a while between the blades
because<00:01:52.880> it's<00:01:53.880> getting<00:01:54.360> time<00:01:54.690> to<00:01:54.960> film

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
because it's getting time to film
