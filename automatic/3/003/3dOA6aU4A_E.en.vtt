yet some of the things that I do want to
talk<00:02:22.159> about<00:02:22.219> though<00:02:22.519> guys<00:02:22.670> is<00:02:22.939> there's<00:02:23.420> a

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
talk about though guys is there's a

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.119 
talk about though guys is there's a
couple<00:02:23.780> other<00:02:23.900> ways<00:02:24.170> you<00:02:24.200> can<00:02:24.469> spec<00:02:24.739> right<00:02:24.950> now

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129 
couple other ways you can spec right now

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:27.490 
couple other ways you can spec right now
with<00:02:25.459> marshman<00:02:25.969> chip<00:02:26.180> and<00:02:26.359> it<00:02:27.019> can<00:02:27.170> be<00:02:27.230> just<00:02:27.409> as

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
with marshman chip and it can be just as

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.080 
with marshman chip and it can be just as
effective<00:02:27.680> as<00:02:28.099> the<00:02:28.129> way<00:02:28.310> that<00:02:28.489> I<00:02:28.519> described<00:02:28.969> in

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
effective as the way that I described in

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.539 
effective as the way that I described in
my<00:02:29.120> last<00:02:29.329> video<00:02:29.510> but<00:02:29.950> what<00:02:30.950> you<00:02:31.099> can<00:02:31.250> do<00:02:31.370> is<00:02:31.489> you

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
my last video but what you can do is you

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.399 
my last video but what you can do is you
can<00:02:31.609> actually<00:02:31.700> remove<00:02:32.239> one<00:02:32.750> to<00:02:32.870> two<00:02:33.019> points<00:02:33.319> in

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:33.409 
can actually remove one to two points in

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:35.199 
can actually remove one to two points in
passing<00:02:33.859> or<00:02:34.040> I<00:02:34.489> don't<00:02:34.609> think<00:02:34.760> you<00:02:34.909> can<00:02:35.000> remove

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
passing or I don't think you can remove

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.929 
passing or I don't think you can remove
all<00:02:35.389> three<00:02:35.599> but<00:02:36.349> for<00:02:36.709> some<00:02:36.980> gear<00:02:37.280> builds<00:02:37.730> for

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:37.939 
all three but for some gear builds for

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:39.670 
all three but for some gear builds for
people<00:02:38.239> that<00:02:38.359> have<00:02:38.389> higher<00:02:38.840> ends<00:02:39.200> at<00:02:39.349> the<00:02:39.379> year

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
people that have higher ends at the year

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.899 
people that have higher ends at the year
and<00:02:39.799> even<00:02:39.889> for<00:02:40.129> some<00:02:40.310> that<00:02:40.430> might<00:02:40.579> have<00:02:40.730> lower

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:40.909 
and even for some that might have lower

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:43.179 
and even for some that might have lower
sets<00:02:41.209> of<00:02:41.329> gear<00:02:41.510> you<00:02:42.469> can<00:02:42.620> remove<00:02:42.799> appointed

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:43.189 
sets of gear you can remove appointed

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:45.490 
sets of gear you can remove appointed
pathing<00:02:43.609> and<00:02:43.790> it<00:02:44.510> allows<00:02:44.719> you<00:02:44.840> to<00:02:44.930> put<00:02:45.139> extra

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
pathing and it allows you to put extra

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.559 
pathing and it allows you to put extra
one<00:02:46.069> to<00:02:46.189> two<00:02:46.340> points<00:02:46.790> or<00:02:47.000> either<00:02:47.180> an<00:02:47.359> extra

point frenzy or bc of discipline and

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.209 
point frenzy or bc of discipline and
this<00:02:50.780> does<00:02:50.989> it<00:02:51.169> allows<00:02:51.230> you<00:02:51.560> to<00:02:51.739> keep<00:02:52.010> more

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:52.219 
this does it allows you to keep more

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:54.670 
this does it allows you to keep more

I've<00:03:01.669> been<00:03:01.909> doing<00:03:02.090> a<00:03:02.150> lot<00:03:02.239> of<00:03:02.299> testing<00:03:02.780> on

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
I've been doing a lot of testing on

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.170 
I've been doing a lot of testing on
female<00:03:03.290> dwarf<00:03:03.439> with<00:03:03.739> my<00:03:03.889> settings<00:03:04.340> and<00:03:04.609> really

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
female dwarf with my settings and really

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.030 
female dwarf with my settings and really
playing<00:03:05.419> around<00:03:05.599> with<00:03:05.719> the<00:03:05.840> reforging<00:03:06.349> and<00:03:06.949> I

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
playing around with the reforging and I

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.500 
playing around with the reforging and I
have<00:03:07.189> yet<00:03:07.400> to<00:03:07.430> get<00:03:07.609> it<00:03:07.730> to<00:03:07.819> work<00:03:07.939> for<00:03:08.180> me<00:03:08.299> to<00:03:08.419> be

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
have yet to get it to work for me to be

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.089 
have yet to get it to work for me to be
an<00:03:08.599> increase<00:03:08.989> I<00:03:09.230> mean<00:03:09.439> they're<00:03:09.590> fairly<00:03:09.769> close

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099

an obviously i'm priy like putting down
an<00:03:45.290> explosive<00:03:45.769> trap<00:03:45.979> before<00:03:46.189> the<00:03:47.150> stack<00:03:47.659> up

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
an explosive trap before the stack up

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.899 
an explosive trap before the stack up
just<00:03:48.049> because<00:03:48.169> it's<00:03:48.859> very<00:03:49.040> beneficial<00:03:49.220> but

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:49.909 
just because it's very beneficial but

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:51.729 
just because it's very beneficial but
normally<00:03:50.449> you<00:03:50.509> won't<00:03:50.720> be<00:03:50.810> able<00:03:50.900> to<00:03:51.109> a<00:03:51.409> wee<00:03:51.590> them

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
normally you won't be able to a wee them

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.830 
normally you won't be able to a wee them
too<00:03:51.889> much<00:03:52.069> and<00:03:52.310> this<00:03:53.060> was<00:03:53.209> just<00:03:53.389> with<00:03:53.509> a<00:03:53.540> bug

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
too much and this was just with a bug

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.629 
too much and this was just with a bug
anyway<00:03:54.199> so<00:03:54.259> maybe<00:03:54.769> here<00:03:55.069> with<00:03:55.310> your<00:03:55.430> guilt

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:55.639 
anyway so maybe here with your guilt

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:57.819 
anyway so maybe here with your guilt
it's<00:03:55.790> not<00:03:56.060> even<00:03:56.299> a<00:03:56.359> problem<00:03:56.719> but<00:03:56.930> obviously

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
it's not even a problem but obviously

00:03:57.829 --> 00:03:59.319 
it's not even a problem but obviously
the<00:03:57.979> dead<00:03:58.159> zone<00:03:58.189> with<00:03:58.489> hunters<00:03:58.819> does<00:03:59.000> make<00:03:59.209> it

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
the dead zone with hunters does make it

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:02.679 
the dead zone with hunters does make it
a<00:03:59.389> little<00:03:59.419> bit<00:03:59.750> difficult<00:04:00.790> but<00:04:01.790> I<00:04:02.060> think

00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:02.689 
a little bit difficult but I think

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:04.089 
a little bit difficult but I think
that's<00:04:02.870> about<00:04:03.199> all<00:04:03.319> the<00:04:03.560> main<00:04:03.709> stuff<00:04:03.739> they

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099 
that's about all the main stuff they

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:05.679 
that's about all the main stuff they
wanted<00:04:04.280> to<00:04:04.340> cover<00:04:04.549> but<00:04:05.150> yeah<00:04:05.239> I'm<00:04:05.419> going<00:04:05.569> to<00:04:05.629> be
