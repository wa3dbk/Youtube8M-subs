for life this video I discuss receding
gums<00:00:22.430> now<00:00:23.430> you<00:00:24.119> can<00:00:24.300> have<00:00:24.570> various<00:00:25.019> reasons

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
gums now you can have various reasons

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.849 
gums now you can have various reasons
for<00:00:25.500> receiving<00:00:25.830> gums<00:00:26.930> in<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.289> younger

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
for receiving gums in the younger

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.820 
for receiving gums in the younger
generation<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.820> may<00:00:30.449> need<00:00:30.660> you<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.109> possibly

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
generation it may need you to possibly

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.580 
generation it may need you to possibly
owe<00:00:32.040> three<00:00:32.390> enthusiastic<00:00:33.390> brushing<00:00:33.870> which<00:00:34.440> is

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
owe three enthusiastic brushing which is

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.370 
owe three enthusiastic brushing which is
literally<00:00:34.980> wearing<00:00:35.520> away<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:36.059> surface<00:00:36.510> so

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
literally wearing away the surface so

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.459 
literally wearing away the surface so
that<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.829> gum<00:00:38.010> wears<00:00:38.250> away<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:39.260> exposes<00:00:40.260> more

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
that the gum wears away and exposes more

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.299 
that the gum wears away and exposes more
of<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.649> root<00:00:42.440> this<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.620> slightly<00:00:44.040> complicated

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
of the root this is slightly complicated

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.970 
of the root this is slightly complicated
by<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.030> fact<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:45.690> depends<00:00:46.289> on<00:00:46.410> where<00:00:46.860> the

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
by the fact that it depends on where the

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.560 
by the fact that it depends on where the
tooth<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.370> actually<00:00:47.700> positioned<00:00:48.149> in<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.360> jaw

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
tooth is actually positioned in the jaw

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.049 
tooth is actually positioned in the jaw
bone<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.160> sometimes<00:00:50.160> there<00:00:50.550> just<00:00:50.579> isn't<00:00:51.030> very

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
bone and sometimes there just isn't very

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.900 
bone and sometimes there just isn't very
much<00:00:51.420> bone<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:52.320> surround<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.190> two<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.610> start

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
much bone to surround the two to start

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.970 
much bone to surround the two to start
with<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.989> quickly<00:00:55.410> made<00:00:55.559> your<00:00:55.739> shrink

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
with and it quickly made your shrink

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.209 
with and it quickly made your shrink
back<00:00:56.190> this<00:00:57.149> is<00:00:57.360> not<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.660> disease<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.530> it's<00:00:58.980> not

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
back this is not a disease and it's not

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.430 
back this is not a disease and it's not
likely<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.640> cause<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.270> loss<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.870> tooth

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
likely to cause the loss of a tooth

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.310 
likely to cause the loss of a tooth
it<00:01:01.949> may<00:01:02.250> be<00:01:02.309> unsightly<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.660> may<00:01:03.809> need<00:01:04.199> to

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
it may be unsightly and you may need to

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.109 
it may be unsightly and you may need to
talk<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.619> your<00:01:04.739> dentist<00:01:05.070> about<00:01:05.220> how<00:01:05.549> possibly

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
talk to your dentist about how possibly

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.420 
talk to your dentist about how possibly
you<00:01:06.240> could<00:01:06.390> cause<00:01:06.540> metal<00:01:06.840> help<00:01:07.170> but<00:01:08.130> this<00:01:08.310> is

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
you could cause metal help but this is

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.490 
you could cause metal help but this is
not<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.729> disease<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.930> next<00:01:10.560> possible

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
not a disease the next possible

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.440 
not a disease the next possible
situation<00:01:13.500> where<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.979> may<00:01:14.159> notice<00:01:14.850> receding

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
situation where you may notice receding

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.590 
situation where you may notice receding
gums<00:01:15.659> is<00:01:15.930> actually<00:01:16.350> just<00:01:16.590> purely<00:01:16.860> aging<00:01:17.600> but

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
gums is actually just purely aging but

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.320 
gums is actually just purely aging but
as<00:01:18.750> we<00:01:18.960> get<00:01:19.080> older<00:01:19.220> the<00:01:20.220> gum<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.909> jaw<00:01:21.090> bone

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
as we get older the gum and the jaw bone

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.090 
as we get older the gum and the jaw bone
does<00:01:21.600> shrink<00:01:21.990> back<00:01:22.200> from<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.650> roots<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:23.009> the

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
does shrink back from the roots of the

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.240 
does shrink back from the roots of the
teeth<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.689> so<00:01:24.689> this<00:01:24.990> again<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.680> natural

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
teeth and so this again is a natural

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.149 
teeth and so this again is a natural
process<00:01:26.490> but<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.689> often<00:01:28.049> find<00:01:28.259> my<00:01:28.590> patients<00:01:29.040> do

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
process but I often find my patients do

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.069 
process but I often find my patients do
get<00:01:29.340> slightly<00:01:29.790> alarmed<00:01:30.240> when<00:01:30.450> they<00:01:30.600> see<00:01:30.659> that

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
get slightly alarmed when they see that

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.530 
get slightly alarmed when they see that
their<00:01:31.350> their<00:01:32.159> roots<00:01:32.369> are<00:01:32.579> more<00:01:32.759> exposed<00:01:33.150> and

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
their their roots are more exposed and

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.850 
their their roots are more exposed and
again<00:01:33.869> possibly<00:01:34.350> unsightly<00:01:35.630> now<00:01:36.630> by<00:01:37.409> trying

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
again possibly unsightly now by trying

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.580 
again possibly unsightly now by trying
to<00:01:38.159> brush<00:01:38.909> them<00:01:39.329> you<00:01:39.659> can't<00:01:39.990> sort<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.320> brush

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
to brush them you can't sort of brush

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.980 
to brush them you can't sort of brush
them<00:01:40.829> back<00:01:41.100> once<00:01:41.729> you've<00:01:42.030> actually<00:01:42.210> these

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
them back once you've actually these

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.929 
them back once you've actually these
gums<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.409> shrunk<00:01:43.710> bag<00:01:43.950> or<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.579> could<00:01:44.759> really

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
gums of shrunk bag or you could really

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.039 
gums of shrunk bag or you could really
do<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.270> keep<00:01:45.479> them<00:01:45.689> healthy<00:01:46.140> by<00:01:46.710> good<00:01:47.520> hygiene

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
do is keep them healthy by good hygiene

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.950 
do is keep them healthy by good hygiene
around<00:01:49.049> where<00:01:49.619> they<00:01:49.740> join<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.130> tooth<00:01:50.960> trying

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
around where they join the tooth trying

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.230 
around where they join the tooth trying
to<00:01:52.020> comb<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.439> gums<00:01:52.649> back<00:01:52.950> will<00:01:53.430> only<00:01:53.610> lead<00:01:53.939> to

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
to comb the gums back will only lead to

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.120 
to comb the gums back will only lead to
some<00:01:54.780> pockets<00:01:55.200> building<00:01:55.560> up<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:55.890> possibly

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
some pockets building up and possibly

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.910 
some pockets building up and possibly
gum<00:01:56.579> disease

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
gum disease

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.859 
gum disease
now<00:01:58.920> gum<00:01:59.189> disease<00:01:59.520> is<00:01:59.850> often<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.270> most<00:02:00.360> common

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
now gum disease is often the most common

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.370 
now gum disease is often the most common
cause<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.439> receding<00:02:02.159> gums<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:03.020> this<00:02:04.020> is<00:02:04.200> where

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
cause of receding gums and this is where

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.490 
cause of receding gums and this is where
the<00:02:04.860> bacteria<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:06.030> plaque<00:02:06.630> have<00:02:06.960> actually

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
the bacteria and plaque have actually

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.040 
the bacteria and plaque have actually
caused<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.129> bone<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.610> shrink

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
caused the bone to shrink

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.840 
caused the bone to shrink
back<00:02:09.190> because<00:02:10.190> of<00:02:10.310> disease<00:02:10.640> and<00:02:11.680> this<00:02:12.850> is

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
back because of disease and this is

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.990 
back because of disease and this is
