00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
conventions of the preview I guess of

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.680 
conventions of the preview I guess of
the<00:00:51.390> figure<00:00:51.829> this<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:53.129> nothing<00:00:53.789> like<00:00:53.969> what<00:00:54.390> was

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
shown in at the cons and this is a just

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.529 
shown in at the cons and this is a just
really<00:00:59.699> poor<00:00:59.969> quality<00:01:00.620> paint<00:01:01.620> job<00:01:02.129> on<00:01:02.670> this

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539

I used throk adrene and I just did it

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.479

it
it's<00:03:18.180> barely<00:03:18.420> even<00:03:18.570> noticeable<00:03:19.260> and<00:03:19.680> I'm<00:03:20.549> not

sure<00:03:20.820> if<00:03:20.940> I<00:03:21.030> even<00:03:21.209> needed<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:21.690> do<00:03:21.870> it<00:03:22.049> but<00:03:22.320> I<00:03:22.380> did

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
sure if I even needed to do it but I did

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.729 
sure if I even needed to do it but I did
it<00:03:22.799> anyways<00:03:23.190> and<00:03:23.810> after<00:03:24.810> that<00:03:25.019> dried<00:03:25.410> I

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
it anyways and after that dried I

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:34.910 
it anyways and after that dried I
applied<00:03:26.580> a<00:03:28.820> green<00:03:30.320> dark<00:03:31.320> green<00:03:32.810> dry<00:03:33.810> brush<00:03:34.200> for

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
applied a green dark green dry brush for

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.220 
applied a green dark green dry brush for
the<00:03:35.040> highlights<00:03:35.459> in<00:03:35.670> the<00:03:35.760> hair<00:03:36.000> and<00:03:36.570> I<00:03:36.930> used

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
the highlights in the hair and I used

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.420 
the highlights in the hair and I used
dark<00:03:37.799> angels<00:03:38.430> green<00:03:38.760> on<00:03:39.170> there<00:03:40.170> and<00:03:40.680> then

dark angels green on there and then
after<00:03:41.940> that<00:03:42.269> dried<00:03:42.750> it<00:03:43.049> applied<00:03:43.380> another

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.850 

dry<00:03:46.920> brush<00:03:47.220> on<00:03:47.700> the<00:03:48.090> on<00:03:48.360> the<00:03:48.540> hair<00:03:48.750> and<00:03:49.200> using<00:03:49.709> a

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
dry brush on the on the hair and using a

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.880 
dry brush on the on the hair and using a
lighter<00:03:50.160> green<00:03:50.549> and<00:03:51.019> using<00:03:52.019> goblin<00:03:52.709> green

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
lighter green and using goblin green

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.259 
lighter green and using goblin green
hair<00:03:53.280> and<00:03:53.900> I<00:03:55.280> think<00:03:56.280> I<00:03:56.549> did<00:03:56.730> a<00:03:56.760> pretty<00:03:56.820> good<00:03:57.209> job

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
hair and I think I did a pretty good job

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.289 
hair and I think I did a pretty good job
on<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:58.290> hair<00:03:58.530> I<00:03:58.799> think<00:03:59.160> I<00:03:59.519> maybe<00:03:59.850> have<00:04:00.269> a

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
on the hair I think I maybe have a

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.420 
on the hair I think I maybe have a
little<00:04:00.630> bit<00:04:00.810> too<00:04:01.110> much<00:04:01.290> green<00:04:01.620> in<00:04:01.650> here<00:04:02.100> and

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
little bit too much green in here and

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.660 
little bit too much green in here and
that's<00:04:03.209> easily<00:04:03.570> fixable<00:04:04.230> by<00:04:04.530> just<00:04:04.830> taking<00:04:05.370> the

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
that's easily fixable by just taking the

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.449 
that's easily fixable by just taking the
black<00:04:05.940> ink<00:04:06.239> wash<00:04:06.600> a<00:04:07.049> bad<00:04:07.590> at<00:04:07.799> black<00:04:08.130> and

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
black ink wash a bad at black and

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.940 
black ink wash a bad at black and
applied<00:04:09.239> it<00:04:09.510> in<00:04:09.660> certain<00:04:10.049> areas<00:04:10.350> into<00:04:10.739> the

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
applied it in certain areas into the

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.159 
applied it in certain areas into the
recesses<00:04:11.420> so<00:04:12.420> it'll<00:04:13.260> thin<00:04:13.980> out<00:04:14.130> the<00:04:14.340> green<00:04:14.609> and

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:15.169 
recesses so it'll thin out the green and

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:18.300 
recesses so it'll thin out the green and
make<00:04:16.169> the<00:04:16.410> highlighted<00:04:16.980> green<00:04:17.010> Stan

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
make the highlighted green Stan

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.879 
make the highlighted green Stan
I<00:04:18.340> may<00:04:19.329> do<00:04:19.509> that<00:04:19.889> in<00:04:20.889> a<00:04:21.009> little<00:04:21.280> bit<00:04:21.459> so<00:04:22.139> now<00:04:23.139> for

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
I may do that in a little bit so now for

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:27.080 
I may do that in a little bit so now for
the<00:04:24.100> face<00:04:24.370> I<00:04:25.020> did<00:04:26.020> a<00:04:26.050> little<00:04:26.440> bit<00:04:26.650> of

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
the face I did a little bit of

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.610 
the face I did a little bit of
modifications<00:04:28.090> I<00:04:28.270> I'm<00:04:28.630> not<00:04:28.900> sure<00:04:29.289> if<00:04:29.410> you<00:04:29.500> can

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
modifications I I'm not sure if you can

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.089 
modifications I I'm not sure if you can
actually<00:04:29.680> see<00:04:30.039> it<00:04:30.370> but<00:04:30.610> the<00:04:31.150> people's<00:04:31.569> on

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:32.099 
actually see it but the people's on

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:35.580 
actually see it but the people's on
black<00:04:33.099> widows<00:04:33.400> eyes<00:04:33.610> had<00:04:33.910> been<00:04:34.030> painted<00:04:34.449> green

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
black widows eyes had been painted green

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:41.820 
black widows eyes had been painted green
I<00:04:35.819> used<00:04:36.960> see<00:04:37.960> here<00:04:38.530> goblin<00:04:39.400> green<00:04:39.699> and<00:04:40.830> I

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
I used see here goblin green and I

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.020 
I used see here goblin green and I
didn't<00:04:42.340> use<00:04:42.610> any<00:04:43.210> of<00:04:43.330> my<00:04:43.449> brushes<00:04:43.870> here<00:04:45.030> right

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
didn't use any of my brushes here right

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.120 
didn't use any of my brushes here right
here<00:04:46.389> because<00:04:46.780> I<00:04:46.810> think<00:04:47.319> it<00:04:47.620> would<00:04:47.800> have<00:04:47.949> been

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
here because I think it would have been

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:53.339 
here because I think it would have been
too<00:04:48.610> thick<00:04:48.910> even<00:04:49.180> my<00:04:50.759> brush<00:04:51.759> here<00:04:52.240> the<00:04:52.509> fine

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:53.349 
too thick even my brush here the fine

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:54.450 
too thick even my brush here the fine
detail<00:04:53.830> brush

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
detail brush

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.189 
detail brush
I<00:04:54.490> think<00:04:55.360> this<00:04:55.900> even<00:04:56.860> though<00:04:56.949> it's<00:04:57.099> very<00:04:57.190> thin

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 
I think this even though it's very thin

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:01.890 
I think this even though it's very thin
I<00:04:59.199> think<00:04:59.889> it<00:05:00.009> would<00:05:00.220> have<00:05:00.310> been<00:05:00.490> too<00:05:00.759> thick<00:05:01.120> for

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
I think it would have been too thick for

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:08.430 
I think it would have been too thick for
the<00:05:01.990> eyes<00:05:02.139> and<00:05:02.169> I<00:05:03.009> used<00:05:03.970> a<00:05:04.479> tip<00:05:06.030> from<00:05:07.380> trying<00:05:08.380> to

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
the eyes and I used a tip from trying to

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.499 
the eyes and I used a tip from trying to
remember<00:05:08.889> is<00:05:09.039> it<00:05:09.159> six<00:05:09.400> guy<00:05:09.669> one<00:05:09.970> I<00:05:10.000> can't

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:10.509 
remember is it six guy one I can't

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:11.899 
remember is it six guy one I can't
remember<00:05:10.750> I'll<00:05:10.990> have<00:05:11.169> to<00:05:11.320> put<00:05:11.530> in<00:05:11.710> the

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:11.909 
remember I'll have to put in the

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:16.080 
remember I'll have to put in the
annotations<00:05:12.909> but<00:05:13.570> he<00:05:13.750> had<00:05:14.460> advised<00:05:15.460> using<00:05:16.000> a

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
annotations but he had advised using a

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:21.420

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
but I didn't have one so I just had this

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.659 
but I didn't have one so I just had this
twisty<00:05:28.240> tie<00:05:28.479> here<00:05:28.900> from<00:05:29.830> the<00:05:30.190> grocery<00:05:30.580> store

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:34.200 
twisty tie here from the grocery store
and<00:05:31.150> I<00:05:31.990> stripped<00:05:32.380> it<00:05:32.530> and<00:05:32.560> it's<00:05:33.280> got<00:05:33.580> the<00:05:33.759> small

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210

and I stripped it and it's got the small
thin<00:05:34.810> wire<00:05:35.409> and<00:05:36.250> I<00:05:36.880> just<00:05:37.090> used<00:05:37.360> that<00:05:37.509> and

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
thin wire and I just used that and

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.379 
thin wire and I just used that and
dipped<00:05:38.259> it<00:05:38.380> in<00:05:38.530> goblin<00:05:39.009> green<00:05:39.280> and<00:05:39.699> very

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:40.389 
dipped it in goblin green and very

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:44.279 
dipped it in goblin green and very
carefully<00:05:41.699> applied<00:05:42.699> it<00:05:42.909> on<00:05:43.000> the<00:05:43.719> pupil<00:05:43.960> and

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:44.289 
carefully applied it on the pupil and

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:46.770 
carefully applied it on the pupil and
that<00:05:44.530> this<00:05:44.860> saw<00:05:44.979> works<00:05:45.310> pretty<00:05:45.639> good<00:05:45.909> on<00:05:46.509> there

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
that this saw works pretty good on there

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.140 
that this saw works pretty good on there
or<00:05:46.960> use<00:05:47.320> it<00:05:47.560> but<00:05:47.770> like<00:05:47.949> I<00:05:48.039> said<00:05:48.099> the<00:05:48.580> cocktail

toothpick<00:05:50.020> and<00:05:50.229> that'll<00:05:50.530> you<00:05:51.340> can<00:05:51.490> get<00:05:51.699> the

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
toothpick and that'll you can get the

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.920 
toothpick and that'll you can get the
pupils<00:05:52.750> on<00:05:52.900> the<00:05:52.990> eyes<00:05:53.139> done<00:05:53.979> very<00:05:54.250> well<00:05:54.310> and

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
pupils on the eyes done very well and

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.779 
pupils on the eyes done very well and
for<00:05:55.930> the<00:05:56.110> lips<00:05:56.320> I<00:05:56.770> painted<00:05:57.340> over<00:05:57.490> that<00:05:57.729> it

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:57.789 
for the lips I painted over that it

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:01.950 
for the lips I painted over that it
wasn't<00:05:58.050> originally<00:05:59.050> red<00:05:59.289> and<00:05:59.530> just<00:05:59.680> used<00:06:00.960> dark

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
wasn't originally red and just used dark

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.839 
wasn't originally red and just used dark
angel<00:06:02.229> green<00:06:02.680> or<00:06:03.130> a<00:06:03.430> darker<00:06:03.820> green<00:06:04.090> on<00:06:04.599> there

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:05.849 
angel green or a darker green on there

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:09.270 
angel green or a darker green on there
overall<00:06:06.849> I<00:06:06.880> think<00:06:07.030> it<00:06:07.300> did<00:06:07.840> okay

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280 
overall I think it did okay

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.689 
overall I think it did okay
did<00:06:10.030> a<00:06:10.060> pretty<00:06:10.330> good<00:06:10.599> job<00:06:11.280> let<00:06:12.280> me<00:06:12.400> know<00:06:12.520> what

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:12.699 
did a pretty good job let me know what

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:16.170 
did a pretty good job let me know what
you<00:06:12.820> think<00:06:13.139> I<00:06:14.139> prefer<00:06:14.830> this<00:06:15.039> head<00:06:15.310> much<00:06:15.849> better

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:16.180 
you think I prefer this head much better

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.409 
you think I prefer this head much better
than<00:06:16.870> the<00:06:17.020> head<00:06:17.199> that<00:06:17.380> we<00:06:17.469> were<00:06:17.620> given<00:06:17.979> on<00:06:18.419> here

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:19.419 
than the head that we were given on here

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:21.420 
than the head that we were given on here
although<00:06:20.050> this<00:06:20.349> head<00:06:20.620> is<00:06:20.740> a<00:06:20.770> little<00:06:21.009> bit

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:21.430 
although this head is a little bit

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:24.020 
although this head is a little bit
little<00:06:21.880> bit<00:06:22.000> bigger<00:06:22.389> but<00:06:22.719> I<00:06:22.750> think<00:06:22.990> it<00:06:23.080> was<00:06:23.259> a

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.030 
little bit bigger but I think it was a

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.740 
little bit bigger but I think it was a
the<00:06:25.030> base<00:06:25.240> for<00:06:25.930> both<00:06:26.080> Madame<00:06:26.740> masque<00:06:26.979> and

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:27.750 
the base for both Madame masque and

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.430 
the base for both Madame masque and
Madame<00:06:28.750> Hydra<00:06:29.020> although<00:06:29.469> Madame<00:06:29.770> masque<00:06:29.979> has

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 
Madame Hydra although Madame masque has

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.130 
Madame Hydra although Madame masque has
different<00:06:30.740> sculpted<00:06:31.340> face<00:06:31.940> although<00:06:32.600> I<00:06:32.750> think

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:33.140 
different sculpted face although I think

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.610 
different sculpted face although I think
the<00:06:33.230> head<00:06:33.440> overall<00:06:33.920> was<00:06:34.130> the<00:06:34.280> shared<00:06:35.240> on<00:06:36.170> there

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:36.620 
the head overall was the shared on there

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.950 
the head overall was the shared on there
but<00:06:36.920> I<00:06:37.400> think<00:06:38.150> it's<00:06:38.480> a<00:06:38.630> lot<00:06:39.500> better<00:06:39.890> I<00:06:40.850> may<00:06:41.480> just

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:41.960 
but I think it's a lot better I may just

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.980 
but I think it's a lot better I may just
get<00:06:42.080> some<00:06:42.290> acetone<00:06:43.160> and<00:06:43.630> see<00:06:44.630> if<00:06:44.720> I<00:06:44.810> can

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:44.990 
get some acetone and see if I can

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:46.960 
get some acetone and see if I can
repaint<00:06:45.440> this<00:06:46.010> head<00:06:46.280> and<00:06:46.520> maybe<00:06:46.670> it<00:06:46.820> might

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:46.970 
repaint this head and maybe it might

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.330 
repaint this head and maybe it might
turn<00:06:47.180> out<00:06:47.210> better<00:06:47.570> especially<00:06:48.500> the<00:06:48.860> lips<00:06:49.100> oh

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:49.340 
turn out better especially the lips oh

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.250 
turn out better especially the lips oh
this<00:06:49.520> is<00:06:49.670> terrible<00:06:50.180> job<00:06:50.450> on<00:06:50.630> the<00:06:50.750> lips<00:06:50.960> on<00:06:51.140> this
