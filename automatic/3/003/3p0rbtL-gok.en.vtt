sometimes<00:00:04.920> you<00:00:05.040> want<00:00:05.250> to<00:00:05.339> generate

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
sometimes you want to generate

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.759 
sometimes you want to generate
renderings<00:00:06.600> based<00:00:06.930> off<00:00:07.140> of<00:00:07.170> the<00:00:07.350> scenes<00:00:07.680> that

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:07.769 
renderings based off of the scenes that

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:09.890 
renderings based off of the scenes that
you've<00:00:07.950> created<00:00:08.340> in<00:00:08.670> this<00:00:09.120> instance<00:00:09.750> I've

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
you've created in this instance I've

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.499

placed<00:00:10.440> in<00:00:10.590> books<00:00:10.889> pictures<00:00:11.850> and<00:00:12.179> then

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
placed in books pictures and then

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.930 
placed in books pictures and then
seating<00:00:13.080> into<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.620> scene<00:00:13.920> by<00:00:14.460> coming

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
seating into the scene by coming

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.330 
seating into the scene by coming
underneath<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.360> objects<00:00:16.040> selecting<00:00:17.040> some<00:00:17.189> of

my<00:00:17.460> interior<00:00:17.910> scene<00:00:18.360> objects<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.410> then

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
my interior scene objects and then

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.810 
my interior scene objects and then
placing<00:00:19.980> them<00:00:20.099> in<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.279> appropriate

photo over screen and after that we're
going<00:00:37.589> to<00:00:37.679> generate<00:00:38.039> a<00:00:38.280> rendering<00:00:38.820> based<00:00:39.210> off

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
going to generate a rendering based off

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.540 
going to generate a rendering based off
of<00:00:39.539> that<00:00:39.690> photo<00:00:40.109> come<00:00:40.440> up<00:00:41.129> here<00:00:41.280> toward<00:00:41.489> the

camera<00:00:44.039> that<00:00:44.280> drops<00:00:44.579> down<00:00:44.699> here<00:00:45.239> once<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:45.629> get

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
camera that drops down here once you get

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.509 
camera that drops down here once you get
close<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.230> one<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.469> these<00:00:46.589> boxes<00:00:47.039> going<00:00:47.309> across

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:47.519 
close to one of these boxes going across

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:50.450 
close to one of these boxes going across
the<00:00:47.789> top<00:00:48.050> by<00:00:49.050> doing<00:00:49.469> this<00:00:49.620> it'll<00:00:49.980> now<00:00:50.159> take<00:00:50.429> a

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
the top by doing this it'll now take a

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.630 
the top by doing this it'll now take a
photo<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:51.300> how<00:00:51.659> the<00:00:51.719> seam<00:00:52.170> looks<00:00:52.409> and<00:00:52.800> now<00:00:53.579> we

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
photo of how the seam looks and now we

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.759 
photo of how the seam looks and now we
can<00:00:53.940> generate<00:00:54.329> an<00:00:54.480> image<00:00:54.659> down<00:00:55.319> here<00:00:55.350> at<00:00:55.649> the

00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:55.769 
can generate an image down here at the

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:58.040 
can generate an image down here at the
bottom<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.280> screen<00:00:56.629> now<00:00:57.629> there's<00:00:57.809> four

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
bottom of the screen now there's four

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.779 
bottom of the screen now there's four
different<00:00:58.079> sizes<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:58.890> can<00:00:58.980> do<00:00:59.309> the

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
different sizes that you can do the

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.969 
different sizes that you can do the
email<00:01:00.179> image<00:01:00.569> is<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.809> smallest<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.620> they<00:01:01.829> get

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:01.979 
email image is the smallest and they get

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:04.280 
email image is the smallest and they get
progressively<00:01:02.159> bigger<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.479> poster<00:01:03.899> size<00:01:04.110> is

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
progressively bigger the poster size is

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.440 
progressively bigger the poster size is
gonna<00:01:04.470> take<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.949> longest<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.940> it'll<00:01:06.150> be<00:01:06.300> the

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
gonna take the longest and it'll be the

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.530 
gonna take the longest and it'll be the
best<00:01:06.690> quality<00:01:07.290> as<00:01:07.440> well<00:01:07.620> as<00:01:07.800> the<00:01:07.950> largest

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
best quality as well as the largest

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.750 
best quality as well as the largest
email<00:01:09.540> size<00:01:09.870> is<00:01:10.200> gonna<00:01:10.470> be<00:01:10.620> the<00:01:10.740> smallest<00:01:11.160> but

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
email size is gonna be the smallest but

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.670 
email size is gonna be the smallest but
it<00:01:11.850> will<00:01:12.000> be<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.360> fastest<00:01:12.870> to<00:01:12.900> do<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.170> rendering

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
it will be the fastest to do a rendering

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.740 
it will be the fastest to do a rendering
for<00:01:13.980> in<00:01:14.190> this<00:01:14.730> case<00:01:14.970> that's<00:01:15.210> what<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.450> want<00:01:15.660> to

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
over the scene in order to generate the

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.550 
over the scene in order to generate the
appropriate<00:01:49.030> conditions<00:01:50.030> after<00:01:50.350> doing<00:01:51.350> this

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
appropriate conditions after doing this

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.020 
appropriate conditions after doing this
it<00:01:51.980> doesn't<00:01:52.160> look<00:01:52.310> like<00:01:52.400> much<00:01:52.700> has<00:01:52.760> happened

it doesn't look like much has happened

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.200 
it doesn't look like much has happened
but<00:01:53.480> it<00:01:53.600> has<00:01:53.870> generated<00:01:54.740> that<00:01:54.890> image<00:01:55.340> now<00:01:56.150> to

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
but it has generated that image now to
