00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.510
 ae 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.330
 was created the students here the teacher 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:53.940
 joselias we will solve the doubt of a 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.610
 student our student sent the following 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.120
 doubt of a military police contest 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:04.100
 de São Paulo in 2011 by vunesp 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.930
 see her doubt a candy store 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:11.210
 bought some chocolate tablets 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:17.430
 white and other milk chocolate 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:21.060
 a total of 144 tablets 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:25.619
 if the ratio between the chocolate stable 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.110
 white chocolate and milk chocolate 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.560
 order is from 2 to 7 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:38.119
 then the number of chocolate tablet 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:48.690
 the milk bought was and let's the solution 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:55.619
 the solution and says that reason is the reason 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:02:00.929
 between Establet and white chocolate 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:02.009
 Milk chocolate in that order was 2 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:05.789
 to 7 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:11.090
 then I wrote the ratio 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:11.090
 amount of white chocolate then 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.980
 White chocolate 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:37.110
 milk chocolate milk chocolate 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:38.840
 this ratio is from 2 to 7 is the ratio of 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:48.080
 2 to 7 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:48.080
 he says that in total in total we have 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.050
 144 tablets 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:01.370
 he wants to know the amount of tablets 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.370
 milk chocolate 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.019
 looking at the data initially a reason 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.360
 between the amount of white chocolate and 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:12.239
 of milk chocolate at the ratio of 2 to 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.370
 7 as the seventh greater than two nodes 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:19.349
 we know there's more milk chocolate 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:23.209
 of the white chocolate kit and in total 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:23.209
 15 and 44 tablets 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:32.540
 let's imagine that you have 144 tablets 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:35.850
 and you're going to put those tablets in boxes 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:39.090
 in always the same amount will do 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:42.750
 several boxes with tablets 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.150
 this 144 tablet not divided into boxes 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.319
 with the same amount of tablets in 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.350
 each box 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.940
 in this case this division could be 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.870
 made abi 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:57.959
 according to this reason where I would have two 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:01.680
 boxes with chocolate to bank to white 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:05.370
 and seven boxes with milk chocolate 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:10.260
 in total he would have nine boxes in total 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:14.430
 I would have nine boxes divided and 144 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:19.919
 tablet in nine cases other tablets eu 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:27.210
 would have in each box won split 144 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:28.620
 tablet in nine boxes then 144/9 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.320
 I would have 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:40.120
 sixteen tablets in each carton 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:45.150
 I would have 16 tablets in each box 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.150
 hey each in each box 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:54.580
 then he would have nine boxes each with 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:58.270
 16 white chocolate tablets 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:04.330
 I would have two boxes of chocolate then 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:07.060
 white and I would have two boxes each 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:10.240
 with 16 tablets 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:15.910
 then it would be two boxes with 16 tablets 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:18.810
 in each one I would have 32 tablets of 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:22.000
 white white chocolate 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.840
 ide the law says that was the question and 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.410
 milk 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:30.460
 I would then have seven boxes to milk to 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:35.890
 milk 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:40.750
 we would have seven boxes each with 16 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:50.860
 then we would obtain tablets seven times and 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:55.500
 16 112 tablets 112 tablets of 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:06:05.110
 chocolate milk chocolate milk 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:07.660
 milk chocolate 112 tablets 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:11.790
 his question was the amount of 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:14.560
 milk chocolate tablets 112 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:17.170
 you see that the 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:20.950
 alternative of the letter b of ball 

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:26.070
 the letter b of ball in the doubt of our 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:29.310
 colleague letter b ball 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:34.180
 this is a solution for a reasoning 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:36.830
 all questions of reason can be 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:39.170
 solved in this way 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:41.060
 then the reasoning that shows a lot 

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:43.190
 content of my courses in the courses 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.880
 online you learn how to do this 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.150
 way 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:49.250
 beauty and well being to those who have doubts

 Good luck and see you next time. 

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:09.160
