of<00:02:03.299> this<00:02:03.869> record<00:02:04.110> leaves<00:02:04.530> some<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:04.950> these

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
little too hard on the vocals to kind of

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.490 
little too hard on the vocals to kind of
carry<00:03:26.490> the<00:03:26.670> song<00:03:26.940> and<00:03:27.270> the<00:03:27.540> vocals<00:03:27.930> just<00:03:28.290> don't

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
carry the song and the vocals just don't

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.190 
carry the song and the vocals just don't
have<00:03:28.800> the<00:03:29.190> personality<00:03:29.760> or<00:03:30.240> the<00:03:30.390> presence<00:03:30.900> to

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
have the personality or the presence to

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.130 
have the personality or the presence to
lead<00:03:32.070> these<00:03:32.460> songs<00:03:32.820> in<00:03:33.240> the<00:03:33.330> way<00:03:33.450> that<00:03:33.720> I<00:03:33.930> feel

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
lead these songs in the way that I feel

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.870 
lead these songs in the way that I feel
like<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.410> band<00:03:34.590> is<00:03:34.710> pushing<00:03:35.160> them<00:03:35.310> to<00:03:35.520> either

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
like the band is pushing them to either

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.330 
like the band is pushing them to either
they're<00:03:36.360> too<00:03:36.390> heavily<00:03:36.900> warped<00:03:37.530> in<00:03:37.680> effects<00:03:38.190> to

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
they're too heavily warped in effects to

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.520 
they're too heavily warped in effects to
even<00:03:38.610> really<00:03:38.850> be<00:03:39.090> memorable<00:03:39.420> or<00:03:39.810> when<00:03:40.380> they're

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
even really be memorable or when they're

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.800 
even really be memorable or when they're
raw<00:03:40.800> and<00:03:41.190> really<00:03:41.670> dry<00:03:41.970> they<00:03:42.180> just<00:03:42.360> feel<00:03:42.480> too

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
raw and really dry they just feel too

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.320 
raw and really dry they just feel too
lightweight<00:03:43.440> to<00:03:43.800> really<00:03:44.040> leave<00:03:44.280> an<00:03:44.640> impact<00:03:45.150> I

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
lightweight to really leave an impact I

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.880 
lightweight to really leave an impact I
think<00:03:45.360> the<00:03:45.600> only<00:03:45.780> vocal<00:03:46.290> on<00:03:46.380> here<00:03:46.560> that<00:03:46.590> works

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
think the only vocal on here that works

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.460 
think the only vocal on here that works
against<00:03:47.370> that<00:03:47.520> is<00:03:47.880> the<00:03:48.510> one<00:03:48.750> that<00:03:48.930> opens<00:03:49.290> up

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
against that is the one that opens up

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.990 
against that is the one that opens up
the<00:03:49.590> final<00:03:49.830> track<00:03:50.220> on<00:03:50.430> this<00:03:50.550> record<00:03:50.880> which

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
the final track on this record which

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.990 
the final track on this record which
feels<00:03:51.240> pretty<00:03:51.540> weary<00:03:52.470> and<00:03:52.800> sort<00:03:53.340> of<00:03:53.430> menacing

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
feels pretty weary and sort of menacing

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.270

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
my opinion of this LP is good I just

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.930 
my opinion of this LP is good I just
focus<00:04:22.049> on<00:04:22.200> these<00:04:22.530> few<00:04:23.160> things<00:04:23.460> that<00:04:23.640> I<00:04:23.669> think

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
focus on these few things that I think

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.820 
focus on these few things that I think
take<00:04:24.180> this<00:04:24.330> record<00:04:24.570> down<00:04:24.870> a<00:04:24.930> bit<00:04:25.260> because<00:04:25.650> I

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
take this record down a bit because I

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.360 
take this record down a bit because I
think<00:04:25.950> this<00:04:26.190> is<00:04:26.370> really<00:04:26.520> a<00:04:26.640> band<00:04:26.910> away

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
think this is really a band away

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.500 
think this is really a band away
and<00:04:27.520> I<00:04:27.550> think<00:04:27.729> they<00:04:27.820> have<00:04:27.940> an<00:04:28.030> incredible

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
and I think they have an incredible

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.110 
and I think they have an incredible
amount<00:04:28.750> of<00:04:28.919> potential<00:04:29.919> I<00:04:30.310> just<00:04:30.699> feel<00:04:30.850> like<00:04:30.940> the

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
amount of potential I just feel like the

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.790 
amount of potential I just feel like the
vocals<00:04:31.479> could<00:04:31.720> be<00:04:31.840> cleaned<00:04:32.410> up

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
vocals could be cleaned up

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.740 
vocals could be cleaned up
turned<00:04:33.220> up<00:04:33.639> maybe<00:04:33.940> delivered<00:04:34.389> with<00:04:34.540> a<00:04:34.570> bit

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
turned up maybe delivered with a bit

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.930 
turned up maybe delivered with a bit
more<00:04:34.930> passion<00:04:35.650> or<00:04:35.830> emotion<00:04:36.340> and<00:04:36.520> the

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
more passion or emotion and the

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.640 
more passion or emotion and the
production<00:04:37.389> could<00:04:37.600> be<00:04:37.660> a<00:04:37.780> bit<00:04:37.990> clearer<00:04:38.410> as

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
production could be a bit clearer as

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.680 
production could be a bit clearer as
well<00:04:38.889> overall<00:04:39.550> I'm<00:04:39.669> feeling<00:04:39.699> a<00:04:40.000> strong<00:04:40.270> six<00:04:40.570> to
