00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.580
 only boys are all very well 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.260
 I'm the fake and the 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.980
 video of today we will talk a little 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.830
 more about good trolley regulation 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.380
 today she is talking about distress 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:29.789
 distress is a device that regulates the 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:34.110
 the spool pressure with it allows 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.460
 that the reel is releasing the line with 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.500
 the desired pressure 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.469
 if you work with your function too much 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.980
 loose what can happen 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.539
 the fish can pauleira if you have 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:49.770
 fishing and a place where there is a lot of 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:52.739
 osol structure may loosen when 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.300
 too much bamboo can happen or else 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.230
 the bait 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:01.859
 if it's too caught up it can happen and 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:06.180
 numerous things h atheistic or hook may 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:09.570
 opening the spinner may break the line or 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:16.170
 knot and the legs of hypotheses 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:20.220
 stick with the pressure here she breaks or 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:23.850
 then the spool shaft importing 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.220
 correct regulation of this function 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.750
 would be in which way with the help of a 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.869
 balance 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.640
 then you would wrap your garat or hook 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.950
 the reel we're talking like 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.670
 serves both to monetize and to 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:43.710
 also reel and then you weigh 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:46.380
 balance is required there 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.890
 this necessary regulation they say that 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.210
 is about a quarter of the 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.990
 line resistance 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:59.490
 well I do not have balances then the shape 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:03.869
 that regulates which is how I just 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:07.950
 here is a certain affliction that the star is 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:12.060
 I see pull that is too loose grip 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:15.530
 A little bit is still very loose 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.530
 so I'm using it from there 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:25.640
 What happens, you have to have a 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.410
 certain pressure in the regulation here so that 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.480
 there is a certain resistance 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.340
 This is also what influences the 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.840
 Weight size if fish fishing 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.650
 You know fish only have fish. 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.900
 small 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.340
 for example a pond you can 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.520
 working with the more open function if 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.260
 Are you fishing in a river that you know? 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.220
 that can happen to find fish 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.290
 larger 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:57.360
 you can push a little bit then O 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:03:00.510
 You're going to dosing is not going to be too tight. 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.500
 then what happens along with the action 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:10.620
 of this wand 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:12.480
 I can not let the stick force 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.290
 a lot of 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.050
 so I came here one dosing 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:23.610
 certain limit of the action of the rod 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:27.660
 this affliction only has to be released 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:33.959
 Let's assume fish caught you going regular. 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:35.660
 is not releasing this earthquake is very 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:40.800
 tight 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:45.480
 so that's why he says that 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:48.000
 set has to be balanced you 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:52.560
 use a line that is consistent with the 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.640
 numbering of your rod because in the worst case 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.560
 hypotheses 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.050
 I'd rather lose a fish than 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.510
 burst the stuff of this then I too 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:05.790
 I make this swing here stick 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:08.850
 the right stick action uses you 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.780
 using a line that is consistent with the 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:14.310
 numbered here in the information 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.850
 understand then I needed you have to 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:21.090
 take a swing has to use the good 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:24.510
 sense you use an eco-sea one 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.970
 very light rod for a very long line 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.389
 thick to understand what happens not there 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.020
 it is 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:34.349
 now and the stick that will then break through 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:37.490
 This is a personal saying that we use a 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:42.539
 balanced equipment understood 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:43.889
 reel line and rod balanced one 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:46.860
 balanced set 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:48.990
 understood the staff hope you guys 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.979
 Did you like this video? 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.020
 staying here 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:54.090
 if you are not already subscribed to the channel if 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:59.159
 sign up for updates 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:02.039
 of my videos and staying here I 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:04.520
 I'll go back to my fishing there 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:06.689
 I'm fishing, I'm recording for you there. 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.919
 although there it is good today 

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:09.919
 It's okay, guys.
