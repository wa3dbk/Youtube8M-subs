00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
you a little bit and then make a small

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.480 
you a little bit and then make a small
oval<00:04:01.440> kind<00:04:02.440> of<00:04:02.560> you're<00:04:02.710> pushing<00:04:03.100> the<00:04:03.160> striker

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.490 
oval kind of you're pushing the striker

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.340 
oval kind of you're pushing the striker
in<00:04:03.820> the<00:04:04.150> direction<00:04:04.450> that<00:04:04.720> it's<00:04:04.930> pointing

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
in the direction that it's pointing

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.800 
in the direction that it's pointing
okays<00:04:05.680> up<00:04:06.010> then<00:04:06.490> you<00:04:06.550> point<00:04:06.730> away<00:04:06.880> now<00:04:07.600> then

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
okays up then you point away now then

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.240 
okays up then you point away now then
it's<00:04:07.960> pointing<00:04:08.290> this<00:04:08.380> way<00:04:08.440> so<00:04:08.620> you're<00:04:09.160> going

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
it's pointing this way so you're going

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.360 
it's pointing this way so you're going
to<00:04:09.310> drag<00:04:09.700> it<00:04:09.750> down<00:04:10.750> and<00:04:11.170> then<00:04:11.620> and<00:04:11.860> I<00:04:12.100> never

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
to drag it down and then and I never

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.580 
to drag it down and then and I never
take<00:04:12.640> this<00:04:12.820> the<00:04:13.209> striker<00:04:13.630> off<00:04:13.930> of<00:04:14.290> the<00:04:14.410> surface

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
take this the striker off of the surface

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.229 
take this the striker off of the surface
of<00:04:14.920> the<00:04:15.070> slate<00:04:15.310> I've<00:04:15.459> seen<00:04:15.640> some<00:04:15.820> people<00:04:16.090> want

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
of the slate I've seen some people want

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.440 
of the slate I've seen some people want
to<00:04:16.770> pick<00:04:17.770> it<00:04:17.920> up<00:04:18.070> they<00:04:18.340> they'll<00:04:18.820> drag<00:04:19.120> it<00:04:19.270> down

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
to pick it up they they'll drag it down

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.450 
to pick it up they they'll drag it down
and<00:04:19.690> pick<00:04:19.870> it<00:04:20.020> up<00:04:20.140> and<00:04:20.260> put<00:04:20.440> it<00:04:20.500> back<00:04:20.650> down<00:04:20.709> it

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:21.460 
and pick it up and put it back down it

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.969 
and pick it up and put it back down it
never<00:04:21.729> leaves<00:04:22.000> the<00:04:22.210> surface<00:04:22.440> I'm<00:04:23.440> making<00:04:23.650> it

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
never leaves the surface I'm making it

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:25.469 
never leaves the surface I'm making it
doesn't<00:04:24.310> make<00:04:24.400> any<00:04:24.460> noise<00:04:24.640> when<00:04:24.820> you<00:04:25.150> drag<00:04:25.450> it

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
doesn't make any noise when you drag it

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:26.260 
doesn't make any noise when you drag it
back<00:04:25.930> in

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
back in

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.930 
back in
direction<00:04:26.620> so<00:04:27.620> it's<00:04:28.069> only<00:04:28.250> making<00:04:28.550> the<00:04:28.759> noise

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
direction so it's only making the noise

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:34.140 
direction so it's only making the noise
when<00:04:29.810> you're<00:04:29.960> dragging<00:04:30.349> it<00:04:30.470> down<00:04:33.039> alright

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
when you're dragging it down alright

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.879 
when you're dragging it down alright
next<00:04:35.150> thing<00:04:35.330> let's<00:04:35.539> talk<00:04:35.720> about<00:04:35.870> how<00:04:36.409> to<00:04:36.440> cut

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889 
next thing let's talk about how to cut

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:40.059 
next thing let's talk about how to cut
on<00:04:37.099> a<00:04:37.159> slate<00:04:38.080> fairly<00:04:39.080> similar<00:04:39.560> you're<00:04:39.949> going

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:40.069 
on a slate fairly similar you're going

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:41.710 
on a slate fairly similar you're going
to<00:04:40.129> put<00:04:40.280> a<00:04:40.310> little<00:04:40.550> bit<00:04:40.729> more<00:04:40.909> pressure<00:04:41.210> on<00:04:41.419> it

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
to put a little bit more pressure on it

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.640 
to put a little bit more pressure on it
and<00:04:42.009> I<00:04:43.009> don't<00:04:43.759> angle<00:04:44.180> it<00:04:44.270> oh<00:04:44.449> you<00:04:45.289> know<00:04:45.379> I<00:04:45.409> ain't

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
and I don't angle it oh you know I ain't

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.409 
and I don't angle it oh you know I ain't
going<00:04:45.889> straight<00:04:46.280> more<00:04:46.520> straight<00:04:46.879> away<00:04:46.909> from

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
going straight more straight away from

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:48.969 
going straight more straight away from
me<00:04:47.539> instead<00:04:47.810> of<00:04:47.870> off<00:04:48.080> to<00:04:48.259> the<00:04:48.349> side<00:04:48.560> like<00:04:48.590> I<00:04:48.919> do

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:48.979 
me instead of off to the side like I do

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:51.939 
me instead of off to the side like I do
on<00:04:49.129> a<00:04:49.479> Yelp<00:04:50.479> I<00:04:50.659> angle<00:04:51.139> it<00:04:51.199> more<00:04:51.379> straight<00:04:51.590> away

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:51.949 
on a Yelp I angle it more straight away

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:55.990 
on a Yelp I angle it more straight away
and<00:04:52.159> not<00:04:52.819> as<00:04:53.000> much<00:04:53.210> and<00:04:53.650> I<00:04:54.650> I<00:04:54.949> do<00:04:55.220> pull<00:04:55.610> it<00:04:55.639> down

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
and not as much and I I do pull it down

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.920 
and not as much and I I do pull it down
with<00:04:56.780> my<00:04:56.960> use<00:04:57.409> my<00:04:57.560> fingers<00:04:57.949> on<00:04:58.099> it<00:04:58.129> too<00:04:58.909> I<00:04:59.240> put<00:04:59.900> a

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
with my use my fingers on it too I put a

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.870 
with my use my fingers on it too I put a
little<00:05:00.050> bit<00:05:00.199> more<00:05:00.289> pressure<00:05:00.500> on<00:05:00.710> it<00:05:00.919> so<00:05:01.430> it's

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
little bit more pressure on it so it's

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.510 
little bit more pressure on it so it's
not<00:05:02.090> wanting<00:05:02.509> to<00:05:02.539> release<00:05:03.430> finally<00:05:04.430> the

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
not wanting to release finally the

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:24.580 
not wanting to release finally the
pressure<00:05:04.759> builds<00:05:05.120> until<00:05:05.330> it<00:05:05.449> releases<00:05:23.560> so<00:05:24.560> a

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
pressure builds until it releases so a

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.020 
pressure builds until it releases so a
little<00:05:24.830> bit<00:05:25.009> more<00:05:25.190> pressure<00:05:25.460> it's<00:05:25.729> a<00:05:25.789> little

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
little bit more pressure it's a little

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.350 
little bit more pressure it's a little
bit<00:05:26.120> more<00:05:26.300> aggressive<00:05:26.389> sound<00:05:27.909> more<00:05:28.909> excited

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
bit more aggressive sound more excited

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.360 
bit more aggressive sound more excited
Salem<00:05:29.719> say<00:05:30.169> and<00:05:30.440> you<00:05:30.770> are<00:05:30.919> going<00:05:31.069> to<00:05:31.159> put<00:05:31.340> a

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
Salem say and you are going to put a

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.070 
Salem say and you are going to put a
little<00:05:31.580> bit<00:05:31.759> more<00:05:31.909> pressure<00:05:32.150> on<00:05:32.389> it<00:05:32.599> now<00:05:32.719> if

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
little bit more pressure on it now if

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.350 
little bit more pressure on it now if
you<00:05:33.139> want<00:05:33.319> to<00:05:33.349> clock<00:05:33.620> just<00:05:33.949> back<00:05:34.580> off<00:05:34.759> same<00:05:35.120> the

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
you want to clock just back off same the

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.040 
you want to clock just back off same the
same<00:05:35.770> way<00:05:36.770> that<00:05:37.009> you<00:05:37.190> do<00:05:37.400> a<00:05:37.639> cut<00:05:38.240> but<00:05:38.719> it's<00:05:38.750> just

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
same way that you do a cut but it's just

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:49.510 
same way that you do a cut but it's just
not<00:05:39.080> quite<00:05:39.380> as<00:05:39.620> aggressive<00:05:46.779> then<00:05:47.779> /<00:05:48.710> and<00:05:48.979> /<00:05:49.039> and

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
not quite as aggressive then / and / and

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.589 
not quite as aggressive then / and / and
clock<00:05:49.759> is<00:05:49.969> another<00:05:50.569> very<00:05:50.960> useful<00:05:51.319> call<00:05:52.599> killed

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:53.599 
clock is another very useful call killed

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:55.269 
clock is another very useful call killed
a<00:05:53.719> lot<00:05:53.870> of<00:05:53.930> turkeys<00:05:54.380> using<00:05:54.650> a<00:05:54.710> part<00:05:54.919> and<00:05:55.039> cluck

00:05:58.809 --> 00:05:58.819 
and to do that your I do it more like I

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:01.870 
and to do that your I do it more like I
I<00:05:59.539> dragged<00:06:00.229> the<00:06:00.469> striker<00:06:00.979> across<00:06:01.430> the<00:06:01.639> surface

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:01.880 
I dragged the striker across the surface

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.309 
I dragged the striker across the surface
similar<00:06:02.870> to<00:06:03.080> a<00:06:03.110> Yelp<00:06:03.500> but<00:06:04.990> with<00:06:05.990> just<00:06:06.169> the

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:06.319 
similar to a Yelp but with just the

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:07.930 
similar to a Yelp but with just the
right<00:06:06.349> amount<00:06:06.529> of<00:06:06.889> pressure<00:06:06.949> to<00:06:07.490> where<00:06:07.699> the

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:07.940 
right amount of pressure to where the

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.600 
right amount of pressure to where the
striker<00:06:08.810> kind<00:06:09.259> of<00:06:09.380> bounces<00:06:09.949> as<00:06:10.159> it<00:06:10.370> moves

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
striker kind of bounces as it moves

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:20.980 
striker kind of bounces as it moves
across<00:06:10.819> the<00:06:11.590> the<00:06:12.590> surface<00:06:18.669> and<00:06:19.750> then<00:06:20.750> I<00:06:20.810> have<00:06:20.960> a

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:20.990 
across the the surface and then I have a

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:22.300 
across the the surface and then I have a
little<00:06:21.139> cluck<00:06:21.409> right<00:06:21.650> there<00:06:21.800> at<00:06:21.889> the<00:06:21.919> end<00:06:22.130> of
