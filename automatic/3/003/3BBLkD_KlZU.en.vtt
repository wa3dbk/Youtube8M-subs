00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080
 the fundamental principle of hermeneutics 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:11.099
 the basis of all the rules of 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:15.839
 hermeneutics is the bible interprets the 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:19.380
 own bible first rule of 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:23.550
 hermeneutics take the words both 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:26.580
 as possible in the usual sense and 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.220
 according to their time to take 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:35.180
 words as much as possible in the 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.180
 common sense of his time 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.680
 The Bible is not, for example, a book of 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.850
 Sciences 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.840
 so she does not use a language 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.480
 scientific 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.920
 it is being directed at people 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.160
 common 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.490
 so its language is a language 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.990
 common lot of times writers 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:07.170
 they used figures parabolas symbols and this 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:10.310
 was known and understood by his 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:14.940
 your readers 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:20.340
 Let's take a Genesis chapter 6 example 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:25.400
 verse 12 the revised version of the 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:30.090
 corrected says and saw god to earth and 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:33.900
 was corrupted because all flesh 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:38.660
 There was cocoon I asked for your way 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:42.740
 on earth, imagine if this text is 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.740
 interpreted to the letter 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.819
 [Music] 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:57.680
 now think as author who writes 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:00.950
 to an audience that understood 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.590
 according to their culture with the 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.620
 illustrations of the time with the 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:11.440
 time they understood that the flesh in this 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:15.080
 Context sentences 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:18.620
 means in this context customs in the 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.050
 revised and updated this verse is 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.200
 translated more clearly says 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:29.000
 so saw god to the earth 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:32.720
 and behold, it was broken that all 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:37.040
 to be alive had corrupted his 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:40.250
 way on earth no longer vehicle is still 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.910
 the clearer she says so God looked at 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:48.320
 the world and saw that it was full of sin 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:52.730
 because all people only did things 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:56.420
 but it 's interesting now because the same 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:59.630
 thought is transmitted by paulo however 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.430
 without figures in Romans chapter 3 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:06.380
 verse 12 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.730
 paulo says everyone was lost there is not any 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.239
 who does good 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:15.709
 no one is even more an example 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:21.590
 just look at the use of the parable lucas chapter 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:25.910
 15 verse 8 or who is the woman who 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:31.720
 having 10 drachmas if you lose one 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:36.019
 light the candle sweeps the house and the search 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:40.130
 diligently until you find it here. 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:43.010
 You speak of a reality of the time 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.170
 if a woman lost her drachma 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.560
 she would look carefully until 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:51.560
 find her and her listeners knew 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:55.720
 But what you do is use 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:58.600
 some elements of this example as 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.220
 light of a greater truth he uses a 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.340
 commonplace example 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:07.030
 throughout the day to day in their time to 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:10.600
 to illustrate a truth and spiritual 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.650
 if this verse was interpreted at the foot 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.650
 of the letter 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:17.739
 ever the reader will understand what jesus 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:21.640
 indeed intended to say the text that we 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:25.080
 we read the woman symbolizes christ 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:29.070
 the hard work of that woman, or 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:33.100
 to ascend the candle sweep the house 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:36.280
 look for each corner with great care 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:40.210
 of the house a single currency of the ten that she 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:43.000
 had previously symbolized the 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.790
 ministry that Christ was and 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.960
 developing the lost drachma in the 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:52.180
 parable symbolizes man's condition 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.630
 lost in sin 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:59.020
 in another moment the own lord jesus 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:03.190
 will express this same truth however 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:07.930
 without making use of a parable he says 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:11.770
 in Luke chapter 19 verse 10 because 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:14.400
 the son of man came to seek and save the 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.400
 lost
