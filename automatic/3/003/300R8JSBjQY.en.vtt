00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:18.840
 Hello guys 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.850
 Today I'm going to show you our sensor. 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.130
 of rain people possible, well cool and 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.710
 You're detecting rain and 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.330
 looking at a clothesline something like that 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.849
 It's very interesting. It 's very sensitive. 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.180
 any drop of water he already detects 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.340
 here is the driver to work and if 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.520
 sensor on the sensor. 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.250
 in that of long ago has tracks in 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.129
 both sides and here we have the driver 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.680
 that detect the sensor sensor 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.620
 following a drop of water 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.989
 that water will drive energy between 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.899
 these trails so I cook energy 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.090
 here is this drive that will identify this 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.710
 this conduction of energy that the 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.500
 operational amplifier this pec 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.500
 can we use analog output or can we 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.010
 use the digital output and sensor of good 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.840
 cool 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.260
 how will we show you in our 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:14.270
 here we have a kick project 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.960
 we have the proof bites the display the arduino 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.020
 our sensor 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.850
 So we're proud of Grandma. 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.350
 when powering connect 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.479
 We already have the project in 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.610
 let's zoom in on the 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.360
 display and the card for us 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.840
 visualize the result we have the sensor 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.270
 here and we have the value zero for 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.180
 Percent moisture is detected in that 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.649
 be lay a hand on the sensor and will have 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.970
 mark a little more 11 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:47.820
 we have a drop account 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.579
 we see put a drop of water on 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:56.189
 the sensor to see the result 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:59.600
 so come note that the unit was 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:05.040
 to about 53 to 50 percent 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:14.489
 this percentage is conducted in the 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:16.709
 sensor card the king and will stay 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.640
 flashing the message here on the display . 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:22.980
 raining 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.640
 just to warn you that there is a 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.660
 rain 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:32.519
 Let's have some more drips to see until 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:35.940
 as value 69 67 short 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:38.310
 depends on the withdrawal of water or 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.910
 even the acidity of the pH water 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.709
 Water 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.450
 basically this is very personal 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.450
 Thank you and see you next time
