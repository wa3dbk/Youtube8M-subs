00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
texture matching is very very very

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.460 
texture matching is very very very
important<00:01:22.570> when<00:01:23.570> I<00:01:23.630> first<00:01:23.899> started<00:01:24.200> wearing

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
press so it matched perfectly the height

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.380 
press so it matched perfectly the height
of<00:01:28.790> it<00:01:28.880> got<00:01:29.259> the<00:01:30.259> less<00:01:30.500> I<00:01:30.680> could<00:01:30.740> wear<00:01:31.100> it

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
of it got the less I could wear it

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.639 
of it got the less I could wear it
because<00:01:32.390> the<00:01:32.659> tension<00:01:32.869> it<00:01:33.110> matched<00:01:33.320> as<00:01:33.500> you

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
because the tension it matched as you

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:38.560 
because the tension it matched as you
can<00:01:33.799> see<00:01:33.979> this<00:01:34.490> is<00:01:34.700> me<00:01:36.729> so<00:01:37.729> there's<00:01:38.149> no<00:01:38.360> way

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
that it really looked great so then for

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.849 
that it really looked great so then for

a photo shoot about a week and a half

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:07.449 
a photo shoot about a week and a half
later<00:03:01.130> I<00:03:01.670> curls<00:03:02.329> it<00:03:02.450> again<00:03:03.430> and<00:03:06.040> it<00:03:07.040> was<00:03:07.280> great

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
later I curls it again and it was great

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.009 
later I curls it again and it was great
and<00:03:07.639> I<00:03:07.730> had<00:03:07.819> left<00:03:08.060> these<00:03:08.239> curls<00:03:08.569> in<00:03:08.720> for<00:03:08.870> about

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
and I had left these curls in for about

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.660 
and I had left these curls in for about
four<00:03:09.290> days<00:03:09.319> so<00:03:09.859> I<00:03:09.889> didn't<00:03:10.130> have<00:03:10.190> to<00:03:10.340> curl<00:03:10.549> it

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
four days so I didn't have to curl it

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:11.370 
four days so I didn't have to curl it
again<00:03:10.850> ever

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
again ever

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.500 
again ever
so<00:03:12.380> I<00:03:12.410> said<00:03:12.620> I<00:03:12.680> want<00:03:12.889> it<00:03:12.920> straight<00:03:13.220> again<00:03:13.579> what

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
so I said I want it straight again what

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.390 
so I said I want it straight again what
happens<00:03:14.900> if<00:03:15.230> I<00:03:15.350> wash<00:03:15.560> it<00:03:15.590> how<00:03:15.889> straight<00:03:16.190> can<00:03:16.310> I

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
happens if I wash it how straight can I

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.940 
happens if I wash it how straight can I
get<00:03:16.549> it<00:03:16.700> so<00:03:17.600> I<00:03:17.630> washed<00:03:17.900> it<00:03:18.139> thinking<00:03:18.470> that<00:03:18.680> the

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
get it so I washed it thinking that the

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.069 
get it so I washed it thinking that the
curls<00:03:19.250> will<00:03:19.340> wash<00:03:19.519> out<00:03:19.790> and<00:03:20.150> I<00:03:20.720> could<00:03:20.900> start

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
curls will wash out and I could start

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:25.180 
curls will wash out and I could start
from<00:03:21.170> scratch<00:03:22.900> so<00:03:23.900> I<00:03:23.930> washed<00:03:24.290> the<00:03:24.560> curls<00:03:24.920> in

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
from scratch so I washed the curls in

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.729 
from scratch so I washed the curls in
some<00:03:25.910> lukewarm<00:03:26.299> water<00:03:26.359> with<00:03:26.840> some<00:03:27.169> shampoo

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
some lukewarm water with some shampoo

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.770 
some lukewarm water with some shampoo
then<00:03:28.010> I<00:03:28.040> conditioned<00:03:28.639> it<00:03:28.760> added<00:03:29.419> a<00:03:29.479> little<00:03:29.570> bit

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
then I conditioned it added a little bit

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
then I conditioned it added a little bit
of<00:03:29.870> softener

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
of softener

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.340 
of softener
thinking<00:03:31.610> that<00:03:31.820> when<00:03:32.480> I<00:03:32.510> hung<00:03:32.750> it<00:03:32.870> up<00:03:32.960> to<00:03:33.110> dry

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
thinking that when I hung it up to dry

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.080 
thinking that when I hung it up to dry
it<00:03:33.710> would<00:03:33.950> dry<00:03:34.130> straight<00:03:34.460> and<00:03:34.640> I<00:03:34.700> could<00:03:34.880> start

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
it would dry straight and I could start

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.290 
it would dry straight and I could start
from<00:03:35.210> scratch<00:03:35.950> but<00:03:36.950> no<00:03:37.190> it<00:03:37.460> came<00:03:37.760> out<00:03:37.940> curled

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
from scratch but no it came out curled

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.710 
from scratch but no it came out curled
again<00:03:38.950> so<00:03:39.950> it's<00:03:40.790> a<00:03:40.850> little<00:03:40.970> bit<00:03:41.120> awkward<00:03:41.300> so<00:03:41.540> I

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
again so it's a little bit awkward so I

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.300 
again so it's a little bit awkward so I
was<00:03:41.840> like<00:03:41.990> wow<00:03:42.170> it<00:03:42.470> really<00:03:42.770> holds<00:03:42.950> curl<00:03:43.250> I

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
was like wow it really holds curl I

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.190 
was like wow it really holds curl I
haven't<00:03:43.730> seen<00:03:43.970> synthetic<00:03:44.510> hair<00:03:44.690> that<00:03:44.870> really

haven't seen synthetic hair that really

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.250 
haven't seen synthetic hair that really
you<00:03:45.350> know<00:03:45.490> do<00:03:46.490> this<00:03:46.700> so<00:03:47.630> I<00:03:47.660> wanted<00:03:47.960> to<00:03:48.020> wear<00:03:48.230> it

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
straight I straightened it again and

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.480 
straight I straightened it again and
that's<00:03:50.360> you<00:03:50.600> can<00:03:50.780> see<00:03:50.990> one<00:03:51.770> side<00:03:51.800> is<00:03:52.130> the<00:03:52.250> curl

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
that's you can see one side is the curl

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.190 
that's you can see one side is the curl
from<00:03:52.670> washing<00:03:53.120> and<00:03:53.240> other<00:03:53.390> side<00:03:53.660> is<00:03:53.810> me<00:03:53.930> flat

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
from washing and other side is me flat

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.620 
from washing and other side is me flat
ironing<00:03:54.530> it<00:03:54.680> and<00:03:54.920> I<00:03:55.820> was<00:03:56.000> able<00:03:56.150> to<00:03:56.330> wear<00:03:56.480> it

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
ironing it and I was able to wear it

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.460 
ironing it and I was able to wear it
straight<00:03:56.900> for<00:03:57.080> the<00:03:57.170> next<00:03:57.440> couple<00:03:57.710> of<00:03:57.800> days

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
straight for the next couple of days

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.780 
straight for the next couple of days
and<00:04:00.470> after<00:04:00.770> that<00:04:00.890> I<00:04:00.950> didn't<00:04:01.370> really<00:04:01.460> wear<00:04:01.760> it

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
and after that I didn't really wear it

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.400 
and after that I didn't really wear it
too<00:04:02.030> much<00:04:02.180> because<00:04:02.420> the<00:04:02.720> weather<00:04:02.930> started

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
too much because the weather started

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.610 
too much because the weather started
changing<00:04:03.620> and<00:04:04.070> so<00:04:04.940> the<00:04:05.120> warmer<00:04:05.450> it<00:04:05.480> got<00:04:05.780> the

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
changing and so the warmer it got the

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.260
