want the camera in the same hole that
you're<00:02:06.810> fishing<00:02:07.140> because<00:02:07.500> official<00:02:07.920> get<00:02:08.009> all

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
tangled up so by suspending it out from

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.960 
tangled up so by suspending it out from
a<00:02:10.500> distance<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:11.069> then<00:02:11.190> looking<00:02:11.489> back<00:02:11.550> at

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
a distance and then looking back at

watch from a safe distance so your

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.740 
watch from a safe distance so your

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
of cord laying around can get crimped or

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.150 
of cord laying around can get crimped or
damaged<00:05:08.509> or<00:05:08.690> stepped<00:05:09.020> on<00:05:09.229> you<00:05:09.770> want<00:05:10.039> to<00:05:10.099> make

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
damaged or stepped on you want to make

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.860 
damaged or stepped on you want to make
sure<00:05:10.310> you<00:05:10.580> always<00:05:10.789> keep<00:05:11.000> it<00:05:11.300> on<00:05:11.360> there<00:05:11.570> on<00:05:11.720> the

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
sure you always keep it on there on the

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.689 
sure you always keep it on there on the
wrapper<00:05:12.080> here<00:05:12.470> and<00:05:12.590> this<00:05:12.740> in<00:05:12.949> this<00:05:13.160> cable<00:05:13.370> wrap

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:13.699 
wrapper here and this in this cable wrap

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:15.640 
wrapper here and this in this cable wrap
system<00:05:14.120> that<00:05:14.270> we<00:05:14.360> have<00:05:14.570> with<00:05:15.080> the<00:05:15.169> little<00:05:15.380> ears

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
system that we have with the little ears

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.320 
system that we have with the little ears
on<00:05:15.860> it<00:05:15.979> really<00:05:16.250> makes<00:05:16.520> it<00:05:16.639> easy<00:05:16.940> to<00:05:17.060> stay

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
on it really makes it easy to stay

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.480 
on it really makes it easy to stay
organized<00:05:17.840> so<00:05:18.349> the<00:05:18.470> cables<00:05:18.830> don't<00:05:18.919> go<00:05:19.070> wine

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
organized so the cables don't go wine

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.730 
organized so the cables don't go wine
during<00:05:19.759> unwinding<00:05:20.599> everywhere<00:05:21.020> you<00:05:21.139> go<00:05:21.320> but<00:05:21.650> I

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
during unwinding everywhere you go but I

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:22.510 
during unwinding everywhere you go but I
spit<00:05:22.220> that<00:05:22.340> out

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
spit that out

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.339 
spit that out
so<00:05:23.090> this<00:05:23.240> cable<00:05:23.570> wrap<00:05:23.720> system<00:05:24.110> works

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:24.349 
so this cable wrap system works

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:27.219 
so this cable wrap system works
extremely<00:05:24.680> well<00:05:24.919> now<00:05:25.639> the<00:05:26.120> camera<00:05:26.599> itself<00:05:26.960> and

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:27.229 
extremely well now the camera itself and

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:28.330 
extremely well now the camera itself and
I<00:05:27.259> should<00:05:27.470> mention<00:05:27.650> some<00:05:28.039> of<00:05:28.130> the<00:05:28.190> nice

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
I should mention some of the nice

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.650 
I should mention some of the nice
features<00:05:28.729> about<00:05:28.880> the<00:05:29.120> camera<00:05:29.419> because<00:05:29.570> I

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
features about the camera because I

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.689 
features about the camera because I
didn't<00:05:29.930> really<00:05:30.229> get<00:05:30.320> to<00:05:30.380> it<00:05:30.650> the<00:05:31.190> camera<00:05:31.610> is

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:31.699 
didn't really get to it the camera is

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:33.909 
didn't really get to it the camera is
designed<00:05:31.849> to<00:05:32.180> actually<00:05:32.330> sit<00:05:32.960> on<00:05:33.139> the<00:05:33.409> bottom<00:05:33.530> a

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
designed to actually sit on the bottom a

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:35.409 
designed to actually sit on the bottom a
lot<00:05:34.190> of<00:05:34.310> cameras<00:05:34.639> aren't<00:05:34.849> designed<00:05:35.180> that<00:05:35.300> way

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:35.419 
lot of cameras aren't designed that way

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:37.210 
lot of cameras aren't designed that way
they<00:05:35.510> actually<00:05:35.630> roll<00:05:35.960> over<00:05:36.289> you<00:05:36.800> can<00:05:36.949> often

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
they actually roll over you can often

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.800 
they actually roll over you can often
times<00:05:37.430> that<00:05:37.550> it's<00:05:37.669> sit<00:05:37.909> right<00:05:38.210> on<00:05:38.389> the<00:05:38.510> bottom

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
times that it's sit right on the bottom

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.170 
times that it's sit right on the bottom
and<00:05:38.930> watch<00:05:39.110> if<00:05:40.010> you<00:05:40.310> want<00:05:40.580> some<00:05:40.789> additional

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
and watch if you want some additional

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.500 
and watch if you want some additional
options<00:05:41.740> you<00:05:42.740> can<00:05:42.889> use<00:05:42.949> the<00:05:43.340> lay<00:05:43.970> down<00:05:44.210> view

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
options you can use the lay down view

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.629 
options you can use the lay down view
mode<00:05:44.810> where<00:05:45.380> you<00:05:45.530> simply<00:05:45.889> hook<00:05:46.190> it<00:05:46.310> on<00:05:46.400> to<00:05:46.550> the

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:46.639 
mode where you simply hook it on to the

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:49.870 
mode where you simply hook it on to the
tail<00:05:46.849> of<00:05:47.030> it<00:05:47.120> and<00:05:47.270> let<00:05:47.419> it<00:05:47.510> hang<00:05:47.690> down<00:05:48.400> or<00:05:49.400> if

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 
tail of it and let it hang down or if

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.480 
tail of it and let it hang down or if
you'd<00:05:50.030> like<00:05:50.270> you<00:05:50.960> can<00:05:51.110> add<00:05:51.169> the<00:05:51.530> trolling<00:05:52.099> thin

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 
now the trolling fin attaches to the

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.960 
now the trolling fin attaches to the
back<00:05:54.349> of<00:05:54.530> it<00:05:54.620> just<00:05:54.740> like<00:05:54.830> you<00:05:55.039> see<00:05:55.190> here<00:05:55.430> which

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:55.970 
back of it just like you see here which

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.999 
back of it just like you see here which
makes<00:05:56.270> it<00:05:56.449> suspend<00:05:56.930> exactly<00:05:57.560> perfectly

00:05:57.999 --> 00:05:58.009 
makes it suspend exactly perfectly
