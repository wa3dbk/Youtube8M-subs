option<00:01:15.340> I'll<00:01:16.340> go<00:01:16.520> ahead<00:01:16.610> and<00:01:16.700> create<00:01:16.940> a<00:01:17.180> quick

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
option I'll go ahead and create a quick

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:27.960 
option I'll go ahead and create a quick
sketch<00:01:17.900> on<00:01:18.200> the<00:01:18.650> front<00:01:18.890> plane

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.760 

and<00:01:28.210> I'll<00:01:28.750> go<00:01:28.870> ahead<00:01:28.990> and<00:01:29.110> come<00:01:29.350> back<00:01:29.470> in<00:01:29.620> the

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
and I'll go ahead and come back in the

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.580 
and I'll go ahead and come back in the
sheet<00:01:30.010> metal<00:01:30.130> tab<00:01:30.520> and<00:01:31.230> choose<00:01:32.230> the<00:01:32.410> base

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
sheet metal tab and choose the base

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.310 
sheet metal tab and choose the base
flange<00:01:32.890> tab<00:01:33.220> and<00:01:33.510> this<00:01:34.510> works<00:01:34.750> similarly<00:01:35.200> to

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
flange tab and this works similarly to

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.280 
flange tab and this works similarly to
an<00:01:35.920> extrusion<00:01:36.580> it<00:01:37.120> will<00:01:37.240> select<00:01:37.600> the<00:01:37.780> sketch

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
an extrusion it will select the sketch

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.610 
an extrusion it will select the sketch
allow<00:01:41.290> you<00:01:41.350> to<00:01:41.560> choose<00:01:41.890> a<00:01:42.220> distance<00:01:43.620> similarly

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
allow you to choose a distance similarly

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.040 
allow you to choose a distance similarly
to<00:01:44.830> an<00:01:44.980> extrusion<00:01:45.340> we<00:01:45.820> can<00:01:45.970> take<00:01:46.480> this<00:01:46.660> up<00:01:46.870> to<00:01:46.900> a

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
to an extrusion we can take this up to a

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.160 
to an extrusion we can take this up to a
vertex<00:01:47.440> up<00:01:48.010> to<00:01:48.250> a<00:01:48.310> surface<00:01:48.870> offset<00:01:49.870> it<00:01:49.990> from<00:01:50.140> a

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
vertex up to a surface offset it from a

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.110 
vertex up to a surface offset it from a
surface<00:01:50.470> or<00:01:50.740> create<00:01:50.980> a<00:01:51.010> mid<00:01:51.280> plane<00:01:51.490> extrusion

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 
surface or create a mid plane extrusion

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.470 
surface or create a mid plane extrusion
and<00:01:52.210> then<00:01:53.110> we<00:01:53.230> have<00:01:53.350> a<00:01:53.380> direction<00:01:53.710> to<00:01:54.180> where<00:01:55.180> we

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480 
and then we have a direction to where we

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.910 
and then we have a direction to where we
can<00:01:55.600> do<00:01:55.720> similar<00:01:57.690> the<00:01:58.690> next<00:01:58.930> option<00:01:59.080> is<00:01:59.470> to<00:01:59.890> use

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
can do similar the next option is to use

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.000 
can do similar the next option is to use
a<00:02:00.220> gauge<00:02:00.610> table<00:02:01.350> so<00:02:02.350> if<00:02:02.440> you<00:02:02.560> have<00:02:02.710> a<00:02:02.740> sheet

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
a gauge table so if you have a sheet

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.370 
a gauge table so if you have a sheet
metal<00:02:03.160> gauge<00:02:03.520> table<00:02:03.910> of<00:02:04.090> your<00:02:04.240> own<00:02:04.420> you<00:02:05.350> can

that the dimensions will change once you

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.089 
that the dimensions will change once you

dimensions for each base flange that you

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.020 
dimensions for each base flange that you
create<00:04:22.699> so<00:04:23.599> you'll<00:04:23.750> be<00:04:23.930> able<00:04:23.960> to<00:04:24.169> modify<00:04:24.500> those
