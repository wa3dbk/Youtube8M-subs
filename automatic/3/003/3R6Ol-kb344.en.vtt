00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
probably have to be not critics although

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.120 
probably have to be not critics although
that's<00:00:17.430> pretty<00:00:17.850> close<00:00:18.150> my<00:00:18.840> worst<00:00:19.410> my<00:00:19.830> least

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
that's pretty close my worst my least

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.220 
that's pretty close my worst my least
favorite<00:00:20.520> is<00:00:20.670> when<00:00:21.000> I<00:00:21.390> opponent<00:00:21.660> gets<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.840> burn

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
favorite is when I opponent gets a burn

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.189 
favorite is when I opponent gets a burn
or<00:00:22.529> freeze<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:23.609> think<00:00:23.850> freeze<00:00:24.240> more<00:00:24.600> so<00:00:24.930> yeah

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
or freeze I think freeze more so yeah

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.929 
or freeze I think freeze more so yeah
when<00:00:25.710> my<00:00:25.800> brother<00:00:25.980> gets<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.220> freeze<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.789> nice

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
when my brother gets a freeze of a nice

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.220 
when my brother gets a freeze of a nice
tight<00:00:27.180> move<00:00:27.380> annoys<00:00:28.380> me<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.650> no<00:00:28.769> end<00:00:30.230> because

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
tight move annoys me to no end because

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.819 
tight move annoys me to no end because
it's<00:00:31.470> just<00:00:31.500> so<00:00:31.710> lucky<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.930> it<00:00:33.930> does<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:34.410> much

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
it's just so lucky and it does so much

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.030 
it's just so lucky and it does so much
like<00:00:35.100> freeze<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.670> probably<00:00:35.940> like<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.300> best<00:00:36.600> um

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
like freeze is probably like the best um

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.110 
like freeze is probably like the best um
status<00:00:38.040> condition<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.610> entire<00:00:38.850> game

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
status condition in the entire game

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.330 
status condition in the entire game
because<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.200> completely<00:00:40.620> freezes<00:00:40.890> you<00:00:41.100> can't

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
because it completely freezes you can't

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.779 
because it completely freezes you can't
do<00:00:41.520> anything<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:43.250> there's<00:00:44.250> nothing<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.700> can

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
do anything and there's nothing you can

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.510 
do anything and there's nothing you can
do<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:46.110> think<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.530> takes<00:00:46.559> longer<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.430> get

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
do and it I think it takes longer to get

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.060 
do and it I think it takes longer to get
rid<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:47.730> than<00:00:48.000> sleep<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:49.350> he<00:00:49.620> gets<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.860> whole

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
rid of than sleep and so he gets a whole

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.950 
rid of than sleep and so he gets a whole
bunch<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.370> reward<00:00:50.789> for<00:00:51.420> just<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.690> whole<00:00:51.930> bunch

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
bunch of reward for just a whole bunch

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.889 
bunch of reward for just a whole bunch
of<00:00:52.260> luck<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:52.770> just<00:00:52.949> hate<00:00:53.370> freeze<00:00:53.879> acts<00:00:54.090> but

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
you know just to a seed flare it and i

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.469 
you know just to a seed flare it and i
go<00:01:50.189> over<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.399> seed<00:01:50.610> flare<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.119> i<00:01:51.210> end<00:01:51.360> up

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
go over the seed flare and i end up

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.460 
go over the seed flare and i end up
getting<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.990> crit<00:01:52.979> on<00:01:53.159> this<00:01:53.399> um<00:01:53.640> this<00:01:54.200> thing<00:01:55.200> and

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
getting a crit on this um this thing and

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.630 
getting a crit on this um this thing and
i<00:01:55.560> don't<00:01:55.710> think<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:55.920> really<00:01:55.950> mattered<00:01:56.340> anyway

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
i don't think it really mattered anyway

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.340 
i don't think it really mattered anyway
because<00:01:56.759> I've<00:01:56.909> been<00:01:57.030> able<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.329> AKO<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:58.049> so<00:01:58.320> I

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
because I've been able to AKO it so I

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.660 
because I've been able to AKO it so I
don't<00:01:58.619> think<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.829> really<00:01:58.860> mattered<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.460> much

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
don't think it really mattered to much

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.670 
don't think it really mattered to much
but<00:02:00.299> um<00:02:00.360> he<00:02:00.600> goes<00:02:00.750> in<00:02:00.869> Tampa<00:02:01.170> palm<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.560> just

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
but um he goes in Tampa palm and I just

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.230 
but um he goes in Tampa palm and I just
go<00:02:01.770> back<00:02:01.950> into<00:02:02.100> steelix<00:02:02.490> no<00:02:02.640> example<00:02:03.119> palm

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
go back into steelix no example palm

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.270 
go back into steelix no example palm
can't<00:02:03.570> do<00:02:03.719> anything<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.170> steelix<00:02:04.500> because<00:02:05.189> i

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
can't do anything to steelix because i

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.980 
can't do anything to steelix because i
know<00:02:05.340> it's<00:02:05.549> only<00:02:05.640> moves<00:02:05.969> or<00:02:06.210> normal<00:02:06.780> types

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
know it's only moves or normal types

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.710 
know it's only moves or normal types
moves<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.220> anyway<00:02:08.940> he's<00:02:09.149> actually<00:02:09.300> tries<00:02:09.690> a

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
moves and anyway he's actually tries a

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.720 
moves and anyway he's actually tries a
last<00:02:10.050> resort<00:02:10.289> on<00:02:10.470> steelix<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:11.280> doesn't<00:02:11.610> do<00:02:11.700> a

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
last resort on steelix it doesn't do a

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.520 
last resort on steelix it doesn't do a
whole<00:02:11.790> lot<00:02:11.970> as<00:02:12.360> he<00:02:12.450> gets<00:02:12.629> ko'd<00:02:13.020> and<00:02:13.319> I

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
whole lot as he gets ko'd and I

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.870 
whole lot as he gets ko'd and I
for<00:02:13.800> toxic<00:02:14.340> because<00:02:14.430> I<00:02:14.550> was<00:02:14.700> kind<00:02:14.850> of

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
for toxic because I was kind of

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.000 
for toxic because I was kind of
predicting<00:02:15.270> a<00:02:15.300> switch<00:02:15.540> or<00:02:15.690> something<00:02:15.810> but<00:02:16.620> he

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
predicting a switch or something but he

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.500 
predicting a switch or something but he
doesn't<00:02:17.280> switch<00:02:17.459> he<00:02:17.580> just<00:02:17.730> last<00:02:18.030> resorts<00:02:18.360> me

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
doesn't switch he just last resorts me

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.230 
doesn't switch he just last resorts me
so<00:02:18.959> anyway<00:02:19.260> here<00:02:19.860> is<00:02:20.010> bibarel<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.760> he<00:02:21.090> goes

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
so anyway here is bibarel and he goes

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.970 
so anyway here is bibarel and he goes
back<00:02:21.510> in<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.720> bimmer<00:02:21.930> l<00:02:22.140> now<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:22.650> I'm<00:02:22.890> i

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
back in the bimmer l now and I'm i

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.949 
back in the bimmer l now and I'm i
decided<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.370> go<00:02:23.430> back<00:02:23.730> into<00:02:23.940> shaymin<00:02:24.420> but<00:02:24.870> he

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
decided to go back into shaymin but he

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.330 
decided to go back into shaymin but he
actually<00:02:25.110> did<00:02:25.319> something<00:02:25.500> pretty<00:02:25.830> funny<00:02:26.190> and

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
actually did something pretty funny and

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.850 
actually did something pretty funny and
Amnesia's<00:02:26.940> so<00:02:27.330> now<00:02:27.810> a<00:02:27.840> special<00:02:28.140> defense<00:02:28.560> is

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
Amnesia's so now a special defense is

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.520 
Amnesia's so now a special defense is
boosted<00:02:29.430> by<00:02:29.550> four<00:02:29.970> because<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:31.230> Patrol<00:02:31.500> has

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
boosted by four because the Patrol has

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.830 
boosted by four because the Patrol has
this<00:02:31.890> simple<00:02:32.370> special<00:02:32.730> ability<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:33.360> I'm<00:02:33.750> just

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
this simple special ability and I'm just

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.910 
this simple special ability and I'm just
going<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:34.020> suck<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.319> lead<00:02:34.500> sheet<00:02:34.739> on<00:02:34.890> it

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
going to suck the lead sheet on it

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.580 
going to suck the lead sheet on it
because<00:02:35.430> um<00:02:35.790> I'm<00:02:36.660> pretty<00:02:36.780> sure<00:02:37.110> a<00:02:37.140> shame<00:02:37.380> and

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
because um I'm pretty sure a shame and

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.350 
because um I'm pretty sure a shame and
can<00:02:37.680> actually<00:02:37.830> take<00:02:38.250> quick<00:02:38.819> attacks<00:02:39.090> pretty

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
can actually take quick attacks pretty

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.000 
can actually take quick attacks pretty
well<00:02:39.569> because<00:02:39.840> shaymin<00:02:40.350> is<00:02:40.440> a<00:02:40.470> pretty<00:02:40.739> bulky

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
well because shaymin is a pretty bulky

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.550 
well because shaymin is a pretty bulky
guy<00:02:41.340> so<00:02:42.030> I<00:02:42.060> go<00:02:42.270> for<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.480> CD<00:02:42.750> player<00:02:42.959> and<00:02:43.080> I<00:02:43.170> miss

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
guy so I go for the CD player and I miss

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.280 
guy so I go for the CD player and I miss
which<00:02:43.770> is<00:02:43.890> so<00:02:44.250> bad<00:02:44.550> for<00:02:44.580> me<00:02:45.000> I<00:02:45.540> really<00:02:46.080> needed

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
which is so bad for me I really needed

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.140 
which is so bad for me I really needed
to<00:02:46.410> hit<00:02:46.560> because<00:02:47.100> I<00:02:47.160> seat<00:02:47.610> flowers<00:02:47.850> are<00:02:48.030> two

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
to hit because I seat flowers are two

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.780 
to hit because I seat flowers are two
AKO<00:02:48.480> at<00:02:48.660> this<00:02:48.810> point<00:02:49.080> so<00:02:49.650> um<00:02:49.890> yeah<00:02:50.220> I<00:02:50.250> go<00:02:50.610> from

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
AKO at this point so um yeah I go from

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.759 
AKO at this point so um yeah I go from
the<00:02:51.420> CD<00:02:51.660> player<00:02:51.840> again<00:02:52.080> is<00:02:52.110> he<00:02:52.230> quick<00:02:52.500> attacks

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
the CD player again is he quick attacks

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.340 
the CD player again is he quick attacks
and<00:02:53.010> it<00:02:53.310> looks<00:02:53.519> like<00:02:53.610> quick<00:02:54.510> attack<00:02:54.720> is<00:02:54.900> a<00:02:54.930> 3

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
and it looks like quick attack is a 3

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.790 
and it looks like quick attack is a 3
aquella<00:02:55.650> which<00:02:55.920> is<00:02:56.040> epic<00:02:56.400> for<00:02:56.430> me<00:02:56.730> and<00:02:57.800> even

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
aquella which is epic for me and even

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.590 
aquella which is epic for me and even
after<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.430> two<00:02:59.670> curses<00:03:00.090> which<00:03:00.239> is<00:03:00.330> actually<00:03:00.420> a

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
after the two curses which is actually a

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.280 
after the two curses which is actually a
plus<00:03:00.840> for<00:03:01.050> attack<00:03:01.319> form<00:03:01.620> and<00:03:03.290> unfortunately

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
plus for attack form and unfortunately

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.559 
plus for attack form and unfortunately
he<00:03:04.530> gets<00:03:04.709> a<00:03:04.830> crit<00:03:05.370> off<00:03:05.580> the<00:03:05.850> other<00:03:06.030> quick

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
he gets a crit off the other quick

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.259 
he gets a crit off the other quick
attack<00:03:06.840> so<00:03:07.140> um<00:03:07.440> this<00:03:08.250> might<00:03:08.730> have<00:03:08.910> one<00:03:09.030> in<00:03:09.150> the

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
attack so um this might have one in the

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:14.570 
attack so um this might have one in the
game<00:03:09.450> right<00:03:09.840> here<00:03:10.610> because<00:03:12.410> if<00:03:13.410> I<00:03:14.040> wouldn't

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
game right here because if I wouldn't

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.059 
game right here because if I wouldn't
have<00:03:14.640> gotten<00:03:14.940> that<00:03:15.180> crit<00:03:15.569> and<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:16.200> Miss<00:03:16.440> like

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
have gotten that crit and the Miss like

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.910 
have gotten that crit and the Miss like
I<00:03:17.220> got<00:03:17.400> a<00:03:17.430> Miss<00:03:17.700> endocrine<00:03:18.420> so<00:03:18.720> um<00:03:18.959> if<00:03:19.799> you

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
I got a Miss endocrine so um if you

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.460 
I got a Miss endocrine so um if you
wouldn't<00:03:20.130> have<00:03:20.250> gotten<00:03:20.489> those<00:03:20.790> I<00:03:21.209> feel<00:03:22.200> pretty

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
wouldn't have gotten those I feel pretty

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.289 
wouldn't have gotten those I feel pretty
confident<00:03:23.040> that<00:03:23.160> I<00:03:23.640> would<00:03:23.910> have<00:03:24.000> won<00:03:24.150> this

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
confident that I would have won this

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.380 
confident that I would have won this
match<00:03:24.540> because<00:03:24.870> now<00:03:25.170> I<00:03:25.200> have<00:03:25.380> to<00:03:25.850> waste<00:03:26.850> helix

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
match because now I have to waste helix

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.229 
match because now I have to waste helix
trying<00:03:27.630> to<00:03:27.720> toxic<00:03:28.200> the<00:03:28.350> thing<00:03:28.560> so<00:03:29.190> um<00:03:29.459> he<00:03:30.090> goes

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
trying to toxic the thing so um he goes

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.479 
trying to toxic the thing so um he goes
for<00:03:30.390> the<00:03:30.450> waterfall<00:03:30.870> takes<00:03:31.140> down<00:03:31.320> steelix<00:03:31.799> so

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
for the waterfall takes down steelix so

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.500 
for the waterfall takes down steelix so
this<00:03:32.940> isn't<00:03:33.299> good<00:03:33.480> for<00:03:33.690> me<00:03:34.040> and<00:03:35.299> you'll<00:03:36.299> see

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
this isn't good for me and you'll see

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.250 
this isn't good for me and you'll see
why<00:03:36.690> later<00:03:36.720> actually<00:03:37.350> if<00:03:38.190> I<00:03:38.459> would<00:03:38.700> have<00:03:38.760> had

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
why later actually if I would have had

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.229 
why later actually if I would have had
Shaymin<00:03:40.260> in<00:03:40.410> the<00:03:40.500> battle<00:03:40.799> later<00:03:41.010> I<00:03:41.280> you<00:03:42.209> know

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
Shaymin in the battle later I you know

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:43.729 
Shaymin in the battle later I you know
we<00:03:42.450> would<00:03:42.570> have<00:03:42.660> made<00:03:42.780> a<00:03:42.810> big<00:03:43.079> difference<00:03:43.320> so<00:03:43.709> I

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
we would have made a big difference so I

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.319 
we would have made a big difference so I
protect<00:03:44.370> as<00:03:44.489> he<00:03:44.609> goes<00:03:44.760> to<00:03:44.880> the<00:03:44.910> amnesia

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
protect as he goes to the amnesia

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.300 
protect as he goes to the amnesia
predicting<00:03:45.870> my<00:03:45.989> protect<00:03:46.410> or<00:03:46.560> something<00:03:46.920> he

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
predicting my protect or something he

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.500 
predicting my protect or something he
probably<00:03:47.519> should<00:03:47.760> have<00:03:47.820> just<00:03:48.000> went<00:03:48.180> for<00:03:48.420> the

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
probably should have just went for the

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.000 
probably should have just went for the
UM<00:03:48.799> what's<00:03:49.799> it<00:03:49.920> called<00:03:50.160> uh<00:03:50.989> curse<00:03:51.989> i<00:03:52.230> guess<00:03:52.440> but

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
UM what's it called uh curse i guess but

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.220 
UM what's it called uh curse i guess but
anyway<00:03:53.340> i<00:03:53.370> need<00:03:54.030> to<00:03:54.150> get<00:03:54.390> the<00:03:54.570> second<00:03:54.900> protect

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
anyway i need to get the second protect

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.220 
anyway i need to get the second protect
and<00:03:55.350> I<00:03:55.380> do<00:03:55.440> get<00:03:55.859> it<00:03:56.010> which<00:03:56.130> is<00:03:56.250> pretty<00:03:56.310> nice<00:03:56.910> and

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
and I do get it which is pretty nice and

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.740 
and I do get it which is pretty nice and
I'm<00:03:58.230> able<00:03:58.380> to<00:03:58.620> he's<00:03:58.920> able<00:03:59.160> to<00:03:59.519> UM<00:03:59.700> well<00:04:00.630> I'm

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
I'm able to he's able to UM well I'm

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.900 
I'm able to he's able to UM well I'm
able<00:04:00.959> to<00:04:01.230> eventually<00:04:01.650> stall<00:04:02.100> out<00:04:02.280> this<00:04:02.519> bit

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
able to eventually stall out this bit

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.699 
able to eventually stall out this bit
morale<00:04:03.150> so<00:04:03.390> the<00:04:03.570> bimmer<00:04:03.720> all<00:04:03.900> goes<00:04:04.109> down<00:04:04.350> and

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
morale so the bimmer all goes down and

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.830 
morale so the bimmer all goes down and
that<00:04:05.370> was<00:04:05.519> a<00:04:05.549> close<00:04:05.730> one<00:04:05.790> so<00:04:06.269> anyway<00:04:06.600> now<00:04:06.780> he

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
that was a close one so anyway now he

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.140 
that was a close one so anyway now he
decides<00:04:06.959> forgot<00:04:07.410> into<00:04:07.709> tobik<00:04:08.100> togetic<00:04:08.910> and

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
decides forgot into tobik togetic and

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.270 
decides forgot into tobik togetic and
i'm<00:04:10.079> pretty<00:04:10.200> sure<00:04:10.440> i<00:04:10.500> can<00:04:10.650> like<00:04:10.799> a<00:04:11.040> it<00:04:11.160> with

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
i'm pretty sure i can like a it with

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.310 
i'm pretty sure i can like a it with
facades<00:04:11.640> well<00:04:11.970> just<00:04:12.120> do<00:04:12.269> that<00:04:12.480> and<00:04:12.750> yeah

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
facades well just do that and yeah

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.659 
facades well just do that and yeah
togetic<00:04:13.829> goes<00:04:14.070> down<00:04:14.370> so<00:04:15.299> um<00:04:15.570> sir<00:04:16.500> was<00:04:17.100> it<00:04:17.220> not

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
togetic goes down so um sir was it not

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.449 
togetic goes down so um sir was it not
not<00:04:18.030> togetic<00:04:18.539> togetic<00:04:19.350> i<00:04:19.919> don't<00:04:20.250> really<00:04:20.340> know

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
not togetic togetic i don't really know

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.339 
not togetic togetic i don't really know
what<00:04:20.640> it's<00:04:20.760> called<00:04:20.820> that's<00:04:21.209> just<00:04:21.780> a<00:04:21.870> guess<00:04:22.049> but

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
what it's called that's just a guess but

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:23.960 
what it's called that's just a guess but
now<00:04:22.650> he<00:04:22.710> goes<00:04:22.860> in<00:04:23.010> the<00:04:23.070> slowbro<00:04:23.700> and<00:04:23.909> I

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
now he goes in the slowbro and I

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.310 
now he goes in the slowbro and I
definitely<00:04:24.510> needed<00:04:25.169> a<00:04:25.289> machine

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
definitely needed a machine

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.770 
definitely needed a machine
slowbro<00:04:26.740> because<00:04:27.190> all<00:04:27.430> I<00:04:27.460> have<00:04:27.730> left<00:04:27.970> is<00:04:28.240> guys

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
slowbro because all I have left is guys

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.620 
slowbro because all I have left is guys
you<00:04:29.020> really<00:04:29.230> can't<00:04:29.620> hurt<00:04:29.800> slowbro<00:04:30.310> so<00:04:30.760> um<00:04:31.030> he

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
you really can't hurt slowbro so um he

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:32.910 
you really can't hurt slowbro so um he
goes<00:04:31.840> for<00:04:32.110> the<00:04:32.200> slack<00:04:32.440> off<00:04:32.710> I<00:04:32.860> guess

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:32.920 
goes for the slack off I guess

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.830 
goes for the slack off I guess
predicting<00:04:33.460> my<00:04:33.610> you<00:04:33.670> turn<00:04:34.000> or<00:04:34.270> whatever<00:04:34.540> made

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
predicting my you turn or whatever made

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.020 
predicting my you turn or whatever made
facade<00:04:35.290> I<00:04:35.320> don't<00:04:35.710> know<00:04:35.800> trying<00:04:36.520> his<00:04:36.670> toxic

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
facade I don't know trying his toxic

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.390 
facade I don't know trying his toxic
stall<00:04:37.240> me<00:04:37.420> or<00:04:37.510> whatever<00:04:37.630> so<00:04:38.410> anyway<00:04:38.740> I'm<00:04:38.980> he

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
dragon dance and I'm hoping earthquake

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.940 
dragon dance and I'm hoping earthquake
as<00:04:43.150> to<00:04:43.330> ako<00:04:43.630> I<00:04:43.990> probably<00:04:44.590> should<00:04:44.770> have<00:04:44.800> gone

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
as to ako I probably should have gone

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.410 
as to ako I probably should have gone
for<00:04:45.130> the<00:04:45.220> second<00:04:45.520> one<00:04:45.640> because<00:04:45.820> it's<00:04:46.090> just<00:04:46.150> not

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:46.420 
for the second one because it's just not

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.350 
for the second one because it's just not
a<00:04:46.630> to<00:04:46.870> ako<00:04:47.170> and<00:04:47.500> he<00:04:48.460> goes<00:04:48.550> for<00:04:48.760> psychic<00:04:49.180> and

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
a to ako and he goes for psychic and

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.500 
a to ako and he goes for psychic and
that's<00:04:49.480> a<00:04:49.540> to<00:04:49.690> AKO<00:04:49.960> for<00:04:50.230> him<00:04:50.440> so<00:04:51.340> um<00:04:51.700> I<00:04:51.910> kind<00:04:52.420> of

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
that's a to AKO for him so um I kind of

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.270 
that's a to AKO for him so um I kind of
I<00:04:52.780> should<00:04:53.470> have<00:04:53.560> went<00:04:53.770> for<00:04:53.860> the<00:04:53.920> earthquake

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
I should have went for the earthquake

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.520 
I should have went for the earthquake
here<00:04:54.430> but<00:04:54.580> I<00:04:54.640> ever<00:04:54.970> predicted<00:04:55.420> thinking<00:04:55.780> slack

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
here but I ever predicted thinking slack

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.440 
here but I ever predicted thinking slack
off<00:04:56.770> and<00:04:56.950> I<00:04:57.010> decided<00:04:57.310> to<00:04:57.550> go<00:04:57.880> for<00:04:58.000> the<00:04:58.090> dragon

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
off and I decided to go for the dragon

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.390 
off and I decided to go for the dragon
dance<00:04:58.630> but<00:04:59.290> he<00:04:59.380> doesn't<00:04:59.800> he<00:04:59.860> just<00:04:59.950> finished<00:05:00.280> me

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
dance but he doesn't he just finished me

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.070 
dance but he doesn't he just finished me
off<00:05:00.430> the<00:05:00.640> psychic<00:05:01.060> so<00:05:01.270> um<00:05:01.450> that's<00:05:01.570> pretty<00:05:01.840> bad
