so for this video you'll probably notice
that<00:00:07.549> I'm<00:00:07.700> running<00:00:07.970> with<00:00:07.999> a<00:00:08.120> little<00:00:08.360> bit<00:00:08.570> of<00:00:08.630> a

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:08.900 
that I'm running with a little bit of a

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:15.730 
home right now but what I really wanted
to<00:00:13.400> focus<00:00:13.519> on<00:00:13.849> was<00:00:14.179> the<00:00:14.330> actual<00:00:14.740> rotation

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:15.740 
to focus on was the actual rotation

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
like chimera shot and try to explain why

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.200 
like chimera shot and try to explain why
you're<00:00:30.890> doing<00:00:31.130> what<00:00:31.340> you're<00:00:31.550> doing<00:00:32.029> when

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
you're using this rotation so I'm going

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.870 
you're using this rotation so I'm going

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.610 
and you want to get as many of them in
as<00:04:33.770> possible<00:04:34.009> so<00:04:34.900> if<00:04:35.900> the<00:04:36.110> target<00:04:36.380> is<00:04:36.440> under

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
as possible so if the target is under

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.550 
as possible so if the target is under
twenty<00:04:36.860> percent<00:04:37.190> that<00:04:37.940> should<00:04:38.300> be<00:04:38.509> your<00:04:39.080> first

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
twenty percent that should be your first

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.589 
twenty percent that should be your first
priority<00:04:40.900> I<00:04:41.900> think<00:04:42.410> that's<00:04:42.530> it<00:04:42.710> for<00:04:43.280> today<00:04:43.599> if

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:44.599 
priority I think that's it for today if

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:50.129 
priority I think that's it for today if
you<00:04:44.720> have<00:04:44.840> any<00:04:44.930> questions<00:04:45.580> comment<00:04:46.580> thanks

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:53.139 

closely
