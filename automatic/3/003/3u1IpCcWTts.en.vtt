00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.000
 Look at the lullaby, we're here in the 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.070
 would cheat in the madalena village a place 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.779
 very special where we not only 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.369
 delicious cheeses but I learned that the 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.470
 Brazilian cheeses are so good or 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.470
 better than the imported ones will know 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.960
 Someone has to line up 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.730
 cheese 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.290
 I've talked now in any six already. 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.880
 years ago on the board in his first 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.590
 and then I saw that I had a 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.239
 very big story build started 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.070
 With Brazil, what are those more? 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.570
 Especially you have that moment like 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.219
 we have more than 100 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.590
 complaints now is not always that everyone who 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.360
 are available to a producer comes only 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.079
 A horse or car arrives and you are 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.360
 bringing horseback in the beginning is not 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.100
 simply come and bring an entire 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.840
 work to convince the producer to leave 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.719
 a little bit of the hillside farm 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.430
 go to the city and suddenly send for a 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.690
 mail with leaves the cheeses mines 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.250
 for example, we spend in each 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.100
 concierge do today we 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.630
 experience the student move then 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.150
 Serrano is a cheese that he is well 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.710
 he has buttery olive aroma is 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.439
 very interesting the house is getting 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.390
 hard because the region is cold but the 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.140
 always keeps butter cheese 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.140
 so cool 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.680
 delight has adopted this is a very 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.030
 Especially difficult to reach and one of the cars 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.650
 Brazilian history that we have 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.479
 beaten enough to be able to get 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.340
 get to the end this is the mountain range of the river 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.560
 south of josé dos serrana 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.759
 absent from your antonio and dona maria 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.950
 lopes do rio grande do sul 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.450
 another example is Dionysus, which is 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.159
 from São Paulo 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.050
 then this is a cheese that his bark 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.000
 will be washed with white wine 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.580
 then it will gain this crispness 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.800
 this natural white mold of the farm is 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.720
 one caste plus the navy and then this 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.649
 cheese in case you eat the dough more 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.140
 forest 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.270
 the crunchy shell then the box is a 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.130
 cheese is another mass that if you 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.690
 join the two a third then 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.119
 this is what appears, it is fundamental that 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:10.340
 food not with cheese dating in 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:12.620
 skin texture is well but win together 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.600
 at the time a small piece of the first pasta 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.850
 then the caste 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.040
 you feel quite at the edge of the shell 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.360
 after the mass and powerful is a cheese 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.160
 that we developed together with the 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.030
 producing a fifth inside 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.560
 Sao Paulo 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.140
 she had a frescal that she made with 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.670
 yogurt and after I won the loved 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.680
 that helps to form external is to do with 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.910
 that there is such mass and yet tried to 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.829
 various forms when she washed in the river 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.690
 white is not that marvel and today like this 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.489
 rarely we have the store was not 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.480
 it is already at this stage that the 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.640
 Europe is already long wanting 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.950
 already inventing the new ones and is 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.810
 Obvious, Brazil is not a university. 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.730
 much larger in any European country than 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.350
 people do not have so much history and 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.030
 people are now building the famous 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.950
 to finish the canasta and 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.420
 ended up entering a lot in the media as in 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.310
 2008 when it became equity 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.540
 national immaterial and ne 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.860
 after turning over equity now 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.079
 recently two years ago the indication 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.480
 geographically and politically the state of 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:03.799
 Minas Gerais behind the canasta including 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.640
 it was already a lot of film with the others 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.290
 credits 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.180
 today the other miners are understanding 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.920
 they are using channels with the model 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.690
 not 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.310
 mine another state of brazil also more 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.720
 he ended up earning a special plan or 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.400
 quality but also a bit of 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.959
 pretty good marketing I think I'm going 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.880
 change the lunch then the next time 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.890
 I was going to stay here, but besides 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.420
 cheese just totally invited a lot 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.010
 people come over here a fly to eat todinha 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.260
 having a wine when you want 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.030
 appear very good and national cheese right 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.630
 Who do you think you still have to pay? 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.410
 super expensive and imported cheese in 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.060
 interesting and come to know the 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.060
 that really goes supreme
