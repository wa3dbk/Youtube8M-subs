you other than no helmets s must be a

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.330 
you other than no helmets s must be a
lot<00:02:36.840> like<00:02:36.989> 20<00:02:37.290> maps<00:02:37.470> by<00:02:37.680> now<00:02:37.739> or<00:02:38.010> they<00:02:38.100> having

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
lot like 20 maps by now or they having

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.800 
lot like 20 maps by now or they having
it<00:02:38.430> they've<00:02:38.790> always<00:02:38.940> come<00:02:39.209> close<00:02:39.450> here<00:02:39.690> and

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
it they've always come close here and

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.539 
it they've always come close here and
there<00:02:39.930> but<00:02:39.959> then<00:02:40.170> they<00:02:40.290> skip<00:02:40.590> this<00:02:40.709> crushed

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
there but then they skip this crushed

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.970 
there but then they skip this crushed
shattered<00:02:42.180> every<00:02:42.540> single<00:02:42.780> time<00:02:42.959> so<00:02:43.200> until

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.020 
about that I think it's very much for
them<00:02:46.380> to<00:02:46.500> players<00:02:46.769> because<00:02:47.130> I<00:02:47.190> remember

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
oh they lost like 10 matches in a row we

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.420 
oh they lost like 10 matches in a row we
