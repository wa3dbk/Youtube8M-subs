is made of different various kind of

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.499 
is made of different various kind of
Veloz<00:00:13.549> there<00:00:14.549> are<00:00:14.610> various<00:00:14.820> qualities<00:00:15.299> in

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
Veloz there are various qualities in

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.490 
Veloz there are various qualities in
these<00:00:15.630> Veloz<00:00:16.340> and<00:00:17.340> each<00:00:17.580> villo<00:00:17.940> has<00:00:18.750> different

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
these Veloz and each villo has different

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.590 
these Veloz and each villo has different
grains<00:00:19.770> basically<00:00:20.490> so<00:00:20.699> when<00:00:21.270> you<00:00:21.359> look<00:00:21.510> at

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
grains basically so when you look at

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.750 
grains basically so when you look at
your<00:00:21.779> dad<00:00:21.990> you'll<00:00:22.320> notice<00:00:22.800> their<00:00:23.369> number<00:00:23.640> of

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
your dad you'll notice their number of

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.450 
your dad you'll notice their number of
different<00:00:24.060> grains<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.750> could<00:00:25.199> vary<00:00:25.529> from<00:00:25.830> you

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
different grains it could vary from you

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.660 
different grains it could vary from you
know<00:00:26.580> 5<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.420> 12<00:00:27.689> or<00:00:28.050> maybe<00:00:28.260> more<00:00:28.550> from<00:00:29.550> the

know 5 to 12 or maybe more from the

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.880 
know 5 to 12 or maybe more from the
villo<00:00:30.090> based<00:00:30.720> on<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.019> quality<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.710> villo

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
little bit of preparation on that so

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.360 
little bit of preparation on that so
first<00:00:39.629> thing<00:00:39.750> we<00:00:39.870> do<00:00:40.020> is<00:00:40.260> put<00:00:40.739> some<00:00:40.950> linseed

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370

first thing we do is put some linseed
oil<00:00:41.489> on<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.239> surface<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.840> bat<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:44.899> after

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
oil on the surface of the bat so after

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.160 
oil on the surface of the bat so after
and<00:00:46.170> then<00:00:46.289> we<00:00:46.500> let<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.010> soak<00:00:47.600> basically<00:00:48.600> for<00:00:48.899> a

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
and then we let it soak basically for a

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.220 
and then we let it soak basically for a

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
too much oil on that otherwise we'll get

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.709 
too much oil on that otherwise we'll get
the<00:00:54.600> villa<00:00:54.989> rotten<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:56.219> just<00:00:56.610> kind<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.180> put

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
like to knock in the process is called

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.410 
like to knock in the process is called
knocking<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.869> bat<00:01:07.080> first<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:07.890> do<00:01:08.390> with<00:01:09.390> a

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420

time<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.729> cover<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:19.680> edges<00:01:19.890> both<00:01:20.490> sides<00:01:20.820> of

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
time and cover the edges both sides of

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.499 
time and cover the edges both sides of
the<00:01:21.299> bat<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:22.350> after<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:23.060> you<00:01:24.060> want<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.299> come

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
the bat and after that you want to come

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.090 
the bat and after that you want to come
in<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.750> middle<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.170> bat<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.590> start

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
in the middle of the bat and start

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.649 
in the middle of the bat and start
knocking<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.790> bed<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.150> basically<00:01:27.450> what

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
knocking the bed so basically what

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.469 
knocking the bed so basically what
you're<00:01:27.810> doing<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:28.729> you're<00:01:29.729> chipping<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.299> bat

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
you're doing is you're chipping the bat

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.289 
you're doing is you're chipping the bat
basically<00:01:31.140> you're<00:01:31.560> compressing<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.490> bad<00:01:32.970> the

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
basically you're compressing the bad the

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.539 
basically you're compressing the bad the
villo<00:01:33.479> within<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.350> bed<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.770> when<00:01:35.130> the

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
villo within the bed so that when the

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.300 
villo within the bed so that when the
ball<00:01:35.759> strikes<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.329> bat<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.960> won't<00:01:37.530> chip<00:01:38.070> in

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
ball strikes the bat it won't chip in

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.999 
ball strikes the bat it won't chip in
and<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:39.060> process<00:01:39.540> again<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.200> like<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.590> said<00:01:40.650> it

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
and the process again it like I said it

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.370 
and the process again it like I said it
all<00:01:41.040> based<00:01:41.579> upon<00:01:41.820> different<00:01:42.720> kind<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:43.020> Veloz

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
all based upon different kind of Veloz

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.219 
all based upon different kind of Veloz
for<00:01:43.920> average<00:01:44.430> kind<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.790> villo<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.360> process

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
for average kind of villo the process

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.580 
for average kind of villo the process
may<00:01:46.439> take<00:01:46.939> basically<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:48.420> couple<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.110> weeks<00:01:49.350> you

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
may take basically a couple of weeks you

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.880 
may take basically a couple of weeks you
know<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:49.740> would<00:01:50.009> say<00:01:50.180> an<00:01:51.180> hour<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.840> day<00:01:51.990> for<00:01:52.860> a

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
know I would say an hour a day for a

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.039 
know I would say an hour a day for a
couple<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.189> weeks<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.579> know<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:54.060> again<00:01:54.720> when

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
couple of weeks you know and again when

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.679 
couple of weeks you know and again when
the<00:01:55.170> bat<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.560> all<00:01:55.770> ready<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.759> how<00:01:57.509> would<00:01:57.570> you

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
the bat is all ready and how would you

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.990 
the bat is all ready and how would you
know<00:01:57.960> is<00:01:58.170> when<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.070> when<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.369> bounce<00:01:59.670> a
