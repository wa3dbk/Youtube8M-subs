00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.459
 the whole game we had the series up 

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:11.750
 We could see the rest on 3 to 0 a 

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:14.570
 team the first time 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.760
 then with a lot of category he managed the 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.200
 ball whim he took brought 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:24.130
 he played first 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:28.019
 I create situations very easily 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.019
 and put a match 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.340
 in a series in favor that we knew 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.530
 us that we see 180 minutes and what 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.970
 had happened in the angels there was no 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.700
 been the reality is what had 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:43.740
 happened footballingly beyond 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:45.780
 of the good game of solo and 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.370
 and that he deserved better luck than the one 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.170
 had in the angels 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.240
 I feel that our players in our 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.240
 institution our leadership was betting 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:58.560
 this and today he got it and it's part of what 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:01.800
 that we are aspiring and that's why it does not have 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:04.710
 tranquility and faith in work in 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.600
 make decisions supported by your 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.500
 chairman of his board of directors of his 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.530
 sports director that does not 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.240
 it's not something I'm doing 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.080
 venturing but well analyzed with 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.410
 arguments 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.030
 with healthy internal sports discussions 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.880
 of our work and in which 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.850
 I appreciate today because no technician 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.000
 you can work the unsupported of your 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.580
 lens and today those who head this 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.940
 team 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:37.910
 have given support and confidence to 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.710
 proof of everything and that confidence is the 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:43.340
 I want to keep returning with results 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.530
 to them and all that Tijuana people 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.260
 that he dumps around his team that 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.840
 has got a reason 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.300
 social sports to identify and 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.390
 to tell the world here too 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:58.060
 we do good things positive things and 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.090
 I heard it starts to sound in many 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.230
 places but today we took a big step 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.860
 not only for entering the semifinals 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.920
 but because I feel that the team is 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.979
 consolidating 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.290
 what part of the things they asked me 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.630
 when it came it was that to tear down some 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.380
 myths and we're getting it 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.110
 internally and also with 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.480
 results of being able to win 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.160
 equipment that at some point is not 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.260
 I had been able to win 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.819
 and that we have the necessary strength to 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.470
 face it 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.750
 2 against which the results do not 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.130
 can accompany us in that illusion and 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.720
 give us the reason that if you can 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.900
 compete on two fronts and get 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.900
 results
