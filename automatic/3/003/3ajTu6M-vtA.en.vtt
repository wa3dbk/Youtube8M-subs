00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.570 

now<00:02:58.540> we're<00:02:59.530> going<00:02:59.650> to<00:02:59.710> let<00:02:59.860> the<00:02:59.950> pumps<00:03:00.370> just

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
now we're going to let the pumps just

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.750 
now we're going to let the pumps just
try<00:03:00.850> to<00:03:00.910> mix<00:03:01.270> this<00:03:01.510> soda<00:03:01.950> I've<00:03:02.950> read<00:03:03.190> to<00:03:03.580> leave

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
try to mix this soda I've read to leave

for 24 hours the heaters in there both
the<00:03:07.870> pumps<00:03:08.140> are<00:03:08.260> mixing<00:03:08.500> up<00:03:08.650> so<00:03:08.950> we<00:03:09.640> should

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
the pumps are mixing up so we should

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.190 
the pumps are mixing up so we should
just<00:03:09.880> leave<00:03:10.210> it<00:03:10.270> for<00:03:10.450> a<00:03:10.630> while

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
just leave it for a while

just leave it for a while
temperature<00:03:11.830> is<00:03:11.890> good<00:03:12.570> and<00:03:13.570> we'll<00:03:13.840> see<00:03:14.050> what

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
temperature is good and we'll see what

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.140 
temperature is good and we'll see what
happens<00:03:14.650> after<00:03:14.830> a<00:03:14.980> little<00:03:15.130> bit<00:03:15.250> okay<00:03:16.000> it's

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
happens after a little bit okay it's

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.660 
happens after a little bit okay it's
been<00:03:16.270> about<00:03:16.300> three<00:03:16.780> hours<00:03:16.960> I<00:03:17.470> have<00:03:18.220> my<00:03:18.370> salt

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
been about three hours I have my salt

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.270 
been about three hours I have my salt
water<00:03:18.880> in<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:19.180> tub<00:03:19.390> they're<00:03:20.280> actually

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
water in the tub they're actually

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.670 
water in the tub they're actually
connected<00:03:21.730> my<00:03:22.180> wave<00:03:22.840> maker<00:03:24.660> to<00:03:25.660> the<00:03:26.080> two<00:03:26.290> pumps

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
connected my wave maker to the two pumps

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.410 
connected my wave maker to the two pumps
in<00:03:26.830> there<00:03:26.980> and<00:03:27.190> get<00:03:27.310> a<00:03:27.340> better<00:03:27.520> current

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
in there and get a better current

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.950 
in there and get a better current
flowing<00:03:28.690> and<00:03:28.990> I<00:03:30.180> went<00:03:31.180> out<00:03:31.300> and<00:03:31.450> bought<00:03:31.510> a

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:31.960 
flowing and I went out and bought a

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.340 
flowing and I went out and bought a
hydrometer<00:03:32.500> I<00:03:33.570> did<00:03:34.570> order<00:03:34.780> a<00:03:34.900> refractometer

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
hydrometer I did order a refractometer

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.350 
hydrometer I did order a refractometer
and<00:03:36.160> I<00:03:36.340> will<00:03:36.550> use<00:03:36.760> that<00:03:38.580> but<00:03:39.580> I<00:03:39.610> went<00:03:39.940> ahead<00:03:40.060> and

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
and I will use that but I went ahead and

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.340 
and I will use that but I went ahead and
this<00:03:40.900> was<00:03:41.050> going<00:03:41.170> like<00:03:41.350> 11<00:03:41.740> bucks<00:03:41.890> so<00:03:42.700> I<00:03:43.140> put<00:03:44.140> my

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
this was going like 11 bucks so I put my

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.090 
this was going like 11 bucks so I put my
salt<00:03:44.860> water<00:03:45.040> in<00:03:45.190> there<00:03:45.370> and<00:03:45.610> it's<00:03:46.240> right<00:03:46.480> on

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
salt water in there and it's right on

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.190 
salt water in there and it's right on
right<00:03:48.100> now<00:03:48.340> one<00:03:49.000> point<00:03:49.420> between<00:03:49.630> one<00:03:49.960> point

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
right now one point between one point

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.850 
right now one point between one point
zero<00:03:50.350> to<00:03:50.680> four<00:03:50.920> and<00:03:51.040> one<00:03:51.160> point<00:03:51.430> zero<00:03:51.490> to<00:03:51.790> five

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
zero to four and one point zero to five

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:59.790 
zero to four and one point zero to five
secondly<00:03:53.860> the<00:03:54.750> buoyancy<00:03:55.750> of<00:03:55.960> the<00:03:56.080> water<00:03:58.800> zero

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
secondly the buoyancy of the water zero

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.230 
secondly the buoyancy of the water zero
of<00:04:00.130> course<00:04:00.370> to<00:04:00.970> be<00:04:01.150> tap<00:04:01.480> water<00:04:01.920> and<00:04:02.940> the<00:04:03.940> reason

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.240 
of course to be tap water and the reason

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.150 
of course to be tap water and the reason
I<00:04:04.330> have<00:04:04.480> the<00:04:04.600> water<00:04:04.810> in<00:04:05.020> here<00:04:05.230> it<00:04:05.470> said<00:04:05.680> before

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
I have the water in here it said before

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.390 
I have the water in here it said before
you<00:04:06.340> actually<00:04:06.790> use<00:04:07.000> it<00:04:07.320> to<00:04:08.320> put<00:04:08.920> salt<00:04:09.220> sea

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
you actually use it to put salt sea

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.090 
you actually use it to put salt sea
water<00:04:09.610> in<00:04:09.910> it<00:04:10.060> and<00:04:10.240> set<00:04:10.750> it<00:04:10.870> for<00:04:11.230> 24<00:04:11.740> hours

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
water in it and set it for 24 hours

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.500 
water in it and set it for 24 hours
season<00:04:12.610> the<00:04:12.700> needle<00:04:13.000> so<00:04:13.120> that's<00:04:13.300> what<00:04:13.420> I'm

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
season the needle so that's what I'm

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:14.899 
season the needle so that's what I'm
doing

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:14.909 
doing

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:19.860 
doing
tomorrow<00:04:15.909> when<00:04:16.090> I<00:04:16.180> pick<00:04:16.419> up<00:04:18.690> that's<00:04:19.690> what

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
tomorrow when I pick up that's what

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.990 
tomorrow when I pick up that's what
we'll<00:04:19.989> do<00:04:20.199> we'll<00:04:20.829> test<00:04:21.130> the<00:04:21.370> water<00:04:21.579> we'll<00:04:21.880> look

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
we'll do we'll test the water we'll look

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.400 
we'll do we'll test the water we'll look
at<00:04:22.150> the<00:04:22.240> water<00:04:22.419> the<00:04:22.570> water<00:04:22.720> should<00:04:22.840> be<00:04:23.139> much

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
at the water the water should be much

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.150 
at the water the water should be much
clearer<00:04:24.630> temperature<00:04:25.630> should<00:04:25.780> be<00:04:25.870> right<00:04:26.080> on

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
clearer temperature should be right on

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.930 
clearer temperature should be right on
and<00:04:27.479> we'll<00:04:28.479> take<00:04:28.660> a<00:04:28.690> good<00:04:28.960> reading<00:04:29.169> with<00:04:29.440> the

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
and we'll take a good reading with the

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.940 
and we'll take a good reading with the
hydrometer
