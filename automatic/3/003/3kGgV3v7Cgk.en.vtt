00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:22.579
 television is a novelty for a 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.669
 talent program rarely seen in 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:28.009
 television a group of young people with the 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:31.369
 magic of light and with the magic of its 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:34.850
 hands managed to surprise us in the north 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:39.550

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.550
 wonderful how it is presented hand live 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.490
 why 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.200

 3 and congratulations 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.810
 we have always had a profile 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:24.740
 low with what we do so we have been 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:27.530
 said this and yet in our 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.659
 lives have changed obviously we do not know 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.970
 that here perhaps they change much more they have 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.940
 open the doors to many places 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:38.080
 but if we are very expectant and 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.080
 it really is like that 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.770
 in Trujillo is a place where it is supported 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.929

 continue to be promoted because we know 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:50.799
