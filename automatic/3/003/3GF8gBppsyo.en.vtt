00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
weight not that much though let's have a

weight not that much though let's have a
look<00:00:37.859> at<00:00:37.949> it

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
look at it

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.360 
look at it
first<00:00:38.609> up<00:00:38.789> on<00:00:39.059> each<00:00:39.329> end<00:00:39.569> there<00:00:39.749> is<00:00:39.839> a

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
first up on each end there is a

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.790 
first up on each end there is a
four-foot<00:00:41.370> Whoopie<00:00:41.729> sling<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.620> didn't<00:00:43.620> go<00:00:43.769> with

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
four-foot Whoopie sling I didn't go with

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.799 
four-foot Whoopie sling I didn't go with
anything<00:00:44.550> longer<00:00:45.030> because<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.479> figured<00:00:45.780> that

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
anything longer because I figured that

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.919 
anything longer because I figured that
the<00:00:46.109> line<00:00:46.559> right<00:00:46.800> here<00:00:46.979> and<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.249> triangles

00:00:47.919 --> 00:00:47.929 
the line right here and the triangles

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:50.090 
the line right here and the triangles
would<00:00:48.929> give<00:00:49.139> you<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.289> 40<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.679> little<00:00:49.920> bit<00:00:50.010> of

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
would give you a 40 a little bit of

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.099 
would give you a 40 a little bit of
length<00:00:50.389> so<00:00:51.389> I<00:00:51.420> can<00:00:51.569> go<00:00:51.659> with<00:00:51.749> a<00:00:51.839> little<00:00:51.929> bit

00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:52.109 
length so I can go with a little bit

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:56.959 
length so I can go with a little bit
shorter<00:00:52.379> sling<00:00:53.389> on<00:00:54.389> the<00:00:54.600> fixed<00:00:54.899> die<00:00:55.049> I<00:00:55.850> put<00:00:56.850> in

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
shorter sling on the fixed die I put in

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.910 
shorter sling on the fixed die I put in
a<00:00:57.059> rope<00:00:57.269> thimble<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.929> attach<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.469> legs<00:00:58.679> to

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
a rope thimble to attach the legs to

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.779 
a rope thimble to attach the legs to
this<00:00:59.549> should<00:00:59.789> help<00:00:59.969> keep<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:01.489> bend<00:01:02.489> the

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
this should help keep the bend the

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.700 
this should help keep the bend the
radiuses<00:01:03.359> from<00:01:03.690> getting<00:01:03.989> too<00:01:04.170> tight<00:01:04.409> on<00:01:04.440> the

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
radiuses from getting too tight on the

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.109 
radiuses from getting too tight on the
cords<00:01:05.010> rather<00:01:05.250> than<00:01:05.400> just<00:01:05.519> having<00:01:05.670> court<00:01:06.000> on

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
cords rather than just having court on

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.900 
cords rather than just having court on
cord<00:01:06.420> here<00:01:06.690> I<00:01:07.190> cut<00:01:08.190> the<00:01:08.280> ends<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.670> spreader

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:08.910 
cord here I cut the ends of the spreader

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.310 
cord here I cut the ends of the spreader
bar<00:01:09.090> thought<00:01:09.300> they<00:01:09.450> had<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.690> notches<00:01:09.900> in<00:01:10.110> them

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
bar thought they had the notches in them

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.990 
bar thought they had the notches in them
and<00:01:10.500> put<00:01:11.340> these<00:01:11.690> end<00:01:12.690> pieces<00:01:12.990> in<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.760> also

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
and put these end pieces in and I also

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.210 
and put these end pieces in and I also
shot<00:01:15.360> corded<00:01:15.810> them<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.560> might<00:01:16.740> be<00:01:16.860> adding<00:01:17.160> in

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
shot corded them that might be adding in

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.280 
shot corded them that might be adding in
my<00:01:17.310> little<00:01:17.670> bit<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:17.820> my<00:01:17.940> weight<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.390> also<00:01:18.960> think

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
my little bit of my weight I also think

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.610 
my little bit of my weight I also think
these<00:01:19.410> end<00:01:19.650> pieces<00:01:19.830> are<00:01:20.820> taking<00:01:21.620> replacing

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 
these end pieces are taking replacing

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:23.690 
these end pieces are taking replacing
some<00:01:22.800> of<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.920> weight<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.220> all<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.490> rings

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
some of the weight that all the rings

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.310 
some of the weight that all the rings
took<00:01:24.000> so<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.270> think<00:01:24.450> that<00:01:24.720> might<00:01:24.870> be<00:01:24.990> one<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.140> my

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
took so I think that might be one of my

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.080 
took so I think that might be one of my
weight<00:01:25.530> saving<00:01:25.950> problems

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
weight saving problems

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.920 
weight saving problems
I<00:01:27.120> didn't<00:01:27.960> shorten<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.010> bars<00:01:29.570> any<00:01:30.570> more<00:01:30.780> than

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
I didn't shorten the bars any more than

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.780 
I didn't shorten the bars any more than
I<00:01:31.050> think<00:01:31.110> half-inch<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:32.010> think<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.370> took<00:01:32.430> three

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
I think half-inch I think I took three

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.310 
I think half-inch I think I took three
inches<00:01:33.030> off<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.240> bars<00:01:33.600> total<00:01:33.990> inch<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.290> a

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
inches off the bars total inch and a

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.160 
inches off the bars total inch and a
half<00:01:34.350> on<00:01:35.130> either<00:01:35.400> end<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.910> really<00:01:36.720> only<00:01:36.870> 1/2

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
half on either end I really only 1/2

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.360 
half on either end I really only 1/2
inch<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:37.590> makes<00:01:37.800> a<00:01:37.890> difference<00:01:38.190> because

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 
inch of that makes a difference because

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.240 
inch of that makes a difference because
it<00:01:38.640> into<00:01:38.910> that<00:01:39.000> was<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.420> notched<00:01:39.630> ends<00:01:40.250> which

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
it into that was the notched ends which

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.320 
it into that was the notched ends which
wouldn't<00:01:41.520> make<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.700> difference<00:01:41.850> in<00:01:42.210> the

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
wouldn't make a difference in the

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.060 
wouldn't make a difference in the

are<00:01:54.630> happy<00:01:54.870> with<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.290> think<00:01:55.470> I'm<00:01:55.560> gonna<00:01:55.710> go

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
are happy with it I think I'm gonna go

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.610 
are happy with it I think I'm gonna go
with<00:01:56.690> one<00:01:57.690> that<00:01:57.810> drapes<00:01:58.050> over<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.290> entire

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
with one that drapes over the entire

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.899 
with one that drapes over the entire
hammock<00:01:59.479> and<00:02:00.560> originally<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:01.590> had<00:02:01.909> rope

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
hammock and originally I had rope

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.810 
hammock and originally I had rope
thimbles<00:02:03.330> at<00:02:03.870> these<00:02:04.140> connections<00:02:04.650> too<00:02:04.860> but

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
thimbles at these connections too but

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.259 
thimbles at these connections too but
you<00:02:05.909> can<00:02:06.030> see<00:02:06.240> this<00:02:06.360> Bend<00:02:06.720> right<00:02:07.290> here<00:02:08.269> that

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.269 
you can see this Bend right here that

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:11.750 
you can see this Bend right here that
that<00:02:10.140> was<00:02:10.319> digging<00:02:11.129> into<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.459> end<00:02:11.609> of<00:02:11.670> the

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
that was digging into the end of the

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.330 
that was digging into the end of the
rope<00:02:11.939> thimble<00:02:12.329> so<00:02:13.290> I<00:02:13.319> think<00:02:13.439> eliminating

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
rope thimble so I think eliminating

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.000 
rope thimble so I think eliminating
thimbles<00:02:14.790> there<00:02:15.030> will<00:02:15.900> be<00:02:15.930> okay

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
thimbles there will be okay

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.759 
thimbles there will be okay
because<00:02:17.159> the<00:02:17.689> radius<00:02:18.689> of<00:02:18.870> this<00:02:18.989> bar<00:02:19.260> end<00:02:19.530> as

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
because the radius of this bar end as

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.509 
because the radius of this bar end as
you<00:02:20.519> lay<00:02:20.730> in<00:02:20.879> it<00:02:21.000> in<00:02:21.239> the<00:02:22.189> webbing<00:02:23.189> and<00:02:23.459> the

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
you lay in it in the webbing and the

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.920 
you lay in it in the webbing and the
loop<00:02:23.700> pull<00:02:23.939> up<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.209> that<00:02:24.239> this<00:02:24.840> radius<00:02:25.290> on<00:02:25.680> this

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
loop pull up to that this radius on this

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.509 
loop pull up to that this radius on this
end<00:02:27.930> right<00:02:28.049> here<00:02:28.349> will<00:02:28.680> keep<00:02:28.860> their<00:02:29.099> radius

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
end right here will keep their radius

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.970 
end right here will keep their radius
and<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.819> rope<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:30.689> the<00:02:31.409> webbing<00:02:31.680> here<00:02:31.769> from

and the rope and the webbing here from

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.780 
and the rope and the webbing here from

getting too tight you also do have the

getting too tight you also do have the

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
ability to add a ridgeline to this if

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:38.330 
ability to add a ridgeline to this if
you<00:02:37.470> wanted<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.769> hang<00:02:37.860> a<00:02:37.920> different<00:02:38.220> type<00:02:38.310> of

end<00:02:41.610> hammock<00:02:41.879> you<00:02:42.120> can<00:02:42.239> just<00:02:42.420> go<00:02:42.540> from<00:02:42.739> the

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
end hammock you can just go from the

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.729 
end hammock you can just go from the
rope<00:02:44.459> thimble<00:02:44.790> on<00:02:44.849> one<00:02:45.090> end<00:02:45.239> to<00:02:45.299> the<00:02:45.450> other<00:02:45.739> go

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
rope thimble on one end to the other go

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:47.929 
rope thimble on one end to the other go
down<00:02:46.950> to<00:02:47.069> the<00:02:47.159> other<00:02:47.250> end<00:02:47.459> with<00:02:47.579> it<00:02:47.700> you<00:02:47.790> can

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:47.939 
down to the other end with it you can

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:50.599 
down to the other end with it you can
use<00:02:48.060> an<00:02:48.180> adjustable<00:02:48.540> or<00:02:48.810> fixed<00:02:49.609> adjustable

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
use an adjustable or fixed adjustable

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:51.619 
use an adjustable or fixed adjustable
will<00:02:50.700> probably<00:02:50.940> be<00:02:51.000> better<00:02:51.150> for<00:02:51.269> the<00:02:51.480> bridge

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
will probably be better for the bridge

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:54.410 
will probably be better for the bridge
hammock<00:02:52.760> but<00:02:53.760> I<00:02:53.819> guess<00:02:54.030> you<00:02:54.150> could<00:02:54.269> use<00:02:54.390> a

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
hammock but I guess you could use a

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.220 
hammock but I guess you could use a
fixed<00:02:54.750> one<00:02:54.840> too<00:02:55.340> and<00:02:56.340> then<00:02:56.639> the<00:02:57.239> 4-foot<00:02:57.989> sling

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
fixed one too and then the 4-foot sling

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.610 
fixed one too and then the 4-foot sling
on<00:02:58.349> the<00:02:58.440> other<00:02:58.560> end<00:02:59.239> like<00:03:00.239> I<00:03:00.269> say<00:03:00.510> my<00:03:01.409> weight

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
on the other end like I say my weight

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.990 
on the other end like I say my weight
came<00:03:01.829> out<00:03:01.980> to<00:03:02.099> 36.4<00:03:03.030> for<00:03:03.239> the<00:03:03.299> entire<00:03:03.540> system

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
came out to 36.4 for the entire system

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.569 
came out to 36.4 for the entire system
36.4<00:03:06.000> ounces<00:03:06.359> so<00:03:06.810> I'm<00:03:06.930> not<00:03:07.049> sure<00:03:07.109> if<00:03:07.579> if

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
36.4 ounces so I'm not sure if if

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:10.129 
36.4 ounces so I'm not sure if if
there's<00:03:08.819> really<00:03:08.970> just<00:03:09.090> not<00:03:09.420> that<00:03:09.750> much<00:03:09.930> of<00:03:10.079> a

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:10.139 
there's really just not that much of a

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:13.490 
there's really just not that much of a
weight<00:03:10.319> savings<00:03:10.709> there<00:03:10.970> or<00:03:11.970> if<00:03:12.810> my<00:03:13.049> scales<00:03:13.290> off

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
weight savings there or if my scales off

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.759 
weight savings there or if my scales off
or<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.220> jacks<00:03:14.489> base<00:03:14.760> weight<00:03:15.000> is<00:03:15.540> off<00:03:15.840> but

or the jacks base weight is off but

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.020 
or the jacks base weight is off but
