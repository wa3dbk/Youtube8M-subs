00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.490
 hey people i am the professor and 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.259
 I'm glad that we will be back 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.330
 have turned on here on our 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.010
 channel of the editorial holdings today 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.820
 a small but fine video about so 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.980
 a wardrobe built and what the 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.389
 The special feature of this is so that will be yes 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.859
 Let's open or see it here 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.600
 three armor stand in it 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:24.180
 and of course we can 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:26.490
 In april things are so clean 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.390
 the blue is not bad 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.250
 so we can get three armor here 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.739
 or three clothing span unmixed 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.590
 and how it works as you are here exactly three 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.000
 I'll show you rows now 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.989
 in order to build the whole we need three 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.730
 armor stand 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.890
 there we need a sticky one 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.190
 piston I believe it even goes one 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.340
 normal piston then we need one 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.219
 Wooden fence or any sound does not matter 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.610
 which then we need a lever 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.289
 we need different doors i 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.230
 used quite like iron doors for the 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.470
 cabinet sides and for the barrier 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.500
 front 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.510
 any wooden doors the a rat to 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.100
 like 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.090
 yes, because the iron doors you can 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.380
 do not press 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:16.720
 then they stay firmly as turn and the 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.720
 whole cabinet breuer still up somewhere 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.880
 such a blanket and we can do that 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.570
 trap doors wood or any drones 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.950
 use 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:29.800
 that does not really matter to start with 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.940
 the armor stands to be placed 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.869
 placed 2 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:38.369
 He was then supposed to be there 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.900
 place here with a block distance 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.320
 this sticky butt 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.720
 it can also be normal piston 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:50.470
 and in front of the piston is the fence 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:53.470
 placed to trigger the piston 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:56.200
 Let's put our lever and the 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.850
 then we have to go out then this one 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.430
 first armor stand so in the second 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.800
 Armor put in and the 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.460
 are closer together 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:09.340
 Well, now we put the lever back 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:12.790
 make the fence and place here 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:16.660
 arming in front of the piston 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:19.269
 steiner and then we come to solve it 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.910
 go back and let it go back 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:25.540
 We now have three of these 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.590
 armor stand in principle here on two 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.530
 fields distributed 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.060
 there we can break down the piston and 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.890
 Now we are going to build the cabinet 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.550
 let's put it off 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:41.239
 These iron doors each on the outside 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:43.250
 leaves and then only more 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.080
 wooden door there please with the left door 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:51.620
 beginning and then the right with that 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:52.970
 whole a double door is coming now 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.700
 and only sees more 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.319
 the top of the cabinet so if you are 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.500
 have a minimalist closet 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:02.959
 you want to use such here 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.519
 You can also make wood ornaments 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:09.079
 something big or touring 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:11.019
 I have the idea of ​​the buddy playroom 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:14.090
 take a look at those on the canal 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.560
 And yes, that's the cupboard too 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.239
 I hope you have the little one 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.790
 video because it is nothing special 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.680
 but we can do ours here now 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.629
 clothes on it and on three 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.340
 armor stand that maybe completely 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:27.829
 interesting because you do not need dreams 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.510
 where you have the clothes in there so in the 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.940
 I have survival mode here 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.109
 Diamond armor travel armor and one 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.630
 couple of leather things hanging 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:37.609
 depending on what I need right now 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.109
 I just let it out, I hope you guys 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:42.340
 we liked the little video we see 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:42.340
 See you again next time
