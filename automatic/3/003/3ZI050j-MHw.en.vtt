00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:05.070
 This is a demonstration video for the application of keratin treatment 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.949
 but which conditions and revitalizes the hair 

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:12.169
 restoring its natural and healthy state 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.519
 in step number one during its preparation 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:33.170
 a frizz the hair with warm water 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.230
 and apply the one that was Tim Frost Purifying Shampoo 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.270
 it is not necessary to rub the scalp 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.129
 rinse with warm water 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:47.299
 and repeat two or three times until the hair is completely clean 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.370
 for virgin hair you should let shampoo act for longer 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.370
 let it stand in 3 5 to 10 minutes 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.730
 ilave then up to three times 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.970
 this will allow to open the hair cuticle 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.930
 Preparing to receive dekker treatment to thing from 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.270
 I did not use conditioning 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.670
 I know that deep the hair with the dryer 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.320
 p for the application of the treatment divide the hair into sections 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.240
 put the keratin in a container 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.469
 from one to two ounces depending on the exchange rate 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.710
 always use gloves apply keratin pro in each section 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.920
 starting from the nape of the neck to one centimeter of the scalp 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.540
 continue to apply the keratin along the hair 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.200
 with the help of a brush or a comb 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.200
 until covering it totally 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.729
 the cuticle formed by the cells composed of keratin 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.249
 is responsible for protecting the inside of the hair 

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:16.400
 while influencing the brightness and color of it 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:21.489
 There are several factors that affect the good quality of hair 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.079
 the mechanical treatments man city called 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:29.029
 environmental conditions such as drive 

00:02:29.029 --> 00:02:31.129
 cause their deterioration 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.700
 and as a fundamental factor of hair deterioration 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.700
 is the work of chemists like the mess 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.489
 that cause the cuticle to swell isead 

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:45.520
 something that with the continuous use of chemical products 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.029
 modifies hair structure 

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:50.999
 turning it into this fragile disk 

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:51.999
 orozco 

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:58.760
 and even crisp camps 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:02.759
 when you have finished applying the entire product 

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:07.419
 p in the hair for five minutes to ensure activation 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.080
 and correctly distribute the one that was tim frost all over the hair 

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:29.969
 it will remain inkwell 

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:32.989
 It is recommended for all hair types 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:37.730
 including those hair chemically treated colorados 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.579
 finite with permanent 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:44.359
 keratin pro is ideal for mistreated hair 

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:47.009
 It has a nice smell 

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:49.159
 repair and condition 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:51.339
 protects damaged hair 

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:53.029
 reduce the volume 

00:03:53.029 --> 00:03:56.119
 removes the static frieze of the hair 

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:58.469
 gives an incredible shine 

00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:01.319
 smile and revitalize 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:02.500
 keratin pro 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.900
 it's excellent 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.900
 for all hair types 

00:04:11.029 --> 00:04:14.539
 let rest that was fifth for 15 minutes 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:22.009
 when it comes to dark hair those very curly knew virgin hair leave 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:24.249
 rest for longer 

00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:29.019
 close again lightly the hair with the dryer to remove moisture 

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:34.229
 but if what you are looking for is to recover the shine of your hair improve your 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:38.259
 appearance and does not want to straighten the hair or the and mine its volume 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.150
 I left the treatment to rest for less time 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.130
 five or ten minutes 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.130
 depending on the result you want to achieve 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.230
 for the sealed ironing of keratin 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.710
 start passing the pottery plant 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.729
 8 to 10 times for each strand 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:09.779
 depending on the type of hair, the temperature of the iron should be between 430 

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:12.779
 and 450 degrees it seems 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.830
 keratin but restores the hair and protects it 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.509
 list and eliminate frizz 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:25.729
 brick and softness 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:28.729
 and it makes the hairstyle much easier 

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:34.509
 Guaranteed for three months or more depending on the type of hair 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:35.900
 external factors 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.180
 and your care 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.310
 I opted 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:47.989

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:50.490

 composed of a shampoo and a conditioner does not contain sulphates 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:00.990
 but the final one and it makes them specially formulated for not 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.219
 interfere with the treatment 

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:06.219
 and get the best results 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.050
 it is recommended to use generating group 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:21.239
