00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.680
 famous exchange of the gods of the cross and therefore 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.980

 colors you had chosen here it is here and there 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.019
 I show the first application 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.029
 so no review is really one 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.740
 first application of the products of 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.750
 some of these products 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.800
 I tried mineral powder today 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:43.379
 this mineral bottom we say sun in 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:47.219
 eyes I put myself on these two suns 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:51.120
 good these two pencils the page and the 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.430
 brawn and then I'm afraid tomà en passant not 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.710
 of passage then I removed it I removed it 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.260
 this gossip the claque 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.570
 all.re this lipsticks know liquid that 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.640
 however it is of such an intense color wuxi è 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.049
 that I tried it just to do it for you 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.119
 see what immediately removed because not 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.159
 I could make breakfast to be 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.270
 honest nothing this is the result 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:16.439
 I hear our noises together with the 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.150
 drawer yesterday to check 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.580
 in the meantime to this result vi 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.950
 I leave the application in the products on 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.240
 foundation it seems to me initially not me 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.950
 like it can instead gave me a 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.540
 nice result maybe this even m 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.820
 the company necklace and just say hello 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:37.409
 let me know what you think about fashion 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:42.840
 the mineral bottom then has its beauty 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:44.850
 anti casino closures and let's get out 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.079
 a little in the carpet 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.259
 I have no idea what color is like 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.189
 let's just give it a try first 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.790
 try together 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:59.159
 here it is I take my kabuki snow 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:02.630
 makeup little jelly and via menotti 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.630
 the mirror maybe 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.630
 and continues until I get a 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:17.370
 satisfactory result for now 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:19.380
 I leave so it seems to me maybe a 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.000
 little bit clear now let's go to 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.720
 see when you can put some 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.770
 earth if the effect will be nice or if it is 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.590
 we must keep for the next 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.840
 winter with the cacco pencil reads say 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.910
 tris I'm going to outline a little bit at 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.220
 eyebrows are there because it has it 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.220
 reach passes over the pencil 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:47.190
 also the product after cleaning it for 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:50.130
 well tell me blau of benefits so from 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:56.720
 intensify some more color and 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:56.720
 also fix the eyebrows 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:11.720
 in this way where at this point 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:16.320
 let's move on to eye makeup 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:19.650
 I would say that in the cell the two pencils of 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.930
 goch the champagne and brown then 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:26.459
 let's start by removing the plastic 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:28.830
 it's just the new new new beginnings 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.620
 controlled by champagne and it's called 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.720
 let's see if a name May 2 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:38.820
 here it is so it's good there is one 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:41.459
 champagne and I'm going to hang out here 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.800
 on the eyebrow arch 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:47.550
 I meant eyelid and it was n't 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:51.720
 eyebrows at this point this is 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:54.290
 the average effect I have to say for it 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.269
 less with this color is not that we notice 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:00.080
 who knows how much from a beautiful luminescence 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:08.820
 in short this yes I am going to open the 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:11.910
 brown which is called brawn brawn instead 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.560
 the brown while I open it I tell you that 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.060
 I say it is a bit like it was one 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.480
 pencil so I want to trace one 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.250
 line below and here attached to the lashes 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.770
 this I must say that leaves me more 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:26.190
 satisfactions because a color that 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.020
 at least you notice it is very soft squaw 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:32.960
 made a mess is very soft and 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:35.610
 therefore two colors can be overlapped and 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.380
 bili fades indeed also going to try to 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.990
 blend the brown with a small brush 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:43.139
 this I must say that I like this 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.820
 brown I go now to put on the mascara 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:48.270
 it is the love extreme that was a bit dry 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:51.720
 but I did it resurrect thanks to some 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.550
 of debt for the lenses an hour at this 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.830
 the hockey effect finished 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.450
 I like them I'm going to put some 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:01.270
 bronze 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:07.509
 kiko this is the good parent browser 101 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:07.509
 so I go to give some color let's say 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:16.490
 I know it because it seemed like a foundation 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:18.349
 has therefore somewhat lightened therefore 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.349
 skouris with po because I like to have 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:23.180
 the color effect then this background 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:25.580
 minutes pass and it seems to me to be more 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.960
 nice because it didn't convince me 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.319
 initially there or the truth me 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.280
 it seemed too dusty instead vi 

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:34.580
 it seems 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:38.180
 maybe in his invents that i pass 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:40.099
 minutes you are conforming on the skin 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.889
 possible that the mineral funds do 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:46.759
 I don't know this thing already 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:48.830
 I put some blush wine or something 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:50.270
 to make handicap 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.580
 yesterday I gave I started putting in 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.919
 placed a whole series of tricks that 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.949
 I was around and these are those 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:06:03.860
 still to settle let's say put 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:05.539
 a little bit he wants the now 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.210
 trick would be over I'll show you 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:12.349
 why the product they gave me 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:15.199
 da gauche is a lipstick that 

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:19.009
 absolutely not for daytime because vi 

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:31.580
 I show the color I open it and a goal 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:32.840
 plucks to open them first no no help 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:37.370
 oh well tell me something in 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:38.560
 Meanwhile manuel arrives let's go 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.969
 Breakfast 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:44.259
 in the afternoon I see my mother and mine 

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:44.259
 papino my sisters 

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:48.770
 here it is the color so I could 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:51.800
 even put it on now but to go 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:54.490
 to have breakfast here in my area I don't 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.490
 looks like it 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:01.720
 better not, and I only put it for 

00:06:59.229 --> 00:07:06.520
 let you see it because it never turns around 

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:11.220
 so at 10 am I feel like a 

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:16.810
 clown and evening is obviously the evening 

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:19.150
 but I wanted to show the color to tell you 

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:21.159
 which has a very good fragrance is made 

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:22.720
 so it's too cute because it looks like the 

00:07:21.159 --> 00:07:24.849
 small bottle of a nail polish instead then the 

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:27.580
 lipstick anyway now too apple tree 

00:07:24.849 --> 00:07:30.909
 immediately we go instead to 

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:34.300
 replace with a gloss of ny ex this 

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:43.719
 this here a little more sober a bit from 

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:46.780
 day we say a little pink 

00:07:43.719 --> 00:07:52.030
 sparkling no name is not very good 

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:54.099
 for the day and wants so this is it 

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:57.520
 one this is one of the first attempts 

00:07:54.099 --> 00:08:00.669
 we say there are ghosh tricks 

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:02.500
 still the cream that is still closed 

00:08:00.669 --> 00:08:05.500
 I haven't opened it yet and this 

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:07.120
 product illuminating to the role this 

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:09.759
 which must be a nice little product 

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:13.840
 i will try it in the next mornings e 

00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:17.440

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:19.650
 everything is made up to the shins and weekend 

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.650
 Hello
