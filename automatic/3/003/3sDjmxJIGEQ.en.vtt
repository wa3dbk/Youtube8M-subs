really<00:00:55.650> rich<00:00:55.860> time<00:00:56.130> period<00:00:56.490> so<00:00:56.640> we<00:00:56.760> were<00:00:56.850> able

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
really rich time period so we were able

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.670 
really rich time period so we were able
to<00:00:57.150> include<00:00:57.540> a<00:00:57.780> lot<00:00:58.110> of<00:00:58.140> different<00:00:58.500> characters

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.080 
and a lot of different events that fan

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.990 
and a lot of different events that fan
should<00:01:01.110> know<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:01.860> we<00:01:02.370> were<00:01:02.430> also<00:01:02.610> able<00:01:02.760> to

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
should know so we were also able to

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.479 
should know so we were also able to
create<00:01:03.330> new<00:01:03.900> places<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.439> new<00:01:04.799> characters

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
create new places and new characters

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.120 
create new places and new characters

all these elements and put them together

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.990 
all these elements and put them together
to<00:01:28.650> create<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.979> brand<00:01:29.220> new<00:01:29.310> Star<00:01:29.580> Wars<00:01:29.610> story

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
but really be able to bridge the gap

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.200 
but really be able to bridge the gap
between<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:32.010> two<00:01:32.159> trilogies<00:01:32.430> in<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.030> same

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
between the two trilogies in the same

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.120 
between the two trilogies in the same
time<00:01:33.420> from<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.260> outset<00:01:34.590> we<00:01:34.830> knew<00:01:34.950> we<00:01:35.100> wanted

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
time from the outset we knew we wanted

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.730 
time from the outset we knew we wanted
to<00:01:35.370> reimagine<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.360> force<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:37.020> really<00:01:37.470> kind

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
to reimagine the force and really kind

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.410 
to reimagine the force and really kind
of<00:01:37.770> reinvent<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.490> in<00:01:38.580> many<00:01:38.729> ways<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.210> we<00:01:39.270> came

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
of reinvent it in many ways and we came

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.820 
of reinvent it in many ways and we came
up<00:01:39.479> with<00:01:39.720> this<00:01:39.810> idea<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.409> force<00:01:40.650> unleashed

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
up with this idea of the force unleashed

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.039 
up with this idea of the force unleashed
this<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.640> fourth<00:01:41.880> over<00:01:42.120> the<00:01:42.479> top<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.900> out

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
this is the fourth over the top and out

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.380 
this is the fourth over the top and out
of<00:01:43.200> control<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:44.070> we<00:01:44.430> started<00:01:44.790> looking<00:01:44.850> at<00:01:45.360> a

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
of control so we started looking at a

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.510 
of control so we started looking at a
lot<00:01:46.049> of<00:01:46.110> third-party<00:01:46.650> software<00:01:46.830> we<00:01:47.190> started

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
lot of third-party software we started

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.100 
lot of third-party software we started
looking<00:01:47.610> at<00:01:47.909> developing<00:01:48.090> tech<00:01:48.600> internally

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
looking at developing tech internally

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.410 
looking at developing tech internally
and<00:01:49.860> ultimately<00:01:50.280> we<00:01:50.790> ended<00:01:51.060> up<00:01:51.150> forming

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
and ultimately we ended up forming

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.450 
and ultimately we ended up forming
partnerships<00:01:51.930> with<00:01:52.320> companies<00:01:52.590> like<00:01:52.830> pixel<00:01:53.310> X

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460

molecular<00:01:56.310> matter<00:01:56.520> which<00:01:56.909> is<00:01:57.150> a<00:01:57.360> simulation

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
molecular matter which is a simulation

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.200 
molecular matter which is a simulation

materials behave in the real world based
on<00:02:02.490> real-world<00:02:02.700> properties<00:02:03.420> so<00:02:03.600> when<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:03.810> throw

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
on real-world properties so when I throw

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.140 
on real-world properties so when I throw
a<00:02:04.110> stormtrooper<00:02:04.560> into<00:02:05.010> a<00:02:05.190> set<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.729> metal<00:02:05.940> door

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
a stormtrooper into a set of metal door

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.730 
a stormtrooper into a set of metal door
as<00:02:06.330> those<00:02:06.510> doors<00:02:06.750> will<00:02:06.960> actually<00:02:07.290> bend<00:02:07.500> and

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
as those doors will actually bend and

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.009 
as those doors will actually bend and
buckle<00:02:08.099> we<00:02:08.640> also<00:02:08.819> formed<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.420> partnership<00:02:09.659> with

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
buckle we also formed a partnership with

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:11.780 
buckle we also formed a partnership with
a<00:02:10.049> company<00:02:10.110> called<00:02:10.409> natural<00:02:11.009> motion<00:02:11.189> to

which<00:02:14.069> infuses<00:02:14.489> all<00:02:14.760> of<00:02:14.879> our<00:02:15.000> characters<00:02:15.420> with

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
which infuses all of our characters with

which infuses all of our characters with
biomechanical<00:02:16.680> AI<00:02:16.799> so<00:02:17.129> when<00:02:17.250> I<00:02:17.280> gripped<00:02:17.610> that

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
biomechanical AI so when I gripped that

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.820 
biomechanical AI so when I gripped that
storm<00:02:18.060> trooper<00:02:18.480> he'll<00:02:18.930> ride<00:02:19.230> then<00:02:19.590> when<00:02:19.739> he

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
storm trooper he'll ride then when he

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.350 
storm trooper he'll ride then when he
actually<00:02:20.010> hits<00:02:20.400> that<00:02:20.580> door<00:02:20.879> he'll<00:02:21.120> try<00:02:21.150> and

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
actually hits that door he'll try and

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.570 
actually hits that door he'll try and
protect<00:02:21.660> himself<00:02:21.870> or<00:02:22.319> he'll<00:02:22.770> roll<00:02:23.130> with<00:02:23.370> the

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
protect himself or he'll roll with the

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.010 
protect himself or he'll roll with the
fall<00:02:24.180> when<00:02:24.390> he<00:02:24.540> slams

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
fall when he slams

fall when he slams
the<00:02:25.200> ground<00:02:25.410> so<00:02:25.680> all<00:02:25.890> these<00:02:26.040> things<00:02:26.100> is<00:02:26.820> really

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
the ground so all these things is really

give us a much more interactive and
destructible<00:02:30.990> environment<00:02:31.590> but<00:02:31.650> we've<00:02:31.830> seen
