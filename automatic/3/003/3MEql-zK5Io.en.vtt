hours so this is how she taught me what

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.820 
hours so this is how she taught me what
she<00:01:27.459> did<00:01:27.640> is<00:01:27.909> if<00:01:28.270> you<00:01:28.600> need<00:01:28.750> to<00:01:28.929> start<00:01:29.319> by<00:01:29.770> doing

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
she did is if you need to start by doing

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.789 
she did is if you need to start by doing
some<00:01:30.250> really<00:01:30.520> good<00:01:30.670> stretches<00:01:31.209> go<00:01:32.170> down<00:01:32.409> onto

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
some really good stretches go down onto

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.389 
some really good stretches go down onto
the<00:01:32.920> floor<00:01:33.250> and<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:35.380> should<00:01:35.530> push<00:01:35.709> up<00:01:35.950> into<00:01:36.159> a

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
the floor and you should push up into a

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:39.630 
the floor and you should push up into a
bridge<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:37.840> you<00:01:38.289> can<00:01:38.409> just<00:01:38.709> go<00:01:39.100> down<00:01:39.130> off<00:01:39.459> the

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
bridge so you can just go down off the

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:47.580 
bridge so you can just go down off the
floor<00:01:40.350> as<00:01:41.350> shown<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:46.030> just<00:01:46.090> push<00:01:46.600> up<00:01:46.780> into<00:01:47.319> a

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
floor as shown and just push up into a

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:55.589 
floor as shown and just push up into a
bridge<00:01:47.830> it<00:01:48.159> just<00:01:48.340> hold<00:01:48.549> it<00:01:52.590> okay<00:01:54.060> so<00:01:55.060> after

00:01:55.589 --> 00:01:55.599 
bridge it just hold it okay so after

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:56.930 
bridge it just hold it okay so after
you've<00:01:55.720> done<00:01:55.750> that<00:01:55.869> for<00:01:56.170> a<00:01:56.229> couple<00:01:56.560> minutes

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
you've done that for a couple minutes

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.160 
you've done that for a couple minutes
then<00:01:57.940> you<00:01:58.060> might<00:01:58.179> want<00:01:58.390> to<00:01:58.420> start<00:01:58.599> stretching

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
then you might want to start stretching

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.990 
then you might want to start stretching
you<00:01:59.979> should<00:02:00.099> go<00:02:00.160> like<00:02:00.340> this<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:01.750> just<00:02:03.000> like

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
you should go like this and just like

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.729 
you should go like this and just like
this<00:02:04.209> come<00:02:04.989> back<00:02:05.200> in<00:02:05.560> this<00:02:06.450> then<00:02:07.450> back<00:02:07.690> and<00:02:08.530> you

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
this come back in this then back and you

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.830 
this come back in this then back and you
can<00:02:08.890> kind<00:02:09.129> of<00:02:09.190> go<00:02:09.250> like<00:02:09.280> this<00:02:09.580> back<00:02:10.390> and<00:02:10.660> if<00:02:10.810> you

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
can kind of go like this back and if you

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.170

need to look your hands on all time till
doing<00:04:04.700> it<00:04:04.790> back<00:04:04.940> then<00:04:05.150> because<00:04:05.600> it's<00:04:05.810> probably

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
doing it back then because it's probably

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.990 
doing it back then because it's probably
the<00:04:06.170> safest<00:04:06.530> because<00:04:07.310> if<00:04:07.430> you<00:04:07.520> just<00:04:07.700> look<00:04:07.790> over

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
the safest because if you just look over

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.530 
the safest because if you just look over
here

here

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.180 
here
you're<00:04:08.780> probably<00:04:08.959> gonna<00:04:09.230> fall<00:04:09.500> on<00:04:09.530> your<00:04:09.740> face

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
you're probably gonna fall on your face

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.010 
you're probably gonna fall on your face
just<00:04:10.760> sayin<00:04:11.240> so<00:04:12.760> remember<00:04:13.760> and<00:04:14.030> as<00:04:14.450> you<00:04:14.630> go<00:04:14.780> on

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.020 
just sayin so remember and as you go on

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.620 
just sayin so remember and as you go on
don't<00:04:15.770> be<00:04:16.580> trying<00:04:16.850> to<00:04:16.910> go<00:04:17.000> to<00:04:17.060> the<00:04:17.239> next<00:04:17.390> step

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
don't be trying to go to the next step

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.190 
don't be trying to go to the next step
so<00:04:17.840> fast<00:04:18.520> like<00:04:19.520> some<00:04:20.120> people<00:04:20.390> that<00:04:20.510> once<00:04:21.049> they

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
so fast like some people that once they

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.300 
so fast like some people that once they
get<00:04:21.320> their<00:04:21.500> back<00:04:21.650> might<00:04:21.830> want<00:04:21.980> to<00:04:22.010> say<00:04:22.160> just

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
get their back might want to say just

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.770 
get their back might want to say just
barely<00:04:22.490> do<00:04:22.760> this<00:04:22.940> they<00:04:23.090> try<00:04:23.300> to<00:04:23.360> start<00:04:23.540> taking

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
barely do this they try to start taking

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.770 
barely do this they try to start taking
over<00:04:24.020> and<00:04:24.350> that<00:04:24.800> doesn't<00:04:25.100> really<00:04:25.220> help<00:04:25.490> so<00:04:26.450> you

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
over and that doesn't really help so you

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.750 
over and that doesn't really help so you
might<00:04:26.930> want<00:04:27.080> to<00:04:27.140> get<00:04:27.800> your<00:04:27.980> back<00:04:28.160> bend<00:04:28.400> first
