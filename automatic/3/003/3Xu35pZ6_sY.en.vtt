Realty<00:00:22.199> was<00:00:22.410> building<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.920> facility<00:00:23.130> in<00:00:23.670> a

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
Realty was building a facility in a

Realty was building a facility in a
secondary<00:00:24.300> market<00:00:24.779> what<00:00:24.900> we<00:00:24.990> didn't<00:00:25.199> want<00:00:25.230> to

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
secondary market what we didn't want to

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.230 
secondary market what we didn't want to
do<00:00:25.470> was<00:00:25.590> sacrifice<00:00:25.769> on<00:00:26.279> quality<00:00:26.760> in<00:00:26.849> any<00:00:27.000> way

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
do was sacrifice on quality in any way

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.330 
do was sacrifice on quality in any way
and<00:00:27.480> so<00:00:27.930> we<00:00:28.080> went<00:00:28.230> with<00:00:28.349> best-of-breed<00:00:28.830> from<00:00:29.250> a

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
and so we went with best-of-breed from a

and so we went with best-of-breed from a
design<00:00:29.670> standpoint<00:00:30.029> from<00:00:30.390> every<00:00:30.720> piece<00:00:30.929> of

early<00:00:53.879> on<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:54.239> we<00:00:54.300> could<00:00:54.510> work<00:00:54.690> with<00:00:54.840> our

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
early on that we could work with our

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
get us a vision early on of what we

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.709 
get us a vision early on of what we
wanted<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.140> facility<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.829> be<00:01:02.539> because<00:01:03.539> the

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
wanted this facility to be because the

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.210 
wanted this facility to be because the
burgh<00:01:03.870> vic<00:01:04.049> floor<00:01:04.290> doesn't<00:01:04.619> require<00:01:04.799> all<00:01:05.100> the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
burgh vic floor doesn't require all the

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.890 
burgh vic floor doesn't require all the
pedestals<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.880> traditional<00:01:06.420> florida's

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
pedestals that a traditional florida's

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.510 
pedestals that a traditional florida's
it<00:01:07.110> was<00:01:07.500> about<00:01:07.710> half<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:07.979> time<00:01:08.159> of

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
it was about half the time of

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.370 
it was about half the time of
installation<00:01:08.760> for<00:01:09.420> what<00:01:09.570> we<00:01:09.689> were<00:01:09.810> able<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.229> do

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
installation for what we were able to do

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.109 
installation for what we were able to do
so<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.710> really<00:01:10.890> shorten<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.640> construction

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
so it really shorten the construction

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.940 
so it really shorten the construction
time<00:01:12.299> frame<00:01:12.600> they<00:01:12.990> were<00:01:13.049> able<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.439> keep<00:01:13.560> us<00:01:13.770> on

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
time frame they were able to keep us on

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.859 
time frame they were able to keep us on
schedule<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.549> our<00:01:14.729> ongoing<00:01:14.909> growth<00:01:15.390> will<00:01:15.750> be

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
schedule and our ongoing growth will be

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.210 
schedule and our ongoing growth will be
able<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.110> put<00:01:16.409> their<00:01:16.560> floor<00:01:16.799> in<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.070> much

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
able to put their floor in a much

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.429 
able to put their floor in a much
quicker<00:01:17.400> amount<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:17.909> time<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.840> panel<00:01:19.140> system

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
quicker amount of time the panel system

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.740 
quicker amount of time the panel system
itself<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.220> very<00:01:20.580> strong<00:01:20.909> flooring<00:01:21.360> system

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
itself is a very strong flooring system

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.499 
itself is a very strong flooring system
because<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.619> substructure<00:01:23.070> being<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.090> tube

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
because of the substructure being a tube

because of the substructure being a tube
steel<00:01:24.840> frame<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.310> much<00:01:26.490> more<00:01:26.520> weight

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
steel frame it is much more weight

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.370

bearing<00:01:27.150> than<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.390> traditional<00:01:27.600> pedestal

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
bearing than a traditional pedestal

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.170 
bearing than a traditional pedestal
floor<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:28.950> did<00:01:29.070> not<00:01:29.189> require<00:01:29.579> us<00:01:29.880> buying
