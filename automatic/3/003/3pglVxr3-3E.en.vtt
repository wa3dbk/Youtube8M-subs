00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
other transmission and it's a bit of a

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.510 
other transmission and it's a bit of a
process<00:00:16.289> you<00:00:16.619> got<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:16.830> pull<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.010> rear<00:00:17.220> part

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
process you got to pull the rear part

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.279 
process you got to pull the rear part
and<00:00:17.760> you<00:00:18.119> know<00:00:18.210> everything<00:00:18.449> else<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.810> kind<00:00:19.199> of

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
and you know everything else to kind of

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.740 
and you know everything else to kind of
go<00:00:19.380> do<00:00:19.560> it<00:00:19.740> because<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.520> transaxle<00:00:21.150> but<00:00:21.480> it<00:00:21.600> is

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
go do it because the transaxle but it is

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.700 
go do it because the transaxle but it is
done<00:00:24.439> when<00:00:25.439> I<00:00:25.500> drain<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.859> oil<00:00:25.890> out<00:00:26.189> of<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:27.710> the

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
done when I drain the oil out of the the

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.189 
done when I drain the oil out of the the
old<00:00:29.179> the<00:00:30.179> motor<00:00:30.390> that<00:00:30.539> was<00:00:30.689> in<00:00:30.840> there<00:00:31.050> yeah

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
old the motor that was in there yeah

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.770 
old the motor that was in there yeah
it's<00:00:32.009> good<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.160> see<00:00:32.309> that<00:00:32.550> it's<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.570> little

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
it's good to see that it's a little

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.080 
it's good to see that it's a little
world<00:00:34.079> with<00:00:34.230> copper<00:00:34.590> going<00:00:34.829> down<00:00:34.980> there<00:00:35.219> this

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
world with copper going down there this

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.700 
world with copper going down there this
this<00:00:36.390> was<00:00:36.570> new<00:00:36.750> oil<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.260> was<00:00:37.380> only<00:00:37.559> in

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
this was new oil and it was only in

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.160 
this was new oil and it was only in
there<00:00:37.890> for<00:00:38.010> I'm<00:00:38.910> lucky<00:00:39.570> if<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.690> ran<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:39.989> two

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
there for I'm lucky if I ran it two

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.119 
there for I'm lucky if I ran it two
minutes<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:41.090> as<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.149> said<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.690> in<00:00:43.559> first<00:00:43.950> and

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
minutes and as I said it in first and

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.440 
minutes and as I said it in first and
third<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.610> go<00:00:44.730> with<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:44.969> clutch<00:00:45.149> out<00:00:45.329> we'll

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
third you go with the clutch out we'll

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.240 
third you go with the clutch out we'll
just<00:00:45.600> push<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:45.989> right<00:00:46.020> out<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.350> grind<00:00:46.800> real

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
just push it right out and grind real

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.729 
just push it right out and grind real
hard<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:47.879> have<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.480> feeling<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.230> synchros

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
hard I have a feeling that the synchros

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.709 
hard I have a feeling that the synchros
are<00:00:49.920> something<00:00:50.670> happened<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.270> synchros

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
are something happened to the synchros

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.100 
are something happened to the synchros
and<00:00:52.879> that<00:00:53.879> was<00:00:54.000> probably<00:00:54.329> what<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.690> failure

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
and that was probably what the failure

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.990 
and that was probably what the failure
is<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:55.920> transmission<00:00:56.719> hopefully<00:00:59.000> my

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
is in that transmission hopefully my

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.970 
is in that transmission hopefully my
issues<00:01:00.420> are<00:01:00.570> solved<00:01:00.930> now<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.649> all<00:01:01.800> back

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
issues are solved now it is all back

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.280 
issues are solved now it is all back
together<00:01:02.129> ready<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.699> go<00:01:02.789> fire<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.270> up<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:06.290> it

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
together ready to go fire it up and it

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.750 
together ready to go fire it up and it
the<00:01:07.560> emergency<00:01:07.830> brakes<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.460> bled<00:01:08.670> the

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
the emergency brakes on and bled the

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.640 
the emergency brakes on and bled the
brakes<00:01:08.790> or<00:01:09.090> anything<00:01:09.270> like<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.650> but

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
brakes or anything like that but

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.260 
brakes or anything like that but
everything<00:01:10.860> else<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.220> hooked<00:01:11.430> up<00:01:11.640> other<00:01:12.030> than

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
everything else is hooked up other than

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.330 
everything else is hooked up other than
the<00:01:12.570> trailer<00:01:12.900> hitch<00:01:13.170> through<00:01:13.740> tires<00:01:13.950> bleed

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
the trailer hitch through tires bleed

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.420 
the trailer hitch through tires bleed
the<00:01:14.430> brakes<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:16.110> think<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.740> rear<00:01:16.920> opinion

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
the brakes and I think the rear opinion

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.249 
the brakes and I think the rear opinion
has<00:01:17.610> no<00:01:17.759> anything<00:01:17.970> that's<00:01:18.240> not<00:01:18.390> really<00:01:19.020> done

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
has no anything that's not really done

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.109 
has no anything that's not really done
on<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.619> but<00:01:20.369> it's<00:01:20.520> still<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.759> point<00:01:20.909> where<00:01:21.090> I

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
on it but it's still the point where I

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.270 
on it but it's still the point where I
could<00:01:21.270> fire<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.630> up<00:01:21.750> run<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.560> haven't<00:01:22.950> done

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
could fire it up run it I haven't done

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.010 
could fire it up run it I haven't done
any<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.610> yet<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.270> we'll<00:01:24.720> see<00:01:24.840> what<00:01:24.930> we

here it all depends on how warm I have
the<00:04:43.690> garage<00:04:43.960> because<00:04:44.650> that<00:04:45.010> wax<00:04:45.370> you<00:04:45.670> have<00:04:45.700> to

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
the garage because that wax you have to

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.420 
the garage because that wax you have to
heat<00:04:46.090> it<00:04:46.120> up<00:04:46.330> and<00:04:46.570> spray<00:04:47.110> it<00:04:47.290> quickly<00:04:47.530> so<00:04:48.010> that

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
heat it up and spray it quickly so that

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.770 
heat it up and spray it quickly so that
would<00:04:49.000> be<00:04:49.090> the<00:04:49.210> deciding<00:04:49.630> factor<00:04:49.780> on<00:04:50.320> that<00:04:50.350> but

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
would be the deciding factor on that but

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.380 
would be the deciding factor on that but

and<00:05:06.990> square<00:05:07.990> it<00:05:08.110> up<00:05:08.170> and<00:05:08.350> put<00:05:08.470> it<00:05:08.560> back<00:05:08.650> on

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
and square it up and put it back on

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.720 
and square it up and put it back on
again

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:13.730 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.660 

ladies<00:05:14.730> hopefully<00:05:15.270> no<00:05:16.080> drippy<00:05:16.410> drips

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:16.670 
ladies hopefully no drippy drips

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.160 
ladies hopefully no drippy drips
shouldn't<00:05:17.670> be<00:05:17.790> how<00:05:18.330> to<00:05:18.390> make<00:05:18.570> new<00:05:18.720> gaskets

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.170 
shouldn't be how to make new gaskets

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:36.060 
shouldn't be how to make new gaskets
again<00:05:19.880> it<00:05:20.880> looks<00:05:21.120> good<00:05:22.790> so

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.379 

back<00:05:36.640> up

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:38.389 
back up

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:39.879 
back up
I'll<00:05:38.810> get<00:05:39.020> to<00:05:39.199> it<00:05:39.289> I<00:05:39.349> guess<00:05:39.530> you<00:05:39.620> guys<00:05:39.710> don't

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:39.889 
I'll get to it I guess you guys don't

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:42.610 
I'll get to it I guess you guys don't
need<00:05:40.009> to<00:05:40.099> watch<00:05:40.310> this<00:05:40.340> part<00:05:40.729> of<00:05:40.819> it<00:05:40.909> but<00:05:41.620> that's

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
need to watch this part of it but that's

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.770 
need to watch this part of it but that's
it<00:05:42.860> he'll<00:05:43.219> bleed<00:05:43.400> some<00:05:43.550> brakes<00:05:43.759> and<00:05:44.060> get<00:05:44.689> my

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
it he'll bleed some brakes and get my

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.959 
it he'll bleed some brakes and get my
wheels<00:05:44.960> back<00:05:45.050> on<00:05:45.169> it<00:05:45.530> and<00:05:45.650> have<00:05:46.610> it<00:05:46.699> so<00:05:46.819> it's

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:46.969 
wheels back on it and have it so it's

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:48.459 
wheels back on it and have it so it's
mobile<00:05:47.330> again<00:05:47.449> maybe<00:05:47.930> take<00:05:48.080> it<00:05:48.169> for<00:05:48.289> a<00:05:48.319> ride

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:48.469 
mobile again maybe take it for a ride

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:50.709 
mobile again maybe take it for a ride
down<00:05:48.710> the<00:05:48.830> road<00:05:48.949> but<00:05:49.360> it's<00:05:50.360> the<00:05:50.449> exact<00:05:50.689> same

00:05:50.709 --> 00:05:50.719 
down the road but it's the exact same

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:52.420 
down the road but it's the exact same
transmission<00:05:51.259> that<00:05:51.469> was<00:05:51.500> in<00:05:51.710> it<00:05:51.830> so<00:05:52.009> I<00:05:52.039> do<00:05:52.189> not

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
transmission that was in it so I do not

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.010 
transmission that was in it so I do not
think<00:05:52.729> that<00:05:52.789> I'm<00:05:53.419> not<00:05:53.539> gonna<00:05:53.689> have<00:05:53.810> any<00:05:53.930> issues

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 
think that I'm not gonna have any issues

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.010 
think that I'm not gonna have any issues
I<00:05:54.409> just<00:05:54.590> think<00:05:54.879> what<00:05:55.879> I<00:05:55.909> had<00:05:56.300> found<00:05:56.509> was<00:05:56.840> what

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020 
I just think what I had found was what

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.279 
I just think what I had found was what
it<00:05:57.169> was<00:05:57.259> it<00:05:57.710> was<00:05:57.889> not<00:05:58.659> pushing<00:05:59.659> far<00:06:00.080> enough

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:00.289 
it was it was not pushing far enough

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:03.790 
it was it was not pushing far enough
into<00:06:00.530> first<00:06:00.770> year<00:06:01.069> with<00:06:01.280> the<00:06:01.430> fork<00:06:01.699> so<00:06:02.800> that

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
into first year with the fork so that

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.830 
into first year with the fork so that
seemed<00:06:04.009> to<00:06:04.099> uh<00:06:04.129> solve<00:06:04.430> it<00:06:04.580> because<00:06:04.729> before<00:06:05.090> as

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 
seemed to uh solve it because before as

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:06.909 
seemed to uh solve it because before as
soon<00:06:06.050> as<00:06:06.139> you<00:06:06.199> would<00:06:06.319> let<00:06:06.439> off<00:06:06.530> the<00:06:06.650> clutch<00:06:06.680> if

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:06.919 
soon as you would let off the clutch if

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:07.990 
soon as you would let off the clutch if
you<00:06:07.009> didn't<00:06:07.159> have<00:06:07.250> your<00:06:07.310> hand<00:06:07.580> on<00:06:07.729> the<00:06:07.819> shift

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
you didn't have your hand on the shift

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.070 
you didn't have your hand on the shift
that<00:06:08.060> would<00:06:08.240> just<00:06:08.389> it<00:06:08.599> would<00:06:08.689> just<00:06:08.840> fall<00:06:09.050> back

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 
that would just it would just fall back

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.730 
that would just it would just fall back
out<00:06:09.500> it<00:06:09.650> out<00:06:09.770> of<00:06:09.919> gear<00:06:10.159> you<00:06:10.460> know<00:06:10.639> so<00:06:11.000> uh<00:06:11.740> I'm

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740 
out it out of gear you know so uh I'm

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:13.450 
out it out of gear you know so uh I'm
happy<00:06:12.949> for<00:06:13.069> that

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.460 
happy for that

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:14.890 
happy for that
I<00:06:13.490> was<00:06:13.610> house<00:06:13.789> worried<00:06:14.150> last<00:06:14.300> night<00:06:14.539> that<00:06:14.719> I

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:14.900 
I was house worried last night that I

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.589 
I was house worried last night that I
could<00:06:15.409> double<00:06:15.710> thinking<00:06:16.039> whether<00:06:16.250> I<00:06:16.729> go<00:06:17.389> did<00:06:17.539> I

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:17.599 
could double thinking whether I go did I

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:18.969 
could double thinking whether I go did I
screw<00:06:17.840> up<00:06:17.870> second<00:06:18.289> gear<00:06:18.409> now<00:06:18.560> that<00:06:18.710> I<00:06:18.770> go<00:06:18.919> too

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:18.979 
screw up second gear now that I go too

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:23.860 
screw up second gear now that I go too
far<00:06:20.319> but<00:06:21.520> again<00:06:22.520> I<00:06:22.550> may<00:06:22.699> make<00:06:22.879> a<00:06:22.909> jig<00:06:23.300> that<00:06:23.779> the

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:23.870 
far but again I may make a jig that the

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.230 
far but again I may make a jig that the
other<00:06:23.990> transmission<00:06:24.529> and<00:06:25.000> that<00:06:26.000> way<00:06:26.090> I'll<00:06:26.210> be

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.240 
other transmission and that way I'll be

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.730 
other transmission and that way I'll be
able<00:06:26.330> to<00:06:26.539> see<00:06:26.629> what's<00:06:26.810> going<00:06:26.870> on<00:06:27.139> inside<00:06:27.379> them

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:27.740 
able to see what's going on inside them

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.670 
able to see what's going on inside them
and<00:06:27.860> kind<00:06:28.279> of<00:06:28.310> bring<00:06:28.490> them<00:06:28.550> the<00:06:28.669> shows<00:06:28.879> and

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 
and kind of bring them the shows and

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.019 
and kind of bring them the shows and
people<00:06:30.680> can<00:06:30.949> look<00:06:31.129> at<00:06:31.250> it<00:06:31.400> too<00:06:31.550> and<00:06:31.580> see<00:06:31.879> the

00:06:32.019 --> 00:06:32.029 
people can look at it too and see the

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:35.950 
people can look at it too and see the
how<00:06:32.930> the<00:06:32.990> transmission<00:06:33.409> operates<00:06:34.840> maybe<00:06:35.840> a

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:35.960 
how the transmission operates maybe a

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.320 
how the transmission operates maybe a
little<00:06:36.349> accessory<00:06:36.860> there<00:06:37.159> yeah<00:06:37.370> all<00:06:38.240> right

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:38.330 
little accessory there yeah all right

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.119 
little accessory there yeah all right
