 ghost dot net and good we start with 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.070
 another tour of the best apps 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.630
 for mobile devices because today is 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.189
 Wednesday and you know that you play a tour 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.230
 of free applications by time 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.090
 limited and we started with a video game 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.010
 great that is available for something is 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.870
 universal and also for android it 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.190
 call group let's get a little 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.840
 so you can see the interface a bit 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.579
 notice that we have different missions 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.620
 an old casual as you are seeing 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.820
 we have to choose to play the mission that 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.379
 we want, let's play 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.090
 number 6 because I think it's pretty 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.100
 descriptive of how the 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.440
 videogame we have to break through and 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.030
 get to the little door that 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.309
 that you are looking at the bottom and for that 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.320
 we have to destroy these tiles 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.969
 colors as you are going to see now we are going to 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.729
 see let's take this box we're going to 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.310
 put it here and we're going to release then the 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.170
 box here because now we're going to 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.149
 fijaros that was destroying 2 is 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.310
 automatic when we put on top it 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:16.290
 destroy the other the yellow one fix that 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.880
 we have to do something else as you see 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.560
 let's put ourselves here we put here the 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.530
 box to pass 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.340
 let's see we take the box we move it 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.170
 here 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.180
 note that now touching on the tile 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.980
 we become we take the color to 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.900
 end of the tile we left the 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.450
 tile and notice that we destroyed it from 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.610
 this cool way not to notice that at 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.560
 destroy all the tiles opens the 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.900
 door and we simply have 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.490
 have to open a way to get to it 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.040
 video game really that seems simple 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.870
 it's a casual I play short missions 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.250
 but that really is super super 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:51.390
 addictive I recommend it and we continue 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.979
 good guys and girls as we continue 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.479
 with an application that is a more cap 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.490
 for my taste it is a pretty application 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.350
 simple that does something very concrete like 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.670
 You're going to see one now called fech 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.590
 application that is compatible with the me 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.970
 it's universal and also with android we're going 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.320
 to get into the application and look 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.060
 what he does is like I say very 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.369
 concrete allows us to download 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.649
 wallpapers allows us to download ringtones 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.900
 of call and allows us to download all 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.340
 of notifications something very concrete but 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.530
 that really is very cool because I have 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.000
 a very extensive catalog and if you like 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.850
 How to customize your equipment 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.410
 both visually and musically at 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.270
 end with ringtones and such 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.160
 because this is a pretty application 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.900
 pretty cool and that really works 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.340
 very very good to see that we have 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.410
 different categories in each of 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.780
 these popular featured sections 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.580
 recent and categories we will not be able to 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.830
 choose any of these categories and 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.750
 we could choose to download then 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.250
 the blows and two in this case that more 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.170
 like and that are associated with our 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.700
 Thematic does not fix the ones that really 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.710
 there are some pretty cool this 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.360
 like for example nothing just you 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.550
 We give to download is saved in 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.410
 automatically on our device and 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.690
 from there we can put this 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.610
 photography as wallpaper 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.020
 also if we want to download ringtones 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.880
 in the end it is quite simple 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.040
 we can do the same procedure we 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.840
 we put we could reproduce it and 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.220
 we would give dietary ringtone there 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.080
 nuance that in android is much more 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.760
 Simple download the ringtones in May 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.580
 it's a little bit more complicated and we have 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.350
 to go through itunes but we have 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.450
 the advantage that we have an application 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.190
 that is called without which is going to 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.170
 save quite a problem because 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.270
 contain if we download it in 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.160
 our computer installed and read 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.840
 the strong code that will show us the 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.670
 teaching application in this way 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.530
 we are tuning our computer 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.360
 with this application 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.700
 than us when we make a ringtone 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.430
 or a notification from this application 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.170
 it's going to really lower us in our 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.940
 computer and then when we start by 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.860
 cable to synchronize the to put 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.630
 here the ringtones and the 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.190
 notifications something really that is 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.819
 quite original and can solve the 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.470
 problem 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.569
 cumbersome that can be as well as other 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.860
 applications that you lower in the tone 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.480
 you have to put the ayto is a bit 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.580
 rollete well with this system we can 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.530
 do automatically here explains it 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.300
 the whole truth is that here he explains it 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.920
 everything is a video if you want to see it for 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.840
 see how it works and it really is 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.500
 pretty cool not good an application 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.820
 highly recommended and we continue good 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.260
 guys and girls you already know that that 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.239
 is liking this video and if you like it 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.980
 the series of free apps I would appreciate 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.330
 that you support us with a like for 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.130
 to be able to move forward with our 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.600
 other project if you liked what 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.160
 Enough you can share this video 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.510
 with all your friends sometimes they 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.579
 they also like it and can take advantage 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.720
 all these general offers good 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.729
 we continue with a video game that 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.770
 llama mister runner 2 is a video game 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:27.060
 casual really very cool where are we going to 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.160
 play a mission so that you 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.050
 see a little bit what is the theme of the 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.790
 game is super simple so it's a 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.930
 video game of these ideals to play 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.529
 at any time and in any 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.269
 place 

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:37.889
 and well, we're here, we're from 

00:04:36.269 --> 00:04:39.659
 this little character and what we have to 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:40.949
 to do is simply to touch on the part 

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:43.109
 right or touch to the left 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:44.909
 let's catch this from here estimate for 

00:04:43.109 --> 00:04:46.769
 catch all the coins that are going away 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:48.179
 in front we have to go around all 

00:04:46.769 --> 00:04:49.469
 the obstacles here has killed us a 

00:04:48.179 --> 00:04:51.359
 lightning we will have to have avoided it 

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:53.069
 good as we play simply if 

00:04:51.359 --> 00:04:54.869
 we play on the right side we're going to 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:56.729
 accelerate as you see to see now but 

00:04:54.869 --> 00:04:58.109
 notice that we get tired if we play in 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:58.859
 the left part fixed we stayed 

00:04:58.109 --> 00:05:00.809
 slowly 

00:04:58.859 --> 00:05:02.789
 in this way we are going to have to 

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:04.169
 try to catch all the all 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:05.939
 stars in the end to notice that 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:07.649
 star we would have to take the 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:08.879
 we have taken perfectly and from this 

00:05:07.649 --> 00:05:10.679
 way we will also have to dodge 

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:12.119
 the obstacles for example this 

00:05:10.679 --> 00:05:13.499
 obstacle of the rays we are going to catch 

00:05:12.119 --> 00:05:15.329
 now the trunk this since we have 

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:16.709
 got perfect catch let's see 

00:05:15.329 --> 00:05:18.149
 what else we find here we go to 

00:05:16.709 --> 00:05:19.979
 run here we have a star we 

00:05:18.149 --> 00:05:20.729
 We have passed the star seems easy 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:22.829
 but the truth is that it is quite 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.419
 complicated and that's why for my taste 

00:05:22.829 --> 00:05:25.679
 It makes a video game quite addictive 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:27.089
 You will do the delights of all 

00:05:25.679 --> 00:05:28.829
 casual gamers those who are 

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:30.389
 playing physical and jumping the key 

00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:32.489
 those who leave from time to time 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:34.019
 in the bakery spheres and all 

00:05:32.489 --> 00:05:35.669
 these things not good guys and girls 

00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:37.229
