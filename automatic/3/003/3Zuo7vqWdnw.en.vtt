quickly o'clock hour

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.139 
quickly o'clock hour
like<00:01:53.890> once<00:01:54.100> you<00:01:54.159> got<00:01:54.340> this<00:01:54.430> opening<00:01:54.880> will<00:01:55.090> you

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 
like once you got this opening will you

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:56.539 
like once you got this opening will you
think<00:01:55.359> about<00:01:55.509> opening<00:01:55.750> somewhere<00:01:55.990> else<00:01:56.229> I

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
think about opening somewhere else I

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.560 
think about opening somewhere else I
wasn't<00:01:57.549> I<00:01:58.479> was<00:01:58.899> thinking<00:01:59.439> about<00:01:59.740> a<00:02:00.070> pub<00:02:00.609> in

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
wasn't I was thinking about a pub in

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.760 
wasn't I was thinking about a pub in
Notting<00:02:01.990> Hill<00:02:02.820> but<00:02:03.820> I<00:02:03.880> think<00:02:04.750> that<00:02:05.049> the<00:02:05.259> the

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
Notting Hill but I think that the the

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.699 
Notting Hill but I think that the the
burden<00:02:06.219> of<00:02:06.340> opening<00:02:06.670> this<00:02:07.080> has<00:02:08.080> taken<00:02:08.440> its

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
burden of opening this has taken its

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.320 
burden of opening this has taken its
toll<00:02:08.769> in<00:02:08.979> a<00:02:09.220> way<00:02:09.399> and<00:02:09.670> I<00:02:09.729> just<00:02:10.000> feel<00:02:10.209> like

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
toll in a way and I just feel like

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.210 
toll in a way and I just feel like
should<00:02:10.450> get<00:02:10.629> this<00:02:10.780> up<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:11.379> running<00:02:11.500> and<00:02:12.099> I

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
should get this up and running and I

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.130 
should get this up and running and I
think<00:02:12.400> that'll<00:02:12.610> take<00:02:12.640> a<00:02:12.819> long<00:02:13.060> time<00:02:13.330> and<00:02:13.840> I

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
think that'll take a long time and I

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.539 
think that'll take a long time and I
might<00:02:14.319> be<00:02:14.440> dead<00:02:14.620> by<00:02:14.799> the<00:02:14.860> time<00:02:14.950> I<00:02:15.190> found<00:02:15.430> the

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:15.549 
might be dead by the time I found the

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:16.920 
might be dead by the time I found the
cell<00:02:15.730> probably<00:02:15.940> won't<00:02:16.090> be<00:02:16.269> anything<00:02:16.450> it's<00:02:16.840> not

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
cell probably won't be anything it's not

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.119 
cell probably won't be anything it's not
easy<00:02:17.170> to<00:02:17.349> open<00:02:17.410> a<00:02:17.590> restaurant<00:02:17.709> when<00:02:18.010> you're

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
easy to open a restaurant when you're

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:23.100 
easy to open a restaurant when you're
dead

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.070 

thank<00:02:23.950> you
