 stunning women and very 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.719
 glam 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.139
 the automobile saloon mexico unconscious 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:16.440
 aficionados of the super machines 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:19.619
 adv was there and in the 27th edition of 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.990
 event had the following mission to trace a 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.960
 the future of the industry 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.670
 automobile in the valley of the paraiba 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.199
 already the investment that had to be 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.009
 already done in this line of 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.020
 production capacity is there there 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.910
 installed Let's just say so I think 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.079
 that we have to continue the dialogue 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.730
 with the union the problem of the people 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.860
 You can get so always open to 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.440
 discussions is an issue that is 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.899
 Our agenda, I think, will depend on the 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.610
 the agreement to negotiate between the two 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.539
 both our own and our 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.789
 Syndicate 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.370
 Anyway, we want as much as possible. 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.199
 reach an agreement that all goes well with 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.340
 the two sides despite the recent 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.160
 turbulence 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.739
 the scenario was not so discouraging 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.650
 the encouragement that may soften the eventual 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.780
 cut about 2 thousand workers 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.790
 come from China with the ability to 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.640
 chery production in jacareí 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.520
 the plant has the total capacity of 150 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.430
 thousand vehicles a year and this can generate 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.650
 in relation to employment how many jobs 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.030
 the key expectation of the key in this 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.979
 this employment issue is 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.159
 interesting enough that it can generate 4 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.520
 thousand jobs and we are beyond that 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.670
 assessing the possibility of absorbing 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.259
 general motorcycle employees who are 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.060
 being waived what will be 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.270
 for this training 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.460
 Our technique in the factory will be 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.049
 partnership in this case, how will you 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.280
 database as will be done so 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.920
 a database will be created 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.869
 individual interviews 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.980
 we understand who are the ones who 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.450
 it is possible to absorb 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.020
 already being done in a 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.480
 investment agreement is 427 million 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.390

 taubaté also serve to 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.400
 sector in our region that will speak 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.990
 now that the episode is always 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.480
 modernizing their assembly lines 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.970
 your factories so that you can really 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.840
 supply within these factories products 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.890
 each time better 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.050
 the more investment the automaker 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.450
 makes a shape a more plant 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.490
 possibilities it has and more volume of 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.890
 production can also have natural 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.660
 the more car will be produced 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.160
 obviously the amount of people 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.410
 involved in production in these cases 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.260
 the highlights presented 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.300

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.790
