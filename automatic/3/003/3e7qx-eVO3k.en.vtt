00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:14.250
 blue sporty and economical so you could 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.870
 describe the new vw polo the new gt 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.320
 he closes the gap between the 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:24.680
 hitherto strongest normal polo with 77 kw 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.680
 and the polo gti with 132 kw power 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.180
 the wolfsburger have a target group 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.099
 also sporty and 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.170
 Dynamic driver's worth on a car 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.180
 that at the same time protects the environment 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.900
 despite higher power consumes the 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:43.370
 logic compared to the 77 kw polo round 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.370
 a half liter less fuel 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.040
 this is ensured by the tsi-motor with active 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.560
 cylinder management that two of the four 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.080
 cylinder at medium speeds 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.720
 shuts off by moving the 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.840
 Camshaft is the gasoline intake 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.339
 interrupted 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.290
 the pistons in the second and third 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:10.450
 Cylinders raise and lower, though 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.450
 Gasoline is not injected 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.869
 the main advantage is that you get it 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.189
 File loads two-cylinder operated very much 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.950
 significantly reduce fuel consumption 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:25.450
 Can reduce CO2 emissions and 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.820
 at the same time in four cylinders 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.649
 operation can retrieve a high performance 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.170
 and then the engine in the four-cylinder 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:33.399
 operating very comfortable from the 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.079
 Cylinder shutdown can be seen in the 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:36.969
 driving nothing from two to four 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:39.069
 cylinder and back the transitions 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:41.350
 are absolutely fluent when the 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:42.850
 Consumption specifications from the manufacturer agree 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.740
 then I have such a vehicle like that 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.360
 athletic and agile connected with one 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.860
 Consumption of significantly less than five liters 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.140
 never driven myself 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.810
 we learn the test vehicle with the 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.579
 seven-speed dual-clutch transmission that 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.539
 is perfectly matched to the vehicle 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:57.549
 if you still have it a bit 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:59.079
 athletic then you press the 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:04.060
 However, one pays for it 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:06.520
 then synonymous with a higher consumption 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.399
 the siebengang dsg is the consumption 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.430
 at 4 5 liters per 100 kilometers 210 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.959
 km / h, the polo gti is quick for that 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.540
 you pay in germany one 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.540
 entry price of 19 1650 euro 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.550
 vw wants the polo especially in europe 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.640
 especially in the countries which sell 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.410
 cars with low co2 emissions 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:32.910
 tax favoring is the blue gt 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.890
 interesting a clear line followed vw 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.660
 not just on an outer one clean 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.819
 processed cockpit and good 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.819
 Accessible controls are standard 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.959
 The seats are well made 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.230
 blue a succinct set nappa 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.230
 accents 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.700
 the polo blue gt can be fast as well 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.230
 slowly in city traffic he runs agile 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.830
 and shows off its comfortable 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.830
 page 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.440
 Unevenness optimally captures the chassis 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.440
 from 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.340
 to carry low consumption carry out measures 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.080
 the bluemotion technology like start 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.610
 stop system and energy recovery 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:39.050
 The big air intakes are striking 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.970
 of the modified bumpers 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.130
 Further measures are the 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:47.610
 Weight reduced 17 inch alloy wheels 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:51.209
 a lowering of 15 mm 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:54.380
 roof edge spoiler and the modified 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.380
 Rear bumper with diffuser 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.680
 vw wants the technology of polo gti 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.160
 in the future also in other models 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.160
 to offer
