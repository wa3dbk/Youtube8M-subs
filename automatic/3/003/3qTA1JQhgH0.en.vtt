00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.109
 this is face to face and the conclusion 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.150
 today the program is that 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.549
 we have to continue we can not 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.980
 simply surrender what we have to 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:17.140
 to do is to deal not only with 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.820
 prayers we have to go outside 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.800
 we have to call by phone we have 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.110
 that we become citizens to be able 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.840
 contribute and that finally these 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.820
 people have an arrangement where they 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.800
 allow the community to be integrated 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.289
 calm and school work is 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.660
 something that a human being deserves in his 

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:37.660
 your basic rights I believe this glory 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:40.390
 yes exactly speaking of mandela I 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.660
 I read a book of him in which he said that 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:46.030
 the fear that stops us most is the power 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.850
 that we have that we do not know that 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.610
 we have so much power to make change and 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.040
 that fear is keeping us there 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.290
 without doing anything we have to take that 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.329
 fear we have that if there are movements 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.940
 they have to go out and go out on the street 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.950
 they do not realize the power so great that 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.350
 there are a million people on the street 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.359
 then we would wait for them when 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.750
 let's make a move do not stay in your 

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:10.060
 home 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.540
 do not be afraid because the struggle continues 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.659
 the fight continues correct roll and you have to 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.420
 remind people that 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.450
 there are many sayings to express where 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.729
 we are right now if we are in the moment 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.969
 the darkest of the night is because because 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.069
 soon it's going to dawn if we're going 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:31.049
 in our lives walking towards 

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:34.140
 ahead with a flag of justice that 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.450
 is the search for immigration reform that 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.770
 It's just for our children who are 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.569
 citizens that is just for these 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.849
 mothers who have stayed here in front 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:43.920
 of their families when their husbands are 

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:45.299
 deported if we go with that flag and 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.159
 We are going through hell right now 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.670
 to continue advancing because 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.920
 surely the fact of 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.390
 that our struggle is for this good for 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.520
 these families that are giving so much 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.829
 this country and we will see the light of day 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.369
 soon we do not have to let ourselves be overcome 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:05.849
 called to mobilizations magnas here in 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.829
 the angels in chicago if it's not this 

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:09.450
 this end of the year already for next year 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.160
 you have to continue with the fight you have to 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.319
 continue with the movement and you do not have to 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.700
 lose lose hope and faith 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.959
 because our struggle is blessed like this 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.360
 we have to achieve immigration reform 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.340
 because they are 11 million 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.470
 to those who need to recognize the 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.120
 contributions that this country has had to 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.820
 this country we have to follow the 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.330
 conclusion is that we do not have left 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:36.450
 another thing to follow with our agenda 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.530
 to be able to support our brothers 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.970
 so many compatriots to our friends 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.490
 family cousins ​​everyone has to 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.350
 someone who is complicated we are not 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.240
 asking us to give us money or that we 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.190
 put in the social assistance system 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.560
 we are asking you to give us the 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.020
 possibility that these people leave 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.690
 of darkness and live as beings 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.840
 humans because they deserve it nobody nobody 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.670
 I want you chased it out 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.980
 could not feed his family and that 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.290
 If you go outside, do not know if you are going to 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.989
 return in what is worse to be paid 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.120
 a misery and not let it progress 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.190
