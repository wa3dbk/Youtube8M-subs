have<00:04:04.870> snoring<00:04:05.709> and<00:04:05.890> that<00:04:06.400> the<00:04:06.519> potential<00:04:07.269> for

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
have snoring and that the potential for

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.680 
have snoring and that the potential for
apnea<00:04:07.870> and<00:04:08.110> it's<00:04:08.860> I<00:04:09.670> believe<00:04:10.120> and<00:04:10.450> it's<00:04:10.570> the

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
apnea and it's I believe and it's the

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.300 
apnea and it's I believe and it's the
opinion<00:04:10.900> of<00:04:11.080> a<00:04:11.140> lot<00:04:11.290> of<00:04:11.410> people<00:04:11.590> that<00:04:11.860> snoring

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
opinion of a lot of people that snoring

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.850 
opinion of a lot of people that snoring
is<00:04:12.610> just<00:04:13.120> the<00:04:13.239> first<00:04:13.450> step<00:04:13.840> in<00:04:14.049> the<00:04:14.140> continuum

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
is just the first step in the continuum

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.409 
is just the first step in the continuum
of<00:04:15.010> developing<00:04:16.000> sleeping<00:04:16.330> disorder

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
of developing sleeping disorder

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.659 
of developing sleeping disorder
breathing<00:04:16.750> problems<00:04:17.350> because<00:04:17.769> with<00:04:18.489> the

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
breathing problems because with the

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.219 
breathing problems because with the
battering<00:04:19.180> of<00:04:19.390> that<00:04:19.540> tissue<00:04:19.810> with<00:04:20.109> the

battering of that tissue with the

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:21.960 
battering of that tissue with the
snoring<00:04:20.739> it<00:04:20.830> might<00:04:21.010> be<00:04:21.220> funny<00:04:21.549> and<00:04:21.789> it's

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
snoring it might be funny and it's

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.790 
snoring it might be funny and it's
something<00:04:22.360> that<00:04:22.570> you<00:04:22.600> laugh<00:04:23.110> about<00:04:23.440> in<00:04:23.650> the

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.250 
hunting the hunting cabin but
yeah<00:04:26.250> we're<00:04:26.640> if<00:04:26.790> that<00:04:27.000> continues<00:04:27.240> its<00:04:27.870> felt<00:04:28.110> by

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
yeah we're if that continues its felt by

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.310 
yeah we're if that continues its felt by
many<00:04:28.320> that<00:04:29.160> the<00:04:29.220> next<00:04:29.820> step<00:04:29.880> from<00:04:30.840> that<00:04:30.930> tissue

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
many that the next step from that tissue

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.460 
many that the next step from that tissue
becoming<00:04:31.920> and<00:04:32.570> gorged<00:04:33.570> and<00:04:33.810> swollen<00:04:34.140> is

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:35.660 
becoming and gorged and swollen is
what's<00:04:34.740> called<00:04:34.890> upper<00:04:35.220> airway<00:04:35.520> resistance

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 
what's called upper airway resistance

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:40.030 
what's called upper airway resistance
hmm<00:04:36.660> where<00:04:37.320> they're<00:04:37.530> actually<00:04:38.070> having<00:04:38.310> some

because of the snoring and if we can

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.340 
because of the snoring and if we can
just<00:04:47.460> stop<00:04:47.910> the<00:04:48.090> problem<00:04:48.630> while<00:04:49.140> it's<00:04:49.260> a

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
just stop the problem while it's a

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.680 
just stop the problem while it's a
snoring<00:04:49.650> problem<00:04:49.770> and<00:04:50.430> it's<00:04:51.300> not<00:04:51.510> that

snoring problem and it's not that

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.360 
snoring problem and it's not that
difficult<00:04:51.870> to<00:04:52.200> do<00:04:52.410> you're<00:04:52.680> already<00:04:52.890> doing<00:04:53.130> it

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
difficult to do you're already doing it

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:54.650

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
appliances you just need to know how to

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.520 
appliances you just need to know how to
quantify<00:04:57.000> that<00:04:57.540> and<00:04:57.600> recognize<00:04:57.840> it<00:04:58.380> for<00:04:58.470> what

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
quantify that and recognize it for what

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.560 
quantify that and recognize it for what
it<00:04:58.740> is<00:04:58.770> so<00:04:59.430> you<00:04:59.460> can<00:04:59.550> more<00:04:59.760> effectively<00:05:00.030> treat

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
it is so you can more effectively treat

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.990 
it is so you can more effectively treat
it<00:05:00.720> then<00:05:01.200> you<00:05:01.350> can<00:05:01.530> help<00:05:01.740> these<00:05:01.890> people<00:05:02.130> and
