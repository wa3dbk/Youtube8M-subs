00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.600
 show you a couple of things that this has 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.490
 so you have a lot of things that are cool 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.230
 first let's start with the mineral 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.760
 the minerals that you have there 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:38.239
 ebony poster for malachite girls 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:43.309
 we follow monster lunar stone by and not 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:47.059
 I remember calling silver with salts 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.630
 trium and quiksilver and we as 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.450
 come 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:54.680
 the materials are the materials 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:57.210
 some materials that are in skyrim 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:01.390
 some not all as you see also 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.550
 there is always snow everywhere 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.420
 come good these materials we can 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.250
 do the postmen you have below 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.799
 in the description you have the link of the 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.960
 post because there are so many things 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.930
 infinite because with each more material 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.729
 more materials armor can be made 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.830
 Everyone here is not here, but let's go 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.720
 come on let's do an example 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.710
 for example steel armor 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.049
 you take this and the elves are already 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.330
 mix is ​​good do not stop it is all the 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.330
 description the dragon bones come out 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.780
 of the frost trolls also with 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.490
 weapons added several various new weapons 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.290
 which is battle ax for example 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:48.600
 here we have you can cover as you see 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:52.290
 let's go there f5 we also have arcs 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.090
 different that of trico for example 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.130
 in creative that's why he could shoot 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:01.500
 you see 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.500
 and what else can we give gas 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:09.770
 arches swords axes axes maces 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.310
 of all these are more open are 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.599
 old battle clubs 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:19.410
 then block the other probable 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:22.630
 this I think they are smaller 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.920
 they are more faster but smaller 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.920
 same as for example him 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.980
 in the dagger or a sword or there's also 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.980
 long sword 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.240
 they are bigger than they were normal but 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.040
 slower and more damage 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.290
 metals these are the same materials 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.210
 but the same minerals that there are but 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:47.390

 the trolls give you the dragon bones 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:41.020
 a rare thing adventurer or adventure is

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:21.989
 I hear 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:33.289

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:37.880
 we have a couple of mods and a few 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:40.880
 there are also many normal zombies and 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:43.310

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.760
 weapons weapons bunch armors other 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.470
 so many today looking here to look at all this 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.260
 and then you can improve as you see there 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:54.460
 it ends so it can be improved 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:56.350
 adding more mineral to the object 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.479

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:01.690

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.620

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.259
 for magic it has no magic 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.919
