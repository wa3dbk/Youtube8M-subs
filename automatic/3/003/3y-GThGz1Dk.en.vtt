00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
common anywhere so if you drive around

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.869 
common anywhere so if you drive around
this<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.320> cannot<00:00:55.590> be<00:00:55.800> accused<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.340> being<00:00:56.579> from

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
this you cannot be accused of being from

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.959

old<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.300> need<00:00:57.559> now<00:00:58.559> as<00:00:58.770> we<00:00:58.980> know<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.489> s-class

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
old you need now as we know the s-class

old you need now as we know the s-class
has<00:01:00.629> lots<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:01.079> features<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:02.309> I'm<00:01:02.430> assuming

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
has lots of features so I'm assuming

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.250 
has lots of features so I'm assuming
that<00:01:03.059> this<00:01:03.210> code<00:01:03.510> would<00:01:03.660> have<00:01:03.809> lots<00:01:04.110> of

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
that this code would have lots of

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.890 
that this code would have lots of
luxuries<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.250> features<00:01:05.729> too<00:01:05.970> but<00:01:06.479> before<00:01:06.869> I

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
luxuries and features too but before I

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.990 
luxuries and features too but before I

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
couldn't go into the car and test them

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.390 
couldn't go into the car and test them
all<00:01:09.210> out<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:09.780> have<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.680> talk<00:01:10.920> about<00:01:10.979> these

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
all out I have to talk about these

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.020 
all out I have to talk about these
styling<00:01:12.090> first<00:01:12.390> impressions<00:01:13.080> its<00:01:13.979> base<00:01:14.250> now

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
styling first impressions its base now

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.749 
styling first impressions its base now
if<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.630> look<00:01:15.869> at<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:17.100> be<00:01:17.250> honest<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.700> know

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
if you look at it to be honest I know

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.240 
if you look at it to be honest I know
you've<00:01:18.299> been<00:01:18.330> driving<00:01:18.840> this<00:01:19.170> styling<00:01:19.860> whilst

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
you've been driving this styling whilst

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.469 
you've been driving this styling whilst
ain't<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:21.110> it<00:01:22.110> just<00:01:22.320> doesn't<00:01:22.590> look<00:01:23.369> well<00:01:24.210> as

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
ain't it it just doesn't look well as

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.130 
ain't it it just doesn't look well as
minor<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:25.080> could<00:01:25.380> be<00:01:26.479> the<00:01:27.479> reason<00:01:27.509> for<00:01:27.840> it

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
minor that could be the reason for it

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.929 
minor that could be the reason for it
because<00:01:28.380> this<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.860> based<00:01:29.070> on<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.520> previous

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
because this is based on the previous

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.219 
because this is based on the previous
s-class<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.229> off<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.740> current<00:01:32.310> one<00:01:32.570> just<00:01:33.570> the

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
s-class and off the current one just the

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.200 
s-class and off the current one just the
same<00:01:34.470> story<00:01:34.979> throughout<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.520> back<00:01:35.759> it

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
same story throughout the back it

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.929 
same story throughout the back it
doesn't<00:01:36.540> look<00:01:36.600> really<00:01:37.229> as<00:01:37.950> well<00:01:38.520> as<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:38.759> could

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
doesn't look really as well as I could

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.999 
doesn't look really as well as I could
be<00:01:39.150> as<00:01:39.240> well<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:40.049> actually<00:01:40.200> looks<00:01:40.439> kind<00:01:40.950> of

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
be as well that actually looks kind of

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.520 
be as well that actually looks kind of
similar<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.670> walk<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.479> terawatt<00:01:43.200> flee
