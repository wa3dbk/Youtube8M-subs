00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
hi this is dr. young what I'm doing

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.579 
hi this is dr. young what I'm doing
right<00:00:02.850> now<00:00:02.909> is<00:00:03.030> a<00:00:03.149> facelift<00:00:03.750> and<00:00:04.380> what<00:00:04.560> I

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
right now is a facelift and what I

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.160 
right now is a facelift and what I
wanted<00:00:04.859> to<00:00:04.950> show<00:00:05.220> you<00:00:05.390> was<00:00:06.390> to<00:00:06.569> explain<00:00:06.960> the

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
wanted to show you was to explain the

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.980 
wanted to show you was to explain the
little<00:00:07.379> differences<00:00:07.770> between<00:00:07.950> a<00:00:08.099> mini<00:00:08.370> lift

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:08.990 
little differences between a mini lift

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.680 
little differences between a mini lift
and<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:10.559> deep<00:00:11.099> plane<00:00:11.429> left<00:00:11.730> and<00:00:12.059> I<00:00:12.360> wanted<00:00:12.599> to

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
and a deep plane left and I wanted to

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.480 
and a deep plane left and I wanted to
show<00:00:12.870> you<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.080> anatomy<00:00:13.259> it's<00:00:14.250> sort<00:00:14.460> of

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
show you the anatomy it's sort of

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.160 
show you the anatomy it's sort of
important<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:14.880> understand<00:00:15.360> but<00:00:15.570> right<00:00:15.839> here

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
important to understand but right here

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.529 
important to understand but right here
we<00:00:16.980> have<00:00:17.160> this<00:00:17.449> exposed<00:00:18.449> in<00:00:19.320> an<00:00:19.470> incision<00:00:19.920> and

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:20.539 
we have this exposed in an incision and

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.220 
we have this exposed in an incision and
when<00:00:21.539> you<00:00:21.630> do<00:00:21.869> many<00:00:22.560> laughs<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.900> short<00:00:24.900> scar

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
when you do many laughs and short scar

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.419 
when you do many laughs and short scar
lifts<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.830> lot<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.250> that<00:00:26.369> what<00:00:26.609> that<00:00:27.090> entails<00:00:27.750> is

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:28.429 
lifts a lot of that what that entails is

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:30.859 
lifts a lot of that what that entails is
just<00:00:29.429> picking<00:00:29.820> up<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.000> tissue<00:00:30.330> here<00:00:30.750> and

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
just picking up the tissue here and

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.359 
just picking up the tissue here and
pulling<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.260> back<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.800> sewing<00:00:32.160> into

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
pulling it back and sewing into

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.209 
pulling it back and sewing into
something<00:00:32.700> harder<00:00:33.480> or<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.410> solid<00:00:34.920> structure

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
something harder or a solid structure

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:35.870 
something harder or a solid structure
here

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
here

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.139 
here
now<00:00:37.370> what<00:00:38.370> we've<00:00:38.520> done<00:00:38.670> here<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.000> we've

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
now what we've done here is we've

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.040 
now what we've done here is we've
elevated<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.660> skin<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:41.570> the<00:00:42.570> muscle<00:00:42.930> is

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
elevated the skin and the muscle is

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.279 
elevated the skin and the muscle is
underneath<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:44.780> typically<00:00:45.780> when<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:45.989> do<00:00:46.110> s

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
underneath and typically when you do s

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.080 
underneath and typically when you do s
lifts<00:00:46.620> are<00:00:46.710> really<00:00:46.950> quick<00:00:47.250> closer<00:00:47.670> main<00:00:47.850> lifts

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
lifts are really quick closer main lifts

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.600 
lifts are really quick closer main lifts
they<00:00:48.210> entail<00:00:48.649> just<00:00:49.649> taking<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.129> muscle<00:00:50.520> from

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
they entail just taking this muscle from

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.209 
they entail just taking this muscle from
the<00:00:50.700> top<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.360> pulling<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.140> back<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.649> then

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
the top and pulling it back and then

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.600 
the top and pulling it back and then
sewing<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:54.170> that<00:00:55.170> depends<00:00:55.770> on<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.920> lot<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.280> scar

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
sewing it that depends on a lot of scar

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.930 
sewing it that depends on a lot of scar
tissue<00:00:56.930> holding<00:00:57.930> on<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:59.399> elevation

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
tissue holding on to that the elevation

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.290 
tissue holding on to that the elevation
and<00:01:00.449> it's<00:01:01.440> very<00:01:01.800> dependent<00:01:02.100> on<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.520> now<00:01:03.239> the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
and it's very dependent on that now the

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.579 
and it's very dependent on that now the
other<00:01:03.719> way<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.930> do<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.290> more<00:01:04.470> traditional

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
other way to do is a more traditional

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.380 
other way to do is a more traditional
way<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.100> doing<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.489> face<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.850> was<00:01:06.030> actually

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
way of doing the face that was actually

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.480 
way of doing the face that was actually
elevating<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.020> muscle<00:01:07.380> which<00:01:08.159> you've<00:01:08.310> done

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
elevating the muscle which you've done

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.510 
elevating the muscle which you've done
here<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.119> can<00:01:09.659> kind<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.960> see<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.260> muscle

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.070 

right<00:01:14.520> here<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.330> we're<00:01:15.540> underneath<00:01:15.869> the

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
right here and we're underneath the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.840 
right here and we're underneath the
muscle<00:01:16.380> here<00:01:16.530> here's<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.040> parotid<00:01:17.490> gland<00:01:17.729> and

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
muscle here here's the parotid gland and

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.179 
muscle here here's the parotid gland and
we're<00:01:18.600> going<00:01:18.840> straight<00:01:19.290> into<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:19.770> area<00:01:20.100> and

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
we're going straight into this area and

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.380 
we're going straight into this area and
then<00:01:20.280> we're<00:01:20.430> also<00:01:20.520> going<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.790> develop<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.180> plane

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
then we're also going to develop a plane

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.609 
then we're also going to develop a plane
over<00:01:21.630> here<00:01:21.659> but<00:01:22.049> at<00:01:22.140> least<00:01:22.259> all<00:01:22.500> the

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
over here but at least all the

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.840 
over here but at least all the
structures<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.570> really<00:01:24.570> allow<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.850> face

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
structures and really allow the face

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.420 
structures and really allow the face
here<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.600> be<00:01:27.720> released<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.409> really<00:01:29.130> pulled

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
here to be released and really pulled

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.760 
here to be released and really pulled
and<00:01:29.640> resect<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:31.049> so<00:01:31.229> that's<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.650> difference

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
and resect and so that's the difference

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.690 
and resect and so that's the difference
between<00:01:32.159> these<00:01:33.060> quicker<00:01:33.799> lifts<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:35.340> entail

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
between these quicker lifts that entail

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.969 
between these quicker lifts that entail
just<00:01:35.939> pulling<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.329> tissues<00:01:36.720> up<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.229> not

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
just pulling the tissues up and not

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.010 
just pulling the tissues up and not
really<00:01:38.450> readjusting<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.570> muscles<00:01:39.900> like

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
really readjusting the muscles like

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.719 
really readjusting the muscles like
we're<00:01:40.200> doing<00:01:40.320> here<00:01:40.470> this<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.369> more<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.640> a

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
we're doing here this is more of a

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.370 
we're doing here this is more of a
complete<00:01:42.090> traditional<00:01:42.570> case<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.930> when<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.200> go

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
complete traditional case of when you go

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.880 
complete traditional case of when you go
underneath<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.130> muscle<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:45.710> mmm

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
underneath the muscle and mmm

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.469 
underneath the muscle and mmm
some<00:01:47.250> people<00:01:47.490> just<00:01:47.520> live<00:01:47.790> in<00:01:47.909> this<00:01:48.000> dissection

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
some people just live in this dissection

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.440 
some people just live in this dissection
at<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:48.899> point<00:01:49.170> but<00:01:49.950> however<00:01:50.159> I<00:01:50.450> will

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
at this point but however I will

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.179 
at this point but however I will
incorporate<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.079> dissection<00:01:52.829> all<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.100> way

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
incorporate the dissection all the way

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.499 
incorporate the dissection all the way
over<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.460> here<00:01:53.610> over<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.970> smiling<00:01:54.390> muscles

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
over to here over the smiling muscles

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.109 
over to here over the smiling muscles
where<00:01:54.899> I'm<00:01:55.020> going<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.350> really<00:01:55.820> pull<00:01:56.820> on<00:01:56.969> the

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
where I'm going to really pull on the

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.730 
where I'm going to really pull on the
face<00:01:57.450> really<00:01:57.780> release<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.290> structures<00:01:58.649> we

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
face really release the structures we
