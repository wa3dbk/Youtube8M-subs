have all the same powers that you had in
crisis<00:01:03.270> one<00:01:03.660> they're<00:01:04.199> all<00:01:04.350> there<00:01:04.589> but<00:01:04.860> their

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
crisis one they're all there but their

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.920 
crisis one they're all there but their
combined<00:01:05.670> already<00:01:06.060> together<00:01:06.299> for<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.810> in

combined already together for you in

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.660 
combined already together for you in
certain<00:01:07.170> way<00:01:07.260> so<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.619> run<00:01:07.890> fast<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.430> jump

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
certain way so you to run fast and jump

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.219 
certain way so you to run fast and jump
we<00:01:08.909> put<00:01:09.090> those<00:01:09.210> together<00:01:09.450> that's<00:01:09.810> on<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.049> base

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
we put those together that's on the base

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.780 
we put those together that's on the base
and<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.409> know<00:01:10.470> suit<00:01:10.710> by<00:01:10.860> default<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.580> still

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
and I know suit by default you still

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.130 
and I know suit by default you still
have<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.000> ability<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.390> cloak<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.930> still

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
have the ability to cloak and you still

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.510 
have the ability to cloak and you still
have<00:01:13.290> armor<00:01:13.590> but<00:01:13.740> then<00:01:13.860> they<00:01:13.950> even<00:01:14.250> those<00:01:14.400> are

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
have armor but then they even those are

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.310 
have armor but then they even those are
expanded<00:01:15.000> further<00:01:15.180> out<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.540> push<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.110> core

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
expanded further out to push the core

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.920 
expanded further out to push the core
away

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.350 

so<00:01:19.930> this<00:01:20.080> is<00:01:20.110> nanosuit<00:01:20.890> so<00:01:21.280> you<00:01:21.640> know<00:01:21.760> beyond

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
so this is nanosuit so you know beyond

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.330 
so this is nanosuit so you know beyond
just<00:01:22.750> stealth<00:01:23.350> when<00:01:23.590> you're<00:01:23.710> when<00:01:23.980> you're<00:01:24.100> in

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
that we're doing in crisis to that

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.640 
that we're doing in crisis to that
wasn't<00:01:31.000> in<00:01:31.060> crisis<00:01:31.420> one<00:01:31.630> is<00:01:31.780> we<00:01:32.230> allow<00:01:32.440> you<00:01:32.500> to

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
wasn't in crisis one is we allow you to

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.980 
wasn't in crisis one is we allow you to
customize<00:01:32.830> the<00:01:33.220> Nanosuit<00:01:33.640> so<00:01:34.150> what<00:01:34.420> we're<00:01:34.600> not

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
customize the Nanosuit so what we're not

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.630 
customize the Nanosuit so what we're not
doing<00:01:35.050> it's<00:01:35.470> not<00:01:35.620> about<00:01:35.800> paint<00:01:36.070> schemes<00:01:36.430> or

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
doing it's not about paint schemes or

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
meaningful changes to the suit so you

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.250 
meaningful changes to the suit so you

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
imagine you have like some modules that

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.780 
imagine you have like some modules that
you<00:01:41.380> can<00:01:41.530> turn<00:01:41.710> on<00:01:41.770> and<00:01:42.070> choose<00:01:42.280> what<00:01:42.640> you're

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
you can turn on and choose what you're

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.820 
you can turn on and choose what you're
doing<00:01:43.090> much<00:01:43.570> in<00:01:43.600> the<00:01:43.870> same<00:01:44.020> way<00:01:44.080> in<00:01:44.320> crisis<00:01:44.650> one

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
doing much in the same way in crisis one

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.320 
doing much in the same way in crisis one
we<00:01:44.950> allow<00:01:45.160> you<00:01:45.220> to<00:01:45.430> customize<00:01:45.610> your<00:01:46.000> weapon

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
we allow you to customize your weapon

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.210 
we allow you to customize your weapon
you<00:01:46.720> can<00:01:46.840> do<00:01:46.960> the<00:01:47.110> same<00:01:47.140> with<00:01:47.410> the<00:01:47.500> nanosuit<00:01:47.950> so

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
you can do the same with the nanosuit so

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.560 
you can do the same with the nanosuit so
when<00:01:48.670> you're<00:01:48.790> if<00:01:48.940> you<00:01:49.030> want<00:01:49.210> to<00:01:49.300> play<00:01:49.420> in<00:01:49.480> a

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
when you're if you want to play in a

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.180 
when you're if you want to play in a
stealthy<00:01:49.930> style<00:01:50.200> you<00:01:50.350> bid<00:01:50.500> stream<00:01:50.800> yeah<00:01:51.130> you

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
stealthy style you bid stream yeah you

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.830 
stealthy style you bid stream yeah you
can<00:01:51.370> change<00:01:51.580> on<00:01:51.730> the<00:01:51.820> fly<00:01:51.850> so<00:01:52.240> what<00:01:52.540> we<00:01:52.660> think

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
can change on the fly so what we think

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.630 
can change on the fly so what we think
players<00:01:53.470> will<00:01:53.740> be<00:01:53.830> doing<00:01:54.100> when<00:01:54.310> they<00:01:54.430> use<00:01:54.550> the

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
players will be doing when they use the

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.130 
players will be doing when they use the
Nanosuit<00:01:55.000> this<00:01:55.150> time<00:01:55.300> around<00:01:55.390> is<00:01:55.690> they'll

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
Nanosuit this time around is they'll

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.020 
Nanosuit this time around is they'll
look<00:01:56.500> at<00:01:56.650> the<00:01:56.740> gaming<00:01:57.250> landscape<00:01:57.550> you<00:01:57.940> know

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
look at the gaming landscape you know

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.090 
look at the gaming landscape you know
the<00:01:58.150> area<00:01:58.600> that<00:01:58.750> that<00:01:58.990> the<00:01:59.530> enemies<00:01:59.830> are<00:01:59.860> in

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
the area that that the enemies are in

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.770 
the area that that the enemies are in
and<00:02:00.340> then<00:02:00.760> much<00:02:00.940> like<00:02:01.150> in<00:02:01.270> this<00:02:01.360> in<00:02:01.660> the

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
and then much like in this in the

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.240 
and then much like in this in the
original<00:02:01.930> crisis<00:02:02.470> some<00:02:02.590> people<00:02:02.830> would<00:02:02.950> change

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
original crisis some people would change

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.070 
original crisis some people would change
like<00:02:03.790> put<00:02:03.910> a<00:02:03.970> grenade<00:02:04.210> launcher<00:02:04.510> on<00:02:04.570> or<00:02:04.900> change

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
like put a grenade launcher on or change

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.480 
like put a grenade launcher on or change
the<00:02:05.230> scope<00:02:05.500> or<00:02:05.710> something<00:02:06.010> like<00:02:06.130> this<00:02:06.280> to

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
the scope or something like this to

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.950 
the scope or something like this to
change<00:02:06.700> their<00:02:06.850> weapon<00:02:07.150> they'll<00:02:07.570> look<00:02:07.690> at<00:02:07.840> the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
change their weapon they'll look at the

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.660 
change their weapon they'll look at the
same<00:02:08.170> problem<00:02:08.380> and<00:02:08.740> go<00:02:08.860> okay<00:02:09.160> well<00:02:09.340> how<00:02:09.460> can<00:02:09.610> i

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
same problem and go okay well how can i

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.250 
same problem and go okay well how can i
optimize<00:02:09.940> the<00:02:10.179> nanosuit<00:02:10.600> to<00:02:10.840> do<00:02:10.990> the<00:02:11.110> same

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
optimize the nanosuit to do the same

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.470 
optimize the nanosuit to do the same
thing<00:02:11.500> like<00:02:12.010> a<00:02:12.040> sneaky<00:02:12.460> guy<00:02:12.610> and<00:02:12.850> sneak<00:02:13.360> around

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
and stab people in the back and play you

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.970 
and stab people in the back and play you
more<00:02:16.270> like<00:02:16.420> a<00:02:16.450> ninja<00:02:16.900> or<00:02:17.140> a<00:02:17.200> silent<00:02:17.590> killer<00:02:17.710> um

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
more like a ninja or a silent killer um

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.040 
more like a ninja or a silent killer um
you<00:02:18.430> can<00:02:18.580> you<00:02:18.880> can<00:02:19.030> play<00:02:19.180> that<00:02:19.360> way<00:02:19.540> but<00:02:19.870> if<00:02:19.990> you

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
you can you can play that way but if you

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.750 
you can you can play that way but if you
want<00:02:20.230> to<00:02:20.290> jump<00:02:20.470> right<00:02:20.560> into<00:02:20.860> huge<00:02:21.220> action<00:02:21.610> and

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
want to jump right into huge action and

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.310 
want to jump right into huge action and
have<00:02:21.880> grenades<00:02:22.120> and<00:02:22.420> rockets<00:02:22.780> and<00:02:22.930> explosions

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
then you can do that as well so you can

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.640 
then you can do that as well so you can
have<00:02:28.360> a<00:02:28.390> lot<00:02:28.540> of<00:02:28.570> vertical<00:02:28.840> gameplay<00:02:29.410> in<00:02:29.560> the

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
have a lot of vertical gameplay in the

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.530 
have a lot of vertical gameplay in the
skin<00:02:29.860> um<00:02:30.310> it<00:02:30.610> would<00:02:30.700> be<00:02:30.820> a<00:02:30.850> boring<00:02:31.120> thing<00:02:31.360> to<00:02:31.450> be

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
skin um it would be a boring thing to be

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.580 
skin um it would be a boring thing to be
there<00:02:31.660> wouldn't<00:02:31.840> be<00:02:31.900> much<00:02:32.020> interesting

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
there wouldn't be much interesting

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.610 
there wouldn't be much interesting
things<00:02:33.070> to<00:02:33.220> do<00:02:33.340> but<00:02:33.880> what<00:02:34.150> you<00:02:34.239> can<00:02:34.450> do<00:02:34.660> is<00:02:34.900> you

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
things to do but what you can do is you

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:36.840 
things to do but what you can do is you
know<00:02:35.709> within<00:02:35.890> a<00:02:36.010> game<00:02:36.130> play<00:02:36.310> space<00:02:36.550> because

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
know within a game play space because

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.280 
know within a game play space because
the<00:02:37.000> suit<00:02:37.209> is<00:02:37.330> so<00:02:37.450> powerful<00:02:37.630> you<00:02:38.020> can

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
the suit is so powerful you can

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.960 
the suit is so powerful you can
basically<00:02:38.620> move<00:02:39.070> up<00:02:39.250> and<00:02:39.370> down<00:02:39.430> one<00:02:39.760> or<00:02:39.850> two

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
basically move up and down one or two

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.910 
basically move up and down one or two
stories<00:02:40.270> quite<00:02:40.450> easily<00:02:40.690> so<00:02:40.900> you<00:02:41.500> can<00:02:41.650> jump<00:02:41.800> on

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
stories quite easily so you can jump on

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.140 
stories quite easily so you can jump on
top<00:02:42.040> of<00:02:42.100> trucks<00:02:42.489> and<00:02:42.640> then<00:02:42.790> jump<00:02:42.940> from<00:02:43.060> the

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150

guys gonna be modeling you know Times
Square<00:03:26.650> I<00:03:26.680> mean<00:03:26.980> are<00:03:27.070> gonna<00:03:27.190> recognize

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
Square I mean are gonna recognize

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.280 
Square I mean are gonna recognize
location<00:03:28.150> and<00:03:28.270> I<00:03:28.330> can<00:03:28.450> go<00:03:28.540> and<00:03:28.780> that<00:03:28.930> doesn't

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
location and I can go and that doesn't

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.020 
location and I can go and that doesn't
look<00:03:29.410> exactly<00:03:29.590> like<00:03:30.010> it<00:03:30.310> but<00:03:30.520> there's<00:03:30.790> a<00:03:30.880> lot

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
look exactly like it but there's a lot

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
look exactly like it but there's a lot
of<00:03:31.060> reasons<00:03:31.420> why<00:03:31.540> I<00:03:31.570> mean<00:03:31.780> it's<00:03:31.930> very

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
of reasons why I mean it's very

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.540 
of reasons why I mean it's very
difficult<00:03:32.320> to<00:03:32.590> make<00:03:32.770> a<00:03:32.800> one-to-one

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
difficult to make a one-to-one

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:34.980 
difficult to make a one-to-one
representation<00:03:34.240> just<00:03:34.420> from<00:03:34.570> a<00:03:34.600> legal<00:03:34.780> point

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990 
representation just from a legal point

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.800 
representation just from a legal point
of<00:03:35.110> view<00:03:35.460> what<00:03:36.460> we<00:03:36.580> have<00:03:36.760> done<00:03:36.940> is<00:03:37.120> replicated

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
of view what we have done is replicated

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.900 
of view what we have done is replicated
each<00:03:37.930> location<00:03:38.260> very<00:03:38.920> very<00:03:39.160> closely<00:03:39.430> as<00:03:39.700> far

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
each location very very closely as far

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.150 
each location very very closely as far
as<00:03:40.030> size<00:03:40.240> footprint<00:03:40.780> feel<00:03:41.170> I<00:03:41.440> mean<00:03:41.620> it'd<00:03:42.040> be

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
as size footprint feel I mean it'd be

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.580 
as size footprint feel I mean it'd be
hard<00:03:42.400> pressed<00:03:42.580> for<00:03:42.910> you<00:03:43.030> not<00:03:43.360> to<00:03:43.630> feel<00:03:44.380> like

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
hard pressed for you not to feel like

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.230 
hard pressed for you not to feel like

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
or is it more segmented um it's

or is it more segmented um it's
segmented<00:03:51.610> much<00:03:51.820> in<00:03:51.940> the<00:03:52.030> way<00:03:52.060> crisis<00:03:52.540> one<00:03:52.720> was

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930
