00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
in here there's one right here and one

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.139 
in here there's one right here and one
right<00:00:54.930> here<00:00:55.469> that's<00:00:56.160> your<00:00:56.309> high<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.550> low<00:00:56.760> gear

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
right here that's your high and low gear

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.119 
right here that's your high and low gear
settings<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.989> what<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.590> does<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:58.920> there's<00:00:59.070> a

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
settings and what it does is there's a

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.650 
settings and what it does is there's a
bearing<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.730> presses<00:01:00.090> against<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.570> and

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
bearing that presses against that and

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.000 
bearing that presses against that and
locks<00:01:00.899> in<00:01:01.079> place<00:01:01.260> so<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.559> doesn't<00:01:01.590> come<00:01:01.920> out

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
locks in place so it doesn't come out

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.959 
locks in place so it doesn't come out
while<00:01:02.219> you're<00:01:02.340> driving

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
while you're driving

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.850 
while you're driving
well<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.480> found<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.110> gets<00:01:04.290> very<00:01:04.500> dirty

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
well I found that that gets very dirty

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.410 
well I found that that gets very dirty
and<00:01:04.979> then<00:01:05.129> also<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.519> locks<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.909> one<00:01:06.150> gear<00:01:06.390> and

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
and then also it locks you one gear and

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.380 
and then also it locks you one gear and
you<00:01:06.600> can't<00:01:06.840> switch<00:01:07.110> between<00:01:07.320> them<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:08.490> this<00:01:09.240> is

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
you can't switch between them so this is

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.920 
you can't switch between them so this is
how<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.570> fix<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:10.049> very<00:01:10.409> quickly<00:01:10.760> I<00:01:11.930> made

down<00:01:43.399> and<00:01:44.399> now<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.299> can<00:01:45.509> see<00:01:45.659> kind<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:45.960> the

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
down and now you can see kind of the

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.389 
down and now you can see kind of the
spring<00:01:46.350> showing<00:01:46.799> there<00:01:46.950> it's<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.159> little

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
spring showing there it's a little

I'm going to use a small small glasses
screwdriver<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.540> pop<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:54.869> out<00:01:54.960> there<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.909> so

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
screwdriver to pop it out there it is so

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.240 
screwdriver to pop it out there it is so
there's<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.299> little<00:01:57.420> spring<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.380> then

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
there's the little spring and then

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.770 
there's the little spring and then
inside<00:01:59.549> here<00:01:59.610> is<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.880> bearing<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.479> haven't

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
inside here is a bearing that I haven't

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.709 
inside here is a bearing that I haven't
been<00:02:00.869> able<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.110> get<00:02:01.229> out<00:02:01.460> but<00:02:02.460> at<00:02:02.700> songs<00:02:03.299> I'm

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
been able to get out but at songs I'm

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:04.880 
been able to get out but at songs I'm
going<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.899> zoom<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.140> doesn't<00:02:04.439> come<00:02:04.560> out<00:02:04.680> and

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
going to zoom it doesn't come out and

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.380 
going to zoom it doesn't come out and
what<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.070> do<00:02:05.189> is<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:05.520> sit<00:02:05.759> here<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.060> move<00:02:06.210> the

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
what I do is I sit here and I move the

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.770 
what I do is I sit here and I move the
bearing<00:02:06.750> around<00:02:07.049> with<00:02:07.799> my<00:02:07.920> little<00:02:08.069> tool<00:02:08.310> add

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
bearing around with my little tool add

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.559 
bearing around with my little tool add
some<00:02:09.780> oil<00:02:09.989> on<00:02:10.259> both<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.560> front

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
some oil on both the front

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.670 
some oil on both the front
and<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:12.860> backend<00:02:13.329> okay<00:02:14.329> put<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.319> spring<00:02:15.650> back

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
and the backend okay put the spring back

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:22.179 
and the backend okay put the spring back
in<00:02:16.239> and<00:02:17.349> then<00:02:18.349> simply<00:02:18.709> tighten<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:19.129> screw<00:02:21.189> you

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:22.189 
in and then simply tighten the screw you

in and then simply tighten the screw you
tighten<00:02:22.459> the<00:02:22.519> screw<00:02:22.760> up<00:02:22.819> now<00:02:22.849> you<00:02:23.689> can<00:02:23.870> make

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
tighten the screw up now you can make

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:25.390 
tighten the screw up now you can make
this<00:02:24.200> go<00:02:24.379> as<00:02:24.500> tight<00:02:24.769> as<00:02:24.950> you<00:02:24.980> want<00:02:25.099> depending

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
this go as tight as you want depending

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.490 
this go as tight as you want depending
on<00:02:25.640> how<00:02:25.790> hard<00:02:26.120> you<00:02:26.329> want<00:02:26.480> it<00:02:26.659> to<00:02:26.750> lock<00:02:26.959> against

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
on how hard you want it to lock against

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.429 
on how hard you want it to lock against
this<00:02:27.620> pin<00:02:28.510> okay<00:02:29.510> couple<00:02:29.750> of<00:02:29.900> turns<00:02:30.170> because

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:30.439 
this pin okay couple of turns because

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:31.690 
this pin okay couple of turns because
you<00:02:30.590> want<00:02:30.739> it<00:02:30.769> to<00:02:30.829> have<00:02:30.980> some<00:02:31.010> movement<00:02:31.370> you

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
you want it to have some movement you

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.580 
you want it to have some movement you
can<00:02:31.819> also<00:02:32.000> make<00:02:32.390> your<00:02:32.569> gears<00:02:32.870> tighter<00:02:33.290> to

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
can also make your gears tighter to

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.559 
can also make your gears tighter to
tighter<00:02:33.829> you<00:02:34.040> make<00:02:34.220> it<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:34.970> harder<00:02:35.329> it<00:02:35.420> is<00:02:35.510> to

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
tighter you make it the harder it is to

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.089 
tighter you make it the harder it is to
move<00:02:35.840> that<00:02:36.049> bearing<00:02:36.470> back<00:02:36.620> in<00:02:36.829> because<00:02:37.010> all

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
move that bearing back in because all

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:38.140 
move that bearing back in because all
that's<00:02:37.250> happening<00:02:37.549> is<00:02:37.609> that<00:02:37.730> bearing<00:02:38.060> is

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
that's happening is that bearing is

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.640 
that's happening is that bearing is
coming<00:02:38.480> in<00:02:38.599> like<00:02:38.750> this<00:02:38.989> as<00:02:39.260> you're<00:02:39.439> switching

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
coming in like this as you're switching

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.920 
coming in like this as you're switching
gears<00:02:40.040> to<00:02:40.220> hold<00:02:40.370> it<00:02:40.489> in<00:02:40.579> place<00:02:40.730> so<00:02:41.180> if<00:02:41.719> you<00:02:41.780> make

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
gears to hold it in place so if you make

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.360 
gears to hold it in place so if you make
it<00:02:42.079> tighter<00:02:42.349> it's<00:02:42.590> going<00:02:42.739> to<00:02:42.799> push<00:02:42.980> harder

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
it tighter it's going to push harder

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.729 
it tighter it's going to push harder
making<00:02:43.639> it<00:02:43.760> you<00:02:44.150> know<00:02:44.269> making<00:02:44.629> it<00:02:44.840> easy<00:02:45.019> lock

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
making it you know making it easy lock

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.649 
making it you know making it easy lock
in<00:02:46.040> place<00:02:46.280> or<00:02:46.579> soften<00:02:47.090> it<00:02:47.180> so<00:02:47.269> it<00:02:47.359> changes

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:47.659 
in place or soften it so it changes

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:50.199 
in place or soften it so it changes
easier<00:02:48.400> alright<00:02:49.400> now<00:02:49.549> that<00:02:49.609> I've<00:02:49.819> put<00:02:49.970> it<00:02:50.060> back

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
easier alright now that I've put it back

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:51.909 
easier alright now that I've put it back
together<00:02:50.389> here's<00:02:50.930> that<00:02:51.109> piece<00:02:51.319> one<00:02:51.500> more<00:02:51.680> time

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:51.919 
together here's that piece one more time

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:54.309 
together here's that piece one more time
I<00:02:52.489> just<00:02:53.060> very<00:02:53.209> simply<00:02:53.629> all<00:02:53.750> I<00:02:53.870> did<00:02:54.139> was<00:02:54.290> just

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
fix it so that way that piece the

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.929 
fix it so that way that piece the
shifter<00:02:57.260> right<00:02:57.409> there<00:02:57.709> in<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.370> center<00:02:58.549> screen

00:02:58.929 --> 00:02:58.939 
shifter right there in the center screen

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:01.420 
shifter right there in the center screen
just<00:02:59.299> moves<00:02:59.540> in<00:02:59.629> and<00:02:59.780> out<00:02:59.840> easier<00:03:00.079> my<00:03:01.040> tripod

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
just moves in and out easier my tripod

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.000 
just moves in and out easier my tripod
got<00:03:01.669> damaged<00:03:02.030> so<00:03:02.349> right<00:03:03.349> now<00:03:03.470> I<00:03:03.500> can't<00:03:03.739> show
