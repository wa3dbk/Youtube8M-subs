00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.200
 moin together and welcome 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.330
 today I have a whole swing 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.030
 new textiles for you and it's about 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.680
 the nike textiles for spring 2015 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.539
 and I find them quite managed it 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.460
 look very stylish very fresh and very 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.529
 fashionable from jumping we generated 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.300
 Of course you never travel at nike 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.560
 to the superstar it over in the fall 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.270
 Roger Federer here 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.039
 Personally, I find that very much 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.489
 I succeeded in cooking the shoe 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:35.199
 already that is the super 9.5 do here 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.780
 again in the new color and hear 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:39.460
 on the name of volt if you're there for 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.899
 wanted to have a suitable chance for example 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.789
 and you will notice the color volt is going down 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:43.539
 Pulling through a bit gives this 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:44.799
 chance here 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:46.569
 I personally see nothing so a bit 

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:49.239
 something like a tribute to the old 

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:50.739
 textiles android apps like eg also 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.690
 always short and it was so 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.309
 a compression short is natural 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.049
 also a trend among the professionals meanwhile 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.239
 so here's a very consistent 

00:00:56.049 --> 00:01:00.280
 Stepped that both were sewn 1 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.260
 but who, for example, completely normal 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.760
 traditional normal already over it and 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.710
 still have the compression shirt 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.920
 that's exactly what he wants here 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.080
 is the combination from the nike meat place 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.090
 and the nike pro core compression short 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.950
 Let's come to a series of new ones 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.360
 top and look at the first 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.150
 I felt reminded of 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.650
 In 2009 I think it was Raphael Nadal 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.270
 starting with long poor ones too 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.700
 At that time, they also played first at the 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.380
 austrian open and here now colored 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.440
 something ajar we have three variants 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.150
 the blessed goal is another very 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.010
 stylish top maybe something 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.410
 for training or of course for 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.690
 The leisure time that she is tending 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.160
 contender graffiti like the imprint 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.830
 already says exactly the right thing for everyone 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.540
 tennis crazy actually and like you 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.530
 See is synonymous with the ladies very much 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.300
 colorful this color stops on pink and 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.130
 the contender graphics inc 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.409
 there with us in two colors one time 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.870
 just in this pink and then in the 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.930
 I personally think that forest is very good 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:02.380
 Can be combined with this is printed 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.750
 capri also combined times or synonymous 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.700
 new for all women the fan of it 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.930
 are not very long to play me 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.979
 but still a bit warmer too 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.319
 then I can recommend this 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.049
 heard on the name baseline three quarters 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.670
 sleeve top and you see it here too 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:19.209

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.709

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.849
 Last but not least who have it all together 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.470

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.239

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.989
