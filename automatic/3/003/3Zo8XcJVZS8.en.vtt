00:00:01.609 --> 00:00:02.960
Hydrogen is one of the lighest ...

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.330
... and one of the most abundant elements in the world.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.409
Since it is not possible to find it in free form ...

00:00:08.409 --> 00:00:09.999
... in order to produce pure hydrogen ...

00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:11.419
... out of its natural form,...

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:14.259
...different production methods are needed.

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:18.669
One of these methods is electrolysis of the water.

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:22.429
Electrolyzers are the devices which decomposes water into hydrogen and oxygen ...

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:25.179
... by using electricity.

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:29.019
Their working principle is reverse of the fuel cells.

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:31.399
Except the the fact that reactions work in reverse direction...

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:35.130
... all simple theories and the reaction on the electrodes are same ...

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.910
... for fuel cells and electrolyzers.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.640
There are two types of widely used electrolyzers.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.290
PEM electrolyzers and alkali electrolyzers.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.410
Recently, thanks to being more compact and durable,  ...

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.900
...having higher efficiency and lower maintenance costs...

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.720
PEM electrolyzers are frequently preferred over their counterparts.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.990
PEM electrolyzers have a...

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.000
... proton permeable membrane,  ...

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.300
... an anode layer where water decomposes and...

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.920
... oxygen forms, 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.030
an catalyst layer where hidrojenin forms and...

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.300
...electrode layers where electic is applied and ...

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.310
... gases and liquids transferred to and removed from...

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.760
... catalyst surfaces.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:36.600
Water enters to electrolyzer cell and water is oxydized by an elektrochemical reaction. 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.450
Thus, oxygen gas, positive hydrogen ion and free electrons are produced.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.259
In cathode side, hydrogen ions that pass through membrane...

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:51.290
... incorporates with externally provided electrons and form hydrogen gas.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.200
As you see in this device here, ...

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.700
...the hydrogen is being produced in electrolyzer.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.480
... Hydrogen goes out from here.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.670
Here, Water enters to the system.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.759
Hydrogen is stored in the tank... 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.439
...and when needed hydrogen is transferred from here...

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:20.039
... to the PEM fuel cell.

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:21.819
Finally,in the PEM fuel cell, hydrogen and the oxygen reacts

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.819
... and the electricity is produced.
