not working at all so I'm going to stick
with<00:02:07.000> my<00:02:07.479> old<00:02:07.630> play<00:02:08.170> format<00:02:09.330> so<00:02:16.200> back<00:02:17.200> one<00:02:17.500> safe

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:30.150 

backwards<00:02:21.569> forwards<00:02:24.270> double<00:02:25.270> click<00:02:25.360> and<00:02:29.160> so

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
backwards forwards double click and so

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.910 
backwards forwards double click and so
that's<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.700> first<00:02:31.209> epi<00:02:31.870> setting<00:02:33.120> second

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
that's the first epi setting second

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.610

kind<00:02:42.370> of<00:02:42.519> for<00:02:42.880> accuracy<00:02:43.390> while<00:02:43.690> gaming<00:02:45.060> so<00:02:47.220> you

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
kind of for accuracy while gaming so you

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:56.900 
kind of for accuracy while gaming so you
never<00:02:48.370> setting<00:02:50.310> 800-1200<00:02:52.620> 1602<00:02:53.620> thousand<00:02:54.989> so

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
never setting 800-1200 1602 thousand so

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.310
