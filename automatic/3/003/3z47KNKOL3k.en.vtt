00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.830
 for those of youtube bring the review 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:08.920
 official of this or there is no matrix that 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.750
 it's called texas ultimate value and it's the 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.690
 name of the toy but to a series of 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.150
 ultimate health and good matrix in 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:19.390
 truth I never did this a review 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:24.429
 official why I decided to make him 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:28.080
 now they told me everything that is between 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:33.740
 may be the first thing he does is 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.740
 many options but not 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.980
 around him 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.350
 we can see it well but here it gives us a 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.050
 hollow this what I did not like I do not know 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.879
 I see very simple and at the same time the strap that 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.980
 we can see it the corneas you can leave 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:54.370
 because he's going to take it from me because I do not want to 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:57.480
 pull out and peron like that the strap too 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.480
 a little cheap 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.280
 a little bit small since I do not know 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:08.270
 we are going to touch well better advertising without 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.310
 But now it has been with colors like 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.490
 extra and black but I really know 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.620
 move so I do not have any left 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.510
 but although I do not see myself how 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:21.470
 we can put it more closely 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:23.120
 here as it moves and then more a 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.250
 special thing you parted one and three 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:29.630
 favorites to show how are the 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.310
 tubes on the black background also this in 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.619
 the series general the breaths so that 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.140
 know this thing you can not turn everything 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.210
 the direct impact either this town 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.340
 look at this is also for something special 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.930
 of clarito but show you that a 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.729
 hollow also for something that destined to 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.440
 show before passing functions 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.570
 special functions I want to teach you 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.640
 the discs closer to your discs 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.299
 they contain aliens 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.640
 and this is the 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:59.480
 let's correct handle without sir for 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.550
 back and we put a little bit of the two 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.390
 and we can see what like you have 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.390
 man shape 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.390
 you can not see too 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.990
 with everything as you can see us well but 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.990
 how 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:28.450
 and here 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.450
 ultimate 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.010
 ah 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.010
 I really do not think 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:52.070
 and it's so big and so easy to break 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.350
 one that attends a process in which 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.880
 you have two options you can create disks and 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:01.490
 It can be the same I'll show you 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:03.980
 first the first one is a bit hard for 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:06.590
 put it in and you have to click now 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.820
 to launch this album as you can see and 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:13.400
 we need to crush this and move it like this 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.440
 on the right but it 's kind of hard 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:19.060
 that's why you need to have a bit of 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.060
 proven work force 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.230
 it does not make you see it 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.280
 again 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.280
 it's a bit hard 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.270
 two 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.880
 rob was a bit hard and does not jump so high 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:44.160
 but a good amount and just put 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:46.440
 the other to be done aside 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.270
 I remember when these discs are 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.550
 compatible with the doses is a disc 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.959
 it's not for one of the strangers all 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.810
 these are universal for these 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:58.290
 functions and now let's put your face 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:02.300
 and a little bit too but he was strong and 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.300
 look and boats 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.810
 I live at the speed 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.610
 two 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.610
 without citing them dancing 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:23.600
 how could they see the two functions the 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.600
 Same time 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:31.590
 here they saw two discs in time and 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:35.130
 they are going to beat 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.130
 a little bit hard 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.050
 without more taking things 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.650
 that they could come 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.650
 all right 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:05:01.570
 because when one is a little stronger 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.570
 it was to move it 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.940
 battaglia lately 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.870
 and goodbye
