00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 very good hernandez and that you are heard 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.220
 is well come to the channel and welcome 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.020
 to a new video of blond pokemon mecca and 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.490
 alpha sapphire and good guys is that day 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.290
 today has given a lot to talk about in 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.599
 regarding these editions since we have 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.219
 discovered enough things because of a 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.710
 gameplay that has leaked good that 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.210
 really filter the Japanese official website 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.770
 of pokemon in this video because 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.180
 saying it has not been uploaded to youtube by 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.490
 the pokemon channel but we can 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.769
 see on the Japanese website the truth that 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.930
 good in spite of being a game that has 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.490
 a more or less global exit what 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.529
 this is something quite strange because 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.969
 they are putting content on the web 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.290
 Japanese who is not dying on the web 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.719
 to American in the European which is 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.340
 quite strange but good anyway 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.809
 to it the first thing that the 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.579
 video as you are watching below 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.290
 on the screen is the record of a pokémon 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.329
 in the pokédex that this time is a zigzag 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.309
 we can also see 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.129
 enough changes in the phenomenon of 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.050
 evolution since good then here as 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.050
 see also changes in the environment as 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.030
 good is still going a set of 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.160
 flashes and lights and even not and the 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.070
 pokemon change color too one thing 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.719
 that was in pokemon xy but not 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.630
 was in the additions of ruby ​​sapphire 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.280
 is that we will continue to gain experience 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.930
 for every wild pokemon we caught 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.549
 so it 's pretty good 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.770
 also also about everything we see 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.320
 they are a gameplay with the bike, not in the 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.360
 bike dade good for both bike race 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.210
 as with the acrobatic bike and so 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.310
 we can see, so to speak, its use 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.320
 we see how, for example, he is making a 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.000
 horse on the bike and acrobatic 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.310
 which is quite entertaining after 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.829
 how it goes up and how it crosses obstacles 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.619
 you can only cross with the bike or with 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.479
 the acrobatic bike for example the 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.539
 these points that there are in going for lava 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.770
 caldas in fine and all this that only 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.689
 you can cross over there on the bike 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.220
 acrobatic and we also see a play of 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.020
 the race bike that tells us that it serves 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.479
 so much to move at great speed 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.799
 like to climb sand slopes and 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.599
 good also comes out of the typical 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.640
 little jumps we could give if we had 

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:54.959
 press the b button so nothing guys 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.119
 this has been all that leaks out of 

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:58.649
 today possible good post to 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.090
 continuation of need integral play 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.950
 but but since it was not very good 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.679
 quality you will have put a combat of 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.209
 pokemon xy background for good for 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:07.619
 make it all a bit more enjoyable and 

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:09.420
 now then you are going to have the 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.709
 trailer or you have had it and in order not 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.000
