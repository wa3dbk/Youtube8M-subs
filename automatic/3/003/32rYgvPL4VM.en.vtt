00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
guess how huge it is inside it's not so

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.370

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:23.350 
adventures maybe this is just the ground

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:32.540 
adventures maybe this is just the ground
floor

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.279 

it's<00:06:33.030> kind<00:06:33.210> of<00:06:33.240> like<00:06:33.389> finding<00:06:33.630> a<00:06:33.840> needle<00:06:33.870> in<00:06:34.229> a

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:34.289 
it's kind of like finding a needle in a

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:37.370 
it's kind of like finding a needle in a
haystack<00:06:34.470> but<00:06:35.190> in<00:06:35.430> a<00:06:35.490> cool<00:06:35.699> way<00:06:36.139> we<00:06:37.139> have<00:06:37.229> a<00:06:37.259> lot

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:37.380 
haystack but in a cool way we have a lot

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.860 
haystack but in a cool way we have a lot
of<00:06:37.440> like<00:06:37.770> Chinese<00:06:38.130> type<00:06:38.819> furniture<00:06:39.389> and<00:06:39.750> then

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:39.870 
of like Chinese type furniture and then

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:44.659 
of like Chinese type furniture and then
just<00:06:40.139> really<00:06:40.349> interesting<00:06:40.979> looking<00:06:41.970> wood<00:06:43.669> we

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:44.669 
just really interesting looking wood we

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:46.879 
just really interesting looking wood we
just<00:06:44.940> came<00:06:45.090> out<00:06:45.389> of<00:06:45.780> the<00:06:46.050> antiques<00:06:46.440> market

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:46.889 
just came out of the antiques market

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:48.860 
just came out of the antiques market
store<00:06:47.160> it<00:06:47.340> was<00:06:47.520> pretty<00:06:47.940> disappointing<00:06:48.569> I

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:48.870 
store it was pretty disappointing I

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.439 
store it was pretty disappointing I
think<00:06:49.440> their<00:06:49.560> prices<00:06:50.039> have<00:06:50.310> gone<00:06:50.550> up<00:06:50.849> since

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:51.449 
think their prices have gone up since

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:54.260 
think their prices have gone up since
last<00:06:51.810> time<00:06:52.139> and<00:06:52.440> it<00:06:52.530> has<00:06:52.710> been<00:06:53.009> almost<00:06:53.819> 2<00:06:54.240> years

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:54.270 
last time and it has been almost 2 years

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.480 
last time and it has been almost 2 years
so<00:06:54.750> I<00:06:54.810> guess<00:06:55.050> to<00:06:55.199> some<00:06:55.440> extent<00:06:55.830> that's<00:06:55.919> not<00:06:56.250> the

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:56.490 
so I guess to some extent that's not the

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:58.550 
so I guess to some extent that's not the
super<00:06:56.789> surprise<00:06:57.000> but<00:06:57.660> there<00:06:58.169> just<00:06:58.380> was

00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 
super surprise but there just was

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.290 
super surprise but there just was
nothing<00:06:58.740> like<00:06:59.310> what<00:06:59.490> I<00:06:59.520> was<00:06:59.699> looking<00:07:00.060> for

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:00.300 
nothing like what I was looking for

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.700 
nothing like what I was looking for
which<00:07:00.539> is<00:07:00.690> a<00:07:00.720> smaller<00:07:01.110> piece<00:07:01.380> of<00:07:01.530> furniture

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:01.710 
which is a smaller piece of furniture

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:05.120 
which is a smaller piece of furniture
with<00:07:02.220> a<00:07:02.250> good<00:07:02.520> amount<00:07:02.789> of<00:07:02.849> storage<00:07:03.979> so<00:07:04.979> we're

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.130 
with a good amount of storage so we're

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:07.100 
with a good amount of storage so we're
