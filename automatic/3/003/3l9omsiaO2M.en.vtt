we're gonna sort of butterfly them so

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.800 
we're gonna sort of butterfly them so
this<00:02:53.069> is<00:02:53.190> how<00:02:53.340> you<00:02:53.400> do<00:02:53.640> it<00:02:53.670> using<00:02:54.390> a<00:02:54.480> sharp

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
this is how you do it using a sharp

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.990 
this is how you do it using a sharp
knife<00:02:54.870> on<00:02:55.709> the<00:02:55.860> breast<00:02:56.160> size<00:02:56.490> of<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.700> chicken

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
knife on the breast size of the chicken

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.160 
knife on the breast size of the chicken
you<00:02:57.060> want<00:02:57.150> to<00:02:57.240> just<00:02:57.420> slice<00:02:57.720> down<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:58.020> middle

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
you want to just slice down the middle

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.620 
you want to just slice down the middle
until<00:02:58.560> you<00:02:58.770> reach<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.190> bone<00:02:59.430> you<00:03:00.300> can<00:03:00.450> chop

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
until you reach the bone you can chop

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.000 
until you reach the bone you can chop
off<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:00.959> neck<00:03:01.110> too<00:03:01.350> I<00:03:01.380> think<00:03:01.560> we'll<00:03:01.830> cook<00:03:01.980> that

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
off the neck too I think we'll cook that

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.030 
off the neck too I think we'll cook that
separately<00:03:02.670> so<00:03:02.820> it<00:03:02.910> doesn't<00:03:03.150> get<00:03:03.240> in<00:03:03.330> the<00:03:03.360> way

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
separately so it doesn't get in the way

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.960 
separately so it doesn't get in the way
like<00:03:05.040> try<00:03:05.489> to<00:03:05.550> flatten<00:03:05.940> it<00:03:06.090> out<00:03:07.790> break<00:03:08.790> the
