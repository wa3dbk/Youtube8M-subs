 words I found in the dictionary are 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.900
 so this gospel dick that 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.909
 It is incredible that it looks like it is 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.560
 here in the new testament 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.930

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.890

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.110
 I find them all drunk and nobody 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.009
 thirst causes great pain in my 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.049
 heart 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.829

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.750
 they do not see their own misery 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.860
 content that is in the gospel of 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.159
