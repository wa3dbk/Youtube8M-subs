all right I just finished my window farm
set<00:00:05.230> up<00:00:05.380> last<00:00:05.860> night<00:00:06.120> so<00:00:07.120> I<00:00:07.150> thought<00:00:07.300> I'd<00:00:07.420> give

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:07.600 
set up last night so I thought I'd give

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.200 
set up last night so I thought I'd give
you<00:00:07.630> guys<00:00:07.810> a<00:00:07.840> little<00:00:07.960> peek<00:00:08.280> it<00:00:09.280> is<00:00:09.400> for<00:00:09.850> bottles

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:10.210 
you guys a little peek it is for bottles

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.420 
you guys a little peek it is for bottles
it's<00:00:10.930> a<00:00:11.080> six-foot<00:00:11.940> bamboo<00:00:12.940> rod<00:00:14.430> this

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:15.430 
it's a six-foot bamboo rod this

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.089 
it's a six-foot bamboo rod this
reservoir<00:00:15.970> I<00:00:16.059> got<00:00:16.330> from<00:00:16.599> Walmart<00:00:16.839> a<00:00:17.560> lot<00:00:18.009> of

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:18.099 
reservoir I got from Walmart a lot of

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:22.470 
reservoir I got from Walmart a lot of
people<00:00:18.220> do<00:00:18.460> the<00:00:20.609> inflation<00:00:21.609> needles<00:00:21.909> inside

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 
people do the inflation needles inside

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.029 
people do the inflation needles inside
and<00:00:24.300> submerge<00:00:25.300> the<00:00:25.569> whole<00:00:25.720> setup<00:00:26.079> but<00:00:26.499> I<00:00:26.679> did

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039 
and submerge the whole setup but I did

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:28.889 
and submerge the whole setup but I did
something<00:00:27.279> like<00:00:27.579> this<00:00:27.819> that's<00:00:28.060> a<00:00:28.210> lot<00:00:28.390> simpler

00:00:28.889 --> 00:00:28.899 
something like this that's a lot simpler

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:31.259 
something like this that's a lot simpler
it's<00:00:29.710> got<00:00:29.859> a<00:00:29.890> check<00:00:30.159> valve<00:00:30.369> here<00:00:30.789> so<00:00:31.089> that

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:31.269 
it's got a check valve here so that

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.590 
it's got a check valve here so that
bubbles<00:00:31.689> don't<00:00:31.810> come<00:00:32.050> up<00:00:32.890> into<00:00:33.430> the<00:00:34.030> tube<00:00:34.269> that

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
bubbles don't come up into the tube that

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.380 
bubbles don't come up into the tube that
tank<00:00:35.230> and<00:00:35.530> then<00:00:36.309> another<00:00:36.519> check<00:00:36.820> valve<00:00:37.030> here

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
tank and then another check valve here

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.479 
tank and then another check valve here
so<00:00:37.930> that<00:00:38.079> the<00:00:39.000> pump<00:00:40.000> doesn't<00:00:40.300> get<00:00:40.539> waterlogged

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
so that the pump doesn't get waterlogged

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.610 
so that the pump doesn't get waterlogged
so<00:00:42.489> the<00:00:42.879> air<00:00:43.059> water<00:00:43.600> mixture<00:00:44.079> happens<00:00:44.469> right

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
so the air water mixture happens right

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.299 
so the air water mixture happens right
there<00:00:44.859> and<00:00:45.339> it<00:00:45.629> bubbles<00:00:46.629> up<00:00:46.949> all<00:00:47.949> the<00:00:48.129> way<00:00:48.250> to

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
there and it bubbles up all the way to

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.240 
there and it bubbles up all the way to
the<00:00:48.519> top<00:00:48.550> where<00:00:49.000> I<00:00:49.059> have<00:00:49.269> a<00:00:49.300> muffler<00:00:49.679> and<00:00:50.679> so<00:00:51.100> it

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
the top where I have a muffler and so it

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.459 
the top where I have a muffler and so it
drips<00:00:51.910> out<00:00:52.089> of<00:00:52.239> the<00:00:52.329> muffler<00:00:52.660> and<00:00:54.660> into<00:00:55.660> plants

00:00:56.459 --> 00:00:56.469 
drips out of the muffler and into plants

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:59.880 
drips out of the muffler and into plants
keeps<00:00:57.399> them<00:00:57.519> all<00:00:58.170> constantly<00:00:59.170> wet<00:00:59.440> I<00:00:59.649> use

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
keeps them all constantly wet I use

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.200 
keeps them all constantly wet I use
socks<00:01:00.309> to<00:01:02.309> block<00:01:03.309> out<00:01:03.489> the<00:01:03.519> light<00:01:03.640> that<00:01:04.030> way<00:01:04.180> i

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
socks to block out the light that way i

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.050 
socks to block out the light that way i
can<00:01:04.470> bring<00:01:05.470> the<00:01:05.650> socks<00:01:05.890> down<00:01:06.190> and<00:01:06.580> check<00:01:06.910> on

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
can bring the socks down and check on

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.140 
can bring the socks down and check on
the<00:01:07.300> the<00:01:08.170> root<00:01:08.410> system<00:01:08.620> as<00:01:09.310> it<00:01:09.490> grows<00:01:10.230> so<00:01:11.230> yeah

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
the the root system as it grows so yeah

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.500 
the the root system as it grows so yeah
and<00:01:13.920> then<00:01:14.970> I'm<00:01:15.970> thinking<00:01:16.150> about<00:01:16.360> doing

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.510 
and then I'm thinking about doing

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.100 
and then I'm thinking about doing
something<00:01:16.960> different<00:01:17.350> right<00:01:17.470> here<00:01:17.970> maybe

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
something different right here maybe

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.140 
something different right here maybe
using<00:01:20.110> this<00:01:20.380> cap<00:01:20.680> and<00:01:21.010> putting<00:01:21.700> it<00:01:21.790> on<00:01:21.880> and

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
using this cap and putting it on and

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.540 
using this cap and putting it on and
drilling<00:01:22.540> holes<00:01:22.870> in<00:01:23.080> it<00:01:23.200> or<00:01:23.290> something<00:01:23.550> but

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
drilling holes in it or something but

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.340 
drilling holes in it or something but
for<00:01:24.940> right<00:01:25.060> now<00:01:25.090> it's<00:01:25.360> just<00:01:25.540> open<00:01:26.250> one<00:01:28.350> thing

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
for right now it's just open one thing

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.160 
for right now it's just open one thing
sweet<00:01:29.890> is<00:01:30.130> you<00:01:30.400> can<00:01:30.550> just<00:01:30.790> turn<00:01:31.030> the<00:01:31.270> water<00:01:31.810> off

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
sweet is you can just turn the water off

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.620 
sweet is you can just turn the water off
right<00:01:32.950> there<00:01:33.190> and<00:01:33.400> it<00:01:34.060> will<00:01:34.150> flush<00:01:34.420> the<00:01:34.600> system

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
right there and it will flush the system

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.400 
right there and it will flush the system
it'll<00:01:35.530> just<00:01:35.800> sound<00:01:36.430> air<00:01:36.640> through<00:01:36.880> it<00:01:36.940> so<00:01:37.840> if

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.410 
it'll just sound air through it so if

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.200 
it'll just sound air through it so if
you<00:01:38.770> can<00:01:38.920> it's<00:01:39.160> really<00:01:39.550> easy<00:01:39.700> to<00:01:39.820> take<00:01:40.060> the

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.370 
you can it's really easy to take the
system<00:01:40.570> apart<00:01:40.840> and<00:01:41.080> my<00:01:41.920> favorite<00:01:42.430> thing<00:01:43.380> one

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
system apart and my favorite thing one

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.070 
system apart and my favorite thing one
thing<00:01:44.560> that<00:01:44.590> I<00:01:44.770> was<00:01:44.920> really<00:01:45.220> worried<00:01:45.550> about<00:01:45.610> it

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
thing that I was really worried about it

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.930 
thing that I was really worried about it
actually<00:01:47.080> fits<00:01:47.380> behind<00:01:48.010> my<00:01:48.280> blinds<00:01:49.080> so<00:01:50.940> it's

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
actually fits behind my blinds so it's

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.050 
actually fits behind my blinds so it's
very<00:01:52.090> inconspicuous<00:01:52.630> and<00:01:53.350> I<00:01:54.070> don't<00:01:54.760> have<00:01:54.910> to

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
very inconspicuous and I don't have to

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.250 
very inconspicuous and I don't have to
sacrifice<00:01:55.270> any<00:01:55.780> privacy<00:01:56.230> or<00:01:56.880> light<00:01:57.880> blocking

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
sacrifice any privacy or light blocking

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.960 
sacrifice any privacy or light blocking
to<00:01:59.260> make<00:01:59.860> this<00:02:00.010> happen<00:02:00.330> so<00:02:01.380> it's<00:02:02.380> pretty<00:02:02.500> sweet
