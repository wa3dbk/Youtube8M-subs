here<00:00:02.129> on<00:00:02.220> the<00:00:02.340> show<00:00:02.659> saturation<00:00:03.659> and

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
here on the show saturation and

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.650 
here on the show saturation and
unsaturation<00:00:04.410> testing<00:00:05.069> and<00:00:05.250> oils<00:00:05.580> by<00:00:06.000> adding

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
unsaturation testing and oils by adding

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.410 
unsaturation testing and oils by adding
bromine<00:00:07.319> to<00:00:07.550> any<00:00:08.550> kind<00:00:08.730> of<00:00:08.760> oil<00:00:08.849> so<00:00:09.090> I<00:00:09.120> had<00:00:09.269> some

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
bromine to any kind of oil so I had some

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.020 
bromine to any kind of oil so I had some
vegetable<00:00:09.840> oil<00:00:09.960> here<00:00:10.670> I'm<00:00:11.670> just<00:00:11.759> going<00:00:11.940> to

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
vegetable oil here I'm just going to

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.100 
vegetable oil here I'm just going to
take<00:00:12.150> that<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:12.540> I'm<00:00:12.599> gonna<00:00:12.690> pour<00:00:12.929> a<00:00:12.960> little

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
take that and I'm gonna pour a little

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:20.380 
take that and I'm gonna pour a little
bit<00:00:13.259> in<00:00:13.349> this<00:00:13.440> test<00:00:13.710> tube<00:00:13.860> here<00:00:17.060> or<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.090> lot<00:00:19.160> so

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
bit in this test tube here or a lot so

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.849 
bit in this test tube here or a lot so
bromine<00:00:21.390> will<00:00:21.930> react<00:00:22.230> with<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.500> double<00:00:22.710> bond

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
bromine will react with the double bond

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.130 
bromine will react with the double bond
and<00:00:22.890> an<00:00:23.160> alkene<00:00:23.580> without<00:00:24.240> any<00:00:24.420> catalyst<00:00:24.960> and

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
and an alkene without any catalyst and

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.710 
and an alkene without any catalyst and
so<00:00:25.220> what<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.250> can<00:00:26.460> do<00:00:26.609> is<00:00:26.910> I<00:00:27.029> can<00:00:27.090> take<00:00:27.449> some

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
so what I can do is I can take some

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.220 
so what I can do is I can take some
bromine<00:00:28.140> water<00:00:28.349> which<00:00:28.800> has<00:00:28.949> bromine<00:00:29.369> in<00:00:29.519> it

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
bromine water which has bromine in it

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.410 
bromine water which has bromine in it
and<00:00:31.230> add<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.740> this<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.309> if<00:00:32.850> there<00:00:33.059> if

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
and add it to this and if there if

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.150 
and add it to this and if there if
there's<00:00:33.600> unsaturation<00:00:34.230> in<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:34.710> then

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
there's unsaturation in this then

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.180 
there's unsaturation in this then
automatically<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.480> bromine<00:00:36.930> should<00:00:37.320> react

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
automatically that bromine should react

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.680 
automatically that bromine should react
with<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.760> therefore<00:00:39.210> you'll<00:00:39.450> see<00:00:39.570> that

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
with it and therefore you'll see that

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.650 
with it and therefore you'll see that
colour<00:00:39.930> disappear<00:00:40.610> so<00:00:41.610> when<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:42.180> put<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.510> in

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
colour disappear so when I put that in

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.340 
colour disappear so when I put that in
there<00:00:43.910> you<00:00:44.910> can<00:00:45.059> see<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.480> orange<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.930> brownish

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
there you can see the orange is brownish

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.979 
there you can see the orange is brownish
colour<00:00:46.620> now<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.789> water<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.510> bromine<00:00:48.840> is

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
colour now the water that the bromine is

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.900 
colour now the water that the bromine is
currently<00:00:49.320> in<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:50.010> insoluble<00:00:50.430> with<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.760> oil

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
currently in is insoluble with the oil

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.740 
currently in is insoluble with the oil
but<00:00:51.120> when<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.270> mix<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.079> two<00:00:52.230> can<00:00:52.440> react<00:00:53.750> so

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
but when I mix it the two can react so

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:02.610 
but when I mix it the two can react so
they<00:00:54.989> can<00:00:55.110> get<00:00:55.260> this<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.680> go

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.780 

the<00:01:03.280> deck<00:01:03.460> focus<00:01:03.820> is<00:01:03.940> so<00:01:04.120> dense

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.790 

and<00:01:08.270> as<00:01:08.420> I<00:01:08.510> get<00:01:08.660> that<00:01:08.840> to<00:01:09.020> spend<00:01:09.320> more<00:01:09.560> and<00:01:09.710> more

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
and as I get that to spend more and more

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.830 
and as I get that to spend more and more
what<00:01:10.400> you'll<00:01:10.520> see<00:01:10.790> is<00:01:10.970> is<00:01:11.270> that<00:01:11.510> brown<00:01:11.810> color

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
what you'll see is is that brown color

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.470 
what you'll see is is that brown color
is<00:01:12.380> starting<00:01:12.860> to<00:01:12.950> disappear<00:01:13.480> that's

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:14.480 
is starting to disappear that's

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.420 
is starting to disappear that's
disappearing<00:01:15.110> because<00:01:15.560> the<00:01:15.800> bromine<00:01:16.250> is

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
disappearing because the bromine is

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.790 
disappearing because the bromine is
adding<00:01:16.850> to<00:01:16.970> the<00:01:17.090> various<00:01:17.420> double<00:01:17.720> bonds<00:01:18.110> that

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
adding to the various double bonds that

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.710 
adding to the various double bonds that
are<00:01:18.950> in<00:01:19.130> that<00:01:19.340> vegetable<00:01:19.550> oil<00:01:22.330> and<00:01:23.330> so<00:01:23.480> what<00:01:23.630> we

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
are in that vegetable oil and so what we

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.940 
are in that vegetable oil and so what we
conclude<00:01:24.170> from<00:01:24.200> that<00:01:24.380> is<00:01:24.620> that<00:01:24.650> that

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
conclude from that is that that

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.370 
conclude from that is that that
vegetable<00:01:25.520> oil<00:01:25.640> had<00:01:25.850> unsaturation<00:01:26.660> it<00:01:29.380> well

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
vegetable oil had unsaturation it well

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.050 
vegetable oil had unsaturation it well
let's<00:01:30.560> try<00:01:30.710> that<00:01:30.860> again<00:01:30.920> with<00:01:31.430> this<00:01:31.790> time<00:01:31.970> with

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
let's try that again with this time with

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.240 
let's try that again with this time with
a<00:01:32.150> different<00:01:32.180> oil<00:01:32.630> and<00:01:32.750> hopefully<00:01:32.990> I<00:01:33.020> don't

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
a different oil and hopefully I don't

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:48.010 
a different oil and hopefully I don't
overfill<00:01:34.250> here<00:01:34.460> so<00:01:34.700> here's<00:01:34.880> some<00:01:35.000> olive<00:01:35.330> oil

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.980 

they're<00:01:49.910> so<00:01:50.910> same<00:01:51.150> thing<00:01:51.330> again<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:51.840> take

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
they're so same thing again and I take

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.360 
they're so same thing again and I take
some<00:01:52.140> bromine<00:01:52.470> water<00:01:54.560> and<00:01:55.560> then<00:01:55.860> add<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.250> to

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
some bromine water and then add it to

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.790 
some bromine water and then add it to
the<00:01:56.430> olive<00:01:56.700> oil<00:02:00.080> okay<00:02:01.080> and<00:02:01.200> again<00:02:01.410> you<00:02:01.500> can<00:02:01.620> see

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
the olive oil okay and again you can see

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.460 
the olive oil okay and again you can see
the<00:02:01.920> bromine<00:02:02.310> at<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.520> very<00:02:02.670> bottom<00:02:03.350> going<00:02:04.350> on

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
the bromine at the very bottom going on

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.830 
the bromine at the very bottom going on
and<00:02:04.620> the<00:02:04.680> same<00:02:04.860> thing<00:02:05.010> I'm<00:02:05.100> gonna<00:02:05.250> shake<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.840> as

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
and the same thing I'm gonna shake it as

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.450 
and the same thing I'm gonna shake it as
I<00:02:06.990> shake<00:02:07.230> it<00:02:07.260> that<00:02:07.530> brown<00:02:07.740> color<00:02:08.010> is<00:02:08.160> going<00:02:08.369> to

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
I shake it that brown color is going to

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.300 
I shake it that brown color is going to
fade<00:02:09.140> so<00:02:10.140> we<00:02:10.200> can<00:02:10.350> say<00:02:10.470> faded<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.950> little<00:02:10.980> bit

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
fade so we can say faded a little bit

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.890 
fade so we can say faded a little bit
there<00:02:11.520> we<00:02:11.550> still<00:02:11.850> got<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.030> little<00:02:12.240> bit<00:02:12.570> left<00:02:12.720> at

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
there we still got a little bit left at

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.720 
there we still got a little bit left at
the<00:02:12.990> bottom<00:02:13.640> continue<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.760> shake<00:02:14.970> it<00:02:15.150> though

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
the bottom continue to shake it though

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.400 
the bottom continue to shake it though
and<00:02:17.730> now<00:02:17.910> there<00:02:18.420> is<00:02:18.450> no<00:02:18.720> more<00:02:18.870> brown<00:02:19.050> color

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.110 

okay<00:02:22.410> so<00:02:22.920> that<00:02:23.100> shows<00:02:23.340> that<00:02:23.550> our<00:02:23.610> olive<00:02:23.940> oil

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
okay so that shows that our olive oil

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.840 
okay so that shows that our olive oil
had<00:02:24.480> an<00:02:25.440> unsaturation<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.250> it<00:02:26.340> now<00:02:26.490> another

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
had an unsaturation to it now another

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.460 
had an unsaturation to it now another
thing<00:02:27.000> you'll<00:02:27.150> notice<00:02:27.420> as<00:02:27.810> I'm<00:02:27.960> doing<00:02:28.170> this

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
thing you'll notice as I'm doing this

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.140 
thing you'll notice as I'm doing this
that<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:28.980> consistency<00:02:29.670> of<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.820> oil<00:02:29.970> is

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
that the consistency of the oil is

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.820 
that the consistency of the oil is
changing<00:02:30.570> so<00:02:31.140> I'm<00:02:31.230> going<00:02:31.350> to<00:02:31.410> set<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:31.590> down

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
changing so I'm going to set that down

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:32.990 
changing so I'm going to set that down
there<00:02:32.040> for<00:02:32.190> a<00:02:32.250> second<00:02:32.550> I'm<00:02:32.640> going<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:32.790> pour

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
there for a second I'm going to pour

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.940 
there for a second I'm going to pour
some<00:02:33.030> olive<00:02:33.600> oil<00:02:33.720> back<00:02:34.200> into<00:02:34.230> a<00:02:34.470> second

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
some olive oil back into a second

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.490 
some olive oil back into a second
container<00:02:35.520> to<00:02:36.390> compare<00:02:36.810> what<00:02:37.050> I<00:02:37.080> have<00:02:37.320> now

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
container to compare what I have now

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.350 
container to compare what I have now
with<00:02:37.650> what<00:02:37.800> I<00:02:37.830> had<00:02:37.980> then<00:02:38.130> as<00:02:38.370> I'm<00:02:38.850> changing<00:02:39.030> the

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
with what I had then as I'm changing the

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.720 
with what I had then as I'm changing the
saturation<00:02:39.930> I'm<00:02:40.230> changing<00:02:40.740> the<00:02:41.250> interactions

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
saturation I'm changing the interactions

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.180 
saturation I'm changing the interactions
between<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:42.060> molecules<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:42.780> so<00:02:43.140> this<00:02:44.010> is

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
between the molecules and so this is

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.550 
between the molecules and so this is
starting<00:02:44.520> to<00:02:44.610> kind<00:02:44.790> of<00:02:44.910> grease<00:02:45.750> up<00:02:45.990> quite<00:02:46.530> a

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
starting to kind of grease up quite a

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.460 
starting to kind of grease up quite a
bit<00:02:46.830> into<00:02:47.040> a<00:02:47.190> solid<00:02:47.640> kind<00:02:47.760> of<00:02:47.880> clumpy<00:02:48.180> form

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
bit into a solid kind of clumpy form

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.920 
bit into a solid kind of clumpy form
because<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.890> saturated<00:02:50.790> forms<00:02:51.180> have<00:02:51.570> better

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
because the saturated forms have better

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.600 
because the saturated forms have better
in<00:02:52.110> a<00:02:52.170> molecular<00:02:52.380> force<00:02:52.800> with<00:02:53.070> each<00:02:53.190> other<00:02:53.370> the

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
in a molecular force with each other the

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.790 
in a molecular force with each other the
kinks<00:02:54.000> in<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.780> double<00:02:55.050> bond<00:02:55.200> in<00:02:55.380> that<00:02:55.530> kind<00:02:55.709> of

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
kinks in the double bond in that kind of

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.310 
kinks in the double bond in that kind of
planar<00:02:56.100> section<00:02:56.790> makes<00:02:57.780> it<00:02:57.900> difficult<00:02:58.050> for

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
planar section makes it difficult for

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.780 
planar section makes it difficult for
multiple<00:02:58.770> oils<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.100> interact<00:02:59.370> this<00:02:59.550> is<00:02:59.670> why

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
multiple oils to interact this is why

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.810 
multiple oils to interact this is why
most<00:03:00.150> oils<00:03:00.480> are<00:03:00.600> liquids<00:03:00.989> and<00:03:01.250> most<00:03:02.250> greases

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
most oils are liquids and most greases

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.090 
most oils are liquids and most greases
are<00:03:03.000> solid<00:03:03.720> at<00:03:03.930> a<00:03:04.260> regular<00:03:04.620> temperature<00:03:04.860> and

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
are solid at a regular temperature and

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.650 
are solid at a regular temperature and
pressure<00:03:05.280> so<00:03:05.550> you<00:03:05.610> can<00:03:05.730> see<00:03:05.940> that<00:03:06.120> difference

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
pressure so you can see that difference

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.390 
pressure so you can see that difference
by<00:03:06.870> adding<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.230> bromine<00:03:07.650> and<00:03:07.800> removing<00:03:08.280> that

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
by adding the bromine and removing that

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.440 
by adding the bromine and removing that
unsaturation<00:03:09.030> that<00:03:09.930> we're<00:03:10.050> getting<00:03:10.350> in<00:03:10.440> there

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:28.570 

all<00:03:15.450> right<00:03:15.630> and<00:03:16.700> let's<00:03:17.700> try<00:03:18.030> peanut<00:03:18.510> oil

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.610 

so<00:03:29.150> here's<00:03:29.360> my<00:03:29.480> peanut<00:03:29.840> oil<00:03:30.050> and<00:03:30.140> I<00:03:30.230> sat<00:03:30.410> in

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
so here's my peanut oil and I sat in

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.470 
so here's my peanut oil and I sat in
here<00:03:30.830> for<00:03:31.100> a<00:03:31.160> second<00:03:31.580> so<00:03:31.670> I<00:03:31.820> can<00:03:31.850> grab<00:03:32.090> some<00:03:32.300> bro

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
here for a second so I can grab some bro

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:42.449 
here for a second so I can grab some bro
me

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.119 

okay<00:03:43.150> so<00:03:44.140> there's<00:03:44.439> our<00:03:44.590> bromine<00:03:44.920> at<00:03:45.040> the

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:45.129 
okay so there's our bromine at the

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:46.410 
okay so there's our bromine at the
bottom<00:03:45.459> here's<00:03:45.640> our<00:03:45.760> peanut<00:03:46.030> oil<00:03:46.209> we're<00:03:46.329> gonna

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
bottom here's our peanut oil we're gonna

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.740 
bottom here's our peanut oil we're gonna
shake<00:03:46.719> and<00:03:47.670> that<00:03:48.670> was<00:03:48.909> it<00:03:49.030> very<00:03:49.180> clear<00:03:49.599> to

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
shake and that was it very clear to

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.690 
shake and that was it very clear to
start<00:03:51.900> so<00:03:52.900> it<00:03:53.049> looks<00:03:53.260> like<00:03:53.469> it's<00:03:53.680> clearing<00:03:54.519> up

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
start so it looks like it's clearing up

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.420 
start so it looks like it's clearing up
a<00:03:54.819> little<00:03:55.060> bit<00:03:55.980> let's<00:03:56.980> get<00:03:57.189> going<00:03:59.310> so<00:04:00.310> our

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
a little bit let's get going so our

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.360 
a little bit let's get going so our
brown<00:04:00.700> color<00:04:01.030> is<00:04:01.239> gone<00:04:01.560> but<00:04:02.560> you<00:04:02.980> can<00:04:03.129> see

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
brown color is gone but you can see

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.220 
brown color is gone but you can see
again<00:04:03.639> that<00:04:03.700> the<00:04:03.939> the<00:04:04.480> consistency<00:04:05.139> has

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
again that the the consistency has

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.050 
again that the the consistency has
changed<00:04:05.829> by<00:04:06.099> adding<00:04:06.280> that<00:04:06.489> much<00:04:06.609> bromine<00:04:07.030> to

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
changed by adding that much bromine to

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.149 
changed by adding that much bromine to
it<00:04:07.299> now<00:04:07.840> at<00:04:07.959> some<00:04:08.200> point<00:04:08.439> if<00:04:08.530> I<00:04:08.620> continue<00:04:09.129> to

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:09.159 
it now at some point if I continue to

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:11.190 
it now at some point if I continue to
add<00:04:09.430> bromine<00:04:09.969> and<00:04:10.120> continue<00:04:10.480> to<00:04:10.569> add<00:04:10.659> bromine

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
add bromine and continue to add bromine

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.800 
add bromine and continue to add bromine
at<00:04:11.920> some<00:04:12.250> point<00:04:12.489> all<00:04:12.700> of<00:04:12.730> the<00:04:13.000> unsaturation<00:04:13.629> x'

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
at some point all of the unsaturation x'

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.839 
at some point all of the unsaturation x'
will<00:04:14.019> get<00:04:14.170> it<00:04:14.260> used<00:04:14.500> up<00:04:14.709> and<00:04:15.010> I'll<00:04:15.489> be<00:04:15.609> left

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849 
will get it used up and I'll be left

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:18.719 
will get it used up and I'll be left
with<00:04:15.970> the<00:04:16.180> brown<00:04:16.359> color<00:04:16.630> remaining<00:04:17.729> however

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
with the brown color remaining however

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:20.729 
with the brown color remaining however
at<00:04:19.090> the<00:04:19.180> same<00:04:19.419> time<00:04:19.720> I'm<00:04:20.019> also<00:04:20.139> getting<00:04:20.470> some

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
at the same time I'm also getting some

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.800 
at the same time I'm also getting some
solidification<00:04:21.220> going<00:04:21.849> on<00:04:21.970> here<00:04:22.150> that's

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
solidification going on here that's

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.150 
solidification going on here that's
making<00:04:23.199> that<00:04:23.349> a<00:04:23.380> little<00:04:23.620> difficult<00:04:24.070> to

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
making that a little difficult to

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:31.030 
making that a little difficult to
achieve

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.280 

maybe<00:04:31.970> there<00:04:32.270> we're<00:04:32.630> getting<00:04:32.900> that<00:04:33.020> access

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
maybe there we're getting that access

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.130 
maybe there we're getting that access
bromine<00:04:34.010> there<00:04:34.390> that<00:04:35.390> does<00:04:35.570> not<00:04:35.870> look<00:04:36.110> like

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
bromine there that does not look like

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:41.680 
bromine there that does not look like
it's<00:04:36.470> going<00:04:36.770> away<00:04:39.940> and<00:04:40.940> to<00:04:41.060> check<00:04:41.330> that<00:04:41.540> we're

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
it's going away and to check that we're

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.580 
it's going away and to check that we're
gonna<00:04:41.780> had<00:04:41.930> a<00:04:41.960> little<00:04:42.260> more<00:04:42.410> bromine<00:04:42.860> again

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
gonna had a little more bromine again

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:50.520 
gonna had a little more bromine again
and<00:04:45.590> see<00:04:45.740> if<00:04:45.770> we've<00:04:47.140> reached<00:04:48.140> a<00:04:48.320> point<00:04:48.530> where

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
and see if we've reached a point where

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:56.980 
and see if we've reached a point where
we<00:04:51.530> have<00:04:51.920> an<00:04:52.040> excess<00:04:52.460> of<00:04:52.640> bromine<00:04:55.810> it<00:04:56.810> looks

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
we have an excess of bromine it looks

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.630 
we have an excess of bromine it looks
like<00:04:57.200> I<00:04:57.320> can<00:04:57.500> see<00:04:57.770> that<00:04:57.980> color<00:04:58.250> kind<00:04:58.490> of

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
like I can see that color kind of

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.520 
like I can see that color kind of
persisting<00:04:59.330> and<00:04:59.540> then<00:04:59.630> settling<00:05:00.110> down<00:05:00.230> to<00:05:00.410> the

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
persisting and then settling down to the

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.410 
persisting and then settling down to the
bottom<00:05:00.890> here<00:05:00.920> but<00:05:01.580> maybe<00:05:01.730> not<00:05:01.970> maybe<00:05:02.270> it's

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:02.420 
bottom here but maybe not maybe it's

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:08.080 
bottom here but maybe not maybe it's
just<00:05:02.570> taking<00:05:02.810> a<00:05:02.840> little<00:05:02.960> bit<00:05:03.140> of<00:05:03.200> time<00:05:06.940> and<00:05:07.940> now

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
just taking a little bit of time and now

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.370 
just taking a little bit of time and now
definitely<00:05:08.570> we<00:05:08.630> kind<00:05:08.840> of<00:05:08.900> have<00:05:08.990> that<00:05:09.020> white

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
definitely we kind of have that white

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.180 
definitely we kind of have that white
milky<00:05:10.180> fat<00:05:11.180> kind<00:05:11.870> of<00:05:11.960> substance<00:05:12.440> that<00:05:12.530> we<00:05:13.040> used

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
milky fat kind of substance that we used

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:20.499 
milky fat kind of substance that we used
to<00:05:13.310> sing<00:05:13.550> for<00:05:13.850> greece's

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:20.509 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:22.149 

that's<00:05:20.960> one<00:05:21.169> could<00:05:21.319> take<00:05:21.469> eight<00:05:21.650> years<00:05:21.680> to

00:05:22.149 --> 00:05:22.159 
that's one could take eight years to

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:46.950 
that's one could take eight years to
finish<00:05:22.389> let's<00:05:23.389> dress

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.930 

so<00:05:47.560> if<00:05:47.650> you<00:05:47.740> can<00:05:47.860> see<00:05:48.039> this<00:05:48.250> I'm<00:05:48.490> kind<00:05:48.699> of<00:05:48.789> got<00:05:48.910> a

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
so if you can see this I'm kind of got a

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.090 
so if you can see this I'm kind of got a
layer<00:05:49.270> of<00:05:49.300> solid<00:05:49.780> here<00:05:50.169> that's<00:05:50.380> blocking<00:05:50.770> my

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.100 
layer of solid here that's blocking my

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.480 
layer of solid here that's blocking my
bromine<00:05:51.580> from<00:05:51.820> mixing<00:05:52.270> well<00:05:53.310> let's<00:05:54.310> actually

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 
bromine from mixing well let's actually

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:20.410 
bromine from mixing well let's actually
get<00:05:54.820> this<00:05:55.030> out<00:05:55.210> here<00:05:55.240> in<00:05:55.509> time<00:05:55.720> it's<00:05:56.199> work

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:20.420 

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.520 

so<00:06:21.420> there<00:06:21.570> we<00:06:21.660> go<00:06:21.690> looks<00:06:22.020> like<00:06:22.080> a<00:06:22.170> lot<00:06:22.410> of

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.530 
so there we go looks like a lot of

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.160 
so there we go looks like a lot of
unsaturation<00:06:23.130> in<00:06:23.430> this<00:06:23.610> olive<00:06:23.940> oil<00:06:24.090> just<00:06:25.050> go

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:25.170 
unsaturation in this olive oil just go

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:40.429 
unsaturation in this olive oil just go
ahead<00:06:25.230> and<00:06:25.410> pour<00:06:25.650> some<00:06:25.920> bromine<00:06:26.400> in<00:06:26.580> there

00:06:40.429 --> 00:06:40.439 

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:43.529 

so<00:06:41.439> bromine<00:06:42.009> is<00:06:42.219> is<00:06:42.429> able<00:06:42.849> to<00:06:42.999> react<00:06:43.330> with<00:06:43.479> the

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:43.539 
so bromine is is able to react with the

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:46.949 
so bromine is is able to react with the
electrons<00:06:44.110> in<00:06:44.439> the<00:06:45.189> in<00:06:45.729> the<00:06:46.239> pi<00:06:46.389> bond<00:06:46.689> of<00:06:46.869> the

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:46.959 
electrons in the in the pi bond of the

00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:49.589 
electrons in the in the pi bond of the
alkyne<00:06:47.349> really<00:06:48.069> well<00:06:48.279> because<00:06:48.579> bromine<00:06:49.360> is

00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:49.599 
alkyne really well because bromine is

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:50.959 
alkyne really well because bromine is
something<00:06:49.959> that's<00:06:50.110> very<00:06:50.319> electrophilic

00:06:50.959 --> 00:06:50.969 
something that's very electrophilic

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:52.949 
something that's very electrophilic
other<00:06:51.969> things<00:06:52.360> that<00:06:52.599> are<00:06:52.719> not<00:06:52.839> as

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:52.959 
other things that are not as

00:06:52.959 --> 00:06:55.499 
other things that are not as
electrophilic<00:06:53.559> are<00:06:54.099> not<00:06:54.279> able<00:06:54.459> to<00:06:54.579> do<00:06:54.819> so<00:06:55.089> so

00:06:55.499 --> 00:06:55.509 
electrophilic are not able to do so so

00:06:55.509 --> 00:06:58.589 
electrophilic are not able to do so so
so<00:06:55.989> if<00:06:56.110> you<00:06:56.199> have<00:06:56.289> hydrogen<00:06:56.649> or<00:06:57.599> something

00:06:58.589 --> 00:06:58.599 
so if you have hydrogen or something

00:06:58.599 --> 00:06:59.819 
so if you have hydrogen or something
else<00:06:58.869> you<00:06:58.989> probably<00:06:59.019> will<00:06:59.409> need<00:06:59.499> an<00:06:59.619> acid

00:06:59.819 --> 00:06:59.829 
else you probably will need an acid

00:06:59.829 --> 00:07:01.739 
else you probably will need an acid
catalyst<00:07:00.459> these<00:07:00.669> I'm<00:07:00.819> just<00:07:01.029> literally<00:07:01.299> mixing

00:07:01.739 --> 00:07:01.749 
catalyst these I'm just literally mixing

00:07:01.749 --> 00:07:04.129 
catalyst these I'm just literally mixing
the<00:07:01.839> oils<00:07:02.169> with<00:07:02.349> some<00:07:02.499> bromine<00:07:02.919> and<00:07:03.639> that's<00:07:03.789> it

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:04.139 
the oils with some bromine and that's it

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:06.379 
the oils with some bromine and that's it
there's<00:07:05.139> water<00:07:05.349> there<00:07:05.589> as<00:07:05.679> well

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:06.389 
there's water there as well

00:07:06.389 --> 00:07:08.489 
there's water there as well
so<00:07:07.389> we<00:07:07.449> can<00:07:07.569> see<00:07:07.689> quite<00:07:08.079> a<00:07:08.110> bit<00:07:08.379> of

00:07:08.489 --> 00:07:08.499 
so we can see quite a bit of

00:07:08.499 --> 00:07:10.319 
so we can see quite a bit of
unsaturation<00:07:09.039> even<00:07:09.429> after<00:07:09.639> all<00:07:09.789> that<00:07:09.819> bromine

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:10.329 
unsaturation even after all that bromine

00:07:10.329 --> 00:07:13.439 
unsaturation even after all that bromine
I'm<00:07:10.449> still<00:07:10.689> getting<00:07:10.959> to<00:07:11.079> that<00:07:11.169> point
