through<00:00:00.380> surgery<00:00:01.380> paramilitaries<00:00:02.220> for<00:00:02.429> the

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
through surgery paramilitaries for the

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.260 
through surgery paramilitaries for the
same<00:00:02.669> price<00:00:02.959> less<00:00:04.279> so<00:00:05.279> kind<00:00:05.730> of<00:00:05.790> a<00:00:05.910> right<00:00:06.240> I

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
same price less so kind of a right I

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.980 
same price less so kind of a right I
mean<00:00:06.509> to<00:00:06.649> break<00:00:07.649> a<00:00:07.710> knife<00:00:08.010> and<00:00:08.660> break<00:00:09.660> this<00:00:09.809> one

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
mean to break a knife and break this one

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.270 
mean to break a knife and break this one
you're<00:00:10.050> you're<00:00:10.620> out<00:00:10.800> a<00:00:10.830> lot<00:00:11.040> of<00:00:11.130> dough<00:00:11.250> and

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
you're you're out a lot of dough and

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.620 
you're you're out a lot of dough and
it's<00:00:11.639> got<00:00:11.820> in<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:11.969> field<00:00:12.179> you're<00:00:12.420> kind<00:00:12.570> of

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
it's got in the field you're kind of

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.950 
it's got in the field you're kind of
stuck<00:00:12.950> but<00:00:13.950> you<00:00:14.700> know<00:00:14.790> we're<00:00:15.480> just<00:00:15.509> talking

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
stuck but you know we're just talking

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.570 
stuck but you know we're just talking
here<00:00:15.990> in<00:00:16.289> theory<00:00:16.590> if<00:00:16.710> you<00:00:16.859> had<00:00:17.039> two

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
here in theory if you had two

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.099 
here in theory if you had two
paramilitaries<00:00:18.330> you<00:00:18.449> break<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.720> first<00:00:18.869> one

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
paramilitaries you break the first one

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.380 
paramilitaries you break the first one
you<00:00:19.230> go<00:00:19.350> on<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:20.580> next<00:00:20.789> one<00:00:20.880> it's<00:00:21.180> still

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
you go on to the next one it's still

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.189 
you go on to the next one it's still
cheaper<00:00:21.720> so<00:00:23.720> interesting<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.750> other<00:00:24.960> thing<00:00:25.140> I

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
cheaper so interesting the other thing I

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.300 
cheaper so interesting the other thing I
didn't<00:00:25.439> quite<00:00:25.590> mention<00:00:25.890> is<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.070> there's

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
didn't quite mention is that there's

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.169 
didn't quite mention is that there's
some<00:00:26.490> kind<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:28.070> purposeful<00:00:29.070> cats<00:00:29.880> when<00:00:30.090> you

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
some kind of purposeful cats when you

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.540 
some kind of purposeful cats when you
open<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.449> knife<00:00:31.579> kind<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.669> stops<00:00:32.940> right<00:00:33.059> here

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
open the knife kind of stops right here

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.190 
open the knife kind of stops right here
you<00:00:35.550> have<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.790> kind<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.090> pop<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.899> out<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.020> little

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
you have to kind of pop it out a little

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.420 
you have to kind of pop it out a little
further<00:00:38.629> so<00:00:39.710> let's<00:00:40.710> watch<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:41.070> open<00:00:41.309> here

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
further so let's watch it open here

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:50.330 
further so let's watch it open here
again<00:00:44.989> look<00:00:45.989> this<00:00:46.140> just<00:00:46.410> right<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:49.340> little

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
again look this just right a little

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.660 
again look this just right a little
bright<00:00:50.550> maybe

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.599 

okay<00:00:55.179> that's<00:00:55.359> better<00:00:55.559> it's<00:00:56.559> like<00:00:56.739> a<00:00:56.769> swing

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:57.609 
okay that's better it's like a swing

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:03.029 
okay that's better it's like a swing
open<00:01:00.390> okay<00:01:01.390> see<00:01:01.719> the<00:01:01.809> frame<00:01:02.019> on<00:01:02.170> the<00:01:02.379> side<00:01:02.589> come

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
open okay see the frame on the side come

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:11.140 
open okay see the frame on the side come
into<00:01:03.219> place<00:01:03.780> I'll<00:01:04.780> do<00:01:04.930> it<00:01:05.019> again<00:01:05.049> without<00:01:05.409> side

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.520 

ok<00:01:11.840> open<00:01:12.440> it<00:01:12.530> up

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.149 

ops<00:01:16.530> in<00:01:16.710> place<00:01:17.450> now<00:01:18.680> what<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.710> didn't<00:01:20.040> talk

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
ops in place now what I didn't talk

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.880 
ops in place now what I didn't talk
about<00:01:20.310> on<00:01:20.760> this<00:01:20.970> was<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.869> he<00:01:22.140> does<00:01:22.380> have<00:01:22.680> this

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
about on this was that he does have this

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.790 
about on this was that he does have this
rectangular<00:01:23.490> almost<00:01:24.060> spyderco<00:01:24.720> hole<00:01:25.710> opening

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
rectangular almost spyderco hole opening

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.340 
rectangular almost spyderco hole opening
obviously<00:01:28.800> it<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:29.009> on<00:01:29.130> both<00:01:29.280> side<00:01:29.460> right<00:01:29.729> hole

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
obviously it is on both side right hole

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.960 
obviously it is on both side right hole
it<00:01:31.350> also<00:01:31.500> has<00:01:31.830> these<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.430> has<00:01:32.580> these<00:01:32.700> blade

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
it also has these it has these blade

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.290 
it also has these it has these blade
stops<00:01:33.330> that<00:01:33.509> look<00:01:33.690> like<00:01:33.810> thumb<00:01:34.020> studs

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
stops that look like thumb studs

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.910 
stops that look like thumb studs
depending<00:01:36.300> on<00:01:36.300> where<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.560> read<00:01:37.740> on<00:01:37.890> the

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
depending on where you read on the

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.040 
depending on where you read on the
Internet<00:01:38.180> people<00:01:39.180> think<00:01:39.390> those<00:01:39.659> are<00:01:39.690> thumb

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
Internet people think those are thumb

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.249 
Internet people think those are thumb
studs<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:41.030> would<00:01:42.030> disagree<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.690> don't<00:01:42.960> think

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
studs I would disagree I don't think

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.170 
studs I would disagree I don't think
it's<00:01:43.530> possible<00:01:43.830> to<00:01:44.190> open<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.700> knife<00:01:44.880> with

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
it's possible to open the knife with

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.370 
it's possible to open the knife with
these<00:01:45.390> things<00:01:46.009> pretty<00:01:47.009> difficult<00:01:48.259> again<00:01:49.259> my

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
these things pretty difficult again my

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.350 
these things pretty difficult again my
knock<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:49.710> brand<00:01:50.399> new<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:50.940> doesn't<00:01:51.240> be

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
knock this brand new so it doesn't be

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:58.639 
knock this brand new so it doesn't be
broken<00:01:51.840> but<00:01:52.080> I<00:01:52.259> only<00:01:52.590> local<00:01:54.590> and<00:01:57.500> so<00:01:58.500> that's

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
broken but I only local and so that's

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.560 
broken but I only local and so that's
that<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:59.160> wouldn't<00:01:59.759> consider<00:01:59.940> these<00:02:00.330> thumb

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
that I wouldn't consider these thumb

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.969 
that I wouldn't consider these thumb
studs<00:02:00.960> if<00:02:01.200> you're<00:02:02.030> looking<00:02:03.030> at<00:02:03.119> one<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.330> these

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
studs if you're looking at one of these

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.199 
studs if you're looking at one of these
I<00:02:05.149> would<00:02:06.149> also<00:02:06.179> say<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:07.580> the<00:02:08.580> rectangular

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
I would also say that the rectangular

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.540 
I would also say that the rectangular
opening<00:02:10.039> oval<00:02:11.420> opening<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.660> good<00:02:13.380> but<00:02:14.370> it's

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
opening oval opening is good but it's

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.620 
opening oval opening is good but it's
not<00:02:14.610> quite<00:02:14.970> as<00:02:15.209> good<00:02:15.390> as<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:16.310> spyderco

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
not quite as good as the spyderco

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.979 
not quite as good as the spyderco
opening<00:02:18.739> mechanism<00:02:19.850> the<00:02:20.850> circle<00:02:21.299> is<00:02:21.510> just

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
opening mechanism the circle is just

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.870 
opening mechanism the circle is just
easier<00:02:22.350> to<00:02:22.380> catch<00:02:22.650> on<00:02:22.920> multiple<00:02:23.280> sides<00:02:23.459> here

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
easier to catch on multiple sides here

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.460 
easier to catch on multiple sides here
it's<00:02:24.120> not<00:02:24.329> quite<00:02:24.510> big<00:02:24.690> enough<00:02:24.720> and<00:02:27.260> you<00:02:28.260> can

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
it's not quite big enough and you can

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.300 
it's not quite big enough and you can
kind<00:02:28.590> of<00:02:28.680> lose<00:02:28.860> some<00:02:29.070> traction<00:02:29.310> a<00:02:29.489> little<00:02:29.700> bit

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
kind of lose some traction a little bit

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.710 
kind of lose some traction a little bit
but<00:02:32.310> my<00:02:33.090> alternative<00:02:33.660> method<00:02:34.019> is<00:02:34.670> to<00:02:35.670> hold<00:02:36.570> it

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
but my alternative method is to hold it

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.360 
but my alternative method is to hold it
as<00:02:36.840> normal<00:02:36.989> but<00:02:37.380> take<00:02:37.560> your<00:02:37.680> index<00:02:37.829> finger

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
as normal but take your index finger

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.880 
as normal but take your index finger
slide<00:02:38.850> it<00:02:38.970> through<00:02:39.150> this<00:02:39.299> way<00:02:39.680> and<00:02:40.680> flick<00:02:40.860> it

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
slide it through this way and flick it

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.590 
slide it through this way and flick it
out<00:02:41.040> like<00:02:41.220> that<00:02:41.370> that<00:02:41.910> seems<00:02:42.120> to<00:02:42.269> work<00:02:42.420> better

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
out like that that seems to work better

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.740 
out like that that seems to work better
has<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:42.959> little<00:02:43.110> bit<00:02:43.260> better<00:02:43.350> traction<00:02:44.390> so<00:02:45.390> I

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
has a little bit better traction so I

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.289 
has a little bit better traction so I
don't<00:02:46.049> think<00:02:46.140> I<00:02:46.260> can<00:02:46.410> do<00:02:46.560> it<00:02:46.590> but<00:02:47.459> there<00:02:48.120> we<00:02:48.180> go

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
don't think I can do it but there we go

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.390 
don't think I can do it but there we go
locked<00:02:49.049> in<00:02:49.200> place<00:02:49.320> we're<00:02:49.739> using<00:02:49.920> my<00:02:50.130> index

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
locked in place we're using my index

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.590 
locked in place we're using my index
finger<00:02:50.489> I<00:02:50.959> kind<00:02:51.959> of<00:02:51.989> like<00:02:52.140> that<00:02:52.170> mechanism<00:02:53.600> the

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
finger I kind of like that mechanism the

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.680 
finger I kind of like that mechanism the
since<00:02:55.320> the<00:02:55.440> knife<00:02:55.590> is<00:02:55.769> so<00:02:55.980> new<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.690> closing

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
since the knife is so new the closing

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.650 
since the knife is so new the closing
lock<00:02:57.900> is<00:02:58.079> real<00:02:58.230> tough<00:02:58.470> still<00:02:59.130> but<00:02:59.160> I<00:03:00.150> kind<00:03:00.540> of

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
lock is real tough still but I kind of

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.460 
lock is real tough still but I kind of
expected<00:03:01.230> that<00:03:01.290> before<00:03:01.799> i<00:03:01.829> bought<00:03:02.070> it

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
expected that before i bought it

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.000 
expected that before i bought it
I'm<00:03:03.920> sure<00:03:04.160> that<00:03:04.340> will<00:03:04.460> break<00:03:04.610> in<00:03:04.820> shortly<00:03:06.010> I'm

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
I'm sure that will break in shortly I'm

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.720 
I'm sure that will break in shortly I'm
sure<00:03:07.220> but<00:03:07.430> my<00:03:07.610> thumb's<00:03:08.090> will<00:03:08.390> break<00:03:08.660> quicker

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
sure but my thumb's will break quicker

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.910 
sure but my thumb's will break quicker
so<00:03:10.730> that's<00:03:11.630> the<00:03:11.780> knife<00:03:12.020> you<00:03:12.710> have<00:03:12.800> any
