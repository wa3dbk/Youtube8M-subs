evenly<00:03:04.410> if<00:03:04.770> not<00:03:05.040> we<00:03:05.760> can<00:03:05.910> totally<00:03:06.120> adjust<00:03:06.960> that

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
evenly if not we can totally adjust that

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.890 
evenly if not we can totally adjust that
it's<00:03:07.470> not<00:03:07.680> a<00:03:07.710> big<00:03:08.040> problem<00:03:08.280> at<00:03:08.670> all<00:03:08.700> now<00:03:09.690> what

I decided to do since I have four
different<00:03:40.709> wefts

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
different wefts

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.960 
different wefts
for<00:03:41.850> every<00:03:42.270> size<00:03:42.630> I<00:03:43.050> decided<00:03:43.650> to<00:03:43.890> keep<00:03:44.130> two

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
for every size I decided to keep two

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.690 
for every size I decided to keep two
wefts<00:03:45.390> with<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:46.170> clips<00:03:46.500> with<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.040> strongest

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
wefts with the clips with the strongest

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.910 
wefts with the clips with the strongest
sown<00:03:47.970> clips<00:03:48.270> that<00:03:48.450> are<00:03:48.510> still<00:03:48.750> okay<00:03:49.080> so<00:03:49.650> these

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
sown clips that are still okay so these

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.949 
sown clips that are still okay so these
ones<00:03:50.250> are<00:03:50.550> the<00:03:51.120> ones<00:03:51.209> that<00:03:51.450> we<00:03:51.540> decided<00:03:51.870> to

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
ones are the ones that we decided to

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.930 
ones are the ones that we decided to
keep<00:03:52.170> this<00:03:52.530> one<00:03:52.740> has<00:03:52.980> two<00:03:53.310> clips<00:03:53.610> that<00:03:53.790> were

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
keep this one has two clips that were

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.300 
keep this one has two clips that were
sewn<00:03:54.270> on<00:03:54.450> really<00:03:55.110> really<00:03:55.380> well<00:03:55.620> so<00:03:55.650> they<00:03:56.190> won't

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
sewn on really really well so they won't

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.340 
sewn on really really well so they won't
need<00:03:56.490> to<00:03:56.640> be<00:03:56.760> resewn<00:03:57.209> this<00:03:57.780> one<00:03:57.959> was<00:03:58.080> hanging

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
need to be resewn this one was hanging

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.350 
need to be resewn this one was hanging
off<00:03:58.440> so<00:03:58.680> I<00:03:58.709> removed<00:03:59.130> and<00:03:59.430> then<00:03:59.910> there<00:04:00.150> was<00:04:00.240> only

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
off so I removed and then there was only

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.290 
off so I removed and then there was only
one<00:04:00.690> weft<00:04:00.959> that<00:04:01.410> had<00:04:01.650> one<00:04:02.040> decent<00:04:02.459> so<00:04:02.730> clip<00:04:03.060> and

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
one weft that had one decent so clip and

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.180 
one weft that had one decent so clip and
this<00:04:03.510> one's<00:04:03.720> like<00:04:03.930> pretty<00:04:04.260> sturdy<00:04:04.590> so<00:04:04.980> I

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
this one's like pretty sturdy so I

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.699 
this one's like pretty sturdy so I
decided<00:04:05.700> to<00:04:05.910> keep<00:04:06.090> that<00:04:06.330> one<00:04:06.480> as<00:04:06.660> well<00:04:06.690> now<00:04:07.380> my

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
decided to keep that one as well now my

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.860 
decided to keep that one as well now my
reason<00:04:08.160> for<00:04:08.190> keeping<00:04:08.610> half<00:04:09.510> of<00:04:09.750> the

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
reason for keeping half of the

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.229 
reason for keeping half of the
extensions<00:04:10.530> with<00:04:10.890> clips<00:04:11.550> and<00:04:11.790> half<00:04:12.000> without

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
extensions with clips and half without

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.270 
extensions with clips and half without
is<00:04:12.840> because<00:04:13.200> I'm<00:04:13.350> actually<00:04:13.560> going<00:04:13.770> to<00:04:14.040> pair

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
is because I'm actually going to pair

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.400 
is because I'm actually going to pair
the<00:04:14.430> ones<00:04:14.610> without<00:04:14.790> clips<00:04:15.270> with<00:04:15.630> clips<00:04:15.989> it's

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
the ones without clips with clips it's

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.770 
the ones without clips with clips it's
just<00:04:16.709> so<00:04:16.859> that<00:04:17.010> I<00:04:17.070> have<00:04:17.160> less<00:04:17.640> to<00:04:17.910> sew<00:04:18.120> on<00:04:18.359> and

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
just so that I have less to sew on and

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.390 
just so that I have less to sew on and
I'm<00:04:18.900> going<00:04:19.080> to<00:04:19.290> sew<00:04:19.590> these<00:04:19.859> clips

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
I'm going to sew these clips

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.430 
I'm going to sew these clips
together<00:04:20.639> first<00:04:21.299> you'll<00:04:21.600> just<00:04:21.780> want<00:04:21.989> to<00:04:22.109> align

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
together first you'll just want to align

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.590 
together first you'll just want to align
your<00:04:22.979> webs<00:04:23.310> and<00:04:23.580> make<00:04:23.790> sure<00:04:23.970> that<00:04:24.150> they<00:04:24.330> are

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
your webs and make sure that they are

your webs and make sure that they are
the<00:04:24.630> correct<00:04:25.259> size<00:04:25.560> and<00:04:26.100> that<00:04:26.580> they<00:04:26.729> match

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
the correct size and that they match

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.310 
the correct size and that they match
perfectly<00:04:27.419> and<00:04:27.540> you're<00:04:27.840> just<00:04:28.020> going<00:04:28.139> to<00:04:28.169> go

now<00:04:31.289> by<00:04:31.590> doing<00:04:31.650> this<00:04:32.130> it's<00:04:32.400> going<00:04:32.460> to<00:04:32.639> add<00:04:32.789> a

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
now by doing this it's going to add a

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.879 
now by doing this it's going to add a
lot<00:04:33.210> more<00:04:33.539> volume<00:04:33.870> to<00:04:34.350> your<00:04:34.380> sets<00:04:34.740> of

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
lot more volume to your sets of

extensions especially the ones that
we're<00:04:36.930> really<00:04:37.320> ratty<00:04:37.620> and<00:04:37.979> thinning<00:04:38.280> out<00:04:38.900> see

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
we're really ratty and thinning out see

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.480 
we're really ratty and thinning out see
isn't<00:04:40.139> that<00:04:40.199> so<00:04:40.470> much<00:04:40.620> thicker<00:04:41.009> than<00:04:41.250> just

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
isn't that so much thicker than just

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.850 
isn't that so much thicker than just
this<00:04:41.639> itself<00:04:42.060> so<00:04:42.810> now<00:04:42.840> with<00:04:43.199> my<00:04:43.350> needle<00:04:43.740> and

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
you get to this section of your weft

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.550 
you get to this section of your weft
that<00:05:21.150> doesn't<00:05:21.539> have<00:05:21.660> any<00:05:21.810> clips<00:05:22.080> you<00:05:22.289> want<00:05:22.410> to

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
that doesn't have any clips you want to

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.110 
that doesn't have any clips you want to
first<00:05:22.740> open<00:05:23.009> your<00:05:23.220> clip<00:05:23.550> and<00:05:23.820> make<00:05:23.940> sure

first open your clip and make sure

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.659 
first open your clip and make sure
you're<00:05:24.300> sewing<00:05:24.690> it<00:05:24.780> the<00:05:24.930> right<00:05:25.110> way<00:05:25.320> so<00:05:25.650> sew<00:05:26.520> it

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669 
you're sewing it the right way so sew it

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:28.790 
you're sewing it the right way so sew it
with<00:05:26.699> the<00:05:27.030> teeth<00:05:27.270> facing<00:05:27.690> away<00:05:28.050> from<00:05:28.229> the<00:05:28.560> weft

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
with the teeth facing away from the weft

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.620 
with the teeth facing away from the weft
because<00:05:29.370> it<00:05:29.520> needs<00:05:29.699> to<00:05:29.789> clip<00:05:30.060> into<00:05:30.210> your<00:05:30.419> hair

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630
