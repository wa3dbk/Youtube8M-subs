00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.280
 i 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.850
 hello today we're going to talk again about 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.039
 of plants vs zombies that franchise that 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.420
 became super popular in 2010 and the 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.369
 last year everyone returned it to 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.150
 play because it came out on ios android and 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.150
 also 2002 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.410
 1 this year the zombies return with 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.720
 planes that are visitable in equal fert 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.280
 that his first fruit to be a person 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.840
 to tell the truth has been available in 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.090
 the last months for xbox but it does 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.890
 little came out for pc and is about to leave 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.060
 for playstation 4 so like a 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.830
 people who will never be playing 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.239
 I think it's time to analyze them and 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.540
 tell them sergio is worth it what 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.540
 buy 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.699
 this time there is no campaign mode just 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.260
 games in multiplayer the only 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.449
 story behind the game is that the crazy 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.119
 of buying houses surrounded by cemeteries 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.470
 because he's crazy and there's a new leader of 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.110
 the zombies that wants to destroy the 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.759
 plants so as always the zombies 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.619
 come to attack and the plants have to 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.750
 defend yourself with your chlorophyll arsenal 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.820
 you have to do a dozen modes of 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.259
 game the first is where the plants 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.390
 They have to protect their garden and 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.640
 survive the waves of enemies that 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.220
 include the yeti zombies and the bear my 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.990
 disc the other multiplayer modes you 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.330
 allow for the first time to be part of the 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.970
 zombie army you can choose between 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.950
 four types of characters on each side 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.899
 each one has unique abilities that 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.360
 they are balanced in a non-symmetrical way 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.580
 so for example the doctor in the 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.920
 plants is the sunflower that uses a ray of 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.840
 light to heal one plant at a time but 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.369
 he also has a machine gun and lightning 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.679
 ultra powerful long-range solar 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.630
 while not zombies the doctor is the 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:53.550
 scientist who has a source of 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.380
 plasma that heals little by little at all 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.200
 zombies nearby but at the same time has 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.580
 grenades and a short-range shotgun 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.220
 this creates an interesting balance since 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.280
 Each class has its pros 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.540
 cons very marked 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.729
 The great thing about this game is that it's not 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.890
 matter which class they choose I assure you that 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.650
 they see themselves invest a lot and right now I'm going 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.300
 to choose the engineer that for me is one 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.450
 of the deadliest who have their photo 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.130
 to good air and now you can also 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.569
 use your hydraulic cut with which 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.970
 you can go faster by all 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.290
 scenario and also has other 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.959
 project skills you can stop him 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:45.070
 do you see now let's see each one 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:45.070
 of the plants of this plant 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.829
 and now I'm playing with the plants and 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.180
 in favorite plant is the sunflower that 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.310
 You can pull the closure Sunbeam 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.409
 Now I'm planting to use 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.040
 Andy women dies for the power of the 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:58.599
 chlorophyll and light 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.680
 It is very fun to discover the 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.329
 skills each 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.530
 characters and whenever you change from 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:05.469
 sides feel that the style of play 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.030
 It varies considerably at the end of each 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:08.829
 level will be treated coins for your 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.510
 shares which may be redeemed 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:12.939
 for packages of figurines just like you 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.920
 world album every letter has you new 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:16.359
 Disguises are visas weapons and plants 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.230
 specials that you can plant in the 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.269
 battlefield 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.220
 what you do not fear that in other games 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.900
 multiplayer is the essential thing that is the 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.239
 teamwork to survive in the 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.549
 online battles a well-formed group and 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:31.150
 coordinated between doctors and soldiers is 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:34.000
 almost invincible the game uses engine 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.099
 graphic of 2004 although the cartoon art 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.769
 of a very particular aspect which 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:40.269
 I personally loved some 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.069
 complaints with the voice chat system 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.200
 that stops activating without my permission and 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.329
 I had a couple of connection problems that 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.250
 are not alien to the genre now 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:50.829
 objectively speaking, it's just a 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.150
 much bigger and impressive game but 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:54.310
 the fun I had with clark of 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.260
 workforce was equivalent and that cost 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.780
 only one third of the normal price do 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.910
 make it a very striking offer 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.530
 what you have is an excellent shooter 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.600
 that is totally crazy has a 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.430
 good shot mechanics excellent 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.209
 varies of skills and most importantly 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.209
 that is super fun 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.209
 the revenge version of warfare is a 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.500
 shooter that will surprise you the variety 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.030
 of units is not just a change 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.789
 aesthetic but that the dynamics in which 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.919
 creates is very entertaining is true that no 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:28.050
 will replace banfield or call of duty 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:29.759
 but that first shooter in which you 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.680
 mom will not be behind you saying that 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:34.009
 it is pure killing pure war and fiber 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.009
 blood
