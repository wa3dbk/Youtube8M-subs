00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:06.400
 healthy today a few words about not too 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:10.120
 my friend's car was not so long ago 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:12.700
 acquired this wagon 93 year 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.669
 on the mechanic 2 liters slx I want you 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.800
 tell and the main differences from cashback 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:20.500
 and from the sedan because the car at all 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:25.020
 different though ruler 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:28.050
 gamma 1 well, specifically for this car 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:31.000
 body index and body w10 she 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.219
 It was produced from 90 to 98 year on 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.329
 historic homeland in japan at that time 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:37.780
 like a sedan and hatchback 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:41.440
 they were released UK right away 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.449
 can notice up to that if we always she 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.059
 more such a petty design yes that is 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:50.859
 rounded turn signals here they are already 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:54.460
 Japanese skewed here it can be seen well 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:58.510
 so basically the hood grille 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:01.629
 bumper standard but exceptional 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:05.500
 feature precisely on the headlights is 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:09.810
 here are bevelled turn signals on what 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.229
 suspension here rack type mcpherson 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.899
 lower arm 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:18.740
 stabilizer bar all 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:21.290
 in principle, simple and understandable yes 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.119
 on the rear suspension rear stands here 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:27.759
 beam 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:29.659
 ordinary beam spring dampers and 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:33.649
 transverse jet thrust 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:36.080
 while the sedan front has 3 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:36.649
 Lever stands behind and independent 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.259
 suspension 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:41.030
 what gives stability and controllability but 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.590
 at the same time it requires more 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:47.810
 service but she rulitsya better 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.500
 here is a simple cheap suspension 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:55.280
 Well, do not say that I'm cheap for them year 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:58.369
 less service especially rear well she 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.119
 and the steering wheel and quite differently yes but in 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:04.940
 principle machine workhorse in 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:11.940
 let's show you the trunk 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:13.650
 trunk we remove the rear shelf not to say 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.880
 that he is particularly roomy yes that is 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.000
 loading height 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:21.060
 reduced well in principle 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.230
 also rear seats 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.390
 there is a flat floor 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.610
 carry any goods putting something in 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.120
 principle machine for this and created 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:36.590
 for the carriage of all passenger cargo 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:40.280
 round let's open the hood 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.280
 let's see what's under the hood 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:02.400
 but under the hood we do not have a Samara twin 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:04.980
 cam with from 20 engine drive timing chain in 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.440
 principle reliably trouble-free engine 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:12.420
 very high-torque 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:14.340
 moment that is, in the city at 5 50 60 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.990
 without consequences principle pulls with any 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.360
 transfer 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.450
 obvious such he has special shortcomings 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.450
 Basically no 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.180
 timely service replacement 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:29.940
 oil filters and it will serve you 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.920
 faithfully overheating in principle not 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.280
 afraid already tested just not on this 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.230
 the car here is the most decent engines i 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.320
 I consider it for this type of car 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:43.650
 on the station wagon 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:47.700
 Well, of course consumption 1011 when 12 by 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:50.730
 to the city, but at full load 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.880
 Yes, in principle, pulls out without problems 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:58.049
 Rides I think the engine in principle 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.720
 worthy very much like this all in 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.860
 principle 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.170
 from more that I wanted to mention 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.850
 especially his principle no no 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:10.709
 just timely service 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:12.980
 oil change and 3 engine resource 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.980
 highly 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.720
 what about the cabin we firstly at all 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.820
 premieres 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.810
 there is a tough feature 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:28.729
 the clutch pedal here account is already on 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.120
 This machine has changed once broke 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:34.760
 cable is connected with the fact that hard 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.520
 the petals on the basket are treated so that 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.639
 changing basket put softer and 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:43.490
 In principle, the problem is solved then there is 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:47.350
 pop-up pop-up feature 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:51.470
 speed to fifth gear is connected with the 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:54.650
 the wear of the son of synchrony in principle with 93 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:57.590
 years they solved this problem on this 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.960
 this car was not seen that is 5 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.600
 does not pop up 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:06.020
 but so wanted to be noted very soft 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:09.250
 plastic modern foreign cars yes to 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:12.139
 torpedo on the doors so soft 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.220
 plastic is no longer found on any 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:15.500
 modern foreign cars 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:19.880
 that is, it says something about quality 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:22.630
 materials of the time those are japanese bread 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:25.340
 the assembly is immediately visible 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:29.990
 rich complete set in principle there is everything 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:33.860
 gur cushion about with fully electric package 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:35.650
 Well now of course a lot is not here 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.380
 works if so here 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:41.440
 figure it out bring it to mind 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:45.320
 will have to climb a ride on the analysis 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:48.800
 because there are already problems 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.229
 electrics not falling right 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.289
 window regulator 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:58.430
 also mirror right janitor not working 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:06:03.620
 back well, in principle, I think that's a minus 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:05.270
 these cars it if need be 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.700
 You need to find a spare part 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:10.520
 will have to travel all the analysis 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:13.039
 and not the fact that you find them understand but 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.900
 but here the car is 20 years old and here in 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:16.580
 Basically no squeaks 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:21.289
 nothing rattles no rumbles no 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:24.919
 straining ear doesn't cut if taking new 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:26.750
 you then already after 1 2 thousand already starting 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:30.490
 from jingle salon 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:33.680
 but again in the vase spare parts availability 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:36.560
 Well, here, in principle, good 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.310
 high-torque engine even on it 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.030
 wagon 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:43.490
 anyway very stiff suspension well she 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:45.680
 compared softer than a sedan but 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.480
 compared with vases here of course tough 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.330
 suspension 

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:51.370
 Well, but she rulitsya basically more 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:55.790
 less worthy 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:58.100
 less rolls but so if you compare 

00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:02.120
 hatchback sedan here at all 

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:05.600
 different strands already laid if that's 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:08.500
 visually front panel to clear 

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:12.230
 there seems to be no difference but if 

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:13.610
 understand yes then there are blocks 

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.680
 fuses and relays 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:18.560
 sensors they are located in different places 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:22.000
 compared to a sedan, also booth times 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:24.230
 quite different saloon than sedan and 

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.220
 so we can say that it is quite 

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:28.190
 different cars 

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:31.340
 but the owner has been driving for half a year in principle 

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:33.770
 I only changed the oil filter replaced 

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:36.560
 then replaced one right ball 

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:39.430
 that's the only thing for straw yet 

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:41.990
 did not do anything by electrics 

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:44.060
 Well, that's basically all if you 

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:45.700
 liked put likes maybe even 

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:49.450
 gash something 

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.450
 good luck to you all
