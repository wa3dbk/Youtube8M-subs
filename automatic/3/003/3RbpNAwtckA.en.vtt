watch your videos I don't know I guess I
would<00:02:23.970> just<00:02:24.300> ask<00:02:24.600> that<00:02:25.490> you<00:02:27.020> know<00:02:28.020> perhaps<00:02:28.470> you

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
would just ask that you know perhaps you

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.880 
would just ask that you know perhaps you
just<00:02:29.100> find<00:02:29.459> a<00:02:29.760> better<00:02:29.970> use<00:02:30.240> of<00:02:30.540> your<00:02:30.690> time<00:02:31.260> than

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
just find a better use of your time than

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.870 
just find a better use of your time than
talking<00:02:32.610> about<00:02:32.870> black<00:02:33.870> people<00:02:34.140> in<00:02:34.650> a<00:02:35.370> negative

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
talking about black people in a negative

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.420 
talking about black people in a negative
light<00:02:35.910> I<00:02:36.390> mean<00:02:36.930> we<00:02:37.050> get<00:02:37.200> so<00:02:37.500> much<00:02:37.709> of<00:02:37.770> that<00:02:38.130> in

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
light I mean we get so much of that in

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.540 
light I mean we get so much of that in
our<00:02:38.610> society<00:02:38.910> to<00:02:39.690> have<00:02:39.870> one<00:02:40.350> of<00:02:40.440> our<00:02:40.560> own<00:02:40.860> doing

our society to have one of our own doing

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.140 
our society to have one of our own doing
it<00:02:41.730> it's<00:02:42.239> just<00:02:42.510> very<00:02:42.780> unsettling<00:02:43.590> so<00:02:44.130> you<00:02:45.030> know

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
haven't fully thought out because then

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.720 
haven't fully thought out because then
things<00:03:40.260> like<00:03:40.470> this<00:03:40.830> will<00:03:41.010> happen<00:03:41.220> you<00:03:41.610> know

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
here you know perhaps you should have

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.300
