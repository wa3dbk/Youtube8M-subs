00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.890
 share with you as you can see 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.020
 this rich rich recipe that you are seeing 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.750
 on the screen and sure they are 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.780
 making water in your mouth 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.250
 this is a lot of things this dish 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.850
 but today more than anything I will be 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:38.500
 sharing how to make a rich tofu 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.090
 sauteed a vegetarian dish 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.800
 and then in other videos I will be 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.830
 sharing them too how to do 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.770
 rich mashed potatoes or potatoes 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:50.350
 accompany the tofu with a 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.140
 soy or eggplant milanesas let's go 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:56.590
 to start cutting a little bit of 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.930
 pepper in julienne cut then 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.350
 let's add a little bit of 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.839
 onion also cut in julienne 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:08.140
 Now I'm showing you the tofu that 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.700
 I'm using I 'm a firm tofu because 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.430
 we do not want a soft one that we 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.890
 undo but as good comes 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.710
 packaged with water we are going to drain it 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.509
 and then we're going to know a little bit about 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.729
 texture of the tofu I wanted to show you that 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:24.880
 It looks a lot like the texture of a cheese 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:27.340
 fresh although blowing a white cheese 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.789
 mozzarella as you want to say that it 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.050
 sheds easily as just 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:33.820
 the cheese 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.100
 Let's continue to drain a little bit the 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.830
 water that brings this so that we do not get 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.560
 then to this we will pass a table 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.380
 of chopping we are going to cut slices to 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.009
 about two and a half centimeters 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:50.380
 and then we are going to cut some sticks and 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:53.170
 then we are going to cut some pieces 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.310
 square let's warm our 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.390
 pan to a fire between medium and high 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.280
 adding three tablespoons 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.130
 approximately extra virgin oil 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.200
 olive and wait for these to get brown 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.670
 a little bit but remember that I do not know 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.729
 lose nutrition do not make the 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.069
 vegetables disappear please do not 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.800
 We will be arranging our tofu to 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.530
 the preparation and we will expect that 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.500
 they begin to barely brown 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.180
 the edges this is cooking very fast 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.190
 girl, we are going to be adding a 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.989
 black pepper if you use white 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.670
 You can add white pepper too 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.489
 but I love black pepper 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.530
 a little salt in my case I use salt 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.510
 marine that is much healthier than 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.099
 normal health and we will also be 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.579
 adding a little garlic powder 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.590
 but this I did not show them and so 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:44.769
 the tofu is cooked as you can see 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.079
 Doradito already looks good tasty now 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:50.500
 I invite you to try it on 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:53.410
 home to tell me how they were 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.030
 it's very very nutritious and there's also 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.740
 many other dishes that you can 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.560

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.900

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.210
 show of the plate to serve I hope 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.440
