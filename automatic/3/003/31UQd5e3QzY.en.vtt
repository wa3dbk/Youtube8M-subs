Hi guys, its Cindy Lietz, your Polymer Clay
Tutor, and today’s Studio Tip, we are talking

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:16.920
about Conditioning Hard Polymer Clay - Tip
#2 Using Oil.Now, in a previous video I showed

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.700
you how you could take some hard Polymer clay…like
this old block of Fimo soft…how nice…I

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.520
called it Fimo not so soft, but I showed you
how you could use a hammer to condition it,

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.050
in this one, I’m gonna show you something
else, now this Fimo…I couldn’t find any

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.110
Premo that was hard and dried up, ‘cause
I use Premo quite a bit, but this old block

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:47.070
of Fimo is just… just about like dust and
it is very difficult to try to take that and

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.840
run it through your pasta machine, or even
work with it at all.So, one thing you can

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.010
do is you can add a little bit of oil to it,
now it doesn’t really matter that much what

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:05.840
kind of oil you use, you can use the official
Sculpey Clay Softener and it’s an oil-based

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.170
softener, or you can use mineral oil, this
is a very old bottle… it’s been around

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.859
for a very long time, of mineral oil, or you
can use baby oil…

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:24.259
I haven’t had babies for a long time so
this bottle is also old, but it’s an unscented

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.149
one, so that you’re not putting a scent
into your clay, but it doesn’t really matter

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:33.560
what kind you use.It can be very messy if
you just try to put it on top and mix it with

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.079
your hands, so I’m gonna put it into a little
Ziploc bag here and I’m gonna break it up

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:48.679
a bit, so that it’s easier to work with,
and we’re gonna add just one drop at a time

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:55.539
of whatever oil we want to.I don’t know
about the other oils like vegetable oils or

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:01.609
things like that, it probably would work too,
but I haven’t tested it, so I can’t tell

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:06.840
you for sure.So I’m just gonna put one or
two drops in…oops, that’s a little too

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.900
much, so I’m gonna take a little of that
out, there, alright, so now, what we’re

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.580
gonna do is we’re gonna try to mix it up
in the bag here, and get that oil working

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.290
in...if I do this in my hands, it gets all...my
hands will be looking like an alien in no

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:32.340
time.Now, if you can’t get it to work, you
can try squashing it up, and start breaking

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:41.140
it up with something else, like this roller,
and, it works pretty good, it’s messy like

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:48.349
I said, but it works quite good to start incorporating
that oil back into the clay, and you can see

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:56.579
now, it’s not even as… quite as brittle
as it was before.We’ll just keep working

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:02.189
it in, if you have a lot of it, you can work
with a bigger bag, now I’m gonna just bring

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:07.810
it out on to my surface and work with my hands,
of course they’re gonna turn Green but that’s

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:23.290
alright.Let’s just take this outta here,
there are lots of different ways, and I’ll

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.959
be adding more and more tips on different
ways to condition hard clay, this is just

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:33.920
one of them.So I’m just gonna work it together…
seemed a little… like it wasn’t moving

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.180
very well in there, so once you get working...see
what I mean by getting on your hands, once

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.440
you get it worked in there...depending on
the hardness of the clay, it could be easier

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:53.840
or harder to do, you can actually get it right
down to the point where it’s soft and pliable

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.780
like this here.Now I’ve been working on
this one for a little bit, and you can see

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:05.189
it’s actually a workable block of clay to
work with, you don’t wanna go too far, if

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:10.420
you add too much oil, then you’re back to
needing to leech it out, and it’s too soft,

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:16.540
but, you can get this clay to just keep working
it in.Now, as far as cleaning up your hands...

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.930
‘cause you’ll wanna do that if you ended
up having to work with it, you can just use

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:28.330
something like this, this is a cleaning…kitchen
wipe, you could use baby wipes, they work

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.270
great, and you can get it off your hands again
really easily, see how easy that’s coming

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:38.580
off, and then you can wipe up your surface.So,
you don’t have to use the expensive softeners

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.650
if you don’t want to, just some regular
baby oil or mineral oil will work to soften

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.720
up your clay.So I hope that was helpful for
you, please let me know if you like this video.And

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:55.770

you would like me to teach you in a future

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.880
video, make sure to let me know in the comment
section below.We’ll see you next time and

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:01.560
bye for now.
