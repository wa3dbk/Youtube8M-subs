so we shall get started right you want
to<00:00:26.180> start<00:00:26.930> off<00:00:27.020> the<00:00:27.560> square

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:32.829 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:38.319 

rotate<00:00:33.829> that<00:00:34.040> wound

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.310 

scale<00:00:38.929> it<00:00:38.960> down

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.650 

and<00:00:43.410> change<00:00:44.130> that<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.880> a<00:00:45.390> noisy<00:00:45.690> yellow

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
and change that to a noisy yellow

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.780 
and change that to a noisy yellow
the<00:00:48.230> yellow<00:00:48.470> on<00:00:48.530> here<00:00:48.950> is<00:00:49.280> going<00:00:49.550> to<00:00:49.610> be

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
the yellow on here is going to be

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.570 
the yellow on here is going to be
different<00:00:50.030> to<00:00:50.570> the<00:00:50.690> yellow<00:00:51.130> use<00:00:52.130> as<00:00:52.430> the

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:52.580 
different to the yellow use as the

00:00:52.580 --> 00:01:12.640 
different to the yellow use as the
Batman<00:00:53.090> one<00:00:53.360> they<00:00:53.720> just<00:00:53.900> bear<00:00:54.170> that<00:00:54.320> in<00:00:54.380> mind

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:18.270 

alright<00:01:13.370> then<00:01:13.670> you<00:01:13.970> want<00:01:14.090> to<00:01:14.180> get<00:01:14.390> the<00:01:15.160> overall

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.060 

medium

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
medium

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:29.560 
medium
scale<00:01:22.000> that<00:01:22.300> down

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.359 

so<00:01:30.230> right<00:01:30.470> that

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
so right that

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:54.349 
so right that
then<00:01:33.369> get<00:01:34.299> the<00:01:35.020> come

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:54.359 

00:01:54.359 --> 00:02:00.680 

now<00:01:55.359> you<00:01:55.420> want<00:01:55.780> to<00:01:55.899> get<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:56.740> cricket<00:01:57.549> bat

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.380 

keep<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.440> the<00:02:01.530> same<00:02:01.560> size<00:02:02.040> is<00:02:02.430> you're<00:02:03.300> not

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
keep it the same size is you're not

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.020 
keep it the same size is you're not
going<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.630> see<00:02:03.870> the<00:02:04.140> bit<00:02:04.290> that<00:02:04.320> goes<00:02:04.620> off

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
going to see the bit that goes off

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.410 
going to see the bit that goes off
that's<00:02:06.030> fine

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
that's fine

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.900 
that's fine
maybe<00:02:07.869> bring<00:02:08.259> it<00:02:08.380> down<00:02:08.560> a<00:02:08.590> little<00:02:08.890> bit<00:02:09.130> until

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
maybe bring it down a little bit until

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.180

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.780 

this<00:02:26.300> is<00:02:26.840> going<00:02:27.290> to<00:02:27.379> be<00:02:27.560> what<00:02:27.860> your<00:02:28.040> dribble

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
this is going to be what your dribble

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.000 
this is going to be what your dribble

it's all about

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.550 
it's all about
so<00:02:31.549> you<00:02:31.610> can<00:02:31.879> just<00:02:32.060> turn<00:02:32.299> it<00:02:32.540> round<00:02:32.750> choose

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
so you can just turn it round choose

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:42.080 
so you can just turn it round choose
what<00:02:33.920> a<00:02:33.950> little<00:02:34.220> bit<00:02:34.370> you

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.160 

that'll<00:02:42.870> do<00:02:43.019> no<00:02:43.790> right<00:02:44.790> then<00:02:45.660> you<00:02:45.780> want<00:02:45.930> to

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
that'll do no right then you want to

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.680 
that'll do no right then you want to
change<00:02:46.590> that<00:02:47.099> to<00:02:47.780> black<00:02:48.780> I<00:02:49.080> believe<00:02:49.970> then<00:02:50.970> you

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
change that to black I believe then you

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.860 
change that to black I believe then you
want<00:02:51.900> to<00:02:52.140> duplicate<00:02:52.470> that<00:02:53.120> and<00:02:54.120> change<00:02:54.510> it<00:02:54.840> to

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
want to duplicate that and change it to

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.630 
want to duplicate that and change it to
a<00:02:55.410> different<00:02:55.830> shade<00:02:56.550> of<00:02:56.580> year<00:02:57.090> like<00:02:58.400> let's<00:02:59.400> go

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
a different shade of year like let's go

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.140 
a different shade of year like let's go
for<00:03:00.060> that<00:03:00.390> one<00:03:00.629> that's<00:03:01.230> quite<00:03:01.530> a<00:03:01.650> nice<00:03:01.799> one<00:03:02.150> and

for that one that's quite a nice one and

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.619 
for that one that's quite a nice one and
then<00:03:04.049> move<00:03:05.040> that<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:05.700> you<00:03:06.060> get<00:03:06.209> that<00:03:06.360> really

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
then move that and you get that really

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:11.260 
then move that and you get that really
nice<00:03:06.870> black<00:03:07.650> outline

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.830 

maybe<00:03:11.900> scale<00:03:12.230> it<00:03:12.440> down<00:03:12.470> a<00:03:12.650> little<00:03:12.980> bit
