00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:26.079
 but we're just fans of comic fans. 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.220
 superhero or my little book drink all 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:30.789
 what can cartoons 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:36.190
 here some time is necessary for a long time 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:38.650
 we started to get involved in people always 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:42.280
 our favorite hero of the people color wolverine 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.559
 I thought that wolverine it is an animal 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.949
 not that rude not a bear with long 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:50.610
 when dots I still looked it in 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:54.760
 I think on the internet what kind of animal 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.710
 punitive conditionally speaking he is not like that 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.040
 fantastic like all the other heroes 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.830
 pretty man real 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.689
 superpower is super but really 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.560
 actually and here it is closer to us 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:10.560
 all by nature act 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.680
 spirit of its own so wolverine 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.390
 aaa is really that these are all super 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.350
 heroes they are very cool always 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:24.509
 iron is obtained from scrap because 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:27.149
 that they kind of fit this because 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.030
 which is very interesting that they have all sorts 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:32.420
 these legs once there are all sorts of signs on them 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.159
 Here are beautiful, they are muscular 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.369
 such me it's great of course from metal 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.780
 it turns out the artist to do interesting 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.759
 then of course it would be interesting something 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.159
 wrote a hijack he looked it 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.149
 arrived at the premiere and at the same time opened our 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.149
 the sculpture would be cool
