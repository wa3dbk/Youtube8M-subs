00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.080 
like a why it kind of came up this way
and<00:00:33.649> used<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.710> reciprocating<00:00:34.860> saw<00:00:35.399> with<00:00:35.820> long

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
and used a reciprocating saw with long

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.780 
and used a reciprocating saw with long
blade<00:00:36.420> cut<00:00:36.840> out<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.290> there's<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.520> little

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
blade cut out this there's the little

lip<00:00:39.090> that<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.570> filter<00:00:39.930> sock<00:00:40.200> will<00:00:40.440> go<00:00:40.620> in<00:00:42.440> and

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
lip that the filter sock will go in and

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.860 
lip that the filter sock will go in and
it'll<00:00:44.640> prevent<00:00:45.030> from<00:00:45.239> spilling<00:00:45.600> over<00:00:45.750> the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
it'll prevent from spilling over the

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.220 
it'll prevent from spilling over the
side<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.440> then<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.039> cut<00:00:47.430> this<00:00:47.820> off<00:00:48.120> cracked<00:00:49.079> it

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
side and then I cut this off cracked it

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.020 
side and then I cut this off cracked it
right<00:00:49.350> there<00:00:49.590> but<00:00:49.890> that's<00:00:50.160> alright<00:00:51.890> now<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:53.399> did

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030

right there but that's alright now I did
see<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.719> then<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:56.300> used<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.420> reciprocating

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
see and then I used the reciprocating

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.689 
see and then I used the reciprocating
saw<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.289> hook<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:58.800> out<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.160> then<00:00:59.280> cleaned<00:00:59.579> it

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
saw to hook this out and then cleaned it

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.020 
saw to hook this out and then cleaned it
up<00:00:59.820> with<00:01:00.059> an<00:01:00.180> angle<00:01:00.539> grinder<00:01:00.770> I<00:01:01.789> did<00:01:02.789> make<00:01:03.000> one

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
up with an angle grinder I did make one

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.590 
up with an angle grinder I did make one
modification<00:01:04.729> see<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.880> piece<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.270> acrylic

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
that I put in there I just cut out like

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.020 
that I put in there I just cut out like
a<00:01:09.000> half<00:01:09.299> circle<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.260> just<00:01:11.159> shaved<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.640> up<00:01:11.790> with

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
a half circle and just shaved it up with

a half circle and just shaved it up with
with<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.840> bench<00:01:13.140> grinder<00:01:13.680> until<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.280> fit<00:01:14.490> in

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
with a bench grinder until it fit in

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.359 
with a bench grinder until it fit in
there<00:01:14.790> perfectly<00:01:15.229> I<00:01:16.229> was<00:01:16.740> worried<00:01:17.070> about<00:01:17.159> I

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
there perfectly I was worried about I

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.940 
there perfectly I was worried about I
asked<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.330> guy<00:01:18.540> on<00:01:18.960> one<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.619> YouTube

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
asked the guy on one of the YouTube

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.120 
asked the guy on one of the YouTube
channels<00:01:20.490> who<00:01:20.700> who<00:01:21.210> came<00:01:21.900> up<00:01:22.080> with<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.409> or<00:01:22.590> from

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
channels who who came up with it or from

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.670 
channels who who came up with it or from
what<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.310> could<00:01:23.430> see<00:01:23.580> came<00:01:23.909> up<00:01:24.030> with<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.360> and

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
what I could see came up with it and

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.969 
what I could see came up with it and
asked<00:01:25.680> him<00:01:25.799> about<00:01:26.299> so<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.750> filter<00:01:28.470> stock<00:01:28.710> goes

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
asked him about so the filter stock goes

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.620 
asked him about so the filter stock goes
in<00:01:29.130> here<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.670> this<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:29.909> hanging<00:01:30.270> over<00:01:30.509> the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
in here and this is hanging over the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.050 
in here and this is hanging over the
edge<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.049> aquarium<00:01:31.409> but<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:33.860> didn't<00:01:34.860> know

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
edge of the aquarium but I didn't know

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.390 
edge of the aquarium but I didn't know
if<00:01:36.060> like<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.479> ever<00:01:36.600> backed<00:01:36.990> up<00:01:37.290> if<00:01:37.680> there<00:01:38.220> was<00:01:38.369> a

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
if like it ever backed up if there was a

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.890 
if like it ever backed up if there was a
problem<00:01:38.700> with<00:01:39.060> right<00:01:39.270> here<00:01:39.570> with<00:01:39.750> it

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
problem with right here with it

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.140 
problem with right here with it
overflowing<00:01:40.619> because<00:01:40.970> obviously<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.060> would

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
overflowing because obviously it would

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.069 
overflowing because obviously it would
come<00:01:42.390> out<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.689> tank

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
come out of the tank

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.940 
come out of the tank
so<00:01:43.799> what<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.250> did<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:45.180> help<00:01:45.509> counteract<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.770> I

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
so what I did to help counteract that I

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.340 
so what I did to help counteract that I
dropped<00:01:47.250> see<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.180> dropped<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.780> plate<00:01:49.049> the

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
dropped see I dropped the plate the

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.800 
dropped see I dropped the plate the
piece<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.340> acrylic<00:01:50.549> right<00:01:50.939> down<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:51.750> it

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
piece of acrylic right down to it so it

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.840 
piece of acrylic right down to it so it
should<00:01:52.049> sit<00:01:52.320> flush<00:01:52.649> with<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:53.340> rim<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:55.850> rim

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
should sit flush with the rim of the rim

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.950 
should sit flush with the rim of the rim
of<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.560> of<00:01:58.640> the<00:01:59.640> aquarium<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.329> sump

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
of the of the aquarium of the sump

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.969 
of the of the aquarium of the sump
so<00:02:02.240> that's<00:02:03.240> my<00:02:03.479> little<00:02:03.689> mod<00:02:03.960> for<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:04.439> just<00:02:04.890> a

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
so that's my little mod for that just a

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.570 
so that's my little mod for that just a
quick<00:02:05.189> update

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
quick update

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.930 
quick update
and<00:02:07.410> thought<00:02:08.410> you'd<00:02:08.650> like<00:02:08.830> that<00:02:08.890> there<00:02:09.820> was

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
and thought you'd like that there was

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.050 
and thought you'd like that there was
also<00:02:10.119> two<00:02:10.590> there<00:02:11.590> was<00:02:11.710> two<00:02:11.920> forms<00:02:12.370> of<00:02:12.520> this<00:02:12.670> PVC

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
also two there was two forms of this PVC

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.380 
also two there was two forms of this PVC
one<00:02:13.570> was<00:02:13.750> a<00:02:13.780> really<00:02:14.560> really<00:02:14.770> thick<00:02:15.390> heavy-duty

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
one was a really really thick heavy-duty

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.830 
one was a really really thick heavy-duty
