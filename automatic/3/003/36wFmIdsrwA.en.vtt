conditions<00:01:31.450> out<00:01:31.840> there<00:01:31.869> and<00:01:32.289> a<00:01:32.830> little<00:01:32.950> bit<00:01:33.159> of

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
conditions out there and a little bit of

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.440 
conditions out there and a little bit of
standing<00:01:33.549> water<00:01:33.580> which<00:01:33.909> I<00:01:34.030> think<00:01:34.240> made<00:01:34.330> it

standing water which I think made it

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:35.940 
standing water which I think made it
quite<00:01:34.600> tricky<00:01:34.840> at<00:01:34.990> the<00:01:35.080> start<00:01:35.380> and<00:01:35.530> then<00:01:35.679> you
