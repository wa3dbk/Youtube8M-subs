healthy<00:01:03.090> fats<00:01:03.300> in<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:04.280> works<00:01:05.280> out<00:01:05.509> shake<00:01:06.509> it

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
healthy fats in it so works out shake it

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:16.399 
healthy fats in it so works out shake it
up<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.900> bit<00:01:13.760> and<00:01:14.760> then<00:01:14.970> we'll<00:01:15.150> do<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.840> serving

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
up a bit and then we'll do the serving

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.140 
up a bit and then we'll do the serving
size<00:01:16.620> for<00:01:16.650> this<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.100> three<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.520> half<00:01:17.580> scoops

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
size for this is three and a half scoops

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.660 
size for this is three and a half scoops
so<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:18.990> just<00:01:19.260> do<00:01:19.500> three<00:01:20.250> fucking<00:01:20.790> scoops<00:01:22.520> if<00:01:23.520> you

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
so I just do three fucking scoops if you

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.280 
so I just do three fucking scoops if you
don't<00:01:23.820> know<00:01:23.909> what<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.090> heaping<00:01:24.450> scoop<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:24.960> you

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
don't know what a heaping scoop is you

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.250 
don't know what a heaping scoop is you
should<00:01:25.530> it's<00:01:25.979> just<00:01:26.130> overflowing<00:01:27.110> that's<00:01:28.110> how

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
should it's just overflowing that's how

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.160 
should it's just overflowing that's how
you<00:01:28.290> should<00:01:28.440> use<00:01:28.740> all<00:01:28.920> your<00:01:29.040> scoops<00:01:30.170> that's

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
you should use all your scoops that's

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:39.469 
you should use all your scoops that's
what<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.380> prefer<00:01:31.650> at<00:01:31.920> least<00:01:37.909> we'll<00:01:38.909> do<00:01:39.150> three<00:01:39.450> of

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
what I prefer at least we'll do three of

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.420 
what I prefer at least we'll do three of
those<00:01:39.659> so<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.200> probably<00:01:40.440> comes<00:01:40.680> out<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.130> closer

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
those so it probably comes out to closer

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:52.399 
those so it probably comes out to closer
to<00:01:41.670> four<00:01:41.940> scoops<00:01:50.119> shake<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.299> up<00:01:51.330> a<00:01:51.600> bit<00:01:51.630> it

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
to four scoops shake that up a bit it

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.800 
to four scoops shake that up a bit it
actually<00:01:52.590> makes<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.189> pretty<00:01:53.430> easy<00:01:53.549> for<00:01:54.240> the

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
actually makes it pretty easy for the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.500 
actually makes it pretty easy for the
amount<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.170> powder<00:01:55.380> that's<00:01:55.740> in<00:01:55.950> there<00:01:56.510> which

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
amount of powder that's in there which

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.450 
amount of powder that's in there which
is<00:01:57.540> good<00:01:58.140> for<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.380> weight<00:01:58.560> gainer<00:01:58.590> goes<00:01:59.189> down

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
is good for a weight gainer goes down

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.149 
is good for a weight gainer goes down
easy<00:02:01.100> so<00:02:02.100> make<00:02:02.250> sure<00:02:02.310> there's<00:02:02.580> no<00:02:02.700> clone<00:02:04.159> and

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
easy so make sure there's no clone and

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.210 
easy so make sure there's no clone and
what<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.369> do<00:02:05.490> is<00:02:05.930> instead<00:02:06.930> of<00:02:06.990> drinking<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:07.680> I'll

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
what I do is instead of drinking it I'll

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.309 
what I do is instead of drinking it I'll
add<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.519> to<00:02:09.110> a<00:02:10.110> bowl<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.560> cereal<00:02:11.219> so<00:02:12.319> cereals

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
add it to a bowl of cereal so cereals

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.379 
add it to a bowl of cereal so cereals
easy<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.769> eat<00:02:13.950> it's<00:02:14.579> a<00:02:14.639> great<00:02:14.849> way<00:02:14.969> to<00:02:15.029> get<00:02:15.209> some

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:15.389 
easy to eat it's a great way to get some

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:18.110 
easy to eat it's a great way to get some
extra<00:02:15.629> calories<00:02:16.169> in<00:02:16.819> and<00:02:17.819> then<00:02:17.969> I'll<00:02:18.090> just

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
extra calories in and then I'll just

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.819 
extra calories in and then I'll just
drink<00:02:18.540> whatever<00:02:18.779> is<00:02:19.019> left<00:02:19.260> in<00:02:19.439> the<00:02:19.529> bowl<00:02:19.709> after

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:21.829 
drink whatever is left in the bowl after

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:24.470 
drink whatever is left in the bowl after
so<00:02:22.829> it's<00:02:23.040> like<00:02:23.189> a<00:02:23.219> chocolate<00:02:23.700> milk<00:02:23.879> basically

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.860 
so it's like a chocolate milk basically
and<00:02:25.010> what<00:02:26.010> I<00:02:26.040> have<00:02:26.310> in<00:02:26.489> the<00:02:26.579> bowl<00:02:26.790> is<00:02:27.090> just<00:02:29.870> some

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870
