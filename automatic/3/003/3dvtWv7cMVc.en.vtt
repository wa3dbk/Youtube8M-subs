the<00:00:53.609> actual<00:00:53.820> gameplay<00:00:54.420> I'm<00:00:54.960> actually

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
the actual gameplay I'm actually

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.619 
the actual gameplay I'm actually
thinking<00:00:55.859> it's<00:00:56.190> probably<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.609> beta<00:00:56.969> test<00:00:57.390> it's

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
thinking it's probably a beta test it's

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.689 
thinking it's probably a beta test it's
not<00:00:58.109> actually<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.769> actual<00:00:59.190> gameplay<00:00:59.460> of

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
not actually the actual gameplay of

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.700

would literally maybe to 10 minutes to
make<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.280> was<00:01:29.429> like<00:01:29.550> an<00:01:29.700> extended<00:01:30.149> version<00:01:30.270> of

make it was like an extended version of
a<00:01:30.599> mission<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.080> if<00:01:32.039> they<00:01:32.459> were<00:01:32.520> gonna<00:01:32.729> release

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
believe the pc version is going to be

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.979

looking<00:04:14.100> around<00:04:14.370> two<00:04:14.609> or<00:04:14.640> three<00:04:14.880> month<00:04:15.060> period

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.789 
because obviously these things do take a
long<00:04:18.000> time<00:04:18.180> to<00:04:18.239> make<00:04:18.570> and<00:04:18.870> if<00:04:19.380> it's<00:04:19.530> gonna<00:04:19.620> be

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
long time to make and if it's gonna be

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.620

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 
know the answer that question I honestly

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.130 
know the answer that question I honestly
don't<00:05:03.530> know<00:05:03.710> I<00:05:04.220> Maya<00:05:05.000> mine<00:05:05.330> isn't<00:05:05.780> on<00:05:05.960> that

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.140 
don't know I Maya mine isn't on that

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.660 
don't know I Maya mine isn't on that
right<00:05:06.350> now<00:05:06.380> and<00:05:06.530> I<00:05:06.890> wouldn't<00:05:07.220> think<00:05:07.340> about<00:05:07.460> it

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:07.670 
right now and I wouldn't think about it

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.100 
right now and I wouldn't think about it
but<00:05:07.820> to<00:05:08.150> give<00:05:08.360> you<00:05:08.480> a<00:05:08.510> little<00:05:08.750> bit<00:05:08.900> of<00:05:08.990> a

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
but to give you a little bit of a

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:10.750 
but to give you a little bit of a
speculation<00:05:09.650> about<00:05:10.040> what<00:05:10.310> I<00:05:10.550> would<00:05:10.730> be

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
speculation about what I would be

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.840 
speculation about what I would be
thinking<00:05:11.270> is<00:05:11.590> they<00:05:12.590> would<00:05:12.740> possibly<00:05:13.010> add<00:05:13.490> new

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
thinking is they would possibly add new

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.850 
thinking is they would possibly add new
modes<00:05:14.180> but<00:05:14.450> I<00:05:14.510> do<00:05:14.630> not<00:05:15.050> know<00:05:15.290> what<00:05:15.530> what<00:05:15.770> is

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
modes but I do not know what what is

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.380 
modes but I do not know what what is
your<00:05:16.040> thoughts<00:05:16.250> on<00:05:16.430> that<00:05:16.460> quick<00:05:16.760> timing<00:05:17.150> I

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.390 
your thoughts on that quick timing I

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:18.790 
your thoughts on that quick timing I
think<00:05:18.050> they're<00:05:18.170> gonna<00:05:18.230> add<00:05:18.440> some<00:05:18.680> new

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
think they're gonna add some new

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.320 
think they're gonna add some new
features<00:05:19.040> into<00:05:19.550> it<00:05:19.670> so<00:05:19.820> you<00:05:19.910> can<00:05:20.030> add<00:05:20.150> like

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
features into it so you can add like

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.090 
features into it so you can add like
maybe<00:05:20.510> new<00:05:20.750> ramps<00:05:21.200> and<00:05:21.320> kind<00:05:21.500> of<00:05:21.590> things<00:05:21.950> like

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
maybe new ramps and kind of things like

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.910 
maybe new ramps and kind of things like
go<00:05:22.310> i<00:05:22.610> dunno<00:05:22.970> maybe<00:05:23.180> up<00:05:23.480> and<00:05:23.810> just<00:05:24.440> start<00:05:24.680> to<00:05:24.770> do

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:24.920 
go i dunno maybe up and just start to do

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.770 
go i dunno maybe up and just start to do
maybe<00:05:25.250> stance<00:05:25.700> on<00:05:25.880> and<00:05:26.060> stuff<00:05:26.210> i<00:05:26.330> think<00:05:26.570> that

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
maybe stance on and stuff i think that

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.370 
maybe stance on and stuff i think that
maybe<00:05:27.260> like<00:05:27.530> higher<00:05:27.830> ramps<00:05:28.370> up<00:05:28.490> yeah<00:05:28.790> okay<00:05:29.380> yes

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 
maybe like higher ramps up yeah okay yes

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:31.780 
maybe like higher ramps up yeah okay yes
i<00:05:30.560> think<00:05:30.590> we're<00:05:30.860> gonna<00:05:30.950> see<00:05:31.160> some<00:05:31.400> more<00:05:31.430> you

i think we're gonna see some more you
know<00:05:31.880> future<00:05:32.150> stuff<00:05:32.480> on<00:05:32.660> that<00:05:32.810> and<00:05:33.020> hopefully

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:56.600 
quick timing now this is actually a

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.810 
quick timing now this is actually a
really<00:05:56.780> good<00:05:56.900> one<00:05:57.290> funny<00:05:57.890> funny<00:05:58.190> one<00:05:58.460> it<00:05:58.670> was

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:58.820 
really good one funny funny one it was

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.160 
really good one funny funny one it was
actually<00:05:59.180> when<00:05:59.330> we<00:05:59.510> were<00:05:59.660> very<00:05:59.870> little

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:00.170 
actually when we were very little

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.080 
actually when we were very little
youtubers<00:06:00.770> I<00:06:00.890> think<00:06:01.160> quick<00:06:01.430> timing<00:06:01.730> was<00:06:01.880> about

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.090 
youtubers I think quick timing was about

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.340 
youtubers I think quick timing was about
at<00:06:02.240> 10k<00:06:02.750> and<00:06:03.050> I<00:06:03.710> was<00:06:03.980> about<00:06:04.190> at<00:06:04.400> 6k<00:06:04.850> and<00:06:05.300> it<00:06:06.110> was

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:06.350 
at 10k and I was about at 6k and it was

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.470 
at 10k and I was about at 6k and it was
the<00:06:06.380> beginning<00:06:06.620> of<00:06:06.920> GTA<00:06:07.820> we<00:06:08.120> were<00:06:08.270> just

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:08.480 
the beginning of GTA we were just

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.420 
the beginning of GTA we were just
leaving<00:06:08.690> black<00:06:09.260> ops<00:06:09.500> 2<00:06:09.770> actually<00:06:10.220> we<00:06:10.340> were
