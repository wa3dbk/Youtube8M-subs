garden<00:00:32.300> I've<00:00:33.300> had<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:33.690> many<00:00:33.809> people<00:00:34.200> come<00:00:34.350> by

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
garden I've had so many people come by

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.170 
garden I've had so many people come by
looking<00:00:34.920> at<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.100> tomatoes<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.730> they<00:00:35.790> look<00:00:36.030> at

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
looking at the tomatoes and they look at

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.610 
looking at the tomatoes and they look at
them<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.420> they<00:00:36.510> say<00:00:36.690> wow<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:37.110> can't<00:00:37.410> grow

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
them and they say wow I can't grow

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.350 
them and they say wow I can't grow
tomatoes<00:00:37.829> like<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.489> I've<00:00:38.670> haven't<00:00:39.059> had<00:00:39.180> much

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
tomatoes like that I've haven't had much

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.410 
tomatoes like that I've haven't had much
success<00:00:39.770> so<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:40.800> thought<00:00:41.219> we'd<00:00:41.430> do<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.730> video

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
success so I thought we'd do is a video

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.810 
success so I thought we'd do is a video
on<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.780> explaining<00:00:43.649> exactly<00:00:43.770> what<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.250> did<00:00:44.579> to

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
on it explaining exactly what I did to

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.880 
on it explaining exactly what I did to
get<00:00:44.969> these<00:00:45.149> results<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:46.410> way<00:00:46.559> they<00:00:46.710> can<00:00:46.860> be

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
get these results that way they can be

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.200 
get these results that way they can be
assured<00:00:47.219> that<00:00:47.250> they<00:00:47.520> will<00:00:47.670> have<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.969> same

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
assured that they will have the same

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.729 
assured that they will have the same
results<00:00:50.030> there<00:00:51.030> are<00:00:51.149> two<00:00:51.449> things<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:52.079> common

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
results there are two things in common

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.069 
results there are two things in common
that<00:00:52.770> all<00:00:53.070> these<00:00:53.309> plants<00:00:53.610> have<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.840> is

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
that all these plants have and that is

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.869 
that all these plants have and that is
the<00:00:55.379> container<00:00:55.739> in<00:00:55.890> which<00:00:56.039> they<00:00:56.250> were<00:00:56.309> planted

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
the container in which they were planted

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.889 
the container in which they were planted
and<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.660> soil<00:00:57.960> mix<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:58.530> use<00:00:59.600> the<00:01:00.600> first

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
and the soil mix that I use the first

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.049 
and the soil mix that I use the first
let's<00:01:01.620> discuss<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.520> dirt<00:01:02.789> pot

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
let's discuss it is the dirt pot

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.960 
let's discuss it is the dirt pot
Hydrofarm<00:01:04.010> makes<00:01:05.010> this<00:01:05.159> dirt<00:01:05.400> pot<00:01:05.640> which<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:05.820> a

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
Hydrofarm makes this dirt pot which is a

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.539 
Hydrofarm makes this dirt pot which is a
fabric<00:01:06.479> pot<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:07.619> all<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.950> these<00:01:08.070> tomatoes

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
fabric pot that all of these tomatoes

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.280 
fabric pot that all of these tomatoes
are<00:01:08.670> planted<00:01:09.060> in<00:01:09.210> now<00:01:09.479> they<00:01:09.630> range<00:01:09.990> in<00:01:10.229> size

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
are planted in now they range in size

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.740 
are planted in now they range in size
from<00:01:10.530> three<00:01:11.310> gallon<00:01:11.760> all<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.180> way<00:01:12.330> up<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.570> two

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
from three gallon all the way up to two

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.210 
from three gallon all the way up to two
hundred<00:01:12.780> gallon<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.500> are<00:01:13.710> available<00:01:13.920> here

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
hundred gallon that are available here

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.969 
hundred gallon that are available here
at<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.460> nursery<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.810> tomatoes<00:01:16.290> are<00:01:16.439> grown<00:01:16.650> in

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
at the nursery the tomatoes are grown in

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.730 
at the nursery the tomatoes are grown in
thirty<00:01:17.670> gallon<00:01:18.090> sizes<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.840> forty<00:01:19.500> five

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
thirty gallon sizes and forty five

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.160 
thirty gallon sizes and forty five
gallon<00:01:20.189> sizes<00:01:20.479> and<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.570> beautiful<00:01:21.990> thing

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
gallon sizes and the beautiful thing

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.620 
gallon sizes and the beautiful thing
about<00:01:22.200> these<00:01:22.619> things<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.880> they<00:01:24.299> really

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
about these things is that they really

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.929 
about these things is that they really
produce<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.409> lot<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.770> roots<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.310> reason<00:01:26.670> is

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
produce a lot of roots and the reason is

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.789 
produce a lot of roots and the reason is
that<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.330> get<00:01:27.540> air<00:01:27.750> circulating<00:01:28.530> through<00:01:28.770> the

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
that you get air circulating through the

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.679 
that you get air circulating through the
sides<00:01:29.159> through<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.850> bottom<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.360> through<00:01:30.540> the

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
sides through the bottom and through the

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.350 
sides through the bottom and through the
top<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.770> provides<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.369> lot<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.549> oxygen<00:01:33.210> to

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
top so it provides a lot of oxygen to

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.719 
top so it provides a lot of oxygen to
the<00:01:33.479> root<00:01:33.689> systems<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:35.100> that's<00:01:35.250> what<00:01:35.520> leads

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
the root systems and that's what leads

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.510 
the root systems and that's what leads
us<00:01:35.880> into<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.210> next<00:01:36.650> aspect<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.920> this<00:01:38.070> value

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
us into the next aspect of this value

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.749 
us into the next aspect of this value
and<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:40.049> rooting<00:01:40.409> properties<00:01:40.890> what

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
and that is the rooting properties what

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.399 
and that is the rooting properties what
happens<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.390> roots<00:01:42.630> try<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:42.990> get<00:01:43.229> outside

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
happens is the roots try to get outside

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.530 
happens is the roots try to get outside
this<00:01:43.979> bag<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.579> when<00:01:44.850> they<00:01:44.939> can't<00:01:45.210> get<00:01:45.390> outside

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
this bag and when they can't get outside

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.359 
this bag and when they can't get outside
of<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.140> tips<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.530> them<00:01:46.619> are<00:01:46.740> stunted<00:01:47.220> and

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
of the tips of them are stunted and

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.690 
of the tips of them are stunted and
that's<00:01:47.579> triggers<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.299> response<00:01:48.799> to<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:50.460> main

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
that's triggers a response to the main

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.730 
that's triggers a response to the main
root<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.509> start<00:01:51.780> sending<00:01:52.140> out<00:01:52.259> additional

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
root to start sending out additional

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.160 
root to start sending out additional
clients<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:53.759> what<00:01:53.970> happens<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:55.020> get

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
clients and so what happens is you get

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.580 
clients and so what happens is you get
this<00:01:55.409> massive<00:01:55.799> root<00:01:56.250> system<00:01:57.380> inside<00:01:58.380> this

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
this massive root system inside this

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.510 
this massive root system inside this
container<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:00.060> need<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.689> support<00:02:01.110> a

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
container that you need to support a

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.280 
container that you need to support a
plant<00:02:02.520> like<00:02:02.700> this<00:02:02.880> which<00:02:03.090> is<00:02:03.270> six<00:02:03.540> seven<00:02:04.049> feet

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
plant like this which is six seven feet

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.859 
plant like this which is six seven feet
tall<00:02:04.549> so<00:02:05.549> it's<00:02:05.670> just<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.939> great<00:02:06.210> great<00:02:06.479> thing

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
tall so it's just a great great thing

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.850 
tall so it's just a great great thing
here<00:02:07.429> I<00:02:08.429> would<00:02:08.879> like<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.209> talk<00:02:09.390> now<00:02:09.720> about<00:02:09.959> soil

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
here I would like to talk now about soil

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.580 
here I would like to talk now about soil
mix<00:02:11.220> which<00:02:11.400> is<00:02:11.610> probably<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.720> most<00:02:12.900> important

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
mix which is probably the most important

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.729 
mix which is probably the most important
aspect<00:02:13.709> of<00:02:14.099> it<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:16.020> question<00:02:16.410> I<00:02:16.500> get<00:02:16.709> most

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
aspect of it and the question I get most

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.430 
aspect of it and the question I get most
is<00:02:17.400> what<00:02:17.670> do<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:17.760> plant<00:02:18.180> this<00:02:18.330> is<00:02:18.569> so<00:02:19.230> if<00:02:19.319> we're

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
is what do I plant this is so if we're

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.750 
is what do I plant this is so if we're
going<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.650> come<00:02:19.800> over<00:02:19.920> here<00:02:20.280> we're<00:02:20.489> going<00:02:20.640> to

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
going to come over here we're going to

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.580 
going to come over here we're going to
write<00:02:20.970> back<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.420> day<00:02:21.569> one<00:02:21.840> when<00:02:22.050> I<00:02:22.080> started

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
write back to day one when I started

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.990 
write back to day one when I started
with<00:02:22.739> this<00:02:22.890> program<00:02:23.450> and<00:02:25.099> started<00:02:26.099> the<00:02:26.730> seed

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
with this program and started the seed

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.059 
with this program and started the seed
varieties<00:02:27.510> that<00:02:27.690> I<00:02:27.720> had<00:02:27.930> selected<00:02:28.260> in<00:02:28.709> a<00:02:28.860> pot

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069

like this with Fox farms light warrior

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.790 
like this with Fox farms light warrior
seeds<00:02:34.290> started<00:02:34.860> and<00:02:35.239> probably<00:02:36.239> in<00:02:36.330> about<00:02:36.800> six

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
seeds started and probably in about six

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.119 
seeds started and probably in about six
seven<00:02:38.250> weeks<00:02:38.489> I<00:02:38.730> had<00:02:39.530> plants<00:02:40.530> that<00:02:40.739> were<00:02:40.890> about

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
seven weeks I had plants that were about

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.360 
seven weeks I had plants that were about
eight<00:02:41.790> ten<00:02:42.510> inches<00:02:42.840> tall<00:02:42.900> rooted<00:02:43.830> in<00:02:43.980> and

eight ten inches tall rooted in and

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.650 
eight ten inches tall rooted in and
ready<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.730> go<00:02:44.970> right<00:02:45.239> into<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.690> dirt<00:02:45.900> clod<00:02:47.660> now

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
ready to go right into the dirt clod now

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.100 
ready to go right into the dirt clod now
what<00:02:49.050> I<00:02:49.080> did<00:02:49.349> is<00:02:49.379> I<00:02:49.940> made<00:02:50.940> a<00:02:51.000> mixture<00:02:51.450> of<00:02:51.599> three

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
what I did is I made a mixture of three

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:58.850 
what I did is I made a mixture of three
parts<00:02:53.360> of<00:02:55.010> Fox<00:02:56.010> farm<00:02:57.110> ocean<00:02:58.110> force<00:02:58.379> potting

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
parts of Fox farm ocean force potting

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.470 
parts of Fox farm ocean force potting
soil<00:02:59.989> one<00:03:00.989> part<00:03:01.349> of<00:03:01.830> happy<00:03:02.250> frog<00:03:02.550> soil

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
soil one part of happy frog soil

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.350 
soil one part of happy frog soil
conditioner<00:03:04.140> so<00:03:04.650> actually<00:03:05.069> mixed<00:03:05.459> these<00:03:06.000> that

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
conditioner so actually mixed these that

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.500 
conditioner so actually mixed these that
raise<00:03:06.959> you<00:03:07.110> a<00:03:07.140> three<00:03:07.620> to<00:03:07.860> one<00:03:08.150> to<00:03:09.150> which<00:03:09.330> I

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
raise you a three to one to which I

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.259 
raise you a three to one to which I
added<00:03:09.810> a<00:03:10.319> little<00:03:10.830> bit<00:03:11.099> of<00:03:11.370> chickadee<00:03:11.909> booboo

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
added a little bit of chickadee booboo

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.580 
added a little bit of chickadee booboo
fertilizer<00:03:12.870> and<00:03:13.909> marine<00:03:14.909> queen<00:03:15.330> fruit<00:03:15.659> marine

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
fertilizer and marine queen fruit marine

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.740 
fertilizer and marine queen fruit marine
cuisine<00:03:17.040> fertilizer<00:03:17.580> I<00:03:17.909> use<00:03:18.269> both<00:03:18.480> them

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
cuisine fertilizer I use both them

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.330 
cuisine fertilizer I use both them
because<00:03:19.019> both<00:03:19.200> of<00:03:19.290> them<00:03:19.440> are<00:03:19.590> high<00:03:19.769> in<00:03:19.980> calcium

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
because both of them are high in calcium

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.970 
because both of them are high in calcium
and<00:03:20.819> I<00:03:21.209> kind<00:03:21.450> of<00:03:21.510> like<00:03:21.659> to<00:03:21.900> experiment<00:03:22.680> with

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
and I kind of like to experiment with

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.789 
and I kind of like to experiment with
mixing<00:03:23.400> them<00:03:23.489> a<00:03:23.519> little<00:03:23.760> bit<00:03:23.879> so<00:03:24.599> that's<00:03:25.530> what

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
mixing them a little bit so that's what

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.830 
mixing them a little bit so that's what
went<00:03:26.040> into<00:03:26.580> the<00:03:26.670> mix<00:03:26.909> now<00:03:28.099> after<00:03:29.099> that<00:03:29.840> they

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
went into the mix now after that they

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.010 
went into the mix now after that they
were<00:03:30.900> ready<00:03:31.200> to<00:03:31.290> go<00:03:31.530> right<00:03:31.799> into<00:03:32.069> the

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
were ready to go right into the

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.100 
were ready to go right into the
the<00:03:34.530> dirt<00:03:35.070> pot<00:03:35.280> so<00:03:35.730> what<00:03:35.850> happens<00:03:36.240> is<00:03:36.420> I<00:03:36.660> put

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
the dirt pot so what happens is I put

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.350 
the dirt pot so what happens is I put
about<00:03:37.230> a<00:03:37.380> third<00:03:37.740> of<00:03:37.890> the<00:03:37.950> mixture<00:03:38.370> into<00:03:38.820> the

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
about a third of the mixture into the

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.510 
about a third of the mixture into the
dirt<00:03:39.600> pot<00:03:39.840> and<00:03:40.410> I<00:03:40.590> would<00:03:40.800> take<00:03:40.980> and<00:03:41.250> I<00:03:41.340> would

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
dirt pot and I would take and I would

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.230 
dirt pot and I would take and I would
compact<00:03:42.270> it<00:03:42.510> down<00:03:42.870> and<00:03:43.230> out<00:03:43.920> I<00:03:44.370> wanted<00:03:45.030> to<00:03:45.090> keep

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
compact it down and out I wanted to keep

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.780 
compact it down and out I wanted to keep
pressure<00:03:45.570> on<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:46.050> perimeter<00:03:46.650> of<00:03:46.830> the<00:03:47.550> dirt

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
pressure on the perimeter of the dirt

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.580 
pressure on the perimeter of the dirt
pot<00:03:48.030> because<00:03:48.600> this<00:03:48.810> will<00:03:48.990> maintain<00:03:49.230> the

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
pot because this will maintain the

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.260 
pot because this will maintain the
structure<00:03:50.010> of<00:03:50.070> the<00:03:50.160> dirt<00:03:50.340> pot<00:03:50.610> and<00:03:50.850> it<00:03:51.030> looks

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
structure of the dirt pot and it looks

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.240 
structure of the dirt pot and it looks
like<00:03:51.540> these<00:03:52.140> doing<00:03:52.440> they're<00:03:52.590> quite

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
like these doing they're quite

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.580 
like these doing they're quite
cylindrical<00:03:53.880> in<00:03:53.940> nature<00:03:54.170> so<00:03:55.170> after<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:55.560> third

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
cylindrical in nature so after the third

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.130 
cylindrical in nature so after the third
went<00:03:56.070> in<00:03:56.250> I<00:03:56.370> put<00:03:56.550> another<00:03:56.790> third<00:03:57.180> in<00:03:57.420> compress

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
went in I put another third in compress

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.770 
went in I put another third in compress
that<00:03:58.380> down<00:03:58.440> pushed<00:03:59.250> it<00:03:59.430> to<00:03:59.550> the<00:03:59.670> outside<00:03:59.820> kept

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
that down pushed it to the outside kept

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.570 
that down pushed it to the outside kept
doing<00:04:00.990> that<00:04:01.110> until<00:04:01.350> I<00:04:01.410> got<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:01.770> pot<00:04:02.010> as<00:04:02.220> full

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
doing that until I got the pot as full

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.870 
doing that until I got the pot as full
as<00:04:02.730> possible<00:04:02.840> with<00:04:03.840> compacted<00:04:04.590> soil<00:04:04.950> once

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
as possible with compacted soil once

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
as possible with compacted soil once
that<00:04:06.090> was<00:04:06.300> done<00:04:07.730> it's<00:04:08.730> ready<00:04:09.030> to<00:04:09.300> go<00:04:09.480> ahead<00:04:09.540> and

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
that was done it's ready to go ahead and
