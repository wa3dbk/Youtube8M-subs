00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
through but this time I decided that I

camp<00:02:14.900> this<00:02:15.900> took<00:02:16.110> me<00:02:16.170> approximately<00:02:16.470> an<00:02:17.250> hour

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
camp this took me approximately an hour

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.260 
camp this took me approximately an hour
and<00:02:18.150> a<00:02:18.840> half<00:02:19.050> I<00:02:19.350> don't<00:02:19.680> even<00:02:19.950> know<00:02:20.100> but<00:02:20.280> if<00:02:20.700> you

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
and a half I don't even know but if you

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.930

have<00:02:21.420> long<00:02:21.660> long<00:02:22.560> hair<00:02:22.770> like<00:02:22.950> I<00:02:23.100> do<00:02:23.160> or<00:02:23.580> longer

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
I would not suggest the cap just because

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.940 
I would not suggest the cap just because
it's<00:02:26.910> kind<00:02:27.630> of<00:02:27.720> painful<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.530> you<00:02:28.620> can<00:02:28.770> just
