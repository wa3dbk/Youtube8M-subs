00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:09.470 
okay here goes well this is what I have
that<00:00:06.839> injector<00:00:07.350> pump<00:00:07.529> right<00:00:07.799> there<00:00:08.330> I'm<00:00:09.330> going

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
that injector pump right there I'm going

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.810 
that injector pump right there I'm going
to<00:00:09.570> we're<00:00:09.780> going<00:00:09.809> to<00:00:09.930> take<00:00:10.170> it<00:00:10.289> off<00:00:10.469> because

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:10.820 
to we're going to take it off because

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.529 
to we're going to take it off because
it's<00:00:11.820> leaking<00:00:12.420> out<00:00:12.570> of<00:00:12.600> the<00:00:13.129> overflow<00:00:14.129> pipe<00:00:14.730> on

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:15.539 
it's leaking out of the overflow pipe on

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:19.400 
it's leaking out of the overflow pipe on
the<00:00:16.020> ground<00:00:16.699> and<00:00:17.699> it's<00:00:17.880> also<00:00:18.410> leaking

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
the ground and it's also leaking

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.550 
the ground and it's also leaking
somewhere<00:00:20.179> into<00:00:21.179> the<00:00:21.300> crankcase<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:22.109> it's

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
somewhere into the crankcase and it's

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.200 
somewhere into the crankcase and it's
just<00:00:25.560> adding<00:00:25.919> to<00:00:26.039> my<00:00:26.070> fluid<00:00:26.609> in<00:00:26.669> the<00:00:26.789> crankcase

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
just adding to my fluid in the crankcase

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.519 
just adding to my fluid in the crankcase
which<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:27.449> don't<00:00:27.539> want<00:00:27.659> to<00:00:27.869> mix<00:00:28.050> that<00:00:28.230> diesel

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
which I don't want to mix that diesel

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.640 
which I don't want to mix that diesel
and<00:00:28.970> oil<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.240> am<00:00:30.390> saying<00:00:30.839> it's<00:00:30.960> gonna<00:00:31.079> kill<00:00:31.470> the

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
and oil I am saying it's gonna kill the

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.179 
and oil I am saying it's gonna kill the
engine

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
engine

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.040 
engine
so<00:00:32.640> before<00:00:32.910> there's<00:00:33.060> a<00:00:33.120> problem<00:00:33.150> I'm<00:00:33.900> gonna

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
so before there's a problem I'm gonna

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.840 
so before there's a problem I'm gonna
pull<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.440> off<00:00:34.500> it's<00:00:35.040> still<00:00:35.310> early<00:00:35.340> it's<00:00:35.760> only

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.340 
it out and get it rebuilt or change it
for<00:00:40.320> our<00:00:40.530> rebuilt<00:00:40.890> one<00:00:41.390> unit<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.540> put<00:00:43.080> it<00:00:43.230> back

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
for our rebuilt one unit and put it back

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.470 
for our rebuilt one unit and put it back
on<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:43.980> it's<00:00:44.370> kind<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.580> kind<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.940> document<00:00:45.390> what

goes<00:01:03.530> okay<00:01:04.530> what<00:01:04.680> I'm<00:01:04.799> going<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:04.979> do<00:01:05.100> because

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
goes okay what I'm going to do because

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.770 
goes okay what I'm going to do because
it's<00:01:05.489> gonna<00:01:05.609> be<00:01:05.729> real<00:01:05.880> difficult<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.509> hold<00:01:06.689> the

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
it's gonna be real difficult to hold the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.859 
it's gonna be real difficult to hold the
camera<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.700> work<00:01:08.700> at<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:08.969> same<00:01:09.119> time<00:01:09.420> I'm

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
camera and work at the same time I'm

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.560 
camera and work at the same time I'm
going<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.020> just<00:01:10.429> explain<00:01:11.429> real<00:01:11.729> quick<00:01:11.939> but<00:01:12.539> I

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
going to just explain real quick but I

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.239 
going to just explain real quick but I
guess<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:12.990> compression<00:01:14.270> release<00:01:15.320> lever<00:01:16.320> put

00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:17.249 
guess that compression release lever put

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:18.770 
guess that compression release lever put
it<00:01:17.340> towards<00:01:17.549> on<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.789> gas<00:01:17.969> side<00:01:18.299> which<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.630> is

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
it towards on the gas side which it is

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.230 
it towards on the gas side which it is
forward<00:01:20.179> it<00:01:21.179> looks<00:01:21.359> pretty<00:01:21.600> simple<00:01:23.060> we<00:01:24.060> move

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
forward it looks pretty simple we move

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.149 
forward it looks pretty simple we move
this<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:25.159> couple<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.219> fuel<00:01:26.429> lines<00:01:27.859> one<00:01:28.859> more<00:01:29.069> up

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
this a couple of fuel lines one more up

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.330 
this a couple of fuel lines one more up
here<00:01:29.399> at<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.579> injector<00:01:29.999> lines<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:31.009> the<00:01:32.009> front

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
here at the injector lines and the front

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.010 
here at the injector lines and the front
cover<00:01:32.639> plate<00:01:33.030> which<00:01:33.389> I<00:01:33.479> think<00:01:33.689> will<00:01:33.780> give<00:01:33.899> us

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
cover plate which I think will give us

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.899 
cover plate which I think will give us
access<00:01:34.289> to<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:35.700> bolts<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.179> hold<00:01:36.210> this<00:01:36.539> end<00:01:37.909> let

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
access to the bolts to hold this end let

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.399 
access to the bolts to hold this end let
me<00:01:39.030> take<00:01:39.179> it<00:01:39.270> apart<00:01:39.539> and<00:01:39.749> dog<00:01:39.899> we'll<00:01:40.170> be<00:01:40.259> right

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
me take it apart and dog we'll be right

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.669 
me take it apart and dog we'll be right
back<00:01:41.179> alright<00:01:42.179> well<00:01:42.539> this<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.170> what<00:01:43.319> I<00:01:43.350> did

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:43.679 
back alright well this is what I did

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:46.059 
back alright well this is what I did
everything<00:01:44.219> is<00:01:44.310> unhooked<00:01:44.639> injector<00:01:45.450> lines

00:01:46.059 --> 00:01:46.069

this<00:01:54.400> mechanism<00:01:54.700> I<00:01:55.420> took<00:01:56.080> up<00:01:56.170> the<00:01:56.290> front<00:01:56.470> cover

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
this mechanism I took up the front cover

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.760 
this mechanism I took up the front cover
for<00:01:57.040> the<00:01:57.100> timing<00:01:57.640> and<00:01:57.910> if<00:01:58.600> what<00:01:58.870> I'm<00:01:59.020> told

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
for the timing and if what I'm told

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.800 
for the timing and if what I'm told
as<00:01:59.860> long<00:02:00.070> as<00:02:00.190> you<00:02:00.280> don't<00:02:00.430> move<00:02:01.210> the<00:02:01.450> in<00:02:01.570> turn

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
as long as you don't move the in turn

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.890 
as long as you don't move the in turn
the<00:02:01.930> engine<00:02:02.140> over<00:02:02.260> once<00:02:03.130> this<00:02:03.610> is<00:02:03.790> a<00:02:03.820> part<00:02:04.180> you

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
the engine over once this is a part you

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
the engine over once this is a part you
just<00:02:05.050> kind<00:02:05.230> of<00:02:05.260> put<00:02:05.440> this<00:02:05.500> it<00:02:05.650> back<00:02:05.770> together

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
just kind of put this it back together

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.550 
just kind of put this it back together
with<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.430> same<00:02:07.000> timing<00:02:07.330> work<00:02:07.630> and<00:02:08.440> I'm

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
with the same timing work and I'm

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.020 
with the same timing work and I'm
looking<00:02:08.860> right<00:02:08.979> now<00:02:09.040> I'm<00:02:09.310> pretty<00:02:09.580> much<00:02:09.700> on

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
looking right now I'm pretty much on

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.900 
looking right now I'm pretty much on
zero<00:02:11.010> so<00:02:12.010> I'm<00:02:12.220> gonna<00:02:12.340> take<00:02:13.060> it<00:02:13.120> off<00:02:14.790> send<00:02:15.790> it

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
zero so I'm gonna take it off send it

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.990 
zero so I'm gonna take it off send it
all<00:02:16.030> get<00:02:16.330> rebuilt<00:02:16.660> or<00:02:17.160> buy<00:02:18.160> a<00:02:18.190> rebuilt<00:02:18.610> one<00:02:18.760> and

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
all get rebuilt or buy a rebuilt one and

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.330 
all get rebuilt or buy a rebuilt one and
put<00:02:19.240> it<00:02:19.270> back<00:02:19.420> on<00:02:19.600> so<00:02:19.900> let<00:02:20.500> me<00:02:20.590> pull<00:02:20.800> it<00:02:20.920> off<00:02:21.070> and

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
put it back on so let me pull it off and

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.330 
put it back on so let me pull it off and
LCL<00:02:21.880> goes<00:02:22.140> all<00:02:23.140> right<00:02:23.290> what<00:02:23.470> I<00:02:23.500> did<00:02:23.800> I<00:02:23.830> took<00:02:23.980> out

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
LCL goes all right what I did I took out

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.360 
LCL goes all right what I did I took out
I<00:02:24.670> loosened<00:02:25.240> actually<00:02:25.690> these<00:02:26.010> three<00:02:27.010> screws

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
I loosened actually these three screws

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.210 
I loosened actually these three screws
and<00:02:28.210> that<00:02:28.510> must<00:02:28.720> be<00:02:28.810> how<00:02:29.080> you<00:02:29.140> adjust<00:02:29.380> a<00:02:29.800> timing

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
and that must be how you adjust a timing

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.730 
and that must be how you adjust a timing
on<00:02:30.340> it<00:02:30.370> cuz<00:02:30.700> I<00:02:30.970> can't<00:02:31.810> get<00:02:31.990> some<00:02:32.230> movement<00:02:32.410> on

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
on it cuz I can't get some movement on

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.640 
on it cuz I can't get some movement on
this<00:02:33.240> so<00:02:34.240> like<00:02:34.390> I<00:02:34.420> say<00:02:34.630> now<00:02:35.080> what<00:02:35.320> I'm<00:02:35.440> told

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
this so like I say now what I'm told

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.250 
this so like I say now what I'm told
that<00:02:35.980> pump<00:02:36.670> only<00:02:36.910> goes<00:02:37.060> on<00:02:37.210> one<00:02:37.270> way<00:02:37.720> so<00:02:38.230> I

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
that pump only goes on one way so I

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.140 
that pump only goes on one way so I
think<00:02:38.470> you<00:02:38.530> what<00:02:39.160> I'm<00:02:39.250> assuming<00:02:39.520> is<00:02:39.790> he<00:02:39.940> but

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
think you what I'm assuming is he but

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.900 
think you what I'm assuming is he but
get<00:02:40.270> the<00:02:40.360> pump<00:02:40.570> back<00:02:40.780> on<00:02:41.050> and<00:02:41.410> then<00:02:42.100> you<00:02:42.250> adjust

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
get the pump back on and then you adjust

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.490 
get the pump back on and then you adjust
your<00:02:42.970> time<00:02:43.270> and<00:02:43.540> tighten<00:02:44.140> these<00:02:44.230> down

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
your time and tighten these down

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.000 
your time and tighten these down
I<00:02:44.800> just<00:02:45.700> I<00:02:45.820> me<00:02:46.330> to<00:02:46.450> worry<00:02:46.630> it<00:02:46.960> was<00:02:47.260> which<00:02:47.740> is<00:02:47.860> on

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
I just I me to worry it was which is on

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.850 
I just I me to worry it was which is on
zero<00:02:49.050> happened<00:02:50.050> down<00:02:50.170> you<00:02:50.320> should<00:02:50.470> be<00:02:50.560> good<00:02:50.740> to

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
zero happened down you should be good to

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:51.000 
zero happened down you should be good to
go

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
go

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.120 
go
so<00:02:51.400> let<00:02:51.670> me<00:02:51.730> keep<00:02:51.850> going<00:02:52.230> well<00:02:53.230> alright<00:02:53.590> well<00:02:53.620> I

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
so let me keep going well alright well I

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.840 
so let me keep going well alright well I
got<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.240> pump<00:02:55.480> off<00:02:55.690> a<00:02:56.130> little<00:02:57.130> tough<00:02:57.400> comfort

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
got the pump off a little tough comfort

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.580 
got the pump off a little tough comfort
of<00:02:57.940> tougher<00:02:58.239> than<00:02:58.360> then<00:02:58.870> I<00:02:58.989> thought<00:02:59.380> it<00:02:59.500> was

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
of tougher than then I thought it was

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:08.640 
of tougher than then I thought it was
gonna<00:02:59.770> be<00:03:00.840> all<00:03:01.840> this<00:03:03.030> dirt<00:03:04.030> junk<00:03:07.260> twigs<00:03:08.260> looks

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
gonna be all this dirt junk twigs looks

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.570 
gonna be all this dirt junk twigs looks
like<00:03:09.270> pine<00:03:10.270> needles<00:03:10.950> I'm<00:03:11.950> sorry<00:03:12.190> there<00:03:12.340> you<00:03:12.430> go

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
like pine needles I'm sorry there you go

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.340 
like pine needles I'm sorry there you go
pine<00:03:12.880> needles<00:03:13.239> from<00:03:13.360> behind<00:03:13.720> the<00:03:13.840> pump

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
pine needles from behind the pump

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.740 
pine needles from behind the pump
I<00:03:14.380> imagined<00:03:15.340> it's<00:03:15.520> fire<00:03:15.790> safe<00:03:16.060> but<00:03:16.239> this<00:03:16.510> pump

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
I imagined it's fire safe but this pump

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.080 
I imagined it's fire safe but this pump
has<00:03:16.810> never<00:03:17.020> been<00:03:17.170> off<00:03:17.380> in<00:03:17.560> his<00:03:17.650> life<00:03:17.970> so<00:03:18.970> it's

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
has never been off in his life so it's

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.729 
has never been off in his life so it's
probably<00:03:19.360> a<00:03:19.450> good<00:03:19.570> idea<00:03:19.690> that<00:03:20.110> I<00:03:20.140> am<00:03:20.230> taking<00:03:20.709> it

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
probably a good idea that I am taking it

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.850 
probably a good idea that I am taking it
off<00:03:20.950> to<00:03:21.100> get<00:03:21.220> it<00:03:21.370> rebuilt<00:03:22.470> like<00:03:23.470> I<00:03:23.590> said<00:03:23.770> this

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
off to get it rebuilt like I said this

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.240 
off to get it rebuilt like I said this
is<00:03:24.070> the<00:03:24.100> there<00:03:25.030> it<00:03:25.150> is<00:03:25.239> there's<00:03:25.540> the<00:03:25.690> monster

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
is the there it is there's the monster

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.520 
is the there it is there's the monster
so<00:03:27.250> I<00:03:27.280> will<00:03:27.670> make<00:03:28.600> some<00:03:28.959> phone<00:03:29.110> calls

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
so I will make some phone calls

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.930 
so I will make some phone calls
I<00:03:29.970> got<00:03:30.970> a<00:03:31.000> couple<00:03:31.239> guys<00:03:31.950> possible<00:03:32.950> who<00:03:33.760> are

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
I got a couple guys possible who are

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.590 
I got a couple guys possible who are
gonna<00:03:34.239> either<00:03:34.630> rebuild<00:03:35.170> it<00:03:35.350> or<00:03:36.480> send<00:03:37.480> me<00:03:37.570> a

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
gonna either rebuild it or send me a

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.500 
gonna either rebuild it or send me a
rebuilt<00:03:38.020> pump<00:03:38.260> like<00:03:39.250> it's<00:03:39.400> a<00:03:39.489> good<00:03:39.790> bigger

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
rebuilt pump like it's a good bigger

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.690 
rebuilt pump like it's a good bigger
problem<00:03:40.930> was<00:03:41.020> all<00:03:41.260> going<00:03:41.530> at<00:03:41.739> the<00:03:41.860> easel<00:03:42.459> going

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
problem was all going at the easel going

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.820 
problem was all going at the easel going
into<00:03:42.880> the<00:03:43.000> crank<00:03:43.239> case<00:03:43.350> which<00:03:44.350> I'm<00:03:44.470> sure<00:03:44.709> is

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
into the crank case which I'm sure is

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.350 
into the crank case which I'm sure is
going<00:03:45.070> through<00:03:45.310> here<00:03:46.090> somehow<00:03:46.570> a<00:03:48.180> long<00:03:49.180> way

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
going through here somehow a long way

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.250 
going through here somehow a long way
can<00:03:49.540> go<00:03:49.720> and<00:03:50.050> the<00:03:50.560> number<00:03:50.830> two<00:03:51.040> problem<00:03:51.790> was

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
can go and the number two problem was

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.949 
can go and the number two problem was
that<00:03:53.260> there's<00:03:53.560> a<00:03:54.390> line<00:03:55.390> that<00:03:55.420> comes<00:03:55.690> up<00:03:55.840> the

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
that there's a line that comes up the

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.910 
that there's a line that comes up the
bottom<00:03:56.640> here<00:03:57.640> like<00:03:58.239> an<00:03:58.390> overflow<00:03:58.870> is<00:03:59.440> leaking

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
bottom here like an overflow is leaking

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.910 
bottom here like an overflow is leaking
out<00:03:59.980> of<00:04:00.130> there<00:04:00.250> onto<00:04:00.459> the<00:04:00.580> ground<00:04:00.820> also<00:04:01.180> so

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
out of there onto the ground also so

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.900 
out of there onto the ground also so
hopefully<00:04:02.920> this<00:04:03.040> will<00:04:03.160> solve<00:04:03.400> the<00:04:03.490> problem

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
hopefully this will solve the problem

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.640 
hopefully this will solve the problem
and<00:04:04.210> maybe<00:04:04.810> you<00:04:04.930> can<00:04:05.080> make<00:04:05.200> the<00:04:05.320> thing<00:04:05.350> run

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
and maybe you can make the thing run

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.320 
and maybe you can make the thing run
better<00:04:05.890> which<00:04:06.250> might

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
better which might

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.900 
better which might
because<00:04:07.780> the<00:04:07.900> thing<00:04:08.050> ran<00:04:08.230> ran<00:04:08.710> perfect<00:04:09.190> except

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
because the thing ran ran perfect except

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.580 
because the thing ran ran perfect except
for<00:04:10.060> the<00:04:10.120> leaks<00:04:10.360> like<00:04:10.750> you<00:04:10.870> say<00:04:11.050> it's<00:04:11.440> probably

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
for the leaks like you say it's probably

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:12.990 
for the leaks like you say it's probably
never<00:04:11.830> been<00:04:12.010> off<00:04:12.160> the<00:04:12.190> tractor<00:04:12.520> in<00:04:12.730> its<00:04:12.850> life

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
never been off the tractor in its life

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.420 
never been off the tractor in its life
so<00:04:13.210> it's<00:04:13.330> probably<00:04:13.600> due<00:04:13.750> for<00:04:13.990> a<00:04:14.410> quick<00:04:15.250> going

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
so it's probably due for a quick going

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.560 
so it's probably due for a quick going
over<00:04:16.110> so<00:04:17.110> I'll<00:04:17.560> forget<00:04:17.950> this<00:04:18.239> into<00:04:19.239> a<00:04:19.269> box

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
over so I'll forget this into a box

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.980 
over so I'll forget this into a box
