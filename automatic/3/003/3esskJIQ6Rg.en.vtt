00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.190
 hello welcome on how 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:13.660
 photography.com today I'm going 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:14.980
 to talk to you about a delicate domain 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.969
 to know what do I have to do by 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.560
 relation to a photo is what it is 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.650
 preferable to underexposed or 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.019
 overexposed then a lot tell you 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.970
 that it is better to have an image 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:26.400
 slightly overexposed as the histogram 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.900
 be right 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.269
 you know about the histogram already done 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.579
 a video on it on the site how 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.840
 photograph.com on the histogram 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.969
 how does it work so a 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.309
 histogram is all that is to 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:41.140
 right will concern the highlights 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.410
 and everything on the left is going to concern 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.359
 the low lights and then as soon as that 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.129
 goes up it's going to be more done to give 

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:50.440
 plus the number of pixels 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:53.230
 then there are more be pixels in one 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.640
 hue given in the in the blacks you 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.710
 will have a very high curve 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.750
 if you have very few pixels in the 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.920
 blacks you have a very low curve and 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.149
 on the contrary if you have a lot of 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.579
 pixels in the whites are worth a yard 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:05.710
 who is going to be very very hot and if there is 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.820
 very little it will be very low so that's it 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.880
 roughly speaking in the big cities in 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.259
 operation of the histogram and therefore 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.330
 a lot tell you it is better 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:14.590
 to have a histogram rather right 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.360
 on the left 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.189
 I would say yes and no I'm not 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.290
 totally agree because on a 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:20.970
 photo a jpeg format not on the format 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.610
 jpeg 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.299
 because on the euro it's like stinks 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.740
 greater value 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:30.820
 I jpeg format when overexposed 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.960
 when we are white, it means that 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.939
 is nothing anymore there is more 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.250
 information is empty whereas at 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.470
 reverse if we are dark if we are under 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.020
 exposed there is always information 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:44.799
 there are too many but we can arrive 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.600
 to recover something when there is 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.909
 too much information can be retrieved from 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.570
 information when there is more 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:55.860
 can not recover anything so be careful 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.659
 some will promote overexposure 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.969
 why because they will be interested 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.219
 at low lights to not be 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:06.009
 in total darkness 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.479
 is it like me or in my job I 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.149
 do a lot of buildings a lot of 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.250
 landscapes it happens to me too 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.220
 I will promote the under-exposure 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.430
 why because for me the skies 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.659
 are important i'm going to work in 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.610
 raw so I'll be able to fetch 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:24.900
 of low and highlights 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.519
 but when you do jpeg of Jreige 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.750
 to be able to go for more information in 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.109
 the low lights only in the high 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.090
 lights 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:33.299
 so I will favor systematically 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:37.769
 the underexposure so here I am in you 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:40.579
 do the little demo I'm at the sea ​​I 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:43.200
 do my picture hop 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:46.079
 so here I am under the ex normally 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.500
 naturally open my 400th diaphragm 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.500
 at 8 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:57.900
 here I have my normal picture so I have the 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.389
 sun opposite the three-quarter on the 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.950
 left 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:04.489
 so this is a photo I would say to little 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.439
 I will bring the histogram 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:10.769
 I'm slightly overexposed so I 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:14.180
 will do again but global fragments on 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.180
 will get to four hundredths with 10 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:21.090
 that's better so now I 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:28.139
 will overexpose a diaphragm 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:31.849
 so I'm going from three notches to 7.1 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:34.849
 so I'm overexposed a diaphragm 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.849
 here 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.750
 and I'm going to underexposed a diaphragm 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.959
 here 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.069
 and see now in post treatment 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.819
 for me it will be easier with the 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:56.510
 photo under the ex to return to the results 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:59.150
 of the normal photo and conversely with 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.579
 the overexposed photo of a diaf I do not 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:05.299
 fail to return to the same result 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:08.150
 the sun is definitely burning and 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:10.299
 I can not recover that so 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.370
 be careful you have and not a rule 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:16.459
 definite I do not say but better 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.560
 you expose that overexposed giresse and 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.880
 in most cases it is not 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.479
 not it is often better to 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.800
 underexposed it is better to have 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:26.479
 to overexpose 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.430
 underexposure to the 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:31.009
 overexposure but it adapted in 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.050
 according to your needs 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:35.889
 do not forget that if you ever want 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.570
 favor the overexposed low lights 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:41.479
 ok good generally made 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.680
 trust your device it is it is 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:43.400
 made to give you a good 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.470
 exposure 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.870
 but sometimes we need 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.909
 the exposure correction tool and 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.080
 change things so that's why 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:54.620
 that I am often brought to 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.510
 underexposed more than overexposed lo 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.190
 for that so do not hesitate to make us 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.340
 share your experiences in the 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:03.669
 domain because if you ever have 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.780
 you more overexposure needs 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.070
 use the comments made us 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.419
 share your experience because in 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.030
 same time it's important to know 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:12.440
 your opinion is to know in which cases 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.409
 you have special needs 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.430
 so that's the goal of the site how 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:18.139
 to photograph points like it's to be 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.530
 very open and that everyone can 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:22.460
 give that talk about his experiences and 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.009
 share with everyone 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.409
 I wonder that we do that 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:29.880
 everyone can move forward together 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:31.230
