 also looks after the asim watch that 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.260
 crossroads proposes and as I had 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.970
 not had the opportunity to take it in hand 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.980
 I do not think it's uninteresting 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.290
 several products there under the eyes so 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.180

 functional this one either it's there 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.510
 that there is a front camera on it and 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.980
 you know there are some brands that 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.630
 offer really great products 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.610
 basic there is an imac man here who 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.079
 want to make products that they 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.420

 national fatiha there are two models that 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:04.670
 have about the same properties 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:08.030

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.610

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:33.970
 obvious and you have a microsd port 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:37.659
 up to 16 gig microsd yeah 16 gigabyte 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:40.540

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.350
 etc and make calls 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.050
 it's really a watch that will you 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.310
 see there you can take 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.720
 you can take calls I know 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.920
 not how it works for now 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.979
 have buttons on the sides but I have 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.750
 not use them but here it is 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.759
 watch that does a little bit of everything that does 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.820
 whose office serves as the 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:03.550
 phone tea this is really the 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:07.769
 purpose here on this smartwatch we have one 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.910
 high next is the music player 

00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:11.970
 well, it was just for you 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:17.470
 give a reminder a quick overview of these 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.580
 ccim watch sw 0,1 and sw 0,2 we will have 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.420
 the opportunity I hope to test them 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.980
 since they are on sale at 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.310
 crossroads so that can be interesting 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.630
 you also have the dea bracelets 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.370
 which are proposed I think they are 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.590
 compatible with the with the watch and 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.390
 it's not exactly the same 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.799
 product but it must be 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.690
 compatible you can change see the 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:37.750
 ja and bracelets that looks like that 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.980
 the water appendages like that that's it 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.209
 should everything is what I like about 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.010
 done in cs and we realize 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.930
 really trends on bracelets 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.100
 the smart watch we have products that 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.480
 are very complete which allow to 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.370
 do a lot of things or even surely 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.829
 too much for my taste and there are some who are 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.269
 a lot more that is going small to 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.380
 small and who make products that are 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.390
 much easier to use 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.440
 in fact it will depend on your eyes 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.640
 your desires and your needs 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.640
 see you soon
