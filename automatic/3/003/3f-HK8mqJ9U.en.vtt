before
awesome<00:02:34.000> and<00:02:35.340> if<00:02:36.340> i<00:02:36.670> zoom<00:02:36.700> into<00:02:37.269> a<00:02:37.450> picture<00:02:38.250> now

right<00:02:41.379> here<00:02:41.590> I<00:02:41.799> think<00:02:42.370> it's<00:02:42.609> up<00:02:42.760> like<00:02:42.909> that

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
right here I think it's up like that

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.160 
right here I think it's up like that
that's<00:02:43.359> kind<00:02:43.659> of<00:02:43.690> cool

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
that's kind of cool

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.580 
that's kind of cool
I<00:02:44.200> also<00:02:45.030> because<00:02:46.030> of<00:02:46.150> this<00:02:46.329> I<00:02:46.690> can<00:02:47.290> look<00:02:47.409> at

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
I also because of this I can look at

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.569 
I also because of this I can look at
grid<00:02:47.970> just<00:02:48.970> nice<00:02:49.739> but<00:02:50.739> I<00:02:50.950> didn't<00:02:51.280> have<00:02:51.430> the

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
grid just nice but I didn't have the

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:57.119

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:57.129 
option of in show of pixel grid so that

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.789
