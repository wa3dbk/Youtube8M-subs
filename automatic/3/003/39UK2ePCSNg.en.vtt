 dandruff video I have a homemade mercury 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:20.130
 to end the dandruff once 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.410

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.390

 miss a single video and that's what 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.360
 we need to do is have jorgito 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.510
 home to end with dandruff 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.850
 Much attention is a shampoo shampoo 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.790
 regular that you use of all life the 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.760
 shampoo that you always use and also 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.380
 we need sodium bicarbonate this 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.480
 same as you are in any 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.090
 store the one we use for the bad 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.400
 smells that we use to exfoliate 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.040
 us the skin to whiten teeth 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.780
 this is not myth ok is the one that we are going to 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.150
 use and well cheap in iraq and this I 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.760
 it cost 99 cents or a dollar 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.150
 it works for me even for what you do not 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.280
 you imagine there are two ways to do this 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.880
 treatment for dandruff use the 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.220
 carbonate or bicarbonate alone 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:26.310
 you rinse your hair you deserve it with water 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.620
 of the key either cold or warm and takes 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.630
 a little dust and you put it on everything 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.420
 the scalp there you let rest 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.550
 up to an hour and then you wash your 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.290
 hair as usual with shampoo and 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.330
 the whole wave this you can do all 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.550
 day or whenever you want you 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.979
 because if it's half complicated do not get wet 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.560
 Then put the powder and wait for a 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.869
 hour and then bathe them like that 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.140
 It is very convenient but it is effective 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.690
 another option and that I love is the 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.760
 use the usual shampoo that with the 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.240
 that you wash your hair all the time and 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:03.420
 put baking soda on it but when 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.610
 good was a regular bottle as well as 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.789
 this size you are going to put two 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.670
 tablespoons of baking soda are 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.880
 you're going to put all the shampoo and we're going to 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.790
 stir and stir and stir until 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.709
 mix the bicarbonate with the shampoo and 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.650
 ready this shampoo you will use 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:25.170
 every day as usual and you're going to 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.510
 see that after two or three weeks the 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.180
 scalp begins to produce those 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.940
 natural oils that dandruff is going to 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.519
 go see little by little little by little and you 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.860
 you will love it and you will see it later 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:41.459
