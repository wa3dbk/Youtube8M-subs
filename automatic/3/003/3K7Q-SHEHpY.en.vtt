00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.960 
yeah I mean the game seems to be pretty

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.200 
yeah I mean the game seems to be pretty
balanced<00:04:02.560> out<00:04:02.740> even<00:04:03.400> though<00:04:03.490> you<00:04:03.550> dialogue

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.210 
balanced out even though you dialogue

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.900 
balanced out even though you dialogue
quickly<00:04:04.770> it<00:04:05.770> seems<00:04:06.010> like<00:04:06.220> it<00:04:06.400> barely<00:04:06.670> takes

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
quickly it seems like it barely takes

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.580 
quickly it seems like it barely takes
any<00:04:07.090> bullets<00:04:07.360> to<00:04:07.480> kill<00:04:07.510> a<00:04:07.720> person<00:04:07.900> you<00:04:08.320> know

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
any bullets to kill a person you know

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.710 
any bullets to kill a person you know
your<00:04:08.860> screen<00:04:09.190> it<00:04:09.340> does<00:04:09.820> take<00:04:10.480> a<00:04:10.510> lot<00:04:10.660> of

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
your screen it does take a lot of

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.640 
your screen it does take a lot of
bullets<00:04:11.080> and<00:04:11.260> on<00:04:11.620> the<00:04:12.520> other<00:04:12.910> screen<00:04:13.650> when

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
bullets and on the other screen when

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.490 
bullets and on the other screen when
you're<00:04:14.770> getting<00:04:14.890> killed<00:04:15.720> it<00:04:16.720> doesn't<00:04:17.230> but

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
you're getting killed it doesn't but

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.990 
you're getting killed it doesn't but
that's<00:04:17.739> only<00:04:17.950> with<00:04:18.160> the<00:04:18.280> neck<00:04:18.489> coding<00:04:18.850> because

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
that's only with the neck coding because

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.610 
that's only with the neck coding because
the<00:04:19.239> net<00:04:19.419> coding<00:04:19.810> I<00:04:19.900> hear<00:04:20.109> it's<00:04:20.200> pretty<00:04:20.260> bad

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
the net coding I hear it's pretty bad

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.909 
the net coding I hear it's pretty bad
but<00:04:21.220> um<00:04:21.660> that's<00:04:22.660> almost<00:04:22.990> a<00:04:23.169> one<00:04:23.410> thing<00:04:23.740> that

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
but um that's almost a one thing that

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:24.960 
but um that's almost a one thing that
could<00:04:24.070> be<00:04:24.190> fixed

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
could be fixed

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.970 
could be fixed
and<00:04:25.210> honestly<00:04:25.750> the<00:04:25.930> only<00:04:25.960> thing<00:04:26.470> that<00:04:26.830> could

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
and honestly the only thing that could

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.570 
and honestly the only thing that could
worsen<00:04:27.250> the<00:04:27.430> game<00:04:27.700> for<00:04:28.030> call<00:04:28.210> duty<00:04:28.390> is<00:04:28.720> if

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
worsen the game for call duty is if

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.710 
worsen the game for call duty is if
