00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
one but yeah I mean this is what my

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.459 
one but yeah I mean this is what my
build<00:02:06.180> is<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:06.360> haven't<00:02:06.780> had<00:02:06.930> any<00:02:07.110> issue<00:02:07.259> with

build is I haven't had any issue with

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.430 
build is I haven't had any issue with
the<00:02:07.979> skill<00:02:08.250> I'm<00:02:08.399> using<00:02:08.640> right<00:02:09.000> now<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:09.440> Android

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
the skill I'm using right now is Android

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.430 
the skill I'm using right now is Android
18s<00:02:11.069> or<00:02:11.550> androids<00:02:12.060> 17s<00:02:12.930> or<00:02:13.020> I<00:02:13.080> think<00:02:13.140> they<00:02:13.319> both

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
18s or androids 17s or I think they both

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.050 
18s or androids 17s or I think they both
use<00:02:13.650> it

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
use it

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.290 
use it
it's<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:15.260> super<00:02:15.800> electric<00:02:16.220> strike<00:02:16.490> I<00:02:16.760> think

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
it's the super electric strike I think

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.900 
it's the super electric strike I think
that's<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:17.569> best<00:02:17.780> a<00:02:17.930> AoE<00:02:18.740> damage<00:02:19.069> that<00:02:19.670> there

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
that's the best a AoE damage that there

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.960 
that's the best a AoE damage that there
is<00:02:20.800> that<00:02:21.800> you<00:02:21.920> can<00:02:22.069> use<00:02:22.220> because<00:02:22.430> for<00:02:22.880> example

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
is that you can use because for example

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.790 
is that you can use because for example
if<00:02:23.330> you're<00:02:23.510> fighting<00:02:23.870> two<00:02:24.290> or<00:02:24.380> three<00:02:24.560> people

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
if you're fighting two or three people

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.770 
if you're fighting two or three people
at<00:02:24.920> a<00:02:24.950> time<00:02:25.220> just<00:02:25.400> keep<00:02:25.880> spamming<00:02:26.150> that<00:02:26.480> skill

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
at a time just keep spamming that skill

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.240
