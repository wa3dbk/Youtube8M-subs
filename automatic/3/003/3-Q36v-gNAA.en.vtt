00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.910 
because I am making a shake for myself
and<00:00:47.940> for<00:00:47.970> Nadine<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.170> this<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.500> going<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.710> be

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
and for Nadine so this is going to be

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.620 
and for Nadine so this is going to be
the<00:00:50.520> amount<00:00:50.850> for<00:00:51.180> two<00:00:51.390> people<00:00:51.980> so<00:00:53.540> we're<00:00:54.540> going

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:54.630 
the amount for two people so we're going

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.260 
the amount for two people so we're going
to<00:00:54.719> have<00:00:54.840> two<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.980> these<00:00:56.160> are<00:00:56.340> small<00:00:56.550> bananas

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
to have two and these are small bananas

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.720 
to have two and these are small bananas
so<00:00:57.480> it's<00:00:57.660> actually<00:00:57.930> fine<00:00:58.469> if<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:59.250> have<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.460> much

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
so it's actually fine if you have a much

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.420 
so it's actually fine if you have a much
larger<00:01:00.120> banana<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.140> you're<00:01:01.590> making<00:01:01.800> two

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
larger banana and you're making two

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.139 
larger banana and you're making two
servings<00:01:03.030> maybe<00:01:03.420> you'll<00:01:03.799> just<00:01:04.799> freeze<00:01:05.489> the

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:06.149 
servings maybe you'll just freeze the

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:11.629 
servings maybe you'll just freeze the
other<00:01:06.359> half<00:01:06.659> for<00:01:06.689> later<00:01:07.170> or<00:01:07.319> for<00:01:07.889> tomorrow<00:01:10.639> ok

00:01:11.629 --> 00:01:11.639

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
the starchiness of it is reduced and

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.699 
the starchiness of it is reduced and
it's<00:01:21.270> purely<00:01:21.779> purely<00:01:22.529> a<00:01:24.200> natural<00:01:25.200> source<00:01:25.529> of

whole idea is for it to sustain you like

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.530 
whole idea is for it to sustain you like
a<00:04:53.250> solid<00:04:53.820> meal<00:04:54.090> wood<00:04:55.070> okay<00:04:56.070> now<00:04:56.910> we're<00:04:57.330> going

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
a solid meal wood okay now we're going

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:05.690 
a solid meal wood okay now we're going
to<00:04:57.810> add<00:04:58.080> our<00:05:01.640> gelatin<00:05:02.640> powder<00:05:04.400> which<00:05:05.400> is<00:05:05.430> our

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
to add our gelatin powder which is our

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
to add our gelatin powder which is our
protein<00:05:06.830> and<00:05:07.830> I'm<00:05:08.700> going<00:05:08.910> to<00:05:08.940> add<00:05:09.120> two

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720

protein and I'm going to add two
tablespoons<00:05:10.580> per<00:05:11.580> serving<00:05:12.120> so<00:05:12.770> I'm<00:05:13.770> going<00:05:13.920> to

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:13.980 
tablespoons per serving so I'm going to

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:19.310 
tablespoons per serving so I'm going to
put<00:05:14.130> in<00:05:14.220> four<00:05:14.460> tablespoons<00:05:17.840> now<00:05:18.840> you<00:05:18.900> see<00:05:19.290> that

put in four tablespoons now you see that

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.850 
put in four tablespoons now you see that
this<00:05:20.210> blender<00:05:21.210> is<00:05:21.240> definitely<00:05:22.200> filled<00:05:22.590> to<00:05:22.830> the

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860
