00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:41.300 

I<00:06:39.320> think<00:06:40.320> how<00:06:40.380> the<00:06:40.440> game<00:06:40.830> tells<00:06:41.070> in<00:06:41.160> there's

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:41.310 
I think how the game tells in there's

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:43.220 
I think how the game tells in there's
expressly<00:06:41.550> shooting<00:06:42.450> areas<00:06:42.720> not<00:06:42.930> shooting

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:43.230 
expressly shooting areas not shooting

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:47.000 
expressly shooting areas not shooting

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:49.320 
get a that's fancy looking I should

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.710 
get a that's fancy looking I should
certainly<00:06:49.500> get<00:06:49.740> a<00:06:50.210> saving<00:06:51.210> screen<00:06:51.510> here<00:06:51.690> so
