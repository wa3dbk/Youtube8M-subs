important feature and almost every
single<00:00:25.630> blender<00:00:26.380> animation<00:00:27.010> that<00:00:27.130> you'll

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.250 
single blender animation that you'll

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.470 
single blender animation that you'll
never<00:00:27.340> find<00:00:28.590> involves<00:00:29.590> I<00:00:29.800> pie<00:00:30.279> that's<00:00:31.180> all<00:00:31.330> of

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
never find involves I pie that's all of

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.600 
never find involves I pie that's all of
them<00:00:32.040> so<00:00:33.120> yeah<00:00:34.120> a<00:00:34.420> very<00:00:35.200> important<00:00:35.620> talk<00:00:35.829> so<00:00:36.370> I

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.050 
them so yeah a very important talk so I
pose<00:00:36.910> simply<00:00:37.810> keyframes<00:00:38.650> for<00:00:39.030> example<00:00:40.030> you

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:40.060 
pose simply keyframes for example you

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.000 
pose simply keyframes for example you
can<00:00:40.390> set<00:00:40.570> it<00:00:40.630> to<00:00:40.750> material<00:00:41.410> so<00:00:41.590> if<00:00:41.650> I<00:00:41.800> add<00:00:41.829> a

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
can set it to material so if I add a

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.940 
can set it to material so if I add a
material<00:00:42.550> to<00:00:42.700> notice<00:00:43.329> what<00:00:43.510> you<00:00:43.600> got<00:00:43.780> one<00:00:43.950> but

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950 
material to notice what you got one but

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.290 
material to notice what you got one but
let's<00:00:45.220> say<00:00:45.340> I<00:00:45.370> want<00:00:45.520> to<00:00:45.580> change<00:00:45.760> the<00:00:45.910> intensity

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
let's say I want to change the intensity

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.750 
let's say I want to change the intensity
so<00:00:46.630> from<00:00:46.810> here<00:00:46.990> I<00:00:47.230> right<00:00:47.680> click<00:00:47.710> press<00:00:48.400> insert

so from here I right click press insert

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.050 
so from here I right click press insert
keyframe<00:00:49.470> somewhere<00:00:50.470> over<00:00:50.710> here<00:00:50.910> track<00:00:51.910> it

going<00:00:57.160> to<00:00:57.250> say<00:00:57.430> that<00:00:58.180> I<00:00:58.360> just<00:00:58.660> go<00:00:58.840> frame<00:00:59.140> by

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
going to say that I just go frame by

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.760 
going to say that I just go frame by
frame<00:00:59.400> you're<00:01:00.400> going<00:01:00.580> to<00:01:00.670> see<00:01:00.790> the<00:01:00.910> value

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
frame you're going to see the value

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.390 
frame you're going to see the value
decrease<00:01:03.000> in<00:01:04.000> this<00:01:04.239> little<00:01:04.570> la<00:01:05.100> box<00:01:06.100> there

decrease in this little la box there
that's<00:01:07.030> just<00:01:07.210> some<00:01:07.420> simple<00:01:07.630> i<00:01:07.990> po<00:01:08.259> but<00:01:08.590> the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
that's just some simple i po but the

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.010 
that's just some simple i po but the
main<00:01:08.860> i<00:01:08.979> po<00:01:09.250> that<00:01:09.670> you<00:01:10.240> know<00:01:10.330> most<00:01:10.659> people

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
main i po that you know most people

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.090 
main i po that you know most people
refer<00:01:11.140> to<00:01:11.320> as<00:01:11.470> i<00:01:11.680> po<00:01:11.890> is<00:01:12.100> movement<00:01:12.790> probably<00:01:14.100> so

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
refer to as i po is movement probably so

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.510 
refer to as i po is movement probably so
let's<00:01:15.250> get<00:01:15.340> started<00:01:15.490> so<00:01:16.060> let's<00:01:16.330> say<00:01:16.600> I<00:01:16.869> want<00:01:17.200> to

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
you know make this cube go up and do a

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.760 
you know make this cube go up and do a
little<00:01:21.460> twirl<00:01:21.759> as<00:01:21.969> it<00:01:22.060> does<00:01:22.210> that<00:01:22.649> that<00:01:23.649> can

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
little twirl as it does that that can

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.370 
little twirl as it does that that can
all<00:01:23.890> be<00:01:23.920> done<00:01:24.009> very<00:01:24.880> simply<00:01:25.390> using<00:01:26.049> simple

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
all be done very simply using simple

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.590 
all be done very simply using simple
commands<00:01:26.679> in<00:01:26.859> the<00:01:26.890> i<00:01:27.130> po<00:01:29.130> settings<00:01:30.130> i<00:01:30.549> guess

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
commands in the i po settings i guess

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.359 
commands in the i po settings i guess

go<00:02:17.709> to<00:02:17.800> frame<00:02:18.160> 20<00:02:19.150> that's<00:02:20.020> what<00:02:20.140> it's<00:02:20.260> going<00:02:20.350> to

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
go to frame 20 that's what it's going to

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.429 
go to frame 20 that's what it's going to
start<00:02:20.620> I'm<00:02:21.069> going<00:02:21.189> to<00:02:21.250> press<00:02:21.459> I<00:02:22.439> location

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:23.439 
start I'm going to press I location

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:25.260 
start I'm going to press I location
rotation<00:02:24.159> mean<00:02:24.610> it's<00:02:24.790> going<00:02:24.909> to<00:02:25.000> change

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
rotation mean it's going to change

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.970 
rotation mean it's going to change
location<00:02:25.720> and<00:02:25.840> rotation<00:02:26.230> is<00:02:26.320> actually<00:02:26.650> start

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
location and rotation is actually start

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.360 
location and rotation is actually start
like<00:02:27.280> lock<00:02:27.580> rot<00:02:27.880> that's<00:02:28.510> what<00:02:28.660> it<00:02:28.750> says<00:02:28.990> here

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
like lock rot that's what it says here

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.080 
like lock rot that's what it says here
there's<00:02:30.390> all<00:02:31.390> kinds<00:02:31.660> of<00:02:31.690> stuff<00:02:32.490> let's<00:02:33.490> now<00:02:33.850> go

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
there's all kinds of stuff let's now go

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.370 
there's all kinds of stuff let's now go
to<00:02:34.150> frame<00:02:34.770> 70<00:02:35.770> let's<00:02:36.730> move<00:02:37.000> it<00:02:37.180> up<00:02:37.420> instead<00:02:38.230> of

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
to frame 70 let's move it up instead of

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.860 
to frame 70 let's move it up instead of
rotating<00:02:38.710> it<00:02:39.160> by<00:02:39.340> hand<00:02:39.580> like<00:02:39.880> that<00:02:39.910> because

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
rotating it by hand like that because

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.630 
rotating it by hand like that because
what<00:02:41.110> will<00:02:41.200> happen<00:02:41.260> there<00:02:41.740> is<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:44.610> what<00:02:45.610> you

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
what will happen there is the what you

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.450 
what will happen there is the what you
call<00:02:45.730> it<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.590> blender<00:02:47.590> we'll<00:02:47.710> just<00:02:47.950> find<00:02:48.280> the

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
call it the blender we'll just find the

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.180 
call it the blender we'll just find the
shortest<00:02:48.640> way<00:02:49.150> to<00:02:49.180> get<00:02:49.690> to<00:02:49.840> it<00:02:49.870> from<00:02:50.770> where<00:02:51.070> it

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
shortest way to get to it from where it

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.090 
shortest way to get to it from where it
originally<00:02:51.820> is<00:02:52.230> so<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:53.560> we'll<00:02:53.680> just<00:02:53.830> move<00:02:53.980> it

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
originally is so and we'll just move it

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.890 
originally is so and we'll just move it
up<00:02:54.190> again<00:02:54.490> so<00:02:55.060> I'm<00:02:55.120> going<00:02:55.240> to<00:02:55.270> move<00:02:55.420> it<00:02:55.540> up<00:02:55.660> here

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
up again so I'm going to move it up here

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.540 
up again so I'm going to move it up here
press<00:02:56.290> n<00:02:56.500> to<00:02:56.740> bring<00:02:56.920> up<00:02:57.010> this<00:02:57.130> little<00:02:57.280> window

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
press n to bring up this little window

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.240 
press n to bring up this little window
and<00:02:58.920> just<00:02:59.920> change<00:03:00.220> the<00:03:00.640> rotation<00:03:01.000> Lizzy<00:03:01.600> taxis

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
and just change the rotation Lizzy taxis

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.680 
and just change the rotation Lizzy taxis
something<00:03:03.250> like<00:03:03.370> that<00:03:03.430> and<00:03:03.760> i'm<00:03:04.510> going<00:03:04.630> to

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
something like that and i'm going to

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.160 
something like that and i'm going to
press<00:03:04.990> I<00:03:05.430> location<00:03:06.430> rotation<00:03:06.930> now<00:03:07.930> when<00:03:08.080> I

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
press I location rotation now when I

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.500 
press I location rotation now when I
take<00:03:08.380> a<00:03:08.410> look<00:03:08.710> at<00:03:09.160> this<00:03:09.430> animation<00:03:09.910> from<00:03:10.390> a

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
take a look at this animation from a

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.360 
take a look at this animation from a
different<00:03:10.810> angle<00:03:10.900> camera<00:03:11.620> view<00:03:11.980> might<00:03:12.160> do

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
different angle camera view might do

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.710 
different angle camera view might do
that<00:03:12.400> nice<00:03:12.760> to<00:03:13.660> close<00:03:13.930> up<00:03:15.030> you<00:03:16.030> press<00:03:16.270> alt<00:03:16.540> a

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
that nice to close up you press alt a

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.020 
that nice to close up you press alt a
and<00:03:16.990> they<00:03:17.800> see<00:03:17.860> it<00:03:18.040> doe<00:03:18.130> nice<00:03:18.310> twirl<00:03:18.640> and<00:03:18.850> come

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
and they see it doe nice twirl and come

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.350 
and they see it doe nice twirl and come
up<00:03:19.180> although<00:03:19.570> that<00:03:19.750> turns<00:03:19.960> quite<00:03:20.140> fast<00:03:20.410> so

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
up although that turns quite fast so

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.030 
up although that turns quite fast so
that's<00:03:22.360> a<00:03:22.720> simple<00:03:22.930> thing<00:03:23.290> for<00:03:23.320> ipod<00:03:23.710> but<00:03:23.830> let's

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
that's a simple thing for ipod but let's

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.680 
that's a simple thing for ipod but let's
say<00:03:24.280> i<00:03:24.930> I've<00:03:25.930> got<00:03:25.990> a<00:03:26.650> fine<00:03:27.610> rotation<00:03:28.390> thing<00:03:28.570> I

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
say i I've got a fine rotation thing I

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.530 
say i I've got a fine rotation thing I
just<00:03:28.720> want<00:03:28.870> it<00:03:29.080> to<00:03:29.190> move<00:03:30.190> to<00:03:30.580> the<00:03:30.820> right<00:03:31.120> as

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
just want it to move to the right as

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.980 
just want it to move to the right as
well<00:03:31.740> so<00:03:32.740> it<00:03:32.830> goes<00:03:32.860> woo<00:03:33.250> woo<00:03:33.670> a<00:03:33.940> little<00:03:34.750> 12

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990 
well so it goes woo woo a little 12

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:36.810 
well so it goes woo woo a little 12
that's<00:03:35.620> simple<00:03:36.040> you<00:03:36.130> don't<00:03:36.220> really<00:03:36.490> need<00:03:36.670> to

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
that's simple you don't really need to

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.780 
that's simple you don't really need to
change<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.300> rotation<00:03:37.480> as<00:03:38.020> well<00:03:38.490> just<00:03:39.490> go<00:03:39.730> to

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
change the rotation as well just go to

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.960 
change the rotation as well just go to
whatever<00:03:40.150> frame<00:03:40.420> 50<00:03:41.080> for<00:03:41.590> example<00:03:42.100> to<00:03:42.730> move

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
whatever frame 50 for example to move

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.810 
whatever frame 50 for example to move
its<00:03:43.150> over<00:03:43.450> here<00:03:44.910> there<00:03:45.910> and<00:03:46.780> just<00:03:47.020> press<00:03:47.200> I

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
its over here there and just press I

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.940 
its over here there and just press I
location<00:03:48.820> so<00:03:49.510> now<00:03:49.690> what<00:03:49.840> it's<00:03:49.990> done<00:03:50.230> is<00:03:50.470> as<00:03:50.830> you

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
location so now what it's done is as you

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.490 
location so now what it's done is as you
can<00:03:51.100> see<00:03:51.400> when<00:03:51.610> we've<00:03:52.000> got<00:03:52.330> a<00:03:52.810> key<00:03:53.170> frame<00:03:53.350> with

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
can see when we've got a key frame with

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.260 
can see when we've got a key frame with
both<00:03:53.680> of<00:03:53.709> them<00:03:53.980> they're<00:03:54.160> both<00:03:54.310> yellow<00:03:54.490> when

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.270 
both of them they're both yellow when

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:00.240 
both of them they're both yellow when
will<00:03:55.420> you<00:03:55.450> go<00:03:55.660> to<00:03:55.720> frame<00:03:56.410> where<00:03:57.930> it's<00:03:59.040> not<00:04:00.040> got

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
will you go to frame where it's not got

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.860 
will you go to frame where it's not got
any<00:04:00.430> key<00:04:00.670> frames<00:04:01.060> they're<00:04:01.450> both<00:04:01.540> green

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
any key frames they're both green

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.990 
any key frames they're both green
meaning<00:04:02.200> that<00:04:02.440> value<00:04:03.130> has<00:04:03.310> got<00:04:03.490> key<00:04:03.670> frames

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
meaning that value has got key frames

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.240 
meaning that value has got key frames
but<00:04:04.240> just<00:04:04.480> not<00:04:04.570> on<00:04:04.750> that<00:04:04.870> frame<00:04:05.110> when<00:04:05.920> I<00:04:06.040> go<00:04:06.220> to

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
but just not on that frame when I go to

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.820 
but just not on that frame when I go to
frame<00:04:06.730> 50<00:04:07.240> it's<00:04:07.510> only<00:04:07.720> got<00:04:07.930> to<00:04:08.050> location<00:04:08.620> for

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
frame 50 it's only got to location for

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.830 
frame 50 it's only got to location for
his<00:04:08.860> only<00:04:09.190> that<00:04:09.340> one<00:04:09.490> shows<00:04:09.700> yellow<00:04:10.030> so<00:04:10.630> now

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
his only that one shows yellow so now

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.710 
his only that one shows yellow so now
when<00:04:11.200> I<00:04:11.230> press<00:04:11.410> otay<00:04:11.950> you<00:04:12.940> can<00:04:13.120> see<00:04:13.360> then<00:04:13.690> is

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
when I press otay you can see then is

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.440 
when I press otay you can see then is
calculating<00:04:14.590> the<00:04:14.709> frames<00:04:15.010> in<00:04:15.250> between<00:04:15.450> those

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
calculating the frames in between those

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:22.409 
calculating the frames in between those
get<00:04:17.380> these<00:04:17.650> key<00:04:18.430> points<00:04:18.459> basically<00:04:20.489> it's<00:04:21.489> and

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
get these key points basically it's and

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:27.030 
get these key points basically it's and
also<00:04:23.190> as<00:04:24.190> I<00:04:25.000> say<00:04:25.300> because<00:04:25.960> it's<00:04:26.140> calculating

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
also as I say because it's calculating

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.800 
also as I say because it's calculating
it<00:04:27.190> leave<00:04:27.850> it<00:04:28.000> or<00:04:28.150> not<00:04:28.300> you<00:04:28.390> might<00:04:28.540> think<00:04:28.690> that

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
it leave it or not you might think that

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.690 
it leave it or not you might think that
frame<00:04:29.110> by<00:04:29.260> frame<00:04:29.290> gives<00:04:29.770> it<00:04:29.919> tiny<00:04:30.520> little

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
frame by frame gives it tiny little

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.219 
frame by frame gives it tiny little
values<00:04:31.180> but<00:04:31.870> look<00:04:32.020> frame<00:04:32.890> 0<00:04:33.450> the<00:04:34.450> rotation<00:04:34.990> is

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:35.229 
values but look frame 0 the rotation is

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:37.770 
values but look frame 0 the rotation is
at<00:04:35.470> zero<00:04:35.830> and<00:04:35.860> all<00:04:36.040> of<00:04:36.160> them<00:04:36.310> next<00:04:37.270> frame<00:04:37.510> is

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
at zero and all of them next frame is

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:38.870 
at zero and all of them next frame is
gone<00:04:38.080> up<00:04:38.110> to

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
gone up to

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.710 
gone up to
that's<00:04:39.690> you<00:04:40.350> know<00:04:40.470> so<00:04:40.920> it<00:04:41.280> that<00:04:42.090> just<00:04:42.270> shows

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
that's you know so it that just shows

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.160 
that's you know so it that just shows
how<00:04:42.750> evenly<00:04:43.560> blender<00:04:44.520> can<00:04:44.880> split<00:04:45.570> it<00:04:45.600> up<00:04:45.930> to

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170 
how evenly blender can split it up to

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.010 
how evenly blender can split it up to
make<00:04:46.290> it<00:04:46.820> you<00:04:47.820> know<00:04:47.850> when<00:04:48.210> we<00:04:48.630> look<00:04:48.840> at<00:04:48.930> this

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
make it you know when we look at this

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.570 
make it you know when we look at this
animation<00:04:49.410> it<00:04:49.620> looks<00:04:49.740> really<00:04:49.920> choppy<00:04:50.280> but

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
animation it looks really choppy but

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.170 
animation it looks really choppy but
when<00:04:50.730> we<00:04:50.850> speed<00:04:51.150> it<00:04:51.180> up<00:04:51.890> it<00:04:52.890> looks<00:04:53.310> just<00:04:53.520> fast

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
when we speed it up it looks just fast

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.580 
when we speed it up it looks just fast
so<00:04:55.170> that's<00:04:55.920> just<00:04:56.010> a<00:04:56.220> simple<00:04:56.550> i<00:04:56.760> po<00:04:57.140> thing<00:04:58.140> there

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
so that's just a simple i po thing there

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:59.810 
so that's just a simple i po thing there
but<00:04:58.860> i<00:04:58.890> wasn't<00:04:59.130> so<00:04:59.190> you<00:04:59.280> can<00:04:59.400> do<00:04:59.520> it<00:04:59.610> with

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
but i wasn't so you can do it with

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.690 
but i wasn't so you can do it with
materials<00:05:00.690> you<00:05:01.080> can<00:05:01.110> do<00:05:01.410> it<00:05:01.560> with<00:05:01.800> the

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
materials you can do it with the

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.510 
materials you can do it with the
compositor<00:05:03.420> for<00:05:03.690> example<00:05:04.080> let's<00:05:04.110> say<00:05:04.440> I<00:05:04.650> want

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
compositor for example let's say I want

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.790 
compositor for example let's say I want
it<00:05:06.120> to<00:05:06.150> be<00:05:06.360> blurry<00:05:06.870> at<00:05:07.110> the<00:05:07.230> beginning<00:05:09.800> render

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
it to be blurry at the beginning render

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.670 
it to be blurry at the beginning render
this<00:05:11.480> yes<00:05:12.480> unless<00:05:12.720> I<00:05:12.840> want<00:05:13.050> it<00:05:13.170> to<00:05:13.200> be<00:05:13.290> blurry

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
this yes unless I want it to be blurry

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.010 
this yes unless I want it to be blurry
at<00:05:13.950> the<00:05:14.040> beginning<00:05:14.550> i<00:05:14.820> would<00:05:15.270> add<00:05:15.360> my<00:05:15.720> blur

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
at the beginning i would add my blur

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:21.740 
at the beginning i would add my blur
node<00:05:17.330> stick<00:05:18.330> it<00:05:18.510> in<00:05:19.550> that<00:05:20.550> mr.<00:05:20.880> fast<00:05:21.150> going<00:05:21.510> to

it to be 10 by 10 here then later on it
i'm<00:05:35.850> going<00:05:36.030> to<00:05:36.120> insert<00:05:36.440> keyframe<00:05:37.440> here<00:05:37.940> skip

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
i'm going to insert keyframe here skip

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.010 
i'm going to insert keyframe here skip
to<00:05:38.970> some<00:05:39.780> later<00:05:40.110> on<00:05:40.410> point<00:05:40.710> and<00:05:40.950> change<00:05:41.220> it<00:05:41.520> to

to some later on point and change it to
five<00:05:43.020> by<00:05:43.470> five<00:05:44.240> insert<00:05:45.240> keyframe<00:05:45.690> so<00:05:46.320> now<00:05:46.470> you

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
five by five insert keyframe so now you

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.640 
five by five insert keyframe so now you
can<00:05:46.860> see<00:05:47.160> where<00:05:48.090> i<00:05:48.120> go<00:05:48.300> here<00:05:48.660> it's<00:05:49.410> set<00:05:49.620> to

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
can see where i go here it's set to

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.510 
can see where i go here it's set to
eight<00:05:49.860> so<00:05:50.820> that's<00:05:51.330> just<00:05:51.390> how<00:05:51.840> powerful<00:05:52.110> this<00:05:53.010> I
