00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:28.360
 How are we friends? 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.710
 tomorrow in the same place as in the 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.650
 last videoblog that was just 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.470
 two days today Sunday there should be a 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.059
 long video and you will not see it then it's 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.040
 apologize but also that 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:40.989
 you understand that I am traveling and that 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.650
 circumstances are what are 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.430
 first is to advance 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.940
 calama 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.879
 night calama 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.739
 then the circumstances are counted 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.090
 they are what they are and the first thing is to advance 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.000
 and I have to leave Madagascar already 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.969
 It's fine and it smells and I'm busy 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.980
 leave here the other day I gave you two 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:04.759
 options or I was going on Saturday I gave the 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.649
 Tuesday on a ship or on another good the 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:07.909
 two boats to me personally the two 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:10.520
 boats gave me a bit of bad 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.140
 but well there was no other then 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.450
 someone said in the comments very 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.430
 wisely that I for that to choose 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.480
 what is that for that is the screenwriter 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.400
 I'm going to cross the street now yes 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.240
 I'm on the boardwalk and it gives me a 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.840
 little shame to talk 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.840
 calama 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.770
 the other day on the blog we talked about that 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.600
 there were two possible boats to get out of 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.369
 here one went out on Saturday and another the 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.869
 Tuesday today is Sunday 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.119
 Clearly not collected Saturday 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.780
 but I was thinking about taking it and I 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.270
 It was very bad roll 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.400
 I do not know why the small thing I do not know for something 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.790
 I was not cool then the night of 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.790
 Friday to Saturday 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.770
 well I got really bad very bad 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:01.509
 be all the time going to the room 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.509
 bathroom to not give details 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.259
 and then regardless of that already 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.759
 It was almost clear that I was not going to go 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.890
 Saturday because it was bad and it was not 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.489
 demented plan on a ship two days of 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.080
 navigation in that sorry state 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:19.080
 and then I went to even then I left the 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.319
 port and above there was the dealer and 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:26.120

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.120
