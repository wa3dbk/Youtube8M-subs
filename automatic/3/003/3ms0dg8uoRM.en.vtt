00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
compost and a lot of places in the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.260 
compost and a lot of places in the
country<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:35.100> can't<00:00:35.370> just<00:00:35.640> go<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.210> store

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
country you can't just go to the store

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.180 
country you can't just go to the store
and<00:00:36.750> ask<00:00:36.960> for<00:00:37.079> compost<00:00:37.620> they<00:00:37.770> don't<00:00:37.980> even

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
carry it so my rule of thumb if you

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.950 
carry it so my rule of thumb if you
can't<00:00:41.129> find<00:00:41.309> compost<00:00:41.879> just<00:00:42.000> use<00:00:42.300> good<00:00:42.480> potting

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
can't find compost just use good potting

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
by the bag at different nurseries as

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.400 
by the bag at different nurseries as
well<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:57.300> lot<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.570> times<00:00:57.780> if<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:58.050> find<00:00:58.260> them

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
well and a lot of times if you find them

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.380 
well and a lot of times if you find them
on<00:00:58.530> sale<00:00:58.770> they're<00:00:58.949> not<00:00:59.070> very<00:00:59.309> expensive<00:00:59.730> and

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
on sale they're not very expensive and

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.529 
on sale they're not very expensive and
so<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:00.989> always<00:01:01.260> ask<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:02.190> this<00:01:02.760> compost<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.480> has

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
so I always ask is this compost that has

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.600 
so I always ask is this compost that has
chemicals<00:01:04.170> does<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.470> have<00:01:04.559> fertilizers<00:01:05.309> does

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
chemicals does it have fertilizers does

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.390 
chemicals does it have fertilizers does
it<00:01:05.760> have<00:01:05.880> weeds<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.650> so<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.770> soil<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.189> has

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
it have weeds in it so the soil that has

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.160 
it have weeds in it so the soil that has
been<00:01:08.580> baked<00:01:08.850> is<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.240> best<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:09.810> if<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:10.020> can

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
been baked is the best so if you can

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.899 
been baked is the best so if you can
find<00:01:10.439> any<00:01:10.680> soil<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.310> where<00:01:11.460> they<00:01:11.580> call<00:01:11.790> it

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
find any soil that where they call it

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.910 
find any soil that where they call it
baked<00:01:12.180> is<00:01:12.479> where<00:01:12.900> they<00:01:13.049> put<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.320> under<00:01:13.560> high

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
baked is where they put it under high

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.070 
baked is where they put it under high
temperatures<00:01:14.549> where<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.270> kills<00:01:15.509> all<00:01:15.840> the

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
temperatures where it kills all the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.859 
temperatures where it kills all the
seeds<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.920> kills<00:01:17.159> all<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.640> diseases<00:01:18.240> so

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
seeds and it kills all the diseases so

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.420 
seeds and it kills all the diseases so
you're<00:01:19.020> starting<00:01:19.409> off<00:01:19.560> with<00:01:19.799> soil<00:01:20.130> that's

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
you're starting off with soil that's

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.760 
you're starting off with soil that's
already<00:01:20.909> been<00:01:21.240> treated<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.869> should<00:01:21.900> do<00:01:22.530> wet

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
already been treated and should do wet

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.310 
already been treated and should do wet
really<00:01:23.159> well<00:01:23.580> for<00:01:23.939> many<00:01:24.180> years<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.750> come<00:01:24.990> so

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
really well for many years to come so

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.920 
really well for many years to come so
it's<00:01:25.950> easy<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.520> organic<00:01:27.210> garden<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.720> it's

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
it's easy to organic garden and it's

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.140 
it's easy to organic garden and it's
just<00:01:28.200> by<00:01:28.439> not<00:01:28.650> using<00:01:28.950> any<00:01:29.310> chemicals<00:01:29.909> that's

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150
