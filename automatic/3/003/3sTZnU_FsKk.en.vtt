Chelsea be able to see it from the High
Line<00:00:30.880> these<00:00:31.880> are<00:00:32.059> done<00:00:32.689> on<00:00:33.020> foam<00:00:33.649> core<00:00:33.980> and

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
Line these are done on foam core and

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.220 
Line these are done on foam core and
they're<00:00:34.489> going<00:00:34.579> to<00:00:34.670> be<00:00:34.790> put<00:00:35.149> on<00:00:35.390> the<00:00:35.660> wall<00:00:35.899> but

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
they're going to be put on the wall but

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.290 
they're going to be put on the wall but
it's<00:00:36.440> using<00:00:37.010> basically<00:00:37.399> the<00:00:37.550> same<00:00:37.760> techniques

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
it's using basically the same techniques

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.229 
it's using basically the same techniques
that<00:00:38.540> I<00:00:38.630> use<00:00:38.840> for<00:00:39.739> my<00:00:39.890> outdoor<00:00:40.130> art<00:00:40.670> so<00:00:41.120> the

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
that I use for my outdoor art so the

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:42.729 
that I use for my outdoor art so the
pieces<00:00:41.480> are<00:00:41.660> print<00:00:41.899> out<00:00:42.050> in<00:00:42.200> black<00:00:42.380> and<00:00:42.590> white

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
pieces are print out in black and white

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.970 
pieces are print out in black and white
and<00:00:43.160> then<00:00:43.370> paint<00:00:43.880> in<00:00:44.120> with<00:00:44.630> red<00:00:44.930> and<00:00:45.320> then

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
and then paint in with red and then

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.670 
and then paint in with red and then
varnishes<00:00:46.579> to<00:00:46.820> give<00:00:46.969> them<00:00:47.469> an<00:00:48.469> off-white

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
varnishes to give them an off-white

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.310 
varnishes to give them an off-white
color<00:00:49.309> and<00:00:49.670> then<00:00:50.149> the<00:00:50.270> smaller<00:00:50.570> pieces<00:00:50.870> are

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
color and then the smaller pieces are

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.549 
color and then the smaller pieces are
screen<00:00:51.739> prints<00:00:52.219> and<00:00:52.989> you<00:00:53.989> know<00:00:54.050> I<00:00:54.110> started<00:00:54.350> off

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
screen prints and you know I started off

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.080 
screen prints and you know I started off
reading<00:00:55.040> up<00:00:55.160> screen<00:00:55.489> prints<00:00:55.760> because<00:00:56.000> the

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
reading up screen prints because the

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.959 
reading up screen prints because the
larger<00:00:56.329> second<00:00:56.600> for<00:00:56.780> myself<00:00:57.200> was<00:00:57.379> 20<00:00:57.710> 18<00:00:58.489> by<00:00:58.610> 24

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
larger second for myself was 20 18 by 24

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:04.329 
larger second for myself was 20 18 by 24
to<00:00:59.329> 24<00:00:59.750> by<00:00:59.870> 36<00:00:59.899> and<00:01:00.860> so<00:01:01.700> I<00:01:02.000> would<00:01:02.870> use<00:01:03.339> images

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
to 24 by 36 and so I would use images

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.000 
to 24 by 36 and so I would use images
that<00:01:04.549> could<00:01:05.299> work<00:01:05.479> well<00:01:05.750> repeated<00:01:06.530> in<00:01:06.650> a<00:01:06.740> grid

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
that could work well repeated in a grid

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.090 
that could work well repeated in a grid
and<00:01:07.600> then<00:01:08.600> are<00:01:08.750> developed<00:01:09.229> using<00:01:09.290> a<00:01:09.619> lot<00:01:10.010> of

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
and then are developed using a lot of

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.399 
and then are developed using a lot of
wallpapers<00:01:10.729> that<00:01:10.820> would<00:01:11.330> work<00:01:11.540> seem<00:01:11.930> to<00:01:12.110> seem

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
wallpapers that would work seem to seem

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.980 
wallpapers that would work seem to seem
to<00:01:13.130> create<00:01:13.460> a<00:01:13.490> repeat<00:01:14.030> pattern<00:01:14.330> that<00:01:14.869> was

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
to create a repeat pattern that was

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.780 
to create a repeat pattern that was
another<00:01:15.200> way<00:01:15.470> to<00:01:15.530> cover<00:01:15.799> a<00:01:16.070> larger<00:01:16.460> amount<00:01:16.640> of

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
another way to cover a larger amount of

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.609 
another way to cover a larger amount of
space<00:01:17.030> without<00:01:17.210> revealing<00:01:17.689> the<00:01:17.930> limitations

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
space without revealing the limitations

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.600 
space without revealing the limitations
of<00:01:18.770> the<00:01:19.520> scale<00:01:19.850> a<00:01:20.240> lot<00:01:20.689> of<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:20.900> things<00:01:21.140> that

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
of the scale a lot of the things that

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.370 
of the scale a lot of the things that
could<00:01:22.610> be<00:01:22.760> seen<00:01:22.970> as<00:01:23.000> technical<00:01:23.630> limitations

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
could be seen as technical limitations

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.260 
could be seen as technical limitations
to<00:01:24.619> not<00:01:24.770> know<00:01:24.950> in<00:01:25.070> what<00:01:25.189> size<00:01:25.430> the<00:01:25.700> wall<00:01:25.880> is<00:01:26.119> a

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
to not know in what size the wall is a

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.679 
to not know in what size the wall is a
thing<00:01:27.110> that<00:01:27.290> I<00:01:27.320> adapted<00:01:27.920> to<00:01:28.130> a<00:01:28.159> stet

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
thing that I adapted to a stet

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:30.929 
thing that I adapted to a stet
in<00:01:28.899> a<00:01:28.960> way<00:01:29.109> that's<00:01:29.320> appealing<00:01:29.679> so<00:01:30.189> even<00:01:30.759> when<00:01:30.909> I

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
in a way that's appealing so even when I

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:32.730 
in a way that's appealing so even when I
do<00:01:31.060> know<00:01:31.329> the<00:01:31.780> size<00:01:32.020> of<00:01:32.170> the<00:01:32.229> wall

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
do know the size of the wall

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.969 
do know the size of the wall
I<00:01:32.770> still<00:01:33.249> use<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.840> ripping<00:01:35.229> and<00:01:35.439> overlapping

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
I still use the ripping and overlapping

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.749 
I still use the ripping and overlapping
to<00:01:36.520> mimic<00:01:37.000> the<00:01:37.600> feel<00:01:37.899> of<00:01:38.229> the<00:01:38.770> way<00:01:38.920> posters<00:01:39.520> get

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
to mimic the feel of the way posters get

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.699 
to mimic the feel of the way posters get
layered<00:01:40.000> up<00:01:40.210> on<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:40.479> streets<00:01:40.810> which<00:01:41.079> is<00:01:41.259> a<00:01:41.289> I
