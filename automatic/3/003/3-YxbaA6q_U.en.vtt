victorinox<00:00:30.240> website<00:00:30.630> has<00:00:30.810> them<00:00:31.050> for<00:00:31.230> 30<00:00:31.470> and

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
victorinox website has them for 30 and

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.930 
victorinox website has them for 30 and
typically<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.550> can<00:00:32.730> do<00:00:32.850> better<00:00:33.510> than<00:00:33.630> that<00:00:33.890> so

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
my guess would be about 20 bucks it has

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.619 
my guess would be about 20 bucks it has

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.320 
very functional as well most people just
use<00:05:13.199> the<00:05:13.560> large<00:05:13.800> blade<00:05:14.099> and<00:05:14.400> you<00:05:14.430> know<00:05:15.210> if

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
use the large blade and you know if

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.029 
use the large blade and you know if
that's<00:05:15.569> that's<00:05:15.960> great<00:05:16.020> that's<00:05:16.770> what<00:05:16.919> it's

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 
that's that's great that's what it's

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:19.129 
that's that's great that's what it's
there<00:05:17.069> for<00:05:17.219> and<00:05:17.639> they<00:05:18.300> roll<00:05:18.539> up<00:05:18.629> this<00:05:18.779> small

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:19.139 
there for and they roll up this small

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:22.610 
there for and they roll up this small
blade<00:05:19.409> and<00:05:20.000> what<00:05:21.000> I<00:05:21.029> do<00:05:21.150> is<00:05:21.300> I<00:05:21.690> get<00:05:22.050> this<00:05:22.229> as

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
blade and what I do is I get this as

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.100 
blade and what I do is I get this as
sharp<00:05:23.430> as<00:05:23.610> possible<00:05:24.150> and<00:05:24.300> I<00:05:24.419> just<00:05:24.569> keep<00:05:24.960> it

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
sharp as possible and I just keep it

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.369 
sharp as possible and I just keep it
keep<00:05:25.379> it<00:05:25.500> in<00:05:25.620> the<00:05:25.789> closed<00:05:26.789> position<00:05:26.939> and<00:05:27.569> if

00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:28.379 
keep it in the closed position and if

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:29.839 
keep it in the closed position and if
something<00:05:28.800> comes<00:05:28.979> up<00:05:29.219> that<00:05:29.250> needs<00:05:29.610> an

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:29.849 
something comes up that needs an

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:31.879 
something comes up that needs an
extremely<00:05:30.659> sharp<00:05:30.870> edge<00:05:31.080> I'll<00:05:31.469> pull<00:05:31.650> out<00:05:31.680> the

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:31.889 
extremely sharp edge I'll pull out the

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:34.550 
extremely sharp edge I'll pull out the
smaller<00:05:32.159> blade<00:05:32.690> that<00:05:33.690> doesn't<00:05:34.050> get<00:05:34.169> used<00:05:34.319> as

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
smaller blade that doesn't get used as

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.459 
smaller blade that doesn't get used as
much<00:05:34.800> and<00:05:35.270> typically<00:05:36.270> you<00:05:36.779> know<00:05:36.900> if<00:05:37.139> you<00:05:37.349> have

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:37.469 
much and typically you know if you have

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:39.950 
much and typically you know if you have
a<00:05:37.500> knife<00:05:37.860> like<00:05:38.069> this<00:05:38.449> again<00:05:39.449> these<00:05:39.659> small

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
a knife like this again these small

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.589 
a knife like this again these small
blade<00:05:40.259> will<00:05:40.560> be<00:05:40.909> sharper<00:05:41.909> because<00:05:42.060> it's<00:05:42.449> not

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:42.599 
blade will be sharper because it's not

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:46.159 
blade will be sharper because it's not
used<00:05:42.810> as<00:05:42.960> much<00:05:44.509> one<00:05:45.509> other<00:05:45.629> quick<00:05:45.930> thing<00:05:46.139> I

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:46.169 
used as much one other quick thing I

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:49.519
