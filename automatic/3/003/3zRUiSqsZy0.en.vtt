 A print cartridge of your HP printer needs to be replaced. The following steps are required for this. 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.911
 First, you need to turn on the printer. Press the power button. 

00:00:13.923 --> 00:00:22.856
 Then open the access door to the print cartridges. The cartridge carriage moves into the access area. Wait until the cartridge carriage stops moving. 

00:00:23.495 --> 00:00:30.063
 Then gently push on the front of the cartridge to be replaced to release it. 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.867
 Pull the cartridge out of the holder in your direction. 

00:00:34.577 --> 00:00:51.351
 Take the new cartridge out of the packaging. Remove the pink plastic tab. 

00:00:56.748 --> 00:01:02.162
 When handling the cartridge, pay attention to the electrical contacts and the ink nozzles. 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.435
 Do not touch them as this will cause clogged nozzles, 

00:01:08.763 --> 00:01:11.905
 Problems with the ink and damage to the contacts may result. 

00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:20.580
 Make sure you insert the replacement cartridge in the correct holder. Tricolor left and black right. 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:27.053
 Hold the cartridge up and down and slide it directly into the free bracket. 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:42.836
 When the cartridge is installed, close the access door to the cartridges. After that you have to align the printer. Touch on the control panel 

00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:48.541
 OK to start alignment. An alignment page is printed. 

00:01:53.701 --> 00:02:02.121
 Flip up the scanner cover. Then place the alignment page face down on the scanner glass so that it is against the front right. 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:18.838
 Close the scanner cover. Press OK on the control panel again to complete the alignment. 

00:02:19.513 --> 00:02:22.002
 You can now use the printer as usual.
