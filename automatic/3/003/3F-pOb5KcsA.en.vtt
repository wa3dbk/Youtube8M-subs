00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:31.679 
always figured we'd end up going out big
not<00:06:28.629> hold<00:06:29.529> up<00:06:29.889> and<00:06:30.159> some<00:06:30.399> rat's<00:06:30.759> nest<00:06:31.149> next<00:06:31.569> to

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:40.679 
I guess we're lucky we got as far as we

00:06:40.679 --> 00:06:45.700 
I guess we're lucky we got as far as we
did<00:06:42.559> say<00:06:43.559> them

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:45.710

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:56.360 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.920 

then<00:06:57.360> let's<00:06:57.750> do<00:06:58.200> it

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:00.930 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:08.290 

that's<00:07:01.930> a<00:07:02.050> random<00:07:02.410> revelation

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:08.300 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.429 

also<00:07:09.300> end<00:07:09.479> of<00:07:09.569> the<00:07:09.659> chapter<00:07:09.840> while<00:07:10.169> it<00:07:10.289> was<00:07:10.409> a

00:07:10.429 --> 00:07:10.439 
also end of the chapter while it was a

00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:11.950 
also end of the chapter while it was a
pretty<00:07:10.680> quick<00:07:11.189> chapter<00:07:11.550> it<00:07:11.610> only<00:07:11.699> took<00:07:11.849> about

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:11.960 
pretty quick chapter it only took about

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.260 
pretty quick chapter it only took about
23<00:07:12.960> minutes<00:07:13.349> to<00:07:13.650> do<00:07:13.800> not<00:07:14.729> counting<00:07:15.030> all<00:07:15.150> that

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:15.270 
23 minutes to do not counting all that

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:17.689 
23 minutes to do not counting all that
time<00:07:15.479> I<00:07:15.509> spent<00:07:15.689> in<00:07:16.020> the<00:07:16.229> upgrade<00:07:17.219> screen<00:07:17.550> I'm

00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:17.699 
time I spent in the upgrade screen I'm

00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:22.700 
time I spent in the upgrade screen I'm
guessing<00:07:18.169> but<00:07:19.169> uh<00:07:19.370> anyway<00:07:20.370> that's<00:07:21.710> pretty

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:22.710 
guessing but uh anyway that's pretty

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.760 
guessing but uh anyway that's pretty
much<00:07:22.830> it<00:07:22.889> for<00:07:23.599> this<00:07:24.599> chapter<00:07:24.960> it's<00:07:25.560> a<00:07:25.620> pretty

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:25.770 
much it for this chapter it's a pretty

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:27.980 
much it for this chapter it's a pretty
short<00:07:25.919> chapter<00:07:26.370> shorter<00:07:27.270> than<00:07:27.419> most<00:07:27.780> of<00:07:27.960> the

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:27.990 
short chapter shorter than most of the

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:29.300 
short chapter shorter than most of the
other<00:07:28.139> ones<00:07:28.349> I<00:07:28.500> don't<00:07:28.620> know<00:07:28.680> how<00:07:28.830> many<00:07:29.039> more

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:29.310 
other ones I don't know how many more

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:30.860 
other ones I don't know how many more
chapters<00:07:29.639> we<00:07:29.909> have<00:07:30.030> to<00:07:30.090> go<00:07:30.240> but<00:07:30.479> we're<00:07:30.689> getting

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:30.870 
chapters we have to go but we're getting

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:34.789 
chapters we have to go but we're getting
there<00:07:31.020> and<00:07:31.490> that's<00:07:32.490> about<00:07:32.639> it
