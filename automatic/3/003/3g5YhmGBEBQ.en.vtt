00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.829

 so you can now cut relaxed and fatigue-free her hedge 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.690
 by simply turning over the cutting blade you are now working on the 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.940
 Side parts of the hedge without changing the grip position 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.000
 When they are finished with the side panels, they pivot the handle into the frame 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.320
 appropriate position and continue cutting samples 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.390
 No matter which side of the hedge they cut the on topic noise Kuno Misha 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.870
 Handle position and the ideal balanced center of gravity allow for anytime

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.210
 the hedge trimmer slides force 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.980
 from and precisely over the hedge 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.500

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.700
