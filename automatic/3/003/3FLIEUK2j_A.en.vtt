fifteen<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.219> sixteen<00:00:44.579> percent<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:45.090> he<00:00:45.210> could

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
fifteen and sixteen percent so he could

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.600

I'm<00:00:50.730> sorry<00:00:50.969> MSD<00:00:51.960> capital<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:53.100> could<00:00:53.219> also

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
I'm sorry MSD capital and it could also

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.799 
I'm sorry MSD capital and it could also
be<00:00:53.489> part<00:00:53.789> of<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.969> deal<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.600> would<00:00:54.719> make

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
be part of the deal so that would make

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.330 
be part of the deal so that would make
it<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.989> little<00:00:55.289> bit<00:00:55.500> easier<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.250> know

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
it a little bit easier so that you know

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.860 
it a little bit easier so that you know
that's<00:00:56.430> three<00:00:56.760> or<00:00:56.879> four<00:00:57.059> billion<00:00:57.239> dollars<00:00:57.360> if

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
that's three or four billion dollars if

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.479 
that's three or four billion dollars if
it's<00:00:58.020> gets<00:00:58.199> priced<00:00:58.530> as<00:00:58.739> as<00:00:59.100> you'd<00:00:59.309> anticipate

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
it's gets priced as as you'd anticipate

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.010 
it's gets priced as as you'd anticipate
that's<00:00:59.910> three<00:01:00.149> or<00:01:00.239> four<00:01:00.359> billion<00:01:00.539> dollars<00:01:00.660> you

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
that's three or four billion dollars you

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.599 
that's three or four billion dollars you
don't<00:01:01.199> have<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.410> go<00:01:01.530> out<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.680> raise<00:01:02.010> plus<00:01:02.489> the

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
don't have to go out and raise plus the

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:03.830 
don't have to go out and raise plus the
company<00:01:02.879> does<00:01:03.000> have<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.180> lot<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.329> cash<00:01:03.570> on<00:01:03.750> the

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
company does have a lot of cash on the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.870 
company does have a lot of cash on the
balance<00:01:03.960> sheet<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:05.040> know<00:01:05.129> one<00:01:05.280> thing<00:01:05.430> in<00:01:05.519> the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
balance sheet you know one thing in the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.520 
balance sheet you know one thing in the
favor<00:01:06.119> of<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.600> private<00:01:06.869> equity<00:01:07.140> funds<00:01:07.350> and

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
favor of the private equity funds and

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.380 
favor of the private equity funds and
the<00:01:07.590> banks<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.890> do<00:01:08.040> this<00:01:08.220> deal<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:08.909> you

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
the banks to do this deal is that you

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.969 
the banks to do this deal is that you
can<00:01:09.720> borrow<00:01:09.930> cheaply<00:01:10.320> right<00:01:10.680> now<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:10.890> that's

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
can borrow cheaply right now and that's

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.320 
can borrow cheaply right now and that's
part<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.580> rationale<00:01:11.970> we're<00:01:12.090> trying<00:01:12.270> to

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
part of the rationale we're trying to

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.510 
part of the rationale we're trying to
get<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.450> transaction<00:01:12.990> done<00:01:13.140> right<00:01:13.320> now<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:14.400> we

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
get a transaction done right now so we

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.359 
get a transaction done right now so we
know<00:01:14.670> pc<00:01:15.090> sales<00:01:15.360> are<00:01:15.720> dropping<00:01:16.110> but<00:01:16.710> why<00:01:17.009> would

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
know pc sales are dropping but why would

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.370 
know pc sales are dropping but why would
Michael<00:01:17.580> Dell<00:01:17.909> want<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.810> sell<00:01:18.960> his<00:01:19.170> baby

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
Michael Dell want to sell his baby

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.530 
Michael Dell want to sell his baby
here's<00:01:20.340> what<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.520> would<00:01:20.640> say<00:01:20.790> one<00:01:21.210> he<00:01:21.390> would

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
here's what I would say one he would

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.820 
here's what I would say one he would
