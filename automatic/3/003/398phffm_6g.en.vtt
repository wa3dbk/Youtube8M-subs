ya flip it up and I never flip this one
up<00:02:46.130> and<00:02:46.790> it's<00:02:47.000> not<00:02:47.120> gonna<00:02:47.210> go<00:02:47.480> so<00:02:48.170> if<00:02:48.320> that

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
up and it's not gonna go so if that

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.650 
up and it's not gonna go so if that
happens<00:02:48.920> you<00:02:49.850> can<00:02:50.090> just<00:02:50.270> pull<00:02:51.230> it<00:02:51.340> to<00:02:52.480> make<00:02:53.480> it

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
happens you can just pull it to make it

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:06.820 
happens you can just pull it to make it
a<00:02:53.690> little<00:02:53.990> wider<00:03:05.380> there<00:03:06.380> we<00:03:06.470> go

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
a little wider there we go

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.210 
a little wider there we go
yay<00:03:07.459> so<00:03:08.420> yeah<00:03:08.570> if<00:03:08.840> it's<00:03:09.020> too<00:03:09.410> if<00:03:09.650> it's<00:03:09.800> not<00:03:09.950> wide

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
yay so yeah if it's too if it's not wide

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.120 
yay so yeah if it's too if it's not wide
enough<00:03:10.250> to<00:03:10.550> flip<00:03:10.910> up<00:03:11.120> just<00:03:11.900> pull<00:03:12.170> on<00:03:12.470> the<00:03:12.860> metal

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
enough to flip up just pull on the metal

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.290 
enough to flip up just pull on the metal
and<00:03:13.459> that<00:03:14.239> will<00:03:14.480> make<00:03:14.630> it<00:03:14.690> wider<00:03:15.850> so<00:03:16.850> that<00:03:16.880> it

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
and that will make it wider so that it

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.910 
and that will make it wider so that it
can<00:03:17.510> live<00:03:17.660> up<00:03:17.810> there<00:03:17.989> and<00:03:18.050> you<00:03:18.380> can<00:03:18.500> see<00:03:18.650> it<00:03:18.800> up
