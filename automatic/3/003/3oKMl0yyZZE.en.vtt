00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
and we now can do that so we know we're

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.169 
and we now can do that so we know we're
no<00:01:53.259> longer<00:01:53.740> locked<00:01:54.219> into<00:01:54.579> the<00:01:54.759> screen<00:01:55.030> where

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
we had to choose ctrl alt to get out we

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.070 
we had to choose ctrl alt to get out we
can<00:01:57.939> actually<00:01:58.210> go<00:01:58.479> in<00:01:58.719> we<00:01:59.470> can<00:01:59.649> go<00:01:59.770> out<00:01:59.979> of<00:02:01.080> the

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
can actually go in we can go out of the

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.080 
can actually go in we can go out of the
screen<00:02:02.830> between<00:02:02.979> the<00:02:03.250> host<00:02:03.459> and<00:02:03.610> the<00:02:03.729> virtual

screen between the host and the virtual

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.969 
screen between the host and the virtual
machine<00:02:04.420> so<00:02:04.630> we<00:02:04.720> know<00:02:04.869> that<00:02:04.899> the<00:02:05.200> integration

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
machine so we know that the integration

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.599 
machine so we know that the integration
tools<00:02:06.399> have<00:02:06.909> now<00:02:07.149> been<00:02:07.360> installed
