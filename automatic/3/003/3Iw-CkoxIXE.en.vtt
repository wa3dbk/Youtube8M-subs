00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
if you finish them in oil really hard to

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.030 
if you finish them in oil really hard to
beat<00:01:44.549> in<00:01:44.700> terms<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:45.060> pure<00:01:45.240> beauty<00:01:45.860> when<00:01:46.860> those

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
beat in terms of pure beauty when those

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.950 
beat in terms of pure beauty when those
two<00:01:47.220> colors<00:01:47.460> contrast<00:01:48.210> against<00:01:48.630> each<00:01:48.750> other

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
two colors contrast against each other

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.800 
two colors contrast against each other
terms<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.130> tap<00:01:50.340> tone<00:01:50.580> walnut<00:01:51.119> is<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.330> little<00:01:51.690> bit

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
terms of tap tone walnut is a little bit

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:59.060 
terms of tap tone walnut is a little bit
harder<00:01:52.590> denser<00:01:53.220> wood<00:01:57.259> this<00:01:58.259> piece<00:01:58.500> obviously

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
harder denser wood this piece obviously

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.639 
harder denser wood this piece obviously
doesn't<00:02:00.030> have<00:02:00.060> such<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.390> great<00:02:00.690> tap<00:02:00.960> tone<00:02:01.229> as

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
doesn't have such a great tap tone as

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.840 
doesn't have such a great tap tone as
some<00:02:01.860> other<00:02:02.070> woods<00:02:02.250> I've<00:02:02.399> demonstrated<00:02:04.850> now

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
some other woods I've demonstrated now

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.960 
some other woods I've demonstrated now
there<00:02:06.030> are<00:02:06.180> some<00:02:06.420> nuts<00:02:06.750> in<00:02:07.049> it<00:02:07.399> it<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.550> flat

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
there are some nuts in it it is flat

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.840 
there are some nuts in it it is flat
song<00:02:09.679> so<00:02:10.679> this<00:02:10.860> definitely<00:02:11.310> is<00:02:11.459> not<00:02:11.489> going<00:02:11.790> to

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
song so this definitely is not going to

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.870 
song so this definitely is not going to
make<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.030> great<00:02:12.360> sounding<00:02:12.780> guitar<00:02:13.700> but<00:02:14.700> if<00:02:14.790> I

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
make a great sounding guitar but if I

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.300 
make a great sounding guitar but if I
plane<00:02:15.239> down<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:16.140> know<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.260> little<00:02:16.440> bit<00:02:16.680> get<00:02:17.280> a

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
plane down you know a little bit get a

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.310 
plane down you know a little bit get a
maple<00:02:17.700> top<00:02:17.910> on<00:02:18.120> that<00:02:18.150> maple<00:02:18.750> top<00:02:18.989> will<00:02:19.170> have

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
maple top on that maple top will have

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.770 
maple top on that maple top will have
some<00:02:19.560> spring<00:02:20.070> to<00:02:20.100> it<00:02:20.610> should<00:02:21.330> sound<00:02:21.540> pretty

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
some spring to it should sound pretty

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.390

good<00:02:21.900> you<00:02:22.290> know<00:02:22.380> if<00:02:22.500> I<00:02:22.590> hollowed<00:02:22.920> out<00:02:23.010> maybe<00:02:23.340> I

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
good you know if I hollowed out maybe I

good you know if I hollowed out maybe I
can<00:02:23.550> change<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.910> resonance<00:02:24.360> but<00:02:25.080> definitely

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
can change the resonance but definitely

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.340 
the burl and sticking out on the tree
this<00:04:29.460> is<00:04:29.670> the<00:04:29.790> base<00:04:30.000> this<00:04:30.390> is<00:04:30.720> the<00:04:30.990> tree<00:04:31.200> then

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
this is the base this is the tree then

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.640 
this is the base this is the tree then
growing<00:04:31.620> out<00:04:31.920> and<00:04:32.190> as<00:04:33.030> you<00:04:33.060> cut<00:04:33.650> book-matched

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
growing out and as you cut book-matched

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.460 
growing out and as you cut book-matched
blacks<00:04:35.220> out<00:04:35.490> of<00:04:35.550> this<00:04:35.850> you<00:04:36.600> know<00:04:36.690> this<00:04:36.870> is<00:04:37.080> how

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
blacks out of this you know this is how

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.520 
blacks out of this you know this is how
the<00:04:37.530> book<00:04:37.860> match<00:04:38.100> is<00:04:38.310> coming<00:04:38.490> out<00:04:38.790> of<00:04:38.820> this<00:04:39.030> is

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
the book match is coming out of this is

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.220 
the book match is coming out of this is
like<00:04:40.530> this<00:04:41.270> so<00:04:42.270> it<00:04:42.330> depends<00:04:42.690> on<00:04:42.750> how<00:04:42.870> you<00:04:42.930> cut

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
like this so it depends on how you cut

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:44.630 
like this so it depends on how you cut
into<00:04:43.350> the<00:04:43.530> burl<00:04:43.740> your<00:04:43.980> figure<00:04:44.250> will<00:04:44.400> look<00:04:44.550> a

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
into the burl your figure will look a

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.030 
into the burl your figure will look a
lot<00:04:44.820> different<00:04:45.240> I<00:04:45.270> decided<00:04:45.630> to<00:04:45.810> go<00:04:45.960> with<00:04:46.040> the

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
lot different I decided to go with the

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.410 
lot different I decided to go with the
way<00:04:47.190> it<00:04:47.310> was<00:04:47.430> growing<00:04:47.730> just<00:04:48.030> because<00:04:48.300> that's

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
way it was growing just because that's

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.450 
way it was growing just because that's
how<00:04:48.630> most<00:04:48.810> of<00:04:49.020> my<00:04:49.110> pieces<00:04:49.380> come<00:04:49.710> up<00:04:49.890> came<00:04:50.250> off

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
how most of my pieces come up came off

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.130 
how most of my pieces come up came off
when<00:04:50.670> you<00:04:50.790> get<00:04:50.940> a<00:04:50.970> really<00:04:51.240> significantly

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
when you get a really significantly

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.800 
when you get a really significantly
sized<00:04:52.500> burl<00:04:53.040> you<00:04:53.820> know<00:04:53.880> over<00:04:54.090> six<00:04:54.480> feet<00:04:54.690> in

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
sized burl you know over six feet in

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.870 
sized burl you know over six feet in
diameter<00:04:54.980> you<00:04:55.980> could<00:04:56.160> do<00:04:56.280> tons<00:04:56.610> of<00:04:56.790> different

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
diameter you could do tons of different

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.420 
diameter you could do tons of different
cuts<00:04:57.360> so<00:04:58.169> you're<00:04:58.290> not<00:04:58.380> necessarily<00:04:58.560> won't<00:04:59.220> get

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
cuts so you're not necessarily won't get

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.230 
cuts so you're not necessarily won't get
that<00:04:59.669> straight<00:05:00.419> up-and-down<00:05:00.690> cut<00:05:02.060> but<00:05:03.060> this

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
that straight up-and-down cut but this

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.800 
that straight up-and-down cut but this
is<00:05:03.419> the<00:05:03.570> raw<00:05:03.720> Claro<00:05:04.169> walnut<00:05:04.800> burl<00:05:05.630> yeah<00:05:06.630> this

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
is the raw Claro walnut burl yeah this

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.750 
is the raw Claro walnut burl yeah this
is<00:05:06.960> foreign<00:05:07.290> slab<00:05:07.650> it's<00:05:07.919> been<00:05:08.070> air<00:05:08.220> drying<00:05:08.460> for

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
is foreign slab it's been air drying for

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.030 
is foreign slab it's been air drying for
two<00:05:08.910> years<00:05:09.240> you<00:05:10.140> know<00:05:10.200> this<00:05:10.350> will<00:05:10.500> be<00:05:10.560> the<00:05:10.650> next

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 
two years you know this will be the next

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.950 
two years you know this will be the next
on<00:05:11.160> the<00:05:11.190> bandsaw<00:05:11.760> to<00:05:11.790> cut<00:05:11.940> up<00:05:12.300> on<00:05:12.450> my<00:05:12.600> Laguna

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
on the bandsaw to cut up on my Laguna

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.670 
on the bandsaw to cut up on my Laguna
you<00:05:13.800> know<00:05:13.890> I'll<00:05:14.430> put<00:05:14.610> an<00:05:14.730> edge<00:05:14.850> on<00:05:15.060> it<00:05:15.560> cut<00:05:16.560> it

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
you know I'll put an edge on it cut it

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.740 
you know I'll put an edge on it cut it
in<00:05:16.770> a<00:05:16.830> couple<00:05:17.100> pieces<00:05:17.280> you<00:05:17.580> can<00:05:17.730> see<00:05:17.940> when<00:05:18.660> you

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
in a couple pieces you can see when you

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.350 
in a couple pieces you can see when you
air<00:05:18.960> dry<00:05:19.460> you<00:05:20.460> know<00:05:20.550> the<00:05:20.640> wood<00:05:20.850> starts<00:05:21.210> to

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
air dry you know the wood starts to

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.390 
air dry you know the wood starts to
shrink<00:05:21.750> and<00:05:21.900> you<00:05:21.990> get<00:05:22.200> checks<00:05:22.560> and<00:05:22.800> inclusions

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
shrink and you get checks and inclusions

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.150 
shrink and you get checks and inclusions
in<00:05:23.760> it<00:05:24.510> so<00:05:24.750> air<00:05:24.960> drying<00:05:25.200> the<00:05:25.380> wood<00:05:25.560> like<00:05:26.130> this

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
in it so air drying the wood like this

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.909 
in it so air drying the wood like this
definitely<00:05:26.790> takes<00:05:27.000> some<00:05:27.240> time<00:05:27.710> but<00:05:28.710> I<00:05:28.740> think

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 
definitely takes some time but I think

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:30.110 
definitely takes some time but I think
when<00:05:29.040> you<00:05:29.130> air<00:05:29.370> dry<00:05:29.610> you<00:05:29.669> get<00:05:29.850> a<00:05:29.910> little<00:05:30.060> bit

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
when you air dry you get a little bit

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.510 
when you air dry you get a little bit
better<00:05:30.300> figure<00:05:30.630> than<00:05:31.500> kiln<00:05:31.919> drying<00:05:32.280> only

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
better figure than kiln drying only

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.000 
better figure than kiln drying only
because<00:05:32.850> the<00:05:33.419> wood<00:05:33.660> oxidizes<00:05:34.470> differently

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
because the wood oxidizes differently

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.490 
because the wood oxidizes differently
over<00:05:35.160> time<00:05:35.280> the<00:05:36.270> ones<00:05:36.479> coming<00:05:36.720> out<00:05:36.960> of<00:05:37.110> a<00:05:37.200> kiln

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
over time the ones coming out of a kiln

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.500 
over time the ones coming out of a kiln
so<00:05:38.310> there's<00:05:38.430> a<00:05:38.490> lot<00:05:38.580> of<00:05:38.700> guys<00:05:38.850> that<00:05:39.060> won't<00:05:39.210> buy

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
so there's a lot of guys that won't buy

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.900 
so there's a lot of guys that won't buy
air<00:05:40.350> dried<00:05:40.770> wood<00:05:41.040> but<00:05:41.340> really<00:05:41.610> just<00:05:41.640> got<00:05:41.880> to

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
air dried wood but really just got to

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.430 
air dried wood but really just got to
know<00:05:42.060> what<00:05:42.180> you're<00:05:42.330> doing<00:05:42.450> to<00:05:42.930> make<00:05:43.110> sure<00:05:43.290> you

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
know what you're doing to make sure you

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.440 
know what you're doing to make sure you
dry<00:05:43.650> correctly<00:05:44.250> that<00:05:44.850> you're<00:05:45.030> not<00:05:45.150> getting

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.450 
dry correctly that you're not getting

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.510 
dry correctly that you're not getting
checks<00:05:45.810> and<00:05:46.200> that<00:05:46.680> when<00:05:46.800> you<00:05:46.890> get<00:05:47.010> down<00:05:47.250> to<00:05:47.400> the

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
checks and that when you get down to the

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.370 
checks and that when you get down to the
smaller<00:05:47.820> pieces<00:05:48.180> you<00:05:48.660> know<00:05:48.900> you<00:05:48.960> got<00:05:49.200> some

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
smaller pieces you know you got some

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.950 
smaller pieces you know you got some
stability<00:05:49.950> when<00:05:50.130> you're<00:05:50.280> cutting<00:05:50.460> into<00:05:50.760> it<00:05:50.970> so

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
stability when you're cutting into it so

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.659 
stability when you're cutting into it so
when<00:05:52.110> you<00:05:52.229> first<00:05:52.410> get<00:05:52.650> the<00:05:52.830> burl<00:05:53.100> you<00:05:53.550> know<00:05:53.640> I

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669 
when you first get the burl you know I

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:55.880 
when you first get the burl you know I
cut<00:05:53.970> into<00:05:54.120> it<00:05:54.330> you<00:05:54.990> get<00:05:55.169> significant<00:05:55.710> amount

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:55.890 
cut into it you get significant amount

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.820 
cut into it you get significant amount
of<00:05:55.950> checks<00:05:56.390> but<00:05:57.390> as<00:05:57.510> it<00:05:57.690> dries<00:05:57.930> overtime<00:05:58.560> and

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
of checks but as it dries overtime and

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.310 
of checks but as it dries overtime and
the<00:05:58.890> wood<00:05:59.040> starts<00:05:59.400> to<00:05:59.550> stabilize<00:06:00.140> these<00:06:01.140> are

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320 
the wood starts to stabilize these are

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.320 
the wood starts to stabilize these are
the<00:06:01.380> two<00:06:01.530> different<00:06:01.890> types<00:06:02.070> of<00:06:02.250> walnut<00:06:02.610> you

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
the two different types of walnut you

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.060 
the two different types of walnut you
know<00:06:03.419> the<00:06:03.570> Claro<00:06:03.840> walnut<00:06:04.289> I<00:06:04.320> would<00:06:04.530> definitely

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.070 
know the Claro walnut I would definitely

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.690 
know the Claro walnut I would definitely
use<00:06:05.100> four<00:06:05.870> taps

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:07.700 
use four taps

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.010 
use four taps
regular<00:06:08.700> walnut<00:06:09.150> I<00:06:09.180> would<00:06:09.390> use<00:06:09.540> for<00:06:09.570> backs

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020 
regular walnut I would use for backs

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.020 
regular walnut I would use for backs
with<00:06:10.320> a<00:06:10.350> maple<00:06:10.860> ball<00:06:11.250> tap<00:06:11.520> because<00:06:11.730> that<00:06:12.000> I
