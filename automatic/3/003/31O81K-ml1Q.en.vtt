00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
push rods would still turn yeah if I'm

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.930 
push rods would still turn yeah if I'm
gorilla<00:04:04.180> grip<00:04:04.630> I<00:04:04.810> might<00:04:05.080> be<00:04:05.260> able<00:04:05.380> to<00:04:05.500> turn<00:04:05.740> it

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
gorilla grip I might be able to turn it

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.910 
gorilla grip I might be able to turn it
but<00:04:06.940> as<00:04:07.060> you<00:04:07.210> can<00:04:07.330> see<00:04:07.540> in<00:04:07.690> here<00:04:07.930> it<00:04:08.470> doesn't

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
but as you can see in here it doesn't

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.560 
but as you can see in here it doesn't
turn<00:04:09.040> and<00:04:09.370> I'm<00:04:09.460> not<00:04:09.580> really<00:04:09.730> worried<00:04:10.090> about<00:04:10.120> it

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
turn and I'm not really worried about it

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.900 
turn and I'm not really worried about it
because<00:04:11.320> I'm<00:04:11.710> reaching<00:04:12.070> zero<00:04:12.250> lash<00:04:12.700> and

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
because I'm reaching zero lash and

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.700 
because I'm reaching zero lash and
that's<00:04:13.030> what<00:04:13.120> I'm<00:04:13.180> looking<00:04:13.420> for<00:04:13.630> and<00:04:14.470> then

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:14.710 
that's what I'm looking for and then

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.280 
that's what I'm looking for and then
half<00:04:14.890> a<00:04:14.920> turn<00:04:15.989> approximately<00:04:16.989> right<00:04:17.080> there

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
half a turn approximately right there

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.850 
half a turn approximately right there
half<00:04:18.040> a<00:04:18.070> turn<00:04:18.340> no<00:04:18.550> more<00:04:18.870> and<00:04:19.870> now<00:04:20.410> those<00:04:20.620> two

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:20.860 
half a turn no more and now those two

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.140 
half a turn no more and now those two
are<00:04:20.890> adjusted<00:04:21.550> and<00:04:21.930> that's<00:04:22.930> how<00:04:23.110> you<00:04:23.170> do<00:04:23.500> that

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
are adjusted and that's how you do that

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.200 
are adjusted and that's how you do that
of<00:04:25.150> course<00:04:25.450> I<00:04:25.600> consider<00:04:26.400> jam<00:04:27.400> nuts<00:04:27.640> on<00:04:27.790> top<00:04:27.820> of

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
of course I consider jam nuts on top of

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.120 
of course I consider jam nuts on top of
these<00:04:28.330> there<00:04:28.900> shouldn't<00:04:29.260> be<00:04:29.350> jam<00:04:29.710> nuts<00:04:29.950> on

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
these there shouldn't be jam nuts on

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.130 
these there shouldn't be jam nuts on
here<00:04:30.340> but<00:04:30.550> someone<00:04:31.360> put<00:04:31.390> jam<00:04:31.750> nuts<00:04:31.990> on<00:04:32.110> it

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
here but someone put jam nuts on it

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.170 
here but someone put jam nuts on it
anyway<00:04:32.530> and<00:04:32.710> I'm<00:04:32.800> going<00:04:33.040> I'm<00:04:33.490> going<00:04:33.550> to<00:04:33.820> put

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
anyway and I'm going I'm going to put

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.290 
anyway and I'm going I'm going to put
them<00:04:34.270> right<00:04:34.300> back<00:04:34.420> on<00:04:35.550> due<00:04:36.550> to<00:04:36.670> the<00:04:36.760> fact<00:04:37.000> that

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
them right back on due to the fact that

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.780 
them right back on due to the fact that
this<00:04:38.020> stuff<00:04:38.230> is<00:04:38.380> kind<00:04:38.620> of<00:04:38.680> loose<00:04:38.860> where<00:04:39.670> those

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
this stuff is kind of loose where those

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.910 
this stuff is kind of loose where those
nuts<00:04:40.060> don't<00:04:40.270> seem<00:04:40.450> to<00:04:40.540> have<00:04:40.630> enough<00:04:40.920> tension

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 
nuts don't seem to have enough tension

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.070 
nuts don't seem to have enough tension
on<00:04:42.220> them<00:04:42.480> when<00:04:43.480> I'm<00:04:43.570> tightening<00:04:43.870> them<00:04:44.050> down

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
on them when I'm tightening them down

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.600 
on them when I'm tightening them down
that<00:04:44.560> you<00:04:44.680> would<00:04:44.800> feel<00:04:45.040> from<00:04:46.000> a<00:04:46.090> standard<00:04:46.570> a

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
that you would feel from a standard a

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.370 
that you would feel from a standard a
lot<00:04:48.610> of<00:04:48.820> nuts<00:04:48.970> on<00:04:49.210> there<00:04:49.510> because<00:04:50.020> they're

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
lot of nuts on there because they're

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.320 
lot of nuts on there because they're
apparently<00:04:50.800> they're<00:04:51.190> like<00:04:51.340> spats<00:04:51.940> wedged

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
apparently they're like spats wedged

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.700 
apparently they're like spats wedged
that<00:04:52.920> they're<00:04:53.920> like<00:04:54.100> nylock<00:04:54.580> nuts<00:04:55.290> and<00:04:56.290> they

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
that they're like nylock nuts and they

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.610 
that they're like nylock nuts and they
will<00:04:56.860> seat<00:04:57.250> I<00:04:58.170> had<00:04:59.170> that<00:04:59.320> in<00:04:59.470> there<00:04:59.590> right

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
will seat I had that in there right

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:05.820 
will seat I had that in there right
first<00:04:59.980> time<00:05:00.130> and<00:05:02.940> they<00:05:03.940> won't<00:05:04.090> turn<00:05:04.390> but<00:05:05.230> means

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
first time and they won't turn but means

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.250 
first time and they won't turn but means
that<00:05:06.280> is<00:05:06.430> not<00:05:06.580> the<00:05:06.730> case<00:05:06.880> here<00:05:06.990> we<00:05:07.990> want<00:05:08.200> to

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
that is not the case here we want to

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.040 
that is not the case here we want to
make<00:05:08.380> sure<00:05:08.490> that<00:05:09.490> we<00:05:09.610> get<00:05:09.760> things<00:05:10.030> tight<00:05:10.750> and

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
make sure that we get things tight and

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:16.200 
make sure that we get things tight and
back<00:05:11.380> off<00:05:12.330> and<00:05:13.330> that<00:05:13.990> Panisse<00:05:15.060> gymnast<00:05:16.060> will

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
back off and that Panisse gymnast will

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.910 
back off and that Panisse gymnast will
be<00:05:16.360> trick<00:05:16.660> now<00:05:17.320> you<00:05:17.380> don't<00:05:17.500> hit<00:05:17.620> the<00:05:17.650> top<00:05:17.890> of

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:17.920 
be trick now you don't hit the top of

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.190 
be trick now you don't hit the top of
the<00:05:18.070> rocker<00:05:18.250> cover<00:05:18.370> system<00:05:18.820> that's<00:05:19.720> nice<00:05:19.960> too

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.200 
the rocker cover system that's nice too

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.330 
the rocker cover system that's nice too
there<00:05:20.800> we<00:05:20.920> go

runs now and do a compression check and

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.970 
runs now and do a compression check and
see<00:05:34.600> what<00:05:34.690> my<00:05:34.780> compression<00:05:35.110> is

see what my compression is
like<00:05:36.190> I<00:05:36.280> said<00:05:36.340> I<00:05:36.460> had<00:05:36.640> zero<00:05:36.670> on<00:05:37.270> cylinders<00:05:38.260> 1<00:05:38.500> 2

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
like I said I had zero on cylinders 1 2

like I said I had zero on cylinders 1 2
&amp;<00:05:39.040> 3<00:05:39.690> 1<00:05:40.690> 32<00:05:41.200> 135<00:05:42.100> on<00:05:42.340> most<00:05:42.520> of<00:05:42.700> them<00:05:42.790> then

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
&amp; 3 1 32 135 on most of them then

&amp; 3 1 32 135 on most of them then
cylinder<00:05:43.300> 8<00:05:43.390> back<00:05:43.570> then<00:05:43.750> and<00:05:43.840> back<00:05:43.960> was<00:05:44.140> 125

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
cylinder 8 back then and back was 125

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.790 
cylinder 8 back then and back was 125
and<00:05:45.160> I'm<00:05:45.300> expecting<00:05:46.300> all<00:05:46.510> these<00:05:46.720> to<00:05:47.200> improve

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
and I'm expecting all these to improve

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.520 
and I'm expecting all these to improve
after<00:05:48.730> all<00:05:49.000> the<00:05:49.090> valves<00:05:49.270> are<00:05:49.450> done<00:05:49.600> ok<00:05:49.930> be<00:05:50.350> back

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:50.530 
after all the valves are done ok be back

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:50.940 
after all the valves are done ok be back
in<00:05:50.620> a<00:05:50.680> minute

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:50.950 
in a minute

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:56.010 
in a minute
or<00:05:51.910> probably<00:05:52.750> in<00:05:52.870> about<00:05:52.930> an<00:05:53.110> hour<00:05:53.260> so<00:05:53.710> ok
