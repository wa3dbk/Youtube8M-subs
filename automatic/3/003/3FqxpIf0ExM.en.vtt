00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.020
 and great personality of a large barn seriado vigilante 'road 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:10.810
 we have here the presence of carlos miranda callos our huge pleasure to be here 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.729
 with your presence we are flattered by the city são paulo 

00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:18.279
 It was in the first place I want to congratulate all those who 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:23.570
 with six specials in particular because you are redeeming some of the 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.220
 Brazilian memory 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.560
 and it was here in the stall 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.880
 and it all started I started in 1951 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:35.440
 working in the maristela film first with dead and so on 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.990
 then as production assistant 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.440
 and parallel to the work of the maristela I do the popular theater of sesi 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.580
 and when to curl 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.040
 if the whole process of modernization in television 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.390
 It was a research done so we know what we want to do. 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.620
 on television that television was just created 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.240
 then we came to the conclusion that we needed to have a Brazilian hero 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.700
 to speak our language 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.250
 and was born practically that in the jaçanã 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.250
 with alfredo palaces with ari fernandes 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.150
 After several tests, I ended up being chosen and having God's wings. 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.150
 we did vigilantism 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.280
 carlos today the Brazilian cinema in his point of view 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.560
 or the Brazilian has everything to be one of the best in the field 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.659
 What is missing the Brazilian cinema is what we call medicado 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.620
 every day, more cinemas close 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.170
 they are becoming a supermarket churches 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.600
 are forgetting 'cultural resigned' of our people qs 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.689
 he is in need of these messages 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.300
 we made the watchman to supply this side 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.500
 and the cinema seems to me that it is now having a 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.080
 I'm glad the government is looking more towards this side I hope in. 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.970
 we had not enough time 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.450
 a true brazilian cinema thank you very much the words of carlos miranda a 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.289
 character that Brazil will not forget 

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:16.369
 a little while with you 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:18.339

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:21.329
