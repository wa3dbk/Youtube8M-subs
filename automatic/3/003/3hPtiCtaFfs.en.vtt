one<00:00:01.680> common<00:00:02.190> front<00:00:02.490> handspring<00:00:02.909> mistake<00:00:03.360> is

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
one common front handspring mistake is

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.510 
one common front handspring mistake is
allowing<00:00:04.140> the<00:00:04.230> body<00:00:04.380> to<00:00:04.560> lean<00:00:04.830> forward<00:00:04.859> past

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
allowing the body to lean forward past

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.970 
allowing the body to lean forward past
the<00:00:05.700> vertical<00:00:06.150> before<00:00:07.109> completing<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.740> arms

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
the vertical before completing the arms

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.959 
the vertical before completing the arms
repulsion<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:10.309> flying<00:00:11.309> face<00:00:11.639> does<00:00:11.940> not

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
repulsion the flying face does not

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.850 
repulsion the flying face does not
achieve<00:00:12.509> enough<00:00:12.809> height<00:00:13.049> for<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.380> good<00:00:13.620> body

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
achieve enough height for a good body

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.919 
achieve enough height for a good body
turnover<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:14.700> makes<00:00:15.120> it<00:00:15.269> difficult<00:00:15.480> to

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
turnover and makes it difficult to

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.859 
turnover and makes it difficult to
accomplish<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.440> powerful<00:00:16.980> rebound<00:00:20.720> this<00:00:21.720> is

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
accomplish a powerful rebound this is

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.660 
accomplish a powerful rebound this is
another<00:00:22.140> example<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.890> same<00:00:23.160> shoulders

common mistake to solve in front
handsprings<00:00:53.629> another<00:00:54.629> mistake<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.320> when<00:00:55.350> the

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
handsprings another mistake is when the

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.319 
handsprings another mistake is when the

to push off the floor harder bending the

elbows to push is the slower action that

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.910 
elbows to push is the slower action that
actually<00:01:04.019> causes<00:01:04.410> poor<00:01:04.800> flying<00:01:05.160> phases
