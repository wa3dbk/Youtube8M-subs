up<00:00:26.539> it's<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.750> nine<00:00:28.109> LEDs

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.110 

I<00:00:35.880> like<00:00:36.880> this<00:00:37.060> because<00:00:37.270> you<00:00:37.360> don't<00:00:37.570> have<00:00:37.780> to<00:00:38.020> I

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
I like this because you don't have to I

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.470 
I like this because you don't have to I
don't<00:00:40.120> have<00:00:40.210> to<00:00:40.300> use<00:00:40.420> acid<00:00:42.780> it's<00:00:43.780> just<00:00:44.080> uh

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
don't have to use acid it's just uh

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.740 
don't have to use acid it's just uh
let's<00:00:46.480> just<00:00:46.690> see<00:00:46.870> water<00:00:47.050> I<00:00:48.330> sanded<00:00:49.330> the<00:00:49.450> inside

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
let's just see water I sanded the inside

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.770 
let's just see water I sanded the inside
of<00:00:49.930> the<00:00:49.990> beer<00:00:50.170> cans<00:00:50.410> a<00:00:50.830> little<00:00:51.130> bit<00:00:51.280> and<00:00:51.780> those

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
of the beer cans a little bit and those

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.080 
of the beer cans a little bit and those
are<00:00:53.190> Kingsford<00:00:54.190> Charcoal<00:00:54.730> briquettes

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
are Kingsford Charcoal briquettes

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.560 
are Kingsford Charcoal briquettes
there's<00:00:55.300> three<00:00:55.540> briquettes<00:00:55.900> in<00:00:56.110> each<00:00:56.610> can<00:00:57.610> and

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
there's three briquettes in each can and

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.330 
there's three briquettes in each can and
I<00:00:59.170> kind<00:00:59.380> of<00:00:59.440> surrounded<00:00:59.890> them<00:01:00.010> with<00:01:00.100> a<00:01:00.130> paper

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
I kind of surrounded them with a paper

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.260 
I kind of surrounded them with a paper
towel<00:01:00.670> now<00:01:02.340> this<00:01:03.340> batter<00:01:03.550> didn't<00:01:03.970> need<00:01:04.059> to<00:01:04.089> be

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:04.270 
towel now this batter didn't need to be

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.080 
towel now this batter didn't need to be
charged<00:01:04.720> they<00:01:05.199> charged<00:01:05.620> it<00:01:05.800> for<00:01:06.040> about<00:01:06.280> a<00:01:06.610> half

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
charged they charged it for about a half

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.010 
charged they charged it for about a half
hour<00:01:07.210> and<00:01:07.510> 12<00:01:08.500> volts<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:10.450> I<00:01:10.630> think<00:01:10.810> that's

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
hour and 12 volts and I think that's

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:18.450 
hour and 12 volts and I think that's
pretty<00:01:11.229> cool<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:17.350> is<00:01:17.590> about<00:01:17.830> the<00:01:18.040> resting

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
pretty cool this is about the resting

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.140 
pretty cool this is about the resting
voltage<00:01:18.640> it's<00:01:19.300> uh<00:01:19.570> just<00:01:19.780> slightly<00:01:20.320> above<00:01:21.150> five

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
voltage it's uh just slightly above five

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.270 
voltage it's uh just slightly above five
so<00:01:22.540> it's<00:01:22.660> five<00:01:22.840> point<00:01:23.170> two<00:01:23.229> to<00:01:23.560> five<00:01:23.890> point<00:01:24.130> to

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
so it's five point two to five point to

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.130 
so it's five point two to five point to
three<00:01:25.770> which<00:01:26.770> is<00:01:26.800> perfect<00:01:27.369> for<00:01:27.400> this<00:01:27.640> little

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
three which is perfect for this little

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:36.200 
three which is perfect for this little
LED<00:01:29.140> because<00:01:29.259> it<00:01:29.470> runs<00:01:29.680> off<00:01:29.860> four<00:01:30.130> and<00:01:30.220> a<00:01:30.250> half

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.030 

anyway<00:01:36.930> that's<00:01:37.020> really<00:01:37.320> easy<00:01:37.410> to<00:01:37.530> make<00:01:37.770> you

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
anyway that's really easy to make you

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.310 
anyway that's really easy to make you
just<00:01:38.070> drill<00:01:38.520> each<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.910> briquettes<00:01:39.300> run<00:01:40.290> a

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
just drill each of the briquettes run a

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.530 
just drill each of the briquettes run a
copper<00:01:40.680> wire<00:01:40.860> through<00:01:41.130> it

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
copper wire through it

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.260 
copper wire through it
wrap<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.690> with<00:01:42.750> paper<00:01:43.050> towel<00:01:44.060> fill<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.120> with

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
wrap it with paper towel fill it with

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.490 
wrap it with paper towel fill it with
sea<00:01:45.780> water<00:01:46.940> and<00:01:47.940> then<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.480> positive<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.470> the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
sea water and then the positive to the

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.700 
sea water and then the positive to the
negative<00:01:49.590> positive<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.970> negative

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
negative positive to the negative

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.170 
negative positive to the negative
positive<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.220> negative<00:01:53.250> positive<00:01:53.760> comes

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
positive is a negative positive comes

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.520 
positive is a negative positive comes
out<00:01:55.010> can<00:01:56.010> light<00:01:56.190> an<00:01:56.340> LED<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:57.030> single<00:01:57.720> LED<00:01:58.080> easily

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
out can light an LED a single LED easily

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.729 
out can light an LED a single LED easily
off<00:01:58.740> each<00:01:59.190> of<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.460> cells
