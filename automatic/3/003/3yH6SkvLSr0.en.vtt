00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.099
 and oat milk now welcome a 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.820
 Wednesday more today I want to share with 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.590
 you how to make oat milk 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.390
 and uses oat milk to 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.119
 have breakfast with cereals or for 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.950
 make cookie cakes for what 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:22.759
 use normal milk but instead of 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.910
 normal milk 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:27.580
 we make oat milk 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.040
 Once, how is it made that is super easy and 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:34.570
 we want we are going to need flakes 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:37.330
 of oatmeal of course water and then salt 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.430
 so that it reinforces its flavor and if 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.699
 you want to give also more flavor you can 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.920
 put cinnamon you can put sweetener 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:46.690
 for example sugar or I use instead of 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.150
 agave syrup and then we're going to 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.390
 need a blender or a hand glass 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:55.900
 what you have closer to what 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.670
 you use and two colanders one greater and another 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.879
 smaller or a container where 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.450
 put the oatmeal to soak and a glass or 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.450
 a cup 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.899
 [Music] 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.750
 and you are also going to need a container 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:14.369
 where we approach our milk once 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.649
 made if you see that the mouth of the container 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.270
 is very close you also need a 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:19.619
 funnel 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.920
 we begin by soaking oats 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.320
 I'm going to put two glasses of oatmeal and the 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.509
 we leave there submerged in the water during 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.080
 half an hour elapsed that time with 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.080
 the island water 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.710
 [Music] 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.300
 you put the soaked oat flakes 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.710
 in the blender or in the American glass 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.409
 [Music] 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.290
 and now add twice as much water as 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.880
 I have put two glasses of oatmeal 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.850
 of oatmeal flakes so now I'm going to 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.880
 add four glasses of water now you 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:56.060
 you add as a teaspoon and a half 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.430
 dessert one teaspoon 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.210
 and if you want to add other things like 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:04.260
 cinnamon sugar or agave syrup 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.460
 it is added now 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.530
 we cover 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.920
 and we beat it we do not want us to stay 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:15.540
 too much beaten but yes that the 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.540
 juice from inside the oat flakes 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:22.100
 crazy lies in the container for then 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.100
 pass it through the small colander 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.450
 [Music] 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.060
 helps us from the spoon to 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.570
 press it so that all the 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.570
 liquid 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.710
 [Music] 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:45.960
 place the strainer over the jar 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:47.700
 you have jugs but somewhere else 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.950
 and now let's move it to where 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.250
 we want to save and we paste what we 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.250
 remains 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.240
 We move it with the spoon until it 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.240
 leave all the liquid 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.630
 and you are ready 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.630
 for lota pÃ¡is 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.330
 and when you store it in the fridge and 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.939
 when you want to use just what 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.189
 you have to move a bit because it 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:17.430
 will gather the whole well here but from this 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:19.689
 It is normal as you can see and you can use it 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.700
 look like this is how it stays when 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:23.769
 you leave to rest the refrigerator stays 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.129
 here as the well and this nothing does not 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.129
 mix 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.760
 moving it this way energetically and already 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.799
 you have ready 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.870
 and with quotas left over from the summer 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.879
 you can use them for the 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.099
 breakfast mixed with cereals or 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:44.569
 simply with milk or even years 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:48.939
 you can use to make other 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:51.170
 recipes and here you have the final result 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:52.909
 As always, the ingredients 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.150
 I leave in the information box and in my 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:57.620
 blog I used to always buy milk 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.819
 of oats but since I discovered that it 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.310
 You can do it in such an easy way 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:03.890
 fast and economical now I always do it 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.480
 at home when I want to make milk 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.010
 oatmeal I want to have for breakfast 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.170
 for the previous night he prepared us 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.359
 He left the fridge then moves a little bit already 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.359
 you know so that the 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:17.150
 ingredients and ready if you are going to take it 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:18.859
 just like milk a glass of milk put 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.720
 something more because I only with saleh not 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.000
 It has a lot of flavor but yes already if 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.370
 You put cinnamon and think it with sweet 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.740
 then you know much better advice 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.750
 the vall always in colander the blender 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.180
 what you are using so that you 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.220
 it will be much easier if you leave it 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.539
 then it stays there stuck all hard and 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.639
 dry and it is horrible 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:40.540
 so wash it in the moment and you see 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:42.760
 that they do nothing and nothing is there 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.310
 even wash things how they are used 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.160
 Four things assembled, do not delay 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.800
 back I hope you liked that what 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.510
 do and nothing to say if you want 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.460
 it seems to you we'll see you next 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.460
