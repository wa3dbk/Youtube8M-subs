00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:16.040
 he's, I thought you you say times 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:28.509
 the chest there too but rather manuel the 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:34.850
 boss is also there hello my mother 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:37.550
 we make photos ugly 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:41.510
 okay, maybe we all get it 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.670
 have it strong server that is offline 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:48.020
 and he'll stay that way for now 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:52.460
 offline but season 2000 planning i 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:54.680
 I'm only in high gear shot 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.140
 raussuchen so not packed and 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.220
 who can play well 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:06.200
 and yes the man is now holding again 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:08.770
 flew out of it or just tell it 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.690
 how did it happen, why and where 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.180
 subsequent reason the server only 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.430
 exploded and somehow then 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.590
 when we animated the server 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.090
 when taking away from the whitelist 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:31.560
 and that's why I could not do more 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:34.159
 play along ok yes if you have us 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:39.259
 the first season like that 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:41.689
 I can do the mountains from actual age though 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.359
 Nice but I swear you near by 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:45.859
 to get from a to b 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:47.179
 Rust old from a billion follow 

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:50.840
 or so or a year 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:53.119
 this always has this distance 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.640
 bridge has fucked me because it 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:02:04.400
 was too much away 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:05.900
 why not even sure is yes 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:13.100
 not amplified then but if 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:14.900
 him a new beautiful normal world and 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.400
 we noticed people need that 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.770
 licks i think so about 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.450
 the most blatant machine that the trave 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.220
 had to offer and it still has 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.450
 placed 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.890
 for the mother of demi trio 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.950
 Managing Director was on this machine 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:36.459
 day in and day out and checked the leaf 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.459
 the hamsterrad busy this age 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.200
 who was born 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.640
 you are definitely in the second 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.350
 Season with you have something 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.690
 made for the second season 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.510
 somehow revue more often or less 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.540
 or more laughter so more laughter is 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.620
 Definitely very important, I want it 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.160
 that my mother wants to project 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.250
 bring 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:02.780
 yes you can suggest yes because I 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:09.180
 beat the finished one that was honest me 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:11.870
 asked do you want to play with me force 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:19.459

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.810
 yes okay as we can with the times 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.379
 talking to other people about it stops 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.269
 every case 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:30.620
 i want to troll more yes more people 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.709
 to despair 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.940
 yes and handle it this time so that 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.670
 server does not explode and opinions 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.349
 is deleted from the white list 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:43.370
 I hope it is then in is 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:44.810
 all people that have no hello hello 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.980

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:53.150
 sometimes yes but without him okay of course 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:55.910
 without him I like that so well 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.390
 would like to say something to the people 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:03.319
 that you will vigorously follow in the future 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:05.329
 to see on a new map with yes 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:08.090
 not necessarily new people old 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:08.510
 People are not there anymore 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.280
 all 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.690
 yes we do that namely this time 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.150
 small but that was too much 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.389
 that was too many people at it 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.829
 were too many people have easy 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.700
 really too many people became one 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.630
 everywhere only people is microsoft project 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:27.919
 purchasing power and not anymore and now 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:30.169
 That's why I 'm glad I'm happy 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:32.210
 me even more on vigorous 2 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:35.650
 So, when I was one strong 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:38.720
 that's all I'm happy about 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:41.000
 I have to admit at that time than we did 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.470
 force staeck once planned what 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.070
 Maybe only a few people know that 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:49.250
 project originally came from malte 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:51.199

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:55.210

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.949
 exactly 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:02.270
 Manuel was ill, I remember back then 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:04.760
 when we started to plan 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.690
 one or two times my pants 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.919

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.750
 This time it will definitely be cool and me 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:14.479
