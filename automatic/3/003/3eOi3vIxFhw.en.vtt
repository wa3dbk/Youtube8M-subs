hey guys I'm due to the screw and I'm
making<00:00:04.770> a<00:00:04.830> tutorial<00:00:04.980> on<00:00:05.310> how<00:00:05.400> to<00:00:05.520> make<00:00:05.790> the

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
making a tutorial on how to make the

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.690 
making a tutorial on how to make the
mystery<00:00:06.330> box<00:00:06.509> on<00:00:06.720> black<00:00:07.020> ops<00:00:07.230> 2<00:00:07.649> black<00:00:08.069> ops<00:00:08.340> and

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
mystery box on black ops 2 black ops and

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.850 
mystery box on black ops 2 black ops and
just<00:00:09.660> normal<00:00:10.080> world<00:00:10.410> at<00:00:10.530> war<00:00:10.769> zombies<00:00:12.860> it's

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
just normal world at war zombies it's

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.820 
just normal world at war zombies it's
pretty<00:00:14.250> simple<00:00:14.670> I<00:00:15.320> mean<00:00:16.320> this<00:00:16.590> looks

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
pretty simple I mean this looks

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.410 
pretty simple I mean this looks
complicated<00:00:17.130> that's<00:00:17.940> just<00:00:18.119> because<00:00:18.210> I've

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
complicated that's just because I've

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.420 
complicated that's just because I've
compact<00:00:19.020> arised<00:00:19.410> it<00:00:19.740> from<00:00:20.520> this<00:00:21.740> to<00:00:22.740> this<00:00:22.769> to

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
compact arised it from this to this to

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.200 
compact arised it from this to this to
this<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.630> this<00:00:25.640> this<00:00:26.640> is<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.910> smallest

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
this to this this is the smallest

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.970 
this to this this is the smallest
version<00:00:27.449> I<00:00:27.660> could<00:00:27.840> come<00:00:28.019> up<00:00:28.140> with<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:30.500> it's<00:00:31.500> 3

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
version I could come up with and it's 3

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.020 
version I could come up with and it's 3
by<00:00:32.250> 7<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:33.739> as<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:34.860> can<00:00:35.010> see<00:00:35.040> can<00:00:35.460> conceal<00:00:35.880> it

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
by 7 and as you can see can conceal it

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.299 
by 7 and as you can see can conceal it
behind<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.600> wall<00:00:37.200> all<00:00:37.559> this<00:00:37.739> redstone<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:40.309> yeah

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
behind a wall all this redstone and yeah

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.549 
behind a wall all this redstone and yeah
so<00:00:42.120> I'm<00:00:42.239> going<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.420> show<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:42.660> how<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.230> build

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
so I'm going to show you how to build

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:52.279 
so I'm going to show you how to build
one<00:00:48.770> so<00:00:49.770> you're<00:00:49.920> going<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.129> need<00:00:50.399> all<00:00:51.140> of<00:00:52.140> this

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
one so you're going to need all of this

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.880 
one so you're going to need all of this
stuff<00:00:55.699> and<00:00:56.699> what<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.030> want<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.270> do<00:00:57.559> is<00:00:58.559> make

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
stuff and what you want to do is make

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.160 
stuff and what you want to do is make
your<00:00:59.100> box<00:00:59.460> so<00:00:59.789> it<00:00:59.850> could<00:01:00.030> be<00:01:00.059> made<00:01:00.660> out<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.870> any

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
your box so it could be made out of any

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.460 
your box so it could be made out of any
materials<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:01.980> just<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.340> three-way<00:01:02.879> one<00:01:03.170> on<00:01:04.170> by

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
materials so just a three-way one on by

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.929 
materials so just a three-way one on by
three<00:01:04.739> whatever<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.280> want<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.549> call<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.729> n

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
three whatever you want to call it n

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.270 
three whatever you want to call it n
it's<00:01:06.540> important<00:01:06.990> for<00:01:07.530> this<00:01:07.710> one<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.220> you

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
it's important for this one that you

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.510 
it's important for this one that you
need<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.850> put<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.540> button<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.140> middle<00:01:10.520> it

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
need to put the button in the middle it

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.160 
need to put the button in the middle it
was<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.820> won't<00:01:12.000> work<00:01:12.180> i<00:01:12.420> do<00:01:12.479> not<00:01:12.780> know<00:01:12.930> why<00:01:13.110> this

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
was it won't work i do not know why this

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.960 
was it won't work i do not know why this
is<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.710> can't<00:01:13.920> have<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.100> there<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.460> cannot

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
is so you can't have it there you cannot

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.570 
is so you can't have it there you cannot
have<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.299> there<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.659> can't<00:01:16.650> but<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.280> can<00:01:17.400> only

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
have it there you can't but you can only

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.880 
have it there you can't but you can only
have<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:17.970> there<00:01:19.070> so<00:01:21.170> next<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.470> want<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.710> make<00:01:22.860> a

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
have it there so next you want to make a

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:30.069 
have it there so next you want to make a
thing<00:01:23.250> like<00:01:23.700> this<00:01:23.780> and<00:01:25.729> around<00:01:26.729> like<00:01:27.420> this

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:33.109 

then<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.200> want<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.500> put<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.369> redstone<00:01:32.640> like

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
then you want to put a redstone like

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.789 
then you want to put a redstone like
this<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:34.729> have<00:01:36.020> got<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.110> remember<00:01:37.320> how<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.680> do

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
this and have got to remember how to do

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.240 
this and have got to remember how to do
it

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.990 

we<00:01:41.880> have<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.330> go<00:01:42.630> like<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:44.000> redstone

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
we have to go like this redstone

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.330 
we have to go like this redstone
comparator<00:01:45.410> kappa<00:01:46.410> rato<00:01:47.450> what<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.570> it

worth put a block there not glass that

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.070 
worth put a block there not glass that
would<00:01:56.940> be<00:01:57.060> very<00:01:57.090> bad<00:02:00.290> then<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.380> want<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.619> get

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
would be very bad then you want to get

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.250 
would be very bad then you want to get
do<00:02:04.080> blocks<00:02:04.410> like<00:02:04.650> this<00:02:05.780> put<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.840> redstone<00:02:07.050> torch

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
do blocks like this put a redstone torch

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.150 
do blocks like this put a redstone torch
here<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:08.100> bit<00:02:08.520> of<00:02:08.550> redstone<00:02:08.940> there<00:02:10.070> then<00:02:11.070> you

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
here a bit of redstone there then you

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.479 
here a bit of redstone there then you
want<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.340> get<00:02:11.459> your<00:02:11.580> command<00:02:12.120> block<00:02:12.540> in<00:02:13.489> the

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
want to get your command block in the

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:21.530 
want to get your command block in the
command<00:02:18.709> just<00:02:19.709> can<00:02:19.950> controlling<00:02:20.910> that<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.300> I

command just can controlling that and I

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.750 
command just can controlling that and I
will<00:02:23.540> explain<00:02:24.540> it<00:02:24.810> so<00:02:25.410> test<00:02:25.920> for<00:02:26.250> is<00:02:26.430> just<00:02:26.610> to

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
will explain it so test for is just to

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.530 
will explain it so test for is just to
make<00:02:27.690> sure<00:02:27.720> you<00:02:28.170> have<00:02:28.440> got<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:29.540> levels

make sure you have got the levels

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.370 
make sure you have got the levels
necessary<00:02:31.380> for<00:02:31.709> purchase<00:02:32.550> at<00:02:33.000> P<00:02:33.720> is<00:02:34.020> just

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
necessary for purchase at P is just

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.960 
necessary for purchase at P is just
that'll<00:02:34.739> take<00:02:34.950> at<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.250> nearest<00:02:35.489> player<00:02:35.790> to

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
that'll take at the nearest player to

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.520 
that'll take at the nearest player to
the<00:02:36.090> box<00:02:36.330> so<00:02:36.570> make<00:02:36.750> sure<00:02:36.780> you're<00:02:37.080> close<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.290> the

the box so make sure you're close to the

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.800 
the box so make sure you're close to the
books<00:02:37.770> when<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:38.760> do<00:02:38.940> it<00:02:39.120> when<00:02:39.510> you're<00:02:39.630> playing

now<00:03:56.280> we're<00:03:56.430> just<00:03:56.460> caught<00:03:56.850> copying<00:03:57.300> that<00:03:57.720> and

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:07.400 

so<00:04:01.680> XP<00:04:03.740> that's<00:04:04.740> like<00:04:05.180> XP<00:04:06.180> commands<00:04:06.870> you<00:04:07.140> just

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
so XP that's like XP commands you just

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.110 
so XP that's like XP commands you just
do<00:04:08.220> it<00:04:08.280> with<00:04:09.060> XP<00:04:09.510> and<00:04:09.930> then<00:04:10.260> you<00:04:10.350> want<00:04:10.530> to<00:04:10.590> go

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
do it with XP and then you want to go

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:18.250 
do it with XP and then you want to go
minus<00:04:12.120> or<00:04:12.480> dash<00:04:13.410> sign<00:04:15.170> minus<00:04:16.170> five<00:04:16.950> levels<00:04:17.489> or

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
minus or dash sign minus five levels or

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.380 
minus or dash sign minus five levels or
basically<00:04:19.260> what<00:04:19.590> you<00:04:19.709> put<00:04:19.980> the<00:04:20.970> number<00:04:21.239> you

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
basically what you put the number you

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:31.820 
basically what you put the number you
put<00:04:21.570> here<00:04:23.090> make<00:04:24.090> it<00:04:24.270> the<00:04:24.420> same<00:04:26.120> WTF<00:04:29.450> here<00:04:30.830> so

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
put here make it the same WTF here so

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.760 
put here make it the same WTF here so
make<00:04:32.070> it<00:04:32.100> five<00:04:32.550> if<00:04:32.910> you<00:04:33.870> made<00:04:34.080> it<00:04:34.110> twenty<00:04:34.560> make

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
make it five if you made it twenty make

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.370 
make it five if you made it twenty make
it<00:04:34.890> twenty<00:04:35.280> if<00:04:36.030> you<00:04:36.240> made<00:04:36.390> a<00:04:36.420> million<00:04:36.900> making<00:04:37.320> a

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
it twenty if you made a million making a

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.500 
it twenty if you made a million making a
million<00:04:39.710> but<00:04:40.710> because<00:04:41.010> mine's<00:04:41.220> 500<00:04:41.940> 45<00:04:42.270> then

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
million but because mine's 500 45 then

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.720 
million but because mine's 500 45 then
at<00:04:42.720> P<00:04:43.020> to<00:04:43.200> target<00:04:43.590> newest<00:04:43.800> player<00:04:44.070> so<00:04:44.580> this

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
at P to target newest player so this

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.410 
at P to target newest player so this
takes<00:04:45.000> off<00:04:45.270> the<00:04:45.510> levels<00:04:46.580> then<00:04:47.580> in<00:04:47.730> brackets<00:04:47.910> L

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
takes off the levels then in brackets L

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.770 
takes off the levels then in brackets L
M<00:04:48.690> equals<00:04:49.560> five<00:04:49.980> and<00:04:50.370> that's<00:04:51.360> the<00:04:51.540> same<00:04:51.750> as

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
M equals five and that's the same as

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.630 
M equals five and that's the same as
this<00:04:53.540> so<00:04:54.540> next<00:04:54.720> all<00:04:55.650> you've<00:04:56.010> got<00:04:56.130> to<00:04:56.160> do<00:04:56.370> is<00:04:56.460> do

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
this so next all you've got to do is do

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.430 
this so next all you've got to do is do
the<00:04:56.670> bossing<00:04:57.270> which<00:04:57.900> is<00:04:58.050> a<00:04:58.080> bit<00:04:58.320> complicated

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
the bossing which is a bit complicated

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.420 
the bossing which is a bit complicated
here<00:04:59.070> as<00:04:59.130> you<00:04:59.250> can<00:04:59.280> see<00:05:00.919> took<00:05:01.919> a<00:05:01.950> while<00:05:02.190> for<00:05:02.220> me

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
here as you can see took a while for me

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.540 
here as you can see took a while for me
to<00:05:02.580> figure<00:05:02.790> out<00:05:03.890> I'm<00:05:04.890> not<00:05:05.220> the<00:05:05.340> greatest

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
to figure out I'm not the greatest

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:12.550 
to figure out I'm not the greatest
redstone<00:05:06.060> over<00:05:06.380> oops

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.270 

then<00:05:13.560> you<00:05:13.650> will<00:05:13.710> put<00:05:13.770> another<00:05:14.070> torch<00:05:14.400> up<00:05:14.580> here

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
then you will put another torch up here

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.529 
then you will put another torch up here
and<00:05:17.280> hook<00:05:17.460> this<00:05:17.669> up<00:05:17.729> to<00:05:17.910> a<00:05:18.120> dispenser<00:05:19.460> there<00:05:20.539> or

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:21.539 
and hook this up to a dispenser there or

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:24.740 
and hook this up to a dispenser there or
actually<00:05:21.990> no<00:05:22.280> put<00:05:23.280> it<00:05:23.400> there<00:05:24.240> that<00:05:24.479> would<00:05:24.630> be

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
actually no put it there that would be

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.650 
actually no put it there that would be
better<00:05:26.539> so<00:05:27.539> now<00:05:27.660> it's<00:05:27.840> basically<00:05:28.229> done

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
better so now it's basically done

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.120 
better so now it's basically done
