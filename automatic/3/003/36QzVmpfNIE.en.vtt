into town we get gas and to get an oil

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.120 
into town we get gas and to get an oil
change<00:01:54.530> I'm<00:01:55.530> going<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.800> flip<00:01:55.980> these

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
change I'm going to flip these

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.600 
change I'm going to flip these
headlights<00:01:56.640> up<00:01:56.880> so<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.180> can<00:01:57.330> see

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.370 

it<00:02:01.150> flips<00:02:02.100> on<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.790> driver's<00:02:04.360> side<00:02:04.390> but<00:02:05.140> not<00:02:05.320> on

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
it flips on the driver's side but not on

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.050 
it flips on the driver's side but not on
the<00:02:05.590> passenger<00:02:06.160> side<00:02:06.340> I<00:02:06.400> believe<00:02:06.790> that

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
the passenger side I believe that

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.820 
the passenger side I believe that
passenger<00:02:07.630> side<00:02:07.870> is<00:02:08.080> locked<00:02:08.350> in<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.679> up

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
passenger side is locked in the up

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.410 
passenger side is locked in the up
position<00:02:09.009> because<00:02:09.520> it<00:02:09.670> doesn't<00:02:10.030> flip<00:02:10.210> all<00:02:10.390> the

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
position because it doesn't flip all the

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.330 
position because it doesn't flip all the
way<00:02:10.509> you<00:02:11.140> see<00:02:11.350> I<00:02:11.380> flipped<00:02:11.650> it<00:02:11.770> back<00:02:11.890> on<00:02:12.160> it

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
way you see I flipped it back on it

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.060 
way you see I flipped it back on it
doesn't<00:02:12.640> come<00:02:12.760> all<00:02:12.880> the<00:02:13.000> way<00:02:13.030> back<00:02:13.770> and<00:02:14.770> push

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
doesn't come all the way back and push

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.590 
doesn't come all the way back and push
it<00:02:15.310> and<00:02:15.430> I<00:02:15.520> think<00:02:15.730> it<00:02:15.820> stays<00:02:16.060> there<00:02:16.240> so<00:02:16.420> it<00:02:16.570> just

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
it and I think it stays there so it just

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.590 
it and I think it stays there so it just
needs<00:02:16.810> a<00:02:17.110> gear<00:02:17.530> in<00:02:18.160> that<00:02:18.700> motor<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.150> motor<00:02:19.180> is

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
needs a gear in that motor the motor is

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.720 
needs a gear in that motor the motor is
operating<00:02:20.230> so<00:02:20.320> the<00:02:20.410> motors<00:02:20.680> locked<00:02:20.890> up<00:02:21.160> they

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
operating so the motors locked up they

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.790 
operating so the motors locked up they
have<00:02:21.850> that<00:02:22.030> del<00:02:22.240> run<00:02:22.480> Delrin<00:02:23.110> gear<00:02:23.380> that<00:02:23.620> needs

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
have that del run Delrin gear that needs

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.460 
have that del run Delrin gear that needs
to<00:02:23.920> be<00:02:23.950> replaced<00:02:24.660> let's<00:02:25.660> like<00:02:25.780> get<00:02:25.960> a<00:02:26.020> bulb<00:02:26.320> out

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
to be replaced let's like get a bulb out

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.710 
to be replaced let's like get a bulb out
in<00:02:26.650> here<00:02:26.800> in<00:02:26.920> the<00:02:27.010> front<00:02:27.340> that<00:02:28.300> one<00:02:28.540> works<00:02:30.720> but

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
in here in the front that one works but

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.880

it<00:04:57.090> a<00:04:57.150> super<00:04:57.420> nice<00:04:57.570> car<00:04:57.870> the<00:04:58.020> whole<00:04:58.110> car<00:04:58.380> would

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
it a super nice car the whole car would

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.290 
it a super nice car the whole car would
need<00:04:58.650> to<00:04:58.740> be<00:04:58.800> painted<00:04:59.040> you<00:04:59.880> just<00:05:00.060> wanted<00:05:00.270> to

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
need to be painted you just wanted to

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.020 
need to be painted you just wanted to
make<00:05:00.450> a<00:05:00.480> decent<00:05:00.720> driver<00:05:01.490> not<00:05:02.490> have<00:05:02.670> much<00:05:02.820> money

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
make a decent driver not have much money

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.610 
make a decent driver not have much money
in<00:05:03.270> it<00:05:03.390> the<00:05:03.480> paint<00:05:03.690> job<00:05:03.870> doesn't<00:05:04.200> look<00:05:04.290> too<00:05:04.440> bad

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
in it the paint job doesn't look too bad

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.040 
in it the paint job doesn't look too bad
on<00:05:04.680> it<00:05:06.110> there<00:05:07.110> is<00:05:07.140> a<00:05:07.380> scratch<00:05:07.950> right<00:05:08.280> there<00:05:08.340> a

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
on it there is a scratch right there a

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.420 
on it there is a scratch right there a
couple<00:05:10.050> chips<00:05:10.320> and<00:05:10.680> then<00:05:10.770> a<00:05:10.860> scratch<00:05:11.130> it<00:05:11.310> goes

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
couple chips and then a scratch it goes

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.430 
couple chips and then a scratch it goes
back<00:05:11.640> onto<00:05:11.850> the<00:05:12.000> quarter<00:05:12.300> panel<00:05:12.660> I<00:05:12.840> think

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
back onto the quarter panel I think

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.990 
back onto the quarter panel I think
that's<00:05:13.620> probably<00:05:13.770> the<00:05:14.010> worst<00:05:14.250> place<00:05:14.550> on<00:05:14.850> the

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
that's probably the worst place on the

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.200 
that's probably the worst place on the
body<00:05:18.980> looks<00:05:19.980> like<00:05:20.040> there's<00:05:20.340> a<00:05:20.430> little<00:05:20.700> rough

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
body looks like there's a little rough

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.360 
body looks like there's a little rough
you<00:05:21.360> see<00:05:21.660> a<00:05:21.930> little<00:05:22.530> bit<00:05:22.710> of<00:05:22.800> a<00:05:22.860> chip<00:05:23.130> right

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
you see a little bit of a chip right

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.590 
you see a little bit of a chip right
here<00:05:23.720> and<00:05:24.720> right<00:05:25.470> here<00:05:25.500> and<00:05:25.980> then<00:05:26.880> also<00:05:27.090> it

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
here and right here and then also it

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.670 
here and right here and then also it
looks<00:05:27.720> like<00:05:27.840> you<00:05:27.930> put<00:05:28.080> a<00:05:28.140> screw<00:05:28.410> in<00:05:28.440> there

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
looks like you put a screw in there

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.080 
looks like you put a screw in there
maybe<00:05:28.890> to<00:05:29.040> hold<00:05:29.190> that<00:05:29.310> tight<00:05:29.580> or<00:05:29.760> something

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
maybe to hold that tight or something

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.379 
maybe to hold that tight or something
I'm<00:05:30.180> not<00:05:30.300> sure

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:33.389 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:35.240 

but<00:05:33.930> everything's<00:05:34.259> like<00:05:34.710> it<00:05:34.860> fits<00:05:35.069> pretty

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
but everything's like it fits pretty

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:41.510 
but everything's like it fits pretty
good<00:05:35.900> there's<00:05:36.900> another<00:05:37.110> scratch<00:05:40.220> some<00:05:41.220> chips

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
good there's another scratch some chips

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.189 
good there's another scratch some chips
on<00:05:41.729> the<00:05:41.819> edge<00:05:41.969> of<00:05:42.180> the<00:05:42.240> door<00:05:42.449> but<00:05:42.870> nothing

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 
on the edge of the door but nothing

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:47.869 
on the edge of the door but nothing
major<00:05:46.039> yeah<00:05:47.039> I<00:05:47.069> mean<00:05:47.280> if<00:05:47.370> you<00:05:47.430> just<00:05:47.610> wanted<00:05:47.849> a

00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:47.879 
major yeah I mean if you just wanted a

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:50.719 
major yeah I mean if you just wanted a
good<00:05:48.030> daily<00:05:48.210> driver<00:05:48.599> put<00:05:48.900> some<00:05:49.050> tires<00:05:49.319> on<00:05:49.650> it

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
good daily driver put some tires on it

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:55.700 
good daily driver put some tires on it
tune-up<00:05:51.479> fix<00:05:51.870> that<00:05:52.020> all<00:05:52.139> week<00:05:52.469> and<00:05:54.710> they're

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
tune-up fix that all week and they're

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:02.959 
tune-up fix that all week and they're
not<00:05:55.860> oil<00:05:56.099> leak<00:05:56.370> but<00:06:00.680> antifreeze<00:06:01.680> leak<00:06:01.979> it

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:02.969 
not oil leak but antifreeze leak it

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:04.129 
not oil leak but antifreeze leak it
looks<00:06:03.180> like<00:06:03.360> it<00:06:03.449> does<00:06:03.599> have<00:06:03.750> a<00:06:03.780> little<00:06:04.020> bit<00:06:04.110> of

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:04.139 
looks like it does have a little bit of

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:05.510 
looks like it does have a little bit of
antifreeze<00:06:04.590> leak<00:06:04.830> I<00:06:04.979> can<00:06:05.129> see<00:06:05.310> there

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
antifreeze leak I can see there

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.189 
antifreeze leak I can see there
underneath<00:06:05.909> it<00:06:06.060> and<00:06:06.180> probably<00:06:06.330> a<00:06:06.509> front

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:07.199 
underneath it and probably a front

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:08.990 
underneath it and probably a front
radiator<00:06:07.409> hose<00:06:07.919> I'm<00:06:08.250> pretty<00:06:08.520> sure<00:06:08.669> with<00:06:08.849> what

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
radiator hose I'm pretty sure with what

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.159 
radiator hose I'm pretty sure with what
was<00:06:09.150> leaking<00:06:09.479> on<00:06:09.599> it<00:06:11.629> exhaust<00:06:12.629> leak<00:06:12.900> was<00:06:13.050> what

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:13.169 
was leaking on it exhaust leak was what

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:14.390 
was leaking on it exhaust leak was what
I<00:06:13.199> was<00:06:13.319> thinking<00:06:13.620> a<00:06:13.680> second<00:06:13.949> ago

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 
I was thinking a second ago

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.580 
I was thinking a second ago
I<00:06:14.430> think<00:06:15.150> I<00:06:15.180> fixed<00:06:15.389> the<00:06:15.569> exhaust<00:06:15.900> leak<00:06:16.199> and<00:06:16.379> the

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:16.590 
I think I fixed the exhaust leak and the

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.700 
I think I fixed the exhaust leak and the
put<00:06:16.949> a<00:06:16.979> lower<00:06:17.159> radiator<00:06:17.580> hose<00:06:17.699> on<00:06:18.060> it<00:06:18.680> take<00:06:19.680> a

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710 
put a lower radiator hose on it take a

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.749 
put a lower radiator hose on it take a
break<00:06:20.009> do<00:06:20.430> it<00:06:20.520> real<00:06:20.729> it<00:06:21.629> is<00:06:21.840> pretty<00:06:22.110> thoroughly

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:22.759 
break do it real it is pretty thoroughly

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:25.100 
break do it real it is pretty thoroughly
maybe<00:06:23.759> put<00:06:23.940> a<00:06:23.969> couple<00:06:24.030> two<00:06:24.330> covers<00:06:24.659> on<00:06:24.810> it<00:06:24.960> it'd

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
maybe put a couple two covers on it it'd

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.769 
maybe put a couple two covers on it it'd
be<00:06:25.229> a<00:06:25.259> pretty<00:06:25.440> decent<00:06:25.590> daily<00:06:26.069> driver<00:06:26.659> it's<00:06:27.659> not

00:06:27.769 --> 00:06:27.779 
be a pretty decent daily driver it's not

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:29.450 
be a pretty decent daily driver it's not
a<00:06:27.810> super<00:06:28.080> fast<00:06:28.319> star<00:06:28.620> so<00:06:28.830> it'd<00:06:28.919> be<00:06:28.949> good<00:06:29.190> for<00:06:29.430> a

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 
a super fast star so it'd be good for a

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.409 
a super fast star so it'd be good for a
teenager<00:06:29.849> have<00:06:30.810> a<00:06:30.840> cool<00:06:31.169> car<00:06:32.090> they<00:06:33.090> probably

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:33.419 
teenager have a cool car they probably

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:36.260 
teenager have a cool car they probably
spend<00:06:33.810> $500<00:06:34.620> on<00:06:34.770> it<00:06:34.830> and<00:06:35.069> make<00:06:35.189> a<00:06:35.219> big<00:06:36.090> pretty

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.270 
spend $500 on it and make a big pretty

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.680 
spend $500 on it and make a big pretty
nice<00:06:36.449> car<00:06:36.689> out<00:06:36.870> of<00:06:36.900> it<00:06:37.050> there<00:06:37.500> you<00:06:37.590> go
