satellite it's a term you don't hear
quite<00:00:08.880> as<00:00:08.970> often<00:00:09.150> now<00:00:09.450> that<00:00:09.620> pcs<00:00:10.620> or<00:00:10.889> Macs<00:00:11.130> can

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
quite as often now that pcs or Macs can

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.950 
quite as often now that pcs or Macs can
do<00:00:11.610> things<00:00:11.880> that<00:00:12.150> used<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.480> require<00:00:12.719> a

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
do things that used to require a

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.709 
do things that used to require a
mainframe<00:00:13.469> but<00:00:14.040> anyway<00:00:14.400> mainframes<00:00:15.269> are<00:00:15.450> big

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
mainframe but anyway mainframes are big

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.630 
mainframe but anyway mainframes are big
and<00:00:15.900> complex<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:16.560> expensive<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:17.310> that's<00:00:17.460> the

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
and complex and expensive and that's the

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.310 
and complex and expensive and that's the
basis<00:00:18.000> of<00:00:18.119> this<00:00:18.300> song<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.690> this<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.140> one

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
basis of this song and this is the one

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.890 
basis of this song and this is the one
that<00:00:19.760> that<00:00:20.760> kind<00:00:21.000> of<00:00:21.060> reminds<00:00:21.420> me<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.570> one

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
that that kind of reminds me of one

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.019 
that that kind of reminds me of one
piece<00:00:22.140> at<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.410> time<00:00:22.439> by<00:00:22.890> Johnny<00:00:23.160> Cash<00:00:23.279> which<00:00:23.850> we
