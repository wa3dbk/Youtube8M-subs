00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:39.390 
obviously did so basically the bag is
like<00:04:37.870> a<00:04:37.900> big<00:04:38.169> sort<00:04:38.409> of<00:04:38.469> chocolate<00:04:38.889> bag<00:04:39.099> at

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
like a big sort of chocolate bag at

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.499 
like a big sort of chocolate bag at
Latorre<00:04:39.849> is<00:04:40.439> just<00:04:41.439> a<00:04:41.560> big<00:04:41.800> open<00:04:42.250> bucket<00:04:42.909> and

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:43.509 
Latorre is just a big open bucket and

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:44.939 
Latorre is just a big open bucket and
you<00:04:43.629> just<00:04:43.900> chuck<00:04:44.169> anything<00:04:44.560> in<00:04:44.680> which<00:04:44.800> is

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:44.949 
you just chuck anything in which is

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:46.140 
you just chuck anything in which is
really<00:04:45.189> really<00:04:45.310> good<00:04:45.550> in<00:04:45.729> handy<00:04:46.060> because

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
really really good in handy because

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.879 
really really good in handy because
there's<00:04:46.689> actually<00:04:46.840> it<00:04:47.259> can<00:04:47.409> fit<00:04:47.620> a<00:04:47.650> lot<00:04:47.860> in

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:49.589 
there's actually it can fit a lot in
here<00:04:48.250> because<00:04:48.430> it's<00:04:48.699> not<00:04:48.789> like<00:04:49.090> a<00:04:49.150> structured

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:49.599 
here because it's not like a structured

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:51.540 
here because it's not like a structured
bag<00:04:49.780> it's<00:04:50.110> flexible<00:04:50.770> you<00:04:50.949> can<00:04:51.009> squeeze

said if there's really not a lot to the

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.559 
said if there's really not a lot to the
bag<00:05:28.840> it<00:05:29.229> is<00:05:29.289> just<00:05:30.099> a<00:05:30.159> big<00:05:30.340> open<00:05:30.610> space<00:05:31.060> little

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:31.569 
bag it is just a big open space little

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:33.959 
bag it is just a big open space little
side<00:05:31.779> pocket<00:05:32.319> it<00:05:32.500> has<00:05:32.680> the<00:05:32.919> leather<00:05:33.099> flap<00:05:33.639> and

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:33.969 
side pocket it has the leather flap and

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:36.480 
side pocket it has the leather flap and
it's<00:05:34.240> got<00:05:34.539> two<00:05:34.870> straps<00:05:35.199> which<00:05:36.009> they're<00:05:36.339> not

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
it's got two straps which they're not

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.189 
it's got two straps which they're not
leather<00:05:36.729> straps<00:05:37.150> which<00:05:37.719> I<00:05:37.839> think<00:05:38.020> actually

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:38.199 
leather straps which I think actually

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:39.779 
leather straps which I think actually
could<00:05:38.680> be<00:05:38.710> quite<00:05:38.979> nice<00:05:39.099> maybe<00:05:39.430> if<00:05:39.550> there<00:05:39.699> were

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:39.789 
could be quite nice maybe if there were

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:41.159 
could be quite nice maybe if there were
little<00:05:39.940> leather<00:05:40.330> shops<00:05:40.690> but<00:05:40.900> they're<00:05:41.050> still

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
little leather shops but they're still

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:44.399 
little leather shops but they're still
nice<00:05:41.379> and<00:05:41.650> just<00:05:41.800> brian<00:05:42.520> straps<00:05:42.940> and<00:05:43.270> they<00:05:44.199> also

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:44.409 
nice and just brian straps and they also

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:46.829 
nice and just brian straps and they also
like<00:05:45.099> the<00:05:45.490> majority<00:05:45.759> I<00:05:45.909> think<00:05:46.300> all<00:05:46.659> the

00:05:46.829 --> 00:05:46.839 
like the majority I think all the

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:48.930 
like the majority I think all the
collages<00:05:47.289> fold<00:05:47.529> up<00:05:47.680> but<00:05:47.860> it<00:05:47.949> does<00:05:48.159> fold<00:05:48.490> up<00:05:48.669> and

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
collages fold up but it does fold up and

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.180 
collages fold up but it does fold up and
yeah<00:05:49.539> there's<00:05:49.870> not<00:05:50.080> really<00:05:50.259> a<00:05:50.409> lot<00:05:50.469> to<00:05:50.830> it<00:05:50.979> I<00:05:51.129> do

yeah there's not really a lot to it I do

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.730 
yeah there's not really a lot to it I do
really<00:05:51.669> recommend<00:05:51.909> I<00:05:52.509> am<00:05:52.690> a<00:05:52.719> fan<00:05:53.110> of<00:05:53.139> the<00:05:53.560> long

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
love it and I've been using this for the

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.980 
love it and I've been using this for the
past<00:06:00.430> couple<00:06:00.729> of<00:06:00.849> months<00:06:01.089> I<00:06:01.419> know<00:06:01.479> it<00:06:01.779> doesn't

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
past couple of months I know it doesn't

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.260 
past couple of months I know it doesn't
look<00:06:02.229> damaged<00:06:02.919> in<00:06:03.190> any<00:06:03.339> way<00:06:03.460> and<00:06:03.909> I<00:06:03.969> use<00:06:04.120> it

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.270 
look damaged in any way and I use it

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.689 
look damaged in any way and I use it
daily<00:06:04.539> so<00:06:04.930> they<00:06:05.440> really<00:06:05.710> do<00:06:05.889> last<00:06:06.129> quite<00:06:06.339> well

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:06.699 
daily so they really do last quite well

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:08.820 
daily so they really do last quite well
and<00:06:07.000> I<00:06:07.509> think<00:06:07.659> they're<00:06:07.930> pretty<00:06:08.050> timeless<00:06:08.529> the

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
and I think they're pretty timeless the

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.439 
and I think they're pretty timeless the
long<00:06:09.009> shot<00:06:09.219> collages<00:06:09.789> are<00:06:09.909> really<00:06:10.089> timeless

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:10.449 
long shot collages are really timeless

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:12.149 
long shot collages are really timeless
and<00:06:10.599> they're<00:06:10.719> not<00:06:10.900> really<00:06:11.409> really<00:06:11.770> overpriced

00:06:12.149 --> 00:06:12.159 
and they're not really really overpriced

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:14.459 
and they're not really really overpriced
I<00:06:12.430> mean<00:06:12.610> they<00:06:12.729> aren't<00:06:13.060> cheap<00:06:13.180> but<00:06:13.839> if<00:06:14.110> you<00:06:14.259> want

00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:14.469 
I mean they aren't cheap but if you want

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:16.260 
I mean they aren't cheap but if you want
them<00:06:14.680> to<00:06:15.039> spend<00:06:15.310> a<00:06:15.370> bit<00:06:15.550> more<00:06:15.580> money<00:06:15.729> on<00:06:16.000> a<00:06:16.029> bag

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:16.270 
them to spend a bit more money on a bag

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.329 
them to spend a bit more money on a bag
long-term<00:06:17.139> collages<00:06:17.650> are<00:06:17.800> a<00:06:17.830> great<00:06:18.129> option

00:06:18.329 --> 00:06:18.339 
long-term collages are a great option

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:20.399 
long-term collages are a great option
because<00:06:19.060> they're<00:06:19.240> not<00:06:19.409> ridiculously

00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:20.409 
because they're not ridiculously

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:21.970 
because they're not ridiculously
extortionate<00:06:21.159> ly<00:06:21.310> priced

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:21.980 
extortionate ly priced

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.470 
extortionate ly priced
