you<00:01:19.009> get<00:01:19.189> leverage<00:01:20.020> less<00:01:21.020> tilt<00:01:21.499> right<00:01:22.100> so<00:01:22.959> we

00:01:23.949 --> 00:01:23.959 
you get leverage less tilt right so we

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:27.639 
you get leverage less tilt right so we
decided<00:01:24.380> to<00:01:25.240> reposition<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:26.689> drug<00:01:26.929> outside

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649
