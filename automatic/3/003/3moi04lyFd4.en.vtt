00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
have a bar you could easily use the

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:46.750 
have a bar you could easily use the
windowsill<00:00:43.760> or<00:00:44.030> a<00:00:44.090> table<00:00:44.829> the<00:00:45.829> idea<00:00:46.340> is<00:00:46.460> to<00:00:46.640> be

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
windowsill or a table the idea is to be

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.910 
windowsill or a table the idea is to be
as<00:00:46.879> correct<00:00:47.539> as<00:00:47.840> possible<00:00:48.350> now<00:00:48.530> what<00:00:48.739> we're

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
as correct as possible now what we're

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.520 
as correct as possible now what we're
doing<00:00:49.250> is<00:00:49.429> we're<00:00:50.149> stretching<00:00:50.570> the<00:00:50.899> hamstrings

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
doing is we're stretching the hamstrings

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.689 
doing is we're stretching the hamstrings
and<00:00:51.859> the<00:00:51.949> lower<00:00:52.370> back<00:00:53.710> again<00:00:54.710> if<00:00:54.920> you<00:00:55.190> can't<00:00:55.460> do

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
and the lower back again if you can't do

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:58.509 
and the lower back again if you can't do
it<00:00:55.730> on<00:00:55.910> a<00:00:55.940> table<00:00:56.420> then<00:00:56.629> do<00:00:56.809> it<00:00:56.929> on<00:00:57.019> a<00:00:57.079> chair<00:00:57.519> it's

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
it on a table then do it on a chair it's

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:01.540

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
all about you finding the maximum

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.060 
all about you finding the maximum
stretch<00:01:01.999> within<00:01:02.929> your<00:01:03.309> capabilities

stretch within your capabilities

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.340 
stretch within your capabilities

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
this is how it can be and it should be

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.830 
this is how it can be and it should be
now<00:01:21.979> what<00:01:22.159> the<00:01:22.280> dancer<00:01:22.700> is<00:01:22.960> always<00:01:23.960> swap<00:01:24.259> sides

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
now what the dancer is always swap sides

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.469 
now what the dancer is always swap sides
if<00:01:27.189> you<00:01:28.189> can<00:01:28.460> achieve<00:01:28.670> this

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
particular goal now again find a table

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:47.830 
particular goal now again find a table
or<00:01:45.079> windowsill<00:01:46.060> stretches<00:01:47.060> correctly<00:01:47.750> as

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
or windowsill stretches correctly as

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.080 
or windowsill stretches correctly as
possible<00:01:48.520> bending<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.700> legs<00:01:51.310> if<00:01:52.310> I<00:01:52.820> may
