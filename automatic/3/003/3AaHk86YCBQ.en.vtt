00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:07.529
 Hi, I'm Diego and welcome to 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:12.200
 solves the first screencast in Spanish 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.200
 dedicated to burgos vector users 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:19.940
 We will see how to work with vector works and 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:23.330
 the personalized sunsets they offer 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:26.210
 we have a simple wall that we are going to 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.940
 use as an example the first thing that 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.700
 we do is we go to our palette of 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.830
 construction tools and 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.440
 we select from our list a 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.930
 door 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.230
 and we see a preview of the 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:44.289
 door is inserted into the wall the 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.820
 which will be preselected with those lines 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:49.150
 red 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.579
 I put a door with a first click and 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.070
 this way and simply moving the 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.610
 cursor I can determine which side you're going 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.250
 to open the casement 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.260
 with the second click he placed it in his 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:06.270
 site and so that the location is accurate 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.270
 he pressed the button that says set 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.150
 position and selected a point of 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.850
 reference and the other at the end of the 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.820
 door and I put the distance in this 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.840
 case I want you to a 50 meter from the 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.960
 boron 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.000
 and check this and place a dimension 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.240
 here 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.720
 we go that is one meter 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.720
 fifty 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:36.060
 the next one is to press on the button that 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:39.360
 it says configuration and here we can 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.760
 start to see the details of the of the 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:47.070
 door in this case let's change the 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:49.650
 view to an isometric view and let's 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.890
 make sure that our height our 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.500
 width of 210 can we differentiate the 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.530
 size of the sheet if we want the 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.430
 sheet is 0 90 or the size of the bathroom in 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.700
 this case 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.270
 as in all this we have a very door 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.270
 simple 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:14.450
 but without making many changes we are going to 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.270
 customize this door according to what 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.970
 that we need I select the door 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:24.200
 then in the configuration button and 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:28.460
 I start first let's give it a width 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:31.730
 it is enough to write 140 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:34.670
 in this case we are going to leave it with the turn 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.330
 simple and we're going to go to the option of 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:41.960
 lights that will give us the option of 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.760
 generate side windows walls the 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.270
 first we're going to make it 40 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.500
 centimeters and the second of 20 then 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:53.530
 it will be different sizes 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.140
 then in the sheet option right now it's 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.620
 solid but we can select several 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:04.000
 types of glass sheets with panel or a 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:06.820
 personalized and we can choose from a 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.240
 extensive list of symbols that has 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.630
 vector worlds to choose 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:15.870
 in this case I will choose a 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:18.930
 decorative example is for example 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:22.700
 and once it's loaded 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:26.030
 let's make one last modification 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.160
 and it's in the palette of general already has 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.340
 loaded the door in the palette of 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.760
 general I'm going to tell you that the way 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.770
 top of my door be at an angle 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.610
 with a bow 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:42.680
 now they will calculate and show me what 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.410
 I have to verify now is that the 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.440
 size of the sheet be the one that I am 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:51.170
 looking and not be smaller because 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:55.900
 I have reduced the size of the sheet in 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.900
 this case my sheet should be kept 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.140
 0 90 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.840
 by 210 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.769
 all changes are made in a way 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.769
 internal 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:15.600
 I have to make sure it's the 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:18.110
 correct height 210 always pressing 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.580
 the tap key to apply the changes 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:22.670
 Once you 've generated all 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:26.540
 changes 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:30.760
 just press the ok key 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.760
 and a very simple door 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:41.820
 we have generated a much more door 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:44.360
 complex 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:49.660
 with very few changes 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:52.060
 very few clicks very well that's all 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:57.390
 remember that you can always visit in 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.390
