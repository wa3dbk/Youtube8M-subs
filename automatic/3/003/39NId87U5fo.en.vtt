00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
hello today I'm going to show you basics

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.249 
hello today I'm going to show you basics
of<00:00:02.429> animation<00:00:02.580> and<00:00:03.120> key<00:00:03.449> framing<00:00:03.720> in<00:00:03.990> cloud

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
of animation and key framing in cloud

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.230 
of animation and key framing in cloud
that<00:00:04.440> I<00:00:04.560> hope<00:00:04.740> I'm<00:00:05.310> going<00:00:05.460> to<00:00:05.549> start<00:00:05.790> with<00:00:05.970> by

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
that I hope I'm going to start with by

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.820 
that I hope I'm going to start with by
the<00:00:06.299> model<00:00:06.629> that<00:00:06.750> I<00:00:06.899> have<00:00:06.930> I'm<00:00:07.350> going<00:00:07.470> to<00:00:07.560> go<00:00:07.649> to

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
the model that I have I'm going to go to

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.009 
the model that I have I'm going to go to
the<00:00:07.919> rotation<00:00:08.429> and<00:00:08.760> I'm<00:00:09.389> going<00:00:09.510> to<00:00:09.570> create<00:00:09.780> a

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
the rotation and I'm going to create a

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.890 
the rotation and I'm going to create a
keyframe<00:00:10.320> for<00:00:10.530> translation<00:00:11.460> so<00:00:12.150> you<00:00:12.240> can<00:00:12.420> set

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
keyframe for translation so you can set

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.020 
keyframe for translation so you can set
your<00:00:13.019> keyframes<00:00:13.500> for<00:00:13.590> example<00:00:14.040> at<00:00:14.190> my<00:00:14.610> current

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
your keyframes for example at my current

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.660 
your keyframes for example at my current
time<00:00:15.269> is<00:00:15.509> zero<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:15.990> if<00:00:16.949> you<00:00:17.070> click<00:00:17.400> on<00:00:17.430> the

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
time is zero and if you click on the

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.580 
time is zero and if you click on the
label<00:00:17.880> of<00:00:18.150> each<00:00:18.359> parameters<00:00:18.869> in<00:00:19.080> transform

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
label of each parameters in transform

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.260 
label of each parameters in transform
plot<00:00:19.800> for<00:00:20.070> example<00:00:20.400> I'm<00:00:20.550> gonna<00:00:20.670> click<00:00:21.060> on

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
plot for example I'm gonna click on

plot for example I'm gonna click on
translation<00:00:21.960> I<00:00:22.080> created<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.619> keyframe<00:00:23.010> here<00:00:23.250> if

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
translation I created a keyframe here if

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.810 
translation I created a keyframe here if
I<00:00:23.760> move<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.210> frame<00:00:24.449> 20<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.400> let's<00:00:26.400> say<00:00:26.580> I'm

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
I move it to frame 20 and let's say I'm

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.450 
I move it to frame 20 and let's say I'm
going<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.029> move<00:00:27.180> this<00:00:27.840> along<00:00:28.050> Y<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.830> then<00:00:29.310> you

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
going to move this along Y and then you

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.250 
going to move this along Y and then you
click<00:00:30.000> under<00:00:30.210> translation<00:00:30.869> you're<00:00:31.050> going<00:00:31.199> to

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
click under translation you're going to

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.910 
click under translation you're going to
create<00:00:31.529> keyframes<00:00:32.540> at<00:00:33.540> frame<00:00:33.899> 20<00:00:34.110> so<00:00:34.680> if<00:00:34.800> you

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
create keyframes at frame 20 so if you

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.799 
create keyframes at frame 20 so if you
hover<00:00:35.160> on<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.790> can<00:00:35.940> see<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.210> information

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
hover on it you can see the information

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.680 
hover on it you can see the information
you<00:00:37.200> can<00:00:37.350> just<00:00:37.500> continue<00:00:37.980> go<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.730> frame<00:00:39.239> 14

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
you can just continue go to the frame 14

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.740 
you can just continue go to the frame 14
for<00:00:39.899> example<00:00:40.320> do<00:00:41.129> some<00:00:41.370> changes<00:00:41.850> whatever<00:00:42.360> you

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
for example do some changes whatever you

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.389 
for example do some changes whatever you
want<00:00:42.989> for<00:00:43.170> example<00:00:43.530> going<00:00:43.680> this<00:00:43.920> way<00:00:44.129> going

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
want for example going this way going

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.900 
want for example going this way going
that<00:00:44.670> way<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.860> click<00:00:46.860> on<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.640> search

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
that way and click on it and the search

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.029 
that way and click on it and the search
keyframes<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:48.930> created<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.649> then<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:49.860> can

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
keyframes is created and then you can

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.610 
keyframes is created and then you can
play<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.730> see<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.360> animation<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.289> there

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
play it and see the animation is there

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.279 
play it and see the animation is there
so<00:00:53.550> remember<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.030> if<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.629> right-click<00:00:54.899> on

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
so remember that if you right-click on

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.689 
so remember that if you right-click on
the<00:00:55.530> labels<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.329> animated<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.780> animatable<00:00:58.379> of

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
the labels of animated and animatable of

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:01.900 
the labels of animated and animatable of
parameters<00:00:59.699> you<00:01:00.239> can<00:01:00.420> also<00:01:00.570> see<00:01:01.469> other

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
parameters you can also see other

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.549 
parameters you can also see other
settings<00:01:02.910> which<00:01:03.329> in<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:03.809> case<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.229> clear

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
settings which in this case is clear

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.859 
settings which in this case is clear
keyframes<00:01:05.159> for<00:01:05.250> example<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.880> can<00:01:06.450> click<00:01:06.780> on

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
keyframes for example I can click on

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.130 
keyframes for example I can click on
this<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.409> all<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.310> keyframes<00:01:08.549> are<00:01:09.119> going<00:01:10.049> to

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
this and all the keyframes are going to

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.670 
this and all the keyframes are going to
get<00:01:10.560> removed<00:01:10.830> remember<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.299> current

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
get removed remember that the current

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.539 
get removed remember that the current
information<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.770> going<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:13.979> be<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.070> stool<00:01:14.340> song

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
information is going to be a stool song

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.469 
information is going to be a stool song
I'm<00:01:14.970> going<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.240> redo<00:01:15.600> this<00:01:16.880> my<00:01:17.880> keyframes<00:01:18.299> lies

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
I'm going to redo this my keyframes lies

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.469 
I'm going to redo this my keyframes lies
here<00:01:18.720> I'm<00:01:18.869> going<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.110> go<00:01:19.200> back<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.860> then<00:01:20.580> at

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
here I'm going to go back and then at

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.570 
here I'm going to go back and then at
this<00:01:21.780> time<00:01:22.020> I'm<00:01:22.470> going<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.770> remove<00:01:23.340> the

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
this time I'm going to remove the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.969 
this time I'm going to remove the
keyframes<00:01:24.090> for<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.810> mesh<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.560> I'm<00:01:25.799> going<00:01:25.920> to

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
keyframes for the mesh so I'm going to

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.490 
keyframes for the mesh so I'm going to
do<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.220> rotation<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.880> same<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.930> just<00:01:28.140> select

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
do the rotation the same you just select

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.370 
do the rotation the same you just select
this<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:29.119> you<00:01:30.119> can<00:01:30.329> first<00:01:31.079> I'm<00:01:31.229> going<00:01:31.320> to

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
this and you can first I'm going to

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.460 
this and you can first I'm going to
create<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.860> keyframe<00:01:32.189> at<00:01:32.729> 0<00:01:33.119> 0<00:01:33.390> 0<00:01:33.570> I'm<00:01:34.110> going<00:01:34.409> to

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
create a keyframe at 0 0 0 I'm going to

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.780 
create a keyframe at 0 0 0 I'm going to
go<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.650> 20<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.659> rotate<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.840> along<00:01:37.009> X<00:01:38.009> direction

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
go to 20 and rotate it along X direction

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.460 
go to 20 and rotate it along X direction
so<00:01:40.549> I<00:01:41.549> click<00:01:41.939> here<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.360> created<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.049> keyframes

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
so I click here I created the keyframes

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.950 
so I click here I created the keyframes
here<00:01:43.530> I'm<00:01:43.860> going<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.100> go<00:01:44.280> here<00:01:44.689> change<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.810> back

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
here I'm going to go here change it back

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.109 
here I'm going to go here change it back
to<00:01:46.020> 0<00:01:48.049> again<00:01:49.049> click<00:01:49.520> keyframes<00:01:50.520> is<00:01:50.640> created

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
to 0 again click keyframes is created

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.330 
to 0 again click keyframes is created
and<00:01:52.130> so<00:01:53.130> on

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.420 

so<00:01:56.909> now<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.090> have<00:01:57.479> this<00:01:57.930> animation<00:01:58.380> here

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.539
