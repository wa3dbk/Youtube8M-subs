the<00:00:01.079> tower<00:00:01.260> is<00:00:01.380> cleared<00:00:01.709> us<00:00:01.800> for<00:00:01.949> takeoff<00:00:02.280> so

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
the tower is cleared us for takeoff so

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.340 
the tower is cleared us for takeoff so
I'm<00:00:02.730> rolling<00:00:02.909> out<00:00:03.179> here<00:00:03.389> on<00:00:03.510> two<00:00:03.659> two<00:00:03.810> two<00:00:04.020> I

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
I'm rolling out here on two two two I

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.470 
I'm rolling out here on two two two I
like<00:00:04.830> to<00:00:05.069> take<00:00:05.279> a<00:00:05.310> look<00:00:05.549> to<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:05.850> left<00:00:06.060> up<00:00:06.299> the

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
like to take a look to the left up the

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.120 
like to take a look to the left up the
approach<00:00:06.930> and<00:00:07.200> make<00:00:07.350> sure<00:00:07.500> somebody<00:00:07.770> isn't

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
approach and make sure somebody isn't

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.310 
approach and make sure somebody isn't
coming<00:00:08.370> in<00:00:08.490> without<00:00:08.580> calling<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.179> tower<00:00:09.389> it's

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
coming in without calling the tower it's

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.100 
coming in without calling the tower it's
been<00:00:10.530> known<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:10.740> happen<00:00:11.630> take<00:00:12.630> a<00:00:12.660> quick<00:00:12.900> look

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
been known to happen take a quick look

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.279 
been known to happen take a quick look
and<00:00:13.380> look<00:00:13.830> down<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.040> runway<00:00:17.960> and<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.109> wind

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
and look down the runway and the wind

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.040 
and look down the runway and the wind
was<00:00:19.970> five<00:00:20.970> or<00:00:21.000> six<00:00:21.180> knots<00:00:21.570> right<00:00:21.779> down<00:00:21.930> the

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
was five or six knots right down the

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.220 
was five or six knots right down the
runway<00:00:22.320> shouldn't<00:00:22.650> really<00:00:22.800> be<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:23.039> factor<00:00:23.490> so

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
runway shouldn't really be a factor so

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.019 
runway shouldn't really be a factor so
just<00:00:25.230> push<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.590> power<00:00:25.740> in<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.430> I'll<00:00:26.820> take<00:00:26.970> a

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
just push the power in and I'll take a

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.700 
just push the power in and I'll take a
look<00:00:27.240> down<00:00:27.449> here<00:00:27.630> in<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.810> second<00:00:28.170> just<00:00:28.199> quick

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710

look down here in a second just quick
look<00:00:28.890> at<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.070> gauges<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.929> now<00:00:30.929> it's<00:00:31.080> starting

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
look at the gauges and now it's starting

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.479 
look at the gauges and now it's starting
to<00:00:31.439> get<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.590> little<00:00:31.740> light<00:00:32.040> on<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.219> tires

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
to get a little light on the tires

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.510 
to get a little light on the tires
really<00:00:32.850> have<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.149> pay<00:00:33.300> attention<00:00:33.690> here<00:00:34.520> and

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
really have to pay attention here and

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.549 
really have to pay attention here and
here<00:00:35.760> we're<00:00:35.910> gonna<00:00:36.000> lift<00:00:36.270> off<00:00:36.480> now<00:00:36.840> only<00:00:37.440> gonna

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
get to about 120 miles an hour before I

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.840 
get to about 120 miles an hour before I
start<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.469> climb<00:00:43.680> away<00:00:43.920> from<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.190> runway<00:00:44.460> that

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
start to climb away from the runway that

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.690 
start to climb away from the runway that
unloads<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.570> RPM<00:00:46.140> or<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:47.039> actually<00:00:47.370> unloads

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
unloads the RPM or it actually unloads

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.000 
unloads the RPM or it actually unloads
the<00:00:48.300> high<00:00:48.690> pitch<00:00:48.960> cruise<00:00:49.289> prop<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.710> lets<00:00:49.890> me

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
the high pitch cruise prop and lets me

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.860 
the high pitch cruise prop and lets me
get<00:00:50.100> up<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.340> about<00:00:50.489> 2,300<00:00:51.149> rpm<00:00:51.239> so<00:00:51.690> here

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
get up to about 2,300 rpm so here

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.720 
get up to about 2,300 rpm so here
there's<00:00:52.079> about<00:00:52.199> 120<00:00:52.829> miles<00:00:52.980> an<00:00:53.160> hour<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.550> I'm

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
there's about 120 miles an hour and I'm

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.580

gonna<00:00:53.820> let<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.059> start<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.329> climb<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:55.410> just

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
gonna let it start to climb and it just

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.319 
gonna let it start to climb and it just
climbs<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.890> lot<00:00:56.070> better<00:00:56.280> if<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.789> let<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.059> get<00:00:57.270> a

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
climbs a lot better if I let it get a

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.180 
climbs a lot better if I let it get a
little<00:00:58.050> bit<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.260> forward<00:00:58.530> speed<00:00:58.559> there<00:00:59.039> and

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190

we<00:01:29.009> climb<00:01:29.250> out<00:01:29.400> here<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.790> can<00:01:29.939> see<00:01:30.119> it's<00:01:30.329> a

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
we climb out here you can see it's a

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.170 
we climb out here you can see it's a
nice<00:01:30.600> clear<00:01:30.840> day<00:01:31.020> it's<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.470> second<00:01:31.799> in<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.950> row

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
it was a little bit windier today but

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.859 
it was a little bit windier today but
not<00:01:34.950> as<00:01:35.100> much<00:01:35.250> haze<00:01:35.490> early<00:01:35.880> on<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.420> little<00:01:36.689> bit

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
not as much haze early on a little bit

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.050 
not as much haze early on a little bit
of<00:01:36.900> turbulence<00:01:37.110> we<00:01:37.560> got<00:01:37.770> bumped<00:01:38.159> more<00:01:38.820> on<00:01:38.970> the

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.429 
of turbulence we got bumped more on the
way<00:01:39.150> back<00:01:39.360> then<00:01:39.570> on<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.780> way<00:01:39.869> out<00:01:40.020> here<00:01:40.350> it

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
way back then on the way out here it

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.460 
way back then on the way out here it
wasn't<00:01:40.710> too<00:01:40.829> bad<00:01:41.180> I<00:01:42.180> did<00:01:42.720> try<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:42.960> get<00:01:43.110> an<00:01:43.200> idea

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
wasn't too bad I did try to get an idea

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.859 
wasn't too bad I did try to get an idea
for<00:01:43.680> what<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.860> camera<00:01:44.250> could<00:01:44.460> see<00:01:44.869> long

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
for what the camera could see long

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.330 
for what the camera could see long
distance<00:01:46.290> I'll<00:01:46.470> turn<00:01:46.680> around<00:01:46.950> here<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.189> try

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
distance I'll turn around here and try

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.399 
distance I'll turn around here and try
to<00:01:47.399> look<00:01:47.579> back<00:01:47.759> at<00:01:47.939> Columbus<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.600> think<00:01:49.350> I

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
to look back at Columbus I think I

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.010 
to look back at Columbus I think I
didn't<00:01:49.590> turn<00:01:49.740> quite<00:01:50.070> far<00:01:50.430> enough<00:01:50.549> but<00:01:51.540> even<00:01:51.689> so

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
didn't turn quite far enough but even so

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.569 
didn't turn quite far enough but even so
the<00:01:52.320> resolution<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.399> long<00:01:53.549> distance

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
the resolution and the long distance

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.179 
the resolution and the long distance
stuff<00:01:54.119> just<00:01:54.329> isn't<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:54.810> good<00:01:55.049> now<00:01:55.770> here<00:01:56.159> I

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
stuff just isn't that good now here I

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.709 
stuff just isn't that good now here I
cut<00:01:56.549> out<00:01:56.579> some<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.030> cruise<00:01:57.240> here's<00:01:57.570> where

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
cut out some of the cruise here's where

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.050 
cut out some of the cruise here's where
I'm<00:01:57.840> pulling<00:01:58.140> into<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.560> first<00:01:58.740> loop<00:01:59.060> and

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
I'm pulling into the first loop and

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.149 
I'm pulling into the first loop and
coming<00:02:00.450> across<00:02:00.659> here<00:02:01.140> just<00:02:01.590> kind<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:01.890> looking

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
coming across here just kind of looking

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.620 
coming across here just kind of looking
back<00:02:02.219> now<00:02:02.579> here<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:02.790> could<00:02:03.030> see<00:02:03.180> downtown

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
back now here I could see downtown

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.209 
back now here I could see downtown
Columbus<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.229> can't<00:02:04.469> see<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:04.770> with<00:02:05.070> this

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
Columbus you can't see it with this

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.180 
Columbus you can't see it with this
camera<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:06.450> looking<00:02:07.200> straight<00:02:07.500> down<00:02:07.770> now

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
camera and looking straight down now

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.119 
camera and looking straight down now
powers<00:02:08.610> off<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.849> little<00:02:09.090> bit<00:02:09.649> and<00:02:10.649> I'll<00:02:10.890> feed

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
powers off a little bit and I'll feed

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.830 
powers off a little bit and I'll feed
the<00:02:11.280> power<00:02:11.459> back<00:02:11.790> in<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.300> just<00:02:12.390> gonna<00:02:12.540> let<00:02:12.750> the

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
the power back in and just gonna let the

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
the power back in and just gonna let the
nose<00:02:13.020> keep<00:02:13.290> coming

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
nose keep coming

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.860 
nose keep coming
up<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.220> roll<00:02:14.370> into<00:02:14.580> a<00:02:14.760> aileron<00:02:15.480> roll<00:02:15.660> to<00:02:15.810> the

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
up and roll into a aileron roll to the

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.960 
up and roll into a aileron roll to the
left<00:02:16.140> that<00:02:17.130> will<00:02:17.220> come<00:02:17.400> out<00:02:17.430> of<00:02:17.640> this<00:02:17.730> a<00:02:17.790> little

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
left that will come out of this a little

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.250 
left that will come out of this a little
bit<00:02:18.180> in<00:02:18.270> those<00:02:18.390> down<00:02:18.660> whole<00:02:18.870> lot<00:02:19.050> of<00:02:19.140> air

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
bit in those down whole lot of air

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260 
bit in those down whole lot of air
speeds<00:02:19.590> so<00:02:19.860> we're<00:02:20.010> gonna<00:02:20.130> go<00:02:20.340> right<00:02:20.640> back<00:02:20.670> into

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
speeds so we're gonna go right back into

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.270 
speeds so we're gonna go right back into
a<00:02:21.300> loop<00:02:21.480> now<00:02:22.140> this<00:02:22.380> one<00:02:22.560> I'm<00:02:22.680> gonna<00:02:22.800> do<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.040> half

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
a loop now this one I'm gonna do a half

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.490 
a loop now this one I'm gonna do a half
roll<00:02:23.460> at<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:23.790> top<00:02:24.030> almost<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:24.660> half<00:02:25.050> Cuban

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
roll at the top almost a half Cuban

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.310 
roll at the top almost a half Cuban
eight<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:25.890> just<00:02:26.150> roll<00:02:27.150> out<00:02:27.330> on<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.810> down<00:02:27.990> line

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
eight and just roll out on the down line

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.160 
eight and just roll out on the down line
kind<00:02:29.070> of<00:02:29.220> mushy<00:02:29.400> lis<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:29.790> then<00:02:30.600> just<00:02:30.930> roll

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
kind of mushy lis and then just roll

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.350 
kind of mushy lis and then just roll
into<00:02:31.410> a<00:02:31.560> turn<00:02:31.860> back<00:02:32.130> to<00:02:32.400> mass<00:02:32.790> towards<00:02:33.210> the

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
into a turn back to mass towards the

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.690 
into a turn back to mass towards the
west<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:33.990> continue<00:02:34.440> on<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.740> Madison<00:02:35.100> County

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.640 

and<00:02:38.700> as<00:02:38.910> I<00:02:38.940> come<00:02:39.240> around<00:02:39.360> I'm<00:02:40.320> still

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
and as I come around I'm still

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.350 
and as I come around I'm still
frolicking<00:02:41.160> a<00:02:41.250> little<00:02:41.490> bit<00:02:41.610> I<00:02:41.640> think<00:02:41.850> we<00:02:42.150> got

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
frolicking a little bit I think we got

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.660 
frolicking a little bit I think we got
another<00:02:42.660> loop<00:02:42.900> coming<00:02:43.320> and<00:02:43.710> another<00:02:44.400> roll

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
another loop coming and another roll

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.390 
another loop coming and another roll
after<00:02:45.060> that<00:02:45.650> that's<00:02:46.650> just<00:02:46.980> coming<00:02:47.190> back

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
after that that's just coming back

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.880 
after that that's just coming back
around<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.000> West<00:02:48.180> here<00:02:48.510> and<00:02:49.110> a<00:02:49.380> nice

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
around to the West here and a nice

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.070 
around to the West here and a nice
gentle<00:02:50.400> level<00:02:50.670> off<00:02:50.850> there<00:02:51.510> we<00:02:51.690> go

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
gentle level off there we go

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.500 
gentle level off there we go
you<00:02:53.010> know<00:02:53.220> after<00:02:53.670> that<00:02:53.700> turn<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.150> your<00:02:54.240> speeds

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
you know after that turn to your speeds

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.850 
you know after that turn to your speeds
gonna<00:02:54.750> want<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:55.020> pick<00:02:55.140> up<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.410> few<00:02:55.560> more<00:02:55.710> miles

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
gonna want to pick up a few more miles

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.350 
gonna want to pick up a few more miles
an<00:02:56.100> hour<00:02:56.220> we<00:02:56.460> didn't<00:02:56.760> lose<00:02:56.910> a<00:02:56.940> little<00:02:57.210> bit

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
an hour we didn't lose a little bit

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.660 
an hour we didn't lose a little bit
there<00:02:57.570> so<00:02:57.600> that<00:02:58.500> should<00:02:58.920> be<00:02:58.950> a<00:02:59.130> long<00:02:59.430> enough

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
there so that should be a long enough

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:00.920 
there so that should be a long enough
straight<00:02:59.940> line<00:03:00.120> we're<00:03:00.330> gonna<00:03:00.390> pull<00:03:00.660> into<00:03:00.810> a

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
straight line we're gonna pull into a

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.830 
straight line we're gonna pull into a
loop<00:03:01.140> here<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:01.670> this<00:03:02.670> one<00:03:02.850> we<00:03:03.000> hang<00:03:03.180> real<00:03:03.480> nice

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
loop here and this one we hang real nice

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.870 
loop here and this one we hang real nice
at<00:03:04.050> the<00:03:04.080> top<00:03:04.350> throttle<00:03:04.890> back<00:03:05.040> it's<00:03:05.340> real<00:03:05.550> quiet

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
at the top throttle back it's real quiet

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.120 
at the top throttle back it's real quiet
for<00:03:06.030> a<00:03:06.180> second<00:03:06.570> and<00:03:06.870> again<00:03:07.470> I<00:03:07.620> can<00:03:07.860> see<00:03:07.890> all<00:03:08.100> the

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
for a second and again I can see all the

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.730 
for a second and again I can see all the
way<00:03:08.250> to<00:03:08.280> downtown<00:03:08.580> Columbus<00:03:09.270> from<00:03:09.480> here<00:03:09.740> and

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
way to downtown Columbus from here and

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.970 
way to downtown Columbus from here and
coming<00:03:11.190> down<00:03:11.370> through<00:03:12.110> and<00:03:13.110> towards<00:03:13.860> the

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
coming down through and towards the

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.100 
coming down through and towards the
bottom<00:03:14.280> I<00:03:14.370> feed<00:03:14.580> the<00:03:14.700> throttle<00:03:15.060> back<00:03:15.180> in<00:03:15.450> just

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
bottom I feed the throttle back in just

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.070 
there and that's London Ohio I was just
trying<00:03:30.060> to<00:03:30.120> get<00:03:30.210> an<00:03:30.330> idea<00:03:30.600> of<00:03:30.660> what<00:03:30.840> kind<00:03:31.020> of

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
trying to get an idea of what kind of

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.960 
trying to get an idea of what kind of
detail<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.860> camera<00:03:32.220> could<00:03:32.370> pick<00:03:32.580> up<00:03:32.700> from

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
detail the camera could pick up from

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.600 
detail the camera could pick up from
2,000<00:03:33.630> feet<00:03:33.660> it<00:03:34.560> seems<00:03:34.800> to<00:03:34.920> be<00:03:35.010> aiming<00:03:35.220> pretty

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
2,000 feet it seems to be aiming pretty

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.160 
2,000 feet it seems to be aiming pretty
well<00:03:35.790> that's<00:03:36.090> exactly<00:03:36.570> what<00:03:36.690> I<00:03:36.720> was<00:03:36.870> looking

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.319 

and<00:04:14.980> we're<00:04:15.220> just<00:04:15.340> about<00:04:15.520> here's<00:04:15.940> the<00:04:16.120> end<00:04:16.239> of

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
and we're just about here's the end of

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.599 
and we're just about here's the end of
the<00:04:16.389> runway<00:04:16.919> so<00:04:17.919> I'll<00:04:18.070> start<00:04:18.280> working<00:04:18.549> the

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
the runway so I'll start working the

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.789 
the runway so I'll start working the
flaps<00:04:18.850> down<00:04:19.049> that's<00:04:20.049> gonna<00:04:20.230> need<00:04:20.410> a<00:04:20.470> lot<00:04:20.680> of

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
flaps down that's gonna need a lot of

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.730 
flaps down that's gonna need a lot of
change<00:04:21.459> to<00:04:21.549> the<00:04:21.760> pitch<00:04:21.910> trim<00:04:22.240> takes<00:04:23.139> a<00:04:23.350> quite<00:04:23.710> a

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
change to the pitch trim takes a quite a

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.560 
change to the pitch trim takes a quite a
bit<00:04:23.889> of<00:04:23.919> up<00:04:24.130> nose<00:04:24.370> trim<00:04:24.700> to<00:04:24.910> hold<00:04:25.090> it<00:04:25.240> once<00:04:25.389> the

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
bit of up nose trim to hold it once the

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:38.400 
bit of up nose trim to hold it once the
flaps<00:04:25.810> have<00:04:25.960> gone<00:04:26.110> down<00:04:26.350> I<00:04:36.630> just<00:04:37.630> saw<00:04:37.750> the<00:04:37.810> 172

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
flaps have gone down I just saw the 172

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.040 
flaps have gone down I just saw the 172
go<00:04:38.830> abeam<00:04:39.100> our<00:04:39.310> wing<00:04:39.490> on<00:04:39.730> final<00:04:40.240> so<00:04:40.660> I<00:04:40.690> can<00:04:40.960> go

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
go abeam our wing on final so I can go

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.600 
go abeam our wing on final so I can go
ahead<00:04:41.260> and<00:04:41.440> start<00:04:41.650> my<00:04:41.770> left<00:04:42.010> based<00:04:42.250> runway

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
ahead and start my left based runway

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.450 
ahead and start my left based runway
two-seven<00:04:43.530> and<00:04:44.530> we're<00:04:44.800> down<00:04:44.919> to<00:04:45.100> about<00:04:45.280> 80

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
two-seven and we're down to about 80

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.909 
two-seven and we're down to about 80
miles<00:04:45.700> an<00:04:45.850> hour<00:04:45.970> here<00:04:46.300> flaps<00:04:46.600> are<00:04:46.750> down<00:04:46.919> I'll

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
miles an hour here flaps are down I'll

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:49.830 
miles an hour here flaps are down I'll
be<00:04:48.040> looking<00:04:48.340> back<00:04:48.460> towards<00:04:48.820> the<00:04:48.940> runway<00:04:49.090> as<00:04:49.419> I

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
be looking back towards the runway as I

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.629 
be looking back towards the runway as I
get<00:04:50.110> on<00:04:50.229> base<00:04:50.440> leg<00:04:50.710> here<00:04:51.010> I'll<00:04:51.220> look<00:04:51.400> off<00:04:51.610> to

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
get on base leg here I'll look off to

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:53.790 
get on base leg here I'll look off to
the<00:04:51.820> right<00:04:52.060> again<00:04:52.330> somebody<00:04:53.320> might<00:04:53.650> be<00:04:53.770> making

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
the right again somebody might be making

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.830 
the right again somebody might be making
a<00:04:54.100> straight-in<00:04:54.370> approach<00:04:54.550> that's<00:04:55.060> not<00:04:55.300> active

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
a straight-in approach that's not active

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.870 
a straight-in approach that's not active
on<00:04:55.960> the<00:04:56.080> radio<00:04:56.320> so<00:04:56.620> it's<00:04:57.040> a<00:04:57.160> good<00:04:57.340> idea<00:04:57.400> to<00:04:57.729> take

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
on the radio so it's a good idea to take

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.450 
on the radio so it's a good idea to take
a<00:04:57.940> look<00:04:58.260> and<00:04:59.260> hear<00:04:59.590> I'm<00:04:59.770> feeling<00:05:00.160> that<00:05:00.250> wind

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
a look and hear I'm feeling that wind

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.940 
a look and hear I'm feeling that wind
behind<00:05:00.790> me<00:05:00.910> so<00:05:01.780> it's<00:05:01.930> gonna<00:05:02.110> be<00:05:02.320> a<00:05:02.350> strong<00:05:02.650> left

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
behind me so it's gonna be a strong left

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.830 
behind me so it's gonna be a strong left
crosswind<00:05:03.490> on<00:05:03.610> landing<00:05:03.940> here<00:05:04.120> so<00:05:04.540> I<00:05:04.570> want<00:05:04.810> to

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
crosswind on landing here so I want to

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.320 
crosswind on landing here so I want to
start<00:05:05.050> my<00:05:05.229> turn<00:05:05.470> to<00:05:05.590> final<00:05:05.919> early<00:05:06.280> with<00:05:07.180> that

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
start my turn to final early with that

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.850 
start my turn to final early with that
wind<00:05:07.510> behind<00:05:07.810> me<00:05:07.930> it'll<00:05:08.080> make<00:05:08.200> it<00:05:08.320> a<00:05:08.380> wide<00:05:08.560> turn

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
wind behind me it'll make it a wide turn

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.460 
wind behind me it'll make it a wide turn
you<00:05:09.639> can<00:05:09.790> see<00:05:09.940> the<00:05:10.060> runway<00:05:10.360> out<00:05:10.540> there<00:05:10.810> should

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
you can see the runway out there should

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.560 
you can see the runway out there should
be<00:05:11.560> coming<00:05:11.830> into<00:05:11.950> alignment<00:05:12.270> I'm<00:05:13.270> close

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
be coming into alignment I'm close

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.719 
be coming into alignment I'm close
enough<00:05:13.840> in<00:05:14.080> I'm<00:05:14.500> going<00:05:14.830> to<00:05:14.919> not<00:05:15.400> going<00:05:15.550> to<00:05:15.610> go

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:15.729 
enough in I'm going to not going to go

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:17.370 
enough in I'm going to not going to go
into<00:05:15.940> a<00:05:15.970> crab<00:05:16.270> I'm<00:05:16.479> gonna<00:05:16.660> go<00:05:16.810> right<00:05:17.020> into<00:05:17.200> a

keep it straight down the runway now
here<00:05:55.390> I'm<00:05:55.510> pulling<00:05:55.690> back<00:05:55.930> to<00:05:56.050> throttle<00:05:56.440> and<00:05:56.590> in

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:56.950 
here I'm pulling back to throttle and in

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:58.920 
here I'm pulling back to throttle and in
the<00:05:57.070> flare<00:05:57.310> and<00:05:57.550> I<00:05:57.850> want<00:05:58.000> to<00:05:58.060> disagree<00:05:58.270> sit<00:05:58.780> on

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
the flare and I want to disagree sit on

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.409 
the flare and I want to disagree sit on
but<00:05:59.620> of<00:05:59.740> course<00:05:59.950> I<00:06:00.100> don't<00:06:00.340> and<00:06:00.640> that's<00:06:01.300> a

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:01.419 
but of course I don't and that's a

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:03.000 
but of course I don't and that's a
pretty<00:06:01.690> good<00:06:01.780> sized<00:06:02.080> bounce<00:06:02.350> there<00:06:02.650> there's

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.010 
pretty good sized bounce there there's

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:04.740 
pretty good sized bounce there there's
the<00:06:03.190> second<00:06:03.550> third<00:06:03.760> fourth<00:06:04.270> bounce<00:06:04.510> and

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 
the second third fourth bounce and

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:05.940 
the second third fourth bounce and
there's<00:06:04.870> a<00:06:04.960> little<00:06:05.140> bit<00:06:05.350> of<00:06:05.440> left<00:06:05.590> rudder<00:06:05.770> to

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:05.950 
there's a little bit of left rudder to

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.550 
there's a little bit of left rudder to
get<00:06:06.100> us<00:06:06.190> straightened<00:06:06.550> out<00:06:06.640> and<00:06:07.140> that<00:06:08.140> gets<00:06:08.410> us

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 
get us straightened out and that gets us

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.490 
get us straightened out and that gets us
safely<00:06:08.979> on<00:06:09.220> the<00:06:09.340> ground
