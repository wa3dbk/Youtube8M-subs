we're all really busy people these days
and<00:00:11.759> a<00:00:11.790> lot<00:00:11.820> of<00:00:11.940> us<00:00:12.090> haven't<00:00:12.300> got<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:12.480> lot<00:00:12.599> of

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
and a lot of us haven't got a lot of

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.749 
and a lot of us haven't got a lot of
time<00:00:12.960> so<00:00:13.469> it's<00:00:13.620> really<00:00:13.889> important<00:00:14.490> when<00:00:14.610> you

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
time so it's really important when you

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.730 
time so it's really important when you
do<00:00:15.030> practice<00:00:15.570> that<00:00:15.750> you<00:00:15.839> structure<00:00:16.260> your<00:00:16.440> time

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
do practice that you structure your time

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.340 
do practice that you structure your time
effectively<00:00:17.490> so<00:00:18.420> you<00:00:18.600> get<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.869> most<00:00:19.080> out<00:00:19.320> of

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
effectively so you get the most out of

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.710 
effectively so you get the most out of
your<00:00:19.529> practice<00:00:19.650> time<00:00:20.100> so<00:00:20.760> today<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.390> couple<00:00:21.570> of

just a quick top tip on how to structure
your<00:00:24.600> practice<00:00:25.170> time<00:00:25.820> now<00:00:26.820> in<00:00:27.210> my<00:00:27.359> opinion

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
your practice time now in my opinion

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.839 
your practice time now in my opinion
this<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:27.869> what<00:00:28.080> works<00:00:28.289> for<00:00:28.410> me<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.859> find<00:00:29.550> I've

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
this is what works for me I find I've

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.359 
this is what works for me I find I've
divided<00:00:30.240> always<00:00:30.810> divide<00:00:31.080> my<00:00:31.260> practice<00:00:31.679> into

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
divided always divide my practice into

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.959 
divided always divide my practice into
four<00:00:33.059> sections<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:34.399> I've<00:00:35.399> got<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.700> do<00:00:35.790> all

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
four sections and I've got to do all

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.370 
four sections and I've got to do all
four<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.239> these<00:00:36.390> sections<00:00:36.809> every<00:00:37.170> time<00:00:37.290> I

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
four of these sections every time I

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.319 
four of these sections every time I
practice<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:38.250> order<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.550> get<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.820> most<00:00:39.030> out<00:00:39.300> of

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
practice in order to get the most out of

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.119 
practice in order to get the most out of
my<00:00:39.559> practice<00:00:40.559> session

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
my practice session

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.889 
my practice session
even<00:00:41.670> if<00:00:41.760> I've<00:00:41.879> only<00:00:42.059> got<00:00:42.270> 10<00:00:42.540> minutes<00:00:42.719> to

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
even if I've only got 10 minutes to

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.470 
even if I've only got 10 minutes to
practice<00:00:43.079> okay<00:00:43.829> here<00:00:44.340> are<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.489> parts<00:00:44.730> first

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
practice okay here are the parts first

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.180 
practice okay here are the parts first
of<00:00:45.660> all<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:45.840> need<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.079> have<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.230> warm-up<00:00:46.590> well

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
of all you need to have a warm-up well

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.799 
of all you need to have a warm-up well
that's<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.430> first<00:00:47.640> part<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.940> warm-up<00:00:48.210> there

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
that's the first part of warm-up there

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.529 
that's the first part of warm-up there
needs<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.110> be<00:00:49.200> some<00:00:50.010> technical<00:00:50.579> practice<00:00:51.090> my

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
needs to be some technical practice my

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.750 
needs to be some technical practice my
scales<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.289> things<00:00:52.320> like<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.370> then<00:00:53.730> I

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
scales and things like that and then I

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.549 
scales and things like that and then I
need<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.300> bulk<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.719> my<00:00:54.780> practice<00:00:55.230> session

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
need to the bulk of my practice session

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.470 
need to the bulk of my practice session
is<00:00:55.920> working<00:00:56.309> on<00:00:56.399> something<00:00:56.699> new<00:00:57.090> something

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
is working on something new something

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.779 
is working on something new something
challenging<00:00:57.899> something<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.129> can't<00:00:59.430> do

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
challenging something that I can't do

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.810 
challenging something that I can't do
yet<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.359> then<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.289> last<00:01:01.500> thing<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:02.309> doing

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
yet and then the last thing is doing

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.219 
yet and then the last thing is doing
something<00:01:03.000> fun<00:01:03.270> okay

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
something fun okay

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.230 
something fun okay
something<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:04.860> feel<00:01:05.220> good<00:01:05.640> about<00:01:05.790> when<00:01:06.210> I

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
something that I feel good about when I

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.880 
something that I feel good about when I
play<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.869> think<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.200> sounds<00:01:07.560> great

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
play I think it sounds great

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.260 
play I think it sounds great
and<00:01:08.130> makes<00:01:09.119> me<00:01:09.890> encourages<00:01:10.890> me<00:01:11.010> at<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.030> end<00:01:12.150> of

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
and makes me encourages me at the end of

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.120 
and makes me encourages me at the end of
the<00:01:12.360> practice<00:01:12.540> session<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:13.710> those<00:01:13.920> are<00:01:14.070> the

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
the practice session so those are the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.649 
the practice session so those are the
four<00:01:14.340> main<00:01:14.520> sections<00:01:14.939> now<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.210> terms<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.509> how

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
four main sections now in terms of how

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.080 
four main sections now in terms of how
much<00:01:15.810> time<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.350> give<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.619> each<00:01:16.770> what<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.159> do<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.850> I

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
much time to give to each what I do is I

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.789 
much time to give to each what I do is I
divide<00:01:18.270> my<00:01:18.479> amount<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.080> time<00:01:19.229> I've<00:01:19.409> got<00:01:19.590> in

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
divide my amount of time I've got in

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.980 
divide my amount of time I've got in
half<00:01:21.229> one<00:01:22.229> half<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:22.920> only<00:01:23.280> for<00:01:24.090> working

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
half one half of it is only for working

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.760 
half one half of it is only for working
on<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.890> new<00:01:26.580> material<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.180> I'm<00:01:27.270> working<00:01:27.570> on

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
on the new material that I'm working on

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.090 
on the new material that I'm working on
the<00:01:28.770> other<00:01:28.950> half<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.549> divided<00:01:30.000> three<00:01:30.329> sections

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
the other half I divided three sections

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.710 
the other half I divided three sections
so<00:01:32.100> let's<00:01:32.549> say<00:01:32.759> for<00:01:32.790> example<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.299> had<00:01:33.450> 12

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
so let's say for example I had 12

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.620 
so let's say for example I had 12
minutes<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.110> practice<00:01:34.610> okay<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.820> would<00:01:36.390> give

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
minutes of practice okay I would give

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.020 
minutes of practice okay I would give
two<00:01:37.530> minutes<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:38.070> warming<00:01:38.340> up<00:01:38.490> so<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:38.939> would

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
two minutes to warming up so that would

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.660 
two minutes to warming up so that would
be<00:01:39.090> like<00:01:39.240> long<00:01:39.600> tones<00:01:40.020> maybe<00:01:40.950> doing<00:01:41.340> some<00:01:41.520> work

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
be like long tones maybe doing some work

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.389 
be like long tones maybe doing some work
with<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:41.909> tuner<00:01:42.710> just<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.829> get<00:01:43.979> everything

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
with a tuner just to get everything

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.910 
with a tuner just to get everything
working<00:01:44.909> in<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.509> warmed<00:01:46.229> up<00:01:46.380> in<00:01:46.530> my<00:01:46.649> saxophone

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
working in and warmed up in my saxophone

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.520 
working in and warmed up in my saxophone
-<00:01:47.280> I'll<00:01:47.670> do<00:01:48.000> two<00:01:48.299> minutes<00:01:48.450> on<00:01:48.810> technical

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
- I'll do two minutes on technical

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.560 
- I'll do two minutes on technical
studies<00:01:50.310> so<00:01:50.520> maybe<00:01:50.729> things<00:01:50.970> like<00:01:51.060> scales

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
studies so maybe things like scales

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.020 
studies so maybe things like scales
maybe<00:01:52.020> scales<00:01:52.350> in<00:01:52.530> third<00:01:52.740> maybe<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.520> technical

down<00:02:15.439> my<00:02:15.530> practice<00:02:15.680> time<00:02:16.010> now<00:02:16.249> a<00:02:16.280> couple<00:02:16.549> of

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
down my practice time now a couple of

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.220 
down my practice time now a couple of
things<00:02:16.760> to<00:02:17.120> remember<00:02:17.269> about<00:02:17.420> this<00:02:17.749> first<00:02:18.079> of

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
things to remember about this first of

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.110 
things to remember about this first of
all<00:02:18.319> it<00:02:18.650> is<00:02:18.980> so<00:02:19.340> important<00:02:19.879> to<00:02:19.969> do<00:02:20.090> your

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
all it is so important to do your

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.970 
all it is so important to do your
warming<00:02:20.629> up<00:02:20.780> and<00:02:20.989> so<00:02:21.290> important<00:02:21.680> to<00:02:21.739> do<00:02:21.859> your

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
warming up and so important to do your

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.940 
warming up and so important to do your
technique<00:02:22.340> practice<00:02:22.819> do<00:02:23.389> not<00:02:23.810> skip<00:02:24.769> over

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
technique practice do not skip over

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.530 
technique practice do not skip over
those<00:02:25.159> that's<00:02:25.459> so<00:02:25.609> important<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.420> other

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
those that's so important the other

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.349 
those that's so important the other
thing<00:02:26.780> is<00:02:26.900> practice<00:02:27.799> is<00:02:28.010> about<00:02:28.299> working<00:02:29.299> on

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:29.359 
thing is practice is about working on

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:31.410 
thing is practice is about working on
things<00:02:29.569> that<00:02:29.719> you<00:02:29.840> can't<00:02:30.260> already<00:02:30.500> do<00:02:30.859> so

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
things that you can't already do so

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.849 
things that you can't already do so
don't<00:02:32.420> and<00:02:32.840> I'm<00:02:33.200> gonna<00:02:33.500> say<00:02:33.650> that<00:02:33.769> again

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:33.859 
don't and I'm gonna say that again

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:35.470 
don't and I'm gonna say that again
because<00:02:34.040> it's<00:02:34.280> so<00:02:34.430> important<00:02:34.849> practice<00:02:35.329> is

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
because it's so important practice is

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.479 
because it's so important practice is
about<00:02:35.750> working<00:02:36.049> on<00:02:36.260> things<00:02:36.530> that<00:02:36.769> you<00:02:37.189> can't

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
about working on things that you can't

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.220 
about working on things that you can't
yet<00:02:37.939> do<00:02:38.209> okay

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
yet do okay

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.830 
yet do okay
so<00:02:39.799> the<00:02:40.340> purpose<00:02:40.700> of<00:02:40.790> practice<00:02:41.150> is<00:02:41.299> not<00:02:41.569> for

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
so the purpose of practice is not for

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.319 
so the purpose of practice is not for
your<00:02:41.930> neighbors<00:02:42.349> or<00:02:42.799> for<00:02:43.519> your<00:02:43.849> housemates

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
your neighbors or for your housemates

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:46.659 
your neighbors or for your housemates
it's<00:02:44.659> for<00:02:44.989> you<00:02:45.200> to<00:02:45.409> work<00:02:45.620> on<00:02:45.859> something<00:02:46.159> that

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:46.669 
it's for you to work on something that

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:48.580 
it's for you to work on something that
you<00:02:46.790> can't<00:02:47.060> already<00:02:47.269> do<00:02:47.629> so<00:02:48.139> it's<00:02:48.290> not<00:02:48.409> gonna

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
you can't already do so it's not gonna

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.530 
you can't already do so it's not gonna
sound<00:02:48.859> always<00:02:49.340> going<00:02:49.760> to<00:02:49.790> sound<00:02:49.969> fantastic

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
sound always going to sound fantastic

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.449 
sound always going to sound fantastic
because<00:02:50.780> you're<00:02:51.199> developing<00:02:51.469> if<00:02:52.250> you

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
because you're developing if you

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:53.770 
because you're developing if you
approach<00:02:52.730> your<00:02:52.879> practice<00:02:53.209> in<00:02:53.299> that<00:02:53.449> way<00:02:53.569> then

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
approach your practice in that way then

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.809 
approach your practice in that way then
you'll<00:02:53.930> get<00:02:54.109> better<00:02:54.319> really<00:02:55.219> really<00:02:55.549> fast

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
you'll get better really really fast

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.330 
you'll get better really really fast
