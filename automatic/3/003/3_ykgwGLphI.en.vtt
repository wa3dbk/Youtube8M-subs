00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.880
 pond is not a problem at all 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.750
 in the pond are 7000 outstretched 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.489

 the pond has about 3000 square meters 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.480
 and is exactly a main road and 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.690
 since the carp are in there again 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.059
 a lot of blackboard ends and reindeers 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.969
 of course also eat now 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.879
 small carp about two grams 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:55.230
 Two to three have come to an end 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:59.329
 June 25 is precisely or with the camera 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:03.480
 you look very bad without contrast 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:05.250
 one thing clearly shows you that 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.320
 are all just a drink of water 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.189
 out and here are already water fleas too 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.000
 see very clearly 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:14.000
 should only times catch them 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:26.400
 put back and forth what dissolving 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.400
 basic building blocks all level particles 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:35.690
 There are numbers of 100 kilowatts arising 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:39.260
 about ten kilos of fish 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:43.850
 fish-eating water for every fork 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:45.740
 every little creature and above all 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:53.120
 the carp breed or generally the 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:54.910
 fish breed depends on it if you 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.930
 look at the bunch now 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.930
 they are all water fleas 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:11.460
 that's just the church of now 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:12.900
 These are all water fell in the first 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.380
 to recognize water clearly when they 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.380
 move 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:35.370
 400 kilo fish on the hectare just by 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.050
 water can be calculated factor x 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.780
 10 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:42.690
 so many food probably so much nature 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.650
 So produce food file 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.650
 water fleas in keel 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.150
 of 20 seconds 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.250
 the little ones because now they get the 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.250
 water fleas 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:21.560
 four weeks old wise you can see completely 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.560
 clearly the red ones call that 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:34.800
 this is now for approximately two diverse 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:39.590
 days lining clearly on the belly too 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.590
 recognize as follows eat 14 weeks old
