from last year's bright light it's

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.779 
from last year's bright light it's
definitely<00:00:46.379> noticeable<00:00:46.890> however<00:00:47.399> there<00:00:47.610> is

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
definitely noticeable however there is

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.060 
definitely noticeable however there is
evidence<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:48.539> some<00:00:48.780> entry-level<00:00:49.289> imaging

in<00:00:52.920> certain<00:00:53.340> shots<00:00:53.780> it's<00:00:54.780> better<00:00:55.110> than<00:00:55.289> last

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500

noise situation and you'll notice with

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.690 
noise situation and you'll notice with

3200 and low light mode is capable of
6400<00:01:13.110> but<00:01:13.500> one<00:01:13.680> interesting<00:01:13.950> thing<00:01:14.490> about

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
6400 but one interesting thing about

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.120 
6400 but one interesting thing about
this<00:01:14.880> camera<00:01:15.150> is<00:01:15.390> that<00:01:15.810> anything<00:01:16.350> past<00:01:16.890> a

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
this camera is that anything past a

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.010 
this camera is that anything past a
one-second<00:01:17.850> shutter<00:01:18.119> speed<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.509> camera

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
one-second shutter speed the camera

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.460 
one-second shutter speed the camera
defaults<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.890> an<00:01:20.040> ISO<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.700> 100<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.659> we<00:01:22.140> think

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
defaults to an ISO of 100 and we think

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.100 
defaults to an ISO of 100 and we think
that<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.070> protect<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:24.180> integrity<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.840> the

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
that is to protect the integrity of the

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.160 
that is to protect the integrity of the
images<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.920> really<00:01:26.490> reduce<00:01:26.700> noise<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.869> kind

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
images to really reduce noise that kind

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.380 
images to really reduce noise that kind

Canon Powershot SX 230 HS worked the

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.370 
Canon Powershot SX 230 HS worked the
five<00:04:20.660> extra<00:04:21.169> Hamilton's<00:04:21.739> over<00:04:22.130> the<00:04:22.250> SX<00:04:22.610> 210<00:04:23.060> is

five extra Hamilton's over the SX 210 is

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.499 
five extra Hamilton's over the SX 210 is
well<00:04:24.380> if<00:04:24.620> you<00:04:24.800> have<00:04:25.009> to<00:04:25.160> have<00:04:25.280> 1080p<00:04:26.000> HD<00:04:26.360> video

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:26.509 
well if you have to have 1080p HD video

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:29.950 
well if you have to have 1080p HD video
if<00:04:27.229> GPS<00:04:27.830> is<00:04:28.039> very<00:04:28.070> important<00:04:28.789> to<00:04:28.850> you<00:04:29.000> and<00:04:29.240> you

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
if GPS is very important to you and you

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.249 
if GPS is very important to you and you
want<00:04:30.139> to<00:04:30.229> boost<00:04:30.470> in<00:04:30.800> low-light<00:04:31.550> sensitivity

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:32.259 
want to boost in low-light sensitivity

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:35.740 
want to boost in low-light sensitivity
then<00:04:33.259> the<00:04:33.740> Powershot<00:04:34.430> SX<00:04:34.460> 230<00:04:35.240> is<00:04:35.330> is

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
then the Powershot SX 230 is is

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.020 
then the Powershot SX 230 is is
definitely<00:04:36.259> worth<00:04:36.620> it<00:04:36.830> for<00:04:37.070> you<00:04:37.250> we<00:04:37.639> felt<00:04:37.970> that

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
definitely worth it for you we felt that

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.960 
definitely worth it for you we felt that
the<00:04:38.240> SX<00:04:38.660> 230<00:04:39.199> was<00:04:39.470> still<00:04:39.740> superior<00:04:40.160> to<00:04:40.490> the<00:04:40.610> SX

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
the SX 230 was still superior to the SX

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.150 
the SX 230 was still superior to the SX
210<00:04:41.479> but<00:04:41.720> we're<00:04:41.870> still<00:04:42.199> left<00:04:42.530> wanting<00:04:43.010> a

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
210 but we're still left wanting a

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.120 
210 but we're still left wanting a
larger<00:04:43.400> imaging<00:04:44.240> sensor<00:04:44.750> inside<00:04:45.169> and<00:04:45.470> maybe

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
larger imaging sensor inside and maybe

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.090 
larger imaging sensor inside and maybe
open<00:04:46.490> that<00:04:46.850> aperture<00:04:47.389> up<00:04:47.539> to<00:04:47.720> an<00:04:47.840> F<00:04:48.020> 2.0<00:04:48.710> also

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
open that aperture up to an F 2.0 also

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.010 
open that aperture up to an F 2.0 also
give<00:04:49.580> us<00:04:49.699> some<00:04:49.850> more<00:04:49.970> video<00:04:50.270> controls<00:04:50.750> and

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
give us some more video controls and

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.689 
give us some more video controls and
maybe<00:04:51.199> that<00:04:51.440> zoom<00:04:51.800> mic<00:04:52.039> and<00:04:52.280> we<00:04:52.370> think<00:04:52.610> this

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:52.699 
maybe that zoom mic and we think this

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:54.700 
maybe that zoom mic and we think this
camera<00:04:53.120> would<00:04:53.210> be<00:04:53.270> versatile<00:04:53.900> as<00:04:54.050> hell<00:04:54.350> other

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
camera would be versatile as hell other

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.710 
camera would be versatile as hell other

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
than that Canon has done a fantastic job

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.860
