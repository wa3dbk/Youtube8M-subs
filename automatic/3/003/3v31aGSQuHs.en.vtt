00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:18.710
 hello today i will tell you about 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.000
 how we work with micro spike glue 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.289
 on us well 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.919
 blank up the steps and nobody 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:29.009
 details but in the game first we expose 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:35.170
 cutter visually in height 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:36.730
 then install this rail 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.199
 preferably from solid material because 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.769
 that we mill now from solid 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:43.570
 material and check whether 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:46.110
 exposed now show you how it is 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.110
 do 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.770
 and a piece 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.770
 I will say 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.150
 me 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.189
 turn over 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.740
 you fit and check 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:25.250
 how big is the mismatch in height 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.079
 and if there is a discrepancy here but 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.039
 this result is quite me 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:33.530
 satisfies 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:37.849
 and I start training here with us 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:40.219
 folded workpiece kindly on 

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:42.140
 step pencil line drawn 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:44.929
 here it is ahead it will be here first 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.319
 part of one step 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:50.679
 then this side has progressed on 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:54.319
 mikroship u we take the second billet 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:56.390
 frezeruem microspikes on this side and that's 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:58.789
 this one to us is not a good mill 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.489
 already turned over and confused upside down well 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.840
 here we are 

00:02:00.489 --> 00:02:05.799
 I am asking the connected microship 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.799
 observe these 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.850
 that's the way we are 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:07.189
 in despise all blanks 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.189
 smaller shift process 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:15.480
 we put glue on mikroship 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.819
 do it this way for 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:23.269
 In order to speed up the process and not dunk 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:23.269
 permanently brush capacity with glue 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.940
 and smear the brush 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.240
 be sure to watch the glue penetrate 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.240
 in all 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.740
 surface microfire from 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:13.890
 don't rush don't rush sasha glue glue not 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:17.130
 dries here glue mikroship 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:20.430
 I spread the board the right side and put 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.440
 their war we begin to clamp them well 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.870
 pay attention to one thing as we 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.380
 do this in order not to put 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.330
 side clamps but also for more 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.030
 tight compression 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:36.260
 These gold are first drawn up 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.260
 who put the bottom 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:50.770
 then take the war cooked also 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:52.930
 advance and impose them on top well in 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:57.810
 First it improves tightening 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:05:01.810
 microshirt and secondly does not allow 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:04.210
 bend at the top here that's glue 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.280
 but please note that this 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.680
 incomplete gluing 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.370
 not so wide is two steps 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.639
 curly 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:15.159
 and here this seam is not smeared with glue 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:19.569
 just to save space and time here 

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:22.930
 glue it like this 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:26.349
 compression is no longer interesting 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.539
 and here are the edges protruding from stretch 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:29.830
 ordinary 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:34.240
 clamps true enough 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.810
 powerful German clamps but here 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.139
 finished 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:41.710
 the steps are already toned and 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:43.479
 blocked under the steps but these are two 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.610
 steps are arcuate again 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:49.630
 taken out will be on the step 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:51.180
 here they are tinted and blocked by the floor 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.830
 matt varnish hess 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.960
 here here too, under the step see there 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.849
 bottom selected 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.539
 here it is the result of gluing on 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:00.539
 microship
