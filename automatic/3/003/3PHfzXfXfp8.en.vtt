00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:56.789 
feels a lot better than last time we

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:58.129 
feels a lot better than last time we
used<00:04:56.819> him<00:04:57.120> obviously<00:04:57.690> because<00:04:57.810> it's<00:04:57.990> got<00:04:58.110> a

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
used him obviously because it's got a

00:04:58.139 --> 00:04:59.959 
used him obviously because it's got a
snack<00:04:58.349> coddle<00:04:58.770> him<00:04:58.830> but<00:04:59.340> then<00:04:59.520> again<00:04:59.550> is<00:04:59.819> it<00:04:59.940> a

00:04:59.959 --> 00:04:59.969 
snack coddle him but then again is it a

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:02.270 
snack coddle him but then again is it a
placebo<00:05:00.509> as<00:05:00.569> this<00:05:00.719> stuff<00:05:00.960> actually<00:05:01.199> does<00:05:01.560> Rick

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
placebo as this stuff actually does Rick

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.309 
placebo as this stuff actually does Rick
because<00:05:02.639> this<00:05:03.120> would<00:05:03.270> take<00:05:03.449> up<00:05:03.599> to<00:05:03.719> an<00:05:03.810> 87

00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:04.319 
because this would take up to an 87

well<00:05:32.610> if<00:05:32.669> you<00:05:32.729> didn't<00:05:32.880> know<00:05:32.969> that<00:05:33.120> I<00:05:33.150> got

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
well if you didn't know that I got

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.749 
well if you didn't know that I got
faster<00:05:33.719> I<00:05:33.990> reckon<00:05:34.800> if<00:05:34.919> his<00:05:35.039> price<00:05:35.279> range<00:05:35.520> is

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:35.759 
faster I reckon if his price range is

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:36.920 
faster I reckon if his price range is
correct<00:05:36.120> maybe<00:05:36.330> you<00:05:36.449> guys<00:05:36.539> in<00:05:36.690> the<00:05:36.750> comments

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
correct maybe you guys in the comments

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.899 
correct maybe you guys in the comments
explore<00:05:37.349> can<00:05:37.800> guess<00:05:38.009> the<00:05:38.039> price<00:05:38.370> range<00:05:38.699> of

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:38.909 
explore can guess the price range of

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:40.670 
explore can guess the price range of
Jackson<00:05:39.330> madness<00:05:39.719> but<00:05:40.080> I<00:05:40.139> reckon<00:05:40.440> it'll<00:05:40.560> be

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
Jackson madness but I reckon it'll be

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.189 
Jackson madness but I reckon it'll be
quite<00:05:40.889> law<00:05:41.430> because<00:05:42.060> of<00:05:42.150> his<00:05:42.270> league<00:05:42.539> and<00:05:42.810> his

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 
quite law because of his league and his

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:45.200 
quite law because of his league and his
nation<00:05:43.740> as<00:05:43.949> well<00:05:44.190> but<00:05:44.430> because<00:05:44.699> he's<00:05:44.849> have<00:05:45.029> it

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
nation as well but because he's have it

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.420 
nation as well but because he's have it
in<00:05:45.389> who<00:05:45.539> knows<00:05:45.719> what<00:05:45.930> it's<00:05:46.050> when<00:05:46.169> we<00:05:46.259> read<00:05:46.430> over
