00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
because environment is something which

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.399 
because environment is something which
we<00:01:02.789> are<00:01:02.820> not<00:01:03.090> paying<00:01:03.329> attention<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:04.080> at<00:01:04.199> all

nowadays you know we are we are doing

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.480 
nowadays you know we are we are doing
more<00:01:06.869> damage<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.590> environment<00:01:07.710> than<00:01:08.280> good

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
more damage to the environment than good

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.940 
more damage to the environment than good
to<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.790> environment<00:01:08.960> the<00:01:09.960> one<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.680> very

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
to the environment the one of the very

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.789 
to the environment the one of the very
few<00:01:11.280> ways<00:01:11.490> in<00:01:11.520> which<00:01:11.909> we<00:01:12.119> can<00:01:12.299> still<00:01:12.600> save<00:01:13.470> our

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
few ways in which we can still save our

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.980 
few ways in which we can still save our
environment<00:01:14.430> is<00:01:14.610> if<00:01:14.880> we<00:01:15.119> plant<00:01:15.630> more<00:01:15.780> trees

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
environment is if we plant more trees

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.440 
environment is if we plant more trees
there<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.590> more<00:01:16.890> oxygen<00:01:17.460> if<00:01:17.610> there<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.240> more

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
there is more oxygen if there is more

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.109 
there is more oxygen if there is more
oxygen<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.229> think<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:20.310> better<00:01:20.520> pollution

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
oxygen I think it is better pollution

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.950 
oxygen I think it is better pollution
levels<00:01:21.479> decrease<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:23.090> the<00:01:24.090> trees<00:01:24.450> the

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
levels decrease and the trees the

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.649 
levels decrease and the trees the
various<00:01:25.530> species<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:26.400> fauna<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:27.000> flora<00:01:27.180> both

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
various species of fauna and flora both

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.620 
various species of fauna and flora both
disappearing<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:29.130> think<00:01:29.490> on<00:01:30.150> World

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
disappearing and I think on World

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.390 
disappearing and I think on World
Environment<00:01:30.869> Day<00:01:31.350> we<00:01:31.590> should<00:01:31.799> all<00:01:31.979> take<00:01:32.220> an

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
Environment Day we should all take an
