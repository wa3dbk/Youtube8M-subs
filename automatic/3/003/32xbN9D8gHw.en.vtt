00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
level of talent that we've seen taken

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.790 
level of talent that we've seen taken
early<00:00:53.850> on<00:00:54.059> in<00:00:54.210> this<00:00:54.329> round<00:00:54.539> but<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:55.170> do<00:00:55.289> believe

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
early on in this round but I do believe

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.040 
early on in this round but I do believe
he<00:00:55.920> has<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.129> bright<00:00:56.399> future<00:00:56.760> ahead<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.360> I<00:00:57.600> think

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
he has a bright future ahead and I think

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.630 
he has a bright future ahead and I think
he<00:00:58.140> fits<00:00:58.320> nicely<00:00:58.739> with<00:00:59.190> his<00:00:59.219> new

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
he fits nicely with his new

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.880 
he fits nicely with his new
organizations<00:01:00.420> need<00:01:00.660> yeah<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.559> agree<00:01:01.859> that

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
organizations need yeah and I agree that

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.950 
organizations need yeah and I agree that
he<00:01:02.129> might<00:01:02.399> not<00:01:02.609> be<00:01:02.670> on<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.090> same<00:01:03.300> level<00:01:03.600> as<00:01:03.809> the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
he might not be on the same level as the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.810 
he might not be on the same level as the
first<00:01:04.229> couple<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.680> picks<00:01:04.979> but<00:01:05.400> let<00:01:05.549> me<00:01:05.640> tell
