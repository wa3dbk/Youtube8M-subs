ever oh god oh my god it's gonna be one

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.110 
ever oh god oh my god it's gonna be one
of<00:02:44.490> these<00:02:44.610> jumps<00:02:44.940> is<00:02:45.060> it<00:02:45.209> there<00:02:45.450> we<00:02:45.540> go<00:02:47.120> all

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
of these jumps is it there we go all

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.250 
of these jumps is it there we go all
right<00:02:48.360> so<00:02:48.540> gonna<00:02:48.690> find<00:02:49.760> um<00:02:50.930> don't<00:02:51.930> really<00:02:52.110> see

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
right so gonna find um don't really see

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.910 
right so gonna find um don't really see
the<00:02:52.290> point<00:02:52.470> of<00:02:52.770> all<00:02:52.920> this<00:02:53.040> is<00:02:53.220> actually<00:02:54.920> yeah

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
the point of all this is actually yeah

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.110 
the point of all this is actually yeah
and<00:02:55.950> another<00:02:56.400> thing<00:02:56.550> you<00:02:56.880> should<00:02:56.910> probably

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
and another thing you should probably

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.940 
and another thing you should probably
know<00:02:57.330> is<00:02:57.750> that<00:02:57.959> you<00:02:58.050> should<00:02:58.260> almost<00:02:58.590> never

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
know is that you should almost never

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.600 
know is that you should almost never
make<00:02:59.400> an<00:03:00.240> entire<00:03:00.690> level<00:03:00.959> out<00:03:01.170> of<00:03:01.260> blocks<00:03:01.610> let

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
make an entire level out of blocks let

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.160 
make an entire level out of blocks let
me<00:03:02.700> just<00:03:02.820> adjust<00:03:02.940> my<00:03:03.360> microphone<00:03:03.780> here<00:03:03.989> yeah

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
me just adjust my microphone here yeah

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.110 
me just adjust my microphone here yeah
you<00:03:04.980> should<00:03:05.160> almost<00:03:05.310> never<00:03:05.610> make<00:03:05.820> an<00:03:05.910> entire

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
you should almost never make an entire

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.360 
you should almost never make an entire
level<00:03:06.360> out<00:03:06.570> of<00:03:06.660> blocks<00:03:06.870> it<00:03:07.200> just<00:03:07.950> looks<00:03:08.160> bad

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
level out of blocks it just looks bad

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.400 
level out of blocks it just looks bad
and<00:03:08.670> it<00:03:08.790> would<00:03:08.880> look<00:03:09.000> way<00:03:09.300> better<00:03:09.540> if<00:03:09.810> you<00:03:09.959> used

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
and it would look way better if you used

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:18.490 
and it would look way better if you used
actual<00:03:10.769> ground<00:03:15.920> so<00:03:16.920> cut<00:03:17.280> off<00:03:17.430> loading<00:03:18.060> munters

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
actual ground so cut off loading munters

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.710 
actual ground so cut off loading munters
invisible<00:03:19.500> blocks<00:03:19.739> the<00:03:19.920> straps<00:03:22.610> um<00:03:23.610> like<00:03:24.570> see

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
invisible blocks the straps um like see

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.180 
invisible blocks the straps um like see
this<00:03:24.870> is<00:03:25.019> a<00:03:25.050> good<00:03:25.320> way<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:25.470> use<00:03:25.590> invisible

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
this is a good way to use invisible

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.840 
this is a good way to use invisible
blocks<00:03:26.459> there's<00:03:27.120> nothing<00:03:27.420> wrong<00:03:27.570> with<00:03:27.630> this

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
blocks there's nothing wrong with this

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.040 
blocks there's nothing wrong with this
even<00:03:29.850> though<00:03:29.970> it's<00:03:30.150> kind<00:03:30.420> of<00:03:30.480> long<00:03:30.660> and<00:03:30.900> boring

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
even though it's kind of long and boring

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:37.790 
even though it's kind of long and boring
but<00:03:35.660> what<00:03:36.660> is<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:36.989> point<00:03:37.140> of<00:03:37.260> this<00:03:37.320> actually

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
but what is the point of this actually

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:49.800 
but what is the point of this actually
when<00:03:37.920> I<00:03:37.950> could<00:03:38.160> just<00:03:38.310> climb<00:03:38.550> on<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:38.910> thing

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.640 

okay<00:03:50.810> yeah<00:03:51.650> I<00:03:52.270> don't<00:03:53.270> usually<00:03:53.510> comment<00:03:54.350> on

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
okay yeah I don't usually comment on

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.730 
okay yeah I don't usually comment on
like<00:03:54.890> level<00:03:55.340> design<00:03:55.640> normally<00:03:56.480> but<00:03:56.750> you<00:03:57.560> might

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 
like level design normally but you might

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.520 
like level design normally but you might
want<00:03:57.920> to<00:03:58.010> rethink<00:03:58.160> this<00:03:58.460> level<00:03:58.790> because<00:03:58.970> it's

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
want to rethink this level because it's

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.400 
want to rethink this level because it's
kind<00:04:00.530> of<00:04:00.770> boring<00:04:01.580> not<00:04:02.450> gonna<00:04:02.600> lie<00:04:02.780> the<00:04:02.840> vine

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
kind of boring not gonna lie the vine

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.310 
kind of boring not gonna lie the vine
was<00:04:03.620> a<00:04:03.680> lie<00:04:03.920> cool<00:04:04.630> yeah<00:04:05.630> you<00:04:05.690> don't<00:04:06.080> usually

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
was a lie cool yeah you don't usually

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.530 
was a lie cool yeah you don't usually
want<00:04:06.650> to<00:04:06.770> do<00:04:06.890> these<00:04:07.100> either<00:04:07.340> guessing<00:04:08.300> check

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
want to do these either guessing check

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.060 
want to do these either guessing check
paths<00:04:08.840> are<00:04:09.290> never<00:04:09.770> usually<00:04:10.070> a<00:04:10.250> good<00:04:10.490> thing<00:04:10.580> and

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
paths are never usually a good thing and

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.860 
paths are never usually a good thing and
this<00:04:13.070> is<00:04:13.310> more<00:04:13.490> cut<00:04:13.730> off<00:04:13.850> and<00:04:14.180> i<00:04:14.420> can<00:04:14.570> go<00:04:14.690> in<00:04:14.810> the

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
this is more cut off and i can go in the

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:21.280 
this is more cut off and i can go in the
wall<00:04:17.049> yeah<00:04:18.549> so<00:04:19.549> apparently<00:04:19.790> we're<00:04:20.570> gonna<00:04:20.840> do

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
more Quinn block bridge building thing

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.580 
more Quinn block bridge building thing
yeah<00:04:26.419> I<00:04:26.450> said<00:04:26.840> that<00:04:26.870> it's<00:04:27.110> okay<00:04:27.350> to<00:04:27.380> use

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
yeah I said that it's okay to use

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.140 
yeah I said that it's okay to use
climbing<00:04:27.860> blocks<00:04:28.070> like<00:04:28.220> this<00:04:28.250> but<00:04:28.669> when

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
climbing blocks like this but when

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.820 
climbing blocks like this but when
you're<00:04:29.720> like<00:04:29.960> using<00:04:30.710> them<00:04:31.270> so<00:04:32.270> much<00:04:32.680> like<00:04:33.680> it's

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
you're like using them so much like it's

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:40.780 
you're like using them so much like it's
boring<00:04:34.750> what<00:04:35.750> the<00:04:35.840> hell<00:04:36.070> oh<00:04:39.550> yeah<00:04:40.550> and<00:04:40.669> you

might want to give the player a bit more

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.890 
might want to give the player a bit more
time<00:04:42.860> to<00:04:42.890> cuz<00:04:45.070> yeah<00:04:46.090> speed<00:04:47.090> challenges<00:04:47.660> aren't

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
time to cuz yeah speed challenges aren't

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.500
