the<00:00:59.539> line<00:00:59.750> I'm<00:01:00.079> going<00:01:00.589> to<00:01:01.870> increase<00:01:02.870> pressure

00:01:03.099 --> 00:01:03.109 
the line I'm going to increase pressure

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:04.990 
the line I'm going to increase pressure
and<00:01:03.500> then<00:01:03.799> decrease<00:01:04.189> pressure<00:01:04.430> this<00:01:04.820> will

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
and then decrease pressure this will

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.840 
and then decrease pressure this will

time-consuming process but the clean
inks<00:01:19.070> are<00:01:19.640> well<00:01:19.820> worth<00:01:20.030> the<00:01:20.210> effort
