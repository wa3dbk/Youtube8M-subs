00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
think about breakfast by any means and

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.270 
think about breakfast by any means and
it<00:00:39.390> actually<00:00:39.840> sounds<00:00:40.469> kind<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.680> gross<00:00:40.829> unless

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
it actually sounds kind of gross unless

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.650 
it actually sounds kind of gross unless
you<00:00:41.430> think<00:00:41.550> about<00:00:41.820> like<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.300> traditional

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660

you think about like the traditional
breakfast<00:00:43.379> burrito<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.100> then<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.879> start<00:00:45.120> to

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
breakfast burrito and then you start to

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.990 
breakfast burrito and then you start to
think<00:00:45.239> well<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:45.690> makes<00:00:45.870> sense<00:00:46.050> but<00:00:46.890> um<00:00:47.160> it

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
think well that makes sense but um it

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.580 
think well that makes sense but um it
