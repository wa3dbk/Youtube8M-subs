 decided to make a car to compete with the scene the name of this 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:23.429
 client 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.429

 after arrival among the mighty talbiseh is holy the cat 

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:37.829
 the city where the rockets psc created by being whose name is born 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:38.490
 myth 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.920
 the combination of engineering style and high power sum up concept 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.920
 Italians of the true sports cars 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.750
 these images were made in the hometown of the brand's 40th birthday party. 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:53.740
 lan per day 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.810
 it was a memorable event 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:01.640
 in 63 at the company's inauguration what few believed that the adria brand 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.000
 so far 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.149
 the celebration of 2003 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:08.210
 was much bigger because it is the same douro 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.760
 the astrological symbol of the founder 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.920
 the other points of the highway 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.150
 the fans presented their cars on the track 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.120
 good morning performances 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.120
 explain the passion 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.650
 the right product by Islam 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.000
 however, they invaded the streets of the city, creating an impressive 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.830
 Colors 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.920
 in the yard style of italy 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.140
 after allowing the public to enjoy a unique spectacle 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.280
 if we stayed the group with more than 250 vehicles was the place of birth of 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.050
 its course and not by dinei 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.060
 This two-hour trip was the largest 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.740
 the carriage already made 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.740
 I'm super cars 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.689
 these sports were born from the sight of a man 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:00.700
 everything he wanted to direct 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.929
 creator was possible because he 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:07.079
 studied engineering in bologna and World War II served as 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.399
 mechanic for the italian army 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.459
 knowledge about the engines of the allies would be the young entrepreneur a 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.009
 opportunity 

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:20.699
 When he returned home he heard that some motor truck engines 

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:25.929
 British army were for sale he bought and can with the engines 

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:28.929
 to use tractors built by 

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:35.040
 the tractors sold well and in three years the company is designing and riding 

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:36.549
 a new line 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:41.289
 engineering and innovative designs make a company grow 

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:44.569
 ilan burke and was getting richer and 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.669
 of course he wanted to own a hardware 

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:53.269
 but he had some complaints to make about the car 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:58.349
 he was allowed to explain the problems to Mr. Ferrario who 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:59.830
 answered something like 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.430
 What do you know about building cars you make tractors for living 

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:07.659
 Then a duel began. 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:11.360
 not because he decided that if they screwed up he would not listen to their ideas 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.360
 he would build his own car 

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:17.869
 dismantled his tools to see what could improve 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:23.530
 and found that some parts of his car were the same ones he used in 

00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:24.959
 tractors 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.460
 but it is evident that the piece cost three times more 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.879
 when placed in a high standard car 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:35.139
 he realized that he would have much more profit with sports cars 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.810
 set up a modern factory and started working on his first car 

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:43.770
 in 1963 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.759
 he presented a car of d 

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:48.989
 I do not sleep every Sunday game. 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.929
 the project was not very well received 

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:57.329
 but in show of gea granddaughter in 64 not because he introduced me the first model 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:01.439
 which would be produced in series the 350 gt 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:06.439
 was a car superior to the one that the blacksmith offered of the time 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:09.029
 successor immediately 

00:04:09.029 --> 00:04:12.489
 finally came a car to challenge the truth 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.489
 both in style and performance 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.079
 one of the advantages is not because they would grant granting power with smoothness 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:26.720
 in tests at more than 225 miles per hour the cars were applauded 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:34.180
 the 350 gt was a phenomenon of criticism winning praise in the press 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.310
 after all, it met all the demands of rich customers who wanted something 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.220
 silent fast 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.449
 different 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:48.740
 in a moment what we said when you give the second part of the 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.050
 history of this brand italy in the powerful there a piggy
