00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 hello together today i want one 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:10.250
 scrambled eggs cook on low fat art to 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:17.820
 I need a coated pan 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:25.369
 a woodpile a bowl of pepper 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:33.540
 and salt a whisk of two 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:38.910
 chive and a knife first 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:44.700
 I beat the eggs while removing them 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:47.510
 the hakel students that is not always possible 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.510
 very easily 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.010
 sometimes someone slips through it 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:03.840
 I will return later with the spoon 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:09.150
 out now the eggs are easily stirred 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:13.909
 and that nice sooner than later 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:18.229
 I'll give you two more 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.229
 teaspoon of water 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:28.860
 I hear that again beautifully and then 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.100
 I cut the chives into small ones 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.100
 roll 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:52.330
 more 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:56.080
 I admit it now and stir it slowly 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.080
 carefully 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.580
 I slowly heated the pan and 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.330
 check with a few drops of water 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.330
 temperature before I now the egg mass 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.330
 these 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:25.590
 I let the 1 1 little falter and 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.170
 stir it slowly in the pan 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:32.190
 and forth 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:35.840
 that lasts a while now is the 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:39.030
 desired consistency is achieved 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.390
 Personally, I do not like it that much 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:46.500
 when it is so dry 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:50.060
 that's why it's done now, and me 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.060
 then take it from the fire 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.450
 I direct the stir on a plate 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.450
 then I would still salt it 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:28.260
 and a little bit of pepper and who likes 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:30.920
 to take a roll and see 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.920
 the whole thing out
