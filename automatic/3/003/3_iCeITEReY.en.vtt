00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
to week

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.710 
to week
the<00:04:30.790> braking<00:04:31.240> system<00:04:31.420> is<00:04:31.990> too<00:04:32.290> freakin<00:04:32.860> weak

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
the braking system is too freakin weak

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.010 
the braking system is too freakin weak
that's<00:04:34.720> what<00:04:35.110> not<00:04:35.380> I<00:04:35.410> like<00:04:35.770> about<00:04:36.100> this<00:04:36.280> fight

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
that's what not I like about this fight

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.600 
that's what not I like about this fight
but<00:04:38.020> you<00:04:38.170> know<00:04:38.230> if<00:04:38.320> you<00:04:38.470> have<00:04:38.620> money<00:04:38.890> extra

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
money in your pocket go get a Brembo

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.000 
money in your pocket go get a Brembo
braking<00:04:44.260> system

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
braking system

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:50.430 
braking system
you<00:04:45.670> know<00:04:45.820> customize<00:04:46.540> it<00:04:48.390> but<00:04:49.390> the<00:04:50.110> start

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
you know customize it but the start

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:56.910 
you know customize it but the start
braking<00:04:51.130> system<00:04:51.610> is<00:04:52.350> a<00:04:53.350> piece<00:04:53.560> of<00:04:54.030> trash<00:04:55.920> the

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:56.920 
braking system is a piece of trash the

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.980 
braking system is a piece of trash the
braking<00:04:57.340> system<00:04:57.460> is<00:04:57.790> we<00:04:59.520> also<00:05:00.630> another<00:05:01.630> thing

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
braking system is we also another thing

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.760 
braking system is we also another thing
that<00:05:02.160> I<00:05:03.160> don't<00:05:03.370> like<00:05:03.670> about<00:05:04.060> this<00:05:04.240> bike<00:05:04.770> here

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
that I don't like about this bike here

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:11.840 
that I don't like about this bike here
let<00:05:05.980> me<00:05:06.010> show<00:05:06.100> you

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:26.640 

let<00:05:12.840> me<00:05:13.050> move<00:05:13.740> forward<00:05:14.220> the<00:05:14.340> bike

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.050 

you<00:05:27.190> see<00:05:27.400> here<00:05:27.990> the<00:05:28.990> instrumentation<00:05:30.060> is

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
you see here the instrumentation is

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.870 
you see here the instrumentation is
weird<00:05:32.910> the<00:05:33.910> speedometer<00:05:34.660> is<00:05:34.870> analog<00:05:35.699> but<00:05:36.699> the

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
weird the speedometer is analog but the

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.770 
weird the speedometer is analog but the
RPM<00:05:37.449> is<00:05:37.780> digital<00:05:38.820> you<00:05:39.820> know<00:05:39.970> what<00:05:40.210> it<00:05:40.570> should

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
RPM is digital you know what it should

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.830 
RPM is digital you know what it should
be<00:05:40.810> the<00:05:41.050> other<00:05:41.080> way<00:05:41.320> around<00:05:42.479> let<00:05:43.479> me<00:05:43.509> show<00:05:43.810> it

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
be the other way around let me show it

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:54.090 
be the other way around let me show it
to<00:05:43.990> you<00:05:44.110> guys

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.100 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.110 

Oh

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.940 

this<00:05:56.570> is<00:05:56.750> the<00:05:56.960> RPM<00:05:57.970> instrumentation

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:00.950 
this is the RPM instrumentation

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:09.260 
this is the RPM instrumentation
digital<00:06:03.410> speedometer<00:06:07.850> it<00:06:08.850> should<00:06:09.030> be<00:06:09.210> the

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
digital speedometer it should be the

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:15.700 
digital speedometer it should be the
other<00:06:09.420> way<00:06:09.810> around

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.710 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:22.070 

so<00:06:19.069> that's<00:06:20.069> another<00:06:20.699> thing<00:06:20.900> that<00:06:21.900> I<00:06:22.020> don't

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 
so that's another thing that I don't

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.370 
so that's another thing that I don't
like<00:06:22.349> about<00:06:23.250> this<00:06:23.430> fight

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.380 
like about this fight

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:29.780 
like about this fight
so<00:06:26.240> three<00:06:27.240> things<00:06:27.510> I<00:06:28.190> wish<00:06:29.190> the<00:06:29.430> braking

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:29.790 
so three things I wish the braking

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.800 
so three things I wish the braking
system<00:06:29.970> is<00:06:30.420> good

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:32.810 
system is good

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.340 
system is good
unfortunately<00:06:33.810> it's<00:06:34.590> bad<00:06:36.350> the

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:37.350 
unfortunately it's bad the

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:43.010 
unfortunately it's bad the
instrumentation<00:06:37.950> is<00:06:38.430> weird<00:06:39.470> and<00:06:40.470> I<00:06:42.020> hope

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.020 
instrumentation is weird and I hope

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:47.470 
instrumentation is weird and I hope
there's<00:06:43.680> a<00:06:43.740> windshield<00:06:45.290> for<00:06:46.290> this<00:06:46.470> fight

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:47.480 
there's a windshield for this fight

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.620 
there's a windshield for this fight
because<00:06:48.480> I<00:06:48.780> couldn't<00:06:49.620> find<00:06:49.920> one<00:06:50.130> I<00:06:50.630> am

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:51.630 
because I couldn't find one I am

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.180 
because I couldn't find one I am
searching<00:06:51.900> on<00:06:52.230> the<00:06:52.350> Internet

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:53.190

you know I'm I just wish I could find a
vision<00:06:56.520> for<00:06:56.880> this<00:06:57.030> bike<00:06:57.590> but<00:06:58.590> I<00:06:58.970> couldn't<00:06:59.970> find

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:00.090 
vision for this bike but I couldn't find

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.950 
vision for this bike but I couldn't find
any<00:07:01.220> because<00:07:02.220> you<00:07:02.520> know<00:07:02.610> it<00:07:02.730> will<00:07:02.910> be<00:07:03.150> more

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:03.960

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:07.290 
very convenient for me if there's a

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:11.180 
very convenient for me if there's a
windshield<00:07:08.600> especially<00:07:09.600> I<00:07:09.950> ride<00:07:10.950> on<00:07:10.980> the

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:11.190 
windshield especially I ride on the

windshield especially I ride on the
freeway<00:07:11.610> most<00:07:12.480> of<00:07:12.630> the<00:07:12.750> time<00:07:12.990> before<00:07:13.590> I<00:07:13.830> go<00:07:14.100> hit

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:14.520 
freeway most of the time before I go hit

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:20.210 
freeway most of the time before I go hit
the<00:07:14.700> onions<00:07:16.610> so<00:07:18.050> but

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:20.220

apart<00:07:20.910> from<00:07:21.090> those<00:07:21.420> three<00:07:22.320> cons<00:07:22.680> that<00:07:23.220> I<00:07:23.250> just

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:23.610 
apart from those three cons that I just

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:29.620 
apart from those three cons that I just
mentioned<00:07:24.590> the<00:07:25.590> whole<00:07:25.800> bike<00:07:27.140> is<00:07:28.140> perfect

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:29.630 
mentioned the whole bike is perfect

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:33.920 
mentioned the whole bike is perfect
you<00:07:30.630> see<00:07:31.040> it's<00:07:32.040> not<00:07:32.250> too<00:07:32.310> long<00:07:32.790> it's<00:07:33.510> not<00:07:33.630> too

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:33.930
