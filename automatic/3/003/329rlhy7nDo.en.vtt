other two bits

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.710 
other two bits
well<00:00:26.340> actually<00:00:26.609> Nick<00:00:26.910> furious<00:00:27.359> we<00:00:27.510> like<00:00:27.630> it's

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
well actually Nick furious we like it's

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.670 
well actually Nick furious we like it's
meant<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:27.900> be<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.019> part<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.349> sport<00:00:28.500> as<00:00:28.650> well

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
meant to be a part of the sport as well

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.490 
meant to be a part of the sport as well
so<00:00:29.429> there's<00:00:29.730> not<00:00:29.910> number<00:00:30.240> one<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:30.689> but<00:00:31.320> as

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
so there's not number one to this but as

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.500 
so there's not number one to this but as
you<00:00:31.590> can<00:00:31.679> see<00:00:31.740> we've<00:00:31.949> got<00:00:32.009> venom<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.149> reason

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
you can see we've got venom and a reason

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.760 
you can see we've got venom and a reason
if<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:33.989> see<00:00:34.170> here<00:00:34.350> he's<00:00:34.440> got<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:34.680> was

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
if you see here he's got it was

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.370 
if you see here he's got it was
spider-man<00:00:35.100> sign<00:00:35.460> now<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.480> think<00:00:36.660> this<00:00:37.020> means

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
spider-man sign now I think this means

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.139 
spider-man sign now I think this means
that<00:00:37.980> these<00:00:38.309> characters<00:00:38.790> are<00:00:38.820> playing

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
that these characters are playing

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.540 
that these characters are playing
spider-man's<00:00:39.719> worlds<00:00:40.170> so<00:00:40.860> that's<00:00:41.340> what<00:00:41.460> I'm

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
spider-man's worlds so that's what I'm

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.860 
spider-man's worlds so that's what I'm
assuming<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.000> Fink's<00:00:42.360> that's<00:00:42.719> all<00:00:42.809> I'm

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
assuming it Fink's that's all I'm

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.479 
assuming it Fink's that's all I'm
assuming<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.710> must<00:00:44.010> be<00:00:44.129> because<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.370> won't

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
assuming is it must be because it won't

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.440 
assuming is it must be because it won't
have<00:00:44.520> spider-man<00:00:44.940> as<00:00:45.030> world<00:00:45.180> if<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.360> was

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
have spider-man as world if it was

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.720 
have spider-man as world if it was
sunday<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:46.500> we've<00:00:46.649> got<00:00:46.770> some<00:00:46.920> iron<00:00:47.219> fist<00:00:47.489> here

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
sunday and we've got some iron fist here

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.979 
sunday and we've got some iron fist here
