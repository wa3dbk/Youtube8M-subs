00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
um so this is my lego Huey and strangely

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.600 
um so this is my lego Huey and strangely
enough<00:00:08.670> it's<00:00:09.030> orange<00:00:09.769> yes<00:00:10.769> I<00:00:10.980> kind<00:00:11.219> of<00:00:11.280> made<00:00:11.490> it

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
enough it's orange yes I kind of made it

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.240

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
newscaster sqe so this is pretty much

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.960 
newscaster sqe so this is pretty much
column<00:00:22.039> this<00:00:23.039> is<00:00:23.189> pretty<00:00:23.369> much<00:00:23.460> what<00:00:23.580> it<00:00:23.789> looks

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
column this is pretty much what it looks

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.290 
column this is pretty much what it looks
like<00:00:24.150> I<00:00:24.859> tried<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:25.980> out<00:00:26.099> with<00:00:26.460> wheels<00:00:26.760> but<00:00:27.150> the

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
like I tried it out with wheels but the

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.609 
like I tried it out with wheels but the
skids<00:00:27.599> just<00:00:27.900> look<00:00:28.080> so<00:00:28.260> much<00:00:28.380> better<00:00:28.760> um<00:00:30.619> it's

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
skids just look so much better um it's

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.220 
skids just look so much better um it's
got<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.279> propeller<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:33.690> only<00:00:33.870> thing<00:00:34.050> that

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
got the propeller the only thing that

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.280 
got the propeller the only thing that
doesn't<00:00:34.500> have<00:00:34.710> brought<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.070> propeller

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
doesn't have brought the propeller

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.660 
doesn't have brought the propeller
things<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.500> make<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.770> propeller<00:00:37.980> rotate

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
things that make the propeller rotate

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.280 
things that make the propeller rotate
from<00:00:38.940> like<00:00:39.180> up<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.600> down<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.840> things<00:00:40.170> like

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
from like up and down and things like

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.979 
from like up and down and things like
that<00:00:40.350> aren't<00:00:41.250> there<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.820> can<00:00:42.600> work<00:00:42.750> on<00:00:42.930> that

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
that aren't there I can work on that

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.630 
that aren't there I can work on that
you're<00:00:43.469> probably<00:00:43.680> going<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.010> be<00:00:44.100> updating

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
you're probably going to be updating

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.459 
you're probably going to be updating
this<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:45.660> enough<00:00:46.430> nose<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.969> very<00:00:48.629> nice<00:00:49.410> for

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
this so enough nose is very nice for

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.400 
this so enough nose is very nice for
Huey<00:00:50.239> it's<00:00:51.239> really<00:00:51.570> hard<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.870> get<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.110> Huey's

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
Huey it's really hard to get the Huey's

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.500 
Huey it's really hard to get the Huey's
nose<00:00:52.620> but<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:52.980> came<00:00:53.699> up<00:00:53.850> with<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:54.030> technique<00:00:54.300> that

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
nose but I came up with a technique that

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.970 
nose but I came up with a technique that
works<00:00:55.469> really<00:00:56.039> well<00:00:56.190> ah<00:00:57.620> yeah<00:00:58.620> it's<00:00:58.800> pretty

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
works really well ah yeah it's pretty

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.080 
works really well ah yeah it's pretty
blocky<00:00:59.399> but<00:00:59.789> I<00:01:00.000> kind<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.420> like<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:01.579> that<00:01:02.579> slit

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
blocky but I kind of like that that slit

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.140 
blocky but I kind of like that that slit
I<00:01:03.329> thought<00:01:03.750> would<00:01:03.899> just<00:01:04.140> be<00:01:04.290> kind<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.680> like<00:01:04.890> a

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
I thought would just be kind of like a

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.390 
I thought would just be kind of like a
good<00:01:06.150> looking<00:01:06.510> thing<00:01:06.750> for<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.740> Huey<00:01:07.920> Anna<00:01:08.159> had

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
good looking thing for the Huey Anna had

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.300 
good looking thing for the Huey Anna had
a<00:01:08.430> lot<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.670> pieces<00:01:08.970> like<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.920> to<00:01:10.920> exhaust

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
a lot of pieces like that to exhaust

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.620 
a lot of pieces like that to exhaust
ports<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.600> engines<00:01:13.080> right<00:01:13.409> there<00:01:14.630> the

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
ports of the engines right there the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.590 
ports of the engines right there the
slope<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.880> another<00:01:17.880> cool<00:01:18.090> feature<00:01:18.119> that's

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
slope and another cool feature that's

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.210 
slope and another cool feature that's
very<00:01:18.840> realistic<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:20.280> back<00:01:20.520> fold<00:01:21.229> like<00:01:22.229> the

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
very realistic is the back fold like the

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.399 
very realistic is the back fold like the
real<00:01:23.400> ones<00:01:23.700> will<00:01:24.390> some<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.840> real<00:01:24.990> ones<00:01:25.200> not

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
real ones will some of the real ones not

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.990 
real ones will some of the real ones not
the<00:01:26.009> military<00:01:26.580> ones<00:01:26.900> hey<00:01:28.579> this<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.880> only

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
the military ones hey this is the only

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.569

strange thing you have to take the

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:39.080 
strange thing you have to take the
propeller<00:01:32.939> after<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.540> fold<00:01:33.869> well<00:01:37.880> ok<00:01:38.880> there<00:01:39.030> we

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090
