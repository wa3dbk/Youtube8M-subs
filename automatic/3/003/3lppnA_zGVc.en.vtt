00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.819
 I welcome dear not so long ago, I 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.910
 did a review on the headphones akg game 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.330
 y 40 some kind of urban everyday 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.340
 option 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.769
 and today I suggest you look at 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.940
 his evolution on his older brother under 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.279
 y 45 bts except receiving 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.380
 five to the number of headphones got 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.119
 possibility that it is logical from the name 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.849
 connect via bluetooth 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.980
 they are only on cable but there is one more 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.960
 quite an interesting difference that i 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.559
 you today and tell you more 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.020
 let's go despite the fact that before us 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:38.550
 full bluetooth headset 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.829
 pretty compact thing 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.399
 neat little and if you look 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.860
 on her 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.649
 especially if a cable is connected 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.739
 you think that in front of you just 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:52.590
 the younger version called y 40 is 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.960
 one to one same here please 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.610
 not to be unsubstantiated differ in 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.870
 In this case, they are only in color. 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.030
 solutions up 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.550
 review of the 40 tower I also have on the channel 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.150
 so go and see for sure 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.610
 but we continue here, of course, as well as 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.729
 40 towers used different materials 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.869
 here and matte plastic there and here 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.400
 here is silver plastic and something like 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:20.159
 silicone or plastic what is 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.400
 mediocre this is all headband of anger 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:27.150
 and skin young dermantina from the inside the essence 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.640
 PVC, and the same skin here now that we are here 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.470
 would rustle and some kind of artificial rag 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.090
 which is actually cooking and opens 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.890
 the sound of the passage of the cup is also minimized 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.829
 pretty compact solution you can 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.229
 put them even in some jacket in 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.340
 pocket they just fit well into the bag I'm already 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.710
 definitely keep silent they obviously fit 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.659
 on control bodies that is on one 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.180
 practically nothing of the cups 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.840
 charger and small LED 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.740
 notifications while on another cup 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.840
 focused almost everything 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.270
 what we see here is a microphone like this 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.829
 Here is the mesh covered on the button 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.009
 on-off 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:12.180
 here is the notification indicator which 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:15.780
 says already that they call you 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.880
 input is two and a half millimeter stereo and 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.860
 volume control plus answer hang up 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.810
 plus it's a universal button for 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.830
 rewind tracks i.e. clicked twice 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.580
 forward 3 times back ergonomically say 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.120
 later on 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.370
 now I will show you how widely you can 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.769
 stretch the headband well, pretty 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.080
 wide although it is pretty tight and 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.940
 so on some already marginal 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.760
 values ​​will be completely uncomfortable on 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:46.390
 normal head she nalezaet nalezaet 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.819
 not bad well and if you are really 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.100
 such owners of a large vat can 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.850
 be if you wear a little bit 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.340
 uncomfortable 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.580
 so here it all looks on real 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.319
 the person in the face of me is in front like this 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.690
 here respectively the side 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.910
 if you shake your head and even very much 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.890
 all the same you will not fall from her head 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.019
 it's a good indicator you can even 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.160
 run in these headphones no problem 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.070
 will not experience 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.620
 Well dear let's let it down 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.650
 results in terms of working time 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.359
 stated at 8:00 am get seven hours from 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.100
 penny basically normal 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:22.480
 indicator 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.579
 naturally it all depends on how you 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.549
 listen that is how loud how often 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:29.440
 switch what and of course how 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.030
 you often talk about this 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.420
 headphone and headset 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:37.209
 further conclusions will be built in two parts 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.100
 breaking the first part of it directly 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:42.459
 headphones and music the second part is 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:45.250
 headset and microphone headphones and music 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.470
 after all, it is the successor of the y series 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.209
 so the classic plug is present 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.579
 in the eyes and that is, the bottom raised up 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:55.239
 the middle is raised a little failed 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:58.200
 if we connect via bluetooth then we see 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:02.170
 quite so flabby flabby bottom very 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.170
 thick deep what ailing swirling 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.960
 as a country house as a jellyfish cast ashore 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.790
 hanging out 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:11.030
 Here is such a sound in his bass 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.530
 it turns out the top is also not showing 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.240
 something interesting because 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.590
 resembles plastic bags Sasha on 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.770
 instead of plates wants chic-chic-chic-chic 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:21.530
 there is almost no unpleasant sound either 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:23.540
 but as soon as you plug in the cable sound 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.090
 completely transformed very well 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.640
 big difference gets you more 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.380
 collected more accentuated it 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.570
 less it does not become so 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.720
 hyper tambourine which he, of course, is also very 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.890
 powerful very deep but nonetheless its 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.440
 getting smaller 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.840
 emerges from oblivion the middle and 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.550
 the tip is getting normal 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.490
 dishes like this why 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.710
 such a difference I honestly do not know yes 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.870
 of course if you want to listen 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.510
 if you please connect to 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.160
 cable cable has a connector with one 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.590
 three and a half jacks on the other 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.290
 hand two and a half jack if 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:03.140
 torn then go or somewhere looking for a new 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:05.660
 or go to the radio market to buy and 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.970
 solder yourself a replacement for nothing complicated 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.430
 it is not but nevertheless it is some 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.930
 inconvenience because jack three with 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.600
 half to three and a half lies 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:17.900
 almost everywhere 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:20.030
 further there is an nfc connection 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.610
 if you want attached right there 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:25.510
 connected yes it is convenient it in general 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.950
 modern and is considered the norm 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:30.830
 now let's talk like her 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:33.770
 allows you to communicate in terms of 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.810
 headset no problem no throw in 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:38.180
 bag hang it somewhere behind 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:40.760
 shoulder and go quietly rustling or not 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.190
 indoor noise unfortunately somewhere 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.620
 five meters if you put it in 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:48.200
 the room went around the corner all somewhere meters 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:50.270
 five and so it turns out four 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.920
 maybe even begin hissing w 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:55.910
 seething already there are some defects 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:58.550
 on line for voice quality 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:01.940
 they say it's a bit deaf 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:04.280
 but nonetheless completely comparable to 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:08.120
 many many headsets that is 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:10.010
 the difference is small in quality of work on 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.590
 the wind is fine with us all the same 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:15.110
 Petersburg is a lot of wind 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:17.480
 constantly but people still hear 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.390
 this wind was never asked again 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.250
 all the time 

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:23.190
 and calmly communicated with me 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:24.210
 they said yes everything is perfectly audible now 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.730
 on ergonomics 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:29.910
 with ergonomics here trouble sad because 

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:32.610
 that the buttons are small I am the first stage 2 days 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:33.900
 constantly turned it off getting a finger 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.420
 off button 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:38.550
 then of course to adapt but not 

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:40.380
 less this is not a comfortable headset with a point 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:42.960
 In view of blind control, I am silent about 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:44.910
 gloves there it is generally impossible here 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.400
 then an ordinary finger has to be there somewhere 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:49.830
 here to look for a shit 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:52.590
 fit your finger correctly so that it hits 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:53.850
 for example on adjusting the volume they are on 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:56.040
 talk off 

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:57.810
 so here is such a feature therefore 

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.720
 be sure to listen to the rest 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:03.810
 quite comfortable in principle if you 

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:06.240
 the head is very big it can crush but 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:09.110
 if you have it standard then only 

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:11.460
 very long use and 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:13.650
 I promised to tell the little chip in 

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:17.160
 what's the difference oddly enough 

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:20.400
 same headphone same diameter in 

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:25.320
 these emitters but it sounds this is the most 

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:26.910
 bt 45 is better than usual y 40 more 

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.680
 interesting more delicious sound 

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:32.010
 naturally we are talking about cable 

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:34.710
 connection here such conclusions will be 

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:37.170
 Be sure to listen before you buy for 

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:39.750
 I can't advise my eyes yet 

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:42.630
 unambiguous thing specific if you 

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:43.890
 love smooth and clear and beautiful and easy 

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:46.980
 clear sound 

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:49.080
 it is still better to be safe all 

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.830
 for today everything i say goodbye to you but 

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:54.260
 briefly 

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:54.260
 for soon there will be new reviews for now
