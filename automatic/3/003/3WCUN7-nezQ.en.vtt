the<00:00:03.240> most<00:00:03.449> important<00:00:03.929> thing<00:00:04.140> when<00:00:04.319> you're

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
the most important thing when you're

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.990 
the most important thing when you're
setting<00:00:04.680> your<00:00:04.710> rollers<00:00:05.130> up<00:00:05.279> is<00:00:05.430> to<00:00:05.580> find<00:00:05.819> a

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
setting your rollers up is to find a

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.390 
setting your rollers up is to find a
really<00:00:06.480> flat<00:00:06.779> smooth<00:00:07.140> surface<00:00:07.220> make<00:00:08.220> sure

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
really flat smooth surface make sure

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.799 
really flat smooth surface make sure
that<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:08.730> rollers<00:00:09.030> are<00:00:09.150> not<00:00:09.269> moving<00:00:09.480> next

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
that the rollers are not moving next

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.120 
that the rollers are not moving next
thing<00:00:10.050> that<00:00:10.080> you<00:00:10.260> have<00:00:10.380> to<00:00:10.500> look<00:00:10.650> at<00:00:10.830> is<00:00:10.980> the

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
thing that you have to look at is the

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.860 
thing that you have to look at is the
length<00:00:11.280> of<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.610> rollers<00:00:11.910> that<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.630> correct

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
length of the rollers that the correct

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.010 
length of the rollers that the correct
length<00:00:13.110> will<00:00:13.380> be<00:00:13.500> a<00:00:13.530> little<00:00:13.830> bit<00:00:13.950> longer<00:00:15.020> than

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
length will be a little bit longer than

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.599 
length will be a little bit longer than
the<00:00:16.139> front<00:00:16.320> axle<00:00:16.770> so<00:00:16.980> if<00:00:17.039> you've<00:00:17.160> got<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.430> bike

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
the front axle so if you've got the bike

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.580 
the front axle so if you've got the bike
on<00:00:17.789> like<00:00:17.970> this<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.449> here's<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:18.990> front<00:00:19.230> axle

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
on like this and here's the front axle

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.990 
on like this and here's the front axle
you<00:00:19.830> want<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.070> rollers<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.490> be<00:00:20.609> just<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.910> little

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
you want the rollers to be just a little

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.330 
you want the rollers to be just a little
bit<00:00:21.180> longer<00:00:21.420> well<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.439> most<00:00:22.590> important<00:00:23.130> thing

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
bit longer well the most important thing

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.380 
bit longer well the most important thing
when<00:00:23.519> you're<00:00:23.640> learning<00:00:23.789> is<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.210> make<00:00:24.359> sure

side of you whether it be a friend on
either<00:00:28.500> side<00:00:28.859> or<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:29.130> doorway<00:00:29.550> is<00:00:29.730> really

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
either side or a doorway is really

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.490 
either side or a doorway is really
useful<00:00:30.510> because<00:00:30.630> if<00:00:30.929> you've<00:00:31.050> got<00:00:31.080> your<00:00:31.349> bike

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
useful because if you've got your bike

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.319 
useful because if you've got your bike
in<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.740> doorway<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.610> can<00:00:32.759> keep<00:00:32.940> your<00:00:33.120> hands

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
in the doorway you can keep your hands

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
shoulders so doorway is the most ideal

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.850 
shoulders so doorway is the most ideal
otherwise<00:00:39.510> two<00:00:40.020> things<00:00:40.290> on<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.530> other<00:00:40.649> side

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
otherwise two things on the other side

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.520 
otherwise two things on the other side
like<00:00:41.070> chairs<00:00:41.430> are<00:00:41.610> very<00:00:41.760> handy<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:43.079> process

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
like chairs are very handy the process

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.799 
like chairs are very handy the process
of<00:00:43.710> getting<00:00:44.640> onto<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.120> rollers<00:00:45.420> first<00:00:45.660> to

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
of getting onto the rollers first to

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.690 
of getting onto the rollers first to
check<00:00:45.989> what<00:00:46.200> gear<00:00:46.410> you're<00:00:46.620> in<00:00:46.649> anywhere<00:00:47.250> in

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
check what gear you're in anywhere in

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.459 
check what gear you're in anywhere in
the<00:00:47.820> middle<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.329> arena<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.930> cassette<00:00:49.320> is

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
the middle of the arena the cassette is

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.430 
the middle of the arena the cassette is
the<00:00:49.590> best<00:00:49.800> place<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.399> be<00:00:50.780> in<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.899> big<00:00:52.079> ring<00:00:52.289> or

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
the best place to be in the big ring or

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.660 
the best place to be in the big ring or
the<00:00:52.469> little<00:00:52.770> ring<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.039> doesn't<00:00:53.309> really<00:00:53.430> matter

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
the little ring it doesn't really matter

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.520 
the little ring it doesn't really matter
but<00:00:53.850> not<00:00:54.000> too<00:00:54.210> easy<00:00:54.360> not<00:00:54.719> too<00:00:54.870> hard<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.320> if<00:00:55.379> I'm

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
but not too easy not too hard so if I'm

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.840 
but not too easy not too hard so if I'm
one<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.770> those<00:00:55.829> skiers<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.399> middle<00:00:56.670> and

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
one of those skiers in the middle and

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.630 
one of those skiers in the middle and
then<00:00:57.800> it's<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.920> little<00:00:59.160> bit<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.399> tricky

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
then it's a little bit of a tricky

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.279 
then it's a little bit of a tricky
process<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.239> get<00:01:00.359> on<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.539> rollers<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:01.020> always

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
process to get on the rollers I always

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.280 
process to get on the rollers I always
put<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.739> pedal<00:01:02.340> at<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.579> bottom<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.149> put<00:01:04.019> put

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
put the pedal at the bottom and put put

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.530 
put the pedal at the bottom and put put
the<00:01:04.350> first<00:01:04.619> foot<00:01:05.369> into<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.820> pedal<00:01:06.000> here<00:01:06.330> and

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
the first foot into the pedal here and

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.510 
the first foot into the pedal here and
then<00:01:07.290> it's<00:01:07.439> all<00:01:07.590> about<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:08.040> angle<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.460> the

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
then it's all about the angle and the

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.880 
then it's all about the angle and the
balancing<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.119> bike<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.229> use<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:10.619> hip

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
balancing of the bike so I use this hip

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.480 
balancing of the bike so I use this hip
to<00:01:11.640> rest<00:01:12.150> on<00:01:12.330> my<00:01:12.479> seat<00:01:13.110> like<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.490> something

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
to rest on my seat like that something

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.170 
to rest on my seat like that something
close<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.210> just<00:01:15.259> clip<00:01:16.259> in<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.710> use<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.310> try

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
close and just clip in and use the try

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.390 
close and just clip in and use the try
not<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.509> keep<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.930> bike<00:01:19.080> upright<00:01:19.350> just<00:01:19.860> let<00:01:20.280> it

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
not to keep the bike upright just let it

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.730 
not to keep the bike upright just let it
go<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.030> angle<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.200> feels<00:01:22.590> most

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
go in the angle that feels most

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.320 
go in the angle that feels most
comfortable<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.430> then<00:01:23.640> swing<00:01:23.909> your<00:01:23.939> leg<00:01:24.210> over

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
comfortable and then swing your leg over

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.980 
comfortable and then swing your leg over
like<00:01:24.540> that

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
like that

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.749 
like that
so<00:01:25.350> once<00:01:25.560> you've<00:01:25.740> clipped<00:01:26.009> both<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.430> your<00:01:26.549> feet

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
so once you've clipped both of your feet

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.340 
so once you've clipped both of your feet
into<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.150> pedals<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.600> you're<00:01:27.750> holding<00:01:28.080> on<00:01:28.200> to

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
into the pedals and you're holding on to

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.050 
into the pedals and you're holding on to
something<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:29.130> might<00:01:29.280> be<00:01:29.460> in<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.640> doorway<00:01:29.850> so

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
something you might be in a doorway so

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.670 
something you might be in a doorway so
you<00:01:30.329> can<00:01:30.479> lean<00:01:30.659> your<00:01:30.810> shoulders<00:01:31.200> against<00:01:31.470> the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
you can lean your shoulders against the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.350 
you can lean your shoulders against the
doorway<00:01:31.890> but<00:01:32.280> if<00:01:32.670> you're<00:01:32.790> holding<00:01:33.030> onto<00:01:33.210> the

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
doorway but if you're holding onto the

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.819 
doorway but if you're holding onto the
stool<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.659> first<00:01:33.990> thing<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.530> look<00:01:34.650> one

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
stool the first thing is to look one

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.350 
stool the first thing is to look one
meter<00:01:35.040> front<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.790> just<00:01:35.880> remember

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
meter front of you and just remember

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.940 
meter front of you and just remember
that<00:01:36.509> this<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:36.960> probably<00:01:37.259> three<00:01:37.590> things<00:01:37.829> to

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
that this is probably three things to

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.530 
that this is probably three things to
remember<00:01:38.130> that's<00:01:38.400> look<00:01:38.880> one<00:01:39.090> meter<00:01:39.299> in<00:01:39.479> front

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
remember that's look one meter in front

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.179 
remember that's look one meter in front
of<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:39.960> keep<00:01:40.290> your<00:01:40.439> hands<00:01:40.650> loose<00:01:40.920> on<00:01:41.070> the

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
of you keep your hands loose on the

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.219 
of you keep your hands loose on the
handlebars<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.970> keep<00:01:42.540> pushing<00:01:42.810> on<00:01:43.110> the

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
handlebars and keep pushing on the

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.569 
handlebars and keep pushing on the
pedals<00:01:43.560> because<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:43.979> moment<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.310> take<00:01:44.430> the

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
pedals because the moment you take the

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.219 
pedals because the moment you take the
pressure<00:01:44.729> off<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.030> pedals<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:46.049> wheel

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
pressure off the pedals that the wheel

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.270 
pressure off the pedals that the wheel
starts<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.680> move<00:01:46.829> like<00:01:47.040> that

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
starts to move like that

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.639 
starts to move like that
so<00:01:47.729> look<00:01:47.880> one<00:01:48.090> meter<00:01:48.299> in<00:01:48.479> front<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:48.990> push

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
so look one meter in front of you push

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.319 
so look one meter in front of you push
through<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:49.979> through<00:01:50.250> your<00:01:50.430> hips<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.970> keep

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
through it through your hips and keep

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.260 
through it through your hips and keep
your<00:01:51.509> hands<00:01:51.689> really

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
your hands really

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.069 
your hands really
on<00:01:52.390> the<00:01:52.509> handlebars<00:01:53.049> try<00:01:53.950> not<00:01:54.130> to<00:01:54.159> steer<00:01:55.079> the

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
on the handlebars try not to steer the

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:57.300 
on the handlebars try not to steer the
first<00:01:56.380> thing<00:01:56.590> you're<00:01:56.740> going<00:01:56.920> to<00:01:57.070> feel<00:01:57.280> when

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
first thing you're going to feel when

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.800 
first thing you're going to feel when
you<00:01:57.520> start<00:01:57.850> to<00:01:57.969> pedal<00:01:58.179> is<00:01:58.420> that<00:01:58.659> the

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
you start to pedal is that the

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.240 
you start to pedal is that the
handlebars<00:01:59.170> and<00:01:59.439> the<00:01:59.649> wheel<00:01:59.829> is<00:02:00.039> going

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
handlebars and the wheel is going

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.100 
handlebars and the wheel is going
everywhere<00:02:00.670> over<00:02:00.850> the<00:02:01.060> rollers<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:01.869> more

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
everywhere over the rollers the more

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.810 
everywhere over the rollers the more
harder<00:02:02.619> you<00:02:02.710> push<00:02:02.890> on<00:02:03.070> the<00:02:03.159> pedal<00:02:03.460> some<00:02:03.670> more

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
harder you push on the pedal some more

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.389 
harder you push on the pedal some more
that'll<00:02:04.030> start<00:02:04.479> to<00:02:04.659> go<00:02:04.780> straight<00:02:05.130> so<00:02:06.130> just

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
that'll start to go straight so just

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:08.729 
that'll start to go straight so just
keep<00:02:06.579> focused<00:02:07.000> on<00:02:07.119> that<00:02:07.270> point<00:02:07.509> one<00:02:08.349> meter<00:02:08.590> in

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
keep focused on that point one meter in

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.220 
keep focused on that point one meter in
front<00:02:09.069> and<00:02:09.640> when<00:02:09.849> you<00:02:09.940> get<00:02:10.090> wobbly<00:02:10.330> maybe<00:02:10.989> just

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
front and when you get wobbly maybe just

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.680 
front and when you get wobbly maybe just
push<00:02:11.410> a<00:02:11.440> little<00:02:11.530> bit<00:02:11.769> harder<00:02:11.830> on<00:02:12.099> the<00:02:12.280> pedals

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
push a little bit harder on the pedals

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.780 
push a little bit harder on the pedals
if<00:02:13.690> you<00:02:13.870> have<00:02:13.989> 10<00:02:14.260> years<00:02:14.530> on<00:02:14.799> the<00:02:14.830> on<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.430> rear

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
if you have 10 years on the on the rear

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.300 
if you have 10 years on the on the rear
cassette<00:02:16.379> first<00:02:17.379> of<00:02:17.530> all<00:02:17.620> I<00:02:17.709> just<00:02:17.739> do<00:02:18.099> one

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
cassette first of all I just do one

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.039 
cassette first of all I just do one
minute<00:02:18.489> in<00:02:18.760> each<00:02:18.910> gear<00:02:19.209> so<00:02:19.540> gets<00:02:19.690> harder<00:02:19.959> and

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
minute in each gear so gets harder and

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:21.330 
minute in each gear so gets harder and
harder<00:02:20.110> and<00:02:20.410> harder<00:02:20.500> so<00:02:20.799> that's<00:02:20.980> 10<00:02:21.160> minutes

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
harder and harder so that's 10 minutes

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.640 
harder and harder so that's 10 minutes
so<00:02:22.180> you<00:02:22.239> pick<00:02:22.540> a<00:02:22.629> certain<00:02:22.810> cadence<00:02:23.170> then<00:02:23.560> you

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
so you pick a certain cadence then you

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.170 
so you pick a certain cadence then you
just<00:02:23.830> say<00:02:23.950> that<00:02:24.129> same<00:02:24.340> cadence<00:02:24.579> which<00:02:24.940> means

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
just say that same cadence which means

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.729 
just say that same cadence which means
when<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.450> gear<00:02:25.630> gets<00:02:25.810> harder<00:02:26.110> every<00:02:26.319> time<00:02:26.349> it

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
when the gear gets harder every time it

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.309 
when the gear gets harder every time it
gets<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:27.730> load<00:02:27.910> gets<00:02:28.090> more<00:02:28.390> so<00:02:28.810> to<00:02:28.870> keep<00:02:29.200> the

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
gets the load gets more so to keep the

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.350 
gets the load gets more so to keep the
same<00:02:29.500> cadence<00:02:29.890> I<00:02:30.069> think<00:02:30.910> for<00:02:31.060> a<00:02:31.090> beginner

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
same cadence I think for a beginner

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.120 
same cadence I think for a beginner
thirty<00:02:31.630> minutes<00:02:31.930> is<00:02:32.079> too<00:02:32.260> much<00:02:32.410> because<00:02:32.920> then

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
thirty minutes is too much because then

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.910 
thirty minutes is too much because then
like<00:02:33.340> two<00:02:34.000> 2-minute<00:02:34.510> efforts<00:02:34.870> would<00:02:35.860> be

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
like two 2-minute efforts would be

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.370 
like two 2-minute efforts would be
really<00:02:36.340> enough<00:02:37.269> with<00:02:37.780> like<00:02:37.989> three<00:02:38.230> or<00:02:38.319> four

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
really enough with like three or four

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.559 
really enough with like three or four
minutes<00:02:38.560> recovery<00:02:39.130> and<00:02:39.730> that<00:02:40.269> would<00:02:40.360> be<00:02:40.450> the

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
minutes recovery and that would be the

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:41.789 
minutes recovery and that would be the
whole<00:02:40.720> session<00:02:40.930> then<00:02:41.230> it<00:02:41.319> just<00:02:41.440> a<00:02:41.530> bit<00:02:41.650> of<00:02:41.709> a

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
whole session then it just a bit of a

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.280 
whole session then it just a bit of a
warm<00:02:42.010> down<00:02:42.190> for<00:02:42.880> like<00:02:43.000> five<00:02:43.209> minutes<00:02:43.540> to<00:02:44.170> get

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
warm down for like five minutes to get

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.660 
warm down for like five minutes to get
off<00:02:44.410> the<00:02:44.530> rollers<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:45.040> best<00:02:45.250> thing<00:02:45.430> is<00:02:45.549> to

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
off the rollers the best thing is to

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.910 
off the rollers the best thing is to
hold<00:02:45.849> on<00:02:45.970> to<00:02:46.090> something<00:02:46.329> next<00:02:46.599> year<00:02:46.920> whether

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
hold on to something next year whether

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.550 
hold on to something next year whether
you're<00:02:48.069> paddling<00:02:48.250> down<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:49.840> hold<00:02:50.110> onto<00:02:50.290> the

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
you're paddling down and hold onto the

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.750 
you're paddling down and hold onto the
rear<00:02:50.709> brake<00:02:50.950> because<00:02:51.129> that's<00:02:51.459> going<00:02:51.549> to<00:02:51.640> give

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
rear brake because that's going to give

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
rear brake because that's going to give
you<00:02:51.849> a<00:02:51.879> bike<00:02:52.060> a<00:02:52.090> little<00:02:52.450> bit<00:02:52.540> of<00:02:52.629> stability

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
you a bike a little bit of stability

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.229 
you a bike a little bit of stability
when<00:02:53.260> you<00:02:53.349> lean<00:02:53.530> to<00:02:53.709> get<00:02:53.860> off<00:02:54.040> unclip<00:02:54.879> both<00:02:55.060> of

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
when you lean to get off unclip both of

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.300
