00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
year and what happened the line failed

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.359 
year and what happened the line failed
and<00:01:26.600> all<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.780> oil<00:01:27.810> dumped<00:01:28.530> out<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.950> engine

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
and all the oil dumped out of the engine

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.780
