00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:07.440
 hello to all guys and welcome to 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.880
 mumbai fan page properties are give 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.700
 caliendo is as you can see today 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.559
 let's talk about the mini job on job jam box 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.630
 company that has practically opened the 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.449
 portable speaker market 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.550
 bluetooth and then to then presented 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.829
 this new device that goes to 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.380
 join the jem box family 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:27.359
 composed of the normal and the big 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.619
 both have obviously been reviewed 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.970
 from us 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.329
 having said that the mini jam box is a 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.629
 very very interesting device yes 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.719
 square, however, in a middle range between 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:42.839
 three jam box devices because the big 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.489
 we know that it has a price of 299.99 euros 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:46.289
 then 300 euros 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.410
 the normal jumbo can now be found at 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.160
 150 euros in all major centers of 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.249
 distribution 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.909
 the mini at a price of 179 was 99 

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:59.460
 therefore practically 180 euros which 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:01.019
 in short, it places it in competition with 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.170
 now a lot of devices a lot 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.489
 similar that could also give him some 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.579
 hard to do but having said that we see 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.380
 quickly what comes out of the package 

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:11.159
 first of all the niger box but this one 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.500
 we'll talk about it later 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.049
 moreover, the cable comes out of the convection 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.270
 micro usb which is used for charging 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.320
 battery battery that is not 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.649
 different from those we already have 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.030
 known with the normal jem box that 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:25.740
 should ensure an autonomy of 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.570
 about 10 hours of use 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.649
 also just as we are used to 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.490
 the other djembe flashes 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:34.289
 the cable to connect and the speaker with 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.909
 what does the headphone jack mean? 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:36.869
 say that if you have a device you don't 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.369
 it's bluetooth or you want 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.189
 simply save on battery power 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.869
 you can use this cable to have 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.060
 a wired connection anyway 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.680
 listen to music that 's all 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.270
 contents of the package that already has a 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.100
 gene box will have realized that from 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.899
 packaging of the mini does not come out of the case 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.579
 protective thing that made me turn away 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.700
 the nose for two reasons the first is the 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.969
 price will have 180 euros a case is like 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.990
 second essential minimum is that 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.719
 however it is a device 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.700
 very small so it does tend 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.630
 the user who is bringing it in 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.580
 round 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.259
 and a protective case would have been 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.430
 however a very comfortable thing to 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.319
 protect 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.590
 having said that let's put it to the test 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.360
 we will do with a htc one max and here we are 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.540
 obviously now we will do a test with 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.739
 the htc one max but being bluetooth 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.450
 the mini jam box is compatible 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.739
 with virtually all devices e 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.110
 with all operating systems that 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.519
 therefore uses the a2dp standard too 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.680
 with computers if we are to be honest 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.720
 then obviously being wired you can 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.250
 connect practically to everything vi 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.690
 advance telling you the materials of 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.790
 construction of the mini jumbo I am 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.260
 really really fantastic I have to say 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.360
 it is precisely the truth to dear friends 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.989
 viewers each color has a 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.000
 fantasy and when it is in your hand and when 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.500
 is used for the mini jam box yes 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.810
 he realizes that you are talking anyway 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.819
 of a device of a certain level 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.290
 far from some cinesate 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.390
 pass me the term we find in 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.599
 lap weight was reduced compared to 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:03.000
 normal jam box the mini jam box weighs 100 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:06.329
 about grams less thinks 255 grams 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.130
 against the 347 of the normal one 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:09.150
 let's try a use of 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.010
 I show how it works obviously 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.810
 guys for the quality of the audio I 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.970
 I will try they would hear but on video 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.430
 obviously I will never make you understand 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.140
 how you feel I will describe you a little 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.220
 I also play and I will show you another 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.209
 small detail 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.739
 before proceeding with the test 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.150
 audio to let you see the mini jam 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.100
 box comparing it to the older brother 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.420
 own or with regard to 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.100
 size as you can see what 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.500
 change between two devices is 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.090
 practically only the width that passes 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:37.049
 from the four centimeters of the gene box 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.579
 large in quotation marks of the game box 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.350
 so this little thing means 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.329
 it means that in fact it is really a lot 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.090
 less bulky and less heavy 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.530
 as regards the height I 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.370
 devices are practically the same 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:52.230
 and slightly as you can see more 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:55.170
 long but really very little the mini 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.359
 but it's not something that influences 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.150
 on portability another detail 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:01.859
 of all the jam boxes not only of the mini is 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.810
 application application available 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:05.849
 obviously both for aires and for that 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.739
 android on android of specifically vi 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:09.840
 lets you do different things like 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.000
 I could say here at the top is an icon 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.750
 the second is the one you see 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.769
 practically thanks to those second yes 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.069
 can see the level of the 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.019
 battery of 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:20.979
 device natively possible 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:22.330
 with ios but for android it can be activated 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:23.710
 only through the application via 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.300
 these applications can be made 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.150
 Different things can be activated differently 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.860
 high functions for example is a 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.199
 function that practically changes 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.120
 equalization and of the two channels for 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:35.590
 giving a more enveloping hatred is possible for 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.690
 the first time activate only via the 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.849
 computer but actually once 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.199
 installed the application in the gene box 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:43.930
 because the applications come 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:47.050
 installed via a web app you can 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.759
 also modify this also through 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.500
 the web app can be installed 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:52.750
 voices because the jem box succeeds in 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.060
 communicate with the user through the 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.039
 entries for recorded obviously but this 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.930
 it's a function we're used to 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:00.490
 already for some time also through 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.099
 the application can modify us 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.050
 links that are assigned to 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:06.520
 jem box buttons thanks to which one 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.050
 may not only command reproduction 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.849
 of the song but you can activate the 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.440
 voice search or in any case the 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:12.099
 voice dialing of a contact e 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.479
 etc 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:15.490
 also just as I told you before 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.840
 promises the message and possible voice 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.060
 then choose the type of item 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.870
 with which the jem box will communicate with 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.030
 the user 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.430
 obviously to install them just like 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.810
 I said before need the connection of the 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.000
 computer jem box 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.220
 now proceed with the audio test 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.199
 we will do it using spotify we send 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:36.060
 a song that still has bass 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:36.060
 important enough to test it 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.440
 I 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:51.210
 take 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.260
 and I want to 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.440
 then 

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:08.749
 no 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:18.740
 here is how you could feel I hope 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:21.169
 the sound on my jam box is definitely it 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.539
 clean at maximum volume does not distort 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:26.300
 however, the group is not at all 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:27.740
 really very high but the right I have to 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.449
 to tell the truth there are the speakers of 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.879
 these dimensions that they wanted a lot 

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:35.360
 higher but still distracting the sound 

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:37.879
 appreciably the bass is average 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.490
 they are not incredible but guys one thing 

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:42.680
 it is certain the dimensions do not go 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.139
 agree with the power of the audio must 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.039
 be all very balanced 

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:48.949
 the equalization of the solo in my opinion 

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:51.469
 point a little too much on the mids but it is 

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:54.650
 however of a good balance that 

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:55.729
 could have improved in certain 

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:58.400
 wait 

00:06:55.729 --> 00:07:00.199
 is true that for 180 euros anyway 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.580
 there are many alternatives 

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:03.740
 so I honestly don't recommend 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.629
 buy the mini jack eye box 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:08.270
 closed however we start from the assumption 

00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:10.340
 what jobs is a leading company in the sector 

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:12.560
 the support is fantastic e 

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:14.449
 the application is however a march in 

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.129
 more than it is given to the speaker who is 

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:18.020
 however very very versatile with the 

00:07:16.129 --> 00:07:18.979
 which you can also talk to 

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.900
 phone 

00:07:18.979 --> 00:07:23.479
 I am of the king caliendo I hope to have you 

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:25.490
 given help in deciding whether to buy 

00:07:23.479 --> 00:07:28.490
 or not this device I invite you to 

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:29.990
 read the written review why 

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:32.330
 in the written review I will post 

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.889
 however the technical specifications and others 

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:37.360
 little details 

00:07:33.889 --> 00:07:37.360
 a hug and see you soon
