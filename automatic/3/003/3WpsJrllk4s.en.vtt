to make sure that the numbers were right
in<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.170> middle<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.650> decided<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.700> measure<00:01:09.240> out

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
in the middle I decided to measure out

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.230 
in the middle I decided to measure out
with<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.780> measuring<00:01:10.290> tape<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:11.190> width<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.909> the

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
with a measuring tape the width of the

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.480 
with a measuring tape the width of the
top<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.780> shirt<00:01:12.990> seam<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.590> then<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.250> just

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
top of the shirt seam and then I just

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.490 
top of the shirt seam and then I just
put<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.790> in<00:01:14.940> half<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.479> then<00:01:15.540> then<00:01:16.140> just<00:01:16.170> iron

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
put it in half and then then just iron

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.320 
put it in half and then then just iron
the<00:01:16.710> shirt<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.920> little<00:01:17.100> bit<00:01:17.340> before<00:01:17.759> we<00:01:17.790> started

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
the shirt a little bit before we started

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.120 
the shirt a little bit before we started
so<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.840> would<00:01:18.960> be<00:01:19.050> extra<00:01:19.409> smooth<00:01:19.649> then<00:01:20.040> I

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
so that it would be extra smooth then I

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.190 
so that it would be extra smooth then I
peeled<00:01:20.399> the<00:01:20.550> numbers<00:01:20.909> off<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.720> pieces<00:01:21.990> of

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.020 
peeled the numbers off of the pieces of
paper<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:22.979> laid<00:01:23.190> them<00:01:23.369> down<00:01:23.399> on<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.759> shirt

adhesive<00:01:24.930> side<00:01:25.140> down<00:01:25.250> which<00:01:26.250> would<00:01:26.460> be<00:01:26.640> the

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:26.789 
adhesive side down which would be the

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:28.730
