00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:18.280
 Hybrid system and of the turbo engine 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:20.110
 That if there is an engine in the base but Well I like a a place in common 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:24.670
 Improve performance 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:26.039
 Air and say regarding the hybrid system referred to in the turbo engine to boost electricity 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.390
 Boost Then 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.349
 ohhhhhhhh 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:35.470
 It's just a different as it were Well Tteyuu Toka air boost or electric booth 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.440
 I think that I say by thinking like that 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:42.920
 Our goal is 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:47.890
 It was a very simple thing to do with driving and the year 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:50.890
 But just like that, it's like the past turbo engine 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:56.470
 Rush without'm turbo Ri Sport and bait 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:59.470
 But if Toka smooth the acceleration g is going to stand up such a Ano 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:04.180
 Emphasis on feeling very much 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:07.210
 Once Emo cane that of the testimony in the fact that the turbo seems to acceleration feeling 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:12.430
 Beneath it believes that trying to achieve such a thing 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:15.820
 That development was very stoic because it was a high goal . 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:21.159
 For example, the request for the response 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:25.750
 It is that exchange of the engine when trying to realize what is called ideal acceleration g 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:27.200
 I have to build up well from the young as a partner, but in fact 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.140
 Its lower class 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:35.790
 The combustion system is about 2005 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:41.880
 After starting the research, it is overwintering continuously. 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:44.900
 I've continued my research, so the back story is that I'm connected to this kind of development 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.900
 And to you there is 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:54.510
 Something like that smoothly extends will accelerate 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:02:00.390
 I'm talking about it, but this is a bit more specific like accelerating g curves 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:05.600
 Hey and charge it and draw it on a graph and draw such a curve 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:11.390
 To get up smoothly and beautifully realizes what is called an acceleration next curve 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:13.400
 As a measure for fuel consumption, as with hybrids, there is a stack of 0% what 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:18.590
 Until the last moment to step on the accelerator 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:22.340
 We also developed a stop &amp; start system that does not allow idling 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:26.190
 Though the hybrid system is a turbo system though neither is 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:29.670
 And the very high performance that was created 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:34.740
 I think that there is no meaning if it can be demonstrated in the world 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:40.440
 Mileage is over more than one million kilograms in such of our that of course that car 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:45.240
 Come not Re the brew and x before Well and had become a very long used to go so 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:47.960
 Contact the Fu that also kana are each from homogeneous confidence that things are such a running test 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.960
 Am thinking 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.720
 Hybrid development always goes against fuel consumption 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:01.440
 It was a battle of redo with noise and vibration 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:06.380
 I have always wasted time related to the Redo 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.380
 Directly below I have thought much want devoted to the performance development 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:19.640
 I am going to tackle mind and body to this problem when the time was in charge of nx hybrid system of 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:21.840
 Those who make noise or vibration have the keyword of chronology, and so pervade everyone 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.810
 I have been active 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:31.050
 It was a very difficult activity 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:36.510
 Knowing the numerous noises and reductions and mechanisms across the pro king, make an early prediction of it and 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:37.260
 It is an activity that such a difficult activity nobody has put up hand when we take measures early 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.260
 But 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:44.830
 As a result, 70 pages of development sites 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:48.100
 The leaves of this nx feelings that I put each on it can be finished until the people 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:55.890
 I Tsugikomi all hybrid 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:04:01.410
 I was able to concentrate on the power performance and fuel efficiency of the wing that was created as a result of putting in mind 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:04.560
 It is natural to realize top class fuel efficiency, but it is not only that 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:08.840
 Take a prototype overseas at the stage 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:13.069
 And we actually ran and worked on making effort performance 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:17.889
 For example, we confirm our hospital performance with chopsticks of Europe 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:21.340
 I have been running at American coach baseball slope 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:28.629
 The nx hybrid thus created is power 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:30.020
 It can be said that it is a car that actually embodies a standing star in Lexus's of fuel consumption and noise vibration. 

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:36.110
 I think 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:38.590
 So you have to experience the stand Soboshi to the I am behind the wheel all means at everyone 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.590
 I would like
