00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.190 
show you a simple in this video a simple
design<00:00:07.470> for<00:00:08.160> making<00:00:08.610> castle<00:00:09.090> now<00:00:09.929> you<00:00:09.990> can

design for making castle now you can

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.780 
design for making castle now you can
make<00:00:10.260> it<00:00:10.410> a<00:00:10.500> lot<00:00:10.740> bigger<00:00:11.010> than<00:00:11.130> this<00:00:11.280> I'm<00:00:11.519> just

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.419 
make it a lot bigger than this I'm just
showing<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.480> little<00:00:12.630> example<00:00:13.110> Castle<00:00:13.799> how<00:00:14.160> it's

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
showing a little example Castle how it's

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:15.860 
showing a little example Castle how it's
going<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.639> look<00:00:14.700> so<00:00:15.330> you're<00:00:15.450> going<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.660> do<00:00:15.750> is

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
going to look so you're going to do is

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.990 
going to look so you're going to do is
going<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:16.049> make<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.230> little<00:00:16.800> zigzag<00:00:17.369> shape<00:00:17.730> like

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
going to make a little zigzag shape like

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.060 
going to make a little zigzag shape like
a<00:00:18.029> zipper<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.900> when<00:00:19.289> you<00:00:19.380> get<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.680> edge<00:00:19.800> to

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
a zipper and when you get to the edge to

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.250 
a zipper and when you get to the edge to
make<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.220> curve<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:20.699> go<00:00:20.880> three<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:21.930> then<00:00:22.230> you

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
make a curve you go three and then you

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.740 
make a curve you go three and then you
go<00:00:22.500> back<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.070> same<00:00:23.279> pattern<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:23.939> then<00:00:24.689> you

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
go back to the same pattern and then you

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.099 
go back to the same pattern and then you
do<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:25.019> on<00:00:25.109> every<00:00:25.350> side<00:00:25.609> and<00:00:26.869> you<00:00:27.869> can<00:00:28.019> make

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
do that on every side and you can make

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.349 
do that on every side and you can make
it<00:00:28.230> as<00:00:28.349> tall<00:00:28.560> as<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:28.859> want<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.640> don't<00:00:29.880> like<00:00:30.240> I

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
it as tall as you want you don't like I

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.580 
it as tall as you want you don't like I
said<00:00:30.570> before<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:31.019> don't<00:00:31.109> have<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.349> make<00:00:31.470> it

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
said before you don't have to make it

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.590 
said before you don't have to make it
the<00:00:31.859> same<00:00:32.189> size<00:00:32.460> as<00:00:32.669> this<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:33.059> can<00:00:33.180> make<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.360> as

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
the same size as this you can make it as

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.979 
the same size as this you can make it as
much<00:00:33.840> this<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.380> just<00:00:34.649> example<00:00:35.370> on<00:00:35.809> what<00:00:36.809> it's

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
much this is just example on what it's

much this is just example on what it's
mostly<00:00:37.440> going<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.739> look<00:00:37.890> like<00:00:38.149> the<00:00:39.149> design<00:00:40.610> so

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
mostly going to look like the design so

standard<00:00:56.309> size<00:00:56.520> for<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.879> castle<00:00:59.059> yeah<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.300> like

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
standard size for a castle yeah so like

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.170 
standard size for a castle yeah so like
the<00:01:01.170> i<00:01:01.530> would<00:01:01.980> say<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.280> most<00:01:02.430> difficult<00:01:02.910> part

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
the i would say the most difficult part

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.700 
the i would say the most difficult part
is<00:01:03.359> getting<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.780> top<00:01:04.049> if<00:01:04.290> you're<00:01:04.439> planning

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
is getting the top if you're planning

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.429 
is getting the top if you're planning
this<00:01:04.830> in<00:01:04.979> survival<00:01:05.580> because<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.930> do<00:01:07.080> tend<00:01:07.380> to

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
this in survival because you do tend to

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.219 
this in survival because you do tend to
fall<00:01:07.740> off<00:01:07.979> most<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.670> time<00:01:08.939> but<00:01:09.780> since<00:01:10.110> we

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
fall off most of the time but since we

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.870 
fall off most of the time but since we
have<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.590> good<00:01:10.770> old<00:01:10.920> creative<00:01:11.460> mode<00:01:11.700> in

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
have the good old creative mode in

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.590 
have the good old creative mode in
Minecraft<00:01:12.780> then<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.740> as<00:01:13.890> easy<00:01:14.070> as

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
Minecraft then this is as easy as

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.429 
Minecraft then this is as easy as
spreading<00:01:16.009> butter<00:01:17.009> on<00:01:17.250> your<00:01:17.280> bagel<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.439> anyway

alright so when you're done you're going
to<00:01:56.300> fill<00:01:56.510> in<00:01:56.690> those<00:01:56.840> zippers<00:01:57.260> and<00:01:57.530> not<00:01:58.190> the

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
to fill in those zippers and not the

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.770 
to fill in those zippers and not the
head<00:01:58.520> you're<00:01:58.730> going<00:01:58.850> to<00:01:58.970> make<00:01:59.120> it<00:01:59.270> go<00:01:59.360> to<00:01:59.420> out

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
head you're going to make it go to out

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.130 
head you're going to make it go to out
on<00:01:59.990> both<00:02:00.290> sides<00:02:00.590> so<00:02:01.550> state<00:02:02.510> keeps<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:02.930> same

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
on both sides so state keeps the same

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.500 
on both sides so state keeps the same
pattern<00:02:03.590> that<00:02:04.070> you<00:02:04.340> were<00:02:04.640> originally<00:02:05.150> using

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
pattern that you were originally using

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.170 
pattern that you were originally using
on<00:02:05.750> the<00:02:06.260> zipper<00:02:06.590> pattern<00:02:06.920> so<00:02:07.850> yeah<00:02:08.000> you're

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:08.180 
on the zipper pattern so yeah you're

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.100 
on the zipper pattern so yeah you're
going<00:02:08.330> to<00:02:08.390> make<00:02:08.479> it<00:02:08.600> go<00:02:08.690> to<00:02:08.750> out<00:02:09.200> and<00:02:10.750> just<00:02:11.750> just

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
going to make it go to out and just just
