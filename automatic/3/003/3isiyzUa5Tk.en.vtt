I picked up this one is it's pretty
cheap<00:06:02.120> it's<00:06:03.120> not<00:06:03.360> in<00:06:03.450> that<00:06:03.540> sense<00:06:03.840> and<00:06:04.520> it's

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
cheap it's not in that sense and it's

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.490 
cheap it's not in that sense and it's
got<00:06:05.700> all<00:06:05.850> those<00:06:06.260> settings<00:06:07.260> where<00:06:08.190> you<00:06:08.220> can

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.500 
got all those settings where you can

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.800 
got all those settings where you can
basically<00:06:10.610> rotate<00:06:11.610> all<00:06:11.820> the<00:06:11.970> video<00:06:12.210> clips<00:06:12.390> so

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810 
basically rotate all the video clips so

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:17.390 
basically rotate all the video clips so
you<00:06:13.080> can<00:06:13.520> in<00:06:14.520> my<00:06:14.730> case<00:06:15.030> set<00:06:15.600> up<00:06:15.720> I<00:06:16.620> recall<00:06:17.250> I

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 
you can in my case set up I recall I

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:22.970 
you can in my case set up I recall I
keep<00:06:18.950> ten<00:06:20.090> ten<00:06:21.170> segments<00:06:22.170> and<00:06:22.440> each<00:06:22.710> segment

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:22.980 
keep ten ten segments and each segment

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.060 
keep ten ten segments and each segment
is<00:06:23.910> six<00:06:24.270> minutes<00:06:24.630> so<00:06:24.930> altogether<00:06:25.530> I<00:06:25.770> have<00:06:26.040> a

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:26.070 
is six minutes so altogether I have a

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:30.530 
is six minutes so altogether I have a
stack<00:06:26.400> of<00:06:26.600> hour<00:06:27.600> worth<00:06:27.930> of<00:06:28.170> video<00:06:29.240> and<00:06:30.240> then

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:30.540 
stack of hour worth of video and then

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.830 
stack of hour worth of video and then
you<00:06:30.780> can<00:06:30.810> set<00:06:31.140> up<00:06:31.290> the<00:06:31.500> different<00:06:32.490> speed<00:06:32.840> miles

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 
you can set up the different speed miles

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.210 
you can set up the different speed miles
per<00:06:34.050> hour<00:06:34.700> km/h<00:06:36.560> you<00:06:37.560> can<00:06:37.740> blank<00:06:38.040> the<00:06:38.190> screen

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.220 
per hour km/h you can blank the screen

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.300 
per hour km/h you can blank the screen
when<00:06:39.120> your<00:06:39.240> speed<00:06:39.540> is<00:06:39.660> over<00:06:40.130> 50,000<00:06:41.130> an<00:06:41.190> hour

when your speed is over 50,000 an hour

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.390 
when your speed is over 50,000 an hour
this<00:06:41.580> is<00:06:41.730> a<00:06:41.840> course<00:06:42.840> a<00:06:42.990> testable<00:06:43.470> and<00:06:44.040> you<00:06:44.250> can

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 
this is a course a testable and you can

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.400 
this is a course a testable and you can
turn<00:06:44.550> on<00:06:44.610> the<00:06:44.760> auto<00:06:45.330> crash<00:06:45.900> detection

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:46.410 
turn on the auto crash detection

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:49.600 
turn on the auto crash detection
basically<00:06:47.370> it's<00:06:47.760> using<00:06:48.660> the<00:06:48.750> g-force<00:06:49.140> sensor

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:49.610 
basically it's using the g-force sensor

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.600 
basically it's using the g-force sensor
built<00:06:50.610> to<00:06:50.850> your<00:06:50.880> phone<00:06:51.300> to<00:06:51.740> detect<00:06:52.740> whether

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:53.610 
built to your phone to detect whether

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:56.510 
built to your phone to detect whether
you<00:06:53.850> are<00:06:53.910> in<00:06:54.060> an<00:06:54.450> accident<00:06:54.950> I<00:06:55.950> hope<00:06:56.250> you<00:06:56.400> know

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:56.520 
you are in an accident I hope you know

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.890 
you are in an accident I hope you know
whenever<00:06:56.790> in<00:06:57.060> the<00:06:57.150> situation<00:06:57.600> that<00:06:57.630> you<00:06:57.870> need

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:57.900 
whenever in the situation that you need

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.310 
whenever in the situation that you need
to<00:06:58.140> use<00:06:58.320> this<00:06:58.580> in<00:06:59.580> my<00:06:59.730> case<00:07:00.000> I<00:07:00.180> just<00:07:00.390> basically

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:01.320 
to use this in my case I just basically

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.260 
to use this in my case I just basically
shut<00:07:01.770> it<00:07:01.860> off

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:04.270 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.719 

so<00:07:04.750> then<00:07:05.349> you<00:07:05.470> just<00:07:05.680> push<00:07:05.949> this<00:07:06.130> button<00:07:06.310> and<00:07:06.669> it

00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:06.729
