teachers<00:02:11.510> are<00:02:11.720> traditionally<00:02:12.290> held<00:02:12.440> to<00:02:12.890> a

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
teachers are traditionally held to a

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.619 
teachers are traditionally held to a
high<00:02:13.190> moral<00:02:13.580> standard<00:02:14.030> in<00:02:14.150> a<00:02:14.239> community

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:14.629 
high moral standard in a community

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:16.420 
high moral standard in a community
exactly<00:02:15.170> it's<00:02:15.290> a<00:02:15.349> morals<00:02:15.680> clause<00:02:15.769> basically

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
exactly it's a morals clause basically

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.290 
exactly it's a morals clause basically
which<00:02:16.550> a<00:02:16.640> lot<00:02:16.790> of<00:02:16.819> people<00:02:16.910> have<00:02:17.180> in<00:02:17.269> their

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.400 
which a lot of people have in their
contracts<00:02:17.810> that<00:02:17.900> they<00:02:17.989> do<00:02:18.049> have<00:02:18.200> a<00:02:18.290> contract

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
contracts that they do have a contract

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.620 
contracts that they do have a contract
so<00:02:19.590> it<00:02:19.890> just<00:02:20.010> means<00:02:20.430> that<00:02:20.580> she<00:02:20.880> has<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.300> be<00:02:21.420> held

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
had done it okay and since it's really

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.680 
had done it okay and since it's really
nothing<00:03:04.980> its<00:03:05.280> job<00:03:05.550> related<00:03:05.700> in<00:03:06.180> a<00:03:06.240> sense<00:03:06.510> of

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
nothing its job related in a sense of

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.530 
nothing its job related in a sense of
her<00:03:07.220> wearing<00:03:08.220> a<00:03:08.310> bikini<00:03:08.460> she<00:03:08.820> wasn't<00:03:09.180> knew<00:03:09.300> she

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
her wearing a bikini she wasn't knew she

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.750 
her wearing a bikini she wasn't knew she

wasn't at a strip club she wasn't pole
dancing<00:03:12.300> it's<00:03:12.480> something<00:03:12.840> that<00:03:13.170> when<00:03:13.860> she

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
dancing it's something that when she

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.020 
dancing it's something that when she
there<00:03:14.400> every<00:03:14.760> day<00:03:14.820> like<00:03:16.640> what<00:03:17.640> you're<00:03:17.790> saying

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
I think you're making my point which is

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.900 
I think you're making my point which is
at<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.590> very<00:03:19.860> least<00:03:20.130> of<00:03:20.340> not<00:03:20.460> seeking<00:03:20.820> a

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
at the very least of not seeking a

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.280 
at the very least of not seeking a
lawyer<00:03:21.120> like<00:03:21.360> you<00:03:21.420> she<00:03:21.810> should<00:03:21.990> have<00:03:22.080> gone<00:03:22.230> to

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
lawyer like you she should have gone to

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.780 
lawyer like you she should have gone to
the<00:03:22.530> school<00:03:22.800> and<00:03:22.830> said<00:03:23.160> to<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:23.370> school<00:03:23.610> is

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
the school and said to the school is

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.520 
the school and said to the school is
this<00:03:24.150> okay<00:03:24.480> when<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:24.720> morality<00:03:25.170> clause<00:03:25.350> is

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
this okay when the morality clause is

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.140 
this okay when the morality clause is
this<00:03:25.650> okay<00:03:25.950> with<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.430> code<00:03:26.580> of<00:03:26.730> ethics<00:03:27.000> and

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
this okay with the code of ethics and

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.370 
this okay with the code of ethics and
they<00:03:27.300> probably<00:03:27.450> would<00:03:27.690> have<00:03:27.750> said<00:03:27.959> no<00:03:27.990> but<00:03:28.140> she

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
they probably would have said no but she

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.480 
they probably would have said no but she
should<00:03:28.500> have<00:03:28.620> at<00:03:28.680> least<00:03:28.709> gone<00:03:29.040> to<00:03:29.190> them<00:03:29.340> and

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
should have at least gone to them and

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.880 
should have at least gone to them and
ask<00:03:29.670> them<00:03:29.820> shouldn't<00:03:30.390> you<00:03:30.450> if<00:03:31.140> he/she<00:03:31.350> wanted

successful defending her well first of
all<00:03:36.750> it<00:03:36.930> would<00:03:37.020> depend<00:03:37.170> upon<00:03:37.740> several<00:03:38.130> factors

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
all it would depend upon several factors

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.460

we<00:04:27.500> see<00:04:27.680> that<00:04:27.710> distinction<00:04:28.250> specifically

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
we see that distinction specifically

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.420 
we see that distinction specifically
because<00:04:29.180> mores<00:04:30.050> and<00:04:30.080> culture<00:04:30.740> change<00:04:31.040> over

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
I'm happy to be an actual point again is

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.820 
I'm happy to be an actual point again is
that<00:04:49.640> you<00:04:49.820> know<00:04:49.940> by<00:04:50.330> actually<00:04:50.930> firing<00:04:51.260> her<00:04:51.620> and

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
that you know by actually firing her and

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.920 
that you know by actually firing her and
placing<00:04:52.430> it<00:04:52.520> in<00:04:52.700> front<00:04:53.120> page<00:04:53.420> on<00:04:53.690> this

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
placing it in front page on this

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.510 
placing it in front page on this
particular<00:04:54.290> program<00:04:54.650> and<00:04:55.100> all<00:04:55.190> over<00:04:55.340> the

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
particular program and all over the

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.310 
particular program and all over the
country<00:04:55.880> now<00:04:56.000> I<00:04:56.030> think<00:04:56.270> that<00:04:56.630> the<00:04:57.020> school

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
country now I think that the school

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.840 
country now I think that the school
district<00:04:57.800> 11<00:04:58.070> would<00:04:58.310> it<00:04:58.430> really<00:04:58.520> have<00:04:58.700> to<00:04:58.760> look

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
district 11 would it really have to look

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.420 
district 11 would it really have to look
at<00:04:59.120> their<00:04:59.270> motives<00:04:59.600> for<00:05:00.160> considering<00:05:01.160> that<00:05:01.310> is

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
at their motives for considering that is

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.850 
at their motives for considering that is
May<00:05:01.670> and<00:05:02.030> June<00:05:02.390> the<00:05:02.840> school<00:05:03.050> years<00:05:03.290> over<00:05:03.350> and

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
May and June the school years over and

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.260 
May and June the school years over and
they<00:05:04.190> could<00:05:04.340> have<00:05:04.430> certainly<00:05:04.730> dealt<00:05:04.970> with<00:05:05.150> it

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
they could have certainly dealt with it

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.510 
they could have certainly dealt with it
in<00:05:05.330> that<00:05:05.510> fashion<00:05:05.780> I<00:05:06.080> think<00:05:06.110> there<00:05:06.800> they<00:05:07.190> put<00:05:07.490> a

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
in that fashion I think there they put a

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.240 
in that fashion I think there they put a
spotlight<00:05:07.910> on<00:05:08.210> it<00:05:08.660> his<00:05:09.110> last<00:05:09.320> words<00:05:09.500> I<00:05:10.010> mean<00:05:10.160> I

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
spotlight on it his last words I mean I

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.740 
spotlight on it his last words I mean I
don't<00:05:10.280> see<00:05:10.730> how<00:05:10.820> you<00:05:10.910> can<00:05:11.000> tribute<00:05:11.300> any<00:05:11.510> kind

don't see how you can tribute any kind

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:12.940 
don't see how you can tribute any kind
