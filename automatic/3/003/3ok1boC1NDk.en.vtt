00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.120
 ah 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.810
 nothing is impossible 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.010
 since I was little I always liked 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:25.759
 playing football also never never what 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.200
 I have done training and I have not been any 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:31.460
 team but I 've always liked to play 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:33.410
 at school with colleagues I've started 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.210
 playing basketball as free time 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.579
 Well, sometimes it was a bit of football 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.800
 but good just play by playing 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.519
 everybody talks a lot about brazil and 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.010
 Spain I think that two of the clear 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:48.839
 favorites to be able to fight for him or for 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.870
 this global good brazil I think that 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:53.399
 more than anything for playing at home good 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.870
 bodies last year because it was to see 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.960
 maybe 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.370
 gaining a little confidence again from 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.500
 have won the Confederations Cup 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.850
 especially before being in the final 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.769
 what good in the team I think that a 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.280
 beat that everyone then sees as the 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.750
 stronger and better rival and Spain for its 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.380
 people I believe that what has been demonstrated 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.290
 the last years since the last 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.660
 eurocopas the last world cup 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.910
 I'm wearing it because the truth is that it has 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.500
 called a call and the artifice 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.820
 good for Spain that also 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.770
 I think he was neither has 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.420
 a career here in Spain has the 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.770
 opportunity to play in one of the 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.440
 best selections in the world that since 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.630
 Spain right now maybe because of him 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.630
 has this feeling that it has been 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.610
 betrayed or left aside in a 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.870
 important moment where he could have 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.060
 had his chance in the cup 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.710
 confederations for example and that then 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.659
 maybe they're good for this, it's worth every 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.810
 player not 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.929
 neymar as a player I think everything 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.819
 world is delighted the things that is 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:56.789
 able to do within a field of 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:59.009
 soccer export the player who has a 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:01.259
 incredible future a projection can 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.659
 be tremendous and I hope I can continue 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.549
 this level he does not want football the 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.489
 football and that's what has to be 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:11.069
 thinking not to let everything else then 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:12.959
 that people say b12 but that the one 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.640
 Always be focused on what is the 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.610
 surfing his thing that is playing and good that what 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.690
 makes divinely credible better with the 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.690
 basketball ball and with it
