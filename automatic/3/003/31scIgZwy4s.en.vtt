00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:28.460
 Slavic mythology yes somehow from the very 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:32.090
 subconscious began to float in me 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.670
 because I remember the childhood I drew 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.030
 a child's image of these images of the gods 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:41.960
 knights where they came from but why 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:45.340
 here is some naitiyu threw me 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:50.300
 here to portray such beautiful heroes 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:53.390
 beautiful ladies in royal robes and then 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:57.380
 already somehow started reading fairy tales already when 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:00.829
 so I went to school I learned to read 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:03.710
 avidly read books loved cause 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.500
 Russian Russian folklore in Russian 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.500
 tales pancakes all this probably is how 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.290
 it also helped to sharpen and from this 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.050
 moment to me 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.210
 Here I remember my school notebooks 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:20.380
 there all the time for expressing batteries 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:23.500
 knights goddesses so that's how something like this 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.830
 so it came by itself probably 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.560
 somewhere from the inside here it all goes even 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.770
 here is a school I did a diploma but I am a topic 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.790
 historical historical theme was 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:39.150
 Kulikov field 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.070
 where he too swam this image nude 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.650
 so somewhere in the 5 I quietly 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.500
 somehow subconsciously what is quite 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.690
 consciously but when i began to do cum 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.750
 I somehow threw it on these things later 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:55.509
 later of course I am purely conscious 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.759
 when faced with the fact that when 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.310
 such a rich history with such a baobab 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.710
 there in folklore 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:07.960
 unfortunately very little picture is written 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:10.750
 Russian artists grew up in the topic so I became 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.610
 already consciously allocate the main part 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.620
 your Russian creativity 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.989
 mythology of russian history russian 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:21.280
 the cultures of my childhood itself 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:23.340
 imprinted vasnetsov his work I remember 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.989
 with what pleasure are you being there 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.250
 when I was four years old I looked around 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.940
 these pictures of him 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.769
 of how all this is good then this 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.959
 it was possible to remember it all 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:39.370
 came to work at his father too 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:41.590
 worked in a club for such work with us 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.400
 right there on the walls, too, these 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:48.400
 paintings of russian peredvizhniki Russians in 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.769
 including Vasnetsov ryabushkina and surikova 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.319
 it was probably somehow postponed 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.390
 then 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:57.150
 it's all worked in the same school on 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:00.030
 the walls hung again a picture of a classic all 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:03.420
 it affected awareness on the subconscious in 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:07.879
 I end up somehow more and more 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:11.670
 imbibed this topic by ivan-tsarevich 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:15.480
 on the gray wolf plane-carpet will find out 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.590
 here it is the sleeping Indian princess all 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.230
 this here this 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.919
 say it in my mind left 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:26.000
 so much so though it was a long time ago 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:28.680
 she will return somehow also played a role 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.530
 Vasnetsov remain for me like that 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.449
 Iâ€™m not saying the most outstanding 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.449
 he may be the greatest but here he is 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:38.819
 influenced me very much so far i 

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:40.469
 somehow admiring bow when 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.239
 I come to Moscow, I try all the same 

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:44.699
 go to the house museum and worship it 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.379
 memory is good that there is such a motive 

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:48.269
 dreaming 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:53.389
 but recently I illustrated 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:56.159
 book in there warrior land tambovskaya 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:04:00.090
 pancake legends and traditions collected here 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:01.500
 Rogovskaya nude in Slavic purity and on 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.709
 the subject there is all this 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.109
 well not unique i'm working not in 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.030
 that she is very outstanding 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:13.259
 it was very interesting 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:16.139
 lift your legs near 18 and in depth 

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:18.769
 events going all this but it's like you 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:22.169
 not familiar close expensive therefore 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:24.409
 content big delivered i try a 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:27.110
 in general, stick to these 

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:31.050
 of the document 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:33.990
 facts and clothes of victoria in the style of life 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.930
 somehow you study this stuff here 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.460
 trying to get a hold on and by the way 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.340
 it better even helps to feel 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.380
 Here is purely Slavic culture because 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.690
 so that there was no confusion because 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.260
 often so I observe the pictures by 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:52.080
 works that are confused like she's old and 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:55.050
 old on one thing in the cold 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:05:00.030
 antique another thing east there germany 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:03.750
 there the Slavs wildly their style and 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:06.090
 life style clothing stillavin astilby the 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.930
 in general, that is why everything is known in 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.510
 comparing 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:12.690
 unfortunately we haven't heard much 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:15.780
 Slavic past as ethnography 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.580
 so the structure of everyones because in 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.010
 mostly tree prevailed or 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.200
 They Komi here in this regard, antiques more 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.960
 lucky it is still a stone and stayed with 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.440
 I am more than all of us if we consider that 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.440
 somehow 

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:35.589
 not formally accepted with acceptance 

00:05:30.739 --> 00:05:36.709
 Christianity in all this in general then 

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:39.349
 ruined 

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:44.139
 unfortunately you have to restore 

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:49.699
 all these ornaments here are all styles there 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:52.909
 architectural as also for those small 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:54.830
 the lobules that have come down to us 

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:58.069
 lucky I somehow drew my time 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:59.719
 focus on archeology sir coming out 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:02.569
 such a book and there it is pure 

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:05.499
 documented it's all very meticulous 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:09.439
 let not so much but the main thing actually 

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:11.659
 catch the meaning of the direction here it is 

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:14.029
 later on I do fantasies and 

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:16.729
 imagination and subconscious mind here somehow 

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:18.619
 we here I still speak in general well 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:20.329
 here it helps comparison 

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:22.879
 what i know what oriental mean it 

00:06:20.329 --> 00:06:24.910
 such was dreamed of here among the Slavs 

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:28.660
 may be present there 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:31.540
 in greece another eagle before the goal then all this 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:33.700
 tags are summarized here there is not a hundred 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:35.920
 percent i'm nobody doing this but 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:39.160
 less eager to somehow at least those 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:43.330
 more or less restore that image of Russia 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:46.360
 them which unfortunately almost 90 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:48.970
 percent with a tail lost wanted 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:51.940
 would make people see understand 

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:55.080
 imbued with beauty and that world in 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.080
 which the Slavs lived
