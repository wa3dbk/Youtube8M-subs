 apartment operation on the 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.439
 motocross track it is not 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.849
 everyday and above all one 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.790
 dangerous sport 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:34.460
 the drivers know that and protect their breasts 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:37.250
 legs arms back and spine with 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.730
 special protectors helmets gloves 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.230
 boots and protective clothing are 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.860
 Of course, nevertheless it comes 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.300
 again and again to severe injuries 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.890
 an accident happens here 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.330
 affected section of the race track 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.269
 secured immediately 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:56.059
 only then can the first responders of the 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:57.769
 kidney accident because it goes 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:07.490
 they and others of 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:10.340
 First Aid never patient 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:16.880
 has a life-threatening bleeding the 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:19.010
 must be stopped immediately 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.320
 direct pressure on the wound may be this 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.670
 being stopped 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.500
 This pressure is allowed to create a 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:30.079
 pressure bandage can not be solved 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:33.469
 to the 8000 accidents with motorcycles or 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:36.619
 mopeds are based per year in 2011 alone 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:38.899
 85 people came to Austria 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.329
 to live in accidents 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.189
 whether in traffic at work or in the 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:45.829
 Many people often spend their leisure time 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:48.649
 but only a few witnesses 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:49.700
 are able and thus already first 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.950
 to help 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.439
 but just the rapid hedge of the 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.229
 accident immediate emergency call 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:02:00.700
 and the right first aid measures 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.700
 save human life 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.119
 In such serious accidents it can be too 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.420
 life-threatening head injuries 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.420
 The cervical spine provides one 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.670
 extremely sensitive area because of the weight 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.620
 the weight of the helmet comes from the head 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.930
 In addition, the probability is 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:30.510
 an injury to the cervical spine 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:32.190
 very high as a basic principle applies to 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.739
 Checking and securing the respiratory tract 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.610
 he must crash in an unconscious 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:40.380
 Person always taken off 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.080
 by means of a wall compress one 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.519
 body and a triangle yet it can 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:52.920
 you quickly get a pressure bandage 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:55.680
 You can invest in the outgoing one 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.900
 first aid measures not 5 march 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.420
 to discourage the statements made by the person concerned 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.980
 the supply of the strong bleeding has 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.980
 absolute priority now 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.340
 immediately afterwards emergency call had to be dropped off 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.530
 become 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.310
 notruf rescue control center they want 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.310

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.110
 the emergency call expert for through the 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.400
 call and can be targeted first 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.400
 give help instructions 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:35.579
 It is important to ask all questions 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.519
 answer and the phone is not 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:41.220
 to end early 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.440
 I have exactly what is next to me 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.030
 do 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.390
 but during the emergency call query 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.920
 Already sent the rescue service 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.230
 average pass between 7 and 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.040
 15 minutes to the rescue service 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:58.310
 arrives 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.310
 a time to return it as a first responder 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.580
 an injured person is the guard 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.450
 should it be the situation found 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.810
 leave 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.030
 and be moved as little as possible 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.820
 It is also important to heat 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.620
 pay attention and mentally to the patient 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.660
 operate 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:21.950
 Let's summarize this point together 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:24.620
 fuzzy as a first responder should look out for 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:27.680
 call for your self protection and help

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:35.750
 leave life-threatening bleeding 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:38.420
 Take off the helmet and the respiratory tract 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:41.290
 free and the rescue service 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:43.250
 alert to protect against heat loss 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.980
 constantly monitor the 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:50.230
 Consciousness and breathing and 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:52.670
 provide mental assistance 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.020
 Colleagues of the casualty were from 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.730
 emergency call experts asked 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.980

 so the devices could without delay 

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:09.779
 on the quickest way through that 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:11.669
 terrain to the accident site exactly to 

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:13.650

 defibrillator and mobilization segment 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.400
 took 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.050
 travel with his fast drama 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:29.909

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.860
 life-threatening injuries faster 

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:36.029

 Of course I can with such an accident 

00:05:57.149 --> 00:06:01.110
 also come to internal bleeding 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.149
