00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:10.530
 Crochet road guide Amigurumi Hen 11th 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.910
 Let's knit an ellipse this time 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:22.010
 It is a combination of the make-up eye and the circle god 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:24.860
 The point is the knitting method of the first step following the making of the crochet 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.970
 Let's display the knitting pattern 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:33.240
 I will leave only the creation and the first step 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.240
 At first let's look at the make-up rice of thick knitting 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.260
 Here is the preparation 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.829
 Four 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.600
 Then a glance the chain stitch of rising 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:06.730
 Let 's weave the first fine knitting 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.730
 Pick up the back of the chain of rice 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.850
 You knit Hosoami 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:24.100
 Since the hill at the back of the chain stitch of the top rising 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.100
 I put a needle in the back mountain next to it 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:34.250
 The action of picking up the back mountain is quite difficult without getting used to 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.250
 Hold the 3 base in the thumb and middle finger 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.229
 It may be easy to do with an image that covers the needle 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:49.990
 In order to make this work easy , use knitting needle No. 2 or loosen it when knitting. 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.990
 It is good to knit 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:02:02.690
 Well, Komami rice was woven 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:02.690
 Then it is 6 squeaks, but this is braided with rice Okome and pick up the back mountain again and knit it 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:17.780
 In other words, here it is serious but without writing so with the living eye of the oval knitting diagram 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:21.160
 It is often written separately 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:24.740
 And the next seven years point 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.600
 The end of the eyes 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.690
 in this way 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:36.260
 Turn the knitted fabric 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:41.319
 You can see the chain's head So far, I picked up the back of the chain and got it knitted 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.319
 Let's pick up this head and knit this time 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:51.030
 Here at the beginning of this knitting yarn end 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.030
 Ami wrapped and processed 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.980
 Diagonal eyes 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.240
 Team name 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.700
 9 years 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:28.200
 11 people and in the same place or in widening stitches manner 12 th 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.200
 I will put my eyes on 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.430
 11 years 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.120
 u 2 people 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:46.480
 The last step is to finish the first step by skipping the crotch and pulling out the crotch for the eyes. 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:05.000
 If the Lord is connected, the rest is the same as at the garden 5 hits 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.000
 From the second row onwards, you only need to pick up the knitting head and knit it 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:14.650
 If you are interested please continue knitting the second row 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:19.299
 It was an oval knitting method that made more than a small size . 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:25.450
 Anyway, the wider one from the first make-up is the point 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:32.700
 Next time in it this far, let's close system or from in the build of the chain stitch 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:32.700
 We learned about knitting called Hirami or round-trip god, thank you
