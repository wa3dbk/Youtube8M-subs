 4 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.500
 Hello and welcome to the very first episode of mods and maps 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.069
 enable 12 17 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:32.659
 We're going to have a match today with the names that Mombacher cares about 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.180
 it looks good to look around 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.640
 Sorry about the app center I came from Bavaria 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.860
 Year as I am now I am mostly showing Thomas and maybe short 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.190
 explain romp 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.010
 is there 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.010
 to describe Halo 2 and 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.800
 - Ossendorf recognized 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.050
 So grab 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.170
 good and now always in the special weapons come the Plauen base 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.110
 and of course because it's Smet's murder, of course, there's a weapon 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.110
 this should not really give him the gripping cracks 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.220
 Torn to park 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.650
 a Spartan is like that 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.650
 Pölten 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.160
 at two peers and of course the Presto 2 Eifel must be able to get out of Halo 1 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.190
 yes I hate the guns 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.470
 not to forget, of course, the conditional stolen 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.470
 from Halo 1 use 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.050
 but of course now back to the Spartan Baser that is of course ours 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.400
 all darling 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.400
 were also bad 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.390
 to be proactive 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.890
 will therefore close again 7 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.120
 Halo 3 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.100
 good around 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.100
 yes, that does not change, not necessarily 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.670
 because of the fly is so easy times citizens the MOBA made small 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:05.860
 sightseeing flight 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.860
 You can see that we have done everything with great attention to detail 

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:13.499
 yes, there is also a second place thought 

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:16.499
 fortunately with explosion center 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.159
 no idea how the Cannes travel 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:21.779
 Core i7 revival 

00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:24.779
 also burst completely and now we move 

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:28.509
 Briner wall 

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:32.129
 and now so did Bosaso 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:33.299
 to form these 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.299
 The people finally at Protect's discretion 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:39.639
 the main culprit was weak 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:40.989
 Protest around 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.969
 Of course, there are also a few victims 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:44.399
 who is per capita 

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:45.789
 with socks 

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:48.829
 and her mistress old acquaintances from Halo 3 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:51.829
 Well, that is the old well-known one knows that the building sign 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.029
 only they have no barber turned on but 

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:58.029
 Bartel squares 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:04.029
 Despite it keeps plenty of Oskar Martens timpani fair, nothing can make the day what 

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:07.319
 wear 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.219
 tremble and hope that ours 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:11.389
 what the hell 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:14.389
 Euro and push the caps hole in the ground 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:18.569
 the channel system of your browser 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.869
 Percent does not lead us both straight to lunch 

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:26.279
 By the way, of course, there is also Botox without guns that is so 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:28.419
 now regarding the pug 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:31.419
 it's about Rothhammer 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:34.949
 Mr. Wiebe do not want to know 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:39.559
 of course to the usual suspects like 

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:42.559
 "Morning Glory" to the powerful Schwab shine 

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:45.599
 why not bad 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.639
 and per Tec DAX not missing at approx 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:51.639
 also adapted in the house Halo 3 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.680
 Euro and psychic and are the ones at the end of the tunnel and 

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:01.379
 get rid of the end of the Collège 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:05.279
 Euro what is actually with us now and looks through Nemo Bahrs I hope so 

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:07.279

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:08.950
 Edu 2 for the PC 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.599
 As I said I have to play online 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.989
 Dürr and percent 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.829
 Well as the conclusion of operating and brought funds will not us 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:17.879
 is boring 

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:20.559
 Shall I still film you away? 

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:23.129
 takes practiced called it gets on Russ 

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:26.270
 Hungary and it in my opinion too non-fermented a lot of fun 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:59.899
 over the euro 

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:25.400
 because he 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.819
 the Caribbean 4 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:29.539
 living in Berlin 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:32.539
 while a boy
