 after all is going on there we're just going 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.160
 started by reading the panels then the 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.500
 rules the temple of the jump version 2 so 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.539
 do not break or put two blocks play 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.330
 in peaceful me just had it filled under 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:20.009

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.420
 players 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.890
 disable the tnt explosion and 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.810
 fire spread 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.569
 thank you with two cases and thank you to you in 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.130
 any case to have sent me the map 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:31.300
 good game so play well the 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.970
 architecture so go defeat by 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.830
 norbit destot 62 and magic stone the red 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.030
 stone was made by magic stone and 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.259
 bape creates body like you everywhere 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.060
 of magic and help as I said 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:43.690
 just now by norbit destot 62 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.399
 corentin 420 and fred 62 270 so that's it 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.810
 for small info 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:48.250
 the map is everything is happening there 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.129
 will go right now so for those 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.050
 who remember the first map the 

00:01:51.129 --> 00:01:54.580
 temple of jumping everything was everything was 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.000
 tested is successful there is always a 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.410
 solution 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.149
 so whoever remembers the 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.289
 first map the jump temple I can 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:03.520
 you will see how it goes with 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.660
 pieces of jumping parts everything 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.340
 just that you're going to pass so he 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.739
 is there I think there are six pieces to 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.090
 move on and where each time the end of 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.590
 this piece must have a lever that goes 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.849
 unlock the next level and so 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.920
 immediately bought the kart here and here 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:20.590
 institutes so you go you go 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.360
 have to advance like that in the map to 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.590
 every time a one level takes you to 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.500
 a lever that allows you to 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.720
 unlock the following areas 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.250
 so we will also read here then route 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.630
 1 2 3 so we will start with the not 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.010
 for one moreover we will see that the 1 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.520
 we I think about on the video of 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.810
 presentation 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.820
 I will leave you the pleasure of 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.170
 discover the other you must 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.700
 make the route 1 to access the 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.130
 second and so on 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.570
 up to the final level course 4 5 6 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.720
 so there you have the worrying level 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.590
 the level 2 that's here in front I know 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.209
 plus what it's going to see them all from 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.180
 following the final room so that will be 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.400
 really at the end here we have the course 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.370
 number 6 passes be the number route 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.600
 5 I think that's it and the course 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.890
 number 4 and so on at 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.080
 every time you go to finish 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.250
 1-1 levels you are going to have a 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.709
 little lever at the end we'll see that 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.910
 continued for the for the course one who 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.709
 is called warm up but that for me 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.720
 will be a good challenge challenge of the year at 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.410
 sound level we can not I try not 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.190
 stolen I will try to do it 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.870
 correctly 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.720
 and so we saw it's just 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.830
 seals finally small ones are realized 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.090
 during this one I got galley and 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.140
 when I tried the map any value 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.760
 it's really aouedj and I was going 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.700
 say the first time but no no no 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.570
 will we will take to several times 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.850
 so there you have seen I flew away 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.140
 1 it's normal I'm creative 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.020
 did not miss creative people played 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.370
 in survival and peaceful 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.140
 during the second stroke it's still 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.430
 beautiful so that one I'm not sure that 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.080
 I do it honestly I think I have 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:46.680
 really flew to the end if I 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:47.850
 the spleen olefin hair mutant made 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.450
 little things would be that I have trouble in 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.450
 speak at the same time 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.620
 I'm going I'm an honest hero 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.580
 for me I'm a big time and so 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.320
 seeing her we come to a small 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.330
 room like that end that will us 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.740
 enable to activate the lever we are going 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.210
 activated right away and from 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.410
 unlock the room 2 we will go 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:08.860
 see it right now the door had to open 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.290
 normally 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.430
 so I flew so the only thing that 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.160
 I think it's a pity that 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.269
 when we get there yes finally 2 at the end of 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.100
 course there is not something 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.450
 thing to come back faster you 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.799
 is not a corridor on the side that we 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.930
 would make it easier to return to 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.100
 the state hall it might be necessary 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.300
 something like that maybe for the 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.130
 v3 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.240
 do we ever know and so here you are 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.370
 see it's going to unlock the room 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.510
 number two so just wait for a guy 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.610
 just show you the beginning of the 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.800
 week number 2 I will not do it I 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.450
 you will leave the surprise of the rest but 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.410
 here we are staying here 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.960
 so where there were plenty of 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:44.200
 food in the coffers really 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.669
 what to do to survive and and that's it 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.380
 so the weary voice and its beginnings of the 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:48.940
 room number 2 which there are others 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.860
 things there further down there that's 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.120
 you go down a little bit will be well 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.950
 jumping it will not be missed for the 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.940
 fall there is so there is a map 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.500
 so sault for those who love them 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.970
 self furniture is pretty good 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.220
 we have a real small course we have a real 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.790
 little a little way to make 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.419
 so things are pretty good and 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.150
 that's all I have to tell you in 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:09.040
 done on the temple of the jump no one will not 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.930
 no no no good bah so much you 're here 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.400
 will have him the spawn room that is 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.100
 right here at the same time you're just at 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.380
 side so just a little trick too we get it 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:21.070
 return to departure as much as we go 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.790
 break the emerald blog so we're going 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.840
 go back to the start I just wanted 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.520
 tell you something I think I did 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.960
 not say at the beginning of the video in case 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.850
 level of the starting spawn because we have 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.700
 a little bit of homes with some 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:33.460
 homes of little worries at times 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:35.680
 you 're going to appear on the other side what 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.030
 that you appeared here in fact in 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.070
 this area here or just below 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.150
 so the room the spawn is just a whole 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.530
 little bit limited actually I would have done 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.210
 they hold a little bit because we 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.530
 spoke often in one word he appears 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.110
 choice guy launched the map in any case I 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:48.790
 appeared on the side so low pardon 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.169
 do not hesitate to put yourself in creative 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.400
 initially to be able 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:53.770
 simply go back to the real 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.640
 spawn room that's right there ben 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.130
 here I think I told you everything 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.870
