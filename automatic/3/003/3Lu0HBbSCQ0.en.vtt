00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.520 
kind of a complaint against it is I wish
that<00:03:37.639> the<00:03:38.180> hands<00:03:38.419> just<00:03:38.720> tell<00:03:38.870> them<00:03:39.049> a<00:03:39.079> little

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
that the hands just tell them a little

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.390 
that the hands just tell them a little
bit<00:03:39.680> better<00:03:39.799> than<00:03:40.099> they<00:03:40.220> do<00:03:42.069> but<00:03:43.069> you<00:03:43.189> can<00:03:43.310> get

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
bit better than they do but you can get

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.920 
bit better than they do but you can get
him<00:03:43.519> some<00:03:43.729> really<00:03:43.849> dynamic<00:03:44.030> poses<00:03:44.540> with<00:03:44.810> the

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
him some really dynamic poses with the

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.080 
him some really dynamic poses with the
blades<00:03:45.169> you<00:03:46.040> can<00:03:46.159> get<00:03:46.250> him<00:03:46.340> to<00:03:46.459> stay<00:03:46.669> in<00:03:46.819> right

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
blades you can get him to stay in right

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.849 
blades you can get him to stay in right
so<00:03:47.689> you<00:03:47.840> can<00:03:47.989> hold<00:03:48.199> him<00:03:48.290> like<00:03:48.409> this<00:03:48.439> or

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859

so you can hold him like this or
whatever<00:03:49.900> also<00:03:50.900> you<00:03:50.959> can<00:03:51.409> do<00:03:51.680> his<00:03:51.949> rider
