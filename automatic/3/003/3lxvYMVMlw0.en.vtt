00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
I'm going to go do the same thing

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.850 
I'm going to go do the same thing
opposite<00:01:23.280> side<00:01:27.350> now<00:01:28.350> we're<00:01:28.470> going<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.650> end

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
opposite side now we're going to end

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.350 
opposite side now we're going to end
right<00:01:29.100> here<00:01:29.430> we're<00:01:29.610> going<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.790> double<00:01:30.119> wrap<00:01:30.299> it

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
right here we're going to double wrap it

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.700 
right here we're going to double wrap it
you<00:01:33.360> have<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.600> keep<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:33.960> into<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.380> ground<00:01:34.590> a

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
you have to keep that into the ground a

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.550 
you have to keep that into the ground a
little<00:01:34.799> more<00:01:37.430> but<00:01:38.430> then<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:38.729> go<00:01:38.850> back<00:01:38.880> and

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
little more but then you go back and

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.140 
little more but then you go back and
when<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.650> go<00:01:40.740> back<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.009> go<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.310> opposite<00:01:41.909> so

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
when you go back you go the opposite so

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.859 
when you go back you go the opposite so
basically<00:01:42.630> in<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.930> middle<00:01:43.399> it's<00:01:44.399> going<00:01:44.640> to

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
basically in the middle it's going to

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.929 
basically in the middle it's going to
just<00:01:45.869> go<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.110> crisscross<00:01:46.520> it's<00:01:47.520> important

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
just go to crisscross it's important

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.520 
just go to crisscross it's important
that<00:01:48.060> across<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.630> somewhere<00:01:49.049> in<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.259> middle

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
that across is somewhere in the middle

00:01:49.530 --> 00:02:01.590 
that across is somewhere in the middle
right<00:01:49.619> there<00:01:50.270> okay

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.060 

see<00:02:02.600> how<00:02:02.659> tight<00:02:02.719> those<00:02:03.110> are<00:02:03.320> really<00:02:03.740> really
