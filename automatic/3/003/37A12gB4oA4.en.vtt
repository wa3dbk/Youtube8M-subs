hi<00:00:06.100> tile<00:00:06.640> from<00:00:07.000> inter-facility<00:00:07.510> here<00:00:08.109> today

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:08.740 
hi tile from inter-facility here today

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.760 
hi tile from inter-facility here today
we're<00:00:09.250> gonna<00:00:09.520> talk<00:00:09.910> about<00:00:10.260> United<00:00:11.260> Airlines

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:11.770 
we're gonna talk about United Airlines

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:16.289 
we're gonna talk about United Airlines
flight<00:00:12.299> 962<00:00:13.299> and<00:00:13.600> the<00:00:14.379> $2<00:00:15.100> headphones<00:00:15.820> I<00:00:16.119> got

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:16.299 
flight 962 and the $2 headphones I got

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.080 
flight 962 and the $2 headphones I got
on<00:00:16.570> that<00:00:16.949> journey

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.090 
on that journey

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:27.150 
on that journey
these<00:00:19.750> are<00:00:21.780> wretched<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:25.570> suppose<00:00:26.350> for<00:00:26.590> $2<00:00:27.039> you

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
these are wretched I suppose for $2 you

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.710 
these are wretched I suppose for $2 you
can't<00:00:27.370> expect<00:00:27.820> too<00:00:28.060> much<00:00:28.530> and<00:00:29.530> they're

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
can't expect too much and they're

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.150 
can't expect too much and they're
they're<00:00:31.720> certainly<00:00:32.230> not<00:00:32.469> going<00:00:32.770> to<00:00:32.860> deliver

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
they're certainly not going to deliver

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:40.590 
they're certainly not going to deliver
much<00:00:33.520> more<00:00:33.820> than<00:00:35.190> well<00:00:36.190> nothing<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:40.030> measured

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
much more than well nothing I measured

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.420 
much more than well nothing I measured
these<00:00:40.720> headphones<00:00:40.989> they're<00:00:41.980> abysmal<00:00:42.930> they're

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
these headphones they're abysmal they're

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.220 
these headphones they're abysmal they're
they've<00:00:45.430> got<00:00:45.670> just<00:00:45.850> an<00:00:46.060> enormous<00:00:46.510> amount<00:00:47.050> of

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
they've got just an enormous amount of

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.680 
they've got just an enormous amount of
distortion<00:00:47.649> but<00:00:48.430> the<00:00:48.610> thing<00:00:48.970> that<00:00:49.480> is<00:00:49.660> really

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
distortion but the thing that is really

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.160 
distortion but the thing that is really
amazing<00:00:50.680> about<00:00:51.040> it<00:00:51.250> is<00:00:51.579> they're<00:00:51.850> wired<00:00:52.270> out<00:00:52.720> of

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
amazing about it is they're wired out of

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.540 
amazing about it is they're wired out of
polarity<00:00:53.829> which<00:00:54.160> means<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:55.719> when<00:00:56.110> the<00:00:56.550> left

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
polarity which means that when the left

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.690 
polarity which means that when the left
driver<00:00:58.300> goes<00:00:58.690> in<00:00:59.110> the<00:00:59.440> right<00:00:59.680> driver<00:01:00.070> goes<00:01:00.399> out

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
driver goes in the right driver goes out

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.119 
driver goes in the right driver goes out
so<00:01:01.090> they're<00:01:01.300> so<00:01:01.989> they're<00:01:02.200> they<00:01:02.590> should<00:01:02.920> be

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
so they're so they're they should be

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.600 
so they're so they're they should be
pushing<00:01:03.430> air<00:01:04.089> in<00:01:04.689> and<00:01:04.930> out<00:01:05.019> at<00:01:05.170> the<00:01:05.290> same<00:01:05.530> time

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
pushing air in and out at the same time

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.370 
pushing air in and out at the same time
towards<00:01:06.610> your<00:01:06.759> ears<00:01:06.969> on<00:01:07.299> a<00:01:07.329> mono<00:01:07.630> signal<00:01:07.959> and

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
towards your ears on a mono signal and

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.190 
towards your ears on a mono signal and
they're<00:01:08.590> not<00:01:08.799> there<00:01:09.340> one<00:01:09.999> driver<00:01:10.479> is<00:01:10.899> out<00:01:11.170> of

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
they're not there one driver is out of

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.840 
they're not there one driver is out of
polarity<00:01:11.950> and<00:01:12.539> what<00:01:13.539> that<00:01:13.719> does<00:01:14.020> is

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
polarity and what that does is

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.999 
polarity and what that does is
completely<00:01:15.850> destroy<00:01:16.450> the<00:01:16.810> center<00:01:17.319> image<00:01:17.590> of

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
completely destroy the center image of

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:24.120 
completely destroy the center image of
what<00:01:18.189> you're<00:01:18.369> listening<00:01:18.579> to<00:01:18.909> and<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:22.649> I<00:01:23.649> think

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
what you're listening to and and I think

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.849 
what you're listening to and and I think
the<00:01:24.939> reason<00:01:25.389> why<00:01:25.600> they<00:01:25.899> did<00:01:26.649> it

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:26.859 
the reason why they did it

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:30.899 
the reason why they did it
of<00:01:27.009> course<00:01:27.249> it<00:01:27.369> could<00:01:27.490> be<00:01:27.520> a<00:01:27.609> mistake<00:01:28.859> but<00:01:29.909> but

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
of course it could be a mistake but but

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.569 
of course it could be a mistake but but
as<00:01:31.060> I<00:01:31.209> thought<00:01:31.450> about<00:01:31.630> it<00:01:32.189> on<00:01:33.189> an<00:01:33.399> airplane

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579 
as I thought about it on an airplane

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:36.419 
as I thought about it on an airplane
these<00:01:34.090> have<00:01:34.329> just<00:01:34.929> about<00:01:35.200> zero<00:01:35.429> isolation

00:01:36.419 --> 00:01:36.429 
these have just about zero isolation

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:38.519 
these have just about zero isolation
there's<00:01:36.670> a<00:01:36.729> lot<00:01:37.090> of<00:01:37.270> noise<00:01:37.479> there<00:01:37.929> they<00:01:38.259> know

00:01:38.519 --> 00:01:38.529 
there's a lot of noise there they know

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:40.620 
there's a lot of noise there they know
these<00:01:38.799> headphones<00:01:39.069> are<00:01:39.609> going<00:01:40.420> to<00:01:40.479> perform

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
these headphones are going to perform

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.929 
these headphones are going to perform
poorly<00:01:41.259> because<00:01:41.920> they<00:01:42.069> can't<00:01:42.340> afford<00:01:42.459> to<00:01:42.670> pay

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
poorly because they can't afford to pay

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.649 
poorly because they can't afford to pay
hardly<00:01:43.749> anything<00:01:44.109> for<00:01:44.590> him<00:01:44.709> and<00:01:44.969> so<00:01:45.969> I<00:01:45.999> think

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
hardly anything for him and so I think

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.489 
hardly anything for him and so I think
they<00:01:46.899> wire<00:01:47.139> them<00:01:47.469> out<00:01:47.679> of<00:01:47.889> phase<00:01:48.219> so<00:01:48.749> that<00:01:49.749> your

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:50.499 
they wire them out of phase so that your

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:55.649 
they wire them out of phase so that your
head<00:01:51.399> is<00:01:51.759> sort<00:01:52.359> of<00:01:52.479> jolted<00:01:53.319> and<00:01:53.529> really<00:01:54.659> is

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
head is sort of jolted and really is

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.149 
head is sort of jolted and really is
able<00:01:56.259> to<00:01:56.709> concentrate<00:01:57.669> on<00:01:58.029> because<00:01:58.509> it's<00:01:58.689> so

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
able to concentrate on because it's so

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.080 
able to concentrate on because it's so
glaringly<00:02:00.159> weird

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
glaringly weird

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.889 
glaringly weird
the<00:02:01.899> music<00:02:02.289> that's<00:02:02.439> playing<00:02:02.560> or<00:02:03.389> the<00:02:04.389> movie

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
the music that's playing or the movie

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.639 
the music that's playing or the movie
soundtrack<00:02:05.499> and<00:02:05.859> it<00:02:06.849> makes<00:02:07.479> the<00:02:07.810> this<00:02:08.200> weird

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
soundtrack and it makes the this weird

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.810 
soundtrack and it makes the this weird
Spacey<00:02:09.310> very<00:02:10.300> wide<00:02:10.980> image<00:02:11.980> in<00:02:12.430> your<00:02:12.550> head

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
Spacey very wide image in your head

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.240 
Spacey very wide image in your head
that's<00:02:13.330> completely<00:02:14.140> artificial<00:02:14.710> but

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
that's completely artificial but

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.070 
that's completely artificial but
definitely

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
definitely

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.380 
definitely
attention-grabbing<00:02:18.280> because<00:02:18.580> it's<00:02:18.760> so<00:02:19.030> out

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
attention-grabbing because it's so out

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.090 
attention-grabbing because it's so out
of<00:02:19.420> the<00:02:19.600> norm<00:02:20.940> so<00:02:21.990> overtime<00:02:22.990> here<00:02:23.410> I'm<00:02:23.740> going

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
of the norm so overtime here I'm going

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.620 
of the norm so overtime here I'm going
to<00:02:24.660> try<00:02:25.660> to<00:02:25.690> measure<00:02:25.930> a<00:02:26.080> few<00:02:26.350> more<00:02:26.560> of<00:02:26.680> these

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
to try to measure a few more of these

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.630 
to try to measure a few more of these
airline<00:02:28.630> headphones<00:02:29.170> and<00:02:29.530> find<00:02:30.100> out<00:02:30.280> if<00:02:30.490> there

airline headphones and find out if there

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.590 
airline headphones and find out if there
are<00:02:30.670> all<00:02:31.300> wired<00:02:31.690> out<00:02:32.530> of<00:02:32.830> polarity<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.850> help

are all wired out of polarity to help
the<00:02:35.040> audio<00:02:36.040> be<00:02:36.370> more<00:02:36.730> apparent<00:02:37.450> over<00:02:38.080> really

the audio be more apparent over really

the audio be more apparent over really
crappy<00:02:39.550> headphones<00:02:40.030> and<00:02:40.420> in<00:02:40.900> a<00:02:40.990> loud

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
crappy headphones and in a loud

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.260 
crappy headphones and in a loud
environment<00:02:42.090> I<00:02:44.100> do<00:02:45.100> not<00:02:45.280> recommend<00:02:45.970> these

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
environment I do not recommend these

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.060 
environment I do not recommend these
headphones<00:02:47.070> I<00:02:49.140> wore<00:02:50.140> them<00:02:50.380> for<00:02:50.410> about<00:02:50.770> a<00:02:50.800> half

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
headphones I wore them for about a half

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.100
