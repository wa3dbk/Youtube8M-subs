like<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.159> really<00:01:11.850> badly<00:01:12.240> like<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.869> it's<00:01:13.170> kind<00:01:13.470> of

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
like I really badly like it it's kind of

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.080 
like I really badly like it it's kind of
not<00:01:13.680> funny<00:01:13.950> how<00:01:14.189> much<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.549> suck<00:01:14.790> at<00:01:14.939> this<00:01:15.000> game

not funny how much I suck at this game
you'll<00:01:15.390> see<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.689> when<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.409> cut<00:01:16.650> away<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.890> the

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
you'll see it when I cut away to the

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.070 
you'll see it when I cut away to the
video<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.090> trying<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.570> out<00:01:18.659> on<00:01:18.930> the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
video of you trying it out on the

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.780 
video of you trying it out on the
simulator<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.710> just<00:01:19.920> didn't<00:01:20.310> work<00:01:20.400> out<00:01:20.580> well

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
simulator it just didn't work out well

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.690 
simulator it just didn't work out well
but<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.600> part<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.710> take<00:01:22.890> away<00:01:23.100> from<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.369> is

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
but that part to take away from that is

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.429 
but that part to take away from that is
that<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.180> means<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.509> they<00:01:24.689> really<00:01:25.229> nailed

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
that that means that they really nailed

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.100 
that that means that they really nailed
the<00:01:26.189> realism<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.240> physics<00:01:27.630> they're

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
the realism and the physics they're

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.920 
the realism and the physics they're
actually<00:01:28.380> using<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.740> brand<00:01:29.009> new<00:01:29.159> physics<00:01:29.579> and

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
actually using a brand new physics and

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.990 
actually using a brand new physics and
for<00:01:30.440> this<00:01:30.530> game<00:01:30.590> that's<00:01:31.100> different<00:01:31.640> than<00:01:31.790> what

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
for this game that's different than what

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.330 
for this game that's different than what
they<00:01:32.120> use<00:01:32.360> for<00:01:32.390> the<00:01:32.630> previous<00:01:32.990> games<00:01:33.260> and<00:01:33.740> you

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
they use for the previous games and you

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.070 
they use for the previous games and you
it<00:01:34.640> shows<00:01:34.910> you<00:01:35.180> can<00:01:35.330> definitely<00:01:35.540> feel<00:01:36.020> it

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
it shows you can definitely feel it

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.980 
it shows you can definitely feel it
there's<00:01:36.380> a<00:01:36.500> change<00:01:36.800> in<00:01:37.190> their<00:01:37.940> response<00:01:38.390> grip

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
there's a change in their response grip

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.290 
there's a change in their response grip
the<00:01:39.740> way<00:01:39.860> the<00:01:40.010> car<00:01:40.190> reacts<00:01:40.550> and<00:01:40.730> the<00:01:40.820> terms<00:01:41.090> the

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
the way the car reacts and the terms the

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.000 
the way the car reacts and the terms the
way<00:01:41.390> the<00:01:41.510> car<00:01:41.690> reacts<00:01:41.960> them<00:01:42.110> you<00:01:42.230> get<00:01:42.350> hit<00:01:42.620> if

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
way the car reacts them you get hit if

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.150 
way the car reacts them you get hit if
you<00:01:43.250> hit<00:01:43.340> someone<00:01:43.640> else<00:01:44.140> it's<00:01:45.140> just<00:01:45.290> very<00:01:45.979> very

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
you hit someone else it's just very very

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.850 
you hit someone else it's just very very
realistic<00:01:47.060> feeling<00:01:47.510> at<00:01:47.840> least<00:01:47.930> I<00:01:48.170> mean<00:01:48.440> the

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
realistic feeling at least I mean the

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.350 
realistic feeling at least I mean the

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
that's like but I would imagine that it

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.690 
that's like but I would imagine that it
was<00:01:56.600> close<00:01:57.080> to<00:01:57.740> what<00:01:57.890> I<00:01:57.920> was<00:01:58.100> experiencing

during my short time with F 1 2015 so

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.930 
during my short time with F 1 2015 so
you<00:02:02.180> can<00:02:02.570> play<00:02:03.280> fanatics<00:02:04.280> you<00:02:04.460> are<00:02:04.580> worried

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.499 
you can play fanatics you are worried
about<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:05.869> realism<00:02:06.259> and<00:02:06.649> feel<00:02:07.119> you<00:02:08.119> guys<00:02:08.270> have

nothing<00:02:08.810> to<00:02:08.869> worry<00:02:09.050> about<00:02:09.110> if<00:02:09.590> you're<00:02:09.800> not<00:02:09.950> as

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
nothing to worry about if you're not as

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.190

great<00:02:10.340> at<00:02:10.820> the<00:02:11.000> game<00:02:11.180> but<00:02:11.420> you<00:02:11.480> still<00:02:11.720> want<00:02:12.050> it

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
great at the game but you still want it

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.560 
great at the game but you still want it
and<00:02:12.920> you<00:02:13.100> kind<00:02:13.340> of<00:02:13.370> like<00:02:13.520> me<00:02:13.550> where<00:02:13.970> you<00:02:14.090> maybe

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
and you kind of like me where you maybe

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.750 
and you kind of like me where you maybe
turn<00:02:14.840> out<00:02:14.989> one<00:02:15.170> or<00:02:15.290> two<00:02:15.440> assists<00:02:15.770> that's<00:02:16.459> still

turn out one or two assists that's still

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.940 
turn out one or two assists that's still
there<00:02:16.970> it'll<00:02:17.780> still<00:02:17.989> be<00:02:18.110> forgiving<00:02:18.590> but<00:02:18.739> not

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
there it'll still be forgiving but not

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.380 
there it'll still be forgiving but not
too<00:02:19.130> forgiving<00:02:19.400> so<00:02:19.760> you<00:02:19.850> still<00:02:20.030> have<00:02:20.150> to<00:02:20.270> know

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
too forgiving so you still have to know

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.660 
too forgiving so you still have to know
what<00:02:20.510> you're<00:02:20.540> doing<00:02:20.930> as<00:02:21.680> always<00:02:22.070> I<00:02:22.340> feel<00:02:22.550> like

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
play with the wheel you kind of just

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.399 
play with the wheel you kind of just
want<00:03:10.030> to<00:03:10.060> do<00:03:10.209> that<00:03:10.360> I<00:03:10.569> understand<00:03:11.110> it's<00:03:11.200> a<00:03:11.260> big

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:11.409 
want to do that I understand it's a big

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:13.589 
want to do that I understand it's a big
investment<00:03:11.530> but<00:03:12.189> in<00:03:12.340> the<00:03:12.489> end<00:03:12.579> it's<00:03:13.180> worth<00:03:13.420> it

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
investment but in the end it's worth it

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:14.729 
investment but in the end it's worth it
because<00:03:13.689> it<00:03:13.870> just<00:03:13.959> adds<00:03:14.230> to<00:03:14.409> the<00:03:14.590> experience

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
because it just adds to the experience

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.069 
because it just adds to the experience
of<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.129> game<00:03:15.310> but<00:03:16.000> in<00:03:16.269> case<00:03:16.480> you<00:03:16.510> hadn't

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
of the game but in case you hadn't

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.199 
of the game but in case you hadn't
figured<00:03:17.110> it<00:03:17.379> out<00:03:17.470> yet<00:03:17.709> my<00:03:18.370> first<00:03:18.730> experience

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
figured it out yet my first experience

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.380 
figured it out yet my first experience
with<00:03:19.299> F<00:03:19.480> 1<00:03:19.690> 2015<00:03:20.049> was<00:03:20.920> a<00:03:20.950> good<00:03:21.190> one<00:03:21.400> hopefully

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
with F 1 2015 was a good one hopefully

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.729 
with F 1 2015 was a good one hopefully
they<00:03:22.569> keep<00:03:22.750> that<00:03:22.930> momentum<00:03:23.079> going<00:03:23.349> in<00:03:23.680> the

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
they keep that momentum going in the

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.970 
they keep that momentum going in the
final<00:03:24.099> product<00:03:24.340> of<00:03:24.489> the<00:03:24.549> game<00:03:25.290> hopefully<00:03:26.290> we

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
final product of the game hopefully we
