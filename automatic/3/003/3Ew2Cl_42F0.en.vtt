00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
lighting that's right a pentium d and it

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.709 
lighting that's right a pentium d and it
would<00:00:35.370> not<00:00:35.579> take<00:00:36.350> it's<00:00:37.350> got<00:00:37.739> two<00:00:38.540> gigabytes<00:00:39.540> of

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
would not take it's got two gigabytes of

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.590 
would not take it's got two gigabytes of
video<00:00:39.930> RAM<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:40.920> there<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:42.000> was<00:00:42.120> hoping<00:00:42.450> I

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
video RAM in there and I was hoping I

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.510 
video RAM in there and I was hoping I
could<00:00:42.629> run<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.110> dual<00:00:43.320> core<00:00:43.680> set<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.070> PCI

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520

could run the dual core set of PCI
Express<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.510> took<00:00:46.200> out<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.620> CMOS<00:00:47.309> battery

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
Express I took out the CMOS battery

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.569 
Express I took out the CMOS battery
right<00:00:48.120> there<00:00:48.350> if<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.800> he<00:00:49.920> set<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.340> password

system<00:01:38.340> utilities<00:01:39.000> here<00:01:39.920> but<00:01:40.920> if<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.190> go<00:01:41.400> all

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
system utilities here but if I go all

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.980 
system utilities here but if I go all
the<00:01:41.760> way<00:01:41.820> if<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:42.180> make<00:01:42.450> all<00:01:42.630> those<00:01:42.810> adjustments

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
the way if I make all those adjustments

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.140 
the way if I make all those adjustments
which<00:01:44.210> you<00:01:45.210> notice<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.750> can<00:01:45.810> adjust<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.590> date

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
which you notice I can adjust the date

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.840 
which you notice I can adjust the date
get<00:01:48.150> the<00:01:48.270> date<00:01:48.450> there<00:01:48.690> Jeff<00:01:49.400> I'm<00:01:50.400> going<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.730> go

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
get the date there Jeff I'm going to go

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.280 
get the date there Jeff I'm going to go
through<00:01:51.090> those<00:01:51.330> black<00:01:51.930> items<00:01:52.470> about<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.040> date

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
through those black items about the date

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
through those black items about the date
music<00:01:56.600> 2004<00:01:57.600> but<00:01:57.930> look<00:01:58.140> at<00:01:58.260> it's<00:01:58.410> all<00:01:58.590> disabled

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
music 2004 but look at it's all disabled

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.170 
music 2004 but look at it's all disabled
so<00:01:59.760> I<00:01:59.820> can't<00:02:00.210> make<00:02:01.080> a<00:02:01.350> single<00:02:01.620> setting<00:02:02.180> and

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
so I can't make a single setting and

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.290 
so I can't make a single setting and
then<00:02:03.720> look<00:02:03.960> at<00:02:04.230> it<00:02:04.440> and<00:02:04.470> read<00:02:04.830> it<00:02:05.210> nothing<00:02:06.210> will

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
then look at it and read it nothing will

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.889 
then look at it and read it nothing will
last<00:02:07.220> so<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.729> question<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.270> you<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:09.479> how<00:02:09.840> do

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
last so the question to you is how do

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.160 
last so the question to you is how do
you<00:02:10.050> get<00:02:10.290> rid<00:02:10.530> of<00:02:10.560> dam<00:02:11.310> security<00:02:12.150> is<00:02:12.900> there<00:02:13.140> a

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
you get rid of dam security is there a

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.440 
you get rid of dam security is there a
master<00:02:14.330> password<00:02:15.330> I<00:02:16.580> could<00:02:17.580> do<00:02:17.790> like<00:02:18.060> remote

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
master password I could do like remote

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.880 
master password I could do like remote
administration<00:02:18.690> is<00:02:19.620> actually<00:02:20.130> a<00:02:20.160> name

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
administration is actually a name

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.730 
administration is actually a name
so<00:02:21.010> somebody<00:02:21.430> could<00:02:22.080> if<00:02:23.080> they<00:02:23.319> know<00:02:23.500> the

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
so somebody could if they know the

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.630 
so somebody could if they know the
system<00:02:24.580> I<00:02:24.910> guess<00:02:25.650> here's<00:02:26.650> here's<00:02:27.250> what<00:02:27.340> I<00:02:27.490> got

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
system I guess here's here's what I got

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.720 
system I guess here's here's what I got
a<00:02:27.700> turn<00:02:28.180> off<00:02:28.360> this<00:02:29.020> stuff<00:02:29.380> here<00:02:29.740> used<00:02:30.160> to<00:02:30.430> right

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
a turn off this stuff here used to right

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.230 
a turn off this stuff here used to right
here<00:02:31.060> I<00:02:31.240> think<00:02:31.840> I'll<00:02:31.990> allow<00:02:32.230> me<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:33.760> system
