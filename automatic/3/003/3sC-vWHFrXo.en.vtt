00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.480
 and today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.150
 little gameplay on modern warfare 3 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.580
 then our channel has not always 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.550
 not done delete unlike this 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.630
 that many feared or hoped for no 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.920
 I'm laughing I hope there was 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.230
 no one who was hoping for his cream this 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.990
 would be a little naughty then 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.200
 I think that so far actÃ© vision does not 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.610
 delete no French channel 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.440
 unlike the English side where they 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.290
 do a lot of carnage we talk about more 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.360
 100 channels deleted per day good 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.550
 here is the French side still nothing 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.410
 I think so here we are happy 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.170
 activision-blizzard at midnight today 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.250
 to spot our channel and asked 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.290
 youtube to delete it 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.629
 we obviously hope it does not happen 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.570
 will not pass if it goes well 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.860
 it's our fault we've earned it we've 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.579
 played it we lost 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.440
 finally not for now but then there 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.200
 I already have something interesting to 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.539
 tell you the predator then this is the 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.250
 same as in modern warfare 2 put to 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:14.649
 it's much less easy to 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.740
 handle you could see it there in all 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:20.110
 case I have difficult Germany and the 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.630
 sensible hull and the sensitivity by name of the 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.119
 predator is very different from that 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.780
 that you use with your weapon 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.080
 so it disturbs a bit early 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.300
 e 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.370
 speaking of sensitivity I want like 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.960
 you specify that sensitivities are 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.990
 very different from those of black ops 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.360
 and modern warfare 2 if you take 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.030
 a sensitivity of 4 on black ops 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.310
 it will be the equivalent of a sensitivity 2 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.740
 on modern warfare 2 or on non 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.430
 excuse me I'm wrong I think 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.560
 if you take a sensitivity of 4 on 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.320
 modern warfare 3 would be equivalent to 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.500
 a sensitivity of 2 on black ops 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.210
 mounana by two so that's small 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.430
 change on that side then after 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.620
 it's me who says that maybe I'm 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.030
 totally cheat 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.190
 it remains to be verified as I tell you 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.980
 I had the opportunity so far to play 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.780
 two hours so it's not either a 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.550
 length of time long enough for me 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.320
 get a clear idea about the game then 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.720
 watch out there's going to be something 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.240
 very interesting thing i unlock 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.910
 my helicopter I'm not dead and there I 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.890
 re unlocks a drone you understood 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.630
 what did that mean if you 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.970
 unlock all your killstreaks and ben 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.239
 a new series of eliminations begins 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.769
 even without you being killed so 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.530
 it will make series 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:41.440
 even longer elimination so 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.600
 do you rejoice or do you 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.950
 do not rejoice because it will make 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.530
 a lot more icco in the sky 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.880
 unfortunately unless the enemies 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.290
 get killed what makes sense 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.379
 finally 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.760
 then this map is the map 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:59.060
 forgot no now this is my shrink 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.890
 tone here is the map that is located near 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.310
 from the sea apparently you see that the 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.890
 buildings are a bit of Provencal style 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.799
 old ones anyway and the previous map 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.900
 that we presented to you in the first 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:14.900
 part in live die case it was the map 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.780
 paris so this woman represents paris 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.700
 but his name is not paris it's 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.980
 well, I have forgotten the name now 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.440
 it's not the cat but in any case it 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.790
 represents paris i also had 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.099
 the opportunity to play on the map that 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.750
 represents london and notes that 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:33.200
 represents the New York Stock Exchange 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.670
 interestingly enough and so that's it 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.760
 a lot of fun at the maps 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.769
 which are well done at the level of weapons 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.379
 the cigar she is so far tears 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:45.409
 tested which I think has the greatest 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:48.230
 accuracy and according to point of tears that has 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:50.810
 the highest power is the ump 45 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.250
 so in passing there are some who have 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.700
 ride because in our first 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.139
 video high k play at the ump 45 but these 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.209
 people there may not have understood that 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:01.010
 it was his first part and so 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:04.230
 he had no idea that 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.510
 the ump 45 was again abusing 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.480
 on the contrary me I was hoping I end 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.819
 thought especially that infinity ward 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.030
 would greatly diminish the power of the 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:17.850
 mp 45 in modern warfare 3 a little bit for 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.070
 to be forgiven for the ump 45 which we 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.389
 have put in modern warfare 2 good he 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.970
 this is not always as it is 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:26.240
 powerful unfortunately so that's it 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.400
 hope they will not touch all that 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:32.130
 that they will not wait too long we can 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.330
 to suspect it because I can already see 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.330
 the community kg 1 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:41.419
 so what could I say 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:44.729
 else on this game the graphics are 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:46.050
 good I will not say excellent because 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:48.150
 that some games have better 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.919
 graphics I will not say bad 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.050
 because some giants of the less good 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:53.389
 graphics they are good that's it 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.380
 nice to play on 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:57.060
 the colors are extremely 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.979
 different from those of black ops on 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.510
 like or do not like me 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:02.729
 personally I prefer this 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.949
 colors a little more 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:06.719
 a little more joyous we will say a little 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:10.139
 less real maybe but a little more 

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:12.689
 happy is a game so I prefer 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:15.719
 like that after that is my personal opinion 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:18.439
 it will depend a lot on people I share 

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:21.900
 finally give apologize sorry for my 

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:27.240
 dog ego it's decidedly recurrent 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:28.650
 at home then little ones 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.020
 changes compared to others I 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.629
 know for example the iron action 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.729
 triangle triangle unfortunately for 

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:37.050
 the triple jumper well it will not do 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:39.389
 the style facts and that's doing in 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.889
 modern warfare 2 or in blackops that 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:42.870
 change of arm sarr change everything 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:44.819
 just like that should do it 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:48.029
 so that's a pity for those who make 

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:49.620
 tricks shot m ah yes by cons I 

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:51.059
 good news for fans of 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.059
 kiel girls two quick scoop 

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:55.979
 the quick scope goes very well they 

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:57.889
 are a little less assisted than in 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:59.749
 modern warfare 2 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:01.370
 we can compare them to those of coast 4 

00:05:59.749 --> 00:06:04.069
 that's the level of difficulty I 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:06.409
 compare to those of coast 4 and lessons 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:07.520
 feasible but hard to do you a 

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:10.159
 minimum of training 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.479
 I must say I do not fit in too much 

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:11.749
 for now we'll see for the 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:13.580
 rest 

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:16.090
 so here I am enjoying that the enemy has me 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.439
 given a stab there for them 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:20.900
 to tell you that stabbing 

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:23.240
 it's okay and year-long I also wanted 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.889
 talked about killstreaks so in this game 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.689
 there are strict quest packs so 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:29.240
 for example you said you say 

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:30.979
 sorry the big fault you say that 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.719
 you want to reach the pv the water and the 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:34.279
 game automatically select you 3 

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:36.080
 which is strict that will allow you 

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:39.620
 to easily reach the peifl or who is 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:42.260
 located at 12 kg in this game so that's it 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.850
 both it is both low it 

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:46.940
 will make it easier so it's 

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:48.050
 good as well as good after I 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.669
 I'm not sure we can 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.030
 to personalize it would be bad 

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:52.040
 news 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.690
 after I only have two hours of play 

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.100
 remains to be verified in any case 

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.979
 unfortunately for me the gameplay 

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.940
 touch of ace already at an end 

00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:00.740
 I hope you will have gentlemen where 

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.900
 he does not hesitate to put a small thumb 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:07.090
 green I wish you a good rest two 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.090
 days and I tell you bye-bye hi
