00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:04.160
 Rödermark giants fall are shorter 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.040
 so he does not expect it would have to but actually Schaffens Albers dampens 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.929
 sometimes make even with death buys 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:13.269
 nothing I try that 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:16.739
 with the mustard Kürner you have to beforehand what you have to do 

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:19.089
 pulled over by our shack 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:22.089
 with Kafe Marat visited one the very finer 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:24.990
 You have to cool in the process 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.169
 really round like this 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:29.269
 and that's when I started 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.220
 these can 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.370
 loud moment 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.370
 the knock must fall down 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.140
 well filled 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.380
 more in the box Bubikon have become beautiful freely 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.750
 the guides are determined 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.120
 for example, by going through and that is not even findable 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.120
 still life life 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.660
 because also life 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.660
 pretty much 100 grams 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:00.750
 are mild 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.570
 in the bowl 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.660
 but there you have to 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.560
 Coulibaly were pa I got a movie about that 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.360
 Best not the easy times down in the editing room Chopin the old movies 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.130
 can already now 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.780
 that's the old movie 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.780
 properly the Wallis derailed 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.220
 we are incredible 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.880
 all poured 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.480
 I already have selfmade 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.830
 then that was correct that was refusing 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.830
 three times of negligence 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.530
 Franz old 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.979
 and the other way that sugar has already been emphasized was one 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:47.730
 a little less 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.580
 and then the whole bucket of water 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.890
 that was even more than that means 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.220
 the heritage is shaken and there you are 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.610
 to pass through at this hour 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.770
 so music hears the crowd of course my break 5 minutes like break 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:02.970
 is that a lot? 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.720
 Calculator to help 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.069
 then it comes out, for example, out 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.099
 I need 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.599
 8 grams of sugar well so also Grasser medium term 

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:17.269
 that will focus on 900 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.089
 one hundred milliliters of Eschrich 

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:23.849
 and then the water breaks even the second free before others do it 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.489
 also a cheeky 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.489
 150 milliliters of water 

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:33.069
 and then sugar thinks the 8 grams 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.669
 Suck Rant and who would have thought Meier 

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:38.349
 and now you can and there are many steps 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.549
 13 00 clock instead of Monaco dpa St 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.269
 Everything in it and now Ulla Röhrs stir 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.990
 Schilcher actually made such a big timber trade clearly 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.069
 the IG Metall demand critics 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.629
 the sports official 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:54.629
 he demands since the beginning of the conversation 

00:02:57.339 --> 00:03:00.329
 the found ones wrong 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.909
 Let's see if the recipe on the Internet tuned 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:05.909
 how it tastes 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:10.689
 Schmidt already some masts are moderate and he was also something I have to go 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:12.049
 per patient 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:13.229
 so everywhere 

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:14.779
 that was not the highlight 

00:03:14.779 --> 00:03:16.689
 the committee saw the same 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:20.620
 of Brandenburg and the ruffle Kubrick Bueckeburg and the stench 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.620
 Trade chains smell 

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:27.409
 700 and judge 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:30.409
 and between two millstones that's exactly what happened twice 

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:35.239
 although at that time not exactly they have to slow down a bit with the 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:36.529
 camera 

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:39.529
 Yesterday you could see how the mass paint it 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:42.629
 there can be the hospital 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:45.629
 or again between two millstones instead 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:47.609
 burned again 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:49.399
 to file something else 

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:50.279
 we had stayed 

00:03:50.279 --> 00:03:53.699
 Fine one tells it once in a lifetime after the Flood 

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:58.429
 Fandrich's that's the way to miss the right ticket consistency and something 

00:03:58.429 --> 00:04:01.899
 although Duster tend so 

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:05.939
 Munich I have with the packages small Rosa Nintendos would have to use it 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:08.939
 actually also Ping Pong man valley 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:12.889
 and I was cautious about a spoonful 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:16.019
 against the um-co-author 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.070
 He did it twice so it will be Matthias Wissmann 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:23.599
 No, you see, that will be something 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.289
 There I would like to help Buckeyes Sammer that he was the first time, yes 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:30.719
 do not paint secondly 

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:31.759
 and again 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:34.759
 Stir Stir Stroke Paint Paint Paint 

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:38.509
 The dog can already be noticed in long-term 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.449
 mead 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:44.449
 is that? 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.300
 but there was something else that was quite as simple as this question 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:55.319
 then the finished ones are still hand-in-hand bottled 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:57.819
 I remember the mustard they told me 

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:00.930
 Besides, by the way, could be any taste 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.479
 every taste 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:04.200
 funny mix with bathing go 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.580
 So now I'm still trying out photos in detail I Cut Bornheim 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.909
 also separates 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:14.210
 Superb GreenLine make now I'm curious 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:16.830
 b guest 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.819
 but a little more I still have to push with the House Red strategically 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:23.819
 Continue to separate Alois Schwab from the banana and the taste from it 

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:27.319
 could be drum bit smaller 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.350
 and now I'm curious it's about time for the last one 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.330
 Turn and now 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.370
 how much at the bumps 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.370
 they find and 

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:45.800
 it's good 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.930
 the empties 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.439
 Takeovers are really great 

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:54.389
 but maybe a mistake and another photo says
