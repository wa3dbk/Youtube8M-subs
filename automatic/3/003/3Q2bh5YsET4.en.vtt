00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 then in this carousel of art what 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.189
 what happens is the gallery owner or the merchant 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.380
 of art or whoever holds a 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.290
 power of which is very aware that 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.740
 that is when I gallery owner 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.410
 I put something for sale in place 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.740
 for sale to someone an author or and 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.480
 his works cisco with mine with mine 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.160
 therefore operated without saying anything 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.429
 we are not talking about a critic sanctioned with 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:33.809
 my work that that author quell 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:36.690
 artist will have the opportunity to grow 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.550
 in value, grow over time, that is, worth 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.059
 worth investing in that person 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.510
 ok of this thing is conscious the 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.579
 gallerist and is openly or consciously 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.399
 obviously also in a larval way 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.829
 that is, any artist knows what to be 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.980
 sold at some stores 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.780
 of one means a click 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.350
 this means that the gallery owners e 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.730
 art dealers are assaulted 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.339
 figuratively speaking for many 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.070
 artists all trying to propose themselves 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.530
 proposing their work master look 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.530
 watch my work look now 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.960
 put yourself in the shoes of those who are human 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.280
 performs this activity 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.190
 put yourself in the shoes of a person who is 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.330
 constantly therefore targeted by 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.500
 who proposes his own work 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.380
 hearing him propose it as one 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.520
 important thing but to put yourself in 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.210
 someone else's clothes 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.930
 try to imagine how much addiction 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:41.710
 how much practice how much repetition 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:45.759
 how little novelty little desire for 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:49.060
 know can have an evaluator of 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:51.820
 when the artists constantly artists 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.670
 they propose proposing valid jobs 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:58.060
 less good horrendous awesome but anyway 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.979
 in repetition and in any case with the 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.759
 underground feeling that they are 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:06.159
 proposing to sell themselves 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.690
 then if he can put you in the shoes of 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.869
 a person who does this like 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.390
 activity and who has it as I believe the art 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.730
 but also how I work well if you can 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.250
 put yourself in the shoes you should be able 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.730
 to prove that your interest is not 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.130
 only yourself your work but 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.290
 mainly as if I went out though 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.709
 I went out to dinner as not potential 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.980
 partner mainly shares with 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.600
 demonstrate to know and interested 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.620

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.560
 speaking 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.170
 and therefore to have known of an arts of 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.190
 a gallery owner of a merchant of a 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.709
 critic 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.299
 the work his work his activity le 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.579
 things he wrote the operations he has 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.709

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:52.690
 of interest well this is the key to 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.760
 reading your proposal 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.920
 this is how you can 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.560
 approach yourself so as to be 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.870
 interesting because besides your work 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.670
 Interesting 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.150
 Click on the person who is you 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.950
 looking at the interest in passamano to itself 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.230
 same that is his own work with him 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.220
 to his induced his known to his 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.560

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.950
 and this thing is not marginal is 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.670
 important and decisive and if indeed 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:24.129
 you are an artist and a person who lives 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.959
 immersed in the art world then has the 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:27.220
 desire to learn about the business of 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.840
 other operators 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.000
 you need to know useful 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.500
 from other operators and you know them not 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.620
 because you start studying how it is 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.629
 he studied listlessly at school 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.599

 this way will work in this 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.640
 way 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:56.920
 your membership in the circuit will start 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.349
 of art because it belongs first and foremost 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.000
 to art and therefore to its circuit e 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:04.180
 the interest in the circuit that is the activity 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.880
 of others it is the spring that will trigger 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.099
