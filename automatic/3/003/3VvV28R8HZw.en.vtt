which<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:23.970> really<00:00:24.270> cool<00:00:24.450> I've<00:00:24.780> had<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.290> for<00:00:25.530> I

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
which is really cool I've had it for I

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.950 
which is really cool I've had it for I
think<00:00:26.430> about<00:00:26.700> five<00:00:27.000> years<00:00:27.300> now<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.840> I've

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
think about five years now and I've

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.480 
think about five years now and I've
never<00:00:28.170> had<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.500> replace<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.800> battery<00:00:29.040> and<00:00:29.400> it

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
never had to replace a battery and it

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.520 
never had to replace a battery and it
supposedly<00:00:29.910> lasts<00:00:30.600> for<00:00:30.780> up<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:30.960> about<00:00:31.050> twenty

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:31.530 
supposedly lasts for up to about twenty

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:32.959 
supposedly lasts for up to about twenty
years<00:00:31.710> or<00:00:31.920> so<00:00:32.070> in<00:00:32.219> which<00:00:32.339> case<00:00:32.369> they<00:00:32.699> can<00:00:32.850> be

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
years or so in which case they can be

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.720 
years or so in which case they can be
replaced<00:00:33.269> and<00:00:33.949> it's<00:00:34.949> no<00:00:35.129> big<00:00:35.280> deal<00:00:35.460> it's<00:00:35.670> just

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
replaced and it's no big deal it's just

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.639 
replaced and it's no big deal it's just
a<00:00:35.999> little<00:00:36.420> bit<00:00:36.539> more<00:00:36.690> complex<00:00:37.109> than<00:00:37.260> replacing

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
a little bit more complex than replacing

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.610 
a little bit more complex than replacing
a<00:00:37.829> regular<00:00:38.190> battery<00:00:38.870> I've<00:00:39.870> always<00:00:40.320> kind<00:00:40.559> of

gonna scratch it definitely does
especially<00:01:41.280> on<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.729> bottom<00:01:42.060> where<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.270> gets

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
especially on the bottom where it gets

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.499 
especially on the bottom where it gets
put<00:01:42.630> down<00:01:42.659> on<00:01:43.140> counter<00:01:44.009> tops<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.460> stuff<00:01:44.609> but

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.270 
put down on counter tops and stuff but
overall<00:01:45.990> it's<00:01:46.439> held<00:01:46.649> up<00:01:46.740> really<00:01:46.829> really<00:01:47.159> well

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280

it's only at its peak brightness you

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.959 
it's only at its peak brightness you
know<00:02:31.620> just<00:02:31.859> like<00:02:31.920> any<00:02:31.980> loom<00:02:32.370> right<00:02:32.579> after<00:02:32.879> you

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:32.969 
know just like any loom right after you

and<00:03:23.970> I've<00:03:24.510> when<00:03:25.199> I<00:03:25.229> first<00:03:25.440> got<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:25.709> watch<00:03:25.859> I

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:25.979 
and I've when I first got the watch I

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:27.289 
and I've when I first got the watch I
learned<00:03:26.159> all<00:03:26.310> about<00:03:26.519> how<00:03:26.639> to<00:03:26.669> use<00:03:26.790> them<00:03:27.090> and

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
learned all about how to use them and

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.839 
learned all about how to use them and
could<00:03:27.900> you<00:03:28.560> know<00:03:28.650> do<00:03:28.979> math<00:03:29.159> and<00:03:29.430> stuff<00:03:29.639> and

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
could you know do math and stuff and

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:32.780 
could you know do math and stuff and
I've<00:03:30.629> since<00:03:30.900> forgotten<00:03:31.590> entirely<00:03:32.250> how<00:03:32.549> to<00:03:32.609> do

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
I've since forgotten entirely how to do

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.250 
I've since forgotten entirely how to do
all<00:03:32.939> that<00:03:32.970> so<00:03:33.359> it's<00:03:33.479> not<00:03:33.540> that<00:03:33.720> useful<00:03:33.870> but<00:03:34.199> it

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
all that so it's not that useful but it

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.289 
all that so it's not that useful but it
does<00:03:34.379> look<00:03:34.560> really<00:03:34.680> cool<00:03:34.829> so<00:03:35.669> that's<00:03:35.790> that's<00:03:36.120> a

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
does look really cool so that's that's a

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.069 
does look really cool so that's that's a
bonus<00:03:36.599> right<00:03:37.849> it<00:03:38.849> does<00:03:39.060> have<00:03:39.329> a<00:03:39.599> date<00:03:39.870> window

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
bonus right it does have a date window

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.740 
bonus right it does have a date window
as<00:03:40.439> you<00:03:40.560> guys<00:03:40.709> can<00:03:40.889> see<00:03:40.949> there<00:03:41.370> you<00:03:42.239> don't<00:03:42.449> need

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
as you guys can see there you don't need

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.929

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
actually looks bigger than it is because

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.560 
actually looks bigger than it is because
there's<00:04:17.310> no<00:04:17.489> bezel<00:04:17.909> right<00:04:18.150> it<00:04:18.299> just<00:04:18.329> goes

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
there's no bezel right it just goes

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.750 
there's no bezel right it just goes
right<00:04:18.779> up<00:04:18.900> the<00:04:19.049> edge<00:04:19.139> here<00:04:19.469> so<00:04:19.620> the<00:04:20.310> face<00:04:20.549> is

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
right up the edge here so the face is

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.339 
right up the edge here so the face is
very<00:04:20.909> large<00:04:21.269> even<00:04:21.659> though<00:04:21.750> the<00:04:21.870> actual<00:04:22.200> watch

itself<00:04:22.830> isn't<00:04:23.070> any

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650
