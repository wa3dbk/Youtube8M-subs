so<00:01:07.590> what<00:01:07.740> we're<00:01:07.860> going<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.010> do<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.400> really<00:01:08.610> a

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
so what we're going to do is really a

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.570 
so what we're going to do is really a
three-quarter<00:01:10.409> inch<00:01:10.440> pipe<00:01:10.830> here<00:01:11.100> that's<00:01:11.400> five

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
three-quarter inch pipe here that's five

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.570 
three-quarter inch pipe here that's five
foot<00:01:11.790> long<00:01:12.380> we<00:01:13.380> have<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:15.050> 1/2<00:01:16.050> inch<00:01:16.260> pipe<00:01:16.619> you

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
foot long we have a 1/2 inch pipe you

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.420 
foot long we have a 1/2 inch pipe you
see<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:18.150> your<00:01:18.270> ball<00:01:18.450> schedule<00:01:18.840> 40<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:20.159> if<00:01:20.280> rip

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
see is your ball schedule 40 and if rip

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.870 
see is your ball schedule 40 and if rip
to<00:01:20.690> rip<00:01:21.690> the<00:01:21.840> line<00:01:22.050> the<00:01:23.009> one<00:01:23.400> side<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.790> this

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
to rip the line the one side of this

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.330 
to rip the line the one side of this
half<00:01:24.090> inch<00:01:24.330> reason<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.590> because<00:01:25.800> it<00:01:25.979> won't<00:01:26.130> fit

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
half inch reason is because it won't fit

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.399 
half inch reason is because it won't fit
in<00:01:26.700> your<00:01:26.759> 3/4<00:01:27.800> so<00:01:29.990> so<00:01:30.990> we're<00:01:31.110> going<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.320> take

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
in your 3/4 so so we're going to take

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.020 
in your 3/4 so so we're going to take
some<00:01:31.560> wd-40<00:01:32.190> and<00:01:32.310> we're<00:01:32.550> gonna<00:01:32.700> spray<00:01:32.909> the

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
some wd-40 and we're gonna spray the

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.810 
some wd-40 and we're gonna spray the
inside<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.600> pipe

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
inside of the pipe

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.580 
inside of the pipe
and<00:01:34.970> the<00:01:35.060> outside<00:01:35.450> of<00:01:35.600> the<00:01:35.720> inner<00:01:35.870> pie

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.160 

put<00:01:40.130> and<00:01:40.280> go<00:01:40.880> together<00:01:41.030> at<00:01:41.360> least<00:01:41.479> somewhat

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
put and go together at least somewhat

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.749 
put and go together at least somewhat
easier<00:01:42.470> than

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
easier than

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.989 
easier than
probably<00:01:44.390> be<00:01:44.509> impossible<00:01:45.049> to<00:01:45.140> get<00:01:45.229> together

00:01:46.989 --> 00:01:46.999 
probably be impossible to get together

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:50.800 
probably be impossible to get together
and<00:01:47.179> then<00:01:47.329> start<00:01:47.689> forcing

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:51.969 

it's<00:01:50.960> gonna<00:01:51.110> take<00:01:51.380> quite<00:01:51.530> a<00:01:51.590> bit<00:01:51.770> of<00:01:51.860> effort

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
it's gonna take quite a bit of effort

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.959 
it's gonna take quite a bit of effort
elbow<00:01:52.520> grease<00:01:52.700> get<00:01:53.000> this<00:01:53.180> inside

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:54.969 
elbow grease get this inside

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:56.580 
elbow grease get this inside
you'll<00:01:55.479> have<00:01:55.600> a<00:01:55.659> little<00:01:55.810> bit<00:01:55.899> a<00:01:55.930> little<00:01:56.439> better

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
you'll have a little bit a little better

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.219 
you'll have a little bit a little better
luck<00:01:56.770> than<00:01:56.950> I<00:01:57.100> did

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.050 

I<00:01:59.259> resorted<00:02:00.189> hitting<00:02:00.520> it<00:02:00.640> against<00:02:00.970> the<00:02:01.060> ground

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
I resorted hitting it against the ground

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:11.370 
I resorted hitting it against the ground
but<00:02:03.510> we<00:02:03.630> got<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.900> inside<00:02:04.230> so<00:02:05.010> all<00:02:05.910> good

and you mark out the quarter-inch mark
here<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.340> then<00:02:38.489> we'll<00:02:40.159> hacksaw<00:02:41.159> down<00:02:41.400> through

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.970 

I'll<00:03:34.690> make<00:03:34.870> this<00:03:35.020> as<00:03:35.200> nice-looking<00:03:35.860> as

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
I'll make this as nice-looking as

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
I'll make this as nice-looking as
possible

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
possible

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.180 
possible
after<00:03:38.690> you<00:03:38.840> this<00:03:39.020> file<00:03:39.350> then<00:03:39.740> you'll<00:03:39.980> uh

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
after you this file then you'll uh

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.790 
after you this file then you'll uh
you'll<00:03:40.580> go<00:03:41.360> and<00:03:41.510> file<00:03:41.750> each<00:03:42.020> each<00:03:42.500> end

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.350 

just<00:03:45.980> kind<00:03:46.190> of<00:03:46.250> round<00:03:46.460> it<00:03:46.550> off<00:03:46.730> so<00:03:47.060> that

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
just kind of round it off so that

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.170 
just kind of round it off so that
obviously<00:03:48.320> isn't<00:03:48.860> sharp<00:03:50.500> and<00:03:51.500> it<00:03:51.710> looks<00:03:51.920> nice

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
obviously isn't sharp and it looks nice

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:58.140 
obviously isn't sharp and it looks nice
gives<00:03:53.180> it<00:03:53.330> kind<00:03:53.450> of<00:03:53.570> a<00:03:53.690> nice<00:03:53.870> a<00:03:54.200> nice<00:03:54.770> finished

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.540 

and<00:03:58.450> you<00:03:58.569> send<00:03:58.840> it<00:03:58.959> with<00:03:59.110> the<00:03:59.319> 80<00:04:00.310> grit

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
and you send it with the 80 grit

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:06.720 
and you send it with the 80 grit
sandpaper

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.150 

let's<00:04:07.180> string<00:04:07.450> it<00:04:07.570> up<00:04:07.660> see<00:04:08.050> if<00:04:08.140> it<00:04:08.290> all<00:04:08.770> worked

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
let's string it up see if it all worked

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.890 
let's string it up see if it all worked
out

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.410 

I<00:04:11.930> measured<00:04:12.530> this<00:04:13.040> you<00:04:13.220> see<00:04:13.880> what<00:04:14.030> length<00:04:14.209> it

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
I measured this you see what length it

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.220 
I measured this you see what length it
was<00:04:14.540> you<00:04:14.840> walking<00:04:14.959> about<00:04:15.410> six<00:04:15.950> six<00:04:16.160> and<00:04:16.250> a<00:04:16.370> half

was you walking about six six and a half
three<00:04:18.800> lots<00:04:18.980> of<00:04:19.130> pipe<00:04:19.340> insulation<00:04:19.850> is<00:04:20.090> a

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
three lots of pipe insulation is a
