00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:04.210
 today for the interviews and give me space we try together with the actor swelling 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:05.370
 comic 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.180
 hello live thanks for giving us this interview certain workers o 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.300
 very important programs that are bulldozers and colorado cafes you can talk to 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:15.129
 a little of your experience 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:17.090
 then two similar species 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.480
 but at the same time completely different the first bulldozer was the 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.140
 my first experience and therefore, as in my experience, I experience the emotion that lasts 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.720
 for a long time 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.660
 and above all because the audience is a television audience as a bulldozer 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.809
 so it's not a single theatrical section where I used to do shows 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.610
 the public federation to live of is a television audience and therefore maybe 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:38.610
 thickness 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.860
 the applause laughter was driven by someone else and therefore this coldness 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.270
 the beginning is not a village I look at the camera my own poletti omitted from 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.090
 wise and it was a bit difficult to start but let's say and this has me 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.120
 in quotation marks sverginato amapola uguta but it is really so mine 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.030
 if you know my abc ha damon of television is passagio bar colorado 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.580
 cafè was very easy because 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.630
 accustomed to finish line bulb for camera I am the only colorado I could 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.350
 also disinterest - help of the cameras important in the public 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.560
 because king in the theater 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.890
 and therefore a completely new and different but wonderful emotion because 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.390
 you have beaten the public if you had ideas you go if I was not laughing moderate 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.260
 jokes didn't work 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.530
 2 dress costs for the panicucci and wonderful the brescia idem then ho 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.490
 done the first year with Alberto in the second year with bartolini a 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.990
 then I went with 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.220
 always with brescia that in the end adds a little bit of people. good I can 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.800
 really say what an unforgettable experience they were then 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:42.890
 of weeds that led you to work in RAI than in Italy 1 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.150
 it came from the advertising of some green cabaret festivals because yes 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.380
 participates in slices young comedians who want to get noticed is hungry festival 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.350
 inea 22 that of catani that of milan the winners hand a 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.909
 mensana class that we good thanks thanks to the final ascension you can say 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.720
 all winners attend this festival 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.410
 sony I go great second of confucius all the organizers 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.039
 and they have me alas 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.969
 they called it bulldozer so you think it is important for a young person to 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:13.480
 participate in competitions 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.739
 so I don't tell you when I am young because I am a fairly young parody 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.579
 fundamental for you too 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:22.699
 often present the Palermo artist runner in other cities where he is 

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:27.869
 the festivals are less visible and serve to make themselves seen to be noticed 

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:31.020
 why be fulvicin festival and I see you again vaiassa mensana 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.040
 here all the organizers of all the festivals most of all notary all 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.050
 theaters all televisions sony tables salaries the best occasion in my opinion 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.820
 festival 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.620
 a priori for the you have to have a product with a thing 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.280
 original a particular thing the rain downo function the classic 7 minutes 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.900
 because most of that in contests don't ask you in Cosenza about you must 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:51.739
 to give the best 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.109
 s Piacentini swimmer 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:57.909
 as it happened to me, I tried a bulb 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:01.079
 so what are the tips you would give a young person who wants to undertake 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:02.409
 this career 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:04.579
 d cabaret laboratories 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:08.499
 who I recommend as a friend in palermo am modà will arrive milana milana again 

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:10.110

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.539
 tuttorvieto padova therefore laboratories are for nothing

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:20.139
 site in these premises 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:22.489
 eskimo night xi new unreleased items 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.230
 a young man who finds himself aladin in this strung out of strength in 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.729
 this picture is found 

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:32.949
 to confront other people who help him to grow 

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:37.399
 improving these labs make you grow out of preparing here ten 

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:41.279
 minutes and then can be used for a possible festival in parliament at 

00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:45.079
