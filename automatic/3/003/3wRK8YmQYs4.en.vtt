00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
out to you it's not about how the

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.970 
out to you it's not about how the
procedurally<00:00:50.070> generated<00:00:50.660> world<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:52.020> like

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
procedurally generated world is like

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.920 
procedurally generated world is like
huge<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:53.969> it's<00:00:54.120> absolute<00:00:54.570> huge<00:00:54.719> so<00:00:54.809> if<00:00:54.870> you

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
huge so it's absolute huge so if you

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.760 
huge so it's absolute huge so if you
don't<00:00:55.050> know<00:00:55.110> what<00:00:55.199> procedurally<00:00:55.710> generated

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
don't know what procedurally generated

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.459 
don't know what procedurally generated
means<00:00:56.190> it's<00:00:56.430> like<00:00:56.910> minecraft<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:57.960> randomly

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
means it's like minecraft so it randomly

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.260 
means it's like minecraft so it randomly
generates<00:00:59.010> off<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.430> it's<00:00:59.550> just<00:00:59.640> rather<00:01:00.149> than

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
generates off so it's just rather than

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.180 
generates off so it's just rather than
it<00:01:00.390> being<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.690> set<00:01:00.930> pattern<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.770> just<00:01:02.010> sort<00:01:02.100> of

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
it being a set pattern it just sort of

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.529 
it being a set pattern it just sort of
randomly<00:01:02.430> generates<00:01:03.059> these<00:01:03.149> different

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
randomly generates these different

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.260 
randomly generates these different
places<00:01:03.690> from<00:01:04.080> like<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.530> trees<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.549> sea<00:01:05.850> to

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
places from like the trees to the sea to

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.210 
places from like the trees to the sea to
what's<00:01:06.450> on<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.590> makes<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:07.890> look<00:01:08.040> all

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
what's on it and it makes it look all

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.630 
what's on it and it makes it look all
awesome<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.119> really<00:01:09.390> really<00:01:09.689> cool<00:01:09.810> um<00:01:10.640> and

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
awesome and really really cool um and

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.770 
awesome and really really cool um and
something<00:01:11.939> else<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.450> talked<00:01:12.600> about

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
something else that you talked about

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.359 
something else that you talked about
which<00:01:12.900> i<00:01:12.990> think<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.290> really<00:01:13.860> really<00:01:14.130> really

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
which i think is really really really

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.550 
which i think is really really really
cool<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.299> can<00:01:15.450> go<00:01:15.630> from<00:01:15.990> water

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
cool is that you can go from water

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.820 
cool is that you can go from water
straight<00:01:17.549> up<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.759> space<00:01:18.030> no<00:01:18.990> loading<00:01:19.290> screens

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
straight up to space no loading screens

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.620 
straight up to space no loading screens
so<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.280> see<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.580> planet<00:01:21.030> off<00:01:21.180> in<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.420> horizon

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
so you see a planet off in the horizon

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.480 
so you see a planet off in the horizon
you<00:01:22.049> can<00:01:22.229> go<00:01:22.350> over<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:23.130> can<00:01:23.250> fly

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
you can go over to that you can fly

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.760 
you can go over to that you can fly
right<00:01:23.520> over<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.150> see<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.450> he<00:01:24.900> said<00:01:25.200> this

saying it'll be sometime towards the end
of<00:02:16.370> 2014<00:02:17.030> if<00:02:17.240> not<00:02:17.510> early<00:02:17.810> 2015<00:02:18.470> but<00:02:19.040> they<00:02:19.220> said

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
of 2014 if not early 2015 but they said

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.880 
of 2014 if not early 2015 but they said
also<00:02:20.270> the<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:21.020> development<00:02:21.470> of<00:02:21.500> this<00:02:21.620> game<00:02:21.770> is

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
also the the development of this game is

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.520 
also the the development of this game is
a<00:02:21.950> lot<00:02:22.160> further<00:02:22.430> than<00:02:22.580> you<00:02:22.790> think<00:02:23.260> so<00:02:24.260> it's<00:02:24.410> not

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
a lot further than you think so it's not

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.740 
a lot further than you think so it's not
alpha<00:02:25.010> like<00:02:25.550> that<00:02:25.730> it's<00:02:25.880> not<00:02:26.060> like<00:02:26.210> pre-build

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
alpha like that it's not like pre-build

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.290 
alpha like that it's not like pre-build
it<00:02:27.050> is<00:02:27.500> literally<00:02:27.890> they've<00:02:28.640> been<00:02:28.790> working<00:02:28.910> for

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
it is literally they've been working for

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.150 
it is literally they've been working for
a<00:02:29.330> while<00:02:29.420> so<00:02:29.900> we<00:02:30.140> could<00:02:30.410> see<00:02:30.620> it<00:02:30.770> next<00:02:30.950> year

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
a while so we could see it next year

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.100 
a while so we could see it next year
which<00:02:31.430> i<00:02:31.610> think<00:02:31.880> we<00:02:31.940> probably<00:02:32.090> will<00:02:32.540> we'll

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
which i think we probably will we'll

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.080 
which i think we probably will we'll
probably<00:02:33.290> see<00:02:33.710> it<00:02:33.740> towards<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.460> end<00:02:34.490> so<00:02:34.880> like

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
probably see it towards the end so like

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.620 
probably see it towards the end so like
september-october<00:02:35.660> november<00:02:36.590> saw<00:02:36.710> time

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
september-october november saw time

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.520 
september-october november saw time
around<00:02:38.630> the<00:02:38.750> time<00:02:38.930> of<00:02:38.960> year<00:02:39.080> when<00:02:39.290> like<00:02:39.440> the

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
around the time of year when like the

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.220 
around the time of year when like the
best<00:02:39.680> games<00:02:39.950> seem<00:02:40.460> to<00:02:40.640> come<00:02:40.790> out<00:02:41.050> the<00:02:42.050> only

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
best games seem to come out the only

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.780 
best games seem to come out the only
thing<00:02:42.470> about<00:02:43.010> this<00:02:43.190> without<00:02:43.460> having<00:02:43.670> low

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
thing about this without having low

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.310 
thing about this without having low
periods<00:02:44.240> of<00:02:44.360> time<00:02:44.570> so<00:02:44.810> it's<00:02:44.930> going<00:02:45.020> to<00:02:45.080> take<00:02:45.170> a

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
periods of time so it's going to take a

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.690 
periods of time so it's going to take a
while<00:02:45.410> to<00:02:45.770> get<00:02:45.920> from<00:02:46.160> one<00:02:46.190> place<00:02:46.430> to<00:02:46.520> another

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
while to get from one place to another

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.040 
while to get from one place to another
if<00:02:47.030> you<00:02:47.090> do<00:02:47.210> something<00:02:47.420> in<00:02:47.510> distance<00:02:47.870> then

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
if you do something in distance then

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.480 
if you do something in distance then
it's<00:02:48.500> going<00:02:48.620> to<00:02:48.709> take<00:02:48.890> your<00:02:49.040> wall<00:02:49.220> to<00:02:49.370> get

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
it's going to take your wall to get

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:50.740 
it's going to take your wall to get
there<00:02:49.640> because<00:02:49.790> that<00:02:50.060> is<00:02:50.209> obviously<00:02:50.510> real

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
there because that is obviously real

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.150 
there because that is obviously real
time<00:02:50.959> isn't<00:02:51.200> it<00:02:51.350> so<00:02:51.560> you're<00:02:51.709> going<00:02:51.830> to<00:02:51.890> take

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
time isn't it so you're going to take

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.140 
time isn't it so you're going to take
your<00:02:52.280> wall<00:02:52.490> to<00:02:52.610> get<00:02:52.730> from<00:02:52.850> one<00:02:52.880> place<00:02:53.060> to

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
your wall to get from one place to

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.850 
your wall to get from one place to
another<00:02:53.270> but<00:02:53.990> obviously<00:02:54.080> you<00:02:54.350> can<00:02:54.500> stop<00:02:54.709> off

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
another but obviously you can stop off

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.320 
another but obviously you can stop off
on<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:55.130> way<00:02:55.280> and<00:02:55.550> you<00:02:55.700> can<00:02:55.850> play<00:02:56.000> a<00:02:56.030> lot<00:02:56.209> more

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
on the way and you can play a lot more
