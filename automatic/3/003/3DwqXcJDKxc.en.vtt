detailed it's it's made as a scale model
so<00:00:31.380> I<00:00:31.439> was<00:00:31.679> looking<00:00:32.040> at<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.250> blueprints<00:00:32.790> from

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
so I was looking at the blueprints from

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.030 
so I was looking at the blueprints from
the<00:00:33.540> real<00:00:33.719> helicopter<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.469> made<00:00:34.649> sure<00:00:34.860> that

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
the real helicopter and made sure that

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.970 
the real helicopter and made sure that
all<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.399> angles<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:36.210> all<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.260> details<00:00:37.649> are

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
all the angles and all the details are

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.260 
all the angles and all the details are
as<00:00:38.750> accurate<00:00:39.750> as<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.350> could<00:00:40.940> expect<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.090> to

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
as accurate as you could expect it to

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.549 
as accurate as you could expect it to
being<00:00:42.450> this<00:00:42.750> scale<00:00:44.000> so<00:00:45.000> we<00:00:45.809> got<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.230> main

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
being this scale so we got the main

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.380 
being this scale so we got the main
rotor<00:00:46.800> here<00:00:47.039> in<00:00:47.190> touch<00:00:47.399> with<00:00:47.579> turnaround<00:00:48.239> and

rotor here in touch with turnaround and
the<00:00:48.539> same<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.930> lets<00:00:49.140> him<00:00:49.469> go<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.829> right<00:00:50.129> here

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
the same that lets him go to right here

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:58.880 
the same that lets him go to right here
and<00:00:52.430> the<00:00:53.430> connections<00:00:55.340> with<00:00:57.079> tires<00:00:58.079> connected

unlike the truck and the trainer it's

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.649 
unlike the truck and the trainer it's
not<00:01:42.659> easy<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:43.049> build<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.380> on<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:44.210> it's<00:01:45.210> not<00:01:45.509> as

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
not easy to build it on and it's not as

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.550 
not easy to build it on and it's not as
sturdy<00:01:45.990> as<00:01:46.399> the<00:01:47.399> other<00:01:47.549> parts<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:48.090> can<00:01:48.240> see

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
sturdy as the other parts you can see

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.179 
sturdy as the other parts you can see
it's<00:01:49.560> easy<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:50.070> bend<00:01:50.850> certain<00:01:51.299> paths<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:52.189> the

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
it's easy to bend certain paths and the

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.280 
it's easy to bend certain paths and the
broader<00:01:53.399> comes<00:01:53.729> off<00:01:53.909> really<00:01:54.149> easily<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:55.079> is

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
broader comes off really easily this is

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.980 
broader comes off really easily this is
more<00:01:55.950> for<00:01:56.189> display<00:01:56.369> models<00:01:57.000> than<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.240> better

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
more for display models than a better

more for display models than a better
plane<00:01:58.350> model<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.860> have<00:01:59.820> made<00:02:00.000> building

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
plane model I have made building

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.060 
plane model I have made building
instructions<00:02:00.930> for<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.259> just<00:02:01.680> like<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:02.040> other

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
instructions for it just like the other

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.039 
instructions for it just like the other
parts<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.790> looks<00:02:02.969> quite<00:02:03.600> well<00:02:03.689> together

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049

this<00:02:46.040> is<00:02:46.250> still<00:02:46.520> they're<00:02:46.700> very<00:02:47.000> impressive

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
this is still they're very impressive

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.810 
this is still they're very impressive
and<00:02:47.980> that's<00:02:48.980> difficult<00:02:49.730> to<00:02:50.030> build<00:02:50.270> one<00:02:50.930> so<00:02:51.820> you

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
and that's difficult to build one so you

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.720 
and that's difficult to build one so you
should<00:02:53.060> have<00:02:53.570> quite<00:02:54.110> the<00:02:54.730> building

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
should have quite the building

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.430

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
builds in another helicopter which is

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.730 
builds in another helicopter which is
easier<00:03:19.550> to<00:03:19.670> build<00:03:19.850> and<00:03:20.320> much<00:03:21.320> more<00:03:21.500> sturdy

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:21.740 
easier to build and much more sturdy

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.130 
easier to build and much more sturdy
than<00:03:22.040> this<00:03:22.480> which<00:03:23.480> will<00:03:23.690> make<00:03:23.870> it<00:03:23.900> a<00:03:24.110> whole

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
than this which will make it a whole

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.490 
than this which will make it a whole
model<00:03:24.620> easy<00:03:25.340> it<00:03:25.690> more<00:03:26.690> appealing<00:03:26.990> to<00:03:27.170> play

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
with for children so if you're going to

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.830 
with for children so if you're going to
book<00:03:30.920> this<00:03:31.100> helicopter<00:03:31.520> that's<00:03:31.880> just<00:03:32.300> a

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
book this helicopter that's just a

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.910 
book this helicopter that's just a
couple<00:03:33.110> of<00:03:33.290> parts<00:03:33.770> which<00:03:33.980> you<00:03:34.310> should

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
couple of parts which you should

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.060 
couple of parts which you should
consider

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
consider

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.690

so<00:03:37.610> first<00:03:37.940> is<00:03:38.120> down<00:03:38.870> here<00:03:39.200> with<00:03:39.670> landing<00:03:40.670> gear

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
so first is down here with landing gear

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:47.220 
so first is down here with landing gear
I<00:03:41.350> have<00:03:42.760> used<00:03:44.650> pretty<00:03:45.650> pneumatic<00:03:46.100> tea<00:03:46.340> pieces

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
I have used pretty pneumatic tea pieces

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.970 
I have used pretty pneumatic tea pieces
and<00:03:49.270> they<00:03:50.270> are<00:03:50.450> not<00:03:50.630> currently<00:03:51.080> on<00:03:51.290> this<00:03:51.590> model

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
and they are not currently on this model

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.360 
and they are not currently on this model
but<00:03:52.910> I<00:03:53.180> recommend<00:03:53.690> using<00:03:53.930> a<00:03:54.320> flexible<00:03:55.040> hose

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
but I recommend using a flexible hose

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.560 
but I recommend using a flexible hose
instead<00:03:56.000> we're<00:03:56.630> cutting<00:03:57.050> off<00:03:57.650> a<00:03:58.570> 1.6

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
instead we're cutting off a 1.6

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.850 
instead we're cutting off a 1.6
centimeter<00:04:00.440> pot<00:04:00.739> in<00:04:01.340> order<00:04:01.430> to<00:04:01.640> put<00:04:01.940> in<00:04:02.060> here

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
centimeter pot in order to put in here

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.199 
centimeter pot in order to put in here
instead<00:04:03.860> of<00:04:03.920> using<00:04:04.130> the<00:04:04.400> tepees<00:04:04.880> because

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
instead of using the tepees because

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:07.300 
instead of using the tepees because
doesn't<00:04:05.420> make<00:04:05.750> the<00:04:06.290> connection<00:04:06.739> to<00:04:07.190> the

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
doesn't make the connection to the

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.180 
doesn't make the connection to the
trader<00:04:07.550> much<00:04:07.850> better<00:04:08.120> and<00:04:08.770> it<00:04:09.770> will<00:04:09.950> look<00:04:10.130> like

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
trader much better and it will look like

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.280 
trader much better and it will look like
the<00:04:10.940> model<00:04:11.180> I<00:04:11.239> have<00:04:11.450> here<00:04:11.660> instead<00:04:11.989> of<00:04:12.110> having

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
the model I have here instead of having

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.710 
the model I have here instead of having
a<00:04:12.500> great<00:04:13.160> piece<00:04:13.790> sticking<00:04:14.180> up<00:04:14.300> right<00:04:14.330> there

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
a great piece sticking up right there

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.780 
a great piece sticking up right there
and<00:04:15.700> apart<00:04:16.700> from<00:04:16.730> that<00:04:17.770> well

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.390 

if<00:04:21.210> you<00:04:21.360> want<00:04:21.540> to<00:04:21.660> make<00:04:21.840> it<00:04:21.960> completely<00:04:22.560> black

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
if you want to make it completely black

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.670 
if you want to make it completely black
without<00:04:23.880> smoke<00:04:24.390> blue<00:04:24.600> parts<00:04:24.990> sticking<00:04:25.440> out

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
without smoke blue parts sticking out

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.190 
without smoke blue parts sticking out
then<00:04:25.860> you<00:04:26.070> should<00:04:26.280> use<00:04:26.840> black<00:04:29.840> Technic<00:04:30.840> parts

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
then you should use black Technic parts

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.410 
then you should use black Technic parts
right<00:04:31.470> here<00:04:31.530> instead<00:04:32.370> of<00:04:32.490> blue<00:04:32.760> but<00:04:33.000> this

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
right here instead of blue but this

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:40.130 
right here instead of blue but this
black<00:04:33.750> one<00:04:33.900> is<00:04:34.110> pretty<00:04:34.470> hard<00:04:34.650> to<00:04:34.710> come<00:04:34.980> by<00:04:39.140> the

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
black one is pretty hard to come by the

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.830 
black one is pretty hard to come by the
technique<00:04:40.500> T<00:04:40.890> pieces<00:04:41.100> RIT<00:04:41.550> M<00:04:41.790> so<00:04:42.210> I<00:04:42.480> would<00:04:42.660> use

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
technique T pieces RIT M so I would use

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.670 
technique T pieces RIT M so I would use
this<00:04:43.230> piece<00:04:44.360> down<00:04:45.360> here<00:04:45.510> in<00:04:46.380> the<00:04:46.530> building

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
this piece down here in the building

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.310 
this piece down here in the building
instructions<00:04:47.400> but<00:04:47.550> as<00:04:48.450> I<00:04:48.480> said<00:04:48.720> I<00:04:48.900> recommend

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
instructions but as I said I recommend

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.370 
instructions but as I said I recommend
using<00:04:49.650> the<00:04:49.890> flexible<00:04:50.220> I<00:04:50.460> wasn't<00:04:50.700> dead<00:04:51.380> and

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
using the flexible I wasn't dead and

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.980 
using the flexible I wasn't dead and
it's<00:04:52.620> a<00:04:52.890> legal<00:04:53.250> technique<00:04:53.610> to<00:04:53.850> cut<00:04:54.600> the<00:04:54.780> Flex

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
it's a legal technique to cut the Flex

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.270 
it's a legal technique to cut the Flex
house<00:04:55.200> so<00:04:55.860> that's<00:04:56.250> okay<00:04:56.960> but<00:04:57.960> people<00:04:58.770> this<00:04:59.070> is

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
house so that's okay but people this is

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.230 
house so that's okay but people this is
a<00:04:59.550> fragile<00:05:00.240> model<00:05:00.750> it<00:05:01.110> comes<00:05:01.730> apart<00:05:02.730> really

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
a fragile model it comes apart really

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.350 
a fragile model it comes apart really
easily<00:05:04.340> and<00:05:05.340> especially<00:05:05.640> if<00:05:06.000> you're<00:05:06.150> drowning

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
easily and especially if you're drowning
