00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
it is has been around for a month or two

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.869 
it is has been around for a month or two
it's<00:00:46.500> not<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.680> super<00:00:46.980> old<00:00:47.100> colorway<00:00:47.579> but<00:00:47.760> it's

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
it's not a super old colorway but it's

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.549 
it's not a super old colorway but it's
definitely<00:00:48.000> not<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.360> newest<00:00:48.719> one<00:00:48.899> but<00:00:49.440> here

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
definitely not the newest one but here

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.080 
definitely not the newest one but here
it<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.710> this<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.250> yellow<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.820> purple

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
it is this is the yellow and purple

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.920 
it is this is the yellow and purple
colorway<00:00:51.629> kind<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:51.930> like<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.110> LA<00:00:52.260> Lakers

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
colorway kind of like the LA Lakers

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.170 
colorway kind of like the LA Lakers
colorway<00:00:54.930> going<00:00:55.289> here<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.879> really<00:00:56.879> like<00:00:57.030> the

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
colorway going here I really like the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.599 
colorway going here I really like the
color<00:00:57.360> I<00:00:57.449> think<00:00:57.840> it's<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.489> little<00:00:59.489> bit

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
color I think it's a little bit

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:00.709 
color I think it's a little bit
different<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.059> don't<00:01:00.180> see<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.480> yellow<00:01:00.629> and

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
different you don't see the yellow and

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.740 
different you don't see the yellow and
purple<00:01:00.960> all<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.379> often<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.570> guess<00:01:03.570> it's

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
purple all that often and I guess it's

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.260 
purple all that often and I guess it's
unique<00:01:04.049> for<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.320> soccer<00:01:04.589> shoe<00:01:05.090> but<00:01:06.090> too<00:01:06.210> little

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
unique for a soccer shoe but too little

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.429 
unique for a soccer shoe but too little
talk<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.540> little<00:01:06.750> bit<00:01:06.869> about<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.110> shoes<00:01:07.290> the

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
talk a little bit about the shoes the

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.560 
talk a little bit about the shoes the
upper<00:01:08.280> on<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.430> shoe<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:08.880> synthetic<00:01:09.119> there's
