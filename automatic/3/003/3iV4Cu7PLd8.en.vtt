some additional features include are

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.940 
some additional features include are
much<00:01:25.950> taller<00:01:26.310> stronger<00:01:27.500> hinge<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.619> we've

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
much taller stronger hinge that we've

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.980 
much taller stronger hinge that we've
moved<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.400> side<00:01:29.579> by<00:01:30.479> moving<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.960> the

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
moved to the side by moving it to the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.530 
moved to the side by moving it to the
side<00:01:31.079> we<00:01:31.380> make<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.680> entire<00:01:32.070> structure<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.270> lot

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
side we make the entire structure a lot

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.899 
side we make the entire structure a lot
stronger<00:01:34.049> so<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.130> can<00:01:35.250> actually<00:01:35.549> see<00:01:35.759> that

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
stronger so you can actually see that

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.819 
stronger so you can actually see that
you<00:01:36.090> know<00:01:36.240> if<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.420> want<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.720> try<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.020> bend<00:01:37.650> that

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
you know if I want to try and bend that

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.230 
you know if I want to try and bend that
it<00:01:37.950> doesn't<00:01:38.220> want<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.430> move<00:01:38.610> because<00:01:38.820> it's<00:01:39.060> so

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
it doesn't want to move because it's so

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.140 
it doesn't want to move because it's so
tall<00:01:40.130> another<00:01:41.130> improvement<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.759> we've<00:01:41.909> made

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
tall another improvement that we've made

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.030 
tall another improvement that we've made
is<00:01:42.780> this<00:01:43.049> over<00:01:43.740> Center<00:01:44.630> lock<00:01:45.649> that<00:01:46.649> works<00:01:46.860> like

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
is this over Center lock that works like

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.980 
is this over Center lock that works like
that<00:01:47.100> it's<00:01:47.820> very<00:01:48.000> easy<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.360> open<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.720> close
