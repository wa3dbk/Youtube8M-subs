you're going to want want to run north

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.170 
you're going to want want to run north
along<00:01:49.430> the<00:01:49.460> shore<00:01:50.020> if<00:01:51.020> you<00:01:51.560> have<00:01:51.649> a<00:01:51.710> Bunyip<00:01:52.180> or

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
along the shore if you have a Bunyip or

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.029 
along the shore if you have a Bunyip or
other<00:01:53.630> familiar<00:01:53.930> Titan<00:01:54.530> whatever<00:01:54.799> you<00:01:54.890> want

I think there's a couple different paths
you<00:02:02.479> can<00:02:02.600> take<00:02:02.710> might<00:02:03.710> be<00:02:03.829> wrong

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190

and they will auto attack you for a time

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:15.399 
and they will auto attack you for a time
these<00:03:13.939> ones<00:03:14.150> use<00:03:14.299> melee<00:03:14.659> these<00:03:15.019> ones<00:03:15.200> use

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:15.409 
these ones use melee these ones use

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:20.289 
these ones use melee these ones use
range<00:03:15.939> so<00:03:16.939> um<00:03:17.209> and<00:03:18.129> using<00:03:19.129> a<00:03:19.189> Canon<00:03:19.430> here<00:03:19.760> is<00:03:19.939> is

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
range so um and using a Canon here is is

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.990 
range so um and using a Canon here is is
a<00:03:20.659> really<00:03:21.140> good<00:03:21.260> idea<00:03:21.319> the<00:03:22.250> only<00:03:22.400> thing<00:03:22.579> is<00:03:22.670> is

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
a really good idea the only thing is is

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.880 
a really good idea the only thing is is
it<00:03:23.329> can<00:03:23.450> be<00:03:23.569> expensive<00:03:23.900> because<00:03:24.379> you<00:03:24.769> know

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
it can be expensive because you know

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.670 
it can be expensive because you know
canons<00:03:25.790> use<00:03:26.090> cannonballs<00:03:26.870> and<00:03:27.140> you<00:03:27.500> don't

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
canons use cannonballs and you don't

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.250 
canons use cannonballs and you don't
have<00:03:27.769> an<00:03:27.890> infinite<00:03:28.099> supply<00:03:28.370> of<00:03:28.549> those<00:03:28.870> so<00:03:29.870> um

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.629 

yep<00:03:33.260> and<00:03:36.040> pretty<00:03:37.040> much<00:03:37.099> when<00:03:37.310> you<00:03:37.400> want<00:03:37.549> to

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
can use whatever you want there are a

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.129 
can use whatever you want there are a
few<00:03:58.909> different<00:03:59.000> methods<00:03:59.419> for<00:03:59.540> getting<00:03:59.599> here<00:03:59.930> I

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:00.139 
few different methods for getting here I

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:01.720 
few different methods for getting here I
just<00:04:00.409> think<00:04:00.590> that<00:04:00.620> that<00:04:00.859> is<00:04:01.010> the<00:04:01.129> fastest<00:04:01.489> one

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
just think that that is the fastest one

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.589 
just think that that is the fastest one
and<00:04:03.760> basically<00:04:04.760> if<00:04:05.000> you<00:04:05.120> start<00:04:05.299> going<00:04:05.389> to<00:04:05.510> hurt

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
and basically if you start going to hurt

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:06.909 
and basically if you start going to hurt
too<00:04:05.720> much<00:04:05.840> if<00:04:06.019> you<00:04:06.079> have<00:04:06.169> soulsplit<00:04:06.470> just

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:06.919 
too much if you have soulsplit just

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:12.670 
too much if you have soulsplit just
fucking<00:04:07.340> flick<00:04:07.519> that<00:04:07.639> shit<00:04:07.849> on<00:04:11.650> also<00:04:12.650> check

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
fucking flick that shit on also check

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.319 
fucking flick that shit on also check
this<00:04:12.979> one<00:04:13.129> so<00:04:13.280> we<00:04:13.340> can<00:04:13.459> get<00:04:13.519> a<00:04:13.579> good<00:04:13.729> heal<00:04:15.940> and<00:04:16.940> I

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
this one so we can get a good heal and I

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.060 
this one so we can get a good heal and I
think<00:04:17.359> they're<00:04:17.750> weak<00:04:17.870> to<00:04:18.049> stab<00:04:18.320> but<00:04:18.919> I'm<00:04:19.039> not

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
think they're weak to stab but I'm not

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.800 
think they're weak to stab but I'm not
sure<00:04:19.370> they<00:04:19.489> might<00:04:19.639> be<00:04:19.729> weak<00:04:19.880> to<00:04:20.000> slash<00:04:20.239> I<00:04:20.510> don't

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
sure they might be weak to slash I don't

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.710 
sure they might be weak to slash I don't
know<00:04:20.870> that<00:04:21.260> I'm<00:04:21.440> not<00:04:21.470> the<00:04:21.799> expert<00:04:21.889> so<00:04:22.370> and<00:04:22.720> then

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
know that I'm not the expert so and then

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.089 
know that I'm not the expert so and then
if<00:04:24.320> you<00:04:24.470> want<00:04:25.030> flick<00:04:26.030> that<00:04:26.060> on<00:04:26.389> and<00:04:27.099> yeah

00:04:28.089 --> 00:04:28.099 
if you want flick that on and yeah

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:29.740 
if you want flick that on and yeah
that's<00:04:28.250> pretty<00:04:28.340> much<00:04:28.550> it<00:04:28.639> that's<00:04:28.970> I<00:04:29.300> think

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
that's pretty much it that's I think

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.710 
that's pretty much it that's I think
this<00:04:30.229> is<00:04:30.289> the<00:04:30.409> best<00:04:30.680> method<00:04:30.889> for<00:04:31.720> diagnose

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
this is the best method for diagnose

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.270 
this is the best method for diagnose
it's<00:04:32.990> not<00:04:33.260> only<00:04:33.470> a<00:04:33.620> first<00:04:34.520> Slayer<00:04:34.960> but<00:04:36.280> it's
