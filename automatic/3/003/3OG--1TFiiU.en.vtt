and I hate to say it well I think it's

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.959 
and I hate to say it well I think it's
unwarranted<00:00:57.750> just<00:00:58.440> because<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.160> you'll<00:00:59.789> know

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
unwarranted just because and you'll know

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.459 
unwarranted just because and you'll know
if<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.210> watch<00:01:00.359> my<00:01:00.510> game<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.870> year<00:01:01.170> awards

last year and also my review for
Resident<00:01:03.149> Evil<00:01:03.359> 6<00:01:03.390> i'm<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.409> opinion<00:01:04.559> that

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
Resident Evil 6 i'm of the opinion that

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.410 
Resident Evil 6 i'm of the opinion that
just<00:01:05.400> because<00:01:05.640> something's<00:01:06.090> different

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
just because something's different

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.990 
just because something's different
doesn't<00:01:07.409> mean<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.830> it's<00:01:08.010> bad<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.760> should

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
doesn't mean that it's bad you should

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.300 
doesn't mean that it's bad you should
weigh<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.780> balance<00:01:09.890> something<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.040> judge<00:01:11.280> it

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
weigh and balance something and judge it

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.130 
weigh and balance something and judge it
based<00:01:11.580> off<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.880> what<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.720> not<00:01:12.780> off<00:01:12.960> of

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
based off of what it is and not off of

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.649 
based off of what it is and not off of
your<00:01:13.880> expectations<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:15.060> what<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.390> should<00:01:15.630> be

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
your expectations of what it should be

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.830 
your expectations of what it should be
so<00:01:16.470> resident<00:01:16.860> evil<00:01:17.070> 6<00:01:17.340> was<00:01:18.060> nothing<00:01:18.600> like<00:01:18.810> a

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
so resident evil 6 was nothing like a

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.539 
so resident evil 6 was nothing like a
previous<00:01:19.290> resident<00:01:19.710> evil<00:01:19.979> game<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.340> was<00:01:20.430> an

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
previous resident evil game it was an

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.490 
previous resident evil game it was an
action<00:01:20.970> game<00:01:21.119> we<00:01:21.420> all<00:01:21.600> accept<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.200> and

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
action game we all accept that and

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.530 
action game we all accept that and
because<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.580> there's<00:01:23.880> such<00:01:24.090> negativity

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
because of that there's such negativity

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.929 
because of that there's such negativity
associated<00:01:25.049> with<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.619> franchise<00:01:26.189> well

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
associated with the franchise well

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.630 
associated with the franchise well
resident<00:01:27.390> evil<00:01:27.630> revelations<00:01:27.810> in<00:01:28.650> my<00:01:29.220> opinion

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
resident evil revelations in my opinion

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.510 
resident evil revelations in my opinion
actually<00:01:30.210> brought<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.290> franchise<00:01:31.799> back<00:01:32.280> to

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
actually brought the franchise back to

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.370 
actually brought the franchise back to
that<00:01:32.670> level<00:01:32.970> where<00:01:33.270> people<00:01:33.299> really<00:01:33.810> like<00:01:34.170> this

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
that level where people really like this

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.530 
that level where people really like this
so<00:01:34.560> we're<00:01:34.740> talking<00:01:34.920> back<00:01:35.610> in<00:01:35.790> Resident<00:01:36.270> Evil<00:01:36.509> 4

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
so we're talking back in Resident Evil 4

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.399 
so we're talking back in Resident Evil 4
days<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.920> gameplay<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.490> actually<00:01:39.090> extremely

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
days the gameplay is actually extremely

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.170 
days the gameplay is actually extremely
reminiscent<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.439> Resident<00:01:40.860> Evil<00:01:41.100> 4<00:01:41.130> you're<00:01:42.000> in

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
reminiscent of Resident Evil 4 you're in

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.060 
reminiscent of Resident Evil 4 you're in
closed<00:01:42.750> corridors<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.560> never<00:01:43.740> know<00:01:43.890> where

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
closed corridors you never know where

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.350 
closed corridors you never know where
there's<00:01:44.189> going<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.399> be<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.520> monster<00:01:44.759> jumping

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
there's going to be a monster jumping

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.609 
there's going to be a monster jumping
around<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.689> next<00:01:45.899> corner<00:01:46.079> there's<00:01:46.439> not<00:01:46.590> a

around the next corner there's not a

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.950 
around the next corner there's not a
ridiculous<00:01:47.490> amount<00:01:47.579> of<00:01:47.820> 4,000<00:01:48.600> zombies
