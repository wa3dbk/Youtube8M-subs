one<00:02:41.110> two<00:02:41.830> three<00:02:42.330> or<00:02:43.330> and<00:02:43.690> the<00:02:44.560> idea<00:02:44.980> really<00:02:45.310> is

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
one two three or and the idea really is

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.670 
one two three or and the idea really is
to<00:02:46.000> building<00:02:46.450> improvise<00:02:46.930> with<00:02:47.170> that<00:02:47.350> scale

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
to building improvise with that scale

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.270 
to building improvise with that scale
while<00:02:48.489> I've<00:02:48.760> got<00:02:48.970> my<00:02:49.120> thumb<00:02:49.390> doing<00:02:50.190> let<00:02:51.190> me
