00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
rar files open up the Valmer X it will

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.160 
rar files open up the Valmer X it will
unpack<00:01:40.950> all<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.460> files<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.970> you'll<00:01:42.720> end<00:01:43.020> up

with<00:01:43.229> one<00:01:43.710> file<00:01:44.280> left<00:01:44.549> in<00:01:44.850> this<00:01:44.970> folder

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
with one file left in this folder

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.480 
with one file left in this folder
probably<00:01:45.810> um<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.890> it'll<00:01:47.130> probably<00:01:47.280> say

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
probably um and it'll probably say

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.550 
probably um and it'll probably say
something<00:01:47.729> like<00:01:47.850> Age<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.840> Empires<00:01:49.079> toast

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
something like Age of Empires toast

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.660 
something like Age of Empires toast
basically<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.649> need<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.920> mount<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.310> and

basically you need to mount that and

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.030 
basically you need to mount that and
that<00:01:54.479> sounds<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.110> lot<00:01:55.290> more<00:01:55.350> complicated<00:01:55.950> than

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
that sounds a lot more complicated than

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.060 
that sounds a lot more complicated than
it<00:01:56.159> is<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.790> just<00:01:57.030> drag<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.840> files<00:01:58.170> would<00:01:58.950> you
