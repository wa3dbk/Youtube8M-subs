 [music] 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.040
 Good day friends with you 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.100
 Alkonavtov and today we have small 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.830
 teaser for tomorrow's review on the new map 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.869
 on closed beta testing of tanks 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.290
 map huge map 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:36.129
 Kursk battle and then I decided to go on 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.720
 t-34 tchiki 57 there will be a review with 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:41.260
 completely different car 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.629
 but none the less to 3,457 very well 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.840
 suitable exactly for and straight to lose weight 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.880
 why because the long trunk length and 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.130
 high initial flight speed 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.700
 projectile gives us a very good 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.460
 trajectory the trajectory of the shot and this 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.290
 helps to take long distances 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.870
 unlike many other guns 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.119
 we need to take far less anticipation 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.420
 vertically and this of course 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:10.660
 contributes to the curve of the minuses we see 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.300
 on the edge of a good impact 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.070
 projectile multiple hits tank 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.560
 stands and still remains on 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.590
 These not terrible were machines that those not 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.560
 less it can inflict damage and 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.410
 quite seriously and here I am shooting at 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.119
 groove in four right because quite 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.490
 the shaft is closed and something needs to be done 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.590
 left here and literally from the very first 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.920
 shots with pretty easy on him 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.110
 I get if I had another gun 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.520
 there would be another gun another gun not 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.259
 it would certainly make it much 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.630
 relatively more difficult but here I have 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:47.590
 surrounds already from all sides I before 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.640
 By the way, not a single tank was destroyed here 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.810
 I am distributing from the turntable 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.220
 troechki three more shielded with 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.050
 extra booking 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.569
 well or birds millimeter cannon she 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.819
 certainly not decisive nevertheless apparently 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:02.830
 piercing shells they help him 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:05.410
 punch me here I put it still 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.920
 more degeneration stuck in the tree thought 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:11.530
 that she will save me but apparently not here 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.170
 reference account review anything so clean 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.180
 thoughts about the fact that the tank is very and 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.270
 to show yourself quite well by 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.330
 its good trajectory and principle not 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.989
 the worst edge here so here with wear 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.260
 Tomorrow video who like to put like 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.439
 subscribe 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.530
 Sophie day really changed in Mapo 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:35.620
 In many ways, my relationship and I became much 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.230
 more optimistic well all tomorrow for 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.469
 cars and see you on the battlefield yet 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.469
 until
