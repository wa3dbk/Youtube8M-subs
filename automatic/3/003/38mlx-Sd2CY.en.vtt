00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
obviously my step number one would be to

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.799 
obviously my step number one would be to
open<00:00:52.020> some<00:00:52.590> pot<00:00:52.800> because<00:00:53.309> we<00:00:53.430> all<00:00:53.579> know<00:00:53.910> hacks

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
so obviously my step number one is to

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.130 
so obviously my step number one is to
trade<00:01:04.769> because<00:01:05.159> trading<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.790> just<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:06.630> easy<00:01:06.659> on

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
the best way to play is is probably the

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.640 
the best way to play is is probably the
the<00:03:25.519> Barcelona<00:03:26.150> way<00:03:26.390> of<00:03:26.510> football<00:03:26.959> here<00:03:27.200> the

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
the Barcelona way of football here the

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.530 
the Barcelona way of football here the
passer<00:03:27.920> moved<00:03:28.280> a<00:03:28.489> little<00:03:28.610> one<00:03:28.940> twos<00:03:29.269> the

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
triangles around the defenders I mean it

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.000
