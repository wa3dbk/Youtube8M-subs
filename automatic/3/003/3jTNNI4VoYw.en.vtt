00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
doesn't look as good as the others

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:49.790 
doesn't look as good as the others
because<00:00:48.629> all<00:00:48.809> my<00:00:48.960> equipment<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.469> still<00:00:49.620> packed

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
because all my equipment is still packed

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.110 
because all my equipment is still packed
up<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.039> don't<00:00:50.129> have<00:00:50.280> my<00:00:50.430> lights<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.850> don't<00:00:50.879> have

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
up I don't have my lights I don't have

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.970 
up I don't have my lights I don't have
my<00:00:51.239> high-def<00:00:51.719> camera<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.170> don't<00:00:52.379> even<00:00:52.559> have<00:00:52.800> my

my high-def camera I don't even have my
decent<00:00:53.430> microphones<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:54.420> this<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.079> probably

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
decent microphones so this is probably

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.569 
decent microphones so this is probably
looking<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.770> sounding<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:56.100> little<00:00:56.309> bit<00:00:56.399> worse

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
looking and sounding a little bit worse

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.069
