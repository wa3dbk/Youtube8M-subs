00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:02.400 
have the scuff logo scuff seal fuzhou
obviously<00:03:57.140> and<00:03:59.200> the<00:04:00.200> good<00:04:00.380> old<00:04:00.530> hook<00:04:00.830> paddles

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
obviously and the good old hook paddles

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.860 
obviously and the good old hook paddles
and<00:04:03.410> you<00:04:03.530> can<00:04:03.650> see<00:04:04.420> you<00:04:05.420> on<00:04:05.540> the<00:04:05.690> other<00:04:05.720> hand

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
and you can see you on the other hand

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.520 
and you can see you on the other hand
I'm<00:04:06.170> not<00:04:06.320> holding<00:04:06.890> the<00:04:06.950> camera<00:04:07.280> with<00:04:07.670> it<00:04:08.530> but

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
I'm not holding the camera with it but

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.570 
I'm not holding the camera with it but
if<00:04:09.920> you<00:04:09.980> could<00:04:10.190> see<00:04:10.370> the<00:04:11.120> paddle<00:04:12.070> hooks<00:04:13.070> under

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
if you could see the paddle hooks under

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.900 
if you could see the paddle hooks under
so<00:04:13.910> your<00:04:14.180> hand<00:04:14.420> can<00:04:14.780> kind<00:04:15.050> of<00:04:15.170> like<00:04:16.660> Egypt<00:04:17.660> the

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
so your hand can kind of like Egypt the

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:26.440 
so your hand can kind of like Egypt the
you<00:04:19.910> can<00:04:20.090> kind<00:04:20.360> of<00:04:20.450> hit<00:04:20.660> it<00:04:20.780> in<00:04:21.290> the<00:04:21.709> middle<00:04:25.450> but

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
you can kind of hit it in the middle but

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.620 
you can kind of hit it in the middle but
it's<00:04:26.720> best<00:04:26.960> to<00:04:27.110> hit<00:04:27.260> it<00:04:27.350> down<00:04:27.530> there<00:04:27.830> I<00:04:27.860> guess

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
it's best to hit it down there I guess

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.060 
it's best to hit it down there I guess
you'll<00:04:29.630> be<00:04:29.690> holding<00:04:29.990> the<00:04:30.320> controller<00:04:30.710> like
