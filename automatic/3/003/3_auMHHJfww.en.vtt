00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.560 
look to engage the children in their
learning<00:03:05.650> I<00:03:06.070> find<00:03:06.730> that<00:03:06.790> if<00:03:06.910> I<00:03:07.000> sit<00:03:07.270> and<00:03:07.420> talk

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
learning I find that if I sit and talk

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.630 
learning I find that if I sit and talk
your<00:03:07.750> children<00:03:08.170> they<00:03:08.410> don't<00:03:08.590> listen<00:03:08.830> but<00:03:09.490> when

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
your children they don't listen but when

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.010 
your children they don't listen but when
they<00:03:09.730> become<00:03:10.030> involved<00:03:10.360> in<00:03:10.660> their<00:03:10.810> learning

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
they become involved in their learning

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.780 
they become involved in their learning
they're<00:03:11.739> empowered<00:03:12.340> and<00:03:12.520> they<00:03:12.610> feel

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
they're empowered and they feel

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.080 
they're empowered and they feel
ownership<00:03:13.060> over<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:15.220> I<00:03:15.310> also<00:03:15.520> find<00:03:15.910> that

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
ownership over and I also find that

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.930 
ownership over and I also find that
using<00:03:16.560> group<00:03:17.560> work<00:03:17.800> helps<00:03:18.250> the<00:03:18.370> children<00:03:18.550> to

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
using group work helps the children to

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.479 
using group work helps the children to
become<00:03:19.209> more<00:03:19.600> independent<00:03:19.840> and<00:03:20.440> to<00:03:20.860> learn

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
become more independent and to learn
