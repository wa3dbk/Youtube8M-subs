save<00:02:56.590> a<00:02:56.709> wounded<00:02:57.269> so<00:02:58.269> I<00:02:58.510> started<00:02:59.049> thinking

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
save a wounded so I started thinking

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.929 
save a wounded so I started thinking
that<00:02:59.859> there<00:03:00.010> must<00:03:00.159> be<00:03:00.280> someone<00:03:00.669> who<00:03:00.790> takes

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:00.939 
that there must be someone who takes

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:03.639 
care of them that is when I decided that

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:06.089 
care of them that is when I decided that
I<00:03:03.939> wanted<00:03:04.389> to<00:03:04.569> be<00:03:04.689> a<00:03:04.720> veterinary<00:03:05.260> doctor<00:03:05.919> and

I wanted to be a veterinary doctor and
then<00:03:06.639> I<00:03:06.669> thought<00:03:07.120> that<00:03:07.389> why<00:03:07.599> don't<00:03:07.659> I<00:03:08.109> also

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530
