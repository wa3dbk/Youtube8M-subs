definitely<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.369> meaty<00:01:29.670> affair<00:01:30.180> which<00:01:30.420> I'll

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
definitely a meaty affair which I'll

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.450 
definitely a meaty affair which I'll
definitely<00:01:31.290> back<00:01:31.650> up<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.890> bit<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.220> information

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
definitely back up a bit of information

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.319 
definitely back up a bit of information
a<00:01:32.759> bit<00:01:32.909> later<00:01:33.119> on<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:34.159> it<00:01:35.159> definitely<00:01:35.369> was<00:01:35.700> but

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
a bit later on and it definitely was but

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.120 
a bit later on and it definitely was but
thing<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:37.110> don't<00:01:37.170> think<00:01:37.350> nany<00:01:37.650> was<00:01:37.890> playing

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
thing is I don't think nany was playing

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.399 
thing is I don't think nany was playing
very<00:01:38.400> well<00:01:38.549> not<00:01:39.150> as<00:01:39.299> well<00:01:39.450> as<00:01:39.570> he<00:01:39.689> used<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.079> some

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
very well not as well as he used to some

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.760 
very well not as well as he used to some
of<00:01:40.470> his<00:01:40.500> crosses<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:42.110> parson<00:01:43.110> ability<00:01:43.470> wasn't

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
of his crosses and parson ability wasn't

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.770 
of his crosses and parson ability wasn't
up<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:43.950> scratch<00:01:44.390> maybe<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.479> haven't<00:01:45.630> played

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
up to scratch maybe I haven't played

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.660 
up to scratch maybe I haven't played
enough<00:01:45.899> pre-seasons<00:01:46.799> I'm<00:01:47.040> not<00:01:47.430> quite<00:01:47.640> sure

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
enough pre-seasons I'm not quite sure

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.999 
enough pre-seasons I'm not quite sure
but<00:01:47.909> he<00:01:48.479> definitely<00:01:48.720> wasn't<00:01:49.020> all<00:01:49.170> there<00:01:49.439> this

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
but he definitely wasn't all there this

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.270 
but he definitely wasn't all there this
man<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.180> won't<00:01:51.390> want<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.590> bad<00:01:52.829> but<00:01:53.159> they
