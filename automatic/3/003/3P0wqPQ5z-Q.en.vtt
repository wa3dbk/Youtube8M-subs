00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.910
 later when to the top of a mountain in the depths 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.760
 dungeons there was a war of three hammers 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.620
 dark iron dwarf leader taurissan 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.840
 planning to summon the mighty 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.930
 minions appealed to the ancient forces 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.509

 an ancient creature appeared before the king 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.200

 still get this legendary 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.640
 item to get this 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.930
 legendary item required two 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.479
 main components 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.920
 Sulfur Omsk is young and the eye of sulfur wasp 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.630
 to make a hammer 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.360
 required a bunch of rare reagents 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.850
 which fell in the fiery interior including 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.030
 such as sulphur ingot and blood 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.670
 mountains of bullion fell with golem aha raid 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.250
 boss if you believe in the move that chance 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.979
 accounted for 33 percent that is not 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.150
 guaranteed every gd blood mountains gave 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.400
 destroyers from the depths 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.340
 and the chances of falling were also small 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.170
 about seven percent in times when 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.790
 rating was a lot not too many and 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.500
 walked by 40 people 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.140
 the collection of all these resources could be delayed 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.940
 for months but even if you collected 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.820
 sulfur he sky hammer then stayed 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:03.090
 the second component of the eye sulfur wasp which 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.830
 fell the final boss chances of falling 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.170
 accounted for about 4 percent 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.600
 what is the dollar associated with this weapon then 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.670
 there is a small odd thing with one 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.790
 hand everything is clear it's the hammer itself 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.520
 ragnaros firelord but on the other 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.950
 if we win then what's the point of long 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.290
 pharma resources attracting a blacksmith for 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.300
 create the subject and the hammer itself 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.460
 so big as it can 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.530
 to wield a mere mortal in part 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.260
 the answer can be found next 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.360
 passages in the history of Azeroth again sulfu 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.490
 incredible velib even if mortal 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.960
 somehow not win then hardly 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.490
 they can take it in hand 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.220
 however fanatical followers 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.800
 Ragnaros found a way to make 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.930
 hammer of the original form each requires an eye 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.060
 Sulf times and it is smaller in size 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.100
 weapons known as sulphur he skie 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.440
 young and sulphur he hammer it 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.140
 small copy of the sulph times 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.120
 This is what explains this problem with 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.610
 creating a blank with an elf 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.370

 any problems to get into 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.959
 dungeons do not need a raid group on 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.269
 Essentially the only problem here is 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:19.209
 oku sulphur wasp chance drop still 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:21.100

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.930
 if you don't clean the whole thrash then full 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.160
