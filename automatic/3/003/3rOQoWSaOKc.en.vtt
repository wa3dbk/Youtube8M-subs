in this video I'm going to show you
perhaps<00:00:02.740> the<00:00:03.399> world's<00:00:03.790> simplest<00:00:04.060> for<00:00:04.750> egami

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:05.020 
perhaps the world's simplest for egami

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.560 
perhaps the world's simplest for egami
envelope<00:00:05.530> that<00:00:05.680> you<00:00:05.830> can<00:00:06.010> fold<00:00:06.190> and<00:00:06.580> the<00:00:07.420> nice

thing<00:00:07.600> about<00:00:07.810> this<00:00:08.200> particular<00:00:08.999> process<00:00:09.999> is

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:10.240 
thing about this particular process is

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.020 
thing about this particular process is
that<00:00:10.629> with<00:00:11.019> a<00:00:11.259> standard<00:00:11.709> sized<00:00:11.980> piece<00:00:12.490> of<00:00:12.730> six

origami paper or that's 15 centimeters
by<00:00:17.860> 15<00:00:18.220> centimeters<00:00:18.540> you<00:00:19.540> can<00:00:19.720> make<00:00:19.900> yourself

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.050 
by 15 centimeters you can make yourself

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.820 
by 15 centimeters you can make yourself
a<00:00:20.620> really<00:00:21.250> nice<00:00:21.520> gift<00:00:22.120> card<00:00:22.390> envelope<00:00:22.560> so<00:00:23.560> that

a really nice gift card envelope so that

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.070 
a really nice gift card envelope so that
you<00:00:24.310> can<00:00:24.520> take<00:00:24.730> what<00:00:25.120> is<00:00:25.330> sometimes<00:00:25.780> an

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.080 
you can take what is sometimes an

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.860 
you can take what is sometimes an
impersonal<00:00:26.890> gift<00:00:27.130> and<00:00:27.450> personalize<00:00:28.450> it<00:00:28.660> so

that it looks a little extra special now

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.209 
that it looks a little extra special now
this<00:00:31.780> process<00:00:32.020> can<00:00:32.259> be<00:00:32.469> used<00:00:32.589> to<00:00:32.920> make<00:00:33.070> an

00:00:33.209 --> 00:00:33.219 
this process can be used to make an

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:34.680 
this process can be used to make an
envelope<00:00:33.550> for<00:00:33.760> just<00:00:33.910> about<00:00:34.030> anything

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
envelope for just about anything

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.439 
envelope for just about anything
flat<00:00:35.199> out<00:00:35.499> of<00:00:35.920> just<00:00:36.370> about<00:00:36.579> any<00:00:36.910> sized<00:00:37.179> piece

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:37.449 
flat out of just about any sized piece

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:39.810 
flat out of just about any sized piece
of<00:00:37.600> paper<00:00:37.769> and<00:00:38.769> I'll<00:00:39.280> show<00:00:39.429> you<00:00:39.550> the<00:00:39.640> process

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
of paper and I'll show you the process

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.989 
of paper and I'll show you the process
for<00:00:40.149> a<00:00:40.749> gift<00:00:41.109> card<00:00:41.289> envelope<00:00:41.440> and<00:00:41.980> you<00:00:42.760> can

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:42.999 
for a gift card envelope and you can

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:46.079 
for a gift card envelope and you can
then<00:00:43.269> use<00:00:43.300> that<00:00:43.539> process<00:00:43.960> to<00:00:44.460> make<00:00:45.460> it<00:00:45.760> for

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:46.089 
then use that process to make it for

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:49.770 
then use that process to make it for
just<00:00:46.269> about<00:00:46.510> anything<00:00:47.079> you<00:00:47.260> want<00:00:48.179> so<00:00:49.179> what<00:00:49.690> you

either side go ahead take this out and

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.730 
either side go ahead take this out and
then<00:01:17.530> use<00:01:17.920> this<00:01:18.610> edge<00:01:19.000> and<00:01:19.299> this<00:01:19.539> edge<00:01:19.810> to<00:01:20.619> make

then use this edge and this edge to make

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:28.039 
then use this edge and this edge to make
these<00:01:20.979> creases<00:01:22.110> as<00:01:23.110> straight<00:01:23.530> as<00:01:23.619> possible

like<00:01:29.049> that<00:01:29.289> and<00:01:29.710> that<00:01:30.100> will<00:01:30.250> form<00:01:30.579> the<00:01:31.079> pocket

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:32.079 
like that and that will form the pocket

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:35.609 
like that and that will form the pocket
that<00:01:32.289> we<00:01:32.409> will<00:01:32.590> put<00:01:32.859> our<00:01:33.850> gift<00:01:34.509> card<00:01:34.750> in<00:01:34.899> and

through the middle of the card if that's

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.340 
through the middle of the card if that's
where<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.150> want<00:02:00.330> the<00:02:00.420> band<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.900> can<00:02:01.050> have<00:02:01.200> the

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
go ahead and fold this down over it like

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.380 
go ahead and fold this down over it like
that<00:02:11.060> what<00:02:12.060> you're<00:02:12.180> gonna<00:02:12.270> do<00:02:12.450> is<00:02:12.600> unfold<00:02:14.390> all

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
of that turn it over and on this crease

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.110 
of that turn it over and on this crease
here<00:02:20.460> that<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:20.760> made<00:02:22.010> go<00:02:23.010> ahead<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:23.700> use<00:02:24.090> that

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
here that you made go ahead and use that

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.570
