this is one of the simplest songs out
there<00:00:49.340> from<00:00:49.790> a<00:00:49.940> chord<00:00:50.180> progression<00:00:50.210> point<00:00:50.750> of

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
there from a chord progression point of

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.770 
there from a chord progression point of
view<00:00:51.020> but<00:00:51.740> it<00:00:51.950> is<00:00:52.070> really<00:00:52.460> fun<00:00:52.730> to<00:00:52.940> just<00:00:53.240> play

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780

best way to play the rhythm guitar part

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.270 
best way to play the rhythm guitar part
isn't<00:01:08.060> a<00:01:08.270> double<00:01:08.540> drop<00:01:08.750> D<00:01:08.990> tuning<00:01:09.050> but<00:01:10.010> you<00:01:10.160> can

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
isn't a double drop D tuning but you can

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.580 
isn't a double drop D tuning but you can
also<00:01:10.400> play<00:01:10.670> it<00:01:10.850> in<00:01:11.030> drop<00:01:11.300> D<00:01:11.330> or<00:01:11.810> in<00:01:12.050> standard

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
also play it in drop D or in standard

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.470 
also play it in drop D or in standard
and<00:01:12.800> still<00:01:13.280> get<00:01:13.490> kind<00:01:13.670> of<00:01:13.820> the<00:01:13.940> same<00:01:14.120> effect

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:14.480 
and still get kind of the same effect

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.500 
and still get kind of the same effect

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
the best tuning views probably if you're

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.670 
the best tuning views probably if you're
just<00:01:17.630> going<00:01:17.750> to<00:01:17.810> play<00:01:17.960> lead<00:01:18.200> to<00:01:18.410> it<00:01:18.560> is

standard tuning because what we're going
to<00:01:20.119> talk<00:01:20.240> about<00:01:20.390> in<00:01:20.600> this<00:01:20.690> lesson<00:01:20.900> is<00:01:21.700> using

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
to talk about in this lesson is using

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.660 
to talk about in this lesson is using
the<00:01:22.970> pentatonic<00:01:23.330> scale<00:01:23.750> and<00:01:24.130> adding<00:01:25.130> in<00:01:25.310> the

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
the pentatonic scale and adding in the

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.450 
the pentatonic scale and adding in the
couple<00:01:26.060> of<00:01:26.180> missing<00:01:26.660> notes<00:01:27.010> when<00:01:28.010> it<00:01:28.160> seems

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
couple of missing notes when it seems

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.370 
couple of missing notes when it seems
like<00:01:28.670> a<00:01:28.700> good<00:01:28.910> time<00:01:29.210> the<00:01:29.390> song<00:01:29.630> is<00:01:29.780> a<00:01:29.810> perfect

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
like a good time the song is a perfect

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.620 
like a good time the song is a perfect
example<00:01:30.800> for<00:01:31.340> that<00:01:31.460> because<00:01:31.670> for<00:01:32.420> couple

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
example for that because for couple

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.170 
example for that because for couple
reasons<00:01:32.900> but<00:01:32.990> the<00:01:33.110> biggest<00:01:33.290> one<00:01:33.410> is<00:01:34.150> two<00:01:35.150> of

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
reasons but the biggest one is two of

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.260 
reasons but the biggest one is two of
the<00:01:35.300> three<00:01:35.570> chords<00:01:36.160> include<00:01:37.160> one<00:01:37.670> of<00:01:37.700> the

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
the three chords include one of the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.330 
the three chords include one of the
missing<00:01:38.660> notes<00:01:38.810> in<00:01:39.050> the<00:01:39.110> pentatonic<00:01:39.470> scale<00:01:39.860> so

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
missing notes in the pentatonic scale so

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.680 
missing notes in the pentatonic scale so
that's<00:01:40.430> a<00:01:40.580> great<00:01:40.700> time<00:01:40.940> to<00:01:40.970> work<00:01:41.210> that<00:01:41.420> note

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
that's a great time to work that note

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.310 
that's a great time to work that note
back<00:01:42.020> in<00:01:42.350> to<00:01:43.160> your<00:01:43.490> solo<00:01:43.729> and<00:01:44.090> the<00:01:44.990> other<00:01:45.110> is

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
back in to your solo and the other is

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.030 
back in to your solo and the other is
the<00:01:45.650> chords<00:01:45.979> change<00:01:46.430> very<00:01:47.180> slowly<00:01:47.930> so<00:01:48.680> it<00:01:48.710> is<00:01:49.009> a

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
the chords change very slowly so it is a

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.389 
the chords change very slowly so it is a
real<00:01:49.490> simple<00:01:49.820> strumming<00:01:50.420> song<00:01:50.740> that<00:01:51.740> is<00:01:52.009> just

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
real simple strumming song that is just

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.600 
real simple strumming song that is just
a<00:01:52.640> blast<00:01:53.420> to<00:01:53.960> play<00:01:53.990> along<00:01:54.350> with<00:01:54.380> three<00:01:55.369> chords

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
a blast to play along with three chords

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.840 
a blast to play along with three chords
really<00:01:55.970> a<00:01:56.360> minor<00:01:56.660> 7<00:01:57.110> D<00:01:57.530> and<00:01:57.890> a<00:01:58.070> minor<00:01:58.280> 7

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
really a minor 7 D and a minor 7

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.040 
really a minor 7 D and a minor 7
but<00:01:59.360> the<00:02:00.190> tuning<00:02:01.190> the<00:02:01.460> double<00:02:01.729> drop<00:02:01.880> D<00:02:02.119> or<00:02:02.390> even

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
but the tuning the double drop D or even

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.620 
but the tuning the double drop D or even
single<00:02:03.410> drop<00:02:03.590> d<00:02:03.800> will<00:02:04.340> change<00:02:04.640> some<00:02:05.479> of<00:02:05.509> the

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
single drop d will change some of the

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:06.999 
single drop d will change some of the
fingerings<00:02:05.990> that<00:02:06.080> you<00:02:06.200> want<00:02:06.350> to<00:02:06.410> use<00:02:06.500> for<00:02:06.679> so

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
fingerings that you want to use for so

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.219 
fingerings that you want to use for so
we'll<00:02:07.280> talk<00:02:07.369> about<00:02:07.550> those<00:02:07.729> first<00:02:08.149> in<00:02:08.450> in<00:02:09.080> the

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
we'll talk about those first in in the

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.510 
we'll talk about those first in in the
next<00:02:09.590> segment<00:02:09.979> talk<00:02:10.100> about<00:02:10.250> different<00:02:10.490> ways

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
next segment talk about different ways

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.700 
next segment talk about different ways
of<00:02:10.729> playing<00:02:10.880> the<00:02:10.970> chords<00:02:11.300> but<00:02:11.720> you<00:02:12.440> have<00:02:12.590> those

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
of playing the chords but you have those

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.370 
of playing the chords but you have those
three<00:02:12.920> chords<00:02:13.160> e<00:02:13.370> minor<00:02:13.610> seven<00:02:14.030> D<00:02:14.510> a<00:02:14.870> lot<00:02:15.140> of

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
three chords e minor seven D a lot of

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.960 
three chords e minor seven D a lot of
times<00:02:15.530> you<00:02:15.620> play<00:02:15.770> the<00:02:15.890> D<00:02:16.040> as<00:02:16.160> a<00:02:16.190> suspended<00:02:16.760> two

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
times you play the D as a suspended two

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.280 
times you play the D as a suspended two
you<00:02:17.210> wouldn't<00:02:17.450> necessarily<00:02:17.540> want<00:02:17.930> to<00:02:18.050> hear

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
you wouldn't necessarily want to hear

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.680 
you wouldn't necessarily want to hear
the<00:02:18.500> f-sharp<00:02:18.620> in<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.190> chord<00:02:19.520> but<00:02:20.210> we<00:02:20.300> do<00:02:20.450> want

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
the f-sharp in the chord but we do want

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.180 
the f-sharp in the chord but we do want
to<00:02:20.720> use<00:02:20.780> that<00:02:20.990> sharp<00:02:21.290> in<00:02:21.380> the<00:02:21.440> solo<00:02:21.740> some<00:02:21.980> times

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
to use that sharp in the solo some times

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.330 
to use that sharp in the solo some times
and<00:02:22.580> and<00:02:23.569> then<00:02:23.780> a<00:02:23.960> minor<00:02:24.170> seven<00:02:24.530> so<00:02:24.890> kind<00:02:25.280> of

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
and and then a minor seven so kind of

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.250 
and and then a minor seven so kind of
standard<00:02:25.730> ways<00:02:26.270> of<00:02:26.450> fingering<00:02:26.720> those<00:02:26.900> chords

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
standard ways of fingering those chords

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.750 
standard ways of fingering those chords
we'll<00:02:27.740> get<00:02:27.830> into<00:02:27.950> those<00:02:28.069> first<00:02:28.430> and<00:02:28.640> then

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
we'll get into those first and then

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.070 
we'll get into those first and then
we'll<00:02:28.850> talk<00:02:29.030> about<00:02:29.180> some<00:02:29.630> of<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.780> things<00:02:29.959> you

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
we'll talk about some of the things you

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.110 
we'll talk about some of the things you
