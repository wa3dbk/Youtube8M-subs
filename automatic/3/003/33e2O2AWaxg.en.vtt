and<00:02:27.300> still<00:02:27.720> I<00:02:28.050> don't<00:02:28.530> like<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:28.800> decorate<00:02:29.130> it

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
and still I don't like to decorate it

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.830 
and still I don't like to decorate it
like<00:02:29.310> this<00:02:29.519> I<00:02:29.730> like<00:02:29.880> to<00:02:29.940> hold<00:02:30.209> it<00:02:30.450> just<00:02:30.690> like

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
like this I like to hold it just like

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.610 
like this I like to hold it just like
this<00:02:31.140> this<00:02:31.410> is<00:02:31.590> how<00:02:31.739> I<00:02:31.769> like<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:31.980> hold<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.569> again

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
this this is how I like to hold it again

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.520 
this this is how I like to hold it again
so<00:02:34.620> this<00:02:34.830> is<00:02:35.010> reverse<00:02:35.370> shell<00:02:35.640> circle<00:02:36.380> see<00:02:37.380> it's

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
so this is reverse shell circle see it's

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.650 
so this is reverse shell circle see it's
like<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.800> infinity<00:02:38.430> symbol<00:02:38.670> or<00:02:39.150> like<00:02:39.480> the

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
like the infinity symbol or like the

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.850 
like the infinity symbol or like the
figure<00:02:40.049> 8<00:02:41.090> this<00:02:42.090> way

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
figure 8 this way

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.330 
figure 8 this way
swirl<00:02:43.860> swirl<00:02:45.290> this<00:02:46.290> is<00:02:46.440> how<00:02:46.590> you<00:02:46.650> do<00:02:46.890> it<00:02:47.010> really

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
swirl swirl this is how you do it really

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:55.130 
swirl swirl this is how you do it really
slow<00:02:47.880> and<00:02:48.090> turn<00:02:48.360> it<00:02:48.600> turn<00:02:49.470> it<00:02:51.739> now<00:02:54.049> when<00:02:55.049> you

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
slow and turn it turn it now when you

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.979 
slow and turn it turn it now when you
get<00:02:55.290> fast<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:55.980> can<00:02:56.130> just<00:02:56.370> go<00:02:56.700> like<00:02:57.480> this<00:02:58.130> see

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
get fast you can just go like this see

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.220 
get fast you can just go like this see
let's<00:03:00.989> call<00:03:01.260> it<00:03:01.380> a<00:03:01.410> reverse<00:03:01.680> shell

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.960 

now<00:03:04.800> you<00:03:05.040> want<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:05.280> practice<00:03:05.489> on<00:03:05.790> your

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
now you want to practice on your

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:14.090 
now you want to practice on your
rosebuds<00:03:06.920> you<00:03:07.920> can<00:03:08.129> just<00:03:08.340> practice<00:03:08.730> like<00:03:09.180> this

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.100

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
can practice like I said before again

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.860 
can practice like I said before again
and<00:03:24.660> again<00:03:25.140> and<00:03:25.440> again<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:26.550> that<00:03:27.030> way<00:03:27.210> we

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
and again and again and that way we

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.320 
and again and again and that way we
don't<00:03:27.990> have<00:03:28.080> to<00:03:28.200> buy<00:03:28.470> a<00:03:28.500> whole<00:03:28.710> bunch<00:03:28.890> of<00:03:29.040> tools

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330
