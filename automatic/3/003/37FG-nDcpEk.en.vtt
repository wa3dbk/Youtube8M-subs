next in our series of exercises we want

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.420 
next in our series of exercises we want
to<00:00:02.100> do<00:00:02.190> for<00:00:02.460> our<00:00:03.080> speed<00:00:04.080> strength<00:00:04.410> and<00:00:04.710> power

first one we're going to do is a squat
jump<00:00:12.950> here<00:00:13.950> nothing<00:00:14.340> more<00:00:14.490> than<00:00:14.670> we're

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
jump here nothing more than we're

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.599 
jump here nothing more than we're
looking<00:00:15.210> for<00:00:15.360> good<00:00:15.480> squat<00:00:15.870> technique<00:00:16.609> gonna

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
looking for good squat technique gonna

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.340 
looking for good squat technique gonna
have<00:00:17.760> that<00:00:17.910> low<00:00:18.060> position<00:00:18.330> but<00:00:18.960> you<00:00:19.050> can<00:00:19.170> see

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
have that low position but you can see

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.630 
have that low position but you can see
Brian's<00:00:19.710> kind<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:19.980> got<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.100> little<00:00:20.279> bit<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.580> that

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
Brian's kind of got a little bit of that

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.519 
Brian's kind of got a little bit of that
angle<00:00:21.119> forward<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.539> that's<00:00:21.689> fine<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.439> he's

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
angle forward and that's fine and he's

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.560 
angle forward and that's fine and he's
just<00:00:22.619> gonna<00:00:22.769> jump<00:00:23.130> as<00:00:23.730> high<00:00:23.970> as<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.180> can<00:00:24.359> and

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
just gonna jump as high as you can and

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.330 
just gonna jump as high as you can and
then<00:00:24.720> land<00:00:24.990> in<00:00:25.109> that<00:00:25.260> position<00:00:25.439> again<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.189> see

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
then land in that position again you see

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.220 
then land in that position again you see
he's<00:00:26.430> kind<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.699> landing<00:00:27.060> like<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.240> spring<00:00:27.750> he's

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
he's kind of landing like a spring he's

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.650 
he's kind of landing like a spring he's
laying<00:00:28.470> with<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.710> knees<00:00:28.920> bent<00:00:29.539> letting<00:00:30.539> all

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
laying with the knees bent letting all

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.359 
laying with the knees bent letting all
the<00:00:30.840> force<00:00:31.199> be<00:00:31.380> absorbed<00:00:31.769> through<00:00:31.830> his<00:00:32.070> quads

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
the force be absorbed through his quads

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.139 
the force be absorbed through his quads
go<00:00:32.669> ahead<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:32.940> do<00:00:33.059> two<00:00:33.420> or<00:00:33.510> three<00:00:33.570> jumps<00:00:35.870> good

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
go ahead and do two or three jumps good

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:40.880 
go ahead and do two or three jumps good
again<00:00:39.149> right<00:00:39.960> here<00:00:40.140> he's<00:00:40.230> going<00:00:40.379> for<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.620> number

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
again right here he's going for a number

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.830 
again right here he's going for a number
of<00:00:40.980> repetitions<00:00:41.730> we're<00:00:42.149> looking<00:00:42.480> anywhere

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
of repetitions we're looking anywhere

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.260 
of repetitions we're looking anywhere
probably<00:00:43.649> in<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:44.309> lower<00:00:44.489> extremities<00:00:45.120> we're

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
probably in the lower extremities we're

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.880 
probably in the lower extremities we're
looking<00:00:45.510> somewhere<00:00:45.809> rep<00:00:46.110> range<00:00:46.379> about<00:00:46.590> six

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
looking somewhere rep range about six

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.760 
looking somewhere rep range about six
eight<00:00:47.570> these<00:00:48.570> can<00:00:48.750> be<00:00:48.870> accomplished<00:00:49.320> two<00:00:49.530> ways

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
eight these can be accomplished two ways

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.670 
eight these can be accomplished two ways
one<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.910> can<00:00:51.090> do<00:00:51.210> them<00:00:51.360> multiple<00:00:52.289> spring

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
one you can do them multiple spring

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.950 
one you can do them multiple spring
style<00:00:53.100> or<00:00:53.430> we<00:00:53.579> can<00:00:53.730> do<00:00:53.850> one<00:00:54.059> at<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.270> time<00:00:54.539> again

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
style or we can do one at a time again

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.479 
style or we can do one at a time again
as<00:00:55.079> we<00:00:55.199> get<00:00:55.289> closer<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.770> taper<00:00:56.070> we're<00:00:56.309> going<00:00:56.430> to

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
as we get closer to taper we're going to

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.720 
as we get closer to taper we're going to
concentrate<00:00:56.730> more<00:00:57.239> on<00:00:57.300> explosive<00:00:58.520> one<00:00:59.520> at<00:00:59.670> a

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
concentrate more on explosive one at a

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.910 
concentrate more on explosive one at a
time<00:00:59.969> type<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.390> movements<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.989> as<00:01:01.559> we're<00:01:01.739> as

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
time type of movements and as we're as

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.889 
time type of movements and as we're as
we're<00:01:02.129> developing<00:01:02.579> into<00:01:02.850> our<00:01:02.940> taper<00:01:03.510> and

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
we're developing into our taper and

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.960 
we're developing into our taper and
prior<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.650> our<00:01:04.769> power<00:01:05.010> stuff<00:01:05.430> we<00:01:05.820> may

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
prior to that and our power stuff we may

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.910 
prior to that and our power stuff we may
add<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.150> med<00:01:06.450> ball<00:01:06.659> having<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.260> med<00:01:07.470> ball<00:01:07.680> right

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
add a med ball having the med ball right

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.440 
add a med ball having the med ball right
here<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.400> doing<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.820> series<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.360> jumps<00:01:11.450> that's

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
here and doing a series of jumps that's

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.410 
here and doing a series of jumps that's
good<00:01:12.890> and<00:01:13.890> if<00:01:14.310> we<00:01:14.400> wanted<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.700> be<00:01:14.820> specific

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
good and if we wanted to be specific

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:23.149 
good and if we wanted to be specific
we'd<00:01:15.780> have<00:01:15.960> them<00:01:16.049> streamline<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:20.869> good<00:01:22.159> any

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
we'd have them streamline it good any

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.060 
we'd have them streamline it good any
time<00:01:23.369> during<00:01:23.549> these<00:01:23.729> movements<00:01:24.500> to<00:01:25.500> get<00:01:26.040> a

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
time during these movements to get a

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.249 
time during these movements to get a
reaction<00:01:26.790> in<00:01:26.939> there<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.299> do<00:01:27.689> something<00:01:27.960> that

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
reaction in there to do something that

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.870 
reaction in there to do something that
would<00:01:28.409> probably<00:01:28.619> mimic<00:01:29.159> something<00:01:29.369> off<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.759> a

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
would probably mimic something off of a

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.520 
would probably mimic something off of a
block<00:01:30.180> or<00:01:30.509> trying<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.840> get<00:01:30.990> something<00:01:31.409> that

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
block or trying to get something that

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.280 
block or trying to get something that
would<00:01:31.619> be<00:01:31.820> explosive<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.000> into<00:01:33.450> either<00:01:33.900> audio

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
would be explosive and into either audio

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.920 
would be explosive and into either audio
visual<00:01:35.009> cue<00:01:35.280> mad<00:01:35.880> they<00:01:36.060> athlete<00:01:36.420> go<00:01:36.570> down<00:01:36.720> and

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
visual cue mad they athlete go down and

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.210 
visual cue mad they athlete go down and
hold<00:01:37.140> hold<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.979> squat<00:01:38.280> position<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:40.070> I<00:01:41.070> would

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
hold hold the squat position and I would

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.719 
hold hold the squat position and I would
just<00:01:41.340> give<00:01:41.460> him<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.640> cue<00:01:41.880> up<00:01:42.799> again<00:01:43.799> be<00:01:44.399> ready<00:01:44.579> to

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
just give him a cue up again be ready to

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.639 
just give him a cue up again be ready to
go<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:45.390> make<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.659> more<00:01:45.840> specific

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
go to make it more specific

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.429 
go to make it more specific
I<00:01:46.680> may<00:01:46.979> have<00:01:47.100> Brian<00:01:47.399> go<00:01:47.759> down<00:01:47.970> into<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.960> track

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
I may have Brian go down into a track

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.510 
I may have Brian go down into a track
start<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:51.049> as<00:01:52.049> he's<00:01:52.320> gonna<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.860> tell<00:01:53.340> him<00:01:53.460> to

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
start and as he's gonna I tell him to

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.280 
start and as he's gonna I tell him to
take<00:01:53.670> his<00:01:53.820> mark<00:01:54.060> or<00:01:54.240> whatever<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.810> he<00:01:55.170> would

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
take his mark or whatever and he would

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.560 
take his mark or whatever and he would
actually<00:01:55.799> jump<00:01:56.070> into<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.369> streamline<00:01:56.850> as<00:01:57.060> you

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
actually jump into a streamline as you

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.420 
actually jump into a streamline as you
would<00:01:57.689> enter<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.049> water<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:58.649> take<00:01:59.070> your<00:01:59.159> mark

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
would enter the water so take your mark

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.550 
would enter the water so take your mark
but<00:02:01.219> again<00:02:02.299> nothing<00:02:03.299> more<00:02:03.659> than<00:02:04.020> adding<00:02:04.469> a

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
but again nothing more than adding a

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.990 
but again nothing more than adding a
simple<00:02:04.770> movement<00:02:05.250> here<00:02:05.430> can<00:02:05.610> make<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:05.850> that

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
simple movement here can make it that

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.150 
simple movement here can make it that
much<00:02:06.030> more<00:02:06.420> specific<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:07.079> add<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.860> element

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
much more specific and add the element

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.970 
much more specific and add the element
of<00:02:08.190> reaction<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.819> it
