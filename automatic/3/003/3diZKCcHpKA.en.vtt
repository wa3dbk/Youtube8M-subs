00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
hey guys just a quick walkthrough of the

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.610 
hey guys just a quick walkthrough of the
hideout<00:00:02.669> i<00:00:02.879> recently<00:00:03.330> got<00:00:03.510> eleven<00:00:03.959> thousand

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
hideout i recently got eleven thousand

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.190 
hideout i recently got eleven thousand
points<00:00:04.740> on<00:00:04.980> this<00:00:05.130> so<00:00:05.819> here's<00:00:06.359> my<00:00:06.660> take<00:00:06.960> on<00:00:07.140> it

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
points on this so here's my take on it

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.960 
points on this so here's my take on it
so<00:00:07.770> when<00:00:08.069> you<00:00:08.160> start<00:00:08.340> off<00:00:08.460> you<00:00:08.639> want<00:00:08.730> to<00:00:08.790> slide

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
so when you start off you want to slide

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.480 
so when you start off you want to slide
down<00:00:09.000> here<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:09.410> basically<00:00:10.410> stump<00:00:10.950> these<00:00:11.160> guys

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
down here and basically stump these guys

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.129 
down here and basically stump these guys
into<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.849> ceiling<00:00:12.090> pretty<00:00:12.389> standard<00:00:12.840> you'll

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
into the ceiling pretty standard you'll

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.400 
into the ceiling pretty standard you'll
get<00:00:13.349> nice<00:00:14.190> water<00:00:14.490> three<00:00:15.480> times<00:00:15.540> over<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.230> it's

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
get nice water three times over and it's

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.019
