wrong with it because it's a new wig and

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.910 
wrong with it because it's a new wig and
it's<00:00:44.760> priced<00:00:45.059> was<00:00:45.329> almost<00:00:45.690> 70<00:00:46.170> bucks<00:00:46.410> then<00:00:46.890> I

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
it's priced was almost 70 bucks then I

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.000 
it's priced was almost 70 bucks then I
was<00:00:47.340> on<00:00:47.460> clearance<00:00:47.730> for<00:00:48.030> like<00:00:48.719> 25<00:00:49.260> or<00:00:49.320> 30<00:00:49.860> years

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
was on clearance for like 25 or 30 years

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.790 
was on clearance for like 25 or 30 years
a<00:00:50.309> lot<00:00:50.520> less<00:00:50.850> significantly<00:00:51.690> less<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.710> I'm

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
a lot less significantly less so I'm

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.619 
a lot less significantly less so I'm
thinking<00:00:53.160> okay<00:00:53.340> obviously<00:00:54.030> it's<00:00:54.180> not<00:00:54.239> worth

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
thinking okay obviously it's not worth

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.840 
thinking okay obviously it's not worth
70<00:00:55.020> diamond<00:00:55.469> must<00:00:55.980> be<00:00:56.100> wrong<00:00:56.370> with<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.579> wig

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
70 diamond must be wrong with the wig

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.880 
70 diamond must be wrong with the wig
that<00:00:57.570> would<00:00:57.690> make<00:00:57.840> somebody<00:00:58.230> not<00:00:58.410> wanna<00:00:58.680> pay

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
that would make somebody not wanna pay

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.580 
that would make somebody not wanna pay
70<00:00:59.219> bucks<00:00:59.430> worth<00:00:59.640> true<00:01:00.120> not<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.780> semi<00:01:01.170> die<00:01:01.289> way

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.100 
70 bucks worth true not a semi die way
but<00:01:02.129> for<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.370> price<00:01:02.579> it's<00:01:02.940> pretty<00:01:03.390> good<00:01:03.600> now

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
but for the price it's pretty good now

classic ii but it's not as bad it's not

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.080 
classic ii but it's not as bad it's not
as<00:01:11.220> shiny<00:01:12.140> which<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.290> good<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.890> um<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.880> doesn't

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
as shiny which is good and um it doesn't

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.350 
as shiny which is good and um it doesn't
like<00:01:16.080> get<00:01:16.860> staticky<00:01:17.430> everywhere<00:01:17.850> like<00:01:18.060> other

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
like get staticky everywhere like other

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.990 
like get staticky everywhere like other
wigs<00:01:18.720> made<00:01:19.049> from<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.380> material<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.189> although

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
wigs made from that material so although

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.210 
wigs made from that material so although
this<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.420> not<00:01:21.450> my<00:01:21.750> first<00:01:22.020> choice<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.710> hair

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
this is not my first choice of hair

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.190 
this is not my first choice of hair
material<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.119> much<00:01:24.600> better<00:01:24.869> than<00:01:24.960> the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
material it is much better than the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.679 
material it is much better than the
other<00:01:25.320> ones<00:01:25.470> with<00:01:25.770> similar<00:01:26.159> material<00:01:26.689> so

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
other ones with similar material so

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.569 
other ones with similar material so
that's<00:01:27.869> one<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.320> cons<00:01:28.560> one<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.369> pros

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
that's one of the cons one of the pros

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.429 
that's one of the cons one of the pros
is<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.000> styled<00:01:30.390> well<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.869> party<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.229> pretty

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
is it styled well the party is pretty

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.109 
is it styled well the party is pretty
good<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:32.040> length<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.430> more<00:01:32.640> manageable<00:01:33.090> than

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
good the length is more manageable than

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.399 
good the length is more manageable than
the<00:01:33.329> one<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.600> I'm<00:01:33.689> comparing<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.259> the

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
the one that I'm comparing it to the

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.260 
the one that I'm comparing it to the
shed<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.490> that's<00:01:35.700> probably<00:01:35.909> one<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.150> the

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
shed so that's probably one of the

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.670 
shed so that's probably one of the
reasons<00:01:36.299> whether<00:01:36.630> knock<00:01:36.869> down<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.200> price<00:01:37.229> is

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
reasons whether knock down the price is

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.130 
reasons whether knock down the price is
the<00:01:37.920> shedding<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.689> probably<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:39.930> know<00:01:39.960> the

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
the shedding and probably you know the

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.020 
the shedding and probably you know the
texture<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.770> hair<00:01:40.799> it's<00:01:41.729> got<00:01:41.880> those

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030

because<00:03:19.650> I<00:03:19.829> have<00:03:20.040> a<00:03:20.070> lot<00:03:20.280> of<00:03:20.310> hair<00:03:20.640> so<00:03:21.030> if<00:03:21.600> you

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
because I have a lot of hair so if you

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.840 
because I have a lot of hair so if you
like<00:03:21.930> my<00:03:22.140> hair<00:03:22.350> is<00:03:22.440> about<00:03:22.650> almost<00:03:23.370> exactly

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
like my hair is about almost exactly

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.509 
like my hair is about almost exactly
this<00:03:24.060> length<00:03:24.360> so<00:03:24.870> if<00:03:25.140> you<00:03:25.350> have<00:03:25.680> short<00:03:26.040> hair

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
this length so if you have short hair

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.039 
this length so if you have short hair
you<00:03:26.730> might<00:03:26.880> not<00:03:27.150> have<00:03:27.299> that<00:03:27.450> problem<00:03:27.750> and<00:03:28.019> I

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
you might not have that problem and I

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.100 
you might not have that problem and I
think<00:03:28.079> it's<00:03:28.410> different<00:03:28.680> for<00:03:28.799> everybody<00:03:29.040> um<00:03:30.110> so

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
think it's different for everybody um so

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.630 
think it's different for everybody um so
if<00:03:31.170> you<00:03:31.230> can<00:03:31.380> see<00:03:31.500> some<00:03:31.680> tracks<00:03:31.920> just<00:03:32.310> do<00:03:32.549> what

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
if you can see some tracks just do what

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.000 
if you can see some tracks just do what
I<00:03:32.700> do<00:03:32.760> and<00:03:33.150> where<00:03:33.810> dark<00:03:34.680> color<00:03:35.070> or<00:03:35.370> color

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
I do and where dark color or color

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.500 
I do and where dark color or color
stocking<00:03:38.010> cap<00:03:38.160> underneath<00:03:38.609> that<00:03:38.910> is<00:03:39.180> similar

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
stocking cap underneath that is similar

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.900 
stocking cap underneath that is similar
to<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:39.900> color<00:03:40.170> of<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.410> hair<00:03:40.620> so<00:03:40.950> for<00:03:41.700> this<00:03:41.790> one

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
to the color of the hair so for this one

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.759 
to the color of the hair so for this one
I<00:03:41.970> didn't<00:03:42.269> wear<00:03:42.480> a<00:03:42.600> flesh-tone<00:03:43.170> stocking<00:03:43.620> cap

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
I didn't wear a flesh-tone stocking cap

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.949 
I didn't wear a flesh-tone stocking cap
which<00:03:43.950> might<00:03:44.130> help<00:03:44.340> with<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:44.910> party<00:03:45.269> but<00:03:45.840> I'd

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
which might help with the party but I'd

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.590 
which might help with the party but I'd
rather<00:03:46.140> have<00:03:46.620> my<00:03:47.130> traps<00:03:47.970> be<00:03:48.180> less<00:03:48.390> noticeable

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
rather have my traps be less noticeable

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.720 
rather have my traps be less noticeable
or<00:03:49.079> not<00:03:49.320> noticeable<00:03:49.709> at<00:03:49.799> all<00:03:49.980> versus<00:03:50.549> having

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
or not noticeable at all versus having

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.130 
or not noticeable at all versus having
