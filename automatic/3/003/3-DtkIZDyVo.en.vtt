 pumpkin porridge stress so for this 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.550
 we will need the pumpkin itself somewhere 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.680
 half a kilo 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:20.930
 thunder 800 divide it for good luck and 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.930
 peel and seed 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:34.590
 but so neatly clean further pumpkin 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.370
 cut into smaller pieces so that she 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:43.920
 boiled well 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:48.739
 too small as rashit not necessary but the circle 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:01:02.160
 legs are also not needed somewhere on such 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:01:03.920
 medium pieces so more fill our 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.570
 pumpkin 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.790
 by water 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:14.920
 so that the pumpkin is covered completely 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.920
 set on fire bring to a boil 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:35.850

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:38.450

 pumpkin ready 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.710
 strain and through colander 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.640

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.640

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:24.810

 and add these then half a glass of rice 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:45.069
 but I add sugar to taste 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:47.329
 here since we have a sweet tooth family 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:51.909

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:51.909
 spoons of sugar 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:06.109
