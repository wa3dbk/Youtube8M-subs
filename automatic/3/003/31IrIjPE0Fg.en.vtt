00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 Hello youtube and welcome to 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.319
 next video about the new apple ipad 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.110
 mini I have the thing now a few 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.670
 hours here again and again 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.130
 I play around with it between the videos 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.949
 and test and do and do and try 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.170
 just to give me my opinion about it 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.210
 and of course it is still the 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.369
 main question for me also personally it 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.970
 No retina displays has the same 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.250
 resolution as the ipad 2 or origin 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.219
 ipad it comes to the same 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:36.780
 Pixie density like an iphone 3g and iphone 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:39.750
 iphone 3gs and get rich or is one 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.390
 as someone once say the other way 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.399
 someone not retina devices wonderful 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.440
 Comes with the class pleased 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.620
 sharply barca and all the dancing in 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:53.100
 circle is someone already iphone 4 ps or 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:57.059
 5s usual ipad 3 as well as this or 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.640
 even four , we'll just take things easy 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.050
 Let's explain what you guys through and through 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.030
 I expected namely war many 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.530
 inquire from people who are still in 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.060
 you want to buy the store 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.729
 should not then i just say hey 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.590
 If you are already in the store I go 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:14.939
 so far for the price especially the 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.130
 entry level wonderful accesses quietly 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.900
 to my personal opinion that alone 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.030
 weight you see that you like me 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.950
 the thing here justifies it 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.650
 the crowd and we'll take a look now 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.229
 Just two things 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.200
 Let's start with the kindle app 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.909
 just read that way yes the sound is on 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.740
 a little bit different that that 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.170
 Retina display itself on the iPad is on 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.119
 the right ipad is whiter here 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.060
 is a bit warmer yellow finally 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.320
 so in the direction and I know now 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.960
 not if he sees now I'm looking for something 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.390
 very carefully so a bit pure and 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.180
 for the fact that you the camera schaaf 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.270
 always comes at the distance 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.590
 I just say 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.890
 Of course, the retina sees the better 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.270
 but that's where I come from 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.670
 zurande 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.040
 Quite an emergency I hold the ipad 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.450
 tick farther away than it usually does 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.110
 would do 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:13.170
 but I'm still good big 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.910
 fan of it , of course, fits 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.680
 we do not deprive ourselves of anything yet 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.680
 We'll be ten in three four years 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.690
 inch ipads have the weight this 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.330
 but we still have them now 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.030
 not the same game with times 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:31.980
 with ibooks I would also have school year 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:33.810
 be in the same place and say 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.610
 too good to make a difference to the kindle app 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.930
 no difference was both 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.420
 you can enjoy everything equally pleasant 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.670
 adjust size and change to 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.610
 read ipad mini in any case 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.160
 recommend so where i am a bit 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.480
 I'm disappointed with the twitter app 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.629
 I do not know what I can tell you here 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.120
 the twitter app is logged in 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:55.500
 the twitter app looks like 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.920
 probably a font size or 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.260
 written form or whatever 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.690
 it comes here by being so small 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.790
 and squeezed it just looks a 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.840
 tick cruelly from I once again so 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.430
 a little bit pure 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.010
 I hope you will not be there now 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.360
 bad at the whole camera rides 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.159
 So if I'm alone after the twitter 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:20.250
 would go app I would say just 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:22.349
 not then here pages normal if 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.950
 Now you should start with documents 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:28.080
 to look at or how it works 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.269
 that's how similar books ever read 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.940
 after how far you big there 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:35.459
 based font size you have but 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:39.530
 Absolutely okay, however, you can see 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.530
 here again clearly it is not retina 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.250
 the iec band, for example , i have there 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.349
 now around again briefly 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.099
 strummed around so a standard apple 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:49.110
 to have an app 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.780
 with such app so completely normal standard 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.920
 apps, that's not what you think 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:58.439
 you feel great that looks great 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.780
 the whole custom and down so great 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:02.489
 the whole apple apps look reasonable 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.849
 and can be used reasonably 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:08.370
 Let's go here in Sinners need for 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:10.110
 speed most wanted I do not care 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.500
 version just got new 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.209
 is 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.000
 and now we are here in the need for 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:20.430
 speed most wanted abdi looks cute 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:23.470
 that fits in the closer look 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.880
 Clearly I'm the thing now more stops 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.260
 then I notice the pixels as well 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.060
 and everything but on normal distance 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:36.040
 wonderful, I think only nice graphics 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:37.780
 for a tablet so wonderful class with it 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.330
 we have everything through now 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.760
 font apps even games 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.500
 oh yes exactly one is still missing 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.840
 normal website browser I have 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.930
 yes, just the ipad since he was the apple side 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.700
 suggested and the big font 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.770
 looks wonderful but down here 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.120
 this little thing is there then 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.160
 again on that this is not a 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.610
 Retina is the looks in comparison to 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.050
 right next to it group apology 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:06.790
 sweeping camera rides sees this 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:09.460
 not not very pleasant here 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:12.580
 who is on the technology sloth side 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:15.130
 the whole wipes again I say 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:18.940
 that can be both evenly so 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:21.190
 equals reading comparatively well 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:24.100
 to the conclusion without now an ipad 2 devices 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:26.860
 to have but I have the things 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.480
 here still looked and above all it 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.910
 has to be more like the retina 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:33.940
 the retina is of course better 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.600
 I'm absolutely ready to cut it 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.360
 close 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.340
 for that for the form factor 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:44.560
 or less the form factor 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:45.880
 he is the weight factor in the normal 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.010
 You see that right now 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.530
 with websites and resolution because miss 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.500
 I do not have much so despite that anyway 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:55.780
 missing a few inches here 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.700
 I still am 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.840
 I am not happy to regret it 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:02.500
 stood there for so long tonight 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:05.440
 I would recommend it so far around 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.900
 the people who are not used to retina 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.890
 Definitely for people the regina 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.070
 familiar with 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:14.830
 Personally, I can handle it, but you 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:16.690
 I have to advise everyone in advance 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:19.870
 First of all, to look at it with her 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:21.190
 Many wanted to take this step backwards 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:25.570
 thanks for looking i hope i could 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:27.370
 to help but that is difficult 

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.930
 such a subjective sense reasonable 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:32.020
 then convey reasonably 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:35.039
 Staying objective makes it good 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.039
 and until the next video
