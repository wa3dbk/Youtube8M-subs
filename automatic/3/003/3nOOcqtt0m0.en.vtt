00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.700 

I<00:00:08.580> like<00:00:09.150> to<00:00:09.300> talk<00:00:09.510> about<00:00:09.690> my<00:00:10.110> new<00:00:10.349> training

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
I like to talk about my new training

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.020 
I like to talk about my new training
concept<00:00:11.599> is<00:00:12.599> quite<00:00:13.200> simple<00:00:13.740> of<00:00:14.030> understanding

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
concept is quite simple of understanding

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.370 
concept is quite simple of understanding
which<00:00:15.360> I<00:00:15.509> will<00:00:15.660> explain<00:00:16.580> it's<00:00:17.580> called

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
which I will explain it's called

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.769 
which I will explain it's called
basically<00:00:19.380> standing<00:00:20.130> for<00:00:22.670> frequency<00:00:23.779> volume

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
basically standing for frequency volume

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:32.030 
basically standing for frequency volume
and<00:00:25.170> execution<00:00:25.769> so<00:00:26.570> frequency<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:31.040> volume

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
and execution so frequency is volume

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.970 
and execution so frequency is volume
obviously<00:00:32.430> how<00:00:32.759> much<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.239> actually<00:00:33.390> do<00:00:33.780> it

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
obviously how much you actually do it

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.119 
obviously how much you actually do it
work<00:00:34.980> out<00:00:35.420> an<00:00:36.420> execution<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:37.320> execution<00:00:37.890> of

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
work out an execution is execution of

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.380 
work out an execution is execution of
movement<00:00:38.579> how<00:00:39.270> correctly<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.379> do<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:41.390> to

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
movement how correctly you do it to

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.990 
movement how correctly you do it to
speed<00:00:43.430> angles<00:00:44.430> are<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.640> do<00:00:44.789> certain

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
speed angles are you do certain

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.540 
speed angles are you do certain
exercises<00:00:46.760> and<00:00:47.760> basically<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.950> have<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:49.980> problem

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
exercises and basically I have a problem

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.760 
exercises and basically I have a problem
every<00:00:50.789> time<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:51.030> ask<00:00:51.300> somebody<00:00:51.629> how<00:00:52.260> often<00:00:52.620> do

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
every time I ask somebody how often do

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.220 
every time I ask somebody how often do
you<00:00:52.829> train<00:00:53.300> they<00:00:54.300> will<00:00:54.480> either<00:00:54.660> say<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:54.989> me

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
you train they will either say to me

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.410 
you train they will either say to me
once<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.620> week<00:00:55.770> or<00:00:55.920> twice<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.219> week<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:57.300> not

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
once a week or twice a week and not

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.580 
once a week or twice a week and not
apprehend<00:00:58.020> why<00:00:58.350> we<00:00:58.620> have<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.920> be<00:00:59.039> limited<00:00:59.489> in

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
apprehend why we have to be limited in

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:07.760 
apprehend why we have to be limited in
thinking<00:01:01.590> in<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.280> week<00:01:02.539> again<00:01:03.539> wages<00:01:03.960> are

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.719 

wages<00:01:08.580> time<00:01:09.320> weakness<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.500> we<00:01:10.619> have<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:11.580> the

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
wages time weakness that we have so the

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.109 
wages time weakness that we have so the
muscles<00:01:12.090> don't<00:01:12.210> know<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.659> so<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.950> would<00:01:14.940> like

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
muscles don't know that so I would like

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.730 
muscles don't know that so I would like
to<00:01:15.180> somebody<00:01:15.659> said<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:15.990> me<00:01:16.110> yeah<00:01:16.290> training

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
to somebody said to me yeah training

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.620 
to somebody said to me yeah training
four<00:01:17.040> days<00:01:17.250> every<00:01:17.280> five<00:01:17.729> days<00:01:18.000> or<00:01:18.270> seven<00:01:18.600> days

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
four days every five days or seven days

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.680 
four days every five days or seven days
but<00:01:19.290> nobody<00:01:19.590> gives<00:01:19.770> me<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:19.979> answer<00:01:20.690> in

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
but nobody gives me the answer in

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.620 
but nobody gives me the answer in
reality<00:01:22.229> there<00:01:22.380> has<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.560> be<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:23.250> limit<00:01:24.210> up<00:01:24.600> to

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
reality there has to be a limit up to

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.780 
reality there has to be a limit up to
which<00:01:24.810> point<00:01:25.130> the<00:01:26.130> muscle

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
which point the muscle

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.060 
which point the muscle
if<00:01:27.119> you've<00:01:27.450> trained<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.899> correctly<00:01:28.259> grow<00:01:29.960> and

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
if you've trained it correctly grow and

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.010 
if you've trained it correctly grow and
you<00:01:32.070> sustain<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.729> growth<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.509> strength<00:01:33.869> a

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
you sustain that growth and strength a

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.850 
you sustain that growth and strength a
specific<00:01:34.890> time<00:01:35.130> after<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:36.170> that<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.500> start

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
specific time after that that you start

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.669 
specific time after that that you start
going<00:01:37.950> backwards<00:01:38.250> again<00:01:38.550> dig<00:01:39.330> down<00:01:39.679> the

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
going backwards again dig down the

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:42.410 
going backwards again dig down the
original<00:01:41.100> size<00:01:41.429> and<00:01:41.460> strength<00:01:41.910> that<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.210> had

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
original size and strength that you had

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.010 
original size and strength that you had
so<00:01:43.380> we<00:01:43.530> have<00:01:43.679> to<00:01:43.830> get<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.100> right<00:01:44.310> which

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
so we have to get that right which

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.710 
so we have to get that right which
scientifically<00:01:46.280> proven<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.420> between<00:01:48.420> four

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
scientifically proven that between four

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.639 
scientifically proven that between four
and<00:01:48.750> five<00:01:48.899> days<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.280> maximum<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:51.210> you

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
and five days is the maximum that you

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.669 
and five days is the maximum that you
allowed<00:01:52.649> more<00:01:53.070> or<00:01:53.190> less<00:01:53.720> to<00:01:54.720> stay<00:01:55.050> at<00:01:55.470> that

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679 
allowed more or less to stay at that

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:57.770 
allowed more or less to stay at that
point<00:01:55.979> before<00:01:56.160> you<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:56.940> must<00:01:57.149> start<00:01:57.509> going

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
point before you you must start going

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.320 
point before you you must start going
backwards<00:01:58.159> but<00:01:59.159> most<00:01:59.399> people<00:01:59.700> train<00:01:59.909> once<00:02:00.149> a

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
backwards but most people train once a

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.279 
backwards but most people train once a
week<00:02:00.509> which<00:02:01.440> is<00:02:01.560> every<00:02:01.800> seven<00:02:02.100> days<00:02:03.170> part<00:02:04.170> of

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
week which is every seven days part of

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:06.730 
week which is every seven days part of
the<00:02:04.380> reason<00:02:04.710> is<00:02:04.800> because<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.490> go<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.119> next

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
the reason is because you go to the next

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.880 
the reason is because you go to the next
which<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:07.979> volume<00:02:08.340> people<00:02:09.209> do<00:02:09.360> too<00:02:09.690> many

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
which is the volume people do too many

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.620 
which is the volume people do too many
sets<00:02:10.890> too<00:02:11.220> many<00:02:11.400> exercises<00:02:12.120> for<00:02:12.269> each<00:02:12.360> body

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
sets too many exercises for each body

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.979 
sets too many exercises for each body
part<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.769> part<00:02:14.010> of<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.190> reason<00:02:14.630> that's<00:02:15.630> done

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
part and part of the reason that's done

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.289 
part and part of the reason that's done
of<00:02:16.590> course<00:02:16.920> people<00:02:17.190> are<00:02:17.400> doing<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.790> exercises

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
of course people are doing the exercises

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.160 
of course people are doing the exercises
wrong<00:02:19.549> so<00:02:20.549> they<00:02:20.670> need<00:02:20.850> to<00:02:21.000> do<00:02:21.180> more<00:02:21.360> volume<00:02:21.780> to

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
wrong so they need to do more volume to

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.860 
wrong so they need to do more volume to
create<00:02:22.470> that<00:02:22.620> relation<00:02:23.340> but<00:02:24.269> the<00:02:24.450> problem<00:02:24.780> you

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
create that relation but the problem you

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.449 
create that relation but the problem you
have<00:02:25.049> if<00:02:25.230> you're<00:02:25.440> a<00:02:25.470> natural<00:02:25.920> body<00:02:26.100> builder

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
have if you're a natural body builder

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.490 
have if you're a natural body builder
and<00:02:26.610> your<00:02:26.820> no<00:02:26.940> using<00:02:27.299> any<00:02:27.450> chemicals<00:02:27.959> is<00:02:28.260> how

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
and your no using any chemicals is how

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.990 
and your no using any chemicals is how
the<00:02:28.560> hell<00:02:28.799> do<00:02:28.920> you<00:02:28.950> recover<00:02:29.310> by<00:02:29.549> doing<00:02:29.790> order

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
the hell do you recover by doing order

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.250 
the hell do you recover by doing order
for<00:02:30.209> you

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
for you

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.250 
for you
and<00:02:32.349> then<00:02:32.500> his<00:02:32.739> execution<00:02:33.400> of<00:02:33.489> each<00:02:33.610> exercise

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
and then his execution of each exercise

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.399 
and then his execution of each exercise
came<00:02:35.260> back<00:02:35.439> to<00:02:35.590> the<00:02:35.709> same<00:02:36.430> situation<00:02:36.610> again

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409
