 310 replacement golf on the golf 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:18.360
 sixth 11 years on the radio 510 adelphi 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.200
 you must first remove the trim here this 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.489
 plastic 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:25.980
 it fastens on several latches 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:33.030
 I will use prepared 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:38.040
 clothespin is important to fit it there so 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:46.140
 so as not to break the latches themselves 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:48.780
 they are very fragile now the first 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.079
 complex as always and too deep 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.230
 also can not be thrust as you can 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.690
 bend into the plastic from the inside it's over here 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.510
 there was a latch down here three more 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.170
 here here and here approximately 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.170
 now i will be them 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:23.740
 there is now in the middle one more you 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:28.860
 all four deliveries no it's down 3 by 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.860
 sides on 1s each book 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.270
 doesn't want 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.290
 because come on this this fog 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:57.660
 eat it turns out which is easier first by 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:02.190
 side openings so that later my case 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:28.620
 it turned out that everything is there after all and now 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:36.050
 upper there is there is this here it is 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:36.050
 fastens one two three here 1 2 3 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:49.470
 now unscrew the radio itself 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.470
 mounted on 4 bolts 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.739
 unscrew 4 bolts 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.840
 little by little slowly 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.370
 We take out the Baltic ours 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.760
 hide close 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.760
 what then screw back 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.610
 neatly begin here with shouts 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.319
 to sense 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.640
 manat 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:44.560
 get off 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:44.560
 and here we have an antenna output 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:58.160
 You are on Ecuador, that's grandson 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:04:00.170

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.440
 goes bend it all taken out 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:06.950
 jump out the error yes and the antenna on 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:11.240
 latch and click move away take out 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:14.090
 All of our 310 then smoothly move to 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:20.330
 another model of golf and now we turn on 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:27.460
 510 dlc connect to our available our 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:27.460
 antennas and include hotlog 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:35.940
 we stick it stupid 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.940
 and snap do not forget to snap 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:48.130
 let her check before him 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:59.080
 before twisting it i would 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:05:05.350
 checked so that something is working 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:10.889
 i.e. internet means code was written to me 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:14.159
 1 code entered here is written 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:17.240
 for my tape recorder 1774 for each 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:19.860
 tape recorder he is his individual 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:25.249
 so we introduce 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:25.249
 this is my code 17 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:33.020
 everything 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:38.599
 confirmation was the radio turned on 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:43.259
 try to turn on the disk click to select 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:47.689
 which as far as I remember sitting the changer 

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:47.689
 6 discs loaded 1 disc 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:14.139
 turned on the disk the disk works wonderfully 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:17.909

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:21.749
