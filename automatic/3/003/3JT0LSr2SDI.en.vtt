way is to actually be able to describe

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.700 
way is to actually be able to describe
it<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.390> saying<00:01:30.570> add<00:01:30.780> note<00:01:31.049> gives<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.619> the

things and this is a very nice and

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.100 
things and this is a very nice and
efficient<00:01:35.670> way<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.790> doing<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.210> where<00:01:36.960> this

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
efficient way of doing it where this

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.140 
efficient way of doing it where this
application<00:01:37.650> really<00:01:37.920> shines<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.640> great

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
application really shines is it great

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.569 
application really shines is it great

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
where it is the application itself works

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:40.559 
where it is the application itself works
pretty<00:02:39.310> well<00:02:39.430> I<00:02:39.700> like<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.090> fact<00:02:40.209> that<00:02:40.390> it

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
pretty well I like the fact that it

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.600 
pretty well I like the fact that it
actually<00:02:40.690> is<00:02:40.989> it<00:02:41.230> has<00:02:41.410> very<00:02:41.799> nice<00:02:41.980> aesthetics

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
actually is it has very nice aesthetics

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.520 
actually is it has very nice aesthetics
as<00:02:42.700> far<00:02:42.880> as<00:02:42.970> the<00:02:43.060> Android<00:02:43.360> L<00:02:43.540> material<00:02:44.230> design

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
as far as the Android L material design

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.530 
as far as the Android L material design
functionality<00:02:45.280> going<00:02:45.519> on<00:02:45.610> I<00:02:45.790> also<00:02:46.239> like<00:02:46.510> the

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
functionality going on I also like the

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.850 
functionality going on I also like the
fact<00:02:46.660> that<00:02:46.959> it's<00:02:47.140> simple<00:02:47.470> enough<00:02:47.530> that<00:02:47.709> you

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
fact that it's simple enough that you

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.710 
fact that it's simple enough that you
