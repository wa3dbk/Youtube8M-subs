00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.660 
just kind of made sense you know the
body's<00:02:06.869> pretty<00:02:07.110> smart<00:02:07.500> so<00:02:07.860> if<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.340> give<00:02:08.520> it<00:02:08.610> a

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
body's pretty smart so if you give it a

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.100 
body's pretty smart so if you give it a
chance<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:09.000> do<00:02:09.179> what<00:02:09.209> it<00:02:09.450> wants<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.780> do<00:02:09.929> it'll

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
chance to do what it wants to do it'll

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.199 
chance to do what it wants to do it'll
probably<00:02:10.200> work<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:10.860> out<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.250> that<00:02:11.970> was<00:02:12.090> the

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
probably work it out and that was the

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.430 
probably work it out and that was the
case

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
case

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.010 
case
so<00:02:13.890> what<00:02:14.040> I've<00:02:14.160> done<00:02:14.340> is<00:02:14.610> mapped<00:02:15.000> my<00:02:15.690> entire

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
so what I've done is mapped my entire

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.770 
so what I've done is mapped my entire
recovery<00:02:16.710> the<00:02:17.370> first<00:02:17.640> 90<00:02:18.030> days<00:02:18.060> in<00:02:18.510> particular

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
recovery the first 90 days in particular

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.120 
recovery the first 90 days in particular
which<00:02:19.140> are<00:02:19.260> just<00:02:19.380> hell<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:20.070> then<00:02:21.950> and<00:02:22.950> then

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
which are just hell and then and then

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.200 
which are just hell and then and then
the<00:02:23.280> very<00:02:24.140> I'd<00:02:25.140> say<00:02:25.290> linear<00:02:26.030> recovery<00:02:27.030> from

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
the very I'd say linear recovery from

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.290 
the very I'd say linear recovery from
there<00:02:27.450> as<00:02:27.690> I<00:02:28.500> film<00:02:28.710> this<00:02:28.830> video<00:02:28.980> I'm<00:02:29.430> 13<00:02:29.970> months

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
there as I film this video I'm 13 months

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.210 
there as I film this video I'm 13 months
into<00:02:30.540> recovery<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:31.080> my<00:02:31.320> life<00:02:31.530> is<00:02:31.710> completely

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
into recovery and my life is completely

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.280 
into recovery and my life is completely
back<00:02:32.490> to<00:02:32.520> normal<00:02:32.670> I<00:02:33.150> wouldn't<00:02:34.020> say<00:02:34.110> that<00:02:34.140> I'm

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
back to normal I wouldn't say that I'm

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.350 
back to normal I wouldn't say that I'm
100%<00:02:34.740> healed<00:02:35.310> because<00:02:35.700> there's<00:02:35.910> still<00:02:36.090> some

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
100% healed because there's still some

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.780 
100% healed because there's still some
