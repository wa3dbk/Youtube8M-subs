today's<00:00:17.670> YouTube<00:00:18.030> video<00:00:18.270> moment<00:00:19.700> we<00:00:20.700> are<00:00:21.290> back

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:22.290 
today's YouTube video moment we are back

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.609 
today's YouTube video moment we are back
in<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.560> garage<00:00:23.420> working<00:00:24.420> on<00:00:24.720> assembling<00:00:25.320> the

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
in the garage working on assembling the

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.760 
in the garage working on assembling the
BMW<00:00:26.189> engine<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:30.470> unfortunately<00:00:31.470> it's<00:00:31.680> a

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:31.770 
BMW engine and unfortunately it's a

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.430 
BMW engine and unfortunately it's a
really<00:00:32.040> nice<00:00:32.189> day<00:00:32.520> out<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:33.120> I'd<00:00:33.930> rather<00:00:34.199> be

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
really nice day out and I'd rather be

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.320 
really nice day out and I'd rather be
out<00:00:34.530> on<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.830> water<00:00:35.510> but<00:00:36.949> due<00:00:37.949> to<00:00:37.980> some<00:00:38.400> sad<00:00:39.090> and

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:39.330 
out on the water but due to some sad and

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.570 
out on the water but due to some sad and
unfortunate<00:00:39.739> circumstances<00:00:43.309> can't<00:00:44.309> get<00:00:44.460> the

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:44.580 
unfortunate circumstances can't get the

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.540 
unfortunate circumstances can't get the
boat<00:00:44.730> out<00:00:44.879> at<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.120> moment<00:00:45.530> there's<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.739> barge

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
boat out at the moment there's a barge

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.090 
boat out at the moment there's a barge
that's<00:00:47.820> been<00:00:48.030> doing<00:00:48.269> some<00:00:48.449> dredging<00:00:48.840> there

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
that's been doing some dredging there

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.640 
that's been doing some dredging there
the<00:00:50.100> guy<00:00:50.280> that<00:00:50.580> owns<00:00:51.540> the<00:00:51.960> company<00:00:52.170> passed

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.650 
the guy that owns the company passed

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.579 
the guy that owns the company passed
away<00:00:52.920> suddenly<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.809> it<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:54.989> blocking<00:00:55.470> our

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:55.589 
away suddenly and it is blocking our

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:00.590 
away suddenly and it is blocking our
boat<00:00:55.769> at<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:55.979> moment<00:00:57.019> so<00:00:58.489> other<00:00:59.510> other<00:01:00.510> things

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
boat at the moment so other other things

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.939 
boat at the moment so other other things
to<00:01:01.080> do<00:01:01.260> on<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.979> list<00:01:02.570> was<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.839> do<00:01:04.409> some<00:01:04.589> work<00:01:04.769> on

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
to do on the list was to do some work on

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.250 
to do on the list was to do some work on
this<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.540> we've<00:01:06.540> put<00:01:06.810> quite<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.229> few<00:01:07.470> items<00:01:07.590> on

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
this so we've put quite a few items on

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
this so we've put quite a few items on
probably<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.350> biggest<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.770> which<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.070> the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
probably the biggest of which is the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.750 
probably the biggest of which is the
intake<00:01:12.030> manifold<00:01:12.630> here<00:01:12.960> for<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:14.130> electronic

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
intake manifold here for the electronic

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.170 
intake manifold here for the electronic
fuel<00:01:15.030> injection<00:01:15.590> we<00:01:16.590> get<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:17.159> coolant<00:01:18.000> bypass

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
fuel injection we get a coolant bypass

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.310 
fuel injection we get a coolant bypass
pipe<00:01:18.810> down<00:01:19.740> here<00:01:20.359> yeah<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.899> original

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
pipe down here yeah the original

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.499 
pipe down here yeah the original
manifolds<00:01:22.979> have<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.310> water<00:01:23.609> jacket<00:01:23.880> built<00:01:24.299> in

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
manifolds have a water jacket built in

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.859 
manifolds have a water jacket built in
this<00:01:25.439> one<00:01:25.770> does<00:01:26.070> not<00:01:26.299> so<00:01:27.299> we<00:01:27.450> have<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.689> come<00:01:27.840> up

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
this one does not so we have to come up

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.980 
this one does not so we have to come up
with<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.200> way<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.380> bypass<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.719> feature<00:01:30.719> that

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
with a way to bypass that feature that

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.569 
with a way to bypass that feature that
we<00:01:31.109> took<00:01:31.259> out<00:01:32.869> along<00:01:33.869> with<00:01:33.899> that<00:01:34.399> we<00:01:35.399> have<00:01:35.700> the

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
we took out along with that we have the

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:41.090 
we took out along with that we have the
325is<00:01:38.579> throttle<00:01:39.210> body<00:01:39.390> here<00:01:39.719> which<00:01:40.710> as<00:01:40.950> you

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
325is throttle body here which as you

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.169 
325is throttle body here which as you
can<00:01:41.250> see<00:01:41.429> it<00:01:41.549> has<00:01:42.020> something<00:01:43.020> like<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:44.179> 62

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
can see it has something like a 62

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:47.469 
can see it has something like a 62
millimeter<00:01:45.899> diameter<00:01:46.229> or<00:01:46.770> something

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
millimeter diameter or something

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.539 
millimeter diameter or something
much<00:01:48.479> much<00:01:48.780> larger<00:01:48.990> than<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.499> original<00:01:50.719> 318i

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
much much larger than the original 318i

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.069 
much much larger than the original 318i
throttle<00:01:53.549> body<00:01:53.759> so<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.749> can<00:01:54.960> get

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
throttle body so that you can get

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.730 
throttle body so that you can get
sufficient<00:01:55.710> airflow<00:01:57.079> for<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.200> larger<00:01:58.560> engine

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
sufficient airflow for the larger engine

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.149 
sufficient airflow for the larger engine
here<00:02:00.109> again<00:02:01.109> it<00:02:01.289> gets<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.499> the<00:02:01.649> coolant

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
here again it gets you the coolant

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.260 
here again it gets you the coolant
bypass<00:02:02.280> pipe<00:02:03.890> down<00:02:04.890> on<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.100> bottom<00:02:05.249> the<00:02:06.060> oil

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
bypass pipe down on the bottom the oil

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.010 
bypass pipe down on the bottom the oil
pan<00:02:06.539> is<00:02:06.569> now<00:02:06.869> in<00:02:07.020> place<00:02:08.270> the<00:02:09.270> left-hand<00:02:09.750> side

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
pan is now in place the left-hand side

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.000 
pan is now in place the left-hand side
here<00:02:10.050> we<00:02:10.830> have<00:02:11.100> our<00:02:11.660> electronic<00:02:12.660> ignition

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
here we have our electronic ignition

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.700 
here we have our electronic ignition
timing<00:02:14.010> gear<00:02:14.550> as<00:02:14.730> well<00:02:14.930> as<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.200> crankshaft

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
timing gear as well as the crankshaft

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:22.760 
timing gear as well as the crankshaft
pulley<00:02:19.760> engine<00:02:20.760> mount<00:02:21.410> obviously<00:02:22.410> one<00:02:22.530> on<00:02:22.680> the

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
pulley engine mount obviously one on the

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.589 
pulley engine mount obviously one on the
other<00:02:22.890> side

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
other side

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.580 
other side
and<00:02:24.689> then<00:02:25.219> this<00:02:26.219> little<00:02:26.519> guy<00:02:26.700> up<00:02:26.730> here<00:02:27.530> this<00:02:28.530> is

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
and then this little guy up here this is

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.319 
and then this little guy up here this is
one<00:02:28.889> of<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.069> one<00:02:29.489> of<00:02:29.519> the<00:02:29.609> first<00:02:29.879> things<00:02:30.150> that

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
one of the one of the first things that

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:31.670 
one of the one of the first things that
I've<00:02:30.420> probably<00:02:30.599> made<00:02:30.900> up<00:02:31.019> for<00:02:31.230> this<00:02:31.349> even

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
I've probably made up for this even

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.309 
I've probably made up for this even
before<00:02:31.829> I<00:02:32.040> decided<00:02:32.430> that<00:02:32.870> this<00:02:33.870> was<00:02:34.109> going<00:02:34.230> to

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
before I decided that this was going to

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.280 
before I decided that this was going to
be<00:02:34.439> the<00:02:34.590> engine<00:02:34.799> the<00:02:34.920> gut<00:02:35.099> rebuilt<00:02:36.079> but<00:02:37.079> this

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
be the engine the gut rebuilt but this

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.830 
be the engine the gut rebuilt but this
is<00:02:37.469> the<00:02:37.670> mechanical<00:02:38.670> fuel<00:02:38.879> pump<00:02:38.909> block<00:02:39.569> off

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
is the mechanical fuel pump block off

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.920 
is the mechanical fuel pump block off
plate<00:02:40.049> so<00:02:40.379> when<00:02:40.530> I<00:02:40.560> got<00:02:40.769> the<00:02:40.920> car<00:02:41.329> it<00:02:42.329> still<00:02:42.659> had

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
plate so when I got the car it still had

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.740 
plate so when I got the car it still had
the<00:02:43.200> mechanical<00:02:43.769> fuel<00:02:43.980> pump<00:02:44.040> on<00:02:44.489> it<00:02:44.629> but<00:02:45.629> it

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
the mechanical fuel pump on it but it

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.830 
the mechanical fuel pump on it but it
wasn't<00:02:46.049> connected<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.469> anything<00:02:46.739> so<00:02:47.129> just<00:02:47.840> you

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
wasn't connected to anything so just you

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.240 
wasn't connected to anything so just you
know<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.079> ends<00:02:49.349> had<00:02:49.439> been<00:02:49.590> plugged<00:02:49.889> but<00:02:50.159> it

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
know the ends had been plugged but it

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.659 
know the ends had been plugged but it
was<00:02:50.370> just<00:02:50.579> pumping<00:02:51.540> air<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:52.219> the<00:02:53.219> system<00:02:53.549> had

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:53.669 
was just pumping air and the system had

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:55.239 
was just pumping air and the system had
been<00:02:54.060> converted<00:02:54.540> to<00:02:54.569> a<00:02:54.689> low<00:02:54.930> pressure

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:55.249 
been converted to a low pressure

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:59.330 
been converted to a low pressure
electronic<00:02:56.249> fuel<00:02:56.519> pump<00:02:57.680> this<00:02:58.680> plate<00:02:59.010> allows

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
electronic fuel pump this plate allows

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.759 
electronic fuel pump this plate allows
us<00:02:59.579> to<00:02:59.760> get<00:03:00.000> rid<00:03:00.209> of<00:03:00.239> that<00:03:00.510> mechanical<00:03:01.109> fuel

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
us to get rid of that mechanical fuel

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.920 
us to get rid of that mechanical fuel
pump<00:03:01.799> and<00:03:02.280> in<00:03:02.879> our<00:03:03.030> case<00:03:03.269> we're<00:03:03.510> also<00:03:03.629> going<00:03:03.870> to

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
pump and in our case we're also going to

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.229 
pump and in our case we're also going to
get<00:03:04.049> rid<00:03:04.109> of<00:03:04.290> that<00:03:04.409> original<00:03:05.060> electronic<00:03:06.060> fuel

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
get rid of that original electronic fuel

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.080 
get rid of that original electronic fuel
pump<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:06.780> go<00:03:07.349> with<00:03:07.530> a<00:03:07.680> high<00:03:08.340> pressure<00:03:08.669> unit

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
pump and go with a high pressure unit

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.099 
pump and go with a high pressure unit
that<00:03:09.180> fits<00:03:09.419> inside<00:03:09.599> the<00:03:09.959> fuel<00:03:10.169> tank<00:03:12.109> and

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
that fits inside the fuel tank and

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.559 
that fits inside the fuel tank and
that's<00:03:13.319> again<00:03:14.219> would<00:03:14.579> be<00:03:14.699> necessary<00:03:14.849> for<00:03:15.299> the

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
that's again would be necessary for the

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.959 
that's again would be necessary for the
electronic<00:03:16.079> fuel<00:03:16.319> injection<00:03:16.349> they<00:03:16.969> require

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:17.969 
electronic fuel injection they require

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:20.569 
electronic fuel injection they require
substantially<00:03:18.689> more<00:03:18.900> pressure<00:03:19.260> than<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.590> you

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
substantially more pressure than the you

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:27.640 
substantially more pressure than the you
know<00:03:20.699> 2<00:03:21.060> to<00:03:21.209> 5<00:03:21.449> psi<00:03:22.139> of<00:03:22.169> a<00:03:22.430> carbureted<00:03:23.719> system

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.970 

but<00:03:28.650> I<00:03:28.970> think<00:03:29.970> that's

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
but I think that's

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.100 
but I think that's
that's<00:03:32.580> about<00:03:32.849> it<00:03:32.910> while<00:03:33.720> we're<00:03:33.900> in<00:03:34.020> here

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.920 

I<00:03:38.150> know<00:03:39.150> I<00:03:39.180> posted<00:03:39.660> a<00:03:39.750> couple<00:03:39.930> days<00:03:40.200> ago<00:03:40.410> about

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
I know I posted a couple days ago about

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.820 
I know I posted a couple days ago about
breaking<00:03:42.930> a<00:03:43.050> wheel<00:03:43.260> on<00:03:43.710> the<00:03:44.040> TT<00:03:45.530> if<00:03:46.530> you<00:03:46.680> look

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
breaking a wheel on the TT if you look

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.070 
breaking a wheel on the TT if you look
right<00:03:47.040> here<00:03:47.100> there's<00:03:47.460> quite<00:03:48.000> a<00:03:48.540> big<00:03:48.780> crack

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
right here there's quite a big crack

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.170 
right here there's quite a big crack
actually<00:03:49.650> it's<00:03:49.800> not<00:03:50.700> a<00:03:50.760> hairline<00:03:51.120> crack

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
actually it's not a hairline crack

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.770 
actually it's not a hairline crack
anymore<00:03:52.790> enough<00:03:53.790> so<00:03:54.030> that<00:03:54.060> I<00:03:54.390> had<00:03:54.750> a

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
anymore enough so that I had a

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.540 
anymore enough so that I had a
reoccurring<00:03:55.320> flat<00:03:55.530> tire<00:03:55.800> and<00:03:56.040> pulled<00:03:56.460> the

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
reoccurring flat tire and pulled the

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.320 
reoccurring flat tire and pulled the
wheel<00:03:56.730> off<00:03:56.940> to<00:03:57.090> find<00:03:57.330> out<00:03:57.480> line<00:03:59.330> fortunately

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
wheel off to find out line fortunately

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:01.610 
wheel off to find out line fortunately
there<00:04:00.480> was<00:04:00.570> a<00:04:00.630> crack<00:04:00.900> in<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:01.110> rim<00:04:01.320> I<00:04:01.470> don't

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
there was a crack in the rim I don't

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.920 
there was a crack in the rim I don't
know<00:04:02.450> what<00:04:03.450> the<00:04:03.570> cause<00:04:03.780> of<00:04:05.000> it<00:04:06.000> was<00:04:06.209> but<00:04:06.690> I

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
know what the cause of it was but I

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.050 
know what the cause of it was but I
ordered<00:04:07.320> a<00:04:07.560> new<00:04:07.590> one<00:04:07.740> on<00:04:07.980> eBay<00:04:08.340> or<00:04:08.610> a<00:04:08.640> new<00:04:08.790> used

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
ordered a new one on eBay or a new used

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.130 
ordered a new one on eBay or a new used
one<00:04:09.360> and<00:04:09.980> I<00:04:10.980> should<00:04:11.520> be<00:04:11.640> in<00:04:11.790> pretty<00:04:12.450> soon<00:04:12.750> I

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
one and I should be in pretty soon I

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:21.290 
one and I should be in pretty soon I
hope<00:04:14.270> that's<00:04:15.270> all<00:04:15.420> for<00:04:15.630> now<00:04:16.760> yeah<00:04:18.290> yeah
