00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.730
 another video 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.429
 today it's about the jabra motion uci 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.080
 place a very progressive 

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:11.820
 bluetooth did something exactly the same 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.230
 we can look at many now 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:22.560
 thanks to the abba the links are like 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:24.570
 always below in the video description in 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.369
 scope of delivery is next to the 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.369
 headset even a docking station 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.330
 and also a power adapter for charging 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.399
 at the socket 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.590
 who believes now that was all that 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.690
 was far from the docking station 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.430
 is at the same time a storage box 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.500
 for further accessories 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.480
 So we have two more victims here 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.440
 a third is already there 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.480
 on the headset the headset takes place here 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.570
 and then we have another usb here 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.010
 cable from usb to micro usb to 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.930
 connect to the computer 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.030
 and we have a little one left 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.649
 bluetooth dongle for the headset lets 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.539
 not just bluetooth with one 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.829
 use a smartphone or a tablet 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.619
 but also with a windows computer 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.880
 or a mac we come to a few 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.340
 technical data 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.170
 it is used here bluetooth 4.0 what 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.549
 very exciting on the one hand 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.560
 is and on the other side one 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.750
 Range of up to 100 meters 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.369
 It really makes it possible 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.990
 considering that the normal bluetooth 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.420
 always reach about ten 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.420
 meters was the internal battery supplies 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.250
 about seven hours talk time and 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.470
 360 hours standby time that's what I think 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.960
 for the size of the network and the design 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.270
 for an acceptable battery life 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.180
 We also have a double microphone 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.740
 and several technologies already 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.909
 used more often and really 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.560
 have established 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.420
 we have noise, for example 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.860
 Canceling with the function new 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.750
 blackout it will be the 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.149
 background noise filtered out with it 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.590
 we only hear you speak 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.600
 also have a wind new 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.189
 protection speak the wind becomes 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.390
 bit filtered so that even if it is 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.070
 I am still here outside 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.649
 can make reasonable calls and 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.840
 besides, we have hd voice with yours 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.090
 I agree with you 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.909
 to the quality and also to the audio quality 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.459
 we'll get the headset later 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.220
 very light weighs only 17 5 grams 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.530
 pretty little actually and besides 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.480
 nfc is still on board with so near fell 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.069
 communication if you have a mobile phone 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.690
 what this feature supports 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.430
 then you can use the two devices completely 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.650
 easily pair them by just bringing them close 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.690
 old one really very much 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.459
 Cool thing besides, we have one 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.129
 Motion detection if we can do that 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.900
 headset, for example, on the table 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.239
 have a lie and now comes a call 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.280
 in and we just take it up and 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.750
 then move to recognize our ear 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.970
 that would have us that this movement 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.200
 have executed and goes automatically 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.239
 for you 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.010
 that means your greek call of the heart 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.560
 you just take it up and 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.730
 You can start talking immediately because the call 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.530
 then it works 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.019
 also really good and I think that 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.099
 Function really great on the headset 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.599
 we touch some and 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:56.940
 setting options 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.620
 we turn it on by the arm 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.760
 fold out or we switch 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.659
 make it out of her arm again 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.060
 close 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:04.680
 then we have a button up here 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.360
 with which we can accept calls 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.709
 caller can hang up at 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.030
 Double-click the redial 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.220
 can press 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.010
 another button is here 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.379
 At the bottom of the microphone in the reason when we are there 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.659
 then press the headset 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:20.700
 Say a command then we can 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:23.220
 for example, say battery and the headset 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.650
 tell us how long the battery life still is 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.450
 is or we can say pairing and 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.610
 the headset automatically goes into the 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.209
 peric mode to get new bluetooth devices too 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.430
 couple 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.489
 this is really a cool thing 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.390
 we keep on up here 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.530
 touch panel around the volume 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.299
 adjust 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.860
 that means we can on the ear just like that 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.930
 drive over it and do not have to 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.430
 grope any head and can at 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.140
 louder and quieter 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.659
 we can also direct the headset here 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.849
 load or we take the just shown 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:51.989
 docking station stop here 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:54.780
 that's just possible 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:57.150
 very very easy and then we can 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.550
 here at the docking station just that 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.820
 micro usb cable on it 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:03.410
 and could then load it with me 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.090
 continue to the motion uci 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.800
 adapt to any place shape 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.260
 we have a very first here 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.780
 flexible top which is good for 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.160
 euro rum puts and also does not push and 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.050
 We can also check the height of the 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.160
 Here we also set the ear 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.500
 You can do it all here 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.120
 pull out or keep on ever 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.670
 after what is the height of the whole 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.650
 If you do not wear that right 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.870
 would like to set it like this now 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.370
 would not be a problem then you can just 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.310
 Turn the earcups by holding them 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.440
 looks completely and then turns here once 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.880
 then he puts in such a piece again 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.560
 then she does not let herself anymore 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.360
 turn and now you can do the whole thing 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.680
 wear on the left I think that's great 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.900
 practically so you can just do it 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.810
 Perfect fit and comfort 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.300
 is really really good there 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.070
 expresses nothing that is comfortable and thereby 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.140
 that it is so easy bothers too 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.300
 not a bit with any movement 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.130
 and so on it just fits right 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.290
 good on the ear you hardly notice it 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.420
 and what else do you want with a headset? 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.370
 Of course you need one more 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.500
 best possible audio quality and a 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.300
 decent microphone and both 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.880
 things I can only say that motion 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.780
 uci brings really great super good 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.610
 quality with 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.430
 both that with yours 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.650
 arrives crystal clear noise is not 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.090
 just sounds good 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.220
 not least because of these 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.650
 whole technologies hd voice new 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.110
 blackout wind protection and what knows 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.790
 I do not do it all in any case 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.919
 Quality is astrein 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.240
 and also what can happen to you 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:30.200
 Really see or hear 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.600
 to let 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.310
 and that's really really good I 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.540
 my conversation partner was always very 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.669
 well understand even if i for example 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.680
 in the car seats and the ambient noise 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:41.060
 by the way, a bit higher 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.560
 if you 're in the car with that 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.750
 on the phone are the 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.800
 background noise amazingly low 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.960
 because she's just a little bit 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.300
 be filtered out speak the whole 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.669
 noise this to rome are run from 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.200
 Do not come here at yours 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:56.390
 so strong and that's just it 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.200
 Really to a joy with it 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:59.960
 to phone 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.430
 for iphone and ipad users there are 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.810
 a free app with the us 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.280
 make different settings 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.990
 Here we can see the first 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.760
 remaining talk time and with 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.410
 which device does that 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.610
 Whole coupled is we can do it 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.230
 namely in two devices 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:14.260
 at the same time, for example, pair up 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:15.100
 the pc and the smartphone and then 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.660
 we can get down here in the 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.410
 attitudes and there are some 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.090
 choose 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:21.130
 For example, we have prefabricated ones 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.110
 For example, profiles sounded here once 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.640
 for the car then just the whole 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.920
 sound settings volume and so on 

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.910
 then optimized for the car then 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:32.290
 we can still go through this here 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:33.520
 scrolling calls privacy battery and 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:34.900
 you can stop a whole lot 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.010
 make settings 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.230
 besides, we still have the 

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:40.060
 possibility to create audio notes 

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:41.860
 So that's a really cool one 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.780
 Extension still I think it's very good 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.810
 that you have these profiles around here 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:48.910
 very fast with just a few touches 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:52.660
 so to speak or press display 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:55.270
 make a setting the motion 

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.800
 So uci plus from java is almost a 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:59.050
 perfect all-rounder 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.030
 There is a lot of technology on board you 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:02.530
 can it super road use by 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.230
 but you can do it too 

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:06.910
 home use skype voice over ip on pc 

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:10.090
 system does not matter 

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:11.440
 everywhere it is usable i like it 

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:13.990
 that really good from the 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.430
 Audio quality and the microphone quality 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:17.770
 this is really knotless 

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:19.540
 we have a very large scope of delivery 

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:22.060
 in this model variant here 

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:23.770
 There is also the headset without them 

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.090
 I say travel box 

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:26.920
 that means there you only have the headset 

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.690
 and i believe the bluetooth receiver 

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.400
 and of course also has a charging cable 

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:33.760
 clear 

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:35.320
 that costs 99 99 on Amazon 

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.120
 Available link is and in the video 

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.590
 description and if you have it 

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.660
 want as I have shown you here 

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:43.930
 So with the case and the whole stuff 

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:46.060
 then about 140 euro will be due 

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.750
 Also there is the link below in the video 

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.640
 description 

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:50.890
 So I'm completely convinced of that 

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:53.500
 is really a nice gimmick with 

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:55.300
 great quality and then we are too 

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:57.430
 already arrived at the end I hope that 

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.720
 video you liked if yes it shows 

00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:59.830
 me with a thumbs up or 

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.330
 a comment 

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:03.430
 and then I hope that we join 

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:05.050
 next time, the links will be closed 

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:06.820
 java are also down in the 

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:08.980
 Thanks for the video description 

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:10.450
 provision of the test must be and 

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:13.350
 then I would say until the next 

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:13.350
 times, people are good
