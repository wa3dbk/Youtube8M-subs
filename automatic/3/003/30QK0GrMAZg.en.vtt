00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
the three racks a vs protoss so three

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.440 
the three racks a vs protoss so three
racks<00:00:09.750> is<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:10.019> pretty<00:00:10.500> basic<00:00:10.800> bill<00:00:11.190> and<00:00:11.820> it's

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
really useful in terran vs protoss games

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.849 
really useful in terran vs protoss games
and<00:00:15.000> it's<00:00:15.360> very<00:00:15.690> very<00:00:15.780> powerful<00:00:16.080> actually<00:00:16.619> for

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
and it's very very powerful actually for

masters with this film so let's take a
look<00:00:42.899> at<00:00:42.989> this<00:00:43.079> build<00:00:43.290> first<00:00:43.649> one<00:00:43.950> we're<00:00:44.070> going

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
look at this build first one we're going

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.190 
look at this build first one we're going
to<00:00:44.250> be<00:00:44.430> doing<00:00:44.610> building<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.239> supply<00:00:45.600> depot<00:00:45.629> on

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
to be doing building a supply depot on

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.740 
to be doing building a supply depot on
10<00:00:46.680> supply<00:00:47.430> that's<00:00:47.789> very<00:00:48.030> very<00:00:48.539> critical

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
10 supply that's very very critical

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.900 
10 supply that's very very critical
since<00:00:49.140> that's<00:00:49.379> late<00:00:49.530> now<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.370> don't<00:00:50.610> want<00:00:50.789> to

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
since that's late now you don't want to

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.450 
since that's late now you don't want to
build<00:00:51.719> your<00:00:51.870> supply<00:00:52.199> depot<00:00:52.590> too<00:00:52.649> early<00:00:53.219> since

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
build your supply depot too early since

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.880 
build your supply depot too early since
you<00:00:53.579> will<00:00:53.730> cut<00:00:54.030> SCP<00:00:54.719> production<00:00:55.230> but<00:00:55.800> you

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
you will cut SCP production but you

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.139 
you will cut SCP production but you
don't<00:00:56.070> want<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.250> build<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.550> too<00:00:56.820> late

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
don't want to build it too late

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.029 
don't want to build it too late
otherwise<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.870> will<00:00:57.989> also<00:00:58.199> cut<00:00:58.559> SUV

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
otherwise you will also cut SUV

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.459 
otherwise you will also cut SUV
production<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.760> SE<00:01:00.660> venus<00:01:00.930> they<00:01:01.109> can<00:01:01.289> pay<00:01:01.440> for

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
production and SE venus they can pay for

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.139 
production and SE venus they can pay for
themselves<00:01:01.829> really<00:01:02.430> really<00:01:02.579> quickly<00:01:02.879> so<00:01:03.000> you

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
themselves really really quickly so you

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.299 
themselves really really quickly so you
don't<00:01:03.449> want<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.660> do<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.780> now<00:01:04.500> once<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.159> get

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
don't want to do that now once you get

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.760 
don't want to do that now once you get
to<00:01:05.339> 12<00:01:05.729> supply<00:01:06.060> once<00:01:06.360> your<00:01:06.540> supply<00:01:07.290> depot<00:01:07.590> tis

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
to 12 supply once your supply depot tis

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.770 
to 12 supply once your supply depot tis
done<00:01:08.010> go<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.490> barracks<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:10.070> then<00:01:11.070> after<00:01:11.670> that

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
done go to barracks and then after that

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.390 
done go to barracks and then after that
I'm<00:01:12.780> gonna<00:01:12.960> build<00:01:13.710> another<00:01:13.950> SUV<00:01:14.189> cutting<00:01:14.970> it

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
I'm gonna build another SUV cutting it

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.380 
I'm gonna build another SUV cutting it
short<00:01:16.090> period<00:01:16.540> of<00:01:16.570> time<00:01:16.800> it's<00:01:17.800> fine<00:01:18.150> now<00:01:19.150> I'm

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
short period of time it's fine now I'm

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.720 
short period of time it's fine now I'm
going<00:01:19.540> to<00:01:19.660> get<00:01:19.780> to<00:01:19.900> 75<00:01:20.560> minerals<00:01:20.920> on<00:01:21.040> 13<00:01:21.580> to

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:21.730 
going to get to 75 minerals on 13 to

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.180 
going to get to 75 minerals on 13 to
fight<00:01:21.940> build<00:01:22.300> our<00:01:22.480> refinery<00:01:22.930> and<00:01:23.230> then<00:01:23.620> going

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
fight build our refinery and then going

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.400 
fight build our refinery and then going
to<00:01:24.370> sketch<00:01:24.670> this<00:01:24.880> is<00:01:25.060> shattered<00:01:25.450> temple<00:01:25.840> which

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
to sketch this is shattered temple which

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.080 
to sketch this is shattered temple which
means<00:01:26.680> that<00:01:26.830> we<00:01:26.950> might<00:01:27.310> have<00:01:27.550> the<00:01:27.700> opponent

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
means that we might have the opponent

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.970 
means that we might have the opponent
they<00:01:28.630> closed<00:01:28.900> positions<00:01:29.410> that<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:29.770> first

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:29.980 
they closed positions that the first

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.860 
they closed positions that the first
place<00:01:30.160> that<00:01:30.190> I'm<00:01:30.460> going<00:01:30.610> to<00:01:30.700> check<00:01:30.880> and<00:01:31.210> I've

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:31.870 
place that I'm going to check and I've

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.510 
place that I'm going to check and I've
already<00:01:32.140> spawned<00:01:32.680> knowing<00:01:33.190> that<00:01:33.400> this

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
already spawned knowing that this

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.270 
already spawned knowing that this
opponent<00:01:33.820> as<00:01:34.060> protoss<00:01:34.540> this<00:01:35.320> build<00:01:35.650> is<00:01:35.860> decent

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
opponent as protoss this build is decent

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.390 
opponent as protoss this build is decent
against<00:01:36.760> I<00:01:37.350> guess<00:01:38.350> you<00:01:38.500> can<00:01:38.620> say<00:01:38.830> this<00:01:39.100> build

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
against I guess you can say this build

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.340 
against I guess you can say this build
would<00:01:39.550> be<00:01:39.580> decent<00:01:40.060> against<00:01:40.390> most<00:01:40.720> races<00:01:41.170> into

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
would be decent against most races into

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.370 
would be decent against most races into
lower<00:01:41.710> levels<00:01:42.160> but<00:01:42.640> against<00:01:42.970> in<00:01:43.930> the<00:01:44.200> higher

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
lower levels but against in the higher

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.230 
lower levels but against in the higher
levels<00:01:44.740> it's<00:01:45.010> probably<00:01:45.490> most<00:01:45.820> powerful

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
levels it's probably most powerful

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.060 
levels it's probably most powerful
against<00:01:46.450> protoss<00:01:46.870> now<00:01:47.530> you<00:01:47.590> can<00:01:47.800> see<00:01:47.950> my

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
against protoss now you can see my

here we go second barracks going up as
well<00:02:30.910> looks<00:02:31.540> like<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:31.720> opponent<00:02:32.410> isn't<00:02:32.590> here

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040

at the far base now we're going to get
my<00:02:35.770> concussive<00:02:36.220> shells<00:02:36.610> research<00:02:37.030> started

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
my concussive shells research started

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.590 
my concussive shells research started
and<00:02:39.750> start<00:02:40.750> building<00:02:40.900> a<00:02:41.170> marauder<00:02:41.530> and

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
and start building a marauder and

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.360 
and start building a marauder and
continue<00:02:43.600> building<00:02:44.080> SUVs<00:02:44.740> I'm<00:02:44.950> not<00:02:45.100> even<00:02:45.340> sure

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
continue building SUVs I'm not even sure

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.870 
continue building SUVs I'm not even sure
if<00:02:45.790> you're<00:02:46.090> supposed<00:02:46.420> to<00:02:46.540> keep<00:02:46.690> recipes<00:02:47.880> I

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
if you're supposed to keep recipes I

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.450 
if you're supposed to keep recipes I
don't<00:02:49.810> think<00:02:49.930> this<00:02:50.290> build<00:02:50.620> involves<00:02:51.160> cutting

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
don't think this build involves cutting

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.680 
don't think this build involves cutting
SUVs<00:02:52.120> to<00:02:53.220> not<00:02:54.220> enough<00:02:54.550> minerals<00:02:54.910> going<00:02:55.630> to

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
SUVs to not enough minerals going to

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.690 
SUVs to not enough minerals going to
build<00:02:55.840> my<00:02:55.990> third<00:02:56.320> barracks<00:02:56.950> at<00:02:57.100> the<00:02:57.160> time<00:02:57.520> Oh

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
build my third barracks at the time Oh

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.610 
build my third barracks at the time Oh
looks<00:02:58.090> like<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.660> computers<00:02:59.110> built<00:02:59.380> two

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
looks like the computers built two

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.470 
looks like the computers built two
zealots<00:03:00.010> at<00:03:00.190> the<00:03:00.310> start<00:03:00.610> and<00:03:00.790> then<00:03:00.940> just<00:03:01.210> scout

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
zealots at the start and then just scout

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.750 
zealots at the start and then just scout
around<00:03:01.630> looks<00:03:02.080> like<00:03:02.200> Nestle<00:03:02.680> very<00:03:03.400> little

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
around looks like Nestle very little

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.280 
around looks like Nestle very little
chrono<00:03:04.030> boost<00:03:04.240> so<00:03:04.390> it<00:03:04.600> looks<00:03:04.810> like<00:03:04.870> he's<00:03:05.080> not

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
chrono boost so it looks like he's not

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.110 
chrono boost so it looks like he's not
forgetting<00:03:05.920> he's<00:03:06.430> actually<00:03:06.670> building

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
forgetting he's actually building

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.090 
forgetting he's actually building
something<00:03:07.360> over<00:03:07.720> there<00:03:07.900> I<00:03:08.110> will<00:03:08.770> see<00:03:08.950> what

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
something over there I will see what

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.280 
something over there I will see what
he's<00:03:09.250> up<00:03:09.460> to<00:03:09.700> continue<00:03:10.570> building<00:03:10.780> supply

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
he's up to continue building supply

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.260 
he's up to continue building supply
depots<00:03:11.680> right<00:03:11.980> over<00:03:12.190> here<00:03:12.430> to<00:03:12.760> make<00:03:12.910> sure<00:03:13.090> that

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
depots right over here to make sure that

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.960 
depots right over here to make sure that
we<00:03:13.390> do<00:03:13.750> not<00:03:14.140> get<00:03:14.500> supply<00:03:14.860> block<00:03:15.130> and<00:03:15.400> it<00:03:15.790> looks

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
we do not get supply block and it looks

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.610 
we do not get supply block and it looks
like<00:03:16.030> I<00:03:16.210> just<00:03:16.270> died<00:03:16.630> not<00:03:17.110> knowing<00:03:17.170> what<00:03:17.590> that

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
like I just died not knowing what that

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.730 
like I just died not knowing what that
building<00:03:18.130> was<00:03:19.410> complete<00:03:21.900> okay<00:03:22.900> so<00:03:22.960> now<00:03:23.530> I<00:03:23.560> just

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:23.740 
building was complete okay so now I just

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.130 
building was complete okay so now I just
got<00:03:24.130> that<00:03:24.280> research<00:03:24.700> done<00:03:25.000> and<00:03:25.240> I'm<00:03:25.870> going<00:03:26.110> to

research stem as soon as I have enough
money<00:03:28.510> for<00:03:28.630> it<00:03:28.900> which<00:03:29.080> should<00:03:29.260> be<00:03:29.410> very<00:03:29.650> very

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:29.740 
money for it which should be very very

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.490 
money for it which should be very very
soon<00:03:30.160> there<00:03:30.550> we<00:03:30.670> go<00:03:30.820> stim<00:03:31.420> going<00:03:31.780> down<00:03:31.960> get

supply depot that might have been

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.080 
supply depot that might have been
slightly<00:03:49.180> early<00:03:49.620> but<00:03:50.620> here<00:03:50.770> we<00:03:50.860> go<00:03:50.980> so<00:03:51.880> now

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
slightly early but here we go so now

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.850 
slightly early but here we go so now
what<00:03:52.630> we're<00:03:52.810> getting<00:03:52.900> to<00:03:53.170> is<00:03:53.380> we're<00:03:53.620> getting

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
what we're getting to is we're getting

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.210 
what we're getting to is we're getting
to<00:03:53.980> three<00:03:54.610> barracks<00:03:54.940> with<00:03:55.660> two<00:03:56.260> techlabs<00:03:56.920> and

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
to three barracks with two techlabs and

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.820 
to three barracks with two techlabs and
one<00:03:57.550> reactor<00:03:58.150> and<00:03:58.360> this<00:03:58.630> is<00:03:59.350> going<00:03:59.560> to<00:03:59.650> be<00:03:59.709> very

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
one reactor and this is going to be very

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.100 
one reactor and this is going to be very
powerful<00:04:00.070> so<00:04:00.459> keep<00:04:01.120> on<00:04:01.240> building<00:04:01.420> units<00:04:01.840> be

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
powerful so keep on building units be

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.870 
powerful so keep on building units be
sure<00:04:02.290> to<00:04:02.530> continuously<00:04:03.190> produce<00:04:03.370> units

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
sure to continuously produce units

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.880 
sure to continuously produce units
without<00:04:04.000> queuing<00:04:04.480> up<00:04:04.570> one<00:04:04.870> Marauder<00:04:05.260> here<00:04:05.560> two

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
without queuing up one Marauder here two

without queuing up one Marauder here two
Marines<00:04:06.250> here<00:04:06.459> and<00:04:06.870> once<00:04:07.870> we<00:04:08.050> get<00:04:08.230> that<00:04:08.470> I

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
Marines here and once we get that I

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.920 
Marines here and once we get that I
think<00:04:09.370> I<00:04:09.430> can<00:04:09.610> cut<00:04:09.790> SUV<00:04:10.270> production<00:04:10.750> right<00:04:10.900> now

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
think I can cut SUV production right now

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.290 
think I can cut SUV production right now
as<00:04:11.200> well<00:04:11.530> continue<00:04:12.070> building<00:04:12.490> supply<00:04:12.940> depots

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
as well continue building supply depots

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.010 
as well continue building supply depots
and<00:04:13.540> now<00:04:14.130> once<00:04:15.130> stim<00:04:15.550> gets<00:04:16.150> nearly<00:04:16.480> finished<00:04:16.900> I

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:17.020 
and now once stim gets nearly finished I

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:21.440 
and now once stim gets nearly finished I
move<00:04:17.350> in<00:04:17.590> for<00:04:17.950> up<00:04:18.190> crush<00:04:18.520> so<00:04:19.180> we<00:04:19.570> go<00:04:19.890> d-e-a-d

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
move in for up crush so we go d-e-a-d

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.660 
move in for up crush so we go d-e-a-d
not<00:04:22.450> enough

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
not enough

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.840 
not enough
not<00:04:24.670> enough<00:04:24.970> minerals<00:04:26.100> but<00:04:27.100> making<00:04:27.580> sure<00:04:27.610> that

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
not enough minerals but making sure that

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.760 
not enough minerals but making sure that
all<00:04:27.970> of<00:04:28.000> my<00:04:28.180> barracks<00:04:28.450> are<00:04:28.570> producing<00:04:28.990> and<00:04:29.170> I

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
all of my barracks are producing and I

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.430 
all of my barracks are producing and I
have<00:04:29.980> one<00:04:30.190> unit<00:04:30.490> cued<00:04:30.760> up<00:04:30.820> over<00:04:31.150> here<00:04:31.330> but<00:04:31.540> you

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
have one unit cued up over here but you

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.380 
have one unit cued up over here but you
can<00:04:32.590> see<00:04:32.770> that<00:04:32.980> it's<00:04:33.730> because<00:04:34.030> the<00:04:34.060> other

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
can see that it's because the other

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:39.240 
can see that it's because the other
units<00:04:34.780> were<00:04:34.900> about<00:04:35.110> to<00:04:35.320> finish<00:04:35.500> so<00:04:36.280> daa<00:04:38.250> keep

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
units were about to finish so daa keep

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.960 
units were about to finish so daa keep
on<00:04:39.400> building<00:04:39.580> supply<00:04:40.060> decodes<00:04:40.860> and<00:04:41.970> another

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
on building supply decodes and another

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:49.810 
on building supply decodes and another
over<00:04:44.370> soon<00:04:45.370> d

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.050 

and<00:04:49.940> Stan<00:04:50.980> looks<00:04:51.980> like<00:04:52.130> there's<00:04:52.340> another<00:04:52.430> 50

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
and Stan looks like there's another 50

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.000 
and Stan looks like there's another 50
seconds<00:04:53.540> so<00:04:53.780> we<00:04:53.900> can<00:04:54.050> move<00:04:54.140> out<00:04:54.350> after<00:04:54.770> another

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
seconds so we can move out after another

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:02.610 
seconds so we can move out after another
round<00:04:55.220> of<00:04:55.340> production<00:04:56.050> d<00:04:57.050> ka

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.680 

and<00:05:02.919> continue<00:05:03.520> building<00:05:03.729> this<00:05:03.970> in<00:05:04.150> multiples

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
and continue building this in multiples

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.250 
and continue building this in multiples
stem<00:05:05.620> nearly<00:05:06.130> done<00:05:06.280> I<00:05:06.880> think<00:05:07.870> once<00:05:08.110> this

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
stem nearly done I think once this

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.990 
stem nearly done I think once this
production<00:05:08.740> cycle<00:05:09.070> finishes<00:05:09.490> I<00:05:09.610> should<00:05:09.880> be

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
production cycle finishes I should be

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.460 
production cycle finishes I should be
able<00:05:10.060> to<00:05:10.270> move<00:05:10.389> in<00:05:10.540> and<00:05:10.660> you<00:05:10.870> can<00:05:10.990> see<00:05:11.169> I<00:05:11.199> have<00:05:11.290> a

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
able to move in and you can see I have a

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:12.600 
able to move in and you can see I have a
decent<00:05:11.710> number<00:05:11.949> of<00:05:12.100> marines<00:05:12.400> and<00:05:12.550> marauders

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
decent number of marines and marauders

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:19.830 
decent number of marines and marauders
right<00:05:13.060> now<00:05:17.639> okay<00:05:18.639> here<00:05:18.850> we<00:05:18.940> go<00:05:18.970> oh<00:05:19.270> it<00:05:19.660> looks

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
right now okay here we go oh it looks

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.020 
right now okay here we go oh it looks
like<00:05:20.020> he's<00:05:20.169> moving<00:05:20.530> in<00:05:20.590> court<00:05:20.889> Bush<00:05:21.100> will<00:05:21.910> be

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
like he's moving in court Bush will be

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.120 
like he's moving in court Bush will be
actually<00:05:22.180> even<00:05:22.660> better<00:05:22.690> for<00:05:23.050> me<00:05:23.199> I'm<00:05:23.440> going<00:05:24.070> to

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
actually even better for me I'm going to

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.400 
actually even better for me I'm going to
chase<00:05:24.340> back<00:05:24.580> his<00:05:24.790> units<00:05:25.120> and<00:05:25.300> it<00:05:25.990> looks<00:05:26.169> like<00:05:26.229> i

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
chase back his units and it looks like i

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.260 
chase back his units and it looks like i
have<00:05:26.440> about<00:05:26.919> enough<00:05:27.280> minerals<00:05:27.520> to<00:05:27.820> go<00:05:27.970> for<00:05:28.210> an

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
have about enough minerals to go for an

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:39.770 
have about enough minerals to go for an
expansion<00:05:28.690> right<00:05:28.960> now<00:05:29.110> as<00:05:29.260> well<00:05:38.250> so<00:05:39.250> now

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
expansion right now as well so now

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.540 
expansion right now as well so now
basically<00:05:40.780> we<00:05:41.199> can<00:05:41.350> almost<00:05:41.500> a<00:05:41.770> move<00:05:42.100> into<00:05:42.460> his

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
basically we can almost a move into his

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.320 
basically we can almost a move into his
face<00:05:42.820> Wiz<00:05:43.539> we<00:05:44.380> have<00:05:44.530> stem<00:05:44.889> and<00:05:45.070> sim<00:05:45.430> is<00:05:45.669> just

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 
face Wiz we have stem and sim is just

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.120 
face Wiz we have stem and sim is just
exceptionally<00:05:47.229> powerful<00:05:47.410> and<00:05:47.740> you<00:05:47.860> can<00:05:47.979> see

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
exceptionally powerful and you can see

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.250 
exceptionally powerful and you can see
right<00:05:48.160> now<00:05:48.310> my<00:05:49.060> Protoss<00:05:49.449> opponent<00:05:49.900> is<00:05:50.020> just

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:50.260 
right now my Protoss opponent is just

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.920 
right now my Protoss opponent is just
one<00:05:50.500> basing<00:05:51.060> might<00:05:52.060> have<00:05:52.240> a<00:05:52.270> century<00:05:52.690> over

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
one basing might have a century over

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.800 
one basing might have a century over
here<00:05:53.110> to<00:05:53.260> force<00:05:53.590> the<00:05:53.770> other<00:05:53.949> ramp<00:05:54.220> but<00:05:55.030> look<00:05:55.690> at

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.810 
here to force the other ramp but look at

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.200 
here to force the other ramp but look at
this<00:05:55.930> we<00:05:56.139> just<00:05:56.350> have<00:05:56.470> more<00:05:56.889> units<00:05:57.520> than<00:05:57.610> my

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
this we just have more units than my

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.080 
this we just have more units than my
opponent

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090 
opponent

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.960

I was playing against a computer player

medium<00:06:41.880> difficulty<00:06:42.360> was<00:06:42.690> not<00:06:42.990> too<00:06:43.320> difficult

medium difficulty was not too difficult

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:48.379 
medium difficulty was not too difficult
but<00:06:46.370> it's<00:06:47.370> definitely<00:06:47.639> a<00:06:47.850> very<00:06:47.880> powerful

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:48.389
