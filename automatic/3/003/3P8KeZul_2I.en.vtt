00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.910
 moment of grave weakness that the United States are going through for the 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.040
 badly 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.530
 on this background outlined by the wise penis of John Milius remove 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.560
 you in the role of robert that is cox a helicopter pilot

 hibernate as an important element of resistance accompanied others 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.720
 improvised soldiers like you try to restore hope to a people 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.730
 too much for me was to hope for the partisan struggle 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.200
 without star web other the plot the time you reach the credits compare 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.000
 revealed an excellent era was designed thanks to the attention to detail 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.170
 really noteworthy and that does not fear to dine very bad moments but unfortunately 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.180
 does not express all its potential, limiting itself to telling you I find little 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.570
 stimulating populated by characters stereotyped by the poor charisma 

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:26.879
 fortunately the same setting has been exploited in a much greater way 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.069
 profitable from the point of view of pure templars 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.629
 Game envoy is the most classic thing you can think of absolutely 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:36.140
 linear and rich in script sequences, capable of giving moments from above 

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:37.280
 adrenaline rate 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.670
 the experience comes closer to what we saw being born with beauty but not 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.899
 there will be no influences derived from other exponents of the genus 

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:46.879
 the greatest asset of ohm's single-player campaign is you are 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:50.549
 in the excellent orchestrations beautiful rhythm of game capable of remarkable spades without 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.999
 for this reason, neglecting more relaxing moments 5 you can turn 

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:56.649
 for settings to interact with non-characters 

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:59.729
 tt carpi nourish the nuances of the game environment 

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:03.370
 there is no shortage of sections on the border of vehicles but we prefer 

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:06.599
 entering too much in detail so as not to spoil the pleasure of playing everything dun 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.229
 breath the single mode 

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:11.499
 in over 20 situations you will have the possibility to check colin firth 

00:03:11.499 --> 00:03:15.439

 use to signal take that to be liminated 

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:21.590
 thanks also to the shortness of the campaign around 5 am I have the medium difficulty 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.569
 to visit events ban from glued to the screen from the beginning to 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:25.100
 end 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.569
 in other words, mansi is bored, by attracting that which devours appetite to the end 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.439
 unfortunately this reveals too soon for the lack of freedom 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:34.599
 decision-making granted player will have time that incentives to repeat 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:37.729
 experience 

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:41.189
 despite the single player offer has proved very solid and capable 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:44.599
 to give hours of fun these will inevitably run out in short 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:45.359
 time 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:48.859
 comparison fortunately also offers the complete multiplayer component 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:50.569
 great potential 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.079
 mode offers are two grown-up team controlled deathmatches 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.829

 kind of kent she could be pampered with viber company 2 by virtue 

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:02.120
 of a rather reasoned pace of play

 imap and with very generous dimensions and the presence of winds 

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:08.949

 forgive a person's own title 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.559
 absolutely excellent also the number of revised effects 

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:30.349
 explosive bullets and anything else that will fill the screen 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:32.789
 photo we are to make a praise to the work of the graphic designers

 with complements always adequate as well as dubbing in Italian 

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:41.410
 more than satisfactory result 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.410
 beat only for cradles perfection the synchrony 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.909
 I'm listening 

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:48.520
 I'm working on it 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.520
 Pink night 

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:58.020
 unfortunately the music that they will accompany is not very inspired 

00:05:58.019 --> 00:06:01.169
 where the excellent work done in the aesthetic sector gets deserved now 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:04.169
 soundtrack of quite another thickness 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:07.339
 Well

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.599
 not how much they are worth meditating 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:21.879
 the single player campaigns that will give hours of fun but 

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:25.419
 unfortunately a few and it was a narrative rompetrol that would have been so nice 

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:28.360
