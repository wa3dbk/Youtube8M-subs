00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.820 
it's um the virus or not and if the
results<00:02:27.000> are<00:02:27.240> just<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.810> -<00:02:28.050> that<00:02:28.380> means<00:02:28.620> it's

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
results are just the - that means it's

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.570 
results are just the - that means it's
now<00:02:29.010> virus<00:02:29.520> and<00:02:29.870> if<00:02:30.870> there's<00:02:31.500> more<00:02:31.560> non<00:02:31.980> virus

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
now virus and if there's more non virus

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.630 
now virus and if there's more non virus
things<00:02:33.000> than<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.780> virus<00:02:34.320> then<00:02:34.860> obviously<00:02:35.100> it's

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
things than a virus then obviously it's

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.180 
things than a virus then obviously it's
most<00:02:36.270> likely<00:02:36.420> not<00:02:37.170> a<00:02:37.230> virus

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190
