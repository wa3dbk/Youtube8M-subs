00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.770
 hello people here on the channel will 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.960
 reloaded speaks here with max and me 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.970
 I have another top 5 for you 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.980
 time is it rotates about the top 5 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.720
 SchwertkÃ¤mpfer and I want it too 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.869
 say that's my personal opinion 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.670
 So up to my top 5 sword fighters 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.080
 not now ranked by more 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.300
 or so yes I wanted that earlier 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.890
 say and that again soon 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.960
 podcast follows but at the moment it is 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.180
 It is quite difficult since there was already 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.379
 in the last video of Portugal what 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.270
 that he is not so active at the moment 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:47.500
 That's why it takes a while 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.610
 and that's why I 'm making another one 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.280
 top 5 list 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.800
 so we start with place five that is 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.420
 at my flowers sword vista he was 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.610
 or is the commander of the 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.790
 fifth division of the lead band 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.680
 He is a very strong fighter with it 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.989
 two swords fought and he could 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.940
 also communicate eye on marine ford 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.860
 measure as he could keep up with him 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.780
 of course also has hp and he has 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.369
 his nickname flowers through 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.780
 I get his combat style was still 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:15.700
 I also think that's pretty good 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.440
 funny above all with a grin 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.240
 and I like that pretty much 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.909
 That's why he's with me 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.890
 at number 5, place four goes to the office of 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:26.110
 is a member of the stroth piratenbande 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.479
 and monotonous still pretty 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.310
 mysterious character what his strength 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.920
 When I think that is still 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.960
 pretty strong that we still have some of it 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.460
 Bruck see but in itself is also a 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.740
 strong sword fighter alone 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.770
 his attack like for example source 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.229
 Holle is pretty strong at and 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.509
 Also with me is to place four 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.759
 alone to even less sympathy point 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.430
 because I just think it's so funny 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:54.330
 so broadway it right with itself so 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.560
 Place three goes to me has falkenauge 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.330
 At the moment he is considered the best 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.090
 swordsman of the world dubbed and 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.430
 Of course not so wrong heart 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.189
 is often his strength also proved 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.990
 a pretty much both that is 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.600
 never really impressed 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.610
 besides, the black thought you had with 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.010
 which he can handle very well and it 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.780
 just make him too strong 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.710
 remembers the beginning as you 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.110
 just at sun ti was 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.000
 as he finished with a through 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.260
 did and I think new york too 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.140
 pretty cool that's why 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.160
 place three place two is net with me 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.650
 thought to rest 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.360
 this is a place of new york for me 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.340
 first because you do not now have a 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.230
 full strength seen okay with me too 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.600
 not but I think he just has 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.520
 more potential in itself than falcon eye 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.440
 besides, I think so too 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.480
 defeat falcon eye that's just one 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.360
 further indication that he on the one hand 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.890
 etc, an amplifier 2 is spotted exactly 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.460
 And now, I will definitely 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.410
 his 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.650
 Also I celebrate just say one 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.840
 piece more than falcon that is just like that 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.550
 and that's why but in 2 and now 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.890
 we come to number one my absolute 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.270
 favorite character though in this too 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.100
 list and i fear my 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.860
 favorite character so something else 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.200
 Expects it is the red he gives 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.240
 one of the emperors and he thinks 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.160
 me that most violently the hak i was that 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.960
 once the fiercest ag we ever had 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.060
 see I will believe that is correct 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.580
 be strong with that but that's the point 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.680
 Also not in the list co2 thing and 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.540
 Of course, it is also a very strong one 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.510
 Shooter he has been more often 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.250
 measured with me as gives his arm 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.630
 had lost it seems it was 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.670
 always balanced 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.470
 In addition , the marine ford stops with 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.480
 his sword just times the attack 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.010
 from aquin and that's something you have to do 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.010
 It was always admiral 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.590
 network gives away no problem and 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.320
 All in all, it's just awesome 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.210
 jam around it my favorite work klemm 92 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.980
 on my favorite character in one piece 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.650
 and I would say it if it were you 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.270
 We liked the rating because we write 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.220
 your opinion in the comments 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.810
 subscribed and secondly not yet 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.910
 I would have subscribed then 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.520
 Let's see you at the next video 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:05.530
 soon follows a podcast and then 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.530
 I would say goodbye
