guitar those are sort of the the two
classes<00:00:42.480> that<00:00:42.570> we<00:00:42.690> divide<00:00:42.930> things<00:00:43.140> up<00:00:43.290> into

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
classes that we divide things up into

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.139 
classes that we divide things up into
with<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.829> guitar<00:00:44.129> it's<00:00:44.309> like<00:00:44.460> dreadnought<00:00:44.940> or

difference<00:01:21.060> when<00:01:21.390> we<00:01:21.479> play<00:01:21.630> some<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:21.869> these

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
difference when we play some of these

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.620 
difference when we play some of these
here<00:01:22.229> this<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:22.860> an<00:01:22.979> e<00:01:23.159> knock<00:01:23.340> open<00:01:23.820> back<00:01:24.180> banjo

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
here this is an e knock open back banjo

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.969

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
and if you look really closely at the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.819 
and if you look really closely at the
rim<00:01:26.220> here<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:27.330> can<00:01:27.509> see<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.229> skin<00:01:28.500> just

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
rim here you can see that the skin just

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.010 
rim here you can see that the skin just
goes<00:01:28.979> right<00:01:29.310> over<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.790> top<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.240> wood<00:01:33.020> and

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
goes right over the top of the wood and

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.770 
goes right over the top of the wood and
you<00:01:34.079> can<00:01:34.290> actually<00:01:34.439> look<00:01:34.740> in<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.670> back<00:01:35.880> see

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
you can actually look in the back see

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.210 
you can actually look in the back see
the<00:01:36.900> same<00:01:37.110> thing<00:01:37.350> it's<00:01:37.650> just<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.009> wood

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
the same thing it's just the wood

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.840 
the same thing it's just the wood
touching<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.729> skin<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.470> then<00:01:40.470> as<00:01:41.400> that

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
touching the skin and then as that

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.310 
touching the skin and then as that
wasn't<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.630> know<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:42.869> wasn't<00:01:43.170> loud<00:01:43.259> enough

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
wasn't you know that wasn't loud enough

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.200 
wasn't you know that wasn't loud enough
so<00:01:43.950> they<00:01:44.100> sort<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.399> moved<00:01:44.610> on<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:44.970> then<00:01:45.090> they

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
so they sort of moved on and then they

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.789 
so they sort of moved on and then they
started<00:01:45.750> putting<00:01:45.840> things<00:01:46.170> called<00:01:46.350> tone<00:01:46.560> rings

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
started putting things called tone rings

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.920 
started putting things called tone rings
in<00:01:46.950> banjos<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.640> originally<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.329> was<00:01:48.479> just<00:01:48.720> a

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
in banjos and originally it was just a

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.990 
in banjos and originally it was just a
ring<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.649> brass<00:01:49.890> ring<00:01:50.130> or<00:01:50.310> some<00:01:50.490> kind<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.729> metal

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
ring a brass ring or some kind of metal

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.690 
ring a brass ring or some kind of metal
ring<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.420> went<00:01:51.600> around<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.590> inside<00:01:53.189> where

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
ring that went around the inside where
