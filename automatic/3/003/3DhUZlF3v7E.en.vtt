00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:27.480
 and that way 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.480
 for example styling due to a dispute the board 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:33.050
 it's the most important thing 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.720
 with the nuisance the budget I had to submit against the ball to book as 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.170
 we must continue to grow 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.310
 otherwise you stand still 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.310
 stagnation is the decline 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.430
 anp if you go back then 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.840
 bossi clothing 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.450

 everyone must do their bit to everyone 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.949
 the enterprise 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:01.940
 except everyone looks 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.030
 because if they have to do their bit almost his bit fast 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.990
 cars 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.610
 we must be grateful to him 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.210

 for those who cannot leave here 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.600
 made the savings 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.600
 intended to safeguard the economy 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.630
 It is often said that they proved the banking crisis to be economical 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.640
 did not understand the economy 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.680
 open without not being able to move the economy further 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.430
 we still have to drop them alpe d'huzes 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.040

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.040

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:18.450
 strikes are caused by people on the strike at nicam 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:23.309
