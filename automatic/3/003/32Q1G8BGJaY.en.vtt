00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.770
 I'm placing handles in our 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.260
 furniture but look, I left this 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.529
 door ready for you to see it with 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.330
 clarity but I have started to realize 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.539
 the brands where I have to do the 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.480
 drills the first thing we're going to do is 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.570
 choose a bit that is something bigger 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.960
 diameter 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:42.160
 that the same screw that we are going to assemble 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:46.309
 once you have the drill already assembled 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.500
 we can drill that, but look carefully 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.809
 this detail whenever we make a 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.360
 Drill on the wood when the drill bit 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.519
 out can chipping the whole area by 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.559
 where will show degrees to avoid it is 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:01.239
 something as simple as putting a martyr 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.239
 on the other side of the board 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.390
 we put there and hold well 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.800
 in this way the bit instead of going out 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.460
 will continue with the drill 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.460
 you go 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:31.719
 If you see no decontrol the 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:36.679
 work has been in conditions 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:39.380
 finally we take the screws the 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:42.920
 shooter and a manual screwdriver for 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.369
 fix it we're going to pass a screw through 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.369
 each drill 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:52.170
 and on this side 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.890
 we aim it we aim first one and 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.890
 then the other 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.390
 and we can screw it 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.600
 there 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.600
 and what 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.600
 ah 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:21.260
 Well you see a simple job but 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:21.260
 which gives very good results
