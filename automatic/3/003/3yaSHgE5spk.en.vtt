00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
thought that this piece this crossbar

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.230 
thought that this piece this crossbar
piece<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.650> spoiler<00:00:26.070> piece<00:00:26.539> was<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:29.240> wind

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
piece the spoiler piece was the wind

came back from toys r us three dollar
fifty<00:00:44.180> and<00:00:45.180> i<00:00:45.450> try<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.899> feel<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.140> I<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.800> know

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
fifty and i try to feel that I you know

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.729 
fifty and i try to feel that I you know
what<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.250> knew<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.180> had<00:00:48.329> fuselage<00:00:49.020> in<00:00:49.379> one<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.590> the

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
what I knew I had fuselage in one of the

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.610 
what I knew I had fuselage in one of the
packets<00:00:50.160> but<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:50.820> thought<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.660> already<00:00:51.870> had<00:00:52.170> him

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
packets but I thought I already had him

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.340 
packets but I thought I already had him
so<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.100> i<00:00:53.579> said<00:00:53.940> no<00:00:54.149> i<00:00:54.239> don't<00:00:54.660> need<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:54.930> because<00:00:55.140> i

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
so I i said no i don't need it because i

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.049 
so I i said no i don't need it because i
already<00:00:55.860> have<00:00:56.190> one<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:58.309> threw<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.430> away<00:00:59.520> and

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
already have one so I threw it away and

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.180 
already have one so I threw it away and
put<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.300> back<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.660> pile<00:01:00.840> but<00:01:01.109> should<00:01:02.070> have

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
put it back in the pile but should have

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.160 
put it back in the pile but should have
gotten<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.699> because<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.090> felt<00:01:03.329> ugly<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.870> felt

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
gotten it because I felt ugly I felt

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.450 
gotten it because I felt ugly I felt
away<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:05.250> hopefully<00:01:06.060> this<00:01:06.659> one<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.460> the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
away and hopefully this one is the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.070 
away and hopefully this one is the
fuselage<00:01:09.119> figure<00:01:09.840> we're<00:01:10.020> looking<00:01:10.320> for<00:01:10.590> and

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
fuselage figure we're looking for and

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.179 
fuselage figure we're looking for and
yes<00:01:13.080> there<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.860> go<00:01:13.920> fuselage<00:01:15.259> and<00:01:16.259> three

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
yes there you go fuselage and three

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.929 
yes there you go fuselage and three
hours<00:01:17.750> but<00:01:18.750> ok<00:01:19.619> so<00:01:20.100> there<00:01:20.340> I'll<00:01:20.490> probably<00:01:20.729> just

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
hours but ok so there I'll probably just

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.649 
hours but ok so there I'll probably just
end<00:01:21.180> up<00:01:21.330> selling<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:21.900> one<00:01:22.729> you<00:01:23.729> know<00:01:23.850> so

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
end up selling this one you know so

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.330 
end up selling this one you know so
there<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.960> go<00:01:24.990> folks<00:01:25.320> that's<00:01:25.979> my<00:01:26.159> little

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
there you go folks that's my little

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.030 
there you go folks that's my little
unwrapping<00:01:26.820> video<00:01:27.630> for<00:01:28.229> all<00:01:28.380> 12<00:01:28.710> I'll<00:01:28.860> do

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
unwrapping video for all 12 I'll do

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.219 
unwrapping video for all 12 I'll do
review<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:29.909> them<00:01:30.030> maybe<00:01:30.659> just<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.110> quick

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
review and them maybe just a quick

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.859 
review and them maybe just a quick
review<00:01:31.439> just<00:01:31.920> give<00:01:32.250> tips<00:01:32.490> on<00:01:32.670> how<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.630> feel

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
review just give tips on how to to feel

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.440 
review just give tips on how to to feel
up<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.320> user<00:01:34.680> fingers<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.189> feel<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:36.000> pieces

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
up the user fingers and feel the pieces

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.580 
up the user fingers and feel the pieces
and<00:01:37.369> i'll<00:01:38.369> probably<00:01:38.850> do<00:01:39.590> transformations

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
and i'll probably do transformations

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.429 
and i'll probably do transformations
only<00:01:41.280> for<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.610> new<00:01:41.759> ones<00:01:42.000> like<00:01:42.439> black

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
only for the new ones like black

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.149 
only for the new ones like black
Arachnia<00:01:43.890> skimmer<00:01:44.630> scale<00:01:45.630> over<00:01:46.159> everybody

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
Arachnia skimmer scale over everybody

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.999 
Arachnia skimmer scale over everybody
else<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.610> just<00:01:47.850> too<00:01:48.299> old<00:01:48.720> oh<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.740> one's

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
else is just too old oh this one's

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.100 
else is just too old oh this one's
taurus<00:01:50.490> or<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:51.000> old<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.540> sea<00:01:51.689> spray<00:01:51.930> it<00:01:51.990> may

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
taurus or the old and sea spray it may

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.380 
taurus or the old and sea spray it may
be<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.860> sea<00:01:53.070> spray<00:01:53.369> be<00:01:53.549> just<00:01:53.820> these<00:01:53.939> four

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
be so sea spray be just these four

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.940 
be so sea spray be just these four
figures<00:01:54.659> will<00:01:54.990> probably<00:01:55.229> do<00:01:55.320> transformations

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
figures will probably do transformations

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.789 
figures will probably do transformations
but<00:01:56.450> everybody<00:01:57.450> else<00:01:57.509> same<00:01:58.350> transformation

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
but everybody else same transformation

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.620 
but everybody else same transformation
will<00:01:59.219> do<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.930> hopefully<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:00.960> quick<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.770> short<00:02:02.340> view

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
will do a hopefully a quick a short view

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.760 
will do a hopefully a quick a short view
there<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.719> go<00:02:03.810> folks<00:02:03.990> hope<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.380> enjoyed<00:02:04.619> it

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
there you go folks hope you enjoyed it

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.700 
there you go folks hope you enjoyed it
