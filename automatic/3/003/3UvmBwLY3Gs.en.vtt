00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.019
 his thought 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:34.270
 around the theory of yin and of the

 yang and in this video

 I will be very happy to help you in 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.510
 Chinese medicine as in philosophy 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:01.630
 Taoist as well as describing what 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:04.390
 yin and yang e exist in nature 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:08.049
 they perfectly describe all the parts 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:11.890
 and the functions of the body the yin and the yang 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:14.170
 they are two forces in a constant search 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.359
 of balance 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.270
 each of these forces needs 

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:22.179
 of the other to exist and their sum 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.680
 it generates life and allows it 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:27.230
 continuity 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.060
 they are forces and express themselves through the 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.550
 movement 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.420
 I make you an example for him is 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:38.240
 blood yang the vital energy 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.610
 called c the needs blood 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.730
 to nourish the body and blood has 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:47.390
 need c to be moved into 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:49.040
 all areas c 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.320
 the vital energy we are made of 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.220
 travels throughout our body in 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:58.160
 some channels called meridians these 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.380
 channels are separated from the paths of the 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.410
 our nervous system 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.670
 vascular and lymphatic system thinks 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:09.979
 to vital energy as to a fuel 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:13.580
 when we are born we start ours 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:17.959
 travel with a full tank and when 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.550
 the empty tank simply we die 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.640
 according to Chinese medicine this 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.520
 energy fuel tank is 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.739
 contained within the two organs 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.840
 called the kidneys and is distributed in 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:33.010
 our whole body through gods 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:36.910
 channels that are called meridians 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:39.620
 every part of your body and bone organs 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.330
 even your cells are made of 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.790
 power 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.709
 indeed of the two primordial energies that 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:51.320
 allow life thanks to them 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:54.590
 relationship in equilibrium as in 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:57.410
 cells in organs and bones these 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.220
 two forces also exist in the whole 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.810
 body yin and yang act 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.330
 constantly with only one 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.290
 objective to maintain a constant 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:11.720
 balance between them 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:15.620
 this makes your body a system 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:18.019
 called holistic in other words is not 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.810
 possible according to Chinese medicine 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:23.390
 think of an organ or part of the 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.180
 body as an isolated problem without 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.489
 consider the whole body system 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.099
 that supports it 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.720
 ok but at this point what could he have 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.430
 what to do with the pain 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.220
 back 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.340
 Follow me one more minute and I'll explain 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.340
 better 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:47.780
 the kidneys and back pain the back is 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.640
 called the house of the kidneys 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.010
 in the sense that the lower part of the 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.409
 back and more tightly tied but not 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.870
 exclusively to the health of the system 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:58.909
 renal 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.780
 how many times you had back pain and you have 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:04.189
 said I have kidney pain 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.829
 here according to the principles of medicine 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:08.989
 Chinese in case of back pain of 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:12.489
 Normally we begin to treat energy 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:15.829
 of the kidney you remember the yin and the yang 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:19.729
 we talked about the movement forces 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:22.910
 here the forces create energy 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:24.169
 energy is called c returning to 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.050
 talk about c 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:29.030
 in Chinese medicine it is said in the case of 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.910
 free flow there is no pain 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.740
 if there is no free flow there is the 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.930
 ache 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.419
 this means that if the c stagnates 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:42.470
 within the kidney canal there will be 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:45.770
 of pain he imagines a river flowing 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:48.409
 without obstacles and suddenly falls 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.419
 a tree across the river that 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:53.580
 what would happen 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:55.770
 the water will not flow freely but 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:59.880
 will be blocked and must necessarily 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:03.630
 that is flowing on the banks of the river 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.940
 the moment of acute pain the concept 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.310
 basic of Chinese medicine is that 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.130
 to reopen the river create a 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:16.050
 energy circulation so that the 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:17.729
 normal flow is restored to what 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.250
 are the factors that according to medicine 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:23.550
 Chinese can hinder the free 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:27.110
 flow of xix and body blood in 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.110
 so as to cause pain 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:34.350
 an external invasion of wind chill 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:38.610
 of humidity or heat can invade 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:42.570
 the lumbar region causing pain 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:45.419
 if our defensive or the system 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:50.010
 immune is weak you become more 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:54.050
 susceptible to external invasions the 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:57.840
 food to stagnate due to trauma 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:06:00.270
 there may be a lack of co 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.090
 blood that creates a slowness or a 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:07.490
 stagnation of the flow of channels this 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:11.280
 may result from poor diet 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:15.570
 insufficient rest excessive activity 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:16.820
 sexual excess work diseases 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:20.440
 chronic 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:24.410
 excess of negative emotions fear anxiety 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:26.920
 something like anger pain and 

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.920
 aging 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:35.320
 what are the factors that can 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:37.790
 restore the regular flow of c 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:42.050
 well of this topic we will talk about it 

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:45.920
