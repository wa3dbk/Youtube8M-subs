00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
instrument came all of it people

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.880 
instrument came all of it people
actually<00:01:07.759> spoke<00:01:09.970> so<00:01:10.990> 99%<00:01:11.990> to<00:01:12.259> the<00:01:12.440> violins<00:01:12.770> you

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
actually spoke so 99% to the violins you

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.219 
actually spoke so 99% to the violins you
make<00:01:13.070> a<00:01:13.280> binary<00:01:13.670> model<00:01:13.940> how<00:01:14.869> come<00:01:15.020> you<00:01:15.110> don't

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
make a binary model how come you don't

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.050 
make a binary model how come you don't
mix<00:01:15.409> chemicals<00:01:15.619> why<00:01:16.460> do<00:01:16.520> you<00:01:16.670> like<00:01:16.850> white

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
mix chemicals why do you like white

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.640 
mix chemicals why do you like white
noise<00:01:17.320> I<00:01:18.760> prefer<00:01:19.930> it<00:01:20.930> to<00:01:20.960> be<00:01:21.049> for<00:01:21.320> maximum

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
noise I prefer it to be for maximum

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:21.940 
noise I prefer it to be for maximum

I<00:01:22.310> like<00:01:22.850> this<00:01:23.140> imperfection<00:01:24.140> of<00:01:24.409> the<00:01:24.920> shape

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
I like this imperfection of the shape

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.160 
I like this imperfection of the shape
that<00:01:25.670> things<00:01:26.450> are<00:01:26.720> just<00:01:26.900> not<00:01:28.479> not<00:01:29.479> symmetrical

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
that things are just not not symmetrical

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.359 
that things are just not not symmetrical
and<00:01:30.680> it<00:01:31.100> gives<00:01:31.610> it<00:01:32.000> a<00:01:32.240> very<00:01:32.540> interesting

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
and it gives it a very interesting

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.600 
and it gives it a very interesting
appearance<00:01:35.080> so<00:01:36.080> otherwise<00:01:36.380> I<00:01:36.770> like<00:01:37.250> more

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
appearance so otherwise I like more

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.370 
appearance so otherwise I like more
rough<00:01:37.850> from<00:01:38.920> number<00:01:40.210> 120<00:01:41.210> on<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:41.810> instruments

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
rough from number 120 on the instruments

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.050 
rough from number 120 on the instruments
were<00:01:42.530> kind<00:01:42.890> of<00:01:43.240> good<00:01:44.240> and<00:01:44.540> stable<00:01:44.869> and<00:01:46.060> that

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
were kind of good and stable and that

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.060 
were kind of good and stable and that
was<00:01:47.240> a<00:01:47.270> try

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
was a try

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.820 
was a try
with<00:01:49.050> feminization<00:01:50.050> on<00:01:50.170> the<00:01:50.320> end<00:01:50.470> cut<00:01:50.650> their

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
with feminization on the end cut their

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.180 
with feminization on the end cut their
instrument<00:01:51.250> and<00:01:51.400> that's<00:01:52.360> why<00:01:52.720> I<00:01:52.750> like<00:01:53.260> to

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
instrument and that's why I like to

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.810 
instrument and that's why I like to
build<00:01:54.400> with<00:01:54.780> this<00:01:55.780> disease<00:01:56.380> or<00:01:56.590> idea<00:01:57.100> gives

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
build with this disease or idea gives

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.450 
build with this disease or idea gives
another<00:01:58.060> freedom<00:01:58.570> there's<00:01:58.750> no<00:01:58.900> yeah<00:01:59.470> so<00:02:00.310> I<00:02:00.370> can

loosen and people should feel freedom if
it's<00:04:03.310> new<00:04:03.550> or<00:04:03.580> they<00:04:04.239> should<00:04:04.450> just<00:04:04.720> take<00:04:05.140> the

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290
