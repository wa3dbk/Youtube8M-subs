00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.470 
I like the solo look that's it is okay
as<00:02:10.660> far<00:02:10.810> as<00:02:10.929> comfort<00:02:11.170> but<00:02:11.560> um<00:02:12.030> sometimes<00:02:13.030> you

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
as far as comfort but um sometimes you

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.940 
as far as comfort but um sometimes you
know<00:02:13.690> you<00:02:14.050> want<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.380> have<00:02:15.340> a<00:02:15.370> passenger<00:02:15.820> so<00:02:16.240> I
