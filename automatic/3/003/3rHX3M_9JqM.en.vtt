00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
ones but that didn't come in my packet

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.720 
ones but that didn't come in my packet
that's<00:02:19.820> for<00:02:20.060> like<00:02:20.180> a<00:02:20.240> really<00:02:20.420> strong<00:02:21.730> abrasion

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
that's for like a really strong abrasion

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.310 
that's for like a really strong abrasion
but<00:02:24.250> since<00:02:25.250> my<00:02:25.490> skin<00:02:25.850> still<00:02:26.210> like<00:02:26.360> young<00:02:26.720> then

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
but since my skin still like young then

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.220 
but since my skin still like young then
I<00:02:27.560> don't<00:02:27.740> really<00:02:28.190> need<00:02:28.370> that<00:02:28.810> so<00:02:29.810> right<00:02:30.200> now

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
I don't really need that so right now

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.570 
I don't really need that so right now
I'm<00:02:30.410> just<00:02:30.470> going<00:02:30.680> to<00:02:30.710> be<00:02:30.830> using<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.160> blue<00:02:31.370> and

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
I'm just going to be using the blue and

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.950 
I'm just going to be using the blue and
I'm<00:02:31.670> going<00:02:31.820> to<00:02:31.850> show<00:02:32.060> you<00:02:32.120> how<00:02:32.180> you<00:02:32.450> can<00:02:32.540> use<00:02:32.780> it

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.690 

so<00:02:38.960> this<00:02:39.170> is<00:02:39.290> what<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:39.590> PMD<00:02:40.070> looks<00:02:40.310> like<00:02:40.520> you

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
so this is what the PMD looks like you

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.990 
so this is what the PMD looks like you
do<00:02:40.850> have<00:02:40.880> to<00:02:41.150> plug<00:02:41.360> it<00:02:41.510> in<00:02:41.600> when<00:02:41.630> you<00:02:41.840> use<00:02:42.020> it<00:02:42.050> um

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
do have to plug it in when you use it um

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.370 
do have to plug it in when you use it um
