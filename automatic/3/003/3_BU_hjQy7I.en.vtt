00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.730 
I play call of duty with one hand and
I'd<00:00:09.269> thought<00:00:09.540> that<00:00:09.809> today<00:00:09.929> I<00:00:10.080> would<00:00:10.530> make<00:00:10.710> a

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
I'd thought that today I would make a

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.070 
I'd thought that today I would make a
video<00:00:11.010> with<00:00:11.429> a<00:00:11.969> tutorial<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.660> show<00:00:12.780> you<00:00:12.960> guys

video with a tutorial to show you guys
how<00:00:13.259> I<00:00:13.530> do<00:00:13.679> it<00:00:13.830> I<00:00:14.549> think<00:00:15.030> it<00:00:15.179> was<00:00:15.240> about<00:00:15.389> mid

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
how I do it I think it was about mid

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.900 
how I do it I think it was about mid
modern<00:00:16.170> warfare<00:00:16.440> 3<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.279> put<00:00:17.580> out<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.699> video

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
modern warfare 3 that I put out a video

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.790 
modern warfare 3 that I put out a video
with<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.390> hand<00:00:18.660> came<00:00:18.900> in<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.170> top<00:00:19.350> right<00:00:19.590> corner

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
with a hand came in the top right corner

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.220 
with a hand came in the top right corner
and<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.220> I<00:00:20.939> thought<00:00:21.300> that<00:00:21.359> that<00:00:21.689> was<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.869> little

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
and and I thought that that was a little

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.990 
and and I thought that that was a little
long<00:00:22.439> ago<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:23.070> I<00:00:23.100> should<00:00:23.340> probably<00:00:23.550> do

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
long ago and that I should probably do

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.820 
long ago and that I should probably do
another<00:00:24.029> one<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.600> lot<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.350> my<00:00:25.500> new<00:00:25.650> subscribers

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
another one a lot of my new subscribers

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.080 
another one a lot of my new subscribers
and<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.430> lot<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:26.609> people<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:26.939> have<00:00:27.060> been

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
and a lot of people that have been

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.160
