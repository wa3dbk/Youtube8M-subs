00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
that's telling the system to get any

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.630 
that's telling the system to get any
variation<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:09.930> word<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.770> asterisk<00:01:11.430> is

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
variation of that word the asterisk is

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.420 
variation of that word the asterisk is
what<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:12.030> called<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.479> truncation<00:01:13.080> mark<00:01:13.710> or<00:01:14.010> a

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
what is called a truncation mark or a

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.600 
what is called a truncation mark or a
wild-card<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:16.619> tells<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.100> get<00:01:17.340> any

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
wild-card and it tells it to get any

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.910 
wild-card and it tells it to get any
variation<00:01:18.330> after<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.990> G<00:01:19.170> so<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.619> would<00:01:19.770> get

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
variation after the G so it would get

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.749 
variation after the G so it would get
technology<00:01:21.170> technologies<00:01:22.759> technological

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759
