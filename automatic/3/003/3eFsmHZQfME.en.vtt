00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
coolant like asshole

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.189 
coolant like asshole
so<00:00:14.340> then<00:00:15.000> with<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.240> head<00:00:15.389> off<00:00:15.570> through<00:00:16.109> the

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
so then with the head off through the

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.029 
so then with the head off through the
gasket<00:00:17.449> pretty<00:00:18.449> much<00:00:18.630> change<00:00:19.050> out<00:00:19.260> everything

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
gasket pretty much change out everything

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.279 
gasket pretty much change out everything
else<00:00:20.130> that's<00:00:20.490> in<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.640> process<00:00:20.900> just<00:00:21.900> refresh

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
else that's in the process just refresh

it<00:00:22.320> but<00:00:22.650> you've<00:00:22.769> done<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.010> lot<00:00:23.189> of<00:00:23.220> hours<00:00:23.609> so<00:00:23.850> use

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
it but you've done a lot of hours so use

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.920 
it but you've done a lot of hours so use
fairly<00:00:24.960> tired<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.910> so<00:00:26.910> pretty<00:00:27.539> much<00:00:27.660> start

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
then drain the coolant out and then

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.630 
then drain the coolant out and then
we'll<00:00:38.760> start<00:00:38.969> stripping<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.360> down<00:00:40.640> right

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
we'll start stripping it down right

want the strips of crap getting in the

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.620 
want the strips of crap getting in the
fuel<00:02:18.530> system<00:02:18.680> because<00:02:19.070> di<00:02:19.370> injectors<00:02:19.970> do<00:02:20.450> not

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
fuel system because di injectors do not

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.010 
fuel system because di injectors do not
like<00:02:20.870> any<00:02:21.200> foreign<00:02:21.950> object<00:02:22.310> whatsoever<00:02:23.020> so

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.710 

just<00:04:00.500> taking<00:04:00.799> the<00:04:00.830> time<00:04:00.920> to<00:04:01.690> pull<00:04:02.690> the

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
just taking the time to pull the

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.869 
just taking the time to pull the
radiators<00:04:03.290> out<00:04:03.440> to<00:04:03.799> a<00:04:03.830> cleaning<00:04:04.430> behind<00:04:04.640> them

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:04.879 
radiators out to a cleaning behind them

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:06.339 
radiators out to a cleaning behind them
because<00:04:05.090> the<00:04:05.239> ship<00:04:05.510> gets<00:04:05.750> built<00:04:05.959> up<00:04:06.049> in<00:04:06.200> there

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 
because the ship gets built up in there

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:08.920 
because the ship gets built up in there
and<00:04:06.440> a<00:04:06.670> blocks<00:04:07.670> a<00:04:07.790> radiator<00:04:08.150> and<00:04:08.239> B<00:04:08.510> rots<00:04:08.780> out

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
and a blocks a radiator and B rots out

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.729 
and a blocks a radiator and B rots out
so<00:04:09.319> we're<00:04:09.470> sorting<00:04:09.799> out<00:04:11.200> with<00:04:12.200> an<00:04:12.290> Aerodyne<00:04:12.530> in

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
so we're sorting out with an Aerodyne in

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:13.899 
so we're sorting out with an Aerodyne in
a<00:04:12.799> minute<00:04:13.010> problems<00:04:13.190> well<00:04:13.459> and<00:04:13.700> then<00:04:13.790> we'll

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:13.909 
a minute problems well and then we'll

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:15.300 
a minute problems well and then we'll
get<00:04:14.030> to<00:04:14.180> work<00:04:14.330> for<00:04:14.540> in<00:04:14.629> the<00:04:14.690> head<00:04:14.810> background

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
get to work for in the head background

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:26.590 
get to work for in the head background
so<00:04:16.310> this<00:04:16.400> is<00:04:16.549> what<00:04:16.639> the<00:04:16.729> airline's<00:04:17.030> for<00:04:25.330> yeah

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
so this is what the airline's for yeah

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:36.919 
so this is what the airline's for yeah
highly<00:04:27.169> necessary<00:04:27.320> compressor

the<00:05:58.250> floods<00:05:58.550> rain<00:06:00.880> just<00:06:01.880> talking<00:06:02.180> down<00:06:02.300> the

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:02.420 
the floods rain just talking down the

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.480 
the floods rain just talking down the
rocker<00:06:02.570> arms<00:06:02.960> now<00:06:03.140> and<00:06:03.890> then<00:06:04.250> we'll<00:06:04.370> do<00:06:04.460> the

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
rocker arms now and then we'll do the

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.160 
rocker arms now and then we'll do the
valve<00:06:04.760> clearances<00:06:05.240> soon<00:06:05.510> so<00:06:05.690> this<00:06:05.840> has<00:06:05.960> done<00:06:06.110> a

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:06.170 
valve clearances soon so this has done a

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.550 
valve clearances soon so this has done a
lot<00:06:06.290> of<00:06:06.350> ours<00:06:06.710> and<00:06:06.830> it's<00:06:06.980> never<00:06:07.160> been<00:06:07.220> done

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 
lot of ours and it's never been done

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.420 
lot of ours and it's never been done
okay<00:06:09.560> so<00:06:09.590> we're<00:06:09.860> just<00:06:09.890> doing<00:06:10.130> the<00:06:10.250> valve

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430 
okay so we're just doing the valve

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.490 
okay so we're just doing the valve
clearances<00:06:10.820> now<00:06:11.030> this<00:06:11.780> is<00:06:11.900> very<00:06:12.110> high<00:06:12.320> our

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:12.500 
clearances now this is very high our

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.780 
clearances now this is very high our
machine<00:06:12.890> so<00:06:13.010> it<00:06:13.100> seems<00:06:13.280> that<00:06:13.340> we've<00:06:13.520> got<00:06:13.640> the

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:13.790 
machine so it seems that we've got the

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.940 
machine so it seems that we've got the
rock<00:06:14.240> cover<00:06:14.450> off<00:06:14.630> we're<00:06:14.780> gonna<00:06:14.840> spec<00:06:15.500> up<00:06:15.650> all

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:15.950 
rock cover off we're gonna spec up all

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.610 
rock cover off we're gonna spec up all
the<00:06:16.100> air<00:06:16.220> inlet<00:06:16.520> and<00:06:16.670> axis<00:06:17.030> and<00:06:17.870> they<00:06:18.320> seem<00:06:18.590> to

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:18.620 
the air inlet and axis and they seem to

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.380 
the air inlet and axis and they seem to
have<00:06:18.710> closed<00:06:18.950> up<00:06:19.100> a<00:06:19.220> lot<00:06:19.400> actually<00:06:19.730> so<00:06:19.970> doing

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:20.390 
have closed up a lot actually so doing

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:23.110
