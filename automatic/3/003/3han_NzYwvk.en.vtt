00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:34.920 

give<00:03:26.660> it<00:03:26.720> a<00:03:26.750> little<00:03:26.900> fluff

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.979 

now<00:03:35.860> at<00:03:36.099> this<00:03:36.220> point<00:03:36.459> you<00:03:36.640> can<00:03:36.819> be<00:03:36.909> done<00:03:37.120> air

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
now at this point you can be done air

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.309 
now at this point you can be done air
dry<00:03:38.409> whatever<00:03:38.739> but<00:03:39.670> I<00:03:40.000> found<00:03:40.720> that<00:03:40.870> I<00:03:40.989> like<00:03:41.170> to

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
dry whatever but I found that I like to

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:48.119 
dry whatever but I found that I like to
diffuse<00:03:41.709> so<00:03:42.569> grab<00:03:43.569> your<00:03:43.750> little<00:03:43.870> car<00:03:47.129> and

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:50.220 
diffuse so grab your little car and
you're<00:03:48.340> diffusing<00:03:48.909> like<00:03:49.180> you<00:03:49.810> have<00:03:49.930> to<00:03:50.049> push

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
you're diffusing like you have to push

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.309 
you're diffusing like you have to push
really<00:03:50.260> hard<00:03:50.530> hard<00:03:53.250> toward<00:03:54.250> it<00:03:55.120> and<00:03:55.959> I'm<00:03:56.109> going

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
really hard hard toward it and I'm going

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.330 
really hard hard toward it and I'm going
to<00:03:56.349> take<00:03:56.560> it<00:03:56.799> on<00:03:57.329> low<00:03:58.379> speed<00:03:59.379> I<00:03:59.950> don't<00:04:00.189> know<00:04:00.280> if

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
to take it on low speed I don't know if

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.589 
to take it on low speed I don't know if
you<00:04:00.430> can<00:04:00.549> see<00:04:00.730> that<00:04:00.879> I'm<00:04:00.970> kind<00:04:01.180> of<00:04:01.209> weird<00:04:01.329> right

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 
you can see that I'm kind of weird right

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:03.899 
you can see that I'm kind of weird right
now<00:04:01.720> low<00:04:02.230> speed<00:04:02.560> low<00:04:02.799> heat<00:04:03.069> and<00:04:03.640> you're<00:04:03.760> going

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:03.909 
now low speed low heat and you're going

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:06.179 
now low speed low heat and you're going
to<00:04:03.939> diffuse<00:04:04.450> so<00:04:05.170> that's<00:04:05.379> my<00:04:05.530> next<00:04:05.769> step<00:04:05.980> so

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:06.189 
to diffuse so that's my next step so

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:07.979 
to diffuse so that's my next step so
that's<00:04:06.849> what<00:04:07.060> I'm<00:04:07.150> going<00:04:07.239> to<00:04:07.299> do<00:04:07.420> now<00:04:07.629> I<00:04:07.659> don't

that's what I'm going to do now I don't
want<00:04:08.109> to<00:04:08.170> do<00:04:08.230> that<00:04:08.319> on<00:04:08.440> camera<00:04:08.470> because<00:04:08.889> it's

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
want to do that on camera because it's
