00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.390
 these creativity is the life force 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.100
 modern society all over the world beat and 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.140
 we understand that our tech 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.900
 quadcopter useless without 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:27.260
 inventive pilots so we 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.390
 We present the matrix groan from DJ with 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.430
 using sdk anyone in any field 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.760
 activities can customize the platform 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.079
 for your specific flight plan 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.690
 satisfying their requirements 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.370
 thus the general principles of our 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.949
 technology can be used in more 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.409
 narrow areas enduring revolutionary 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:47.959
 changes to any application 

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:49.879
 this system from dj is designed 

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:51.799
 to help flight developers 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.030
 technology creation of new equipment 

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:56.239
 and programs 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.369
 matrices this quadrocopter ogoy dance this 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.879
 obstacle detecting sensory 

00:00:58.369 --> 00:01:03.139
 extensions their combination is powerful 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.570
 tool allowing developers 

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:07.909
 use DJ development package 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:12.289
 also hardware integration to create 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:14.359
 non-standard flight solutions this 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:17.149
 we developed a compact camera and 

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:19.369
 it's highly efficient infrared 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:21.109
 camera all our cameras distinguish 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.570
 temperature in increments of less than one tenth 

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:24.920
 degrees for sensor manufacturers and 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:29.780
 cameras drone this platform 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:32.119
 allowing the sensor to fly another 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.770
 innovative solutions of matrices 100 our 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.659
 newest prevention system 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.850
 collision guy dance 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.130
 probably a complex system is studying 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.609
 setting around matrice thats from all 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.890
 parties 

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:48.679
 bottom front back right and left is 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.749
 means that 100 matrices always know what 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:52.429
 is around and automatically 

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:54.500
 will adjust the flight plan when 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:56.929
 approaching objects or by crane 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.209
 my team works with enthusiasm 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:01.880
 DJ over the development of this device 

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:04.159
 and supports their products in 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.109
 university fu tribute we integrated 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.599
 matrice 100 guy dance program 

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:11.030
 DJ development and equipment intel 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:13.190
 for batteries we use all these 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.110
 devices to get real 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.299
 original solution for the city 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.950
 our system is designed to 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:21.049
 help the city authorities reveal 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.780
 parked cars 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:26.239
 in the extra compartment will allow you 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.190
 add components and fly with any 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.480
 devices 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.190
 universal power and transmission ports 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.680
 data allow you to use 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.739
 almost any device 2 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.340
 battery compartment lighter frame and 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.260
 energy efficient power transfer 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.590
 allows you to provide amazing 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.359
 flight time as much as 40 minutes we also 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.530
 We present a new management system 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:50.989
 flight n1 installed in matrice 100 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.599
 n1 fully customizable radius 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.579
 actions up to two miles control matrices 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:58.340
 stock from such distances became possible 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:00.530
 thanks to the lightbridge technology we are 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.359
 no pilots and the ability to just fly no 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.459
 thinking about the flight process itself 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:06.829
 and concentrate on the choice 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.380
 cameras that's what matters to us both for 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:10.970
 system integrator giving everyone 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.639
 the ability to use key 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.709
 elements of matrices 100 we expand 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:18.139
 unexplored research opportunities 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.120
 territories and the creation of specialized 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:23.000
 airborne imaging systems 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.299
 in all areas of industry around 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.299
 the world
