00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
dry ones but to me honestly I think

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.789 
dry ones but to me honestly I think
they're<00:01:03.660> both<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.930> same<00:01:03.960> thing<00:01:04.350> called<00:01:04.619> are

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
they're both the same thing called are

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.320 
they're both the same thing called are
using<00:01:05.460> these<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:06.470> what<00:01:07.470> end<00:01:07.710> firm<00:01:08.670> surfaces

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
using these and what end firm surfaces

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.289 
using these and what end firm surfaces
