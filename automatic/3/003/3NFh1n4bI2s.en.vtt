00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.059
 Hi people 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.000
 in this video I'll show you how to do this 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.750
 collor hour effect or color it we 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.750
 June 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.410
 I think this look super beautiful and it's very easy 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.410
 to do 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.529
 I used four enamels in total one 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.740
 color as the base color and three colors on the 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:34.829
 style candy colors a blue whiting a lilac 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:38.160
 and honored clarinet I also used a sponge 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.100
 make-up and regular tweezers 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.950
 so let's start I started painting 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.430
 Corrective white nails even and 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.010
 I hope ck there the tear pieces of sponge 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.430
 one piece for each color I'm going to use 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.219
 in the case of this girl are three ne 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.770
 I do this because the torn piece 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.469
 becomes more porous and gives the desired effect 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.939
 besides being easier to handle given 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:08.580
 that the entire sponge that's just look 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.530
 sponge piece in enamel and 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.780
 little hits on the streets 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.210
 I'll do it with all the colors 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.790
 Where I want them to stay in the nail 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.520
 this technique is cool because everything depends 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.150
 of your preference the intensity of 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.670
 colors where each color will stay in the nail 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:29.430
 for example to make it more intense is just 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.740
 give more hits but you can choose 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.560
 for doing more here like me 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:39.320
 and even weaker than this, only one 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.320
 a trace of color even looks very cute 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.729
 there is one very important thing that is 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.550
 when you can get to the 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.720
 intensity and effects in all 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.240
 the colors 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.640
 You need to start mixing colors. 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.970
 where they meet so they do not stay in 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.759
 very marked lines ie you will 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.520
 invade the space of a color by placing a 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.890
 little bit over another color 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.760
 even just to give a mixed and 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:17.010
 Lightweight boots also on the video. 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.959
 see that this technique makes a little mess 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.630
 around 21 years old, right? 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:24.780
 It's very easy and clean but if you want 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.330
 have less work just tape paste 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.700
 adhesive around 2 Luis or use that 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.709
 glue around the streets to 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.200
 make dirt easier 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.300
 I did not do any of these things and 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.700
 after passing the extra brightness that is 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.100
 super important in this look 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.850
 I cleaned with cotton with acetone in the 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:47.610
 Even the extra glitter toothpick really is 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.430
 the final touch that will leave your time k 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:53.250
 perfect hler and smooth all 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.950
 imperfections stripped 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.090
 Well I think the best is super cute 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.220
 delicate 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.630
 I love it so much to use it as long as 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.880
 as a basis for a stamped for example 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:08.370
