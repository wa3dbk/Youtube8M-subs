 bronze analysis gameplay comes over me 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.040
 had a little thought that the 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.020
 people then partially attacked 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.400
 but on the contrary they found one could 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.729
 then take something and it was right 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:34.680
