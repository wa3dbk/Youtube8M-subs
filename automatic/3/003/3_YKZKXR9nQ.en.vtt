00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
hey Andrew Coleman here with adsr sounds

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.490 
hey Andrew Coleman here with adsr sounds
and<00:00:02.820> this<00:00:03.240> week<00:00:03.449> I<00:00:03.600> have<00:00:03.629> a<00:00:03.810> quick<00:00:04.110> tip<00:00:04.290> for

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
and this week I have a quick tip for

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.019 
and this week I have a quick tip for
machine<00:00:04.799> dealing<00:00:05.220> with<00:00:05.339> some<00:00:05.520> cool<00:00:05.759> drum

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
machine dealing with some cool drum

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.450 
machine dealing with some cool drum
sequencing<00:00:06.629> techniques<00:00:07.170> so<00:00:08.069> before<00:00:08.309> we<00:00:08.370> get

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
sequencing techniques so before we get

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.560 
sequencing techniques so before we get
into<00:00:08.670> it<00:00:08.700> let's<00:00:08.910> take<00:00:09.090> a<00:00:09.150> look<00:00:09.300> at<00:00:09.389> how<00:00:09.480> it

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
into it let's take a look at how it

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:17.810 
into it let's take a look at how it
sounds<00:00:09.929> here<00:00:10.349> we<00:00:10.440> go<00:00:16.369> so<00:00:17.369> if<00:00:17.430> you<00:00:17.520> want<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.730> get

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
sounds here we go so if you want to get

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.340 
sounds here we go so if you want to get
a<00:00:17.850> better<00:00:18.090> idea<00:00:18.210> we'll<00:00:18.539> go<00:00:18.690> ahead<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:18.990> mute<00:00:19.050> my

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
a better idea we'll go ahead and mute my

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.840 
a better idea we'll go ahead and mute my
instruments<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.070> then<00:00:20.160> here's<00:00:20.430> just<00:00:20.490> the

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
instruments and then here's just the

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.570 
instruments and then here's just the
drums<00:00:24.289> so<00:00:25.289> let's<00:00:25.470> go<00:00:25.650> ahead<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:26.160> take<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.369> look

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
drums so let's go ahead and take a look

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.880 
drums so let's go ahead and take a look
at<00:00:26.760> how<00:00:26.910> I<00:00:26.939> actually<00:00:27.269> did<00:00:27.810> this<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.560> so<00:00:28.769> what

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
at how I actually did this and so what

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.429 
at how I actually did this and so what
this<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.070> is<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.400> combination<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.810> sample

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
this is is a combination of a sample

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.380 
this is is a combination of a sample
break<00:00:31.769> beat<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.189> then<00:00:32.579> I<00:00:32.669> chop<00:00:32.910> this<00:00:33.030> up<00:00:33.239> and

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
break beat and then I chop this up and

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.450 
break beat and then I chop this up and
resequenced<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.320> then<00:00:34.800> on<00:00:34.950> top<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.399> I

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
resequenced it and then on top of that I

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.250 
resequenced it and then on top of that I
have<00:00:35.760> some<00:00:36.000> individual<00:00:36.480> drum<00:00:36.690> samples<00:00:37.110> and

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
have some individual drum samples and

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.650 
have some individual drum samples and
those<00:00:37.770> are<00:00:38.100> layered<00:00:38.370> on<00:00:38.640> top<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:39.120> that<00:00:39.329> break

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
those are layered on top of that break

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.450 
those are layered on top of that break
beat<00:00:39.870> I'm<00:00:40.290> social<00:00:40.800> say<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.950> whole<00:00:41.129> bunch<00:00:41.340> of

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
beat I'm social say a whole bunch of

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.580 
beat I'm social say a whole bunch of
different<00:00:41.640> drum<00:00:42.030> layering<00:00:42.480> um<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:43.260> here<00:00:43.440> are

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
different drum layering um so here are

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.590 
different drum layering um so here are
my<00:00:43.770> first<00:00:44.340> eight<00:00:44.550> pads<00:00:44.789> on<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.090> bottom<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.570> have

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
my first eight pads on the bottom I have

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.630 
my first eight pads on the bottom I have
that<00:00:46.469> sampled<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.100> chopped<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.430> break<00:00:47.610> beat<00:00:49.640> so

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
that sampled and chopped a break beat so

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:58.760 
that sampled and chopped a break beat so
if<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:50.879> try<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.059> play<00:00:51.270> back<00:00:57.320> so<00:00:58.320> this<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.500> just

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
if I try to play back so this is just

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.349 
if I try to play back so this is just
chopped<00:00:59.070> on<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.399> different<00:00:59.730> parts<00:00:59.910> of<00:01:00.210> the

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
chopped on the different parts of the

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.520 
chopped on the different parts of the
break<00:01:00.510> beat<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.899> then<00:01:00.989> I'm<00:01:01.170> going<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.410> go

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
break beat and then I'm going to go

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.660 
break beat and then I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.949> play<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.129> back<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.280> little<00:01:02.430> bit

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
ahead and play it back a little bit

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.850 
ahead and play it back a little bit
differently<00:01:03.120> um<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:03.899> get<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.229> sort<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.769> a

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
differently um so you get a sort of a

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.700 
differently um so you get a sort of a
different<00:01:04.979> vibe<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.880> drum<00:01:06.150> groove<00:01:06.360> I

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.200 

can't<00:01:10.710> remember<00:01:10.830> how<00:01:11.159> this<00:01:11.340> exactly<00:01:11.490> sounds

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
can't remember how this exactly sounds

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.670 
can't remember how this exactly sounds
but<00:01:12.450> um<00:01:12.600> I'll<00:01:12.960> go<00:01:13.110> ahead<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.409> play<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.560> like

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
but um I'll go ahead and play it like

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:21.980 
but um I'll go ahead and play it like
this<00:01:19.790> so<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:20.850> can<00:01:21.000> see<00:01:21.150> I'm<00:01:21.360> just<00:01:21.390> using<00:01:21.780> the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
this so you can see I'm just using the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.499 
this so you can see I'm just using the
different<00:01:22.290> slices<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.890> sort<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.189> sort<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.240> chop

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
different slices to sort of sort of chop

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.420 
different slices to sort of sort of chop
it<00:01:24.630> up<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:24.930> then<00:01:25.049> replay<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.070> break<00:01:26.220> beat

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
it up and then replay the the break beat

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.340 
it up and then replay the the break beat
in<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.970> way<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.270> suits<00:01:27.450> my<00:01:27.689> project<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.229> little

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
in a way that suits my project a little

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.649 
in a way that suits my project a little
bit<00:01:28.500> better<00:01:28.829> I'm<00:01:29.369> so<00:01:29.610> not<00:01:29.820> limited<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.270> the

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
bit better I'm so not limited to the

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.960 
bit better I'm so not limited to the
same<00:01:30.960> notes<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.560> same<00:01:31.770> groove<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.790> the

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
same notes the same groove that the

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.149 
same notes the same groove that the
original<00:01:33.479> beat<00:01:33.630> had<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.200> then<00:01:34.710> on<00:01:34.860> top<00:01:35.040> of

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
original beat had and then on top of

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.800 
original beat had and then on top of
that<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.280> layer<00:01:35.610> some<00:01:35.909> additional<00:01:36.270> sounds<00:01:36.689> they

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
that I layer some additional sounds they

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.830 
that I layer some additional sounds they
sound<00:01:37.049> like<00:01:37.110> this<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.560> have<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.100> kick<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.579> shaker<00:01:39.479> a

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
sound like this I have a kick a shaker a

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.190 
sound like this I have a kick a shaker a
nice<00:01:40.530> clap<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.220> then<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.640> hi-hat<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:42.960> on

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
nice clap and then a hi-hat and so on

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.359 
nice clap and then a hi-hat and so on
their<00:01:43.350> own<00:01:43.530> these<00:01:43.829> sound<00:01:44.159> like<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:48.979> so<00:01:49.979> super

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
their own these sound like this so super

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.310 
their own these sound like this so super
weak<00:01:50.549> it's<00:01:50.820> just<00:01:51.119> just<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.750> little<00:01:52.020> bit<00:01:52.140> of

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
weak it's just just a little bit of

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.020 
weak it's just just a little bit of
additional<00:01:52.590> layering<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.250> goes<00:01:53.430> on<00:01:53.640> top<00:01:53.880> of

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
additional layering that goes on top of

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.389 
additional layering that goes on top of
it<00:01:54.149> um<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.049> kick<00:01:55.290> sort<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:55.860> fills<00:01:56.130> out<00:01:56.280> the

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
it um so the kick sort of fills out the

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.670 
it um so the kick sort of fills out the
lower<00:01:56.579> end<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.719> snare<00:01:58.020> shaker<00:01:58.380> and

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
lower end and the snare shaker and

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.080 
lower end and the snare shaker and
hi-hats<00:01:59.130> or<00:01:59.369> just<00:01:59.549> add<00:01:59.670> some<00:01:59.909> additional

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
hi-hats or just add some additional

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.539 
hi-hats or just add some additional
flair<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.140> overall<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.710> drum<00:02:01.920> groove<00:02:02.280> um

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
flair to the overall the drum groove um

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.520 
flair to the overall the drum groove um
so<00:02:03.240> each<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.570> these<00:02:03.659> parts<00:02:03.930> on<00:02:04.020> their<00:02:04.140> own<00:02:04.259> are

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
so each of these parts on their own are

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.380 
so each of these parts on their own are
kind<00:02:04.890> of<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.100> little<00:02:05.250> bit<00:02:05.399> weak<00:02:05.579> but<00:02:05.790> when<00:02:06.240> you

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
kind of a little bit weak but when you

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.819 
kind of a little bit weak but when you
layer<00:02:06.600> them<00:02:06.719> together<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:07.290> get<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.469> really

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
layer them together you get a really

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.040 
layer them together you get a really
nice<00:02:08.099> sounding<00:02:08.610> drum<00:02:08.879> groove<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.330> then<00:02:09.869> we'll

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
nice sounding drum groove and then we'll

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.869 
nice sounding drum groove and then we'll
go<00:02:10.170> ahead<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.619> just<00:02:11.039> play<00:02:11.220> this<00:02:11.370> over<00:02:11.580> once

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
go ahead and just play this over once

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.600 
go ahead and just play this over once
more

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.460 

so<00:02:17.610> in<00:02:18.120> addition<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.570> this<00:02:18.690> I<00:02:18.840> just<00:02:19.020> have<00:02:19.170> some

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
so in addition to this I just have some

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.740 
so in addition to this I just have some
effects<00:02:19.830> on<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.190> group<00:02:20.400> level<00:02:20.640> I'm<00:02:21.480> going

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
effects on the group level I'm going

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.210 
effects on the group level I'm going
through<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.110> I<00:02:22.170> added<00:02:22.350> solid<00:02:22.980> buss

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
through and I added solid buss

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.640 
through and I added solid buss
compressor<00:02:23.820> and<00:02:24.060> some<00:02:24.720> saturation<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:25.530> that

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
compressor and some saturation and that

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.410 
compressor and some saturation and that
just<00:02:25.830> ties<00:02:26.070> the<00:02:26.280> entire<00:02:26.610> drum<00:02:26.910> group<00:02:27.180> together

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
just ties the entire drum group together

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.840 
just ties the entire drum group together
um<00:02:27.900> so<00:02:28.500> this<00:02:28.680> is<00:02:28.740> a<00:02:28.890> technique<00:02:29.400> that<00:02:29.459> you<00:02:29.700> can

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
um so this is a technique that you can

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.180 
um so this is a technique that you can
use<00:02:30.030> a<00:02:30.060> lot<00:02:30.420> if<00:02:30.780> you<00:02:30.930> find<00:02:31.140> some<00:02:31.320> nice<00:02:31.470> old<00:02:31.890> drum

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
use a lot if you find some nice old drum

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.890 
use a lot if you find some nice old drum
brakes<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:32.910> can<00:02:33.060> sequence<00:02:33.330> those<00:02:33.570> up<00:02:33.750> into

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
brakes you can sequence those up into

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.330 
brakes you can sequence those up into
your<00:02:34.020> project<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:34.560> then<00:02:34.680> layer<00:02:34.860> additional

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
your project and then layer additional

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.190 
your project and then layer additional
samples<00:02:35.670> on<00:02:35.820> top<00:02:36.030> of<00:02:36.150> that<00:02:36.240> to<00:02:36.720> get<00:02:36.810> this<00:02:36.990> sound

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
samples on top of that to get this sound

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.180 
samples on top of that to get this sound
that<00:02:37.290> you're<00:02:37.530> looking<00:02:37.830> for

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
that you're looking for

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.040 
that you're looking for
