00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
this and i believe this is what the

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.490 
this and i believe this is what the
loading<00:00:33.360> screen<00:00:33.390> is<00:00:33.750> going<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:33.930> look<00:00:34.079> like<00:00:34.110> and

as many of you guys know the loading

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.940 
as many of you guys know the loading
screen<00:00:36.239> usually<00:00:36.719> relates<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.530> easter<00:00:37.860> egg

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.139 
screen usually relates to the easter egg
in<00:00:38.070> some<00:00:38.219> way<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.520> i<00:00:38.550> believe<00:00:38.790> this<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.059> what

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
in some way and i believe this is what

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.610 
in some way and i believe this is what
the<00:00:39.270> Easter<00:00:39.390> eggs<00:00:39.690> going<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.930> be<00:00:39.989> about<00:00:40.110> trying

to escape alcatraz island and does that
mean<00:00:43.140> i<00:00:43.230> think<00:00:43.440> this<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.770> going<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:43.980> let<00:00:44.129> you

mean i think this is going to let you
finish<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.820> game<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.270> sort<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.510> end<00:00:45.780> zombies

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
no i don't think that but i believe this

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.220

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
friends you'll also enter this mode so I

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.210 
friends you'll also enter this mode so I
think<00:01:12.810> that's<00:01:12.960> pretty<00:01:13.140> interesting<00:01:13.380> stuff<00:01:13.619> in

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
think that's pretty interesting stuff in

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.710 
think that's pretty interesting stuff in
this<00:01:14.369> clip<00:01:14.610> here<00:01:14.790> you'll<00:01:14.939> actually<00:01:15.090> see<00:01:15.450> if<00:01:15.630> I

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.020 
is going to be powerful in all rounds
but<00:01:59.850> hopefully<00:02:00.329> it<00:02:00.450> is<00:02:01.130> finally<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.340> lot<00:02:02.969> of

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
but hopefully it is finally a lot of

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.160 
but hopefully it is finally a lot of
people<00:02:03.149> don't<00:02:03.360> know<00:02:03.390> about<00:02:03.479> yet<00:02:03.719> is<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.930> new

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
special grenade like monkey bombs but

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.490 
special grenade like monkey bombs but
this<00:02:06.299> one's<00:02:06.479> going<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.630> be<00:02:06.719> it<00:02:06.840> seems<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.469> be

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
this one's going to be it seems to be

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.979 
this one's going to be it seems to be
flaming<00:02:07.890> tomahawks<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:09.479> don't<00:02:09.840> know<00:02:09.899> if

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
flaming tomahawks and I don't know if

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.330 
flaming tomahawks and I don't know if
they<00:02:10.140> have<00:02:10.229> really<00:02:10.440> good<00:02:10.530> at<00:02:10.709> killing<00:02:10.890> zombies

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
they have really good at killing zombies

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.650 
they have really good at killing zombies
or<00:02:11.459> not<00:02:11.610> but<00:02:11.790> as<00:02:11.879> you<00:02:12.000> can<00:02:12.090> see<00:02:12.239> in<00:02:12.330> this<00:02:12.420> clip

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
or not but as you can see in this clip

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.430 
or not but as you can see in this clip
here<00:02:12.870> he

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
here he

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.920 
here he
tomahawks<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.250> nuke<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:14.850> actually<00:02:15.390> brings<00:02:15.690> the

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
tomahawks a nuke and actually brings the

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.900 
tomahawks a nuke and actually brings the
power<00:02:16.140> up<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:16.620> him<00:02:16.800> so<00:02:17.340> I<00:02:17.370> think<00:02:17.610> that's<00:02:17.760> pretty

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
power up to him so I think that's pretty

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.040 
power up to him so I think that's pretty
cool<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:18.330> I<00:02:18.420> think<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.570> lot<00:02:18.690> of<00:02:18.720> people<00:02:18.780> don't

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
cool and I think a lot of people don't

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.870 
cool and I think a lot of people don't
know<00:02:19.140> about<00:02:19.170> that<00:02:19.410> yet<00:02:19.620> a<00:02:20.010> lot<00:02:20.490> of<00:02:20.520> people<00:02:20.610> are

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
know about that yet a lot of people are

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.920 
know about that yet a lot of people are
saying<00:02:21.030> that<00:02:21.210> this<00:02:21.300> is<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.510> really<00:02:21.810> good

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
saying that this is a really good

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.510 
saying that this is a really good
close-up<00:02:22.350> of<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.590> new<00:02:22.710> boss<00:02:22.980> zombie<00:02:23.340> but<00:02:23.490> I

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
close-up of the new boss zombie but I

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.830 
close-up of the new boss zombie but I
think<00:02:23.850> it<00:02:23.940> is<00:02:24.030> I<00:02:24.060> think<00:02:24.240> this<00:02:24.510> is<00:02:24.630> just<00:02:24.780> a

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
think it is I think this is just a

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.750 
think it is I think this is just a
regular<00:02:25.050> old<00:02:25.230> zombie<00:02:25.680> butt<00:02:26.160> of<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.370> clips<00:02:26.580> we

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
regular old zombie butt of the clips we

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.700

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
smashing it with his fist so that's

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.200 
smashing it with his fist so that's
definitely<00:02:38.430> something<00:02:38.670> you<00:02:38.820> don't<00:02:39.030> want<00:02:39.150> to

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
definitely something you don't want to

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.190 
definitely something you don't want to
happen<00:02:39.330> you<00:02:39.510> want<00:02:39.630> to<00:02:39.720> take<00:02:39.840> this<00:02:39.960> guy<00:02:40.170> out

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
happen you want to take this guy out

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.660 
happen you want to take this guy out
straight<00:02:40.620> away<00:02:40.650> before<00:02:40.950> you<00:02:41.130> can<00:02:41.250> do<00:02:41.400> any<00:02:41.580> of

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
straight away before you can do any of

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.940 
straight away before you can do any of
that<00:02:41.700> now<00:02:42.270> it<00:02:42.780> seems<00:02:43.170> that<00:02:43.320> he's<00:02:43.440> not<00:02:43.620> as<00:02:43.740> hard

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
that now it seems that he's not as hard

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.560 
that now it seems that he's not as hard
as<00:02:44.130> other<00:02:44.280> boss<00:02:44.490> lamese<00:02:44.820> like<00:02:44.970> George<00:02:45.210> Romero

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
as other boss lamese like George Romero

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.120 
as other boss lamese like George Romero
because<00:02:45.840> he<00:02:45.930> seems<00:02:46.140> to<00:02:46.260> die<00:02:46.470> in<00:02:46.530> one<00:02:46.770> shot<00:02:47.010> from

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
because he seems to die in one shot from

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.710 
because he seems to die in one shot from
insta-kill<00:02:47.610> but<00:02:48.150> that<00:02:48.300> leads<00:02:48.450> me<00:02:48.540> to<00:02:48.690> believe

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
insta-kill but that leads me to believe

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.300 
insta-kill but that leads me to believe
that<00:02:49.020> maybe<00:02:49.230> he'll<00:02:49.470> come<00:02:49.650> every<00:02:49.920> couple<00:02:50.130> of

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
that maybe he'll come every couple of

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.390 
that maybe he'll come every couple of
rounds<00:02:50.840> electric<00:02:51.840> cherry<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.440> new<00:02:52.590> perk<00:02:52.890> and

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
rounds electric cherry the new perk and

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.830 
rounds electric cherry the new perk and
what<00:02:53.610> it<00:02:53.700> seems<00:02:53.880> to<00:02:53.970> do<00:02:54.120> is<00:02:54.270> when<00:02:54.420> you<00:02:54.480> reload

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
what it seems to do is when you reload

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.060 
what it seems to do is when you reload
it<00:02:55.020> electrocutes<00:02:55.440> dombey's<00:02:55.860> in<00:02:55.980> the

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
it electrocutes dombey's in the

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.280 
it electrocutes dombey's in the
immediate<00:02:56.280> area<00:02:56.580> and<00:02:56.970> it<00:02:57.390> scales<00:02:57.690> over<00:02:57.960> time<00:02:58.260> I

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
immediate area and it scales over time I

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.600 
immediate area and it scales over time I
don't<00:02:58.500> know<00:02:58.560> if<00:02:58.650> that<00:02:58.800> means<00:02:58.980> that<00:02:59.250> it<00:02:59.340> you

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
don't know if that means that it you

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.190 
don't know if that means that it you
know<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.790> blast<00:03:00.030> radius<00:03:00.150> gets<00:03:00.660> bigger<00:03:00.930> or<00:03:01.080> the

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
know the blast radius gets bigger or the

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.330 
know the blast radius gets bigger or the
more<00:03:01.380> likely<00:03:01.410> of<00:03:01.770> the<00:03:01.800> two<00:03:01.860> it<00:03:02.070> does<00:03:02.190> more

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
more likely of the two it does more

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.400 
more likely of the two it does more
damage<00:03:02.370> over<00:03:02.910> time<00:03:02.940> but<00:03:03.570> a<00:03:03.630> pro<00:03:03.900> tip<00:03:04.140> I<00:03:04.260> can

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
damage over time but a pro tip I can

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:05.390 
damage over time but a pro tip I can
probably<00:03:04.560> give<00:03:04.800> you<00:03:04.890> now<00:03:05.040> if<00:03:05.190> it<00:03:05.310> actually

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
probably give you now if it actually

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.040 
probably give you now if it actually
does<00:03:05.640> a<00:03:05.670> decent<00:03:06.000> amount<00:03:06.060> of<00:03:06.180> damage<00:03:06.510> will<00:03:06.930> be

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
does a decent amount of damage will be

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.840 
does a decent amount of damage will be
to<00:03:07.170> circle<00:03:07.590> zombies<00:03:07.950> in<00:03:08.070> a<00:03:08.130> rape<00:03:08.340> train<00:03:08.610> and
