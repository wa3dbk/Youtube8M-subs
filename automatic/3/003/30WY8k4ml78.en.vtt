00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
up the app launch it and get it up to

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.950 
up the app launch it and get it up to
where<00:00:43.820> you're<00:00:44.000> actually<00:00:44.150> viewing<00:00:44.540> the<00:00:44.780> drone

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
where you're actually viewing the drone

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.000 
where you're actually viewing the drone

here<00:01:45.890> and<00:01:46.070> show<00:01:46.999> you<00:01:47.060> how<00:01:47.299> to<00:01:47.329> check<00:01:47.929> it<00:01:48.079> make

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
here and show you how to check it make

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.919 
here and show you how to check it make
sure<00:01:48.259> everything<00:01:48.829> is<00:01:48.950> working<00:01:49.509> these<00:01:50.509> buttons

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
sure everything is working these buttons

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:52.300 
sure everything is working these buttons
up<00:01:51.049> here<00:01:51.200> the<00:01:51.319> triggers<00:01:51.649> do<00:01:51.829> seem<00:01:52.069> to<00:01:52.159> be<00:01:52.280> a

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
up here the triggers do seem to be a

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.459 
up here the triggers do seem to be a
little<00:01:52.460> touchy<00:01:52.780> so<00:01:53.780> I<00:01:53.869> would<00:01:54.020> put<00:01:54.229> one<00:01:54.439> there

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:54.469 
little touchy so I would put one there

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:56.800 
little touchy so I would put one there
and<00:01:54.890> then<00:01:55.100> go<00:01:55.369> out<00:01:55.520> see<00:01:55.789> if<00:01:55.819> it<00:01:55.969> works<00:01:56.210> and<00:01:56.479> then

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
and then go out see if it works and then

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.569 
and then go out see if it works and then
you<00:01:57.170> know<00:01:57.259> test<00:01:57.679> it<00:01:57.829> as<00:01:57.920> you<00:01:58.069> do<00:01:58.189> it<00:01:58.310> until<00:01:58.490> you

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
you know test it as you do it until you

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:00.010 
you know test it as you do it until you
get<00:01:58.670> the<00:01:58.759> right<00:01:58.880> spot<00:01:59.479> so<00:01:59.509> that<00:01:59.810> it<00:01:59.869> actually

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
get the right spot so that it actually

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.319 
get the right spot so that it actually
works<00:02:00.380> for<00:02:00.619> the<00:02:00.679> button<00:02:00.950> but<00:02:01.850> basically<00:02:02.270> if

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
works for the button but basically if

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:04.120 
works for the button but basically if
you're<00:02:02.420> gonna<00:02:02.539> put<00:02:02.749> a<00:02:02.780> button<00:02:02.990> you<00:02:03.710> grab<00:02:03.950> the

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
right over here to where the map is at

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.530 
right over here to where the map is at
and<00:02:17.830> then<00:02:18.830> you'll<00:02:19.340> have<00:02:19.459> a<00:02:19.519> little<00:02:19.819> question

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
bit and it'll actually work usually I

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.350 
bit and it'll actually work usually I

was try it there and see if it works

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.730 
was try it there and see if it works
there<00:02:50.360> see<00:02:50.690> and<00:02:51.170> I<00:02:51.230> don't<00:02:51.320> have<00:02:51.500> a<00:02:51.530> map

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740

so it won't pull up but that's where the

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.980 
so it won't pull up but that's where the
map<00:02:55.370> would<00:02:55.580> normally<00:02:55.970> come<00:02:56.090> up<00:02:56.240> there<00:02:56.450> and<00:02:56.570> see

I do it you're gonna see the camera move
a<00:05:24.210> little<00:05:24.330> bit<00:05:24.479> that's<00:05:24.570> why<00:05:24.750> I<00:05:24.780> want<00:05:25.020> to<00:05:25.080> get

a little bit that's why I want to get

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:27.050 
a little bit that's why I want to get
two<00:05:25.350> of<00:05:25.380> these<00:05:25.620> but<00:05:26.340> I<00:05:26.400> just<00:05:26.580> want<00:05:26.760> to<00:05:26.820> show<00:05:26.970> you

guys<00:05:27.120> basically<00:05:27.450> how<00:05:27.930> to<00:05:27.990> do<00:05:28.260> it<00:05:28.760> you<00:05:29.760> know

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
guys basically how to do it you know

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.610 
guys basically how to do it you know
that<00:05:29.910> way<00:05:30.090> you<00:05:30.120> can<00:05:30.330> figure<00:05:30.660> out<00:05:30.810> you<00:05:31.590> know

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
that way you can figure out you know

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.120 
that way you can figure out you know
work<00:05:32.070> with<00:05:32.100> it<00:05:32.400> a<00:05:32.430> little<00:05:32.460> bit<00:05:32.669> play<00:05:33.090> with<00:05:33.300> it

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
work with it a little bit play with it

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.020 
work with it a little bit play with it
you<00:05:35.130> know<00:05:35.250> it<00:05:35.340> takes<00:05:35.550> a<00:05:35.639> little<00:05:35.729> bit<00:05:35.880> of

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
you know it takes a little bit of

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:43.159 
you know it takes a little bit of
practice<00:05:36.180> to<00:05:36.889> to<00:05:37.889> get<00:05:38.720> get<00:05:39.720> to<00:05:40.050> do<00:05:40.229> it<00:05:40.380> so<00:05:42.169> you

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:43.169 
practice to to get get to do it so you

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:44.540 
practice to to get get to do it so you
know<00:05:43.260> you<00:05:43.289> just<00:05:43.530> like<00:05:43.889> I<00:05:43.979> said<00:05:44.160> you<00:05:44.250> just<00:05:44.310> do

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
know you just like I said you just do

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:52.899 
know you just like I said you just do
like<00:05:44.729> this<00:05:44.940> and<00:05:46.190> and

00:05:52.899 --> 00:05:52.909 

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:56.119 

right<00:05:53.909> up<00:05:54.150> down<00:05:54.449> okay<00:05:54.870> there<00:05:55.080> we<00:05:55.169> go<00:05:55.500> so<00:05:55.979> now

00:05:56.119 --> 00:05:56.129 
right up down okay there we go so now

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:59.180 
right up down okay there we go so now
when<00:05:56.310> I<00:05:56.340> hit<00:05:56.430> down<00:05:56.849> see<00:05:57.810> it'll<00:05:57.990> go<00:05:58.080> down<00:05:58.259> when<00:05:59.159> I

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.190 
when I hit down see it'll go down when I

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:05.360 
when I hit down see it'll go down when I
hit<00:05:59.370> up<00:06:00.080> and<00:06:01.080> it<00:06:01.169> comes<00:06:01.229> back<00:06:01.530> up<00:06:04.099> go<00:06:05.099> to<00:06:05.280> the

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
hit up and it comes back up go to the

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:11.119 
hit up and it comes back up go to the
right<00:06:05.580> to<00:06:05.909> the<00:06:06.870> left<00:06:09.530> see<00:06:10.530> but<00:06:10.680> you<00:06:10.770> see<00:06:10.919> how<00:06:11.009> it

00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:11.129 
right to the left see but you see how it

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:12.980 
right to the left see but you see how it
moves<00:06:11.340> a<00:06:11.490> little<00:06:11.520> bit<00:06:11.849> that's<00:06:12.360> just<00:06:12.599> because<00:06:12.690> I

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:12.990 
moves a little bit that's just because I

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:14.809 
moves a little bit that's just because I
don't<00:06:13.050> have<00:06:13.199> a<00:06:13.349> straight<00:06:13.770> line<00:06:14.069> I<00:06:14.310> think<00:06:14.639> if<00:06:14.729> I

00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:14.819 
don't have a straight line I think if I

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:16.580 
don't have a straight line I think if I
get<00:06:14.970> to<00:06:15.150> these<00:06:15.300> stylists<00:06:15.750> it's<00:06:15.900> kind<00:06:16.080> of<00:06:16.169> table

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:16.590 
get to these stylists it's kind of table

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:17.990 
get to these stylists it's kind of table
together<00:06:16.860> so<00:06:17.099> they<00:06:17.190> go<00:06:17.340> in<00:06:17.430> a<00:06:17.490> different<00:06:17.849> angle

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
together so they go in a different angle

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.879 
together so they go in a different angle
I<00:06:18.330> can<00:06:18.750> make<00:06:18.900> a<00:06:18.930> line<00:06:19.169> a<00:06:19.199> lot<00:06:19.379> straighter<00:06:19.740> and

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:19.889 
I can make a line a lot straighter and

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:21.920 
I can make a line a lot straighter and
I'll<00:06:20.039> panel<00:06:20.460> a<00:06:20.490> lot<00:06:20.729> better<00:06:21.030> but<00:06:21.690> then<00:06:21.840> you

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:21.930 
I'll panel a lot better but then you

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.899 
I'll panel a lot better but then you
have<00:06:22.080> pretty<00:06:22.289> much<00:06:22.379> you<00:06:22.830> can<00:06:22.979> hit<00:06:23.129> that<00:06:23.729> one

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:23.909 
have pretty much you can hit that one

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:25.939 
have pretty much you can hit that one
there<00:06:24.090> you<00:06:24.210> take<00:06:24.419> the<00:06:24.659> you<00:06:25.319> hit<00:06:25.710> the<00:06:25.830> right

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:25.949 
there you take the you hit the right

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:28.070 
there you take the you hit the right
trigger<00:06:26.159> I<00:06:26.340> have<00:06:26.490> my<00:06:26.580> camera<00:06:26.909> set<00:06:27.150> that's<00:06:27.870> for

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 
trigger I have my camera set that's for

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:34.700 
trigger I have my camera set that's for
the<00:06:28.169> video<00:06:28.469> for<00:06:30.319> the<00:06:31.319> trim<00:06:31.620> and<00:06:32.990> then<00:06:33.990> for<00:06:34.590> my

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
the video for the trim and then for my

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.550 
the video for the trim and then for my
map<00:06:34.949> that's<00:06:35.879> my<00:06:36.000> map<00:06:36.180> stops<00:06:36.479> working<00:06:36.719> you<00:06:37.440> got

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 
map that's my map stops working you got

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.080 
map that's my map stops working you got
to<00:06:37.650> play<00:06:37.770> with<00:06:37.800> it<00:06:38.069> sometimes<00:06:38.280> it<00:06:38.819> takes<00:06:39.030> a

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.090 
to play with it sometimes it takes a

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:40.760 
to play with it sometimes it takes a
little<00:06:39.180> bit<00:06:39.389> of<00:06:39.449> you<00:06:39.870> know<00:06:39.990> see<00:06:40.500> the<00:06:40.590> map

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:40.770 
little bit of you know see the map

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:43.070 
little bit of you know see the map
actually<00:06:41.060> wants<00:06:42.060> to<00:06:42.090> delete<00:06:42.690> it<00:06:42.810> it<00:06:42.930> when<00:06:43.050> I

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 
actually wants to delete it it when I

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.770 
actually wants to delete it it when I
did<00:06:43.289> the<00:06:43.440> other<00:06:43.560> thing<00:06:43.909> so<00:06:44.909> put<00:06:45.419> that<00:06:45.599> right

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:45.780 
did the other thing so put that right

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:46.189 
did the other thing so put that right
there

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:46.199 
there

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:48.439 
there
and<00:06:46.560> then<00:06:46.919> you<00:06:47.009> hit<00:06:47.129> the<00:06:47.310> button<00:06:47.340> so<00:06:48.150> you<00:06:48.210> put

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:48.449 
and then you hit the button so you put

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:50.809 
and then you hit the button so you put
the<00:06:48.569> button<00:06:48.949> like<00:06:49.949> I<00:06:50.039> just<00:06:50.099> drag<00:06:50.490> this<00:06:50.639> over

00:06:50.809 --> 00:06:50.819 
the button like I just drag this over

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:52.399 
the button like I just drag this over
here<00:06:51.150> put<00:06:51.539> it<00:06:51.629> to<00:06:51.750> where<00:06:51.900> you<00:06:51.990> want<00:06:52.199> it<00:06:52.289> and

then hit the button that you want to
select<00:06:54.030> and<00:06:54.360> it'll<00:06:54.539> select<00:06:54.780> it<00:06:54.990> up<00:06:55.080> there

00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:55.639 
select and it'll select it up there

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:59.330 
select and it'll select it up there
takes<00:06:56.639> it<00:06:56.789> back<00:06:56.909> out<00:06:57.180> and<00:06:58.169> see<00:06:58.770> now<00:06:59.009> the<00:06:59.069> map

00:06:59.330 --> 00:06:59.340 
takes it back out and see now the map

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.800 
takes it back out and see now the map
works<00:06:59.610> so<00:07:00.599> that's<00:07:01.020> pretty<00:07:01.259> much<00:07:01.349> my<00:07:01.500> basic

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:02.810 
works so that's pretty much my basic

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:06.620 
works so that's pretty much my basic

Nvidia<00:07:07.050> shield<00:07:07.550> when<00:07:08.550> I<00:07:08.580> first<00:07:08.819> got<00:07:09.000> this<00:07:09.180> I

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:09.330 
Nvidia shield when I first got this I

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:10.309 
Nvidia shield when I first got this I
thought<00:07:09.449> it<00:07:09.509> was<00:07:09.659> gonna<00:07:09.750> be<00:07:09.930> a<00:07:09.960> lot<00:07:10.259> more

00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:10.319 
thought it was gonna be a lot more

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:12.140 
thought it was gonna be a lot more
complicated<00:07:10.889> than<00:07:11.250> it<00:07:11.460> actually<00:07:11.610> is<00:07:11.880> it's

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:12.150 
complicated than it actually is it's

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.420 
complicated than it actually is it's
very<00:07:12.240> simple<00:07:12.779> to<00:07:12.990> do<00:07:13.139> just<00:07:13.770> remember<00:07:13.889> you<00:07:14.250> want

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:14.430 
very simple to do just remember you want

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:15.769 
very simple to do just remember you want
to<00:07:14.490> open<00:07:14.639> up<00:07:14.849> you<00:07:15.060> want<00:07:15.210> to<00:07:15.300> get<00:07:15.569> everything

00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:15.779 
to open up you want to get everything
