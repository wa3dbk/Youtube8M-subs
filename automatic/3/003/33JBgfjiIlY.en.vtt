00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
batter we have to add about 200 grams of

00:00:51.180 --> 00:01:03.460 
batter we have to add about 200 grams of
cleaned<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.870> cut<00:00:52.050> kaliesha<00:00:57.890> mix<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.070> well

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.350 

make<00:01:04.470> sure<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.980> coat<00:01:05.190> each<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.640> every<00:01:05.940> florid

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
make sure you coat each and every florid

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.170 
make sure you coat each and every florid
with<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.690> batter<00:01:06.870> mix<00:01:07.850> also<00:01:08.850> keep<00:01:09.030> in<00:01:09.150> mind

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
with the batter mix also keep in mind

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.380 
with the batter mix also keep in mind
that<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.660> batter<00:01:09.810> should<00:01:10.110> not<00:01:10.290> get<00:01:10.470> very<00:01:10.710> thin

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
that the batter should not get very thin

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.880 
that the batter should not get very thin
because<00:01:12.390> then<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.900> would<00:01:13.050> not<00:01:13.230> coat<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.680> very

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
because then it would not coat it very

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.700 
because then it would not coat it very
nicely<00:01:14.190> and<00:01:14.730> the<00:01:15.600> cauliflower<00:01:16.140> would<00:01:16.350> not<00:01:16.530> be

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
nicely and the cauliflower would not be

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.260 
nicely and the cauliflower would not be
very<00:01:16.800> crispy<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:18.020> I<00:01:19.020> think<00:01:19.610> our<00:01:20.610> oil<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.090> also

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
very crispy and I think our oil is also

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.260 
very crispy and I think our oil is also
very<00:01:21.540> hot<00:01:21.780> yes<00:01:22.700> so<00:01:23.700> we<00:01:23.790> will<00:01:23.880> put<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.120> for

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.890 
very hot yes so we will put it for
frying<00:01:24.920> make<00:01:25.920> sure<00:01:26.190> you<00:01:26.370> put<00:01:26.580> each<00:01:26.900> florets

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
frying make sure you put each florets

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:35.190
