looks great but just about any phone can
run<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.260> when<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.290> first<00:00:40.590> played<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.160> was<00:00:41.340> so

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
run it when I first played it I was so

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.690 
run it when I first played it I was so
hooked<00:00:41.970> I<00:00:42.090> seriously<00:00:42.510> did<00:00:42.870> not<00:00:42.900> move<00:00:43.700> fast

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700

moving<00:00:45.150> zombies<00:00:45.630> are<00:00:45.780> awesome<00:00:46.410> but<00:00:47.370> instead

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
moving zombies are awesome but instead

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.310 
moving zombies are awesome but instead
of<00:00:47.820> running<00:00:48.180> away<00:00:48.270> from<00:00:48.420> them<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:48.930> think<00:00:49.020> it's

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
of running away from them I think it's

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.080 
of running away from them I think it's
time<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.590> we<00:00:49.739> run<00:00:50.070> them<00:00:50.250> over<00:00:50.400> shoot<00:00:50.880> them

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
time that we run them over shoot them

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:58.540 
time that we run them over shoot them
and<00:00:51.270> watch<00:00:51.480> them<00:00:51.510> lick<00:00:51.900> their<00:00:52.080> own<00:00:52.260> death

restore them you can race people in drag
races<00:04:19.590> and<00:04:19.799> because<00:04:20.549> the<00:04:20.790> race<00:04:21.000> is<00:04:21.209> so<00:04:21.450> short

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
races and because the race is so short

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.800

the<00:04:22.410> distance<00:04:22.860> always<00:04:23.100> the<00:04:23.430> same<00:04:23.729> the<00:04:24.540> work

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.170 
to get the hang of them fairly quickly

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.770 
to get the hang of them fairly quickly
because<00:04:51.470> the<00:04:51.800> physics<00:04:52.280> stay<00:04:52.780> relatively

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
because the physics stay relatively

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.980 
because the physics stay relatively
consistent<00:04:54.620> and<00:04:54.800> so<00:04:55.550> usually<00:04:56.120> it<00:04:56.540> just<00:04:56.750> takes
