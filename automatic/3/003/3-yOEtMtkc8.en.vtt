miles<00:00:36.690> per<00:00:36.960> gallon<00:00:37.200> I'm<00:00:37.440> highways<00:00:37.920> up<00:00:38.129> by<00:00:38.489> 10

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
miles per gallon I'm highways up by 10

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.790 
miles per gallon I'm highways up by 10
miles<00:00:39.360> per<00:00:39.660> gallon<00:00:39.870> over<00:00:40.110> last<00:00:40.410> year's<00:00:40.710> model

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
miles per gallon over last year's model

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.270 
miles per gallon over last year's model
that's<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:42.000> huge<00:00:42.450> improvement<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:43.980> thought<00:00:44.219> I

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
that's a huge improvement so I thought I

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.709 
that's a huge improvement so I thought I
would<00:00:44.430> mention<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.940> couple<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.329> things<00:00:45.390> that

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
would mention a couple of things that

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.860 
would mention a couple of things that
Subaru<00:00:46.230> did<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:47.129> accomplish<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.629> first

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
Subaru did to accomplish that the first

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.569 
Subaru did to accomplish that the first
thing<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.350> they<00:00:49.559> took<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.800> two-point<00:00:50.399> own

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
thing is they took a two-point own

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.180 
thing is they took a two-point own
leader<00:00:50.960> boxer<00:00:51.960> engine<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.590> paired<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:53.039> with<00:00:53.070> a

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
leader boxer engine and paired it with a

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.729 
leader boxer engine and paired it with a
CVT<00:00:53.780> transmission<00:00:54.920> so<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.879> get<00:00:57.739> 148

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
CVT transmission so you get 148

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.799 
CVT transmission so you get 148
horsepower<00:00:58.770> out<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.699> this<00:00:59.940> engine<00:01:00.359> which<00:01:00.539> is

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
horsepower out of this engine which is

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.810 
horsepower out of this engine which is
notably<00:01:01.320> lower<00:01:01.710> than<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.100> was<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.460> former

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
notably lower than it was the former

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.910 
notably lower than it was the former
model<00:01:03.149> year<00:01:03.420> but<00:01:03.899> don't<00:01:04.110> be<00:01:04.170> alarmed<00:01:04.530> by<00:01:04.890> that

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
model year but don't be alarmed by that

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.789 
model year but don't be alarmed by that
you<00:01:05.580> get<00:01:05.760> up<00:01:05.880> from<00:01:05.909> 0<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.659> 60<00:01:07.200> much<00:01:07.500> quicker

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
you get up from 0 to 60 much quicker

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.120 
you get up from 0 to 60 much quicker
than<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.220> did<00:01:08.430> even<00:01:08.880> in<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.090> former<00:01:09.560> model<00:01:10.560> so

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
than you did even in the former model so

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.149 
than you did even in the former model so
you<00:01:11.189> get<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.820> best<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.299> both<00:01:12.360> worlds<00:01:13.159> ability

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
you get the best of both worlds ability

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.950 
you get the best of both worlds ability
to<00:01:14.189> get<00:01:14.490> up<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.820> go<00:01:14.939> as<00:01:15.119> quickly<00:01:15.360> as<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.780> need

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
to get up and go as quickly as you need

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.460

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
to and the fantastic gas mileage or with

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.719 
to and the fantastic gas mileage or with
the<00:01:19.590> security<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.070> knowing<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.520> you're<00:01:20.640> in

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
an all wheel drive vehicle so that leads

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.179 
an all wheel drive vehicle so that leads
me<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.820> my<00:01:23.850> second<00:01:24.570> most<00:01:24.750> favorite<00:01:24.960> thing<00:01:25.470> with

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
me to my second most favorite thing with

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.700 
me to my second most favorite thing with
these<00:01:26.400> new<00:01:26.700> technology<00:01:27.479> upgrades<00:01:27.990> in<00:01:28.350> the

these new technology upgrades in the
engine<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.159> transmission<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:30.090> also

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
engine and the transmission it also

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.859 
engine and the transmission it also
results<00:01:31.409> in<00:01:31.850> longer<00:01:32.850> mileage<00:01:33.299> between<00:01:33.720> your

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
results in longer mileage between your

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
year was every 3750 I'm going to point

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.399 
year was every 3750 I'm going to point
out<00:01:44.430> two<00:01:44.970> key<00:01:45.360> things<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.899> would<00:01:46.079> be<00:01:46.170> cost

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
out two key things that would be cost

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.260 
out two key things that would be cost
savings<00:01:46.860> for<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.159> when<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.399> do<00:01:47.610> come<00:01:47.850> in<00:01:48.030> for

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
savings for you when you do come in for

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.289 
savings for you when you do come in for
your<00:01:48.360> service<00:01:48.780> things<00:01:49.040> the<00:01:50.040> CVT<00:01:50.399> transmission

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
your service things the CVT transmission

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.210 
your service things the CVT transmission
is<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.450> sealed<00:01:51.780> unit<00:01:51.930> you'll<00:01:52.500> never<00:01:52.920> have<00:01:53.159> to

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
is a sealed unit you'll never have to

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.249 
is a sealed unit you'll never have to
flush<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:53.790> transmission<00:01:54.390> which<00:01:54.840> is<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.049> nice

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
flush that transmission which is a nice

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.749 
flush that transmission which is a nice
cost<00:01:55.649> savings<00:01:56.100> when<00:01:56.280> you're<00:01:56.399> thinking<00:01:56.700> about

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
cost savings when you're thinking about

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.370 
cost savings when you're thinking about
your<00:01:57.030> 30<00:01:57.270> 60<00:01:57.780> 90

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
your 30 60 90

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.490 
your 30 60 90
so<00:01:58.530> miles<00:01:58.740> service<00:01:59.219> intervals<00:01:59.729> and<00:02:00.229> also<00:02:01.229> this

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
so miles service intervals and also this

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.190 
so miles service intervals and also this
engine<00:02:01.860> design<00:02:01.890> is<00:02:02.490> now<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.299> timing<00:02:03.899> chain

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
engine design is now a timing chain

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.230 
engine design is now a timing chain
instead<00:02:04.829> of<00:02:05.039> a<00:02:05.100> timing<00:02:05.460> belt<00:02:05.490> so<00:02:05.939> you<00:02:05.969> won't

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
instead of a timing belt so you won't

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.029 
instead of a timing belt so you won't
have<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.539> worry<00:02:06.570> about<00:02:06.869> that<00:02:06.990> costly<00:02:07.590> timing

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
have to worry about that costly timing

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.570 
have to worry about that costly timing
belt<00:02:08.250> service<00:02:08.929> so<00:02:09.929> now<00:02:10.440> moving<00:02:10.800> forward<00:02:11.310> into

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
belt service so now moving forward into

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.720 
belt service so now moving forward into
the<00:02:11.610> cabin<00:02:12.209> I<00:02:12.860> would<00:02:13.860> really<00:02:14.099> like<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.489> talk<00:02:14.670> to
