00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
that's about it for the instruction

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:58.600 
that's about it for the instruction
manual<00:01:56.380> so<00:01:57.380> now<00:01:57.560> I'll<00:01:57.920> move<00:01:58.040> on<00:01:58.220> to<00:01:58.250> the<00:01:58.430> main

then over here is these two grabbing
arms<00:02:22.270> they<00:02:23.270> can<00:02:23.710> hold<00:02:25.030> these<00:02:26.030> crystals<00:02:27.460> we<00:02:28.460> get

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
arms they can hold these crystals we get

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.410 
arms they can hold these crystals we get
to<00:02:28.790> cool<00:02:29.210> growing<00:02:29.840> crystals<00:02:30.320> in<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:30.620> set

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
to cool growing crystals in the set

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.980 
to cool growing crystals in the set
there<00:02:32.420> you<00:02:32.480> go

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
this and you can also take off the main

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:45.679 
this and you can also take off the main
cockpit<00:03:39.829> and<00:03:40.829> connect<00:03:41.129> them<00:03:41.340> together<00:03:44.689> this

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:45.689 
cockpit and connect them together this

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:54.830 
cockpit and connect them together this
creates<00:03:46.200> a<00:03:46.319> really<00:03:46.709> cool<00:03:46.950> submarine<00:03:53.450> so<00:03:54.450> I'll

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
creates a really cool submarine so I'll

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.140 
creates a really cool submarine so I'll
put<00:03:55.079> it<00:03:55.230> back<00:03:55.739> together<00:03:56.010> again<00:03:56.280> I<00:03:59.150> think

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
put it back together again I think

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.809 
put it back together again I think
that's<00:04:00.480> about<00:04:00.599> all<00:04:00.750> for<00:04:00.900> this<00:04:01.200> set<00:04:01.500> so<00:04:02.459> please
