line here it's good to practice hand
separately<00:02:07.250> that<00:02:07.400> really<00:02:07.940> helps<00:02:08.270> do<00:02:08.780> it

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
separately that really helps do it

separately and then put it together if

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.680 
separately and then put it together if
it's<00:02:10.340> too<00:02:10.490> difficult<00:02:10.670> for<00:02:11.000> you<00:02:11.180> to<00:02:11.330> put<00:02:11.600> it

flap<00:02:29.030> way<00:02:29.780> up<00:02:29.930> here<00:02:30.200> and<00:02:30.410> then<00:02:31.160> gfg<00:02:32.950> in<00:02:33.950> a<00:02:34.250> C<00:02:38.470> and

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
flap way up here and then gfg in a C and

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.390 
flap way up here and then gfg in a C and
then<00:02:39.980> F<00:02:41.560> we're<00:02:42.560> going<00:02:42.590> to<00:02:42.770> play<00:02:42.860> that<00:02:43.010> F<00:02:43.190> again

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
then F we're going to play that F again

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.130 
then F we're going to play that F again
and<00:02:43.910> roll<00:02:44.090> it<00:02:44.239> down<00:02:44.770> so<00:02:45.770> F<00:02:46.070> D<00:02:46.610> flat<00:02:47.000> D<00:02:47.030> flat<00:02:47.270> this

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
and roll it down so F D flat D flat this

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.020 
and roll it down so F D flat D flat this
key<00:02:48.380> is<00:02:48.530> in<00:02:48.650> for<00:02:48.950> flats<00:02:49.280> if<00:02:49.489> you're<00:02:49.640> wondering

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
the way to here to finish the phrase out

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.370 
the way to here to finish the phrase out
so<00:04:50.920> why<00:04:51.040> don't<00:04:51.220> we<00:04:51.280> finish<00:04:51.490> that<00:04:51.639> phrase<00:04:52.090> out

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
so why don't we finish that phrase out

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.480 
so why don't we finish that phrase out
I'm<00:04:53.380> going<00:04:53.560> to<00:04:53.590> check<00:04:53.800> the<00:04:53.919> time<00:04:54.130> because<00:04:54.400> I

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
I'm going to check the time because I

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.790 
I'm going to check the time because I
don't<00:04:54.669> like<00:04:54.790> the<00:04:54.940> lessons<00:04:55.360> to<00:04:55.510> go<00:04:55.690> too<00:04:56.560> long<00:04:56.770> I

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
don't like the lessons to go too long I

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.770 
don't like the lessons to go too long I
think<00:04:56.980> it's<00:04:57.340> good<00:04:57.610> to<00:04:57.639> do<00:04:57.940> little<00:04:58.600> bitty

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
think it's good to do little bitty

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:04.140 
think it's good to do little bitty
chunks<00:04:59.260> at<00:04:59.380> a<00:04:59.410> time<00:04:59.639> and<00:05:00.840> ah<00:05:02.880> you<00:05:03.880> know<00:05:04.000> no

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
chunks at a time and ah you know no

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.110 
chunks at a time and ah you know no
longer<00:05:04.180> than<00:05:04.570> 10<00:05:04.810> minutes<00:05:05.130> as<00:05:06.130> I<00:05:06.400> say<00:05:06.669> so

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
longer than 10 minutes as I say so

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.850 
longer than 10 minutes as I say so
let's<00:05:07.510> continue<00:05:07.720> on<00:05:08.110> let's<00:05:08.350> do<00:05:08.620> these<00:05:08.800> two

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
let's continue on let's do these two

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.980 
let's continue on let's do these two
measures<00:05:09.490> here<00:05:09.690> D<00:05:12.180> actually<00:05:13.180> this<00:05:13.450> right<00:05:13.780> here

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
measures here D actually this right here

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.140 
measures here D actually this right here
is<00:05:14.080> a<00:05:14.110> finishing<00:05:14.919> off<00:05:15.220> this<00:05:15.460> measures<00:05:15.940> what

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
is a finishing off this measures what

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:25.680 
is a finishing off this measures what
that<00:05:16.330> is<00:05:17.040> to<00:05:18.040> see<00:05:22.800> then<00:05:23.800> we<00:05:23.919> have<00:05:24.100> a<00:05:24.130> core<00:05:24.690> three

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
that is to see then we have a core three

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.620 
that is to see then we have a core three
notes<00:05:25.900> at<00:05:26.080> once<00:05:26.160> B<00:05:27.160> flat<00:05:27.520> E<00:05:27.790> flat<00:05:27.880> a<00:05:28.180> G<00:05:28.330> all

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
notes at once B flat E flat a G all

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.200 
notes at once B flat E flat a G all
together<00:05:29.400> there<00:05:30.400> okay

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
together there okay

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.159 
together there okay
that<00:05:31.720> can't<00:05:31.960> we're<00:05:32.080> going<00:05:32.200> to<00:05:32.260> have<00:05:32.440> a<00:05:33.870> low<00:05:34.870> E

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:35.169 
that can't we're going to have a low E

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:41.280 
that can't we're going to have a low E
flat<00:05:35.729> to<00:05:36.729> B<00:05:36.910> flat<00:05:37.350> to<00:05:38.350> E<00:05:38.380> flat<00:05:39.930> okay<00:05:40.930> and<00:05:41.169> then

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:41.290 
flat to B flat to E flat okay and then

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.379 
flat to B flat to E flat okay and then
we're<00:05:41.380> going<00:05:41.470> to<00:05:41.530> go<00:05:41.710> even<00:05:41.830> lower<00:05:42.160> low<00:05:42.880> E<00:05:42.910> flat

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:43.389 
we're going to go even lower low E flat

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:45.570 
we're going to go even lower low E flat
a<00:05:43.810> flat

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
a flat

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.290 
a flat
to<00:05:46.580> an<00:05:46.639> e-flat<00:05:46.910> octave<00:05:49.060> okay

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.300 
to an e-flat octave okay

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.240 
to an e-flat octave okay
so<00:05:50.600> hands<00:05:50.960> together<00:05:51.260> right<00:05:51.860> there<00:05:52.040> on<00:05:52.160> those

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
so hands together right there on those

00:05:52.250 --> 00:06:01.239 
so hands together right there on those
two<00:05:52.520> measures<00:05:52.970> we<00:05:53.090> have<00:05:53.270> this<00:05:53.419> really<00:05:53.780> slowly

00:06:01.239 --> 00:06:01.249 

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:03.889 

do<00:06:02.249> that<00:06:02.429> again<00:06:02.549> for<00:06:02.939> you<00:06:03.119> actually<00:06:03.509> let<00:06:03.839> me

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:03.899 
do that again for you actually let me

00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:05.179 
do that again for you actually let me
start<00:06:04.199> here<00:06:04.469> because<00:06:04.559> that's<00:06:04.829> the<00:06:05.039> beginning

00:06:05.179 --> 00:06:05.189 
start here because that's the beginning

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:06.589 
start here because that's the beginning
of<00:06:05.519> the<00:06:05.579> measure<00:06:05.819> so<00:06:06.029> I'm<00:06:06.119> going<00:06:06.329> to<00:06:06.359> start

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:06.599 
of the measure so I'm going to start

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:20.980 
of the measure so I'm going to start
here<00:06:06.689> okay<00:06:07.109> here<00:06:07.859> we<00:06:07.979> go

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:20.990 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.070 

and<00:06:21.990> then<00:06:22.110> actually<00:06:22.470> going<00:06:22.590> to<00:06:22.680> hold<00:06:22.950> that<00:06:24.080> for

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 
and then actually going to hold that for
