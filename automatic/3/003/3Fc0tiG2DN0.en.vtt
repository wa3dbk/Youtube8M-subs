00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.860 

this<00:00:10.830> tool<00:00:11.130> was<00:00:11.370> developed<00:00:11.429> as<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:12.179> progression

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
this tool was developed as a progression

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.110 
this tool was developed as a progression
from<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.440> texturing<00:00:14.040> tool<00:00:14.309> we<00:00:14.730> looked<00:00:14.969> at

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
from the texturing tool we looked at

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.099 
from the texturing tool we looked at
earlier<00:00:16.789> compared<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.060> basic<00:00:18.480> texturing

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
earlier compared to the basic texturing

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.769 
earlier compared to the basic texturing
tool<00:00:19.350> when<00:00:20.130> we<00:00:20.279> incorporate<00:00:20.609> spiraling<00:00:21.600> into

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
tool when we incorporate spiraling into

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.410 
tool when we incorporate spiraling into
our<00:00:22.050> work<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.949> tool<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.460> changed<00:00:23.970> in<00:00:24.150> two<00:00:24.420> ways

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
our work the tool is changed in two ways

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.240 
our work the tool is changed in two ways
firstly<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:28.019> will<00:00:28.199> be<00:00:28.349> impossible<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.980> hold

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
firstly it will be impossible to hold

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.999 
firstly it will be impossible to hold
the<00:00:29.490> tool<00:00:29.699> freehand<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.599> guarantee<00:00:31.470> holding

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
the tool freehand and guarantee holding

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.900 
the tool freehand and guarantee holding
the<00:00:32.160> tool<00:00:32.369> at<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.700> same<00:00:32.969> angle<00:00:33.239> all<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:34.320> time

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
the tool at the same angle all the time

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.030 
the tool at the same angle all the time
to<00:00:35.910> overcome<00:00:36.180> this<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.870> tool<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.620> fitted<00:00:38.010> with

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
to overcome this the tool is fitted with

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.709 
to overcome this the tool is fitted with
a<00:00:38.190> cradle<00:00:40.280> the<00:00:41.280> cradle<00:00:41.730> allows<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.270> tool<00:00:42.480> to

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
a cradle the cradle allows the tool to

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.619 
a cradle the cradle allows the tool to
be<00:00:42.809> adjusted<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.590> locked<00:00:44.460> into<00:00:44.730> one<00:00:45.120> fixed

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
be adjusted and locked into one fixed

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.330 
be adjusted and locked into one fixed
position<00:00:47.600> by<00:00:48.600> placing<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:49.289> cradle<00:00:49.829> onto<00:00:50.219> the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
position by placing this cradle onto the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.790 
position by placing this cradle onto the
tool<00:00:50.550> rest<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.600> increased<00:00:52.079> surface<00:00:52.379> area

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
tool rest the increased surface area

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.459 
tool rest the increased surface area
means<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.820> tool<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.239> better<00:00:54.480> supported<00:00:55.230> and
