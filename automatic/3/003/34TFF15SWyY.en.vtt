00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
which is run through several betas and

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.190 
which is run through several betas and
it's<00:01:05.189> gonna<00:01:05.369> be<00:01:05.640> officially<00:01:06.150> announced<00:01:06.990> very

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
soon but taking a closer look at this

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.630 
soon but taking a closer look at this
picture<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.530> can<00:01:10.560> see<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.070> there's<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.310> ring

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
picture you can see that there's a ring

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.330 
picture you can see that there's a ring
around<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.150> home<00:01:12.330> button<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.869> now<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:14.070> is

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
around the home button and now that is

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.399 
around the home button and now that is
very<00:01:14.490> interesting<00:01:15.390> because<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:16.229> could

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
very interesting because that could

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.039 
very interesting because that could
actually<00:01:16.590> be<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.159> fingerprint<00:01:17.759> scanner<00:01:18.049> or

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
actually be the fingerprint scanner or

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.010 
actually be the fingerprint scanner or
it<00:01:19.170> could<00:01:19.320> be<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.619> LED<00:01:20.130> notifications<00:01:21.060> that

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
it could be the LED notifications that

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.179 
it could be the LED notifications that
the<00:01:22.619> iPhone<00:01:23.130> finally<00:01:23.970> might<00:01:24.180> have<00:01:24.950> now<00:01:25.950> Apple

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
the iPhone finally might have now Apple

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.090 
the iPhone finally might have now Apple
has<00:01:26.369> implemented<00:01:27.060> LED<00:01:27.689> notifications<00:01:28.560> but

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
has implemented LED notifications but

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.219 
has implemented LED notifications but
with<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.369> flash<00:01:29.700> on<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.689> back<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.110> device

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
with the flash on the back of the device

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.109 
with the flash on the back of the device
and<00:01:31.680> that's<00:01:31.829> not<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.189> best<00:01:32.340> way<00:01:32.549> for<00:01:32.759> LED

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
and that's not the best way for LED

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.090 
and that's not the best way for LED
notifications<00:01:33.930> because<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.799> don't<00:01:34.950> want

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
notifications because you don't want

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.030 
notifications because you don't want
that<00:01:35.280> flashing<00:01:36.060> eye<00:01:36.299> out<00:01:37.259> on<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.650> back<00:01:37.860> of

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
that flashing eye out on the back of

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.319 
that flashing eye out on the back of
your<00:01:38.189> phone<00:01:38.430> you'd<00:01:38.610> rather<00:01:38.729> have<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.090> on<00:01:39.180> the

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
your phone you'd rather have it on the

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.990 
your phone you'd rather have it on the
front<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:40.470> this<00:01:40.770> would<00:01:40.950> be<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.100> perfect<00:01:41.579> LED

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
front so this would be a perfect LED

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.389 
front so this would be a perfect LED
notification<00:01:42.150> light<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:43.680> lights<00:01:44.009> up<00:01:44.220> or

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
notification light that lights up or

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.880 
notification light that lights up or
ring<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.329> illuminates<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.710> would<00:01:46.799> be

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
ring and it illuminates it that would be

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.910 
ring and it illuminates it that would be
very<00:01:47.070> nice<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.399> see<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:49.170> would<00:01:49.320> be<00:01:49.500> much

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
very nice to see and that would be much

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.450 
very nice to see and that would be much
better<00:01:50.180> and<00:01:51.200> all<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.590> other<00:01:52.770> mainstream

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
better and all the other mainstream

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.940 
better and all the other mainstream
phones<00:01:54.180> except<00:01:54.780> for<00:01:54.960> iPhones<00:01:55.409> have<00:01:55.470> LED

maybe<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.660> would<00:02:09.840> be<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:09.989> same<00:02:10.319> for<00:02:10.349> the

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
maybe that would be the same for the

maybe that would be the same for the
iPhone<00:02:11.099> 5s<00:02:11.400> or<00:02:12.300> it<00:02:12.750> could<00:02:12.900> possibly<00:02:13.080> be

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
iPhone 5s or it could possibly be

iPhone 5s or it could possibly be
the<00:02:14.100> redesign<00:02:14.580> home<00:02:14.850> button<00:02:15.210> with<00:02:15.660> a

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
the redesign home button with a

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.320 
the redesign home button with a
fingerprint<00:02:16.290> sensor<00:02:16.500> where<00:02:17.180> remember<00:02:18.180> your

fingerprint sensor where remember your

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.510 
fingerprint sensor where remember your
fingerprint<00:02:19.020> and<00:02:19.260> you<00:02:19.980> can<00:02:20.130> just<00:02:20.310> easily

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
fingerprint and you can just easily

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.640 
fingerprint and you can just easily
unlock<00:02:20.880> from<00:02:21.090> there<00:02:21.390> but<00:02:22.080> you<00:02:22.230> can<00:02:22.380> clearly

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
unlock from there but you can clearly

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.350 
unlock from there but you can clearly
see<00:02:22.800> that<00:02:23.160> there's<00:02:23.340> a<00:02:23.400> ring<00:02:23.670> around<00:02:23.820> the<00:02:24.120> box

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
see that there's a ring around the box

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.710 
see that there's a ring around the box
and<00:02:24.960> it's<00:02:25.260> way<00:02:25.380> too<00:02:25.440> obvious<00:02:25.940> to<00:02:26.940> just<00:02:27.210> be<00:02:27.420> a

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
and it's way too obvious to just be a

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.870 
and it's way too obvious to just be a
little<00:02:28.230> feature<00:02:28.440> it<00:02:29.130> must<00:02:29.340> be<00:02:29.490> something<00:02:29.730> big

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
little feature it must be something big

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.960 
little feature it must be something big
that<00:02:30.330> Apple<00:02:30.630> will<00:02:30.750> be<00:02:30.900> announcing<00:02:31.410> so<00:02:32.340> it<00:02:32.580> is<00:02:32.760> a
