I<00:03:37.600> see<00:03:37.810> what<00:03:38.290> do<00:03:38.380> you<00:03:38.440> think<00:03:38.620> of<00:03:38.770> those

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
I see what do you think of those

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.710 
I see what do you think of those
conditions<00:03:39.370> are<00:03:39.520> we<00:03:39.700> alright<00:03:42.720> being

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
conditions are we alright being

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.990 
conditions are we alright being
accomplished<00:03:44.290> right<00:03:44.530> now<00:03:44.739> I<00:03:45.250> think<00:03:45.670> that's

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
accomplished right now I think that's

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.020 
accomplished right now I think that's
what<00:03:46.300> was<00:03:46.450> holding<00:03:46.780> up<00:03:47.610> against<00:03:48.610> the<00:03:48.850> pressure

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
what was holding up against the pressure

00:03:49.030 --> 00:04:46.590 
what was holding up against the pressure
on<00:03:49.330> the<00:03:49.420> fire<00:03:49.630> I<00:03:49.660> think

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.830 

we<00:04:47.600> have<00:04:47.840> four<00:04:48.790> that<00:04:49.790> are<00:04:49.850> involved<00:04:50.450> in<00:04:50.540> the

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
we have four that are involved in the

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.350 
we have four that are involved in the
attic<00:04:51.200> of<00:04:51.470> all<00:04:51.860> four<00:04:52.220> units<00:04:52.610> in<00:04:52.760> this<00:04:52.850> complex

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
attic of all four units in this complex

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.470 
attic of all four units in this complex
I<00:04:54.070> got<00:04:55.070> down<00:04:55.250> a<00:04:55.310> strike<00:04:55.520> a<00:04:55.580> third<00:04:55.910> alarm<00:04:56.030> and

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
I got down a strike a third alarm and

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.810 
I got down a strike a third alarm and
then<00:04:57.350> I<00:04:57.920> have<00:04:58.640> protein<00:04:59.090> 21<00:04:59.480> common<00:05:00.820> licorice

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
then I have protein 21 common licorice

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:28.880 
then I have protein 21 common licorice
