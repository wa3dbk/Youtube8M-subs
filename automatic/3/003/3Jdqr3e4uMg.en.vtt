00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
you're looking it's not really going

you're looking it's not really going
very<00:03:12.099> far<00:03:12.400> where<00:03:13.030> is<00:03:13.209> this<00:03:13.390> guy<00:03:13.720> it's<00:03:14.650> a<00:03:14.829> pretty

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
very far where is this guy it's a pretty

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
significant turn it's much wider so you

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:19.589 
significant turn it's much wider so you
have<00:03:18.430> to<00:03:18.579> take<00:03:18.760> that<00:03:18.879> it<00:03:19.000> consists<00:03:19.299> into

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
have to take that it consists into
