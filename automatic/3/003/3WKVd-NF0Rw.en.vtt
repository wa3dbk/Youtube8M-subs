00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.119 
watches and we'll only see it grow I
would<00:01:04.110> imagine<00:01:04.260> especially<00:01:04.500> if<00:01:04.860> there's<00:01:05.010> a

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
would imagine especially if there's a

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.399 
would imagine especially if there's a
version<00:01:05.850> two<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.360> 360<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.170> be<00:01:07.290> out

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
version two of the 360 to be out

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.380 
version two of the 360 to be out
sometime<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:07.979> year<00:01:08.040> I'm<00:01:08.909> sure<00:01:08.970> they're

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
sometime this year I'm sure they're

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.090 
sometime this year I'm sure they're
gonna<00:01:09.510> go<00:01:09.720> moto<00:01:10.020> maker<00:01:10.200> out<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.860> out<00:01:10.979> of

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
gonna go moto maker out of the out of

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.399 
gonna go moto maker out of the out of
the<00:01:11.159> gate<00:01:11.400> there<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.990> odd<00:01:13.170> thing<00:01:13.380> is

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
the gate there so the odd thing is

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.929 
the gate there so the odd thing is
though<00:01:13.710> if<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:13.920> go<00:01:14.010> moto<00:01:14.250> maker<00:01:14.430> it's<00:01:14.729> still

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
though if you go moto maker it's still

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.910 
though if you go moto maker it's still
250<00:01:15.570> for<00:01:15.750> this<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.110> if<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.380> go<00:01:16.500> buy<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.680> moto

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
250 for this and if you go buy a moto

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.980 
250 for this and if you go buy a moto
360<00:01:17.159> from<00:01:17.580> Google<00:01:18.060> Play<00:01:18.240> or<00:01:18.270> Best<00:01:18.600> Buy<00:01:18.750> it's

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
360 from Google Play or Best Buy it's

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.770 
360 from Google Play or Best Buy it's
170<00:01:19.619> 180<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.670> would<00:01:21.090> hope<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.330> Motorola

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
170 180 so I would hope that Motorola

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.420 
170 180 so I would hope that Motorola
will<00:01:22.140> think<00:01:22.320> about<00:01:22.380> dropping<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.159> price

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
will think about dropping that price

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.219 
will think about dropping that price
soon<00:01:23.729> either<00:01:24.090> way<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.720> can<00:01:24.840> customize<00:01:24.960> a

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
soon either way you can customize a

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.770 
soon either way you can customize a
watch<00:01:25.470> it's<00:01:25.799> kind<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.220> cool<00:01:26.400> so<00:01:26.640> we've<00:01:27.570> got

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
watch it's kind of cool so we've got

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.590 
watch it's kind of cool so we've got

stainless steel watch band so when this

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.100 
stainless steel watch band so when this
device<00:02:05.250> was<00:02:05.490> initially<00:02:06.090> unveiled<00:02:06.299> months<00:02:06.960> and

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
device was initially unveiled months and

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.760 
device was initially unveiled months and
months<00:02:07.200> ago<00:02:07.700> it<00:02:08.700> was<00:02:08.879> shown<00:02:09.149> with<00:02:09.450> leather<00:02:09.929> and

months ago it was shown with leather and

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.710 
months ago it was shown with leather and
this<00:02:11.160> band<00:02:11.460> actually<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.030> believe<00:02:12.180> was<00:02:12.450> just

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
this band actually I believe was just

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.030 
this band actually I believe was just
this<00:02:12.870> band<00:02:13.110> initially<00:02:13.380> and<00:02:13.740> then<00:02:13.830> we<00:02:13.920> found

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
this band initially and then we found

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.220 
this band initially and then we found
out<00:02:14.220> about<00:02:14.340> leather<00:02:14.640> later<00:02:14.910> on<00:02:15.090> so<00:02:15.630> this<00:02:16.050> was

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
out about leather later on so this was

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.390 
out about leather later on so this was
the<00:02:16.320> band<00:02:16.500> but<00:02:16.590> then<00:02:16.740> once<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.190> device

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400

it's<00:03:00.270> available<00:03:00.480> to<00:03:00.930> buy<00:03:01.140> so<00:03:01.470> it's<00:03:01.620> like

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
it's available to buy so it's like

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.400 
it's available to buy so it's like

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.010 
out how to make enough efficiently not
really<00:03:55.800> sure<00:03:55.920> what<00:03:56.100> the<00:03:56.220> deal<00:03:56.340> was<00:03:56.610> there<00:03:56.850> but

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
really sure what the deal was there but

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:02.000 
really sure what the deal was there but
we've<00:03:58.020> got<00:03:58.170> one<00:03:58.290> in<00:03:58.410> hand<00:03:58.650> and<00:04:00.590> it<00:04:01.590> looks<00:04:01.830> great

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
we've got one in hand and it looks great

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.190 
we've got one in hand and it looks great
so<00:04:02.459> if<00:04:02.790> you<00:04:02.970> were<00:04:03.060> hoping<00:04:03.209> for<00:04:03.420> the<00:04:03.630> mono<00:04:03.840> link

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
so if you were hoping for the mono link

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.090 
so if you were hoping for the mono link
I<00:04:04.440> think<00:04:04.700> your<00:04:05.700> time<00:04:05.910> may<00:04:06.209> have<00:04:06.240> passed

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
I think your time may have passed

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.140 
I think your time may have passed
hopefully<00:04:08.100> they<00:04:08.220> bring<00:04:08.430> it<00:04:08.550> back<00:04:08.700> maybe<00:04:08.940> with

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
hopefully they bring it back maybe with

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.020 
hopefully they bring it back maybe with
the<00:04:09.270> next<00:04:09.570> version<00:04:09.810> of<00:04:10.170> the<00:04:10.230> 360<00:04:11.220> because<00:04:11.880> I

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
the next version of the 360 because I

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.160 
the next version of the 360 because I
think<00:04:12.090> a<00:04:12.270> lot<00:04:12.420> of<00:04:12.450> people<00:04:12.720> probably<00:04:12.810> want<00:04:13.050> to

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
think a lot of people probably want to

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.810 
think a lot of people probably want to
get<00:04:13.290> their<00:04:13.380> hands<00:04:13.650> on<00:04:13.709> this<00:04:13.860> so<00:04:14.070> and<00:04:14.520> it<00:04:14.700> was
