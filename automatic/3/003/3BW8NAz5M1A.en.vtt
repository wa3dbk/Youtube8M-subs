some scabs on it and just say you take a
chisel<00:01:59.080> and<00:01:59.259> you<00:01:59.320> chisel<00:01:59.770> the<00:01:59.860> scabs<00:02:00.159> off<00:02:00.490> it

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
chisel and you chisel the scabs off it

chisel and you chisel the scabs off it
and<00:02:01.150> you<00:02:01.270> go<00:02:01.390> ahead<00:02:01.509> and<00:02:01.689> spray<00:02:01.960> the<00:02:02.140> rhino

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
and you go ahead and spray the rhino

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.069 
and you go ahead and spray the rhino
lining<00:02:03.250> on<00:02:03.430> it<00:02:03.579> okay<00:02:04.329> it's<00:02:04.479> gonna<00:02:04.600> look<00:02:04.840> good

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
lining on it okay it's gonna look good

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:08.309 
lining on it okay it's gonna look good
okay<00:02:05.860> but<00:02:06.670> this<00:02:06.790> is<00:02:07.000> the<00:02:07.030> deal

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
okay but this is the deal

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.369 
okay but this is the deal
you're<00:02:08.590> still<00:02:08.860> going<00:02:09.039> over<00:02:09.759> the<00:02:10.329> top<00:02:10.539> of<00:02:10.810> there

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:11.379 
you're still going over the top of there

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.630 
you're still going over the top of there
rust<00:02:12.510> okay<00:02:13.620> so<00:02:14.620> is<00:02:14.709> what's<00:02:14.890> gonna<00:02:15.040> happen<00:02:15.520> is

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
rust okay so is what's gonna happen is

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.100 
rust okay so is what's gonna happen is
if<00:02:15.760> there's<00:02:15.970> any<00:02:16.030> moisture<00:02:16.360> inside<00:02:16.870> of<00:02:17.020> that

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
if there's any moisture inside of that

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.910 
if there's any moisture inside of that
rust<00:02:17.700> rust<00:02:18.700> press<00:02:19.120> okay

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
rust rust press okay

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.360 
rust rust press okay
moisture<00:02:20.940> oxygen<00:02:21.940> salt<00:02:22.660> all<00:02:23.470> causes<00:02:23.830> rust<00:02:24.220> to

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
moisture oxygen salt all causes rust to

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.120 
moisture oxygen salt all causes rust to
spread<00:02:25.170> so<00:02:26.170> if<00:02:26.230> you<00:02:26.350> don't<00:02:26.500> have<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.770> vehicle

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
spread so if you don't have the vehicle

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.970 
spread so if you don't have the vehicle
on<00:02:27.220> a<00:02:27.310> clean<00:02:27.760> dry<00:02:27.790> place<00:02:28.390> in<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:29.590> vehicle

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
on a clean dry place in the vehicle

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.220 
on a clean dry place in the vehicle
isn't<00:02:30.160> clean<00:02:30.730> I<00:02:30.970> mean<00:02:31.510> wiping<00:02:32.020> the<00:02:32.110> whole

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
isn't clean I mean wiping the whole

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.309 
isn't clean I mean wiping the whole
thing<00:02:32.500> down<00:02:32.940> say<00:02:33.940> like<00:02:34.150> taking<00:02:34.480> 320<00:02:35.020> grit

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
thing down say like taking 320 grit

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.770 
thing down say like taking 320 grit
sandpaper<00:02:35.709> and<00:02:36.330> sanding<00:02:37.330> the<00:02:37.450> whole<00:02:37.600> vehicle

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
sandpaper and sanding the whole vehicle

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.390 
sandpaper and sanding the whole vehicle
down<00:02:38.230> okay

down okay

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.390 
down okay
if<00:02:39.489> you<00:02:39.760> don't<00:02:40.120> if<00:02:40.390> you<00:02:40.540> don't<00:02:40.569> prep<00:02:41.050> it<00:02:41.290> in<00:02:42.160> my

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
if you don't if you don't prep it in my

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.650 
if you don't if you don't prep it in my
opinion<00:02:42.790> that<00:02:42.940> stuff's<00:02:43.180> gonna<00:02:43.360> peel<00:02:43.630> off

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
opinion that stuff's gonna peel off

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.180 
opinion that stuff's gonna peel off
eventually<00:02:44.230> okay

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
eventually okay

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.309 
eventually okay
it<00:02:45.310> may<00:02:45.520> not<00:02:45.760> I've<00:02:46.030> never<00:02:46.330> personally<00:02:46.600> used<00:02:47.110> it

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
it may not I've never personally used it

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.160 
it may not I've never personally used it
this<00:02:47.800> is<00:02:47.950> just<00:02:48.220> me<00:02:49.000> thinking<00:02:49.180> as<00:02:49.480> a<00:02:49.569> painter

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
this is just me thinking as a painter

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.860 
this is just me thinking as a painter
if<00:02:50.380> you<00:02:50.590> don't<00:02:50.770> prep<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.190> surface<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:52.660> pain

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
if you don't prep the surface the pain

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.290 
if you don't prep the surface the pain
is<00:02:53.050> not<00:02:53.200> going<00:02:53.440> to<00:02:53.500> stick<00:02:53.739> to<00:02:53.950> it<00:02:53.980> so<00:02:54.700> is<00:02:55.090> what<00:02:55.269> I

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
is not going to stick to it so is what I

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.930 
is not going to stick to it so is what I
will<00:02:55.570> do<00:02:55.780> if<00:02:56.440> you<00:02:56.650> if<00:02:56.830> you<00:02:57.010> really<00:02:57.370> insist<00:02:57.580> on

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
the thing in repair the rust is if you

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.720 
the thing in repair the rust is if you
would<00:03:04.209> if<00:03:04.810> you're<00:03:05.019> gonna<00:03:05.230> paint<00:03:05.530> it<00:03:05.709> go<00:03:06.519> ahead

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
would if you're gonna paint it go ahead

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.790 
would if you're gonna paint it go ahead
and<00:03:06.850> put<00:03:07.030> a<00:03:07.060> good<00:03:07.209> primer<00:03:07.569> on<00:03:07.840> it<00:03:08.050> and<00:03:08.200> then<00:03:08.769> go

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
and put a good primer on it and then go

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.380 
and put a good primer on it and then go
ahead<00:03:09.130> and<00:03:09.700> use<00:03:10.030> the<00:03:10.269> the<00:03:11.230> bedliner<00:03:11.620> okay<00:03:12.400> if

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
ahead and use the the bedliner okay if

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.479 
ahead and use the the bedliner okay if
you<00:03:13.569> do<00:03:13.780> not<00:03:13.989> if<00:03:14.440> you're<00:03:14.769> just<00:03:15.130> going<00:03:15.400> over

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
you do not if you're just going over

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.250 
you do not if you're just going over
like<00:03:15.790> little<00:03:16.120> pinholes<00:03:16.510> things<00:03:16.780> like<00:03:16.989> that

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
like little pinholes things like that

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.990 
like little pinholes things like that
that<00:03:17.650> moisture<00:03:18.069> still<00:03:18.280> gonna<00:03:18.489> get<00:03:18.670> in<00:03:18.790> there

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
that moisture still gonna get in there

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.699 
that moisture still gonna get in there
and<00:03:19.209> it's<00:03:19.569> gonna<00:03:19.690> rot<00:03:19.989> on<00:03:20.140> the<00:03:20.230> back<00:03:20.410> side<00:03:20.650> of

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
and it's gonna rot on the back side of

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.949 
and it's gonna rot on the back side of
that<00:03:20.830> steel<00:03:21.160> here<00:03:21.370> now<00:03:21.519> we're<00:03:21.670> gonna<00:03:21.819> see<00:03:22.810> it

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
that steel here now we're gonna see it

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.350 
that steel here now we're gonna see it
the<00:03:23.530> bedliner<00:03:23.860> is<00:03:24.010> gonna<00:03:24.220> hold<00:03:24.430> together<00:03:24.610> okay

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
the bedliner is gonna hold together okay

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.289 
the bedliner is gonna hold together okay
it<00:03:25.630> dries<00:03:25.900> -<00:03:26.140> like<00:03:26.290> a<00:03:26.320> real<00:03:26.590> thick<00:03:26.860> plastic

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
it dries - like a real thick plastic

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.150 
it dries - like a real thick plastic
okay<00:03:28.299> so<00:03:28.360> it's<00:03:28.600> gonna<00:03:28.739> appear<00:03:29.739> that<00:03:29.950> there's

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
okay so it's gonna appear that there's

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.530 
okay so it's gonna appear that there's
nothing<00:03:30.549> going<00:03:30.700> on<00:03:30.940> it's<00:03:31.120> gonna<00:03:31.180> look<00:03:31.480> like

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
nothing going on it's gonna look like

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.470 
nothing going on it's gonna look like
the<00:03:31.870> vehicle<00:03:32.290> is<00:03:32.500> is<00:03:32.860> holding<00:03:33.280> up<00:03:33.430> well<00:03:33.670> but<00:03:34.390> if

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
the vehicle is is holding up well but if

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.000 
the vehicle is is holding up well but if
you<00:03:34.510> get<00:03:34.720> on<00:03:34.840> the<00:03:34.989> back<00:03:35.200> side<00:03:35.500> of<00:03:35.530> that<00:03:35.739> panel

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
you get on the back side of that panel

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.490 
you get on the back side of that panel
where<00:03:36.310> it<00:03:36.400> wasn't<00:03:36.579> treated<00:03:37.180> okay<00:03:37.690> and<00:03:38.230> the

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
where it wasn't treated okay and the

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.220 
where it wasn't treated okay and the
rust<00:03:38.709> has<00:03:38.860> already<00:03:39.160> started<00:03:39.660> it's<00:03:40.660> probably

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
rust has already started it's probably

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.819 
rust has already started it's probably
going<00:03:41.380> to<00:03:41.500> spread<00:03:42.480> okay<00:03:43.480> but<00:03:44.260> if<00:03:44.350> you<00:03:44.470> do<00:03:44.680> it

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
going to spread okay but if you do it

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:45.390 
going to spread okay but if you do it
let<00:03:45.010> me<00:03:45.040> know

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
let me know

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.160 
let me know
I'll<00:03:45.730> send<00:03:46.060> me<00:03:46.180> a<00:03:46.209> video<00:03:46.390> about<00:03:46.810> it<00:03:46.989> because

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
I'll send me a video about it because

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.020 
I'll send me a video about it because
