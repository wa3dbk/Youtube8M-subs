00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:11.900 

let's<00:02:04.350> see<00:02:04.469> we<00:02:04.619> make<00:02:04.799> it

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:21.710 

so<00:02:12.780> did<00:02:12.900> I<00:02:13.020> actually<00:02:14.960> house

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:31.860 

thermostats<00:02:22.720> real<00:02:22.900> hard<00:02:23.080> to<00:02:23.170> fire<00:02:23.319> to<00:02:30.870> the

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
thermostats real hard to fire to the

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.030 
thermostats real hard to fire to the
elevator<00:02:32.170> shafts<00:02:32.379> right<00:02:32.650> there<00:02:32.860> and<00:02:32.950> they

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
elevator shafts right there and they

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.910 
elevator shafts right there and they
have<00:02:33.129> a<00:02:33.190> window<00:02:33.519> running<00:02:33.819> down<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.120> building

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
have a window running down the building

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.699 
have a window running down the building
so<00:02:35.920> I'm<00:02:35.980> really<00:02:36.099> if<00:02:36.280> they<00:02:36.370> moved<00:02:36.970> it<00:02:37.150> back<00:02:37.709> okay

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
so I'm really if they moved it back okay

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.060 
so I'm really if they moved it back okay
I<00:02:38.739> guess<00:02:38.890> it's<00:02:39.010> my<00:02:39.099> turn<00:02:39.160> that's<00:02:39.819> it
