00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 a day this is broken for you and in this 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.690
 video i want to talk to you about how 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.230
 raise your worth to the eyes of a man 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.360
 I am often in training consultations 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.820
 and even hen parties and girls and women 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.830
 ask about how to do so 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.140
 to make a man appreciate more because 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.390
 there is a sense to like 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.970
 underestimate know as if that 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.550
 do for relationships and men are not 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.830
 sees does not notice arise such 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.900
 feeling as if maybe 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.239
 own uselessness and even when 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.030
 you are not in a relationship yet and only think 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.570
 about wanting a family relationship 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.879
 the idea that you will be underestimated 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.250
 she can block so much 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.500
 this transition to the state to look there 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.149
 men and so on and in this video want 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.550
 share with you what is possible 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.250
 do up to to raise your prices in 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.800
 the eyes of another person and most importantly 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.809
 where do you need to start this remember about 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.629
 tom and what you probably heard many times 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:04.199
 about the fact that you initially have nature 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.480
 already prices like these flowers 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.600
 they are already priced 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.700
 like butterflies and so why are you all something 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.040
 given by nature she already have some 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.740
 steel prices so that you are not needed yes it 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.680
 you would not have been 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.690
 understanding of what its price is yes it is 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.170
 what forms your base in confidence 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.260
 people 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:28.100
 your personality traits are your personal 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:31.130
 qualities what others like you 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.400
 people are your strengths and this 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.560
 need to strengthened even that is basic 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.990
 true to herself it is not formed by 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.450
 you start building up and 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.310
 the quality of which you lack and your 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.500
 weaknesses in the parade in the rest 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.510
 pull up even the ocean throw from 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.150
 the fact that you reinforce what is already 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.040
 strong win because when to play 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.740
 your field is empty what you have is good 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:59.540
 it turns out to do it even better and so 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:03.530
 realizing that you really are pricing 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.620
 you have something that makes you better than her 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.020
 yourself nice to chat interesting then 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.910
 the next step is not just this 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.950
 understanding but also broadcast outside 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.480
 so many girls and women who 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.950
 considers himself attractive smart 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.959
 talented but they like it not 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.640
 show the world that is, nobody knows about 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.990
 tom what you have a rich inner view 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.940
 because he is with you 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.830
 i don't you tell him to anyone well either 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.370
 some very very limited circle 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.990
 people 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.220
 accordingly the following is difficult 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:37.520
 learn to make it show off 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.800
 broadcast what you prices and here 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.960
 it is necessary to take into account the moment that 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.480
 every person he will catch 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:48.050
 this is your and transmitting such a factor 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.300
 bands of mine because people appreciate too 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.490
 important and if stabbed for one man 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.490
 it is important that you for example be good 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.410
 hostess and you'll be there is broadcasting it 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:00.350
 shows that you know how to cook 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:02.300
 what you follow is conceived there and then 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.210
 then another man may be more 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:08.240
 important for example that you know how 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:12.260
 give emotional comfort 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:14.720
 listen talk heart to heart support 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.600
 idea to inspire a man and for him it 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:21.080
 will be more valuable than some like cast 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.270
 borscht and sheer shirt and you need not 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.730
 just broadcast it all and everything 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.790
 in a row and you selectively understand what 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.860
 it is important for man to show that it is you 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.360
 there is no betraying you here 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.130
 only a small nuance is not necessary 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.780
 show what is not and do not need 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.560
 coming up with a great hostess 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.120
 if you hate just standing at the stove 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.220
 here is the next factor you need 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.110
 consider that this may change 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.370
 depending on the situation ottawa 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:52.250
 those relationships so even if you 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.440
 very bad hostess something about it 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:58.040
 no need to talk too since such 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.200
 to manifest one's disadvantage because 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.240
 possible to with some particular 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.880
 like a man like to learn 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:08.150
 cook and will be happy therefore 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.310
 we broadcast what is valuable for this 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.470
 man is not everything but what is the purpose and 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:16.769
 accordingly capture the following that 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:18.919
 you need to learn how to highlight 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.440
 ignore other people what they are 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:23.340
 but let's talk about this in other videos 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.710
 so again 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.500
 to catch the eye you still need 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.960
 start by checking yourself the concept 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.449
 property 2 learn to show it 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.860
 so that people notice 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:36.860
 cover want to say
