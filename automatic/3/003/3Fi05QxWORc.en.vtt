so<00:00:34.879> once<00:00:35.750> you've<00:00:35.930> got<00:00:36.199> that<00:00:36.500> going<00:00:36.640> here's

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
so once you've got that going here's

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.100 
so once you've got that going here's
what<00:00:37.820> it<00:00:37.910> probably<00:00:38.360> at<00:00:38.449> first<00:00:38.720> was<00:00:38.870> going<00:00:39.019> to

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
what it probably at first was going to

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.049 
what it probably at first was going to
sound<00:00:39.320> like<00:00:39.440> especially<00:00:40.370> if<00:00:40.489> you're<00:00:40.640> really

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
sound like especially if you're really

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:42.759 
sound like especially if you're really
practicing<00:00:41.600> the<00:00:41.690> way<00:00:41.809> you<00:00:41.870> should<00:00:42.230> which<00:00:42.559> is

00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:42.769 
practicing the way you should which is

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:57.670 
practicing the way you should which is
clean<00:00:43.400> and<00:00:43.790> slow<00:00:55.480> it's<00:00:56.480> getting<00:00:56.870> there<00:00:57.019> but

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
clean and slow it's getting there but

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.709 
clean and slow it's getting there but
it's<00:00:57.800> not<00:00:57.890> exactly<00:00:58.460> the<00:00:58.550> exciting<00:00:59.149> music<00:00:59.510> we

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
it's not exactly the exciting music we

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:00.759 
it's not exactly the exciting music we
would<00:00:59.840> like<00:00:59.960> to<00:00:59.989> be<00:01:00.170> thinking<00:01:00.469> we're<00:01:00.590> going<00:01:00.710> to

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
would like to be thinking we're going to

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.869 
would like to be thinking we're going to
be<00:01:00.859> playing<00:01:01.690> eventually<00:01:03.160> just<00:01:04.160> be<00:01:04.369> hard<00:01:04.580> for

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
be playing eventually just be hard for

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.160 
be playing eventually just be hard for
you<00:01:05.030> but<00:01:05.360> you're<00:01:05.479> going<00:01:05.630> to<00:01:05.690> be<00:01:05.810> going<00:01:05.960> like

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
you but you're going to be going like

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.460 
you but you're going to be going like
this<00:01:06.850> once<00:01:07.850> that<00:01:08.090> automatic<00:01:08.840> pilot<00:01:09.259> really

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
this once that automatic pilot really

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.040 
this once that automatic pilot really
kicks<00:01:09.920> in<00:01:10.190> the<00:01:10.700> thumb<00:01:11.060> has<00:01:11.270> to<00:01:11.420> be<00:01:11.509> going<00:01:11.660> on<00:01:11.929> an

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
kicks in the thumb has to be going on an

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.109 
kicks in the thumb has to be going on an
automatic<00:01:12.530> pilot<00:01:12.860> and<00:01:13.250> after<00:01:13.580> a<00:01:13.610> while<00:01:13.789> even

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
automatic pilot and after a while even

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.419 
automatic pilot and after a while even
the<00:01:14.630> fingers<00:01:14.869> and<00:01:15.350> this<00:01:15.590> very<00:01:15.890> repetitious

00:01:16.419 --> 00:01:16.429 
the fingers and this very repetitious

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:19.410 
the fingers and this very repetitious
pattern<00:01:17.030> are<00:01:17.720> going<00:01:18.110> on<00:01:18.259> an<00:01:18.410> automatic<00:01:18.830> pilot

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
pattern are going on an automatic pilot

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.820 
pattern are going on an automatic pilot
you<00:01:20.420> can<00:01:20.450> tell<00:01:20.750> this<00:01:20.840> automatic<00:01:21.320> pilot<00:01:21.619> for<00:01:21.740> me

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
you can tell this automatic pilot for me

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.310 
you can tell this automatic pilot for me
because<00:01:22.039> I'm<00:01:22.160> talking<00:01:22.610> while<00:01:22.729> I'm<00:01:22.820> doing<00:01:23.090> it

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
because I'm talking while I'm doing it

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.580 
because I'm talking while I'm doing it
now<00:01:24.320> at<00:01:25.070> some<00:01:25.850> point<00:01:26.140> an<00:01:27.140> interesting

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
now at some point an interesting

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.140 
now at some point an interesting
psychological<00:01:27.829> thing<00:01:28.549> happens<00:01:28.909> when<00:01:29.030> you

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
psychological thing happens when you

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.030 
psychological thing happens when you
listen<00:01:29.329> to<00:01:29.600> it<00:01:29.750> because<00:01:30.350> it<00:01:30.500> really<00:01:30.710> starts

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
listen to it because it really starts

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.469 
listen to it because it really starts
sounding<00:01:31.220> like<00:01:31.579> music

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
sounding like music

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.380 
sounding like music
we're<00:01:33.170> getting<00:01:33.500> there<00:01:33.909> there's<00:01:34.909> a<00:01:35.000> lot<00:01:35.270> of

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
we're getting there there's a lot of

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.990 
we're getting there there's a lot of
practice<00:01:35.810> in<00:01:35.960> between<00:01:36.320> and<00:01:36.710> that<00:01:37.460> practice

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
practice in between and that practice

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.120 
practice in between and that practice
has<00:01:38.149> got<00:01:38.360> to<00:01:38.509> be<00:01:38.630> stressing<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:39.680> fact<00:01:39.890> that

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
has got to be stressing the fact that

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.760 
has got to be stressing the fact that
the<00:01:40.250> thumb<00:01:40.610> can't<00:01:41.299> drop<00:01:41.780> out<00:01:42.110> in<00:01:42.439> other<00:01:42.590> words

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
the thumb can't drop out in other words

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.740 
the thumb can't drop out in other words
there's<00:01:42.920> a<00:01:42.979> real<00:01:43.130> temptation<00:01:43.399> to<00:01:44.210> play<00:01:44.450> to

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
there's a real temptation to play to

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.200 
there's a real temptation to play to
fast<00:01:45.079> and<00:01:45.439> the<00:01:45.860> thumbs<00:01:46.159> sort<00:01:46.490> of<00:01:46.579> whatever

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
fast and the thumbs sort of whatever

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.149 
fast and the thumbs sort of whatever
we're<00:01:47.990> hitting<00:01:48.259> notes<00:01:48.439> they<00:01:48.679> may<00:01:48.799> not<00:01:48.950> be<00:01:49.039> the

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
we're hitting notes they may not be the

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:50.740 
we're hitting notes they may not be the
right<00:01:49.280> one<00:01:49.490> but<00:01:49.759> we'll<00:01:50.119> catch<00:01:50.299> up<00:01:50.329> without

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
right one but we'll catch up without

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.020 
right one but we'll catch up without
eventually<00:01:51.200> what<00:01:51.679> I<00:01:51.710> just<00:01:51.979> said<00:01:52.189> is<00:01:52.369> not<00:01:52.759> the

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
eventually what I just said is not the

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.639 
eventually what I just said is not the
way<00:01:53.149> to<00:01:53.179> practice<00:01:53.479> it's<00:01:53.929> really<00:01:53.990> important<00:01:54.560> to

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
way to practice it's really important to

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.230 
way to practice it's really important to
make<00:01:54.799> sure<00:01:55.179> this<00:01:57.189> right-hand<00:01:58.189> thumb<00:01:58.549> is

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
make sure this right-hand thumb is

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.840 
make sure this right-hand thumb is
always<00:01:59.329> together<00:02:00.110> let's<00:02:00.829> not<00:02:01.009> go<00:02:01.189> any<00:02:01.369> faster

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
always together let's not go any faster

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.669 
always together let's not go any faster
than<00:02:01.880> that<00:02:02.299> keeping<00:02:02.899> that<00:02:02.990> right<00:02:03.170> hand<00:02:03.409> come

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:03.679 
than that keeping that right hand come

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:08.320 
than that keeping that right hand come
together<00:02:03.829> it<00:02:04.759> is<00:02:05.299> possible<00:02:05.720> to<00:02:05.750> do<00:02:05.990> now<00:02:07.330> what

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
together it is possible to do now what

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.670 
together it is possible to do now what
we<00:02:08.450> would<00:02:08.569> like<00:02:08.869> to<00:02:09.049> be<00:02:09.170> able<00:02:09.289> to<00:02:09.440> do<00:02:09.649> is<00:02:10.130> put<00:02:10.489> a

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
we would like to be able to do is put a

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.020 
we would like to be able to do is put a
bunch<00:02:12.680> of<00:02:12.860> those<00:02:13.010> patterns<00:02:13.310> together<00:02:13.670> we've

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
bunch of those patterns together we've

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.940 
bunch of those patterns together we've
only<00:02:14.209> got<00:02:14.390> one<00:02:14.420> we've<00:02:15.049> really<00:02:15.380> worked<00:02:15.500> fairly

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
only got one we've really worked fairly

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.680 
only got one we've really worked fairly
hard<00:02:16.160> here<00:02:16.400> we<00:02:16.549> still<00:02:16.760> only<00:02:16.940> have<00:02:17.030> one<00:02:17.360> pattern

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
hard here we still only have one pattern

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.630 
hard here we still only have one pattern
the<00:02:18.230> right<00:02:18.440> hand<00:02:18.680> patterns<00:02:19.099> for<00:02:19.310> the<00:02:19.400> three

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
the right hand patterns for the three

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.660 
the right hand patterns for the three
chords<00:02:20.000> that<00:02:20.150> we<00:02:20.239> worked<00:02:20.450> on<00:02:20.660> are<00:02:21.380> very<00:02:21.670> very

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
chords that we worked on are very very

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.370 
chords that we worked on are very very
similar<00:02:23.060> the<00:02:23.329> only<00:02:23.540> thing<00:02:23.720> really<00:02:23.840> happening

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
similar the only thing really happening

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.350 
similar the only thing really happening
is<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.650> thumb<00:02:24.860> has<00:02:25.010> been<00:02:25.160> instructed<00:02:25.519> what

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
is the thumb has been instructed what

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.970 
is the thumb has been instructed what
like<00:02:26.510> we<00:02:26.630> said<00:02:26.810> before<00:02:27.170> to<00:02:27.560> do<00:02:27.709> slightly

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
like we said before to do slightly

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.160 
like we said before to do slightly
different<00:02:28.130> bass<00:02:28.519> notes<00:02:28.790> for<00:02:29.000> each<00:02:29.030> chord<00:02:29.450> but

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
different bass notes for each chord but

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.199 
different bass notes for each chord but
there's<00:02:30.829> a<00:02:30.920> million<00:02:31.130> different<00:02:31.400> patterns<00:02:31.970> and

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
there's a million different patterns and

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.089 
there's a million different patterns and
that's<00:02:33.079> what<00:02:33.230> we're<00:02:33.319> going<00:02:33.440> to<00:02:33.470> be<00:02:33.620> doing<00:02:33.769> in

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
that's what we're going to be doing in

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:35.800 
that's what we're going to be doing in
our<00:02:34.190> next<00:02:34.250> lesson<00:02:34.819> we're<00:02:35.450> going<00:02:35.630> to<00:02:35.690> be

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
our next lesson we're going to be

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.140 
our next lesson we're going to be
looking<00:02:35.959> at<00:02:36.260> other<00:02:36.500> ways<00:02:36.769> while<00:02:37.459> the<00:02:37.670> thumb<00:02:37.970> is

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
looking at other ways while the thumb is

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.690 
looking at other ways while the thumb is
still<00:02:38.359> doing<00:02:38.630> the<00:02:38.720> very<00:02:38.900> same<00:02:38.959> thing<00:02:39.519> that<00:02:40.519> the

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
still doing the very same thing that the

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.720 
still doing the very same thing that the
fingers<00:02:41.269> can<00:02:41.420> be<00:02:41.480> doing<00:02:41.840> different<00:02:42.730> different

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
fingers can be doing different different

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.580 
fingers can be doing different different
orders<00:02:44.090> different<00:02:44.450> kind<00:02:44.660> of<00:02:44.690> permutations<00:02:45.470> of

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
orders different kind of permutations of

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.539 
orders different kind of permutations of
of<00:02:46.459> where<00:02:47.120> it<00:02:47.299> strikes<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:48.380> net<00:02:48.709> result

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
of where it strikes the net result

00:02:49.549 --> 00:03:20.650 
of where it strikes the net result
eventually<00:02:49.700> will<00:02:50.510> be<00:02:50.660> something

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.200 

that's<00:03:21.560> gonna<00:03:21.740> be<00:03:21.890> a<00:03:21.920> little<00:03:22.100> ways<00:03:22.280> off<00:03:22.310> but

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210 
that's gonna be a little ways off but

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.600 
that's gonna be a little ways off but
we're<00:03:23.810> definitely<00:03:24.080> on<00:03:24.440> that<00:03:24.470> trail<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.370> next

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
we're definitely on that trail the next

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:26.710 
we're definitely on that trail the next
little<00:03:25.790> couple<00:03:26.150> of<00:03:26.240> steps<00:03:26.480> are<00:03:26.630> actually

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
little couple of steps are actually

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.360 
little couple of steps are actually
gonna<00:03:26.960> be<00:03:27.050> quite<00:03:27.260> fun<00:03:27.560> because<00:03:27.980> they're<00:03:28.280> gonna

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
gonna be quite fun because they're gonna

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.700 
gonna be quite fun because they're gonna
get<00:03:28.550> us<00:03:28.700> a<00:03:28.850> lot<00:03:29.180> closer<00:03:29.540> to<00:03:29.720> being<00:03:30.290> able<00:03:30.410> to<00:03:30.530> do

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:30.710 
get us a lot closer to being able to do
