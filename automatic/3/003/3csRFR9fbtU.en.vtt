00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:26.950 
just set up the build in there

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.390

what

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
what

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:35.330 
what
so<00:00:28.820> let's<00:00:29.420> just<00:00:29.510> go<00:00:29.630> ahead

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.200 

the<00:00:35.610> reasons<00:00:36.060> don't<00:00:36.270> work

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
the reasons don't work

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.290 
the reasons don't work
hazard<00:00:38.210> finger<00:00:38.540> half<00:00:38.720> hazard<00:00:39.230> we're<00:00:39.890> sort<00:00:40.130> of

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
hazard finger half hazard we're sort of

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.920 
hazard finger half hazard we're sort of
arbitrarily<00:00:41.350> making<00:00:42.350> the<00:00:42.500> approach

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
arbitrarily making the approach

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.620 
arbitrarily making the approach
nah

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:46.630 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.680 

well<00:00:46.960> kind<00:00:47.740> of

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.779 

out<00:00:50.750> the<00:00:51.020> window<00:00:51.170> a<00:00:51.379> long<00:00:51.620> time<00:00:51.890> ago<00:00:52.010> and<00:00:52.489> let

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
out the window a long time ago and let

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.330 
out the window a long time ago and let
the<00:00:52.910> composition<00:00:53.480> come<00:00:53.719> to<00:00:53.870> you<00:00:53.960> as<00:00:54.140> you<00:00:54.320> go<00:00:54.350> so

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
the composition come to you as you go so

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.900 
the composition come to you as you go so
that's<00:00:55.550> what<00:00:55.699> we<00:00:55.850> do<00:00:56.059> so

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.100 

building<00:01:01.910> in<00:01:02.000> the<00:01:02.090> background<00:01:02.300> and<00:01:02.840> that's

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
building in the background and that's

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.020 
building in the background and that's
sort<00:01:03.350> of<00:01:03.380> the<00:01:03.500> sky<00:01:03.800> so<00:01:04.430> I'm<00:01:04.520> kind<00:01:04.880> of<00:01:04.910> working

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
sort of the sky so I'm kind of working

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.360 
sort of the sky so I'm kind of working
the<00:01:05.270> negative<00:01:05.780> with<00:01:06.290> a<00:01:06.320> lot<00:01:06.560> of<00:01:06.590> block<00:01:06.980> and

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.370 
the negative with a lot of block and

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.490 
the negative with a lot of block and
then<00:01:07.760> put<00:01:07.970> some<00:01:08.150> glue<00:01:08.390> in<00:01:08.570> that<00:01:08.750> block<00:01:08.990> and

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
then put some glue in that block and

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.750 
then put some glue in that block and
cutting<00:01:09.890> is<00:01:09.980> one<00:01:10.160> with<00:01:10.370> a<00:01:10.430> little<00:01:10.610> bit<00:01:10.700> of

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
cutting is one with a little bit of

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.620 
cutting is one with a little bit of
wider<00:01:11.090> that's<00:01:11.420> if<00:01:12.080> you<00:01:12.290> can<00:01:12.550> it<00:01:13.550> actually<00:01:13.760> stay

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
wider that's if you can it actually stay

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.020 
wider that's if you can it actually stay
away<00:01:14.870> from<00:01:14.930> all<00:01:15.290> altogether<00:01:16.130> the<00:01:16.340> black<00:01:16.580> color

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
away from all altogether the black color

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.550 
away from all altogether the black color
if<00:01:17.270> you<00:01:17.330> can't<00:01:17.600> try<00:01:17.750> to<00:01:17.810> make<00:01:17.990> your<00:01:18.080> own<00:01:18.230> black

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
if you can't try to make your own black

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.550 
if you can't try to make your own black
if<00:01:18.740> you<00:01:18.770> can<00:01:19.240> mixing<00:01:20.240> like<00:01:20.420> a<00:01:20.450> lizard<00:01:20.720> crimson

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.590 

it<00:01:24.560> serene<00:01:24.860> blue<00:01:24.980> and<00:01:25.310> then<00:01:25.460> agreeing<00:01:25.880> usually

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
it serene blue and then agreeing usually

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.810 
it serene blue and then agreeing usually
a<00:01:26.630> fail<00:01:26.900> or<00:01:27.110> green<00:01:27.350> is<00:01:27.500> a<00:01:27.530> better<00:01:27.770> green<00:01:28.220> now

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
a fail or green is a better green now

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.600 
a fail or green is a better green now
right<00:01:29.060> now<00:01:29.210> I'm<00:01:29.240> using<00:01:29.480> ASAP<00:01:30.340> sappy<00:01:31.340> green

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
right now I'm using ASAP sappy green

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.060 
right now I'm using ASAP sappy green
which<00:01:32.330> doesn't<00:01:32.960> quite<00:01:33.050> do<00:01:33.350> the<00:01:33.470> job<00:01:33.740> we're
