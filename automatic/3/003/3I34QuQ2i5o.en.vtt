is<00:00:35.030> one<00:00:35.180> thing<00:00:35.330> I<00:00:35.510> kind<00:00:35.750> of<00:00:35.809> figured<00:00:36.470> out<00:00:36.590> I

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
is one thing I kind of figured out I

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.130 
is one thing I kind of figured out I
personally<00:00:37.130> learned<00:00:37.940> them<00:00:38.180> on<00:00:38.330> flat<00:00:38.750> ground

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
personally learned them on flat ground

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.740 
personally learned them on flat ground
they<00:00:39.980> actually<00:00:40.640> could<00:00:40.940> be<00:00:41.090> more<00:00:41.270> difficult<00:00:41.450> on

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
they actually could be more difficult on

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.840 
they actually could be more difficult on
flat<00:00:41.989> ground<00:00:42.260> and<00:00:42.410> into<00:00:42.500> a<00:00:42.590> small<00:00:42.860> Bank<00:00:43.160> flat

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
flat ground and into a small Bank flat

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:44.920 
flat ground and into a small Bank flat
ground<00:00:44.090> kind<00:00:44.239> of<00:00:44.330> gives<00:00:44.450> you<00:00:44.510> the<00:00:44.629> confidence

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
ground kind of gives you the confidence

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.500 
ground kind of gives you the confidence
because<00:00:45.309> literally<00:00:46.309> nothing<00:00:46.520> could<00:00:46.850> go<00:00:47.000> wrong

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
because literally nothing could go wrong

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.180 
because literally nothing could go wrong
you<00:00:47.660> just<00:00:47.840> put<00:00:47.989> a<00:00:48.020> foot<00:00:48.260> down<00:00:48.290> that's<00:00:49.070> the

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
you just put a foot down that's the

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.950 
you just put a foot down that's the
weird<00:00:49.550> thing<00:00:49.610> about<00:00:49.760> caveman's<00:00:50.390> though<00:00:50.600> the

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
weird thing about caveman's though the

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.900 
weird thing about caveman's though the
bigger<00:00:51.230> they<00:00:51.829> get<00:00:52.070> the<00:00:52.310> easier<00:00:52.730> they<00:00:52.880> are

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
bigger they get the easier they are

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.240 
bigger they get the easier they are
they're<00:00:53.480> just<00:00:53.720> obviously<00:00:54.260> more<00:00:54.500> scary<00:00:54.920> when

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250

one if you can get over the bike because
landing<00:01:56.270> like<00:01:56.479> this<00:01:56.900> feels<00:01:57.680> a<00:01:57.799> lot<00:01:57.920> better

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
landing like this feels a lot better

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.100 
landing like this feels a lot better
than<00:01:58.400> landing<00:01:58.700> like<00:01:58.850> this<00:01:59.060> you<00:01:59.780> can<00:01:59.869> do<00:01:59.930> it<00:01:59.960> on

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
than landing like this you can do it on

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.420 
than landing like this you can do it on
the<00:02:00.200> flat<00:02:00.380> ground<00:02:00.650> you<00:02:00.830> can<00:02:01.010> almost<00:02:01.159> do<00:02:01.400> it

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
the flat ground you can almost do it

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.670 
the flat ground you can almost do it
into<00:02:01.670> anything<00:02:01.970> like<00:02:02.299> I<00:02:02.390> said<00:02:02.630> as<00:02:02.780> weird<00:02:03.500> as<00:02:03.619> it

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
into anything like I said as weird as it

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.770 
into anything like I said as weird as it
sounds<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:04.850> smaller<00:02:05.180> ones<00:02:05.450> are<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:05.630> more

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
sounds the smaller ones are the more

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:06.999 
sounds the smaller ones are the more
difficult<00:02:05.900> ones<00:02:06.350> because<00:02:06.680> you<00:02:06.740> have<00:02:06.830> to<00:02:06.920> do

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
difficult ones because you have to do

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.100 
difficult ones because you have to do
them<00:02:07.159> quickly<00:02:07.520> the<00:02:07.850> nose<00:02:08.330> cab<00:02:08.570> is<00:02:08.750> still<00:02:08.959> there

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
them quickly the nose cab is still there

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.330 
them quickly the nose cab is still there
it's<00:02:09.350> still<00:02:09.530> relevant<00:02:09.769> you're<00:02:10.070> still<00:02:10.220> out

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
it's still relevant you're still out

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.500 
it's still relevant you're still out
here<00:02:12.040> banks<00:02:13.040> are<00:02:13.220> definitely<00:02:13.820> easier<00:02:14.000> than

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
here banks are definitely easier than

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.600 
here banks are definitely easier than
quarters<00:02:14.959> caveman's<00:02:15.560> you<00:02:15.739> typically<00:02:16.070> do<00:02:16.280> drop

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
quarters caveman's you typically do drop

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.759 
quarters caveman's you typically do drop
a<00:02:16.640> little<00:02:16.910> bit<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:17.329> if<00:02:18.110> you<00:02:18.170> do<00:02:18.260> not<00:02:18.380> a<00:02:18.440> quarter

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
a little bit and if you do not a quarter

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:19.960 
a little bit and if you do not a quarter
especially<00:02:19.250> see<00:02:19.430> point<00:02:19.579> you're<00:02:19.730> just<00:02:19.760> gonna

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
especially see point you're just gonna

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.699 
especially see point you're just gonna
drop<00:02:20.150> to<00:02:20.329> flat<00:02:20.540> first<00:02:21.019> I<00:02:21.170> would<00:02:21.320> say<00:02:21.440> after<00:02:21.560> you

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
drop to flat first I would say after you

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:22.930 
drop to flat first I would say after you
get<00:02:21.829> them<00:02:21.920> off<00:02:22.010> flat<00:02:22.190> ground<00:02:22.430> just<00:02:22.579> do<00:02:22.700> it<00:02:22.790> into

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
get them off flat ground just do it into

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.270 
get them off flat ground just do it into
a<00:02:22.970> bank<00:02:23.180> like<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:23.510> deck<00:02:23.720> into<00:02:23.959> a<00:02:24.049> bank<00:02:24.230> well<00:02:25.160> go

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
do one over there again it's not the end

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.720 
do one over there again it's not the end
of<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:27.650> world<00:02:27.800> if<00:02:27.980> you<00:02:28.069> just<00:02:28.190> let<00:02:28.400> go<00:02:28.550> your
