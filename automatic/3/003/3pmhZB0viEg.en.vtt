slightly different you know the

slightly different you know the
production<00:01:03.149> car<00:01:03.329> got<00:01:03.480> slightly<00:01:03.690> narrower<00:01:04.110> a

to<00:01:07.590> go<00:01:07.710> forward<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.159> little<00:01:08.280> bit<00:01:08.400> to

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
to go forward a little bit to

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.310 
to go forward a little bit to
accommodate<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.270> zeta<00:01:09.479> architecture<00:01:10.140> and

accommodate the zeta architecture and

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.109 
accommodate the zeta architecture and
the<00:01:10.350> wheelbase<00:01:10.950> got<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.340> little<00:01:11.640> longer<00:01:11.820> when

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
the wheelbase got a little longer when

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.510 
the wheelbase got a little longer when
we<00:01:12.330> wanted<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.780> pursue<00:01:13.260> an<00:01:13.560> engineering

and<00:01:21.810> talk<00:01:22.560> about<00:01:22.860> are<00:01:22.979> we<00:01:23.070> compromising<00:01:23.759> the

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
and talk about are we compromising the

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.120 
and talk about are we compromising the
theme<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.450> we<00:01:24.600> always<00:01:24.780> go<00:01:25.200> back<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.470> forth<00:01:25.830> and

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
theme so we always go back and forth and

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.249 
engineers take a look at the show car
what<00:01:29.490> we<00:01:29.640> can<00:01:29.820> do<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.270> achieve<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.750> look<00:01:31.020> and

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
what we can do to achieve that look and

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.319 
what we can do to achieve that look and
get<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.950> essence<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.610> put<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:32.939> into<00:01:33.090> this

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329

there's<00:02:00.240> an<00:02:00.420> appropriate<00:02:01.049> balance<00:02:01.229> between

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
the design and the performance so I

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.899 
the design and the performance so I
think<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.409> we've<00:02:04.560> done<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.770> great<00:02:05.070> job<00:02:05.100> not

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
think that we've done a great job not

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.940 
think that we've done a great job not
only<00:02:05.939> balancing<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.960> concept<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.829> the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
only balancing the concept to the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.889 
only balancing the concept to the
production<00:02:08.340> we<00:02:08.970> ended<00:02:09.239> up<00:02:09.330> with<00:02:09.509> being<00:02:09.720> able

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
production we ended up with being able

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.240 
production we ended up with being able
to<00:02:10.050> execute<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.560> car<00:02:10.770> that<00:02:11.009> looks

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
to execute a car that looks

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.490 
to execute a car that looks
fantastically<00:02:12.239> like<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.660> concept

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
fantastically like the concept

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.960 
fantastically like the concept
but<00:02:14.400> performs<00:02:14.910> like<00:02:15.120> no<00:02:15.420> other<00:02:15.660> car
