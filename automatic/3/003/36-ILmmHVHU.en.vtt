00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
my sister had quite a few things that

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.740 
my sister had quite a few things that
way<00:01:15.800> there<00:01:15.980> expired<00:01:16.430> or<00:01:16.760> she<00:01:16.910> just<00:01:17.090> never<00:01:17.330> used

way there expired or she just never used

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.380 
way there expired or she just never used
so<00:01:18.440> we<00:01:18.710> pitched<00:01:19.040> a<00:01:19.310> whole<00:01:19.490> bunch<00:01:19.700> of<00:01:19.820> those<00:01:20.000> and

freed up a lot of space and now

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.750 
freed up a lot of space and now
everything<00:01:33.410> looks<00:01:33.440> really<00:01:34.130> great

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
everything looks really great

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.640 
everything looks really great
again<00:01:35.120> there's<00:01:35.420> tons<00:01:35.750> of<00:01:35.900> storage<00:01:36.260> in<00:01:36.470> this

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
again there's tons of storage in this

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.410 
again there's tons of storage in this
small<00:01:36.890> bathroom<00:01:37.340> so<00:01:37.520> that<00:01:37.670> really<00:01:37.940> wasn't<00:01:38.150> her

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
small bathroom so that really wasn't her

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.030 
small bathroom so that really wasn't her
problem<00:01:38.870> it<00:01:39.020> was<00:01:39.110> mostly<00:01:39.410> just<00:01:39.680> getting<00:01:39.950> rid

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
problem it was mostly just getting rid

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.250 
problem it was mostly just getting rid
of<00:01:40.100> things<00:01:40.340> that<00:01:40.640> she<00:01:40.820> never<00:01:40.970> used<00:01:41.360> which<00:01:42.080> i

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
of things that she never used which i

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.020 
of things that she never used which i
think<00:01:42.350> is<00:01:42.650> a<00:01:42.830> lot<00:01:43.010> of<00:01:43.100> people's<00:01:43.340> problems<00:01:43.820> they

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
think is a lot of people's problems they

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.910 
think is a lot of people's problems they
just<00:01:44.060> don't<00:01:44.420> know<00:01:44.570> what<00:01:44.690> they<00:01:44.810> have<00:01:44.960> and<00:01:45.320> the

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
just don't know what they have and the

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.200 
just don't know what they have and the
things<00:01:46.160> that<00:01:46.310> they<00:01:46.400> do<00:01:46.460> use<00:01:46.730> everyday<00:01:47.030> you

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
things that they do use everyday you

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.090 
things that they do use everyday you
have<00:01:47.390> nowhere<00:01:47.600> to<00:01:47.750> go<00:01:47.900> because<00:01:48.290> the<00:01:48.770> drawers

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
have nowhere to go because the drawers

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.680 
have nowhere to go because the drawers
and<00:01:49.250> the<00:01:49.400> cabinets<00:01:49.820> are<00:01:49.940> full<00:01:50.120> of<00:01:50.240> things<00:01:50.420> that

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
and the cabinets are full of things that

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.200 
and the cabinets are full of things that
they<00:01:50.810> never<00:01:51.020> use<00:01:51.200> so<00:01:51.830> clearing<00:01:52.580> things<00:01:52.760> out<00:01:52.970> is

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
they never use so clearing things out is

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.240 
they never use so clearing things out is
definitely<00:01:53.450> number<00:01:53.930> one<00:01:54.050> so<00:01:54.860> let<00:01:55.010> me<00:01:55.070> go<00:01:55.160> ahead

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
definitely number one so let me go ahead

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:05.980 
definitely number one so let me go ahead
and<00:01:55.370> show<00:01:55.790> you<00:01:55.850> how<00:01:56.480> it<00:01:56.690> all<00:01:56.810> turned<00:01:57.050> out<00:01:57.200> after

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.570 

so<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.080> first<00:02:07.260> area<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.860> we<00:02:07.950> tackled<00:02:08.369> was

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
so the first area that we tackled was

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.030 
so the first area that we tackled was
this<00:02:08.729> cabinet<00:02:09.210> above<00:02:09.600> the<00:02:09.990> toilet<00:02:10.380> so<00:02:10.890> we

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
this cabinet above the toilet so we

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.130 
this cabinet above the toilet so we
cleared<00:02:11.340> out<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.760> things<00:02:12.000> that<00:02:12.210> were<00:02:12.270> in<00:02:12.510> the

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
mean this could go all the way back and

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.680 
mean this could go all the way back and
there's<00:04:07.470> room<00:04:07.739> for<00:04:07.769> other<00:04:08.610> medications<00:04:09.420> and
