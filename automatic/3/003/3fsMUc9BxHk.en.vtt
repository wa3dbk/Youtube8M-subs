00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
do actually takes a little bit of time

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.650 
do actually takes a little bit of time
to<00:00:55.800> do<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.070> all<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.579> know<00:00:56.760> each<00:00:56.969> heist<00:00:57.270> takes

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
to do it all I know each heist takes

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.200 
to do it all I know each heist takes
like<00:00:57.899> an<00:00:58.079> hour<00:00:58.170> two<00:00:58.680> hours<00:00:58.949> maybe<00:00:59.160> um<00:00:59.430> because

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
like an hour two hours maybe um because

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.599 
like an hour two hours maybe um because
the<00:01:00.899> servers<00:01:01.260> were<00:01:01.289> kind<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.680> know<00:01:01.859> server

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
the servers were kind of you know server

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.000 
the servers were kind of you know server
issues<00:01:02.969> on<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.809> know<00:01:03.870> Tuesday<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.619> Wednesday

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
issues on you know Tuesday and Wednesday

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.300 
issues on you know Tuesday and Wednesday
so<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:06.060> think<00:01:06.689> that's<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.350> part<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.010> while<00:01:08.159> I

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
so I think that's a part of it while I

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.590 
so I think that's a part of it while I
people<00:01:08.610> couldn't<00:01:08.880> connect<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.270> game<00:01:09.420> it

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
people couldn't connect to the game it

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.090 
people couldn't connect to the game it
took<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.810> little<00:01:09.930> longer<00:01:10.020> than<00:01:10.350> normal<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.830> know

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
took a little longer than normal I know

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.530 
took a little longer than normal I know
for<00:01:11.369> one<00:01:11.520> we<00:01:11.700> actually<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.030> wait<00:01:12.180> about<00:01:12.270> three

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
for one we actually to wait about three

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.000 
for one we actually to wait about three
a<00:01:12.570> half<00:01:12.689> hours<00:01:12.960> total<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.380> get<00:01:13.500> everybody<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:13.950> a

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
a half hours total to get everybody in a

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.700 
a half hours total to get everybody in a
single<00:01:14.310> game<00:01:14.450> long<00:01:15.450> enough<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.750> do<00:01:15.990> all<00:01:16.350> five

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
single game long enough to do all five

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.530 
single game long enough to do all five
steps<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.700> setup<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.180> then<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.360> heist

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
steps of the setup and then the heist

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.300 
steps of the setup and then the heist

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.539 
they disconnected stuff like that it's
just<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.619> know<00:01:22.710> kind<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.070> trial<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.430> error

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
just you know kind of a trial and error

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.740 
just you know kind of a trial and error
with<00:01:23.729> Rockstar<00:01:24.210> there<00:01:24.330> try<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.540> get<00:01:24.630> their

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
with Rockstar there try to get their

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.510 
with Rockstar there try to get their
service<00:01:25.080> fixed<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.560> lot<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.220> people<00:01:26.430> are

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
service fixed a lot of people are

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.590 
service fixed a lot of people are
downloading<00:01:26.700> these<00:01:26.939> heists<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.390> they<00:01:27.479> all

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
downloading these heists and they all

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.749 
downloading these heists and they all
want<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.780> play<00:01:27.930> so<00:01:28.100> overall<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.130> think<00:01:29.340> that

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
want to play so overall I think that

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.940 
want to play so overall I think that
eventually<00:01:30.270> these<00:01:30.869> server<00:01:31.470> issues<00:01:31.770> will<00:01:31.920> be

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
eventually these server issues will be

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.980 
eventually these server issues will be
fixed<00:01:32.340> that's<00:01:32.790> not<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:32.970> big<00:01:33.150> problem<00:01:33.210> it's<00:01:33.780> just

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
fixed that's not a big problem it's just

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.560 
fixed that's not a big problem it's just
I<00:01:34.170> think<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.009> heist<00:01:35.299> the<00:01:36.299> setup

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
I think that the heist the setup

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.749 
I think that the heist the setup
missions<00:01:36.900> are<00:01:37.079> kind<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.590> repetitive<00:01:38.280> they're

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
missions are kind of repetitive they're

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.280 
missions are kind of repetitive they're
kind<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.240> know<00:01:39.270> very<00:01:39.570> very<00:01:39.600> easy<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.140> do

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
kind of you know very very easy to do

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.410 
kind of you know very very easy to do
and<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.770> think<00:01:40.799> instead<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.310> having<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.610> restart

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
and I think instead of having to restart

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.240 
and I think instead of having to restart
every<00:01:42.720> single<00:01:43.020> one<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:43.439> invite<00:01:43.770> your<00:01:43.979> friends

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
every single one so invite your friends

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.830 
every single one so invite your friends
to<00:01:44.310> every<00:01:44.549> single<00:01:44.850> one<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.479> should<00:01:45.659> just<00:01:45.780> be

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
to every single one you should just be

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.510 
to every single one you should just be
able<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.049> do<00:01:46.170> all<00:01:46.350> five<00:01:46.560> steps<00:01:46.890> in<00:01:47.009> one<00:01:47.220> time

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
able to do all five steps in one time

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.990 
able to do all five steps in one time

bite your friends all over again and it
just<00:02:06.090> causes<00:02:06.479> i<00:02:06.750> think<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:06.960> little<00:02:07.079> bit<00:02:07.200> more

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
just causes i think a little bit more

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.469 
just causes i think a little bit more
problems<00:02:07.799> in<00:02:08.399> terms<00:02:08.429> of<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.879> bunny<00:02:09.060> people's

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
problems in terms of the bunny people's

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.119 
problems in terms of the bunny people's
they<00:02:09.599> can't<00:02:09.840> connect<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.500> once<00:02:10.979> they

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
they can't connect to you and once they

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.589 
they can't connect to you and once they
are<00:02:11.160> connected<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:11.910> you<00:02:12.030> just<00:02:12.150> get<00:02:12.239> split<00:02:12.569> up

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
are connected and you just get split up

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.420 
are connected and you just get split up
it's<00:02:12.840> kinda<00:02:13.020> hard<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.230> get

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
it's kinda hard to get

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.920 
it's kinda hard to get
all<00:02:13.489> back<00:02:13.700> in<00:02:13.849> the<00:02:13.939> you<00:02:14.209> know<00:02:14.269> in<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.569> same

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
all back in the you know in the same

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.569 
all back in the you know in the same
game<00:02:15.140> so<00:02:15.439> I<00:02:15.650> think<00:02:15.980> that<00:02:16.280> they<00:02:16.370> should<00:02:16.400> just

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:16.579 
game so I think that they should just

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:18.670 
game so I think that they should just
have<00:02:16.849> kind<00:02:17.180> of<00:02:17.299> you<00:02:17.629> know<00:02:17.689> five<00:02:17.989> steps<00:02:18.319> all<00:02:18.500> in

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
have kind of you know five steps all in

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.399 
have kind of you know five steps all in
one<00:02:18.890> single<00:02:19.159> mission<00:02:19.730> and<00:02:20.090> not<00:02:20.450> five<00:02:20.810> you<00:02:21.290> know

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:21.409 
one single mission and not five you know

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:22.720 
one single mission and not five you know
separate<00:02:21.769> missions<00:02:22.069> for<00:02:22.219> five<00:02:22.370> separate

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
separate missions for five separate

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.580 
separate missions for five separate
steps<00:02:23.000> but<00:02:23.510> overall<00:02:23.780> guys<00:02:23.989> I<00:02:24.019> really<00:02:24.409> enjoy

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
steps but overall guys I really enjoy

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.839 
steps but overall guys I really enjoy
heist<00:02:24.859> I<00:02:25.099> think<00:02:25.340> they're<00:02:25.430> actually<00:02:25.519> one<00:02:25.819> of

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
heist I think they're actually one of

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.369 
heist I think they're actually one of
the<00:02:25.909> more<00:02:26.000> fun<00:02:26.329> things<00:02:26.569> that<00:02:26.780> I've<00:02:26.900> done<00:02:26.930> in<00:02:27.290> a
