I think what hiccup is grappling with
again<00:02:35.250> is<00:02:35.400> like<00:02:35.579> what<00:02:35.790> every<00:02:36.269> kid<00:02:36.629> is

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
grappling with it's just like trying to

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.179 
grappling with it's just like trying to
figure<00:02:39.690> out<00:02:39.840> who<00:02:40.470> they<00:02:40.650> are<00:02:40.680> how<00:02:41.069> they're

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:41.189 
figure out who they are how they're

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:43.580 
figure out who they are how they're
supposed<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:41.579> be<00:02:41.700> who<00:02:41.819> they<00:02:41.939> want<00:02:42.209> to<00:02:42.299> be<00:02:42.590> and

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
supposed to be who they want to be and

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.180 
supposed to be who they want to be and
how<00:02:43.980> do<00:02:44.040> you<00:02:44.129> how<00:02:44.579> do<00:02:44.640> you<00:02:44.730> balance<00:02:45.720> that<00:02:45.959> with

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
how do you how do you balance that with

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.319 
how do you how do you balance that with
everything<00:02:47.190> that<00:02:47.430> your<00:02:47.519> parents<00:02:47.879> expect<00:02:48.180> of

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
hiccups dad may not be I mean what is

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.940 
hiccups dad may not be I mean what is
his<00:04:19.650> reaction<00:04:20.310> if<00:04:20.940> you<00:04:21.030> guys<00:04:21.180> can<00:04:21.389> say<00:04:21.599> to<00:04:21.950> the

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
his reaction if you guys can say to the

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.570 
his reaction if you guys can say to the
discovery<00:04:23.430> of<00:04:23.550> his

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
discovery of his

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.869 
discovery of his
we<00:04:25.090> can't<00:04:25.330> sing<00:04:25.990> we<00:04:26.379> can't<00:04:26.949> say<00:04:27.190> all<00:04:27.430> that<00:04:27.729> we

00:04:27.869 --> 00:04:27.879 
we can't sing we can't say all that we

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:30.059 
we can't sing we can't say all that we
can<00:04:28.150> say<00:04:28.419> I<00:04:28.449> suspect<00:04:29.080> I'm<00:04:29.500> gonna<00:04:29.680> feel<00:04:29.860> this

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:30.069 
can say I suspect I'm gonna feel this

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:33.029 
can say I suspect I'm gonna feel this
one<00:04:30.129> I<00:04:30.750> think<00:04:31.750> all<00:04:32.110> that<00:04:32.289> we<00:04:32.409> can<00:04:32.650> see<00:04:32.889> is<00:04:33.009> that

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 
one I think all that we can see is that

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:35.730 
one I think all that we can see is that
you'll<00:04:33.430> sort<00:04:33.759> of<00:04:34.560> everything<00:04:35.560> will<00:04:35.650> be

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
you'll sort of everything will be

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.860 
you'll sort of everything will be
revealed<00:04:35.889> nothing<00:04:36.400> will<00:04:36.490> be<00:04:36.550> a<00:04:36.580> bit<00:04:37.000> more<00:04:37.180> make

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
revealed nothing will be a bit more make

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.180 
revealed nothing will be a bit more make
a<00:04:37.900> bit<00:04:38.080> more<00:04:38.110> sense<00:04:38.229> and<00:04:38.620> you'll<00:04:38.770> finally<00:04:38.979> have

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
a bit more sense and you'll finally have

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.850 
a bit more sense and you'll finally have
a<00:04:39.220> context<00:04:39.849> to<00:04:39.879> frame<00:04:40.210> hiccup<00:04:41.080> and<00:04:41.289> stoic<00:04:41.650> in

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
a context to frame hiccup and stoic in

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.899 
a context to frame hiccup and stoic in
and<00:04:42.520> and<00:04:42.909> actually<00:04:43.150> I<00:04:43.330> think<00:04:43.419> that<00:04:43.780> Stoics

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:44.909 
and and actually I think that Stoics

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:46.950 
and and actually I think that Stoics
Stokes<00:04:45.909> reaction<00:04:46.389> and<00:04:46.539> how<00:04:46.629> he<00:04:46.690> approached

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
Stokes reaction and how he approached

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.089 
Stokes reaction and how he approached
this<00:04:47.110> is<00:04:47.259> everything<00:04:47.560> is<00:04:47.650> probably<00:04:47.949> a<00:04:47.979> bit

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:48.099 
this is everything is probably a bit

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:49.379 
this is everything is probably a bit
more<00:04:48.280> surprising<00:04:48.909> than<00:04:49.090> you<00:04:49.210> might<00:04:49.360> think

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
more surprising than you might think

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:53.100 
more surprising than you might think
interesting<00:04:50.169> and<00:04:50.590> then<00:04:51.509> it<00:04:52.509> is<00:04:52.750> in<00:04:52.900> the<00:04:52.990> new

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
interesting and then it is in the new

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.770 
interesting and then it is in the new
trailer<00:04:55.409> we<00:04:56.409> really<00:04:56.680> wanted<00:04:56.979> it<00:04:57.099> in<00:04:57.219> there<00:04:57.400> but

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
trailer we really wanted it in there but

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.659 
trailer we really wanted it in there but
yeah<00:04:58.780> I<00:04:58.990> mean<00:04:59.169> as<00:04:59.409> far<00:04:59.530> as<00:04:59.590> stoic<00:05:00.009> seeing<00:05:00.250> Valka

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
yeah I mean as far as stoic seeing Valka

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:02.279 
yeah I mean as far as stoic seeing Valka
and<00:05:00.879> it<00:05:01.360> was<00:05:01.479> kind<00:05:01.659> of<00:05:01.719> designed<00:05:01.840> around<00:05:02.139> this

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:02.289 
and it was kind of designed around this

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:05.390 
and it was kind of designed around this
idea<00:05:02.560> that<00:05:03.090> you<00:05:04.090> know<00:05:04.210> he<00:05:04.629> would<00:05:04.840> just<00:05:05.080> become

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
idea that you know he would just become

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.339 
idea that you know he would just become
mute<00:05:06.400> and<00:05:06.580> aghast<00:05:06.789> as<00:05:07.690> though<00:05:07.900> he's<00:05:08.020> seeing<00:05:08.229> a

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:08.349 
mute and aghast as though he's seeing a
