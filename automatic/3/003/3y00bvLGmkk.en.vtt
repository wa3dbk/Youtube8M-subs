out today that showed the economy grew
by<00:01:27.000> about<00:01:27.150> one<00:01:27.540> point<00:01:27.840> eight<00:01:28.020> percent<00:01:28.590> but<00:01:29.100> I

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
by about one point eight percent but I

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.410 
by about one point eight percent but I
don't<00:01:29.369> think<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.640> grew<00:01:29.820> at<00:01:29.939> all<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.060> think<00:01:30.150> he

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
don't think it grew at all I think he

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.090 
don't think it grew at all I think he
contracted<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:31.320> think<00:01:31.860> there<00:01:32.009> were

contracting measured in gold measure it

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.450 
contracting measured in gold measure it
in<00:01:45.780> silver<00:01:46.079> I<00:01:46.259> mean<00:01:46.470> it's<00:01:46.590> going<00:01:47.040> off<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.340> edge

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
in silver I mean it's going off the edge

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.730 
in silver I mean it's going off the edge
of<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.729> cliff<00:01:47.909> if<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.329> measure<00:01:48.570> GDP<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.259> silver

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
of a cliff if you measure GDP and silver

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.340 
of a cliff if you measure GDP and silver
so<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.430> think<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.939> really<00:01:51.299> gamma<00:01:51.659> CAC<00:01:51.960> tivity

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
so I think the really gamma CAC tivity

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.950 
so I think the really gamma CAC tivity
is<00:01:52.950> contracting<00:01:53.759> inflation<00:01:54.420> makes<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.780> look

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
is contracting inflation makes it look

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.410 
is contracting inflation makes it look
as<00:01:55.140> if<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.409> economy<00:01:55.680> is<00:01:55.979> growing<00:01:56.180> that's<00:01:57.180> not

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
as if the economy is growing that's not

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.090 
as if the economy is growing that's not
happening<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.049> really<00:01:58.380> all<00:01:58.530> we're<00:01:58.740> doing<00:01:59.009> is

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
happening and really all we're doing is

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.920 
happening and really all we're doing is
spending<00:01:59.430> more<00:01:59.729> borrowed<00:02:00.180> money<00:02:00.390> we're

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
spending more borrowed money we're

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.170 
spending more borrowed money we're
digging<00:02:01.320> ourselves<00:02:01.439> into<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.100> deeper<00:02:02.460> hole<00:02:02.490> I'm

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
digging ourselves into a deeper hole I'm

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.600 
digging ourselves into a deeper hole I'm
afraid<00:02:03.600> we<00:02:03.719> may<00:02:03.899> never<00:02:04.049> get<00:02:04.259> out<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.649> well

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
afraid we may never get out of it well

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.280 
afraid we may never get out of it well
in<00:02:05.790> that<00:02:05.909> sense<00:02:06.180> if<00:02:06.329> we<00:02:06.450> look<00:02:06.630> at<00:02:06.750> rising<00:02:06.960> gold

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
in that sense if we look at rising gold

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.960 
in that sense if we look at rising gold
prices<00:02:07.530> rising<00:02:07.920> silver<00:02:08.310> prices<00:02:08.550> like<00:02:08.819> you

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
prices rising silver prices like you

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.210 
prices rising silver prices like you
said<00:02:09.239> there<00:02:09.479> are<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.750> lot<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.440> murmurs<00:02:10.920> out

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
said there are a lot of murmurs out

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.530 
said there are a lot of murmurs out
there<00:02:11.459> that<00:02:11.670> we<00:02:11.760> could<00:02:11.970> be<00:02:12.150> seeing

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
there that we could be seeing

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.119 
there that we could be seeing
a<00:02:12.569> collapse<00:02:12.989> of<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.200> dollar<00:02:13.379> coming<00:02:13.829> up<00:02:13.950> soon

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
a collapse of the dollar coming up soon

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:16.550 
a collapse of the dollar coming up soon
you<00:02:14.760> are<00:02:14.939> the<00:02:15.299> king<00:02:15.540> of<00:02:15.689> predictions<00:02:16.290> here

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
you are the king of predictions here

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.280 
you are the king of predictions here
what<00:02:16.950> do<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:17.099> say<00:02:17.280> I<00:02:17.780> think<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.870> dollar<00:02:19.079> will

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
what do you say I think the dollar will

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.690 
what do you say I think the dollar will
collapse<00:02:19.349> man<00:02:19.950> I<00:02:20.040> think<00:02:20.099> it<00:02:20.310> could<00:02:20.489> happen

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
collapse man I think it could happen

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.240 
collapse man I think it could happen
maybe<00:02:21.060> as<00:02:21.269> soon<00:02:21.540> as<00:02:21.659> this<00:02:21.840> fall<00:02:22.170> but<00:02:23.010> if<00:02:23.069> it

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
maybe as soon as this fall but if it

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.679 
maybe as soon as this fall but if it
doesn't<00:02:23.430> collapse<00:02:23.760> in<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.180> fall<00:02:24.450> it<00:02:24.599> will

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:24.689 
doesn't collapse in the fall it will

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:27.410 
doesn't collapse in the fall it will
collapse<00:02:24.959> and<00:02:25.379> soon<00:02:25.680> I<00:02:25.920> mean<00:02:26.099> I<00:02:26.280> think<00:02:26.939> if<00:02:27.299> you

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
collapse and soon I mean I think if you

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.000 
collapse and soon I mean I think if you
look<00:02:27.599> at<00:02:27.719> the<00:02:27.750> charts<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.469> dollar<00:02:28.709> is

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
look at the charts the dollar is

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.280 
look at the charts the dollar is
weakening<00:02:29.579> and<00:02:29.970> look<00:02:30.599> at<00:02:30.780> look<00:02:30.930> at<00:02:31.079> Ben

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
weakening and look at look at Ben

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.780

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
other commodity prices are rising it has

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:45.770 
other commodity prices are rising it has
nothing<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:45.000> do<00:02:45.120> with<00:02:45.269> all<00:02:45.389> the<00:02:45.510> money<00:02:45.540> that

tackle it that they're gonna completely
destroy<00:03:25.409> the<00:03:25.590> economy<00:03:25.879> but<00:03:26.879> if<00:03:27.199> that<00:03:28.199> choice

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
destroy the economy but if that choice

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.339 
destroy the economy but if that choice
is<00:03:28.650> too<00:03:29.129> too<00:03:29.669> bad<00:03:29.879> for<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.239> Fed<00:03:30.479> if<00:03:30.810> instead

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
is too too bad for the Fed if instead

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:32.869 
is too too bad for the Fed if instead
they<00:03:31.530> just<00:03:31.739> let<00:03:31.919> inflation<00:03:32.220> run<00:03:32.699> out<00:03:32.849> of

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 
they just let inflation run out of

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.879 
they just let inflation run out of
control<00:03:33.329> because<00:03:33.930> they<00:03:34.229> don't<00:03:34.409> want<00:03:34.620> to<00:03:34.709> raise

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
control because they don't want to raise

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:37.849 
control because they don't want to raise
rates<00:03:35.159> then<00:03:35.459> it's<00:03:35.609> worse<00:03:36.260> do<00:03:37.260> you<00:03:37.349> think<00:03:37.650> the

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
rates then it's worse do you think the

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.349 
rates then it's worse do you think the
Ben<00:03:38.040> Bernanke<00:03:38.549> you<00:03:38.669> say<00:03:38.849> that<00:03:39.000> he's<00:03:39.090> always

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
Ben Bernanke you say that he's always

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:40.819 
Ben Bernanke you say that he's always
wrong<00:03:39.659> but<00:03:40.079> do<00:03:40.139> you<00:03:40.229> think<00:03:40.290> that<00:03:40.500> he<00:03:40.650> really

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
wrong but do you think that he really

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.369 
wrong but do you think that he really
believes<00:03:41.819> what<00:03:42.419> he's<00:03:42.540> saying<00:03:42.599> or<00:03:43.199> that<00:03:43.319> he

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:43.379 
believes what he's saying or that he

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:44.809 
believes what he's saying or that he
really<00:03:43.530> thinks<00:03:43.979> he's<00:03:44.040> telling<00:03:44.459> people<00:03:44.729> the

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
really thinks he's telling people the

00:03:59.929 --> 00:03:59.939 
well he did a very good job of not

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:01.640 
well he did a very good job of not
answering<00:04:00.299> any<00:04:00.720> of<00:04:00.780> the<00:04:00.870> questions<00:04:01.349> and<00:04:01.560> if

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
answering any of the questions and if

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.589 
answering any of the questions and if
you<00:04:01.739> actually<00:04:01.979> saw<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:02.400> press<00:04:02.729> conference<00:04:02.760> he

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
you actually saw the press conference he

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.149 
you actually saw the press conference he
skated<00:04:04.049> around<00:04:04.290> everything<00:04:04.680> but<00:04:04.919> he<00:04:04.979> never

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159 
skated around everything but he never

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:07.219 
skated around everything but he never
really<00:04:05.430> gave<00:04:05.579> a<00:04:05.639> direct<00:04:06.030> answer<00:04:06.419> so<00:04:06.689> he<00:04:07.049> just

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:07.229 
really gave a direct answer so he just

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:09.860 
really gave a direct answer so he just
basically<00:04:07.560> gave<00:04:07.889> a<00:04:07.949> speech<00:04:08.340> interrupted<00:04:09.239> by

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
basically gave a speech interrupted by

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.770 
basically gave a speech interrupted by
questions<00:04:10.470> um<00:04:10.739> I<00:04:11.340> think<00:04:11.759> the<00:04:12.060> reason<00:04:12.209> he<00:04:12.509> did

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
questions um I think the reason he did

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.649 
questions um I think the reason he did
that<00:04:12.810> is<00:04:13.199> because<00:04:13.319> he's<00:04:13.919> trying<00:04:14.280> to<00:04:15.239> get<00:04:15.449> some

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:15.659 
that is because he's trying to get some

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:19.789 
that is because he's trying to get some
credibility<00:04:16.109> but<00:04:16.859> you<00:04:16.979> know<00:04:17.099> I<00:04:17.310> saw<00:04:18.239> a<00:04:18.799> report

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
credibility but you know I saw a report

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.560 
credibility but you know I saw a report
I<00:04:19.949> read<00:04:20.099> a<00:04:20.159> report<00:04:20.370> on<00:04:20.639> Bloomberg<00:04:21.120> that

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
I read a report on Bloomberg that

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.290 
I read a report on Bloomberg that
actually<00:04:21.989> described<00:04:22.590> the<00:04:23.490> press<00:04:23.760> conference

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
actually described the press conference

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.370 
actually described the press conference
as<00:04:24.539> a<00:04:24.570> success

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
as a success

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.500 
as a success
because<00:04:26.040> he<00:04:26.160> didn't<00:04:26.370> make<00:04:26.490> any<00:04:26.700> major<00:04:26.970> gaffes

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
because he didn't make any major gaffes

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.270 
because he didn't make any major gaffes
I<00:04:27.870> mean<00:04:27.990> it<00:04:28.080> wasn't<00:04:28.260> his<00:04:28.500> success<00:04:28.920> at<00:04:29.100> all

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
I mean it wasn't his success at all

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.670 
I mean it wasn't his success at all
during<00:04:29.910> the<00:04:30.150> press<00:04:30.390> conference<00:04:30.500> every<00:04:31.500> time

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
during the press conference every time

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.620 
during the press conference every time
he<00:04:31.860> opened<00:04:32.160> his<00:04:32.280> mouth<00:04:32.460> the<00:04:32.760> dollar<00:04:33.030> lost<00:04:33.390> more

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
he opened his mouth the dollar lost more

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.810 
he opened his mouth the dollar lost more
value<00:04:34.170> every<00:04:34.800> day<00:04:34.920> every<00:04:35.100> time<00:04:35.280> he<00:04:35.430> spoke<00:04:35.760> a

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
value every day every time he spoke a

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.240 
value every day every time he spoke a
syllable<00:04:36.390> Goldman<00:04:37.110> hit<00:04:37.380> a<00:04:37.410> new<00:04:37.620> record<00:04:37.800> I<00:04:38.130> mean

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
syllable Goldman hit a new record I mean

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.190 
syllable Goldman hit a new record I mean
it<00:04:38.370> wasn't<00:04:38.520> a<00:04:38.730> success<00:04:38.970> I<00:04:39.420> mean<00:04:39.540> unless<00:04:39.900> you

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
it wasn't a success I mean unless you

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.840 
it wasn't a success I mean unless you
think<00:04:40.380> the<00:04:40.560> Titanic<00:04:41.190> had<00:04:41.340> a<00:04:41.370> successful

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
think the Titanic had a successful

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.450 
think the Titanic had a successful
crossing<00:04:42.660> now<00:04:43.110> because<00:04:43.380> a<00:04:43.410> fewer<00:04:43.740> passengers

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
crossing now because a fewer passengers

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.940 
crossing now because a fewer passengers
had<00:04:44.910> to<00:04:44.940> make<00:04:45.180> it<00:04:45.360> that<00:04:45.540> the<00:04:45.930> New<00:04:46.200> York<00:04:46.470> I<00:04:46.650> mean

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
had to make it that the New York I mean

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.040 
had to make it that the New York I mean
this<00:04:47.220> was<00:04:47.280> a<00:04:47.460> disaster<00:04:48.270> of<00:04:48.480> a<00:04:48.810> press

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
this was a disaster of a press

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.130 
this was a disaster of a press
conference<00:04:49.530> and<00:04:49.860> you<00:04:50.820> know<00:04:50.940> and<00:04:51.240> i<00:04:51.480> think<00:04:51.720> you

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
conference and you know and i think you

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.190 
conference and you know and i think you

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
if you see a big rally in gold there's a

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.720 
if you see a big rally in gold there's a
good<00:04:55.380> chance<00:04:55.740> that<00:04:56.040> ben<00:04:56.250> bernanke<00:04:56.700> is

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
good chance that ben bernanke is

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.890 
good chance that ben bernanke is
speaking<00:04:57.180> somewhere<00:04:59.570> that's<00:05:00.570> good<00:05:00.750> I<00:05:00.780> like

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
speaking somewhere that's good I like

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.810

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.760 
what you're actually calling a
retraction<00:05:09.540> in<00:05:09.810> the<00:05:09.930> economy<00:05:10.380> is<00:05:10.500> that<00:05:10.680> the

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
retraction in the economy is that the

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.380 
retraction in the economy is that the
fact<00:05:10.980> that<00:05:11.130> there<00:05:11.670> was<00:05:11.790> less<00:05:12.180> government

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.390 
fact that there was less government

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.570 
fact that there was less government
spending<00:05:12.960> somehow<00:05:13.770> I<00:05:13.800> guess<00:05:14.130> there<00:05:14.310> is<00:05:14.430> less

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
spending somehow I guess there is less

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.100 
spending somehow I guess there is less
defense<00:05:14.970> spending<00:05:15.390> going<00:05:15.660> on<00:05:15.810> although<00:05:15.990> I

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
defense spending going on although I

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.210 
defense spending going on although I
don't<00:05:16.290> really<00:05:16.500> know<00:05:16.680> how<00:05:16.860> that's<00:05:17.100> possible

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
don't really know how that's possible

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.190 
don't really know how that's possible
but<00:05:18.000> let's<00:05:18.210> say<00:05:18.390> the<00:05:18.540> Congress<00:05:18.930> right<00:05:19.170> now

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
but let's say the Congress right now

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.490 
but let's say the Congress right now
does<00:05:19.770> actually<00:05:20.040> start<00:05:20.490> making<00:05:20.850> drastic

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
does actually start making drastic

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.320 
does actually start making drastic
budget<00:05:22.500> cuts<00:05:22.770> and<00:05:22.950> they<00:05:23.610> increase<00:05:24.000> over<00:05:24.300> the

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
budget cuts and they increase over the

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.300 
budget cuts and they increase over the
next<00:05:24.420> couple<00:05:24.750> months<00:05:25.050> then<00:05:25.590> should<00:05:25.980> we<00:05:26.010> just

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
next couple months then should we just

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:27.650 
next couple months then should we just
get<00:05:26.430> used<00:05:26.670> to<00:05:26.820> these<00:05:26.940> horrible<00:05:27.270> numbers

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 
get used to these horrible numbers

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.720 
get used to these horrible numbers
getting<00:05:28.020> used<00:05:28.230> to<00:05:28.380> unemployment<00:05:29.190> being<00:05:29.370> as<00:05:29.580> it

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:29.730 
getting used to unemployment being as it

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.300 
getting used to unemployment being as it
is<00:05:30.140> well<00:05:31.140> look<00:05:31.500> if<00:05:31.680> the<00:05:31.830> government<00:05:32.250> really

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
is well look if the government really

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.210 
is well look if the government really
made<00:05:32.880> a<00:05:33.180> big<00:05:33.420> spending<00:05:34.410> cuts<00:05:34.650> that<00:05:34.830> would<00:05:35.100> be

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
made a big spending cuts that would be

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.070 
made a big spending cuts that would be
good<00:05:35.400> for<00:05:35.610> the<00:05:35.700> economy<00:05:35.970> because<00:05:36.750> the<00:05:36.900> more

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
good for the economy because the more

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.930 
good for the economy because the more
the<00:05:37.230> government<00:05:37.710> spends<00:05:38.250> the<00:05:38.580> more<00:05:38.820> the

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
the government spends the more the

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.390 
the government spends the more the
private<00:05:39.360> sector<00:05:39.720> can't<00:05:40.020> invest<00:05:40.530> and<00:05:40.860> that's

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
private sector can't invest and that's

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.010 
private sector can't invest and that's
what<00:05:41.550> we<00:05:41.640> need<00:05:41.790> to<00:05:41.880> grow<00:05:42.060> the<00:05:42.210> economy<00:05:42.300> we<00:05:42.840> need

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
what we need to grow the economy we need

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.960 
what we need to grow the economy we need
more<00:05:43.170> savings<00:05:43.740> more<00:05:44.280> investment<00:05:44.850> more

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
more savings more investment more

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.910 
more savings more investment more
production<00:05:45.570> but<00:05:45.960> we<00:05:46.050> can't<00:05:46.290> afford<00:05:46.350> any<00:05:46.830> of

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:46.920 
production but we can't afford any of

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.530 
production but we can't afford any of
that<00:05:47.100> because<00:05:47.520> the<00:05:47.790> government<00:05:48.210> is<00:05:48.270> spending

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.540 
that because the government is spending

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.750 
that because the government is spending
all<00:05:48.840> of<00:05:48.870> our<00:05:49.080> wealth<00:05:49.350> so<00:05:49.650> if<00:05:49.890> we<00:05:50.160> really<00:05:50.430> had

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:50.760 
all of our wealth so if we really had

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.820 
all of our wealth so if we really had
big<00:05:51.150> cuts<00:05:51.420> in<00:05:51.570> government<00:05:51.600> spending<00:05:52.050> you

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
big cuts in government spending you

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.800 
big cuts in government spending you
coming<00:05:53.250> with<00:05:53.310> approve<00:05:53.670> the<00:05:54.330> problem<00:05:54.720> is

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
coming with approve the problem is

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.720 
coming with approve the problem is
that's<00:05:55.140> not<00:05:55.380> going<00:05:55.650> to<00:05:55.800> happen<00:05:55.950> and<00:05:56.370> when

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:56.730 
that's not going to happen and when

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.070 
that's not going to happen and when
they're<00:05:56.820> talking<00:05:57.180> about<00:05:57.210> lower<00:05:57.510> government

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
they're talking about lower government

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.050 
they're talking about lower government
spending<00:05:58.470> in<00:05:58.590> these<00:05:58.710> GDP<00:05:59.160> numbers<00:05:59.520> it's<00:05:59.850> not

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
spending in these GDP numbers it's not

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.670 
spending in these GDP numbers it's not
actually<00:06:00.630> lower<00:06:00.840> spending<00:06:01.230> its<00:06:01.470> lower

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
actually lower spending its lower

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.440 
actually lower spending its lower
spending<00:06:02.100> that<00:06:02.370> maybe<00:06:02.550> they<00:06:02.730> had<00:06:02.880> forecast

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:03.450 
spending that maybe they had forecast

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.570 
spending that maybe they had forecast
but<00:06:04.200> the<00:06:04.350> government<00:06:04.650> is<00:06:04.830> spending<00:06:05.100> more<00:06:05.520> I

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
but the government is spending more I

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.160 
but the government is spending more I
mean<00:06:05.670> the<00:06:05.880> government<00:06:06.060> has<00:06:06.360> never<00:06:06.630> spent<00:06:06.930> as

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.170 
mean the government has never spent as

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:08.990 
mean the government has never spent as
much<00:06:07.200> money<00:06:07.620> as<00:06:07.830> is<00:06:08.280> spending<00:06:08.640> right<00:06:08.820> now

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
much money as is spending right now

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.610 
much money as is spending right now
that's<00:06:09.480> the<00:06:09.720> problem<00:06:09.990> and<00:06:10.320> the<00:06:10.410> bigger

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 
that's the problem and the bigger

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.440 
that's the problem and the bigger
problem<00:06:10.890> is<00:06:11.220> the<00:06:11.370> way<00:06:11.490> their<00:06:11.640> financing<00:06:12.300> it

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:12.450 
problem is the way their financing it

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.720 
problem is the way their financing it
they're<00:06:12.960> not<00:06:13.140> taxing<00:06:13.800> us<00:06:13.920> to<00:06:14.130> pay<00:06:14.310> for<00:06:14.610> all

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:44.450 
country the entire world is heading but

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:46.180 
country the entire world is heading but
I<00:06:44.480> guess<00:06:44.810> that's<00:06:45.050> the<00:06:45.470> truth<00:06:45.740> right<00:06:45.860> there

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:46.190 
I guess that's the truth right there

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.150 
I guess that's the truth right there
isn't<00:06:46.340> it<00:06:46.460> thank<00:06:46.640> you<00:06:46.730> so<00:06:46.850> much<00:06:47.000> for
