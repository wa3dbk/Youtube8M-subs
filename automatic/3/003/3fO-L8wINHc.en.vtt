00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:07.140
 and people are talking here, beauty is the 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.990
 be to minimize one more video of the 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.190
 started in minecraft and well 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.769
 People in the video today will bring the 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.789
 You guys, another video here echoes our 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.430
 The series is survival in the air already 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.160
 forgot the name of the sucker of the series 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.000
 guys this series was well accepted by 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.750
 You already reached 54 lights , so I asked. 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.880
 only 49 and I was very humble of this 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.930
 part because I know you guys would like 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.399
 much of this series 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.829
 so I decided to bring the second episode 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.300
 here this good series why 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.129
 it took so long to leave 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.480
 mainly because I have no time 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.480
 with stories from my mother 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.719
 There are to make sales to leave 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.820
 that's when I'm worried 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.820
 so I 'll bring it here it's going to be a 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.440
 episode very quickly and I go and do it 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.090
 some things my time here in this 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:03.870
 video and again the goal is 40 lax for is 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.180
 episode 3 of survival in the 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.670
 air better than you can see my 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.530
 It's great, everyone, everybody. 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.290
 You'll think how's it going so far? 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.780
 big and mister together with another colleague 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.970
 I've been playing a lot here and only 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.240
 the things is that I can that way 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.810
 in the form of video normally 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.759
 1 here is a regime that is one that is a 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.470
 material that serves to cut is well 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:33.420
 the faster it is against the tree 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:36.810
 and I also made some swords 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.259
 here because at night I made that area 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.240
 the mobi Parana SEMOB and I get by 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.549
 Example skeleton is one of the mobile 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.290
 that I need more here 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.390
 and the other one I need is the 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.460
 spider because of the webs you can 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.470
 see I'm hungry and have here 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.720
 People and this episode I'm going to do. 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.600
 two epic things 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.520
 come on first, I'm 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.229
 starting a path here to show 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.290
 video to you I will get that 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.570
 No fucking noise there, it 's already helping people. 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.429
 in our survival in areas for 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.310
 I 'll need lots of wood 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.290
 I already have enough wood so let's go 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.930
 pick up here 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:22.250
 When I pick ten pieces of wood here, I think 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:25.860
 Let's turn into a party here in Lages. 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:29.220
 I think 64 of the guys if I think it gives 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:32.760
 I think even animals go there on this line 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.060
 Serginho, I think people talk about it. 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.610
 thing 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.680
 I hit there, so I can not forget how I 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.680
 I got more land only starts with a 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:44.780
 very simple land you see here I 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:47.850
 I'll even show you how it starts from here. 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.610
 a tree seedling or with this 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:54.090
 earthworm, the people here are you 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:58.050
 simply click on one in the empty 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:04.080
 it will fill your eye and if you get show 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:05.520
 demonstrate right when it reaches 5% he 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.430
 dropped a land you see 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.160
 So that's how I get the theme for 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.790
 make more trees and the rest of europe 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:20.480
 in the trees there is very easy 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:23.130
 Come on and continue ours fell galley 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.910
 is during these times that what he is 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.330
 works 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.310
 I know that sometimes you fall and become 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.170
 you have not only the galera some more 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.370
 sometimes buga and can happen to be 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:42.180
 It's difficult to drop down there. 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:45.150
 so here we go, the furniture that has this 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:50.570
 trunk there should be very important for us 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.570
 and I'll do it here 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.220
 I think this scheme was kind of good 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:05.959
 ready because we get the trunk and the 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.819
 clothes galley a stand galley nickel 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.980
 one of the most important things in the mold 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:13.489
 that's it, let's get this noise no 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:16.310
 back good guys now we have one 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.989
 stone quilter here and it will be very 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.910
 important and we can not miss this 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.900
 train time anything we put a 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.120
 needle here right? 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.130
 Tony, what are you doing, folks? 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.260
 It is very important to make the generator 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.440
 of lava to another thing era how to do 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.180
 here is I'm going to try to do here I 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.250
 I will not try to make water 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.919
 I'll get eight of these here. 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:41.419
 turn into the aldershot which is a 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:43.970
 bottle of water and 2 good and let's put 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:46.970
 here in our neighborhood 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:49.490
 now I make an empty shack where's 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.120
 Brazil neighborhood so we can use another 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.550
 form 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.350
 What is the use of this bridge oil? 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:58.550
 use a bucket to pick up this 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:05:00.800
 water and transform into an infinite source 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.750
 and we will also use this water 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.750
 to make the clay in the next episode 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.100
 Then I'll teach you to hide more. 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.950
 it looks like it's going to get cooler yet 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.830
 nothing better that we do is 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:15.410
 start making our cross cross aibo 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.030
 aib is the best machine you have here that 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.310
 Use it to make lava so lets start. 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.400
 to make a fault in the cross knows what is the 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:27.289
 raw know it's not hot, let's go 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:31.970
 We need to save this one. 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:38.389
 and we will need 1810 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:42.979
 from here and we will also need twig 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:45.200
 let's turn that web into wood 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:46.130
 we are going to turn into cyclones and it is 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.280
 silk 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:52.970
 we need two and finally we will 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:56.660
 Let's do it, it's more serious. 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:59.599
 ready now let's do an o kiss iv o 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:01.370
 that is a possible is xxiv is very 

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:03.870
 easy I said that I know it 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:07.080
 sorry I said I'll do the oxy 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.820
 is the sieve to serving this sieve 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.840
 in this sieve is very important for 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:15.690
 all the people you play there are inside her 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:17.970
 docs for example this land here and she 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:20.460
 important things come out, for example if 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:22.640
 I put dirt on you, it's gonna stoner. 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:25.350
 which are particles to make stone look 

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.300
 The guys with the four of them are very good. 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.020
 questions we make here a body 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.580
 weird 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.380
 so these temporary people and today I 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.690
 I think we've done enough things already. 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:37.460
 interesting here I'll continue here is 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:40.680
 using our machines get one more 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:43.500
 Tip the tree seedlings 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:47.190
 when you put it inside that 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:49.980
 Here, the eight seedlings are equivalent to 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:52.680
 a land a couple of land equivalent to 

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:54.840
 a stone then I have this math in the 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.700
 of you guys but this guys from 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.470
 It is now very here and will stay

 that it is very difficult to do the galera and 

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:17.910
 per second 

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:19.680
 we do is cross out heating and Vuk 

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:21.690
