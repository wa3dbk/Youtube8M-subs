00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:06.190
 Here it is one of the synthetic function that let's open Heide a look and to buy what kind of problem 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:10.929
 Please give me 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:15.849
 When fx of sheets of Sekusu +3 gx 2x +1 ThatLookLikeThis 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:19.210
 It is true that the f-circle gx and g 6 r fx are unequal when they become equal 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:21.560
 But it was the problem of I mean Ugh find the values of the constants a, as 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:26.150
 Yeah voice synthetic function that was the previous video 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:30.140
 I'm using it for my knowledge , but if I wanted to go with synthetic functions , I would have two steps 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:35.540
 The impression of one would say that it asked whether it was synthetic completion 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:40.460
 This embedded gx is x2 in the fx equation 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.550
 It says that assigning the four seasons of gx is've done and Hitoshi g 6 r fx is gx 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.870
 To the formula 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:49.020
 I've done the task of substituting fx for -x 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.980
 Normally this doesn't say frx and g 6 r fx 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:57.720
 I stepped on it and gx and g 6 fx did not match 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.350
 Please review the what or rather Wakewakara previous videos I came up here to say a total of it 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.680
 There is 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:06.729
 Well, like this time , I don't usually agree 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:10.780
 There is also the problem of asking for a submission at the same time 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:18.720
 If you say how to do it, it is roughly said 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:23.190
 The f- maru gx and grx are in agreement in the other way 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:28.350
 This x2 or more coefficient and the same x-coefficient 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:32.040
 Constants Here parts are completely identical or a = dib this easy to handle 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:36.090
 I What is Do not want to have large because stop even if I mean not that the wind 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.510
 Of course, this is Shi ordeal be nice to be may City Gojo say until Hence the mountain to it that the problem 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.710
 Ne 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:44.440
 Car Well variety of Hen may end up on the other one tablet 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:47.680
 There is a big strategy when comparing the coefficients in the same form and the same form 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:52.570
 It is about to practice about it this time 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:55.750
 Well this time is also exactly that f circle gx = g 6 r fx match 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.730
 That say to the attempt is made to represent the fr gx in the form 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:03.860
 So in this x part of fx this expression of gx 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:08.330
 The point in organizing cats is that it will be like this when substituting and organizing 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:14.060
 A bookstore Japan here and x2 squared like x3 Sonya 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:19.010
 This x After Ichijo team and the constant team like that way of sharing 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:23.150
 Similarly, in g 6 fx , substitute the seasons of fx for this gx -x part. 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:27.310
 When it comes to this kind of expression , and the point in organizing this is the point 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:33.040
 x- I divided into a team and a constant team 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:35.819
 And it is natural that these are the same here and here together 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:40.980
 This one o'clock coefficient shares 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:41.430
 I make a wind funds say kneaded'm supposed coefficient of this constant is so and I'm together 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.980
 Ne 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:49.439
 So if you pay attention to this x-Article k, I 'm up to now Ieyasu Well both of course naturally together 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:54.870
 It is constant even it and anything I is 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:55.469
 Let's set the bait so that it seems that Masada Maeda + this 7 should be completely in agreement 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:55.810
 Or thing 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:03:00.010
 So 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:04.370
 My blue +3 = I would like to put up a formula to say that it is good to polish this in this case 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:08.810
 It is a flow that the answer is completed even with this 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:13.700
 Even now, I'm fine with this, but I want to say that when I say f f gx gbr 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.330
 It is understood that both will become 8x + and match and it will match 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.530
 Ne 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:23.750
 You think it was easy I I have done well there in the rigidity feeling, etc in Aiu it 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.360
 That frx FREX be obtained even g pro x and coefficients in the same form 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.610
 Compare 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:34.470
 And how to put together a point cat at that time , but this time though there was no abnormality in x- 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:39.330
 Well if you hit a hit team on team one team k team more than 30 teams 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:44.380
 may be referred to solve each case compared divided valley have j 6 ground team constant team 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:47.460
 After being able to solve this problem, I can catch it with no hints myself 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.460
 Let's sing well
