into<00:00:36.030> his<00:00:36.149> computer<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:37.040> then<00:00:38.040> played<00:00:38.399> one

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
into his computer and then played one

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.540 
into his computer and then played one
horrible<00:00:39.930> phrase<00:00:40.350> over<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.920> over<00:00:43.520> yeah<00:00:44.520> I

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
horrible phrase over and over yeah I

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.709 
horrible phrase over and over yeah I
guess<00:00:44.730> he<00:00:44.820> could<00:00:44.940> have<00:00:44.969> done<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.239> in<00:00:45.300> fruity

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
guess he could have done this in fruity

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:54.200 
guess he could have done this in fruity
loops<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:47.090> stretch<00:00:48.440> back<00:00:49.440> in<00:00:49.969> 2002<00:00:51.260> so<00:00:53.210> how

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
loops to stretch back in 2002 so how

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.459 
loops to stretch back in 2002 so how
does<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.449> game<00:00:54.570> handle<00:00:55.699> well<00:00:57.170> you<00:00:58.170> can<00:00:58.320> move

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
does the game handle well you can move

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.400 
does the game handle well you can move
left<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.190> can<00:00:59.340> move<00:00:59.520> right<00:00:59.550> that's

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
that's not handling really oh I see what

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.380 
that's not handling really oh I see what
you're<00:01:08.909> saying<00:01:09.150> but<00:01:10.549> shooting<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.790> actually

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
you're saying but shooting is actually

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.899 
you're saying but shooting is actually
pretty<00:01:12.600> tedious<00:01:12.920> it's<00:01:13.920> not<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.189> right<00:01:14.610> trigger

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
pretty tedious it's not a right trigger

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.730 
pretty tedious it's not a right trigger
affair<00:01:15.360> it's<00:01:15.600> straight<00:01:16.500> up<00:01:18.530> maybe<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.650> is

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
affair it's straight up maybe it is

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.469 
affair it's straight up maybe it is
right<00:01:19.920> rivet<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.400> don't<00:01:20.759> even<00:01:20.850> remember<00:01:21.030> but

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
right rivet I don't even remember but

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.039 
right rivet I don't even remember but
you<00:01:21.720> have<00:01:21.869> to

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
you have to

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.770 
you have to
repeatedly<00:01:24.250> push<00:01:25.060> the<00:01:25.210> button<00:01:25.479> pull<00:01:25.659> the

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
repeatedly push the button pull the

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.600 
repeatedly push the button pull the
trigger<00:01:25.990> for<00:01:26.170> each<00:01:26.320> shot<00:01:26.560> and<00:01:27.250> there<00:01:27.430> is

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
trigger for each shot and there is

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.080 
trigger for each shot and there is
literally<00:01:28.390> no<00:01:28.659> excuse<00:01:29.020> for<00:01:29.049> that<00:01:29.260> in<00:01:29.590> 2010<00:01:30.280> no

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
literally no excuse for that in 2010 no

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.330 
literally no excuse for that in 2010 no
but<00:01:31.510> I<00:01:31.540> mean<00:01:31.750> that<00:01:31.990> I<00:01:32.229> guess<00:01:32.740> it<00:01:32.920> kind<00:01:33.280> of

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
but I mean that I guess it kind of

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.969 
but I mean that I guess it kind of
separates<00:01:33.970> the<00:01:34.180> boys<00:01:34.690> from<00:01:34.840> the<00:01:35.110> men<00:01:35.140> yeah

probably<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:31.660> most<00:02:32.640> pathetic<00:02:34.049> like<00:02:35.049> that's

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
probably the most pathetic like that's

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.759 
probably the most pathetic like that's
supposed<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:35.799> be<00:02:35.890> an<00:02:36.010> enemy<00:02:36.780> yeah<00:02:37.810> I<00:02:38.260> don't

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
supposed to be an enemy yeah I don't

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.130 
supposed to be an enemy yeah I don't
understand<00:02:39.130> like<00:02:39.310> can<00:02:39.519> you<00:02:39.549> even<00:02:39.850> die<00:02:40.329> on<00:02:40.720> the

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
understand like can you even die on the

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.270 
understand like can you even die on the
first<00:02:41.380> half<00:02:41.620> of<00:02:41.739> these<00:02:41.890> levels

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
first half of these levels

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.949 
first half of these levels
how<00:02:42.790> many<00:02:42.970> guess<00:02:43.180> if<00:02:43.329> you<00:02:43.480> were<00:02:43.570> having<00:02:43.870> a

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
how many guess if you were having a

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.710 
how many guess if you were having a
seizure<00:02:43.989> or<00:02:44.739> some<00:02:45.310> medical<00:02:45.579> emergency<00:02:46.420> where

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
seizure or some medical emergency where

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.229 
seizure or some medical emergency where
the<00:02:47.709> controllers<00:02:48.190> dropped<00:02:48.430> out<00:02:48.610> of<00:02:48.640> your<00:02:48.850> hand

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
the controllers dropped out of your hand

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.120 
the controllers dropped out of your hand
yeah<00:02:49.600> I<00:02:49.630> guess<00:02:49.900> or<00:02:50.140> if<00:02:50.320> you<00:02:50.410> went<00:02:50.560> to<00:02:50.620> go<00:02:50.739> drop<00:02:50.980> a

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
yeah I guess or if you went to go drop a

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.810 
yeah I guess or if you went to go drop a
deuce<00:02:51.540> like<00:02:52.540> 30<00:02:53.350> minutes<00:02:53.769> elapsed<00:02:54.340> yeah<00:02:54.610> maybe

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
deuce like 30 minutes elapsed yeah maybe

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.240 
deuce like 30 minutes elapsed yeah maybe
if<00:02:55.510> you<00:02:55.660> waited<00:02:55.870> a<00:02:56.140> full<00:02:56.380> half-hour<00:02:56.860> they

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
if you waited a full half-hour they

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.699 
if you waited a full half-hour they
would<00:02:57.400> start<00:02:57.700> to<00:02:57.820> get<00:02:57.970> close<00:02:58.150> to<00:02:58.329> you<00:02:58.480> and<00:02:59.170> you

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
would start to get close to you and you

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.350 
would start to get close to you and you
have<00:02:59.860> a<00:02:59.890> health<00:03:00.160> bar<00:03:00.220> so<00:03:00.640> I'm<00:03:00.730> assuming<00:03:01.269> they

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
have a health bar so I'm assuming they

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.319 
have a health bar so I'm assuming they
don't<00:03:01.480> kill<00:03:01.720> you<00:03:01.810> in<00:03:01.930> one<00:03:01.959> hit<00:03:03.090> it's<00:03:04.090> really

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329 
don't kill you in one hit it's really

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:04.890 
don't kill you in one hit it's really
difficult

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
difficult

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.890 
difficult
the<00:03:04.989> boss<00:03:05.380> doesn't<00:03:06.250> yeah<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:07.480> boss<00:03:07.660> doesn't

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
the boss doesn't yeah the boss doesn't

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.050 
the boss doesn't yeah the boss doesn't
even<00:03:08.109> come<00:03:08.290> close

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
even come close

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:18.620 
even come close
oh<00:03:10.680> well<00:03:11.680> you<00:03:12.610> pew<00:03:13.000> pew<00:03:14.430> puh-puh-puh<00:03:15.430> oh<00:03:16.740> yeah

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
oh well you pew pew puh-puh-puh oh yeah

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.360 
oh well you pew pew puh-puh-puh oh yeah
that<00:03:19.630> pretty<00:03:20.050> much<00:03:20.170> actually<00:03:21.010> I<00:03:21.040> think<00:03:21.130> that's

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
that pretty much actually I think that's

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.800 
that pretty much actually I think that's
a<00:03:21.430> very<00:03:21.520> good<00:03:21.760> way<00:03:21.880> to<00:03:21.910> sum<00:03:22.270> up<00:03:22.390> this<00:03:22.569> game

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
a very good way to sum up this game

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.140 
a very good way to sum up this game
mm-hmm<00:03:23.440> well<00:03:23.830> I<00:03:23.860> I<00:03:24.130> feel<00:03:24.580> bad<00:03:24.790> saying<00:03:25.000> that

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
mm-hmm well I I feel bad saying that

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.550 
mm-hmm well I I feel bad saying that
it's<00:03:25.390> clearly<00:03:25.600> a<00:03:25.720> lot<00:03:25.930> of<00:03:25.959> effort<00:03:26.350> went<00:03:26.440> into

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
it's clearly a lot of effort went into

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.040 
it's clearly a lot of effort went into
this<00:03:26.770> I<00:03:27.010> mean<00:03:27.130> look<00:03:27.190> at<00:03:27.489> the<00:03:28.300> variety<00:03:28.870> in<00:03:28.959> the

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
this I mean look at the variety in the

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.050 
this I mean look at the variety in the
gameplay<00:03:29.080> we<00:03:29.709> have<00:03:29.800> red<00:03:30.040> planets<00:03:30.520> now<00:03:30.730> we<00:03:30.790> used

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
gameplay we have red planets now we used

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.930 
gameplay we have red planets now we used
to<00:03:31.150> have<00:03:31.270> blue<00:03:31.480> ones<00:03:31.690> and<00:03:32.760> they're<00:03:33.760> pretty

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
to have blue ones and they're pretty

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.510 
to have blue ones and they're pretty
close<00:03:34.180> like<00:03:34.450> this<00:03:34.569> is<00:03:34.750> a<00:03:35.100> densely<00:03:36.100> populated

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
close like this is a densely populated

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.870 
close like this is a densely populated
solar<00:03:37.300> system<00:03:37.750> yeah<00:03:38.319> this<00:03:39.040> is<00:03:39.220> way<00:03:39.430> denser

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
solar system yeah this is way denser

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.550 
solar system yeah this is way denser
than<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:40.510> universal<00:03:41.020> average<00:03:41.380> that's

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
than the the universal average that's

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
than the the universal average that's
for<00:03:41.739> sure<00:03:42.660> we've<00:03:43.660> got<00:03:43.690> an<00:03:43.810> outlier<00:03:44.400> is<00:03:45.400> there

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
for sure we've got an outlier is there

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.430 
for sure we've got an outlier is there
even<00:03:45.790> any<00:03:45.940> way<00:03:46.090> to<00:03:46.150> dodge<00:03:46.510> the<00:03:46.810> bosses<00:03:47.140> attacks

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
even any way to dodge the bosses attacks

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.990 
even any way to dodge the bosses attacks
it<00:03:47.709> seems<00:03:47.920> like<00:03:48.100> you<00:03:48.190> just<00:03:48.340> kind<00:03:48.489> of<00:03:48.640> have<00:03:48.820> to

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
it seems like you just kind of have to

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.720 
it seems like you just kind of have to
get<00:03:49.360> hit<00:03:49.540> by<00:03:49.660> one<00:03:49.840> every<00:03:50.080> single<00:03:50.380> time<00:03:50.560> I<00:03:50.860> mean

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
get hit by one every single time I mean

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.040 
get hit by one every single time I mean
if<00:03:52.060> you're<00:03:52.570> really<00:03:52.720> patient<00:03:53.260> you<00:03:53.410> can<00:03:55.050> but

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
if you're really patient you can but

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:57.840 
if you're really patient you can but
you're<00:03:56.170> not<00:03:56.319> I'm<00:03:57.280> not

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
you're not I'm not
