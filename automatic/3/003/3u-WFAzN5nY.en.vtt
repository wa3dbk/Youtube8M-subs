 [music] 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:15.980

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:17.780
 from china in past past video i 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.029
 read something with my voice and 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.369
 so on but some sad all is not 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.950
 so I told the guys that much for now 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.380
 getting tired and unpacking if the business did something 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.220
 evening budget from fatigue today 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.870
 I decided to do it in the morning while I have the strength 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.610
 mood here today 2 unpacking 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.930
 from china here will be with us today 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.699
 hromakey and cover for macbook pro which 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.559
 I'm already somewhere I ride it with 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:45.199
 a three or four months is not yet 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.420
 I will unpack because I did not need it 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:49.970
 just now I decided to unpack look at 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.800
 parcel size fits together here 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.019
 what would say there ask 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.300
 many about the new year of chinese 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:58.430
 as soon as I have the information already 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.320
 authentic that is i mean exactly dates 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.500
 about there new year it is written that 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.510
 will be February 19th, that is, a week ago 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.400
 well as far as I know large 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.020
 suppliers are not working that is gone already 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.740
 to rest it will be until March 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.030
 because the new year in china is chinese so 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.210
 for one of the biggest holidays 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.700
 new year and by the duration they have in 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.380
 area somewhere there for two weeks so with 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.079
 Parcels if anyone has not ordered 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.180
 see here that guided what 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:28.369
 coming in the days already ordering and 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.409
 Parcels are not worth it because there are none 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.750
 rule and then you will have problems with 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.640
 a refund and in short is all but 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.259
 as soon as i know the numbers i will tell you 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.479
 that with such and such 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.960
 the Chinese will rest and generally that is 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:44.899
 do not reply anything do not send anything 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.600
 well, in short, let's all be frozen 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:51.950
 unpack probably start with a cover 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:54.229
 the case is so interesting and it cost him 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.509
 moment of purchase 12 dollars an hour I 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.609
 He looked it costs 15 dollars 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:01.429
 so the course has risen and the price for some reason 

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:04.719
 grow but the Chinese decided so here 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:08.539
 make the case pretty interesting 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:11.840
 That's how it looks like this handbag with us 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:14.840
 Now I will unpack there for 15 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.400
 inch by 13 by 12 inch that is and 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.620
 even by color there is either 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.910
 but as if at prices when I bought from 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.130
 this seller 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.350
 lips riddik wad scene now you can 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.150
 I will leave a link to this 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.930
 can punch by name if anyone 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:32.900
 need so dense here is such a text 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.330
 such material know dense I think you 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.750
 know how the upholstery in the car is 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:42.080
 such a plan and as far as I know very much 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:45.020
 practical such cheholchik's brand here 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.260
 so here we have to 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:51.320
 cool everything is like that 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.830
 so here even just so here 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.720
 it just opens up here 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.550
 inserted macbook pro 15 inch by 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.610
 I see sizes that everything will fit 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.410
 macbook macbook is not near me therefore 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.100
 We will not try but I think and so everything 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:10.550
 it is clear yes here is such a protective bag 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:14.480
 dense that is even i think if you 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:16.340
 carry a laptop in a backpack designed 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.120
 For him, well, such a cover is never superfluous 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:24.200
 there will be no department and everything is like this 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:26.390
 1 1 1 well, as if under this clasp, I think 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.400
 not so much but she's just cool 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.920
 it looks that's all you can just under 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.080
 hand and drove you have a laptop 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.110
 here of course for charging you understand 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.870
 here nothing will fit just purely pure 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.800
 Such a cover with him is all clear 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:45.500
 quality, in principle, everything is fine 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:47.360
 your money is worth 12 dollars you can 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.810
 buy more but i don't know well 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.840
 Basically there are 13 14 to the more I watched 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.040
 him and on ideas and where not only looked 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.950
 because there at all 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.900
 number as you understand on ebay on macbook 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.870
 but basically they are still going to 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.560
 China and the second package we have is 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:12.320
 hromakey finally I ordered it and 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:14.989
 it cost something there 20 twenty-two dollars 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.430
 imagine I decided to order once 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:19.829
 buy big so that later there wasnâ€™t 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.350
 such that he is missing me and so on 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:25.949
 Well, I think it is not useful 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:28.740
 you only need to decide normal 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:30.780
 housing and then I just do it by 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.580
 normal well and I will shoot the whale 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.190
 videos there to answer any questions any 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.889
 congratulations on a normal background because 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.229
 that as you saw there was a mutko where someone 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:42.840
 sat in the kitchen somewhere else sat 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:47.070
 that is, for chromakey you need a place to eat 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:49.500
 I have an idea so see the size of the meter 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:53.970
 eighty as I figured it out 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:56.669
 he has a width and height of 280 but he is made 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.710
 so you you are on it and become that 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:01.349
 there is if the camera surrendered to yes you are completely 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:04.199
 along with legs in this green background but also 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:07.560
 respectively, then the video editor 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:09.810
 something to add there I don't know which one 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.400
 something like this video 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.280
 just change the picture 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:17.099
 but I always wanted I always wanted but 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:21.240
 somehow everything did not work like this 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:23.570
 now green dense fabric dense she 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:27.090
 completely that is seamless 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:29.430
 that's how there is a piece so he has a piece here 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.470
 here only everything is stitched and everything is as well in 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:35.039
 principle very closely look that is 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:37.949
 the hand is not enlightened at all clearly 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:40.169
 as needed because i know by quality 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:42.800
 eats different but I looked and by reviews and 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:45.810
 in size this was the most such 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:49.199
 adequate money of course 22 dollars was 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:51.930
 it's a pity to give for a piece of cloth but I think 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:54.360
 that it is necessary and useful here such 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.729
 affairs link to chromakey will also be under 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:59.009
 video they are different you can take yourself 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:02.130
 a piece of small that is if you 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:05.099
 do ladies if you like them in frame 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:07.800
 climb here and as if on the background to all 

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:09.870
 it was possible to take a piece of some kind I decided 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.509
 there between these pieces you understand 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.970
 the difference is small and this one is possible 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:17.669
 you can decompose it to the full 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.530
 program or doubly fold here and already 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:21.810
 use as intended but if you 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:23.820
 need more you do more so I 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.969
 still recommend if you buy something 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:29.040
 buy big and then how come 

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:31.780
 because 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.940
 little gap between the prices i get 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.540
 pretty piece all guys all 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.970
 thank 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:39.850
 there already arrived the parcels came to me 

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:41.590
 text messages to a new place already under 5 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:43.860
 subscribers came and so on that is 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:46.750
 here now everything will continue 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:49.780
 barely had a brake i think still being 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:52.030
 slow down because it does not work 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:54.130
 in time all but try everything 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:55.420
