Renault it was very important to have a
system<00:00:56.780> we<00:00:57.260> were<00:00:57.500> sure<00:00:57.920> it<00:00:58.250> worked<00:00:58.640> fine<00:00:59.600> very

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
system we were sure it worked fine very

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.009 
system we were sure it worked fine very
well<00:01:00.710> in<00:01:01.010> an<00:01:01.129> efficient<00:01:01.550> way<00:01:01.580> and<00:01:01.940> we<00:01:02.720> are<00:01:02.870> not

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
well in an efficient way and we are not

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:05.410 
well in an efficient way and we are not
disappointed<00:01:03.500> because<00:01:03.769> this<00:01:04.280> McDonald<00:01:04.850> had<00:01:05.120> a

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
disappointed because this McDonald had a

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.050 
disappointed because this McDonald had a
time<00:01:05.750> a<00:01:06.050> very<00:01:06.800> good<00:01:07.010> system<00:01:07.310> and<00:01:07.490> we<00:01:07.580> had<00:01:07.730> a<00:01:07.760> lot

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
time a very good system and we had a lot

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.899 
time a very good system and we had a lot
of<00:01:08.090> very<00:01:08.960> efficient<00:01:09.380> collaboration

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
of very efficient collaboration

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.490 
of very efficient collaboration
especially<00:01:10.909> especially<00:01:11.260> concerning<00:01:12.260> the

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
especially especially concerning the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.010 
especially especially concerning the
colorimetric<00:01:13.310> calibration<00:01:14.150> I<00:01:14.390> believe<00:01:14.930> it

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
colorimetric calibration I believe it

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.840 
colorimetric calibration I believe it
the<00:01:15.110> best<00:01:15.409> game<00:01:15.500> worldwide<00:01:16.250> it's<00:01:16.760> a

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
the best game worldwide it's a

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.640 
the best game worldwide it's a
world-class<00:01:17.090> system<00:01:17.390> for<00:01:18.020> this<00:01:18.140> cab<00:01:18.350> which<00:01:18.500> is

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
world-class system for this cab which is

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.490 
world-class system for this cab which is
really<00:01:19.040> fantastic<00:01:19.870> that<00:01:20.870> image<00:01:21.320> quality

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
really fantastic that image quality

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.680 
really fantastic that image quality
which<00:01:21.860> means<00:01:22.040> the<00:01:22.250> pixel<00:01:22.729> size<00:01:22.970> is<00:01:23.240> less<00:01:23.479> than

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
which means the pixel size is less than

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.720 
which means the pixel size is less than
one<00:01:23.870> millimeter<00:01:24.110> which<00:01:25.100> means<00:01:25.370> that<00:01:25.520> you<00:01:25.640> are

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:25.730 
one millimeter which means that you are

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.610 
one millimeter which means that you are
very<00:01:26.030> close<00:01:26.360> to<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:26.810> high<00:01:27.350> resolution<00:01:29.440> we<00:01:30.440> see

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
very close to the high resolution we see

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.180 
very close to the high resolution we see
that<00:01:30.770> every<00:01:31.430> year<00:01:32.000> at<00:01:32.240> this<00:01:32.690> time<00:01:32.990> we<00:01:33.350> save<00:01:33.920> two

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
that every year at this time we save two

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.980 
that every year at this time we save two
million<00:01:34.400> euros<00:01:35.000> per<00:01:35.180> Section<00:01:35.510> a<00:01:35.570> cape<00:01:35.780> and

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
million euros per Section a cape and

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.260 
million euros per Section a cape and
probably<00:01:36.440> should<00:01:36.620> be<00:01:36.680> much<00:01:36.890> more<00:01:37.520> in<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:38.150> next

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
probably should be much more in the next

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
probably should be much more in the next

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
listen to us and when it was needed to

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.979 
listen to us and when it was needed to
change<00:03:13.180> according<00:03:14.180> what<00:03:14.329> we<00:03:14.569> really<00:03:14.749> needed

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
change according what we really needed

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.179 
change according what we really needed
to<00:03:15.319> do<00:03:16.219> the<00:03:16.400> best<00:03:16.579> system<00:03:16.999> which<00:03:17.450> was<00:03:18.439> needed

like down we have some ongoing R&amp;D

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.590 
like down we have some ongoing R&amp;D
actions<00:03:45.620> to<00:03:46.620> even<00:03:47.010> better<00:03:47.400> enhance<00:03:47.730> the

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
actions to even better enhance the

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.900 
actions to even better enhance the
future<00:03:48.660> language<00:03:49.230> of<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.650> system<00:03:50.010> but<00:03:50.640> also

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
future language of the system but also

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.060 
future language of the system but also
we<00:03:51.300> are<00:03:51.420> developing<00:03:51.600> some<00:03:52.110> new<00:03:52.380> projects

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
we are developing some new projects

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.920 
we are developing some new projects
so<00:03:53.580> for<00:03:53.760> example<00:03:53.820> we<00:03:54.180> are<00:03:54.240> deploying<00:03:54.600> this

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
so for example we are deploying this

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.920 
so for example we are deploying this
cave<00:03:55.170> technology<00:03:55.710> for<00:03:56.430> our<00:03:56.930> technical

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
cave technology for our technical

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.380 
cave technology for our technical
centers<00:03:58.260> worldwide<00:03:58.650> and<00:03:59.240> hopefully<00:04:00.240> bees

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
centers worldwide and hopefully bees

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.750
