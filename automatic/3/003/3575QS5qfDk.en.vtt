unintentional how weird is that
but<00:00:30.420> I<00:00:30.449> was<00:00:30.599> happy<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.869> do<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.140> that's<00:00:31.619> for<00:00:31.800> a

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
but I was happy to do it that's for a

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.340 
but I was happy to do it that's for a
few<00:00:32.040> reasons<00:00:32.219> one<00:00:32.640> its<00:00:33.300> Looney<00:00:33.690> Tunes<00:00:33.899> I<00:00:34.079> loved

Looney<00:00:34.590> Tunes<00:00:34.860> which<00:00:35.280> brings<00:00:35.550> us<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.700> reason

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
Looney Tunes which brings us to reason

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.020 
Looney Tunes which brings us to reason
two<00:00:36.300> might<00:00:37.050> be<00:00:37.079> wishful<00:00:37.380> thinking<00:00:37.920> but<00:00:38.129> maybe

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
two might be wishful thinking but maybe

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.459 
two might be wishful thinking but maybe
this<00:00:39.239> thing's<00:00:39.480> better<00:00:39.750> than<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:40.020> remember

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
this thing's better than I remember

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.200 
this thing's better than I remember
maybe<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:40.890> was<00:00:41.100> too<00:00:41.250> harsh<00:00:41.489> on<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.820> last<00:00:41.969> year

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
maybe I was too harsh on it last year

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.209 
maybe I was too harsh on it last year
maybe<00:00:42.629> it's<00:00:42.840> actually<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.230> decent<00:00:43.440> platformer

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
maybe it's actually a decent platformer

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.920 
maybe it's actually a decent platformer
that<00:00:44.399> captures<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.969> humor<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.300> style<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.780> the
