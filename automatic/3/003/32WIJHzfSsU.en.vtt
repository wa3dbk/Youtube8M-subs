 Artem Shinkaruk business sales trainer 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.670
 and today we will talk on the subject of the incoming 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.730
 flow namely how to handle 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:18.330
 incoming calls to the company office you 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.029
 know up to 50 percent of all customers 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.600
 is lost precisely because of the wrong 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.750
 work on incoming calls is very frequent 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.210
 situation when the company gives advertising 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:34.320
 Internet billboards outdoor advertising 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.540
 spend the flow of calls calls but 50 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.079
 percent of them are not converted into 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.510
 sales 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.410
 that is, customers fall off on the first 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.390
 contact with a secretary or check who 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.579
 takes a call 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.320
 why so yes because most 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.750
 entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.329
 make one big mistake they're on 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.190
 the phone is lowered the lowest 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.719
 qualified and not trained 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.850
 employee companies are very bad if in 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.220
 There is no defined scenario for the company. 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.790
 conversation patterns and man account 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.490
 get out of the situation as well 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.150
 work on the incoming call very 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.780
 just just three pounds and so the first thing 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:24.229
 need to do this install 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:26.790
 contact with the other person you must 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.590
 to interest your interlocutor because 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.210
 what if a person is not interested he is not 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.049
 will continue to talk with you further 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:37.340
 and the third most important will not go anywhere 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:41.130
 the task is the person who is engaged 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.590
 receiving incoming calls pull it out 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.530
 person to meet or for example 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.890
 record it for examination or on 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.000
 test drive or something else depending 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.829
 from business 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.990
 and so the three main tasks are the first 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.570
 make human contact for this 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.150
 very simple just to be 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.190
 polite do not be rude to people, you will be surprised 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.520
 call the company dial 10 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.930
 companies in 5 6 7 of them will answer you 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.030
 as if you know you are a distracted person 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:16.140
 of some important business t. 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.460
 watched there some serial by 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.190
 computer yes you called here smoke 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.690
 I want to buy your products well, but that's 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.570
 just worth it you want to buy very and 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.070
 buy i have your problems and 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.510
 is engaged further in his affairs that is 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.550
 customer and feeling like for 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.100
 he is not important and just distracts him from 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.960
 important matters 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.760
 so the first is to set a good one 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.860
 contact and the second to interest the person 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.930
 what can you be interested in but just 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.910
 ask him questions lead the conversation here and 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.190
 all this is enough and the third is not 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.709
 forget to pull the person to the meeting 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.260
 or write it down for some free 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:53.530
 consultation or examination by a doctor 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:57.060
 and so on now let's talk 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:00.340

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.850
