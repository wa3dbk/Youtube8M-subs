00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:19.310
 years now we are going to the grandparents 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.439
 commissioned parents already to the initiative and 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.679
 we started to make this art not 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:29.390

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.079
 you are one of those who thought that the art of 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:36.170
 carving in stone ended thousands of years ago 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:38.149
 years in ancient Greece mess you to 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.910
 one side of the road that enters 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.830
 the sultana of the andes riobamba the art 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.500
 national is revealed through 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.510
 of real works of art made 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.630
 manually on the white stones 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:56.140
 of the colossus chimborazo this art is born 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:59.620
 since thousands of years that it has been the 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:03.350
 of stone art that is very well 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.510
 observe the ancient churches that are 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.980
 comes 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.980
 to make the most tender 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.910
 sinks characters quotes and even tombstones 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.400
 to remember the loved ones are 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.440
 some of the work done without 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.110
 However, this entails a series of 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.520
 processes and requirements for example not 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.690
 all stones are used for 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.420
 develop this work 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.220
 to build this this art 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.580
 Firstly 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.800
 we should look for the type of stone and that 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.640
 is going to be done with him 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.170
 in what dimensions is needed because 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.880
 here the works are several a little 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.840
 black stone that is volcanic earth 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.300
 but it is not adequate to make an art 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.620
 the stone the chimborazo is something of zinc 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:58.920
 there something of something that the people the client 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:01.740
 he appreciates you and satyrs 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:06.900
 until it 's hard to start there until 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:10.110
 a child and learn already know everything and 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:13.770
 it's not very difficult if you carved a 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.810
 elephant of an entire turtle of all 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.819
 the details 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.730
 approximately a large sculpture will 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:23.459
 It takes about 2 to 3 months to build the 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.730
 values are according to the size and 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:29.550
 according to what is going is to fight 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.920
 from about 10 dollars 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.480
 to monuments worth 3000 4000 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.110
 Dollars
