00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.790
 the next few years 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.820
 because the mail in an interview 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.030
 this also makes an important reason why not 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.960
 director timo glock 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.520
 with the men 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.640

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.610
 not at all anymore 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.359
 I do see opportunities to bring your business together in the region 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.620
 we don't do this 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.620
 men living in kenya 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.320
 we are not there yet 

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:15.649
 orlando angel 

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:23.149
 but i am satisfied 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.739
 normal though 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.049
 svm 

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:07.789
 the new event 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.869
 that is not true 

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:20.869
 trading on Monday 

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:25.009
 this will happen 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:50.199
 with the Netherlands 

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:52.199
 almere 

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:55.199
 we all have a role as dr 

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:59.019
 we search 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:01.789
 with more than 100 countries 

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:03.439
 Monday and Tuesday 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:05.369
 I worry 

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:08.029
 try to do it under the heading 

00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:10.459
 That is not correct 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.459
 we need our goods 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:39.879
 according to a survey that people 

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:41.990
 the defendant 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.960
 9 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.139
 thereby drove a tree 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.139
 the media 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:54.789
 pure nonsense 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:57.789
 nominate moments 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:00.960
 the strong rise 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.650
 the resident of haarlem 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.650
 both as men and one 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.520
 our rest has a source 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.650
 the most important stronghold of the rebels 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:49.949
 van valleys 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:52.370
 they have a hard time 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.860
 taken the arm to go in all directions 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.240
 Come on man 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.409
 no idea 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:01.650
 is not true 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.830
 that's why we have our union norway 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.819
 the 100 dollars 

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:10.819
 yet not everything 

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:31.009
 this opportunity
