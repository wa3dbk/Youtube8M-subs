00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
 but 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.400
 hello girls welcome well then today 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.330
 I bring you this look more golden 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:19.660
 I've done it with the shadow duo 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.210
 alhambra of the mars that you have 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.070
 asked a lot and it's a look that to me in 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.290
 the golds put so I love this 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.300
 type of looks doing sides in general 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.920
 I'm not about to make up a lot with line 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.900
 black and others but good I wanted 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.190
 give a touch a little more feline 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.620
 but without loading it makes a super look 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.300
 wearable because you wear the shadows 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.859
 golden for life you have a delineated 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.249
 which makes it look like you have more 

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:47.199
 eyelashes and if you seem very burdened the 

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:48.879
 black you can always replace it with a 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:50.559
 brown or even delete the line 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.819
 inside the water that is what makes 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:53.649
 that maybe the makeup is a 

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:56.550
 little bit stronger and that's girls 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:58.230
 I hope you like it and let's start 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.910
 Well, the first thing I'm going to do is 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.350
 apply a shadow test in this 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.760
 case I will use the one of nars that I 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.070
 love the truth is that they last a lot 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.570
 the shadows thank you thanks to this 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.790
 try if I'm going to apply it with my little finger 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.200
 it's like I like it better it's like more 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.700
 like to apply it because it heats the 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.920
 product and it penetrates much better in the 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.570
 eyelid skin now I'm going to apply a 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.869
 Shade in cream in this case is a 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.310
 test point in the soft ocher tone of mac and 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.560
 the same with the little finger is like more 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.869
 like to apply cream shadows what 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.670
 I'm going to apply for the mobile eyelid and what 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.520
 we are going to go up little by little towards 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.140
 the arch of the eyebrow 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.450
 to unify the eyelid a little 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.950
 now with this shadow duo that is 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.679
 He made the one of the night with the most shadow 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.380
 clarita and with a brush to apply 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:42.439
 product this is the 239 of mac because 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.990
 nor do you see how little touches we are going to 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:47.600
 to apply the product 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.450
 so that the pigment penetrates well in the 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.450
 eyelid is valid and we are going to apply it 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.460
 like in about three quarters of the eyelid 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.649
 now with the brochette to blur this 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.659
 is the 217 from amac from side to side we are going to 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:04.030
 blur this shadow well as you see 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.030
 is almost blurred by looking at it 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.130
 it's worth with the other now with the other 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.980
 shadow with which is a little bit more 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.920
 dark let's apply it in the part 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:18.250
 external of the eye with the same brush of 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.230
 apply with 239 and like me in my case 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.820
 I have a lot of space from the 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.440
 mobile eyelid up to my eyebrow I'll 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:27.500
 take it and I'm going to get up pretty 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.780
 you see now again with the brochita and 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.190
 blur from side to side to little circles 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.170
 As you see, I think that the best 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.900
 it's from side to side besides these shadows 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.690
 of narcissus that I already tell you are blurred 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:42.110
 with no effort you see with nothing 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.850
 is super blurred I love now 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.890
 with a clear shadow and in this case 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.510
 from the beautiful duo with the same 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.820
 brush I'm going to apply it under the arch 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.650
 of the eyebrow to illuminate and to be 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:55.460
 they found the two colors and the smoked 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.780
 stay perfect without any cut now 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.150
 with the brochita of these tip 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.620
 This pen is the 219 of mac with the shadow 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.410
 dark of the same duo that we have used 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:07.750
 before I will go arming the bottom line 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.750
 of the eyelashes bit by bit 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.910
 and now in the part of the lacrimal I'm going 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.430
 to apply what was a little bit more 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:20.060
 clarita and we're going to blur everything else 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.510
 Once with a brush blur with the 217 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.510
 of mch 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.370
 now with a black pencil I'm 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.959
 using let's go I always use the 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.690
 ingredient of the power point me 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.790
 they love because they are super durable 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.550
 let's make up the water line to 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.480
 intensify a lot the look and 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.160
 simply with this we already load a 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.800
 little bit more the eye so if you do not 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.880
 like you already know that everything you can 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.880
 skip this step 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.849
 and we're also going to make up a little 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.609
 the flush of the eyelashes for now with the 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:54.859
 same pen tip brochette 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:56.719
 blur it well and here comes the little 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:58.249
 We are going to lengthen this small trick 

00:03:56.719 --> 00:04:00.560
 little corner that you do not worry then it's not going 

00:03:58.249 --> 00:04:02.150
 to stay that way of course we go back to 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.010
 take the pencil and now we're going with the 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.590
 top line that does not go I'm not going 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.800
 make it whole as you see only the part 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.080
 extreme of the eye 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.420
 and again with the tip skewer of 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.090
 boli let's integrate this pencil in the 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.190
 line of the tabs so that the 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.200
 lacrimal is practically almost nothing 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.950
 of product and we join the line below 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:26.910
 with the one above creating this kind of 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.910
 very blurred delineation 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.090
 and now with the skewer to blur what 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.060
 we passed a little bit above so that 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:37.210
 miss the line a bit and create 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:40.200
 this delineated so blurred that to me 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.200
 I personally love it 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.390
 come on let's go with the mascara 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.070
 Now I'm using this bellini 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.390
 cosmetics that I bought at first and the 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.490
 I really like a lot for the 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.880
 price that you have and starts with the 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:57.130
 lower eyelashes so as not to stain the 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.270
 upper eyelid and now we go with the 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.490
 higher 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.870
 I really like to apply a lot of mask 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.690
 of tabs so with patience 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.880
 little by little with a very good impact on 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.650
 root to give a lot of volume and then 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.200
 little by little we go up to create 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:13.360
 also that length that we all 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.020
 like 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.639
 and before it dried it applied a 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.500
 second layer let's say but before that 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:23.050
 dry so they do not create us and lumps 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.469
 and we drop the mascara on 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.469
 the ojera 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.620
 ok let's comb the eyebrows 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.500
 and now when we have the formica the 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.380
 let's outline I'm using the 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.540
 pencil line mac and because either 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.160
 from let's say from the middle of the eyebrow 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.440
 let's go make up the because the 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.850
 Start of the eyebrow does not have either grows 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.010
 a lot of hair then it is not very 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.380
 natural and we are creating the way that 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:54.480
 we have in a very natural way so that 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:56.250
 Integrate the pencil well combing it back 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.960
 let's move on to the skin I followed my 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.790
 complete makeup routine that you 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:03.600
 I will leave the link below and have used 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:07.560
 as blusher the organ of art as 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:09.950
 lipstick I will apply the payment payment of 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.950
 nars 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:18.330
 that as you can see is a jude that has 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:20.430
 a few silver flashes and the truth is 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:23.010
 I like it very much if you do not like 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:25.560
 new good you can change lipstick 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:27.780
 I in this case because I love them 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:30.000
 I have decided to use this other option 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.790
 it would also be the one that for example 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.270
 would love him or mack's angel and that 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.270
 it's all girls 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:53.190
 when you see their empty eyes they look and live 

00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:57.590
 how life has not treated them well 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:07:03.289
 reviewing the photos of our childhood 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:05.979
 we do not lack anything this life is cruel 

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:08.979
 the stars played so many 

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:08.979
 privileged
