00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.920
 my name is thermal male I am 43 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.870
 years old if a child of the ruhr area 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.179
 Some say that is a hurdle to me 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.130
 feel that has an advantage in bochum 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.230
 have studied sports but mine 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.940
 professional focus for many years 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.320
 had professional american football 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.060
 I was there football , among other things 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.529
 Operations Director as well 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.619
 CEO of the football team 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.359
 Rhein fire in the nfl europe have there 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.980
 also with european top athletes 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.529
 worked together and so to speak 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.630
 my hobby athletic trainer speedtrainer 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.969
 parallel to my normal job always 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.110
 then executed myself independently 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.640
 made and currently working 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.550
 mainly as athletics and personal 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.980
 trainer for athletes of all kinds 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.660
 sports and I'm interested in that 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.129
 theme speed in particular because 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.660
 I believe that in Germany this 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.539
 theme speed in many aspects 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.280
 still lies just broke with the players 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.480
 come to the football factory come on 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.539
 to unite the smaller one 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.510
 we want it through our speed camps 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.430
 show that the theme is speed 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.530
 becomes increasingly important and the sooner 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.019
 you start with it the bigger you are 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.400
 Maybe the career opportunities or the 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.229
 development opportunities in youth and 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.970
 amateur football speed is so far 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.619
 important factor if the same good 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.060
 players who play technically equally well 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.530
 are clash is mostly 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.630
 to win the one who is faster 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.189
 either the faster he decides 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.259
 acting faster is faster 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.060
 reacts faster and that's easy 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.810
 aspects that much potential yet 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.640
 contain 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.740
 in other sports such as 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.060
 in football or basketball 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.369
 These things are much more 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.869
 foreground also the training that has 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.210
 in my knowledge, in germany 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.799
 clearly improved nevertheless is the 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.780
 Training time for most children 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.220
 relatively low that is the 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.590
 he will focus on technical 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.090
 put tactical aspects and that goes 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.189
 mostly athletic 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.840
 Education I believe that this topic 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.159
 speed in the next 10 15 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.409
 years to go on and on 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.540
 that's how it will develop 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.909
 theme of speed in connection with 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.530
 a certain competence on the 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.329
 course must move course 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.469
 at the same time, what good is it to me if I am 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.119
 my speed is not below 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.770
 control I have to because I play 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.420
 can or the players do not see 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.490
 that means it has to be hand in hand 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.819
 on the other hand, that is going to develop 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.959
 Just play on the top levels 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:11.940
 decide that the game 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.020
 faster and faster will kick in front of the ball 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.460
 can most 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.290
 however, connections are 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.720
 consistency and in many aspects 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.410
 Completeness it is certainly so 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.540
 that here is the greatest potential 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:28.380
 in the usa, for example , these are 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.790
 fact fact that means you know a lot 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.670
 about the players the players are very 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.910
 glasses businessman child really 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.140
 requirement profiles for the 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.430
 different positions 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.620
 that is not necessarily desirable 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.230
 but I think it makes sense that the 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.240
 player certain aspects of this wide 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.830
 they also become acquainted with feldes 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.420
 understand that under circumstances for 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.550
 it can be a competitive advantage 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.350
 or will be if they are also private 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.360
 to deal with this topic 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.130
 only two alone three times a week 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.960
 make raich for training 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.720
 competitive football and for more 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.190
 certainly not in the future 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.450
 So the physical development of 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.950
 children and adolescents plays naturally 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.410
 A decisive role here are 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.420
 especially worried about the power abilities 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.370
 asked why I try that 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.740
 not isolated in our camps too 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.340
 train we train 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.250
 movement sequences functional 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.960
 Movements and no muscle groups 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.160
 isolated in the sense but we 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.860
 try the pleasant with the 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.810
 useful to connect and in that respect 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.760
 I do not think that you actually 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.790
 early enough with the simple running shoes 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.470
 Things can start to blame the technology 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.610
 proper skills shoes that the 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.709
 a feeling for the players 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.510
 Because of this, movement processes get 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.900
 let's test the players too 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.670
 come up to 20 and 30 meters up to 10 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.320
 and 20 meters with it in theirs 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.910
 age groups can compare 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.650
 we always find children to 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.630
 the top 10 maybe in germany 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.220
 belong without them to great association 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.750
 Here I am of the opinion that belong 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.920
 we with the football factory of ingo 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.540
 anderbrÃ¼gge the right way 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.790
 tread training 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.820
 we want to help the children further 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.290
 open field and agile teenagers 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.450
 interest continue to have this path 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.130
 maybe they will go then 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.200
 Change clubs and get help 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.880
 they are looking for every kind of sport 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.590
 has its specific speed 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.030
 I like to talk about optimal 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.489
 speed or better 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.520
 speed every sport he has his 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:16.260
 particularities 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.790
 special speed to train 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.799
 lies in the competence and the 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.630
 experience of the trainer the 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.800
 special feature of his sport 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.810
 that also means here 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.570
 in perspective to think the player 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.640
 does not have to be fast with 12 13 14 15 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.440
 and be done but then if he does 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.170
 reached its peak performance with 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.820
 16 17 18 19 maybe many coaches 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.680
 do not make the mistake in perspective 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.660
 to think that means we would like to 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.550
 also help this topic for others 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.200
 sport interesting to do basis 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.520
 How to do the work 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.200
 speed maybe in the normal 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.540
 can involve training 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.430
 because it will no longer be in germany 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.200
 the only one to be trained in the future 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.030
 What you can do it is training too 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.210
 optimize and maybe aspects of 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.370
 speed earlier with meaning too 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.990
 provided that children and adolescents in 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.970
 the different sports already 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.260
 earlier with the topic of speed and 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.260
 precision in contact
