00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.060 
4's 9.1 keep in mind though what I'm
saying<00:02:31.720> now<00:02:31.870> could<00:02:32.110> possibly<00:02:32.560> change<00:02:32.890> in<00:02:33.010> my

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
saying now could possibly change in my

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.950 
saying now could possibly change in my
review<00:02:33.460> so<00:02:33.880> we<00:02:33.940> definitely<00:02:34.120> stay<00:02:34.480> tuned<00:02:34.780> and

don't<00:02:35.320> take<00:02:35.440> this<00:02:35.620> unboxing<00:02:36.220> and<00:02:36.370> first<00:02:36.490> look

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
don't take this unboxing and first look

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.760 
don't take this unboxing and first look
is<00:02:37.000> my<00:02:37.390> concrete<00:02:37.750> opinions<00:02:38.260> because<00:02:38.500> they

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
is my concrete opinions because they

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.490 
is my concrete opinions because they
definitely<00:02:39.040> could<00:02:39.280> change<00:02:39.580> also<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:41.140> back<00:02:41.320> of

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
definitely could change also the back of

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.890 
definitely could change also the back of
the<00:02:41.560> s4<00:02:41.920> doesn't<00:02:42.370> feel<00:02:42.520> too<00:02:42.670> bad<00:02:42.910> everyone

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
the s4 doesn't feel too bad everyone

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.600 
the s4 doesn't feel too bad everyone
seems<00:02:44.140> to<00:02:44.230> be<00:02:44.320> making<00:02:44.500> a<00:02:44.710> huge<00:02:45.070> deal<00:02:45.280> about<00:02:45.430> the

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
seems to be making a huge deal about the
