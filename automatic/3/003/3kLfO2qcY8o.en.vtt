00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
triple feed and I should have been a

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.500 
triple feed and I should have been a
quad<00:02:09.840> feed<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.410> it<00:02:10.530> was<00:02:10.649> my<00:02:10.860> fault<00:02:10.920> but<00:02:11.610> i<00:02:11.910> miss

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
like it's a it's a little bit smoother

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.530 
like it's a it's a little bit smoother
less<00:02:18.810> like<00:02:19.050> year

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
less like year

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.050 
less like year
there's<00:02:21.140> sometimes<00:02:21.739> there's<00:02:22.310> less<00:02:22.549> bull<00:02:22.790> crap

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
there's sometimes there's less bull crap

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.630 
there's sometimes there's less bull crap
but<00:02:23.299> sometimes<00:02:23.799> there's<00:02:24.799> those<00:02:25.040> guys<00:02:25.280> with

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
but sometimes there's those guys with

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.619 
but sometimes there's those guys with
heartbeat<00:02:26.510> sensors<00:02:26.930> and<00:02:27.640> blind<00:02:28.640> eye<00:02:28.909> sasson

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:29.629 
heartbeat sensors and blind eye sasson

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:32.110 
heartbeat sensors and blind eye sasson
on<00:02:29.750> and<00:02:30.019> it's<00:02:30.140> it's<00:02:30.590> pretty<00:02:31.159> annoying<00:02:31.459> but

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
on and it's it's pretty annoying but

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.580 
on and it's it's pretty annoying but
normally<00:02:32.480> they're<00:02:32.659> camping<00:02:33.109> so<00:02:33.319> they're<00:02:33.469> not

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
normally they're camping so they're not

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.679 
normally they're camping so they're not
going<00:02:33.739> to<00:02:33.829> be<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.099> ones<00:02:34.310> that<00:02:34.430> win<00:02:34.760> they<00:02:35.480> don't

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:35.689 
going to be the ones that win they don't

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:38.110 
going to be the ones that win they don't
run<00:02:36.079> around<00:02:36.200> with<00:02:36.530> that<00:02:36.680> normally<00:02:37.129> and<00:02:37.340> I

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
run around with that normally and I

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.360 
run around with that normally and I
think<00:02:38.780> there's<00:02:38.959> a<00:02:39.019> guy<00:02:39.260> it<00:02:39.680> wasn't<00:02:40.040> either<00:02:40.159> on

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
think there's a guy it wasn't either on

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.849 
think there's a guy it wasn't either on
this<00:02:40.519> one<00:02:40.700> or<00:02:40.819> a<00:02:40.879> different<00:02:41.239> one<00:02:41.269> but<00:02:41.709> he<00:02:42.709> was

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:42.859 
this one or a different one but he was

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:45.420 
this one or a different one but he was
camping<00:02:43.189> his<00:02:43.340> brains<00:02:43.609> out<00:02:43.819> yeah<00:02:44.450> thermal<00:02:45.109> on<00:02:45.260> a

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
camping his brains out yeah thermal on a

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.420 
camping his brains out yeah thermal on a
ACR<00:02:46.430> it<00:02:47.269> was<00:02:47.480> just<00:02:47.659> in<00:02:47.870> bondi<00:02:48.439> assassin<00:02:49.129> and

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
ACR it was just in bondi assassin and

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.800 
ACR it was just in bondi assassin and
heartbeat<00:02:49.790> sensor<00:02:49.939> is<00:02:50.209> just<00:02:50.450> like<00:02:50.569> what<00:02:50.719> are

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
heartbeat sensor is just like what are

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.379 
heartbeat sensor is just like what are
you<00:02:50.870> doing<00:02:51.260> dude<00:02:51.439> like<00:02:51.769> and<00:02:52.730> he<00:02:52.909> probably<00:02:53.120> had

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:53.389 
you doing dude like and he probably had

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:55.030 
you doing dude like and he probably had
about<00:02:53.510> 10<00:02:53.870> kills<00:02:54.170> throughout<00:02:54.799> the<00:02:54.920> whole

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
about 10 kills throughout the whole

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.460 
about 10 kills throughout the whole
thing<00:02:55.280> but<00:02:55.519> I<00:02:55.730> mean<00:02:55.939> I<00:02:56.269> just<00:02:56.540> don't<00:02:56.930> understand

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
thing but I mean I just don't understand

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.909 
thing but I mean I just don't understand
people<00:02:57.709> like<00:02:57.950> that<00:02:58.280> but<00:02:59.530> assassin<00:03:00.530> has

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:00.919 
people like that but assassin has

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:03.129 
people like that but assassin has
definitely<00:03:01.489> seen<00:03:01.879> that<00:03:02.150> it's<00:03:02.419> it's<00:03:02.689> starting

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:03.139 
definitely seen that it's it's starting

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:04.979 
definitely seen that it's it's starting
to<00:03:03.230> take<00:03:03.409> over<00:03:03.530> the<00:03:03.650> game<00:03:03.889> for<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:04.340> most<00:03:04.519> part

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
to take over the game for the most part

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.789 
to take over the game for the most part
it's<00:03:05.989> it's<00:03:06.290> in<00:03:06.620> my<00:03:07.280> opinion<00:03:08.109> it's<00:03:09.109> overpowered

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
it's it's in my opinion it's overpowered

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:14.229 
it's it's in my opinion it's overpowered
simply<00:03:10.579> because<00:03:11.139> okay<00:03:12.139> you're<00:03:12.829> immune<00:03:13.579> to<00:03:13.609> UAV

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
simply because okay you're immune to UAV

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.300 
simply because okay you're immune to UAV
that's<00:03:15.019> just<00:03:15.319> like<00:03:15.470> ghosts<00:03:15.739> and<00:03:16.010> all<00:03:16.040> that

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
that's just like ghosts and all that

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.330 
that's just like ghosts and all that
that's<00:03:16.879> normal<00:03:17.120> but<00:03:17.810> then<00:03:17.870> I<00:03:18.079> added<00:03:18.439> on<00:03:18.709> to<00:03:18.980> the

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
that's normal but then I added on to the

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.839 
that's normal but then I added on to the
pro<00:03:19.909> version<00:03:19.939> is<00:03:20.629> immune<00:03:21.500> to<00:03:21.530> counter<00:03:22.400> UAV<00:03:22.549> and

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849 
pro version is immune to counter UAV and

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:25.619 
pro version is immune to counter UAV and
EMP<00:03:23.419> I<00:03:23.900> don't<00:03:24.500> think<00:03:24.590> anyone<00:03:25.040> should<00:03:25.069> be

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:25.629 
EMP I don't think anyone should be

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:28.089 
EMP I don't think anyone should be
immune<00:03:26.629> to<00:03:26.659> EMP<00:03:27.199> that's<00:03:27.440> absolutely

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
immune to EMP that's absolutely

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.110 
immune to EMP that's absolutely
ridiculous<00:03:28.549> and<00:03:29.090> overpower<00:03:29.629> to<00:03:29.930> the<00:03:30.019> max<00:03:30.290> and

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
ridiculous and overpower to the max and

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.369 
ridiculous and overpower to the max and
they're<00:03:32.120> just<00:03:32.409> for<00:03:33.409> the<00:03:33.919> tier<00:03:34.250> to<00:03:34.729> park

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:35.379 
they're just for the tier to park

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:38.680 
they're just for the tier to park
assassin<00:03:36.379> is<00:03:36.590> the<00:03:37.489> best<00:03:37.729> bang<00:03:38.120> for<00:03:38.150> buck

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
assassin is the best bang for buck

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
you get the throw grenades and zoom in

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.129 
you get the throw grenades and zoom in
faster<00:03:45.440> but<00:03:45.799> that's<00:03:46.220> all<00:03:46.430> with<00:03:47.329> assassin<00:03:47.959> pro

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:48.139

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
none of it really compares and you can

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.400 
none of it really compares and you can
tell<00:04:22.640> that<00:04:22.970> people<00:04:23.660> are<00:04:23.780> realizing<00:04:24.290> that

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
tell that people are realizing that

because<00:04:25.190> I'm<00:04:25.790> probably<00:04:26.450> about<00:04:26.840> five<00:04:27.170> out<00:04:27.380> of

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
perk and it's quite annoying but I mean
