00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
that's a nice diagnostic is that these

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.060 
that's a nice diagnostic is that these
things<00:01:15.299> if<00:01:15.509> she<00:01:15.659> can<00:01:15.840> lengthen<00:01:16.110> from<00:01:16.830> both

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070

I'm<00:01:18.060> stabilized<00:01:18.570> but<00:01:18.840> she<00:01:18.960> could<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.770> was<00:01:19.979> a

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
I'm stabilized but she could it was a

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.380 
I'm stabilized but she could it was a
good<00:01:20.250> diagnostic<00:01:20.580> about<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.119> shoulder

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390

in the right place in the sling and this

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.690 
in the right place in the sling and this
is<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.380> big<00:01:55.680> deal<00:01:55.920> because<00:01:56.189> we<00:01:56.399> see<00:01:56.520> people

motion requirement issues she just needs

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.630

to<00:02:03.719> let<00:02:03.780> this<00:02:03.930> thing<00:02:03.990> heal<00:02:04.350> up<00:02:04.560> so<00:02:04.799> what<00:02:05.549> we've

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
to let this thing heal up so what we've

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.340 
to let this thing heal up so what we've
done<00:02:05.790> is<00:02:05.909> replaced<00:02:06.270> her<00:02:06.390> elbow<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.990> back

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
done is replaced her elbow to the back

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.809 
done is replaced her elbow to the back
of<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.799> sling<00:02:08.099> where<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.310> belongs

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
of the sling where it belongs

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.279 
of the sling where it belongs
now<00:02:09.119> think<00:02:09.390> about<00:02:09.479> what<00:02:09.629> we're<00:02:09.810> doing<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:10.110> lot

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
now think about what we're doing a lot

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.100 
now think about what we're doing a lot
of<00:02:10.379> times<00:02:10.590> we<00:02:11.039> park<00:02:11.370> our<00:02:11.489> hands<00:02:11.910> here<00:02:12.360> we're

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
of times we park our hands here we're

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.030 
of times we park our hands here we're
able<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.470> stable

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
able to stable

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.610 
able to stable
that<00:02:14.610> lets<00:02:14.819> the<00:02:14.909> extra<00:02:15.360> rotation<00:02:15.569> take<00:02:16.230> effect

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
that lets the extra rotation take effect

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.619 
that lets the extra rotation take effect
we<00:02:17.069> take<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.280> lot<00:02:17.489> of<00:02:17.519> load<00:02:17.849> off<00:02:18.090> these<00:02:18.269> anterior

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
we take a lot of load off these anterior

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.740 
we take a lot of load off these anterior
structures<00:02:18.930> right<00:02:19.769> so<00:02:19.980> imagine<00:02:20.640> that<00:02:21.569> that

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
structures right so imagine that that

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.509 
structures right so imagine that that
sling<00:02:22.140> it's<00:02:22.530> just<00:02:22.680> going<00:02:22.799> to<00:02:22.890> support<00:02:23.310> that

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
sling it's just going to support that

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.009 
sling it's just going to support that
joint<00:02:23.849> so<00:02:24.000> we<00:02:24.090> can<00:02:24.209> let<00:02:24.299> everything<00:02:24.510> chill<00:02:24.870> out

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
joint so we can let everything chill out

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.869 
joint so we can let everything chill out
not<00:02:25.290> freak<00:02:25.650> out<00:02:25.799> which<00:02:26.220> means<00:02:26.430> that<00:02:26.670> we<00:02:26.760> want

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
not freak out which means that we want

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.729 
not freak out which means that we want
the<00:02:27.090> hand<00:02:27.360> kind<00:02:28.200> of<00:02:28.290> roughly<00:02:28.620> in<00:02:28.680> this

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
the hand kind of roughly in this

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.350 
the hand kind of roughly in this
position<00:02:29.129> it<00:02:29.250> was<00:02:29.370> almost<00:02:29.610> like<00:02:29.849> on<00:02:30.030> top<00:02:30.209> of

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
position it was almost like on top of

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.910 
position it was almost like on top of
her<00:02:30.450> body<00:02:30.480> armor<00:02:31.079> this<00:02:31.709> should<00:02:31.829> be<00:02:31.890> a

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
her body armor this should be a

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.699 
her body armor this should be a
fantastic<00:02:32.430> position<00:02:33.299> so<00:02:33.900> elbow<00:02:34.319> goes<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.620> the

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
fantastic position so elbow goes to the

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.619 
fantastic position so elbow goes to the
back<00:02:34.860> of<00:02:35.069> the<00:02:35.129> sling<00:02:35.459> this<00:02:36.120> is<00:02:36.239> also<00:02:36.390> going<00:02:36.569> to

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
back of the sling this is also going to

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.539 
back of the sling this is also going to
allow<00:02:36.720> her<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:36.959> get<00:02:37.140> her<00:02:37.260> shoulders<00:02:37.769> into<00:02:38.519> a

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
allow her to get her shoulders into a

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:39.589 
allow her to get her shoulders into a
bad<00:02:38.760> position<00:02:38.879> she<00:02:39.180> should<00:02:39.329> be<00:02:39.390> home<00:02:39.540> in

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
bad position she should be home in

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.030 
bad position she should be home in
better<00:02:39.780> position<00:02:40.109> there<00:02:40.530> it<00:02:40.650> is<00:02:40.739> and<00:02:41.010> that

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
better position there it is and that

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.589 
better position there it is and that
makes<00:02:41.519> a<00:02:41.609> big<00:02:41.640> difference<00:02:42.030> because<00:02:42.150> if<00:02:42.420> she's

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
makes a big difference because if she's

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.809 
makes a big difference because if she's
programming<00:02:43.290> herself<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:43.890> walk<00:02:44.040> around<00:02:44.220> and

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
programming herself to walk around and

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.940 
programming herself to walk around and
get<00:02:45.209> stiff<00:02:45.510> in<00:02:45.689> a<00:02:45.900> less<00:02:46.409> than<00:02:46.440> optimal

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
get stiff in a less than optimal

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.470 
get stiff in a less than optimal
position<00:02:47.400> that's<00:02:48.030> what<00:02:48.150> we're<00:02:48.239> gonna<00:02:48.329> get

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
position that's what we're gonna get

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.119 
position that's what we're gonna get
afterwards<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:49.019> we<00:02:49.290> have<00:02:49.440> to<00:02:49.530> undo<00:02:49.739> that<00:02:49.920> so

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
afterwards and we have to undo that so

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.129 
afterwards and we have to undo that so
we<00:02:50.519> know<00:02:50.670> what<00:02:50.790> everyone<00:02:51.060> after<00:02:51.480> surgeries

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:52.139 
we know what everyone after surgeries

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:53.569 
we know what everyone after surgeries
for<00:02:52.260> an<00:02:52.379> athlete<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.769> end<00:02:52.920> up<00:02:53.069> in<00:02:53.220> a<00:02:53.310> worse

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
for an athlete to end up in a worse

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.420 
for an athlete to end up in a worse
position<00:02:53.900> so<00:02:54.900> she<00:02:55.260> comes<00:02:55.470> around<00:02:55.590> she<00:02:56.310> can

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
position so she comes around she can

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.300 
position so she comes around she can
hook<00:02:56.519> this<00:02:56.700> thing<00:02:57.230> runs<00:02:58.230> it<00:02:58.379> through<00:02:58.560> this

aware of do you right now have a strap
on<00:03:05.129> your<00:03:05.190> neck<00:03:05.459> yeah<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.209> first<00:03:06.420> time<00:03:06.540> in<00:03:06.720> a

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
on your neck yeah the first time in a

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.050 
on your neck yeah the first time in a
long<00:03:06.870> time<00:03:07.139> right<00:03:07.980> so<00:03:08.129> one<00:03:08.700> of<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.849> things

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
long time right so one of the things

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.729 
long time right so one of the things
that<00:03:09.209> she<00:03:09.510> is<00:03:09.540> going<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:09.959> get<00:03:10.079> tight<00:03:10.349> up<00:03:10.680> here

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
that she is going to get tight up here

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.890 
that she is going to get tight up here
on<00:03:11.129> the<00:03:11.250> neck<00:03:11.459> we'll<00:03:12.060> see<00:03:12.209> where<00:03:12.329> that<00:03:12.420> ties<00:03:12.659> in

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
on the neck we'll see where that ties in

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.899 
on the neck we'll see where that ties in
way<00:03:13.530> back<00:03:13.769> there<00:03:15.049> so<00:03:16.310> she<00:03:17.310> may<00:03:17.430> need<00:03:17.549> to<00:03:17.609> not

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:17.909 
way back there so she may need to not

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:20.629 
way back there so she may need to not
this<00:03:18.180> to<00:03:18.720> get<00:03:18.870> it<00:03:18.959> tight<00:03:19.199> enough<00:03:19.470> because<00:03:20.160> the

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639 
this to get it tight enough because the

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:22.819 
this to get it tight enough because the
velcro<00:03:20.910> is<00:03:21.299> not<00:03:21.510> intuitively<00:03:22.019> obvious<00:03:22.199> where

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
velcro is not intuitively obvious where

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:24.830 
velcro is not intuitively obvious where
that<00:03:22.980> goes<00:03:23.129> and<00:03:23.400> if<00:03:23.849> she<00:03:24.000> doesn't<00:03:24.419> have<00:03:24.569> an<00:03:24.690> on

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
that goes and if she doesn't have an on

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.390 
that goes and if she doesn't have an on
tight<00:03:25.260> enough<00:03:25.379> it<00:03:25.590> will<00:03:25.650> drop<00:03:25.859> down<00:03:25.919> I<00:03:26.220> want

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
tight enough it will drop down I want

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.780 
tight enough it will drop down I want
the<00:03:26.489> elbow<00:03:26.849> back<00:03:27.480> of<00:03:27.720> the<00:03:27.810> sling<00:03:28.220> hand<00:03:29.220> in<00:03:29.669> a

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
the elbow back of the sling hand in a

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.550 
the elbow back of the sling hand in a
position<00:03:30.120> where<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:30.930> elbow<00:03:31.139> is<00:03:31.379> being

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
position where the elbow is being

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.589 
position where the elbow is being
supported<00:03:32.250> and<00:03:32.879> though<00:03:33.030> she<00:03:33.180> did<00:03:33.449> not<00:03:33.540> just

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
supported and though she did not just

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:34.879 
supported and though she did not just
feel<00:03:33.900> different<00:03:34.169> in<00:03:34.260> your<00:03:34.349> shoulder<00:03:34.650> doesn't

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
feel different in your shoulder doesn't

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:37.640 
feel different in your shoulder doesn't
matter<00:03:35.099> feels<00:03:35.669> better<00:03:36.000> that's<00:03:36.660> the<00:03:36.900> goal<00:03:37.079> so

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
matter feels better that's the goal so

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.280 
matter feels better that's the goal so
try<00:03:38.040> to<00:03:38.069> let<00:03:38.340> that<00:03:38.489> joint<00:03:38.879> get<00:03:39.690> some<00:03:39.900> breathing

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
try to let that joint get some breathing

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.930 
try to let that joint get some breathing
room<00:03:40.319> and<00:03:40.590> take<00:03:40.949> all<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.370> pressure<00:03:41.609> off<00:03:41.790> the

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
room and take all the pressure off the

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.300 
room and take all the pressure off the
tissues<00:03:42.209> it's<00:03:42.359> like<00:03:42.480> having<00:03:42.780> a<00:03:42.840> big<00:03:43.310> scabby

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
tissues it's like having a big scabby

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.309 
tissues it's like having a big scabby
wound<00:03:45.120> like<00:03:45.389> you<00:03:45.540> scraped<00:03:45.780> your<00:03:45.840> knee<00:03:45.989> inside

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
wound like you scraped your knee inside

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:47.539 
wound like you scraped your knee inside
there<00:03:46.470> we<00:03:46.590> need<00:03:46.709> to<00:03:46.769> let<00:03:46.859> the<00:03:46.980> surgical<00:03:47.430> time

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
there we need to let the surgical time

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.699 
there we need to let the surgical time
heal<00:03:47.760> you<00:03:47.970> don't<00:03:48.209> win<00:03:48.389> any<00:03:48.599> points<00:03:49.049> you<00:03:49.560> can

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
heal you don't win any points you can

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:50.900 
heal you don't win any points you can
optimize<00:03:50.040> your<00:03:50.340> physiology

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
optimize your physiology

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.089 
optimize your physiology
you<00:03:51.449> can't<00:03:51.690> outrace<00:03:52.199> your<00:03:52.410> physiology<00:03:52.889> so<00:03:53.010> at

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
you can't outrace your physiology so at

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:54.409 
you can't outrace your physiology so at
the<00:03:53.190> bottom<00:03:53.370> line<00:03:53.669> is<00:03:53.849> we<00:03:53.970> want<00:03:54.000> to<00:03:54.150> give<00:03:54.299> her

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:54.419 
the bottom line is we want to give her

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:56.420 
the bottom line is we want to give her
an<00:03:54.540> option<00:03:54.870> that<00:03:54.900> one<00:03:55.199> keeps<00:03:56.129> her<00:03:56.310> in<00:03:56.370> a

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
an option that one keeps her in a

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.830 
an option that one keeps her in a
comfortable<00:03:56.730> position<00:03:56.909> so<00:03:57.480> we<00:03:57.540> don't<00:03:57.659> have<00:03:57.750> to

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
comfortable position so we don't have to

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.720 
comfortable position so we don't have to
deal<00:03:58.379> with<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:58.560> spasm<00:03:59.040> or<00:03:59.129> deal<00:03:59.310> tight<00:03:59.549> neck

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
deal with the spasm or deal tight neck

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.000 
deal with the spasm or deal tight neck
to<00:04:00.060> protects<00:04:00.540> her<00:04:00.720> and<00:04:01.169> puts<00:04:01.379> the<00:04:01.470> joint<00:04:01.769> into

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
to protects her and puts the joint into

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.250 
to protects her and puts the joint into
its<00:04:02.129> best<00:04:02.549> kind<00:04:02.909> of<00:04:02.970> congruence<00:04:03.389> position<00:04:03.750> so

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
its best kind of congruence position so

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.470 
its best kind of congruence position so
what<00:04:04.409> if<00:04:04.889> you<00:04:05.280> had<00:04:05.609> someone<00:04:05.849> to<00:04:06.030> support<00:04:06.419> your

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
what if you had someone to support your

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.659 
what if you had someone to support your
elbow<00:04:06.599> a<00:04:06.780> little<00:04:06.840> bit<00:04:07.139> like<00:04:07.379> feels<00:04:07.980> amazing

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:08.669 
elbow a little bit like feels amazing

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:10.309 
elbow a little bit like feels amazing
she<00:04:09.060> does<00:04:09.180> have<00:04:09.269> a<00:04:09.359> big<00:04:09.510> block<00:04:09.810> here<00:04:10.109> so<00:04:10.229> we're

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
she does have a big block here so we're

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.140 
she does have a big block here so we're
not<00:04:10.349> worried<00:04:10.620> about<00:04:10.650> her<00:04:10.889> going<00:04:11.040> too<00:04:11.340> far<00:04:11.609> but

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
not worried about her going too far but

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.369 
not worried about her going too far but
we<00:04:12.269> just<00:04:12.419> want<00:04:12.540> to<00:04:12.599> support<00:04:12.840> the<00:04:12.930> turnable<00:04:13.199> bit

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 
we just want to support the turnable bit

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:15.289 
we just want to support the turnable bit
so<00:04:13.500> she<00:04:13.620> can<00:04:13.949> now<00:04:14.069> optimize<00:04:14.669> that<00:04:14.849> position<00:04:15.209> go

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
so she can now optimize that position go

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:16.939 
so she can now optimize that position go
ahead<00:04:15.329> optimize<00:04:15.780> the<00:04:15.870> strap<00:04:16.109> where<00:04:16.560> you<00:04:16.680> think

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
ahead optimize the strap where you think

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:18.710 
ahead optimize the strap where you think
you<00:04:17.039> would<00:04:17.159> want<00:04:17.370> it<00:04:17.489> that<00:04:17.669> means<00:04:18.539> you<00:04:18.630> might

you would want it that means you might

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.229 
you would want it that means you might
have<00:04:18.780> to<00:04:18.959> fiddle<00:04:19.169> with<00:04:19.320> it<00:04:19.409> a<00:04:19.530> little<00:04:19.620> bit

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
have to fiddle with it a little bit

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.969 
have to fiddle with it a little bit
dummy<00:04:21.239> sense<00:04:21.539> right<00:04:22.019> and<00:04:22.349> that<00:04:22.469> feels<00:04:22.710> very

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
dummy sense right and that feels very

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.080 
dummy sense right and that feels very
different<00:04:23.159> than<00:04:23.400> what<00:04:23.490> you<00:04:23.550> had<00:04:23.700> in<00:04:23.820> it<00:04:23.880> below

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
in rocking a compression bed preciously

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.690 
in rocking a compression bed preciously
where's<00:05:25.260> that<00:05:25.410> where<00:05:25.950> did<00:05:26.100> it<00:05:26.130> go<00:05:26.340> you<00:05:26.610> can

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:26.700 
where's that where did it go you can

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.370 
where's that where did it go you can
take<00:05:26.730> it<00:05:26.940> take<00:05:27.120> that<00:05:27.300> off<00:05:28.040> right<00:05:30.140> so<00:05:31.140> we've<00:05:31.260> got

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
take it take that off right so we've got

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.260 
take it take that off right so we've got
two<00:05:31.770> times<00:05:31.980> you<00:05:32.130> compression<00:05:32.580> sleeve<00:05:32.970> which

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
two times you compression sleeve which

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
two times you compression sleeve which
you<00:05:33.419> probably<00:05:33.690> had<00:05:33.810> liner<00:05:33.990> on<00:05:34.140> the<00:05:34.169> house

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
you probably had liner on the house

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.070 
you probably had liner on the house
anyway<00:05:34.590> that<00:05:34.770> of<00:05:35.280> course<00:05:35.490> natural<00:05:36.120> force<00:05:36.330> we

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
anyway that of course natural force we

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.110 
anyway that of course natural force we
have<00:05:37.230> to<00:05:37.320> get<00:05:37.470> er<00:05:37.500> one<00:05:37.710> but<00:05:38.460> the<00:05:38.790> bottom<00:05:39.090> line

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
have to get er one but the bottom line

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.900 
have to get er one but the bottom line
is<00:05:39.419> let's<00:05:40.050> advance<00:05:40.380> of<00:05:41.100> as<00:05:41.370> much<00:05:41.550> compression

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
is let's advance of as much compression

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.520 
is let's advance of as much compression
now<00:05:42.210> the<00:05:42.270> mechanism<00:05:42.780> for<00:05:43.169> clearing<00:05:43.410> all<00:05:43.500> the

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
now the mechanism for clearing all the

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.070 
now the mechanism for clearing all the
ceiling<00:05:44.010> is<00:05:44.220> this<00:05:44.669> lymphatic<00:05:45.090> system<00:05:45.390> and<00:05:45.540> so

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
ceiling is this lymphatic system and so

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.350 
ceiling is this lymphatic system and so
it's<00:05:46.260> the<00:05:46.380> muscle<00:05:46.770> contraction<00:05:47.180> that's<00:05:48.180> going

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
it's the muscle contraction that's going

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.060 
it's the muscle contraction that's going
to<00:05:48.450> clear<00:05:48.720> these<00:05:48.900> one-way<00:05:49.290> valves<00:05:49.740> and<00:05:49.860> dump

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
to clear these one-way valves and dump

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.710 
to clear these one-way valves and dump
all<00:05:50.250> of<00:05:50.340> the<00:05:50.430> swelling<00:05:50.669> it's<00:05:51.240> not<00:05:51.419> just<00:05:51.630> going

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
all of the swelling it's not just going

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.480 
all of the swelling it's not just going
to<00:05:51.810> clear<00:05:51.990> itself<00:05:52.230> and<00:05:52.830> what<00:05:52.950> happens<00:05:53.340> if<00:05:53.460> she

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
to clear itself and what happens if she

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.310 
to clear itself and what happens if she
gets<00:05:53.790> congested<00:05:54.030> and<00:05:54.570> this<00:05:54.690> tissue<00:05:54.960> remains

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 
gets congested and this tissue remains

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.040 
gets congested and this tissue remains
congested<00:05:55.860> we<00:05:55.980> get<00:05:56.100> poor<00:05:56.900> garbage<00:05:57.900> out

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
congested we get poor garbage out

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.620 
congested we get poor garbage out
grocery<00:05:58.530> in<00:05:58.650> phenomenon<00:05:59.190> and<00:05:59.520> in<00:06:00.150> the<00:06:00.240> tissues

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
grocery in phenomenon and in the tissues

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.270 
grocery in phenomenon and in the tissues
especially<00:06:00.960> in<00:06:01.380> these<00:06:01.470> insertion<00:06:01.980> pieces

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 
especially in these insertion pieces

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.470 
especially in these insertion pieces
even<00:06:02.790> though<00:06:02.820> they<00:06:02.940> didn't<00:06:03.090> have<00:06:03.180> to<00:06:03.270> cut<00:06:03.390> the

even though they didn't have to cut the

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.730 
even though they didn't have to cut the
muscles<00:06:03.840> they<00:06:03.930> still<00:06:04.110> went<00:06:04.260> through<00:06:04.500> all<00:06:04.590> the
