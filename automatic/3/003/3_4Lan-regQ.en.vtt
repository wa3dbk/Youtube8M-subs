 if you were smearing butter for 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:36.330

 applying 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:49.350
 in this very simple way and practice 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:52.240

 as you can see here 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:12.140
 I will proceed in this way look at 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:15.310
 play with the design is practically 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.900
 created by you can do 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.910
 different classes in this case I'm going to 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.910
 make the same from the box 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:31.450
 he grabbed him cross it in this way and as 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.450
 the pasta is fresh 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.830
 and new outputs 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.390
 I reapply 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:50.400
 and in this way I am applying it 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:54.630
 Once applied it is allowed to dry until the day 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:57.350
 tomorrow I will proceed to paint the 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.930
 part of here 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:03.780

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.890
 white and black paint 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:14.540
 proceed in this way look with a 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.960
 sponge and I will proceed to make this 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.960
 shape 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:30.570
 look how nice it looks 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:33.810

 with two kinds of paint I do again 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.650
 in the same way 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.650
 the other edge 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.980
 once applied all this part and 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:55.340
 Applied 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:59.290
 all this part here I already have a box 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.290
 practically made dry 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:05.660
 Here I have my pen painting which 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.540
 mixed with a little bit of English I'm going to 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:11.540

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:15.730

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.730
 mixed with a little bit of beige 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:32.490
 once I mix I take my sponge 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:40.930
 and I will proceed to try these pictures 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.930

 to be noticed in this way 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.890
 I'm getting a little bit of grace 

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:16.639
 and I'll return 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:21.900
 so you can notice the texture that 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.800
 is what we want 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.800

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.920
 I will apply again in this way 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:24.420
 until I stay as you can see 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:27.320

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:30.170
