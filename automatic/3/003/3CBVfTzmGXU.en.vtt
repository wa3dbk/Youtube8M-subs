00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:07.309 
so here's another video with my engine

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:12.589 
so here's another video with my engine
41<00:00:08.309> after<00:00:09.559> more<00:00:10.559> than<00:00:10.590> 30<00:00:11.130> minutes<00:00:11.599> and

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
41 after more than 30 minutes and

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:19.910 
41 after more than 30 minutes and
fortunately<00:00:14.540> having<00:00:16.160> clean<00:00:17.160> my<00:00:18.650> ICV<00:00:19.650> and

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
fortunately having clean my ICV and

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.890 
fortunately having clean my ICV and
replacing<00:00:20.880> my<00:00:21.090> camshaft<00:00:21.960> exhaust<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:22.980> saw

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
replacing my camshaft exhaust and saw

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.620 
replacing my camshaft exhaust and saw
doesn't<00:00:24.900> seem<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.470> have<00:00:26.070> improved<00:00:26.849> as<00:00:27.269> much<00:00:27.330> as

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
doesn't seem to have improved as much as

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.479 
doesn't seem to have improved as much as
I<00:00:28.019> wanted<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:29.039> ID<00:00:29.699> on<00:00:30.560> when<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:32.070> engine<00:00:32.399> is

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
I wanted the ID on when the engine is

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.709 
I wanted the ID on when the engine is
warm<00:00:32.759> as<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:34.200> see<00:00:34.410> I'm<00:00:34.649> in<00:00:34.800> neutral<00:00:35.570> foot<00:00:36.570> on

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
warm as you see I'm in neutral foot on

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.510 
warm as you see I'm in neutral foot on
brake<00:00:36.989> I'm<00:00:37.800> just<00:00:38.250> racing<00:00:38.489> up<00:00:39.890> okay<00:00:40.890> I'm<00:00:41.190> just

brake I'm just racing up okay I'm just
now<00:00:41.730> on<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.090> unbreak<00:00:42.980> one<00:00:43.980> click<00:00:44.250> more<00:00:44.600> so<00:00:45.600> now

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
now on the unbreak one click more so now

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.470 
now on the unbreak one click more so now
I'm<00:00:46.200> gonna<00:00:46.440> put<00:00:46.559> in<00:00:47.070> D<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.180> look<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.260> idol

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
I'm gonna put in D and look the idol

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.600 
I'm gonna put in D and look the idol
must<00:00:51.480> break<00:00:51.809> from<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:53.989> as<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.829> can<00:00:56.039> see<00:00:56.309> my

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
must break from this as you can see my

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:05.270 
must break from this as you can see my
idol<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.570> very<00:00:58.379> low<00:01:00.890> 558<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:02.129> think<00:01:03.229> and<00:01:04.229> if<00:01:04.860> I

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
idol is very low 558 I think and if I

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.310 
idol is very low 558 I think and if I
and<00:01:05.760> my<00:01:06.750> lights<00:01:06.990> are<00:01:07.200> on<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:07.970> if<00:01:08.970> I<00:01:09.420> just<00:01:09.780> put<00:01:10.080> my

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
and my lights are on so if I just put my

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:21.640 
and my lights are on so if I just put my
fog<00:01:10.950> lights<00:01:11.600> more<00:01:13.760> look<00:01:17.330> 550<00:01:18.330> 25<00:01:19.729> raising<00:01:20.729> them

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
fog lights more look 550 25 raising them

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:30.440 
fog lights more look 550 25 raising them
aya<00:01:23.390> not<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:24.600> much<00:01:24.750> much<00:01:24.990> higher<00:01:29.119> so<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.150> don't

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
aya not so much much higher so I don't

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.200 
aya not so much much higher so I don't
know<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.840> don't<00:01:31.439> know<00:01:31.740> if<00:01:32.009> it's<00:01:32.280> my<00:01:33.259> maybe<00:01:34.259> my

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
know I don't know if it's my maybe my

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:42.520 
know I don't know if it's my maybe my
voltage<00:01:36.210> regulator<00:01:37.130> that<00:01:38.130> who<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:40.579> not<00:01:41.579> fully

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
voltage regulator that who is not fully

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.850 
voltage regulator that who is not fully
giving<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:44.149> amount<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.390> power<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.140> the

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
giving the amount of power that the

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.010 
giving the amount of power that the
engine<00:01:47.280> should<00:01:47.610> need<00:01:48.560> or<00:01:49.560> if<00:01:50.280> my<00:01:51.020> intake

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
engine should need or if my intake

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.700 
engine should need or if my intake
exhaust<00:01:52.560> my<00:01:53.490> intellect<00:01:54.000> camshaft<00:01:54.479> position

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
exhaust my intellect camshaft position

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.399 
exhaust my intellect camshaft position
positions<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.759> defective<00:01:57.180> also<00:01:57.630> that

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
positions and so is defective also that

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.490 
positions and so is defective also that
may<00:01:59.130> be<00:02:00.290> one<00:02:01.290> cause<00:02:01.850> for<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.060> bad<00:02:03.500> idle

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
may be one cause for the bad idle

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.160 
may be one cause for the bad idle
because<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.250> engine<00:02:05.640> maybe<00:02:06.479> needs<00:02:07.039> a<00:02:09.170> good

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
because the engine maybe needs a good

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.490 
because the engine maybe needs a good
sense<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.560> for<00:02:10.860> it

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
sense of for it

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.540 
sense of for it
I<00:02:12.530> don't<00:02:13.220> know<00:02:13.400> what<00:02:13.670> I<00:02:13.700> can<00:02:14.180> do<00:02:14.810> to<00:02:15.489> try<00:02:16.489> the

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
I don't know what I can do to try the

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.990 
I don't know what I can do to try the
rolling<00:02:17.090> up<00:02:17.330> my<00:02:17.360> window<00:02:17.900> which<00:02:18.050> is<00:02:18.080> already<00:02:18.590> up

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.440 

we'll<00:02:23.000> see

let put in D once again the cars Rumble
a<00:03:19.480> bit<00:03:19.900> when<00:03:20.860> on<00:03:21.280> solar<00:03:22.000> tidal<00:03:22.450> if<00:03:23.260> I<00:03:23.530> really

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
a bit when on solar tidal if I really

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.400 
a bit when on solar tidal if I really
think<00:03:24.130> and<00:03:24.370> I'm<00:03:24.610> starting<00:03:25.090> to<00:03:25.269> drive<00:03:25.720> let's

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
think and I'm starting to drive let's

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:35.910 
think and I'm starting to drive let's
say<00:03:32.250> right<00:03:33.250> now<00:03:33.280> the<00:03:33.790> car<00:03:33.820> is<00:03:34.269> moving<00:03:34.900> just<00:03:35.769> a

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
say right now the car is moving just a

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:44.819 
say right now the car is moving just a
bit<00:03:37.739> but<00:03:38.739> for<00:03:39.400> me<00:03:39.579> the<00:03:39.760> idol<00:03:39.910> is<00:03:43.530> when<00:03:44.530> I<00:03:44.560> use

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
bit but for me the idol is when I use

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:49.229 
bit but for me the idol is when I use
the<00:03:45.130> steering<00:03:45.519> comb<00:03:45.940> there<00:03:47.400> as<00:03:48.400> are<00:03:48.730> so<00:03:48.940> ditch

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
the steering comb there as are so ditch

00:03:49.239 --> 00:04:00.660
