00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.880
 So I tell you yet what we are 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.949

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.470

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:32.640

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.739
 First of all, the good thing about it is us 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.360

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.100
 the parking deck and there the light falls 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.410
 just a bit over it, too 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.710
 we have a very nice light here 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:46.040

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.040

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.040
 With 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.720
 We have now taken a few pictures 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:36.590
 the settings are iso 100 aperture 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:37.700

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.799
 still up here on the parking deck 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.510
 we are so close to that now 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.069
 to record video because it seems outside 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.019
 the sun and that is not so 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.430
 ideal 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.840
 yes we have now burn another 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.319
 seen location and do it now 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.060
 images 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.470
 I'll just tell you what we have here 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.859
 Something I actually photograph 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:58.569
 have here the canon eos 6d and the 50 mm 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:03:01.910
 1.4 but you can do that as well 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:04.390
 50 mm 1.8 know the free of charge 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.810
 and at nikon grad times around 100 euro 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:10.190
 and yes with a 500 gb or 500 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.019
 565 no idea no matter which camera 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.909
 you can do it as well 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.049
 do 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:17.150
 and yes, only this is important 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:20.650
 wide open aperture so that he there 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.650
 background gets nice out of focus 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.400
 so people that 's it with this 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.600
 already in the video 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.580
 but I still have a good message 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.320
 for you and there will be one more 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.690
 second part to give 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.370
 which will follow soon when you do that 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.570
 video now looks shortly after it 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.320
 I would have to be released 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.470
 be patient 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.730
 and if you are watching the video and yes it is 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.380

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.000

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.730

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.020
