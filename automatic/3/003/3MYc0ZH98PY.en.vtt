go around to cut off all these rough

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.220 
go around to cut off all these rough
edges<00:00:52.649> here<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.760> would<00:00:54.210> make<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.539> uneven<00:00:54.989> so

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
edges here that would make it uneven so

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.439 
edges here that would make it uneven so
that<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.440> have<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.649> nice<00:00:56.000> even<00:00:57.000> little<00:00:57.239> pig

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.380 
that you have a nice even little pig
nose<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:58.649> that's<00:00:58.829> for<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.129> nose<00:00:59.309> for<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.210> ears

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
nose so that's for the nose for the ears

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.840 
nose so that's for the nose for the ears
I<00:01:00.809> would<00:01:01.140> do<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.379> same<00:01:01.649> thing<00:01:02.070> but<00:01:02.579> then<00:01:02.760> I

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
I would do the same thing but then I

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.109 
I would do the same thing but then I
would<00:01:03.000> cut<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:03.510> half<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.369> cut<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.700> in<00:01:05.820> half

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
would cut it in half and cut it in half

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.890 
would cut it in half and cut it in half
again<00:01:06.500> and<00:01:07.500> then<00:01:08.310> kind<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.640> press<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.240> out<00:01:09.390> flat

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
again and then kind of press it out flat

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.890 
again and then kind of press it out flat

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
pigs face and all you have to do is just

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.300 
pigs face and all you have to do is just
smear<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.360> paint<00:01:39.540> around<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.590> saves<00:01:41.159> you

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
smear the paint around so that saves you

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.490 
smear the paint around so that saves you
a<00:01:41.340> step<00:01:41.430> save<00:01:42.060> some<00:01:42.360> materials<00:01:42.930> it's<00:01:43.259> quite

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
a step save some materials it's quite

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.219 
a step save some materials it's quite
nice<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:44.009> think<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:45.030> paper<00:01:45.270> plate<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.810> just<00:01:46.079> a

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
nice I think the paper plate is just a

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.580 
nice I think the paper plate is just a
little<00:01:46.590> bit<00:01:46.740> too<00:01:47.009> big<00:01:47.310> for<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.700> pigs<00:01:47.970> face<00:01:48.590> but

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
little bit too big for the pigs face but

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.499 
little bit too big for the pigs face but
the<00:01:49.860> nice<00:01:50.040> thing<00:01:50.070> about<00:01:50.340> using<00:01:50.670> paper<00:01:51.060> plates

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
the nice thing about using paper plates

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.219 
the nice thing about using paper plates
is<00:01:51.899> that<00:01:52.229> they<00:01:52.380> have<00:01:52.619> all<00:01:53.280> these<00:01:54.229> circles

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
is that they have all these circles

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.440 
is that they have all these circles
within<00:01:55.649> them<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.610> can<00:01:56.790> use<00:01:56.969> as<00:01:57.149> guides

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
within them that you can use as guides

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.030 
within them that you can use as guides
when<00:01:57.780> you're<00:01:57.899> making<00:01:58.079> these<00:01:58.320> kind<00:01:58.649> of<00:01:58.710> crafts

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
when you're making these kind of crafts

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.819 
when you're making these kind of crafts
out<00:01:59.280> of<00:01:59.430> paper<00:01:59.579> plates<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:00.869> can<00:02:01.380> just<00:02:01.560> cut

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
out of paper plates so you can just cut

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.780 
out of paper plates so you can just cut
along<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.430> line<00:02:02.990> this<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.170> nice<00:02:04.759> thing<00:02:05.759> to

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
along that line this is a nice thing to

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.279 
along that line this is a nice thing to
