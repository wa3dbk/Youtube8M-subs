00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.930
 Hello, today we will open 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:21.830
 parcel a little about, too, again a little bit 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.810
 open if you remember something in the previous one 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.090
 video pavel topics i opened 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.630
 would show my contact which i 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.700
 has gained 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.430
 and now I finally got here 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:34.210
 my pedal vertebrology hastily this 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:37.730
 us pedals pedals pedals 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.329
 785 n 785 last time the seller made a mistake and 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.270
 sent me 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.590
 p780 that is, it was a combined 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:47.050
 trodden pedal boats to 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:51.290
 pedal to contact trampled to 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:54.020
 you can painted everything well everything is correct 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:59.560
 here and now we will look as from it 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:01.930
 It looks because the price and then on something 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.970
 there is left and right 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.409
 admin tits and they crowded a normal 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.380
 already ecstatic pedals that is not 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:12.049
 took no pizza 20 30 40 and so on you 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.170
 ru took itself already xt buckle and I think that 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:20.659
 In principle, there will be no choice between 780 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:23.270
 and 785 before 700 80 85 that 785 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:26.049
 an extra frame like this 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.639
 we have it like trail pedals 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:31.009
 that is, it implies that they were 

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:32.869
 that is, the mechanism will be better protected when 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.380
 driving over rough terrain there 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:38.789
 from everyone there 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.350
 and I donâ€™t know there is grass there and there 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:42.360
 trees of hummocks and so on that is 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.350
 we will have this mechanism here 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.329
 well, plus how it gives us how it was 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.759
 written at least that is a big 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:56.549
 shoe contact with the pedal itself 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.530
 here what is our adjustment i'm so 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:02.399
 I understand stiffness 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.170
 pedals pedals shoes from this 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.659
 contact that is can be adjusted and 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.910
 put that is well what's cool that 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.319
 sided since it does not 780 and 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.560
 because looked it can be left 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.750
 and 780 okay, they are almost in price 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.370
 It is worth it, but not as a principle 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.810
 advised when something better because 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.180
 what is there to u need to turn over 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.830
 look for a side which action what with 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.459
 this article buttoned that with this 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:30.900
 buttoned up and drove the difference between 700 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:33.120
 80 85 is that also in the framework yes well 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.400
 weight ie the pedals weigh on second 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:41.280
 a gram more i.e. their weight is 408 grams 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:45.299
 that pair was 300 345 in my opinion he even 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.850
 63 grams but it's terribly mega critical here 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.329
 I honestly I do not know how else it will be 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.280
 to look like 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.019
 still most likely that the video will be 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.389
 how will I put it all how will it be 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:58.510
 look and accordingly my mine 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:03:03.040
 tries movement on 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:05.990
 nananana than on these pedal as 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:19.540
 my mastering is this a mechanism 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:19.540
 now i want shoes we have instruction 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.270
 if if harry struction i am but on 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.490
 contacts themselves 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:30.080
 that is, we screw it up 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:36.590
 we understand shoes and then just here 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:38.270
 so it snaps out so here's the counter in 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.660
 In general, I still do not know how yet 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.630
 we will check it all very much 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.990
 test now i will try again 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:53.120
 imagine 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:57.290
 shoes but there our shoes are yes that is 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:01.580
 contact with us so so here so somehow 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:04.730
 he should cling so i understand 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:08.030
 it's all business and so here we have to 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.780
 pedal unless of course that well i don't 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:15.950
 I understand why why a large surface 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:18.820
 contact signed in the description with that is 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:21.440
 with shoes because 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.470
 but well as the frame goes, that is, it is not 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.350
 here is not here she is out of touch then 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:31.490
 we also have a pretty sole 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:36.110
 rigidly and generally we will assume everything 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:38.440
 additional protection 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.969
 here we are today unpacking small 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.819
 spa theme bike 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:45.559
 Now I know that some signed 

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:46.610
 metal only solely because 

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:48.979
 Lesya on my channel 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.049
 and bicycle chips stuff and so on 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:53.209
 Now I think that this video will be 

00:04:51.049 --> 00:04:54.860
 I wonder if no one is interested either 

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:57.999
 This video will be interesting not only for 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:02.059
 these people also or people who 

00:04:57.999 --> 00:05:05.029
 plan to buy it all loops even so 

00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:06.979
 want to do something more serious 

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:10.159
 movement on a bicycle that is not easy 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:13.219
 so in city mode but also travel 

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:16.249
 where anything any more pokatushki 

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:19.789
 actually more interesting to here such here at 

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:20.449
 today unpacking the pedals deore xt 785 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:22.489
 this year 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:24.499

 that it was interesting for you and 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:28.449
 useful 

00:05:26.329 --> 00:05:31.069
 link where I bought I put under the video but 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:33.319
 but it will be possible to buy on only 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:35.299
 those who live in Ukraine here but in extreme 

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:36.860
 least that is, and the boss also link 

00:05:35.299 --> 00:05:39.289
 I can put the chiefs can see 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.879
 they wonder how many do not stand and then 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:42.349
 Thank you all for your attention before and 

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:44.329
 what video did you like from so then 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:45.919
 like to subscribe to the button 

00:05:44.329 --> 00:05:49.129
 not signed write comments ask 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:50.779
 Questions in general, as if it were, if anyone 

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:52.849
 He uses the contact and also write 

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:55.519
 maybe some interesting experience will tell 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:57.439
 or bucks any nuances here I would like 

00:05:55.519 --> 00:05:59.839
 also know because with contacts so far 

00:05:57.439 --> 00:06:01.969
 what I'm just starting on contacts will 

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:04.789
 start more precisely not to go to the contacts and 

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:07.099
 there is more likely everything will be exactly 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:09.909
 get out then all thanks 

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:09.909
