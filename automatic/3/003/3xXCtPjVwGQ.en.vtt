00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 
top now these color mists are kind of

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.040 
top now these color mists are kind of
like<00:00:33.160> a<00:00:33.190> mini<00:00:33.520> airbrush<00:00:34.180> system<00:00:34.540> which<00:00:34.900> is

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
like a mini airbrush system which is

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:35.850 
like a mini airbrush system which is
really<00:00:35.290> awesome

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
really awesome

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.810 
really awesome
but<00:00:36.190> they<00:00:36.280> only<00:00:36.430> have<00:00:36.699> one<00:00:37.150> nozzle<00:00:37.680> strength

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
but they only have one nozzle strength

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.299 
but they only have one nozzle strength
so<00:00:39.820> if<00:00:40.210> you<00:00:40.420> want<00:00:40.629> to<00:00:40.690> take<00:00:41.020> a<00:00:41.350> paper<00:00:41.920> towel

so if you want to take a paper towel

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:47.189 
so if you want to take a paper towel
first<00:00:42.699> and<00:00:44.040> just<00:00:45.040> practice<00:00:45.400> and<00:00:45.940> see<00:00:46.540> you<00:00:47.080> know

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199 
first and just practice and see you know

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:49.439 
first and just practice and see you know
what<00:00:47.470> result<00:00:47.890> you<00:00:48.040> get<00:00:48.280> the<00:00:48.790> closer<00:00:49.120> you<00:00:49.420> are

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
what result you get the closer you are

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.270 
what result you get the closer you are
the<00:00:49.659> darker<00:00:50.290> it<00:00:50.350> is<00:00:50.440> the<00:00:50.680> farther<00:00:50.979> away<00:00:51.129> you

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
the darker it is the farther away you

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.219 
the darker it is the farther away you
are<00:00:51.460> the<00:00:51.820> lighter<00:00:52.030> it's<00:00:52.269> going<00:00:52.449> to<00:00:52.510> be<00:00:52.690> but

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:53.229 
are the lighter it's going to be but

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:57.210 
are the lighter it's going to be but
also<00:00:53.440> the<00:00:53.739> closer<00:00:53.979> you<00:00:54.280> are<00:00:54.309> the<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:56.680> more<00:00:56.949> the

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
also the closer you are the the more the

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.700 
also the closer you are the the more the
the<00:00:57.370> thicker<00:00:57.909> or<00:00:58.269> the<00:00:58.510> smaller<00:00:59.199> the<00:00:59.440> stripe

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
the thicker or the smaller the stripe

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.009 
the thicker or the smaller the stripe
there<00:00:59.949> we<00:01:00.040> go<00:01:00.159> the<00:01:00.550> farther<00:01:00.850> away<00:01:01.269> you<00:01:01.449> are<00:01:01.629> the

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:02.019 
there we go the farther away you are the

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:04.619 
there we go the farther away you are the
just<00:01:02.890> more<00:01:03.190> broadcast<00:01:03.820> it<00:01:04.089> will<00:01:04.239> be<00:01:04.390> so<00:01:04.600> you

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
just more broadcast it will be so you

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.180
