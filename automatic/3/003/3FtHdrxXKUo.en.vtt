00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:21.769 
glitch on halo reach but i also have a

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:24.529 
glitch on halo reach but i also have a
saw<00:00:22.769> it's<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.279> new<00:00:23.400> type<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.670> glitch<00:00:24.000> altogether

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
saw it's a new type of glitch altogether

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.929 
saw it's a new type of glitch altogether
i<00:00:24.660> think<00:00:24.960> it's<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.199> actually<00:00:26.160> positive<00:00:26.730> it's<00:00:26.820> at

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
i think it's a actually positive it's at

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.750 
i think it's a actually positive it's at
first<00:00:27.680> it's<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.740> barrier<00:00:29.220> glitch<00:00:29.519> on

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
first it's a barrier glitch on

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.299 
first it's a barrier glitch on
waterfront<00:00:30.679> i'm<00:00:31.679> going<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:31.920> do<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.070> multiply

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
waterfront i'm going to do is multiply

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.190 
waterfront i'm going to do is multiply
as<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.969> video<00:00:33.270> so<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.600> didn't<00:00:33.840> catch<00:00:34.020> what

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
as to the video so you didn't catch what

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.370 
as to the video so you didn't catch what
i<00:00:34.230> just<00:00:34.320> did<00:00:34.590> go<00:00:34.829> back<00:00:35.420> basically<00:00:36.420> go<00:00:37.079> up<00:00:37.230> on

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
i just did go back basically go up on

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.470 
i just did go back basically go up on
any<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.950> fuel<00:00:38.280> things<00:00:38.579> on<00:00:38.879> water<00:00:39.239> fun<00:00:39.450> i

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
any of the fuel things on water fun i

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.270 
any of the fuel things on water fun i
guess<00:00:39.540> they're<00:00:39.809> like<00:00:39.930> oil<00:00:40.410> rigs<00:00:40.710> or<00:00:40.950> something

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
guess they're like oil rigs or something

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.310 
guess they're like oil rigs or something
you<00:00:42.059> want<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.210> go<00:00:42.329> on<00:00:42.450> top<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.719> them<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.170> then

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
you want to go on top of them and then

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.920 
you want to go on top of them and then
move<00:00:43.500> slowly<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.399> right<00:00:44.850> or<00:00:45.300> left<00:00:45.329> and

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
move slowly to the right or left and

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.990 
move slowly to the right or left and
eventually<00:00:46.379> you'll<00:00:46.829> be<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.309> little<00:00:47.579> barrier

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
eventually you'll be in a little barrier

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.720 
eventually you'll be in a little barrier
area<00:00:48.329> where<00:00:49.320> like<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:49.980> doesn't<00:00:50.280> count<00:00:50.430> down

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
area where like it doesn't count down

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.310 
area where like it doesn't count down
like<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.120> am<00:00:51.239> right<00:00:51.270> now<00:00:51.510> but<00:00:51.690> at<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.780> very<00:00:51.840> thin

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
like I am right now but at the very thin

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.779 
like I am right now but at the very thin
barrier<00:00:52.500> if<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.800> can<00:00:52.949> see<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.190> little<00:00:53.489> ledge

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
barrier if you can see that little ledge

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.939 
barrier if you can see that little ledge
there's<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.570> bigger<00:00:54.780> legend<00:00:55.199> as<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.350> small<00:00:55.649> next

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
there's a bigger legend as a small next

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.260 
there's a bigger legend as a small next
to<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.190> have<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.399> be<00:00:56.489> kind<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.789> over<00:00:57.059> that

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
to it you have to be kind of over that

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.779 
to it you have to be kind of over that
but<00:00:58.230> more<00:00:58.379> importantly<00:00:58.920> look<00:00:59.160> at<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.399> hunters

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
but more importantly look at the hunters

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.130 
but more importantly look at the hunters
see<00:01:00.149> how<00:01:00.270> they're<00:01:00.420> just<00:01:00.570> kind<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.780> standing

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
see how they're just kind of standing

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.170 
see how they're just kind of standing

they charge it up in this stop like they

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.520 
they charge it up in this stop like they
never<00:01:13.420> shoot<00:01:13.810> they'll<00:01:13.990> go<00:01:14.110> after<00:01:14.230> your

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
ever it's a full-blown barrier glitch

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.020 
ever it's a full-blown barrier glitch
they<00:01:19.420> can't<00:01:19.660> shoot<00:01:19.960> you<00:01:20.370> I<00:01:21.370> should<00:01:21.730> bring<00:01:21.910> this

they can't shoot you I should bring this
up<00:01:22.210> we<00:01:22.390> actually<00:01:22.900> did<00:01:23.110> not<00:01:23.140> try<00:01:23.620> this<00:01:23.680> with

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
up we actually did not try this with

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.980 
up we actually did not try this with
anything<00:01:24.340> but<00:01:24.550> hunters<00:01:25.060> we<00:01:25.300> had<00:01:25.570> it<00:01:25.690> set<00:01:25.960> to

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
anything but hunters we had it set to

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.480 
anything but hunters we had it set to
all<00:01:26.200> hunters<00:01:26.650> because<00:01:26.920> when<00:01:27.070> we're<00:01:27.190> looking

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
all hunters because when we're looking

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.670 
all hunters because when we're looking
for<00:01:27.670> glitches<00:01:27.880> we<00:01:28.870> think<00:01:29.140> it's<00:01:29.230> really<00:01:29.500> easy

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
for glitches we think it's really easy

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.950 
for glitches we think it's really easy
to<00:01:29.920> use<00:01:29.950> hunters<00:01:30.550> because<00:01:31.000> they're<00:01:31.300> really

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
to use hunters because they're really

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.660 
to use hunters because they're really
stupid<00:01:32.470> and<00:01:32.650> firefight<00:01:33.070> I<00:01:33.220> don't<00:01:33.430> know<00:01:33.520> why

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
stupid and firefight I don't know why

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.590 
stupid and firefight I don't know why
there's<00:01:33.940> really<00:01:34.330> stupid<00:01:34.750> but<00:01:35.530> you<00:01:35.710> know<00:01:36.600> the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
there's really stupid but you know the

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.090 
there's really stupid but you know the
one<00:01:37.840> that<00:01:37.960> I'm<00:01:38.140> on<00:01:38.320> is<00:01:38.470> the<00:01:38.560> one<00:01:38.710> I<00:01:38.740> guess<00:01:38.980> if

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
one that I'm on is the one I guess if

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.560 
one that I'm on is the one I guess if
you're<00:01:39.220> looking<00:01:39.550> into<00:01:39.790> the<00:01:40.090> island<00:01:40.390> from<00:01:40.510> the

like the platforms on the far left is

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.250

and he decided her because this is a new
type<00:02:56.980> of<00:02:57.010> glitch<00:02:57.310> what<00:02:57.460> we're<00:02:57.580> going<00:02:57.670> to<00:02:57.760> call

was<00:03:50.160> looking<00:03:50.220> for<00:03:50.490> more<00:03:50.610> glitches<00:03:50.850> I'm<00:03:51.300> still

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
was looking for more glitches I'm still

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.930 
was looking for more glitches I'm still
up<00:03:51.780> here<00:03:51.810> and<00:03:52.260> now<00:03:52.980> still<00:03:53.430> if<00:03:53.550> you<00:03:53.700> don't

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
believe me that they haven't done it at

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.710 
believe me that they haven't done it at
this<00:03:56.370> point<00:03:56.610> I<00:03:56.730> think<00:03:56.790> don't<00:03:57.270> you<00:03:57.360> think<00:03:57.450> they

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
this point I think don't you think they

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.699 
this point I think don't you think they
might<00:03:57.900> have<00:03:57.930> shot<00:03:58.200> at<00:03:58.350> me<00:03:58.470> at<00:03:58.590> least<00:03:58.740> once<00:04:00.709> we

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
might have shot at me at least once we

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.140 
might have shot at me at least once we
haven't<00:04:02.010> been<00:04:02.070> able<00:04:02.130> to<00:04:02.340> like<00:04:02.459> messes<00:04:02.850> up<00:04:03.030> Lee

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
haven't been able to like messes up Lee

cuz the laser and stop or they'll just

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.930 
cuz the laser and stop or they'll just
do<00:04:14.730> like<00:04:15.049> like<00:04:16.049> nothing<00:04:16.470> basically<00:04:16.859> now<00:04:17.700> here

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
do like like nothing basically now here

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.759 
do like like nothing basically now here
we<00:04:18.030> go<00:04:18.060> see<00:04:18.450> if<00:04:18.510> they<00:04:18.720> get<00:04:18.989> back<00:04:19.019> up<00:04:19.350> there<00:04:19.560> and

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
we go see if they get back up there and

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.259 
we go see if they get back up there and
thank<00:04:20.130> you<00:04:20.220> move<00:04:20.340> it<00:04:20.459> slowly<00:04:20.640> slowly<00:04:20.970> slowly

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
thank you move it slowly slowly slowly

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.409 
thank you move it slowly slowly slowly
slowly<00:04:22.610> eventually<00:04:23.610> we<00:04:23.730> will<00:04:23.820> land<00:04:24.060> over<00:04:24.360> on

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
slowly eventually we will land over on

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:25.640 
slowly eventually we will land over on
the<00:04:24.510> ledge<00:04:24.690> don't<00:04:24.900> think<00:04:25.050> he<00:04:25.140> makes<00:04:25.320> it<00:04:25.500> here

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
the ledge don't think he makes it here

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.530 
the ledge don't think he makes it here
though<00:04:27.440> but<00:04:28.440> um<00:04:28.910> kind<00:04:29.910> of<00:04:29.970> move<00:04:30.090> slowly<00:04:30.300> but

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
though but um kind of move slowly but

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.150 
though but um kind of move slowly but
don't<00:04:30.660> move<00:04:30.780> that<00:04:30.810> slowly<00:04:31.320> and<00:04:31.590> you<00:04:31.890> only<00:04:31.980> got

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
don't move that slowly and you only got

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.860 
don't move that slowly and you only got
really<00:04:32.400> one<00:04:32.610> shot<00:04:32.910> it's<00:04:33.120> not<00:04:33.240> like<00:04:33.390> even<00:04:33.480> fall

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
really one shot it's not like even fall

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.430 
really one shot it's not like even fall
down<00:04:34.110> because<00:04:34.320> the<00:04:34.620> timer<00:04:34.919> does<00:04:35.870> stay<00:04:36.870> as<00:04:37.200> it

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
down because the timer does stay as it

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.790 
down because the timer does stay as it
it<00:04:37.980> doesn't<00:04:38.310> reset<00:04:38.700> I<00:04:38.850> guess<00:04:39.000> I<00:04:39.090> should<00:04:39.270> say

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
it doesn't reset I guess I should say

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.620 
it doesn't reset I guess I should say
but<00:04:40.800> they<00:04:40.919> are<00:04:41.070> there<00:04:41.160> you<00:04:41.400> just<00:04:41.520> got<00:04:41.730> it<00:04:41.910> now
