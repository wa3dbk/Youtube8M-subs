00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
started to visualized I started to train

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.180 
started to visualized I started to train
my<00:03:10.010> my<00:03:10.519> brain<00:03:10.820> and<00:03:11.600> what<00:03:12.260> is<00:03:12.380> visualization

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
my my brain and what is visualization

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.319 
my my brain and what is visualization
it's<00:03:13.810> when<00:03:14.810> you<00:03:15.019> make<00:03:15.049> your<00:03:15.769> brain<00:03:16.329> believe

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
it's when you make your brain believe

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:20.650 
it's when you make your brain believe
that<00:03:17.660> a<00:03:17.900> specific<00:03:18.709> task<00:03:19.120> already<00:03:20.120> happened

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
that a specific task already happened

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.599 
that a specific task already happened
you<00:03:21.760> think<00:03:22.760> of<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.350> special<00:03:24.350> event<00:03:24.680> over<00:03:25.340> and

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609 
you think of the special event over and

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.840 
you think of the special event over and
over<00:03:26.030> again<00:03:26.180> you<00:03:26.930> am<00:03:27.109> i<00:03:27.380> what<00:03:27.890> I<00:03:27.920> did<00:03:28.190> that<00:03:28.519> I<00:03:28.640> I

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
over again you am i what I did that I I

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.120 
over again you am i what I did that I I
imagined<00:03:29.540> the<00:03:29.660> whole<00:03:29.690> dive<00:03:30.170> again<00:03:30.590> and<00:03:30.890> again

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
imagined the whole dive again and again

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.720 
imagined the whole dive again and again
and<00:03:31.370> I<00:03:31.790> included<00:03:32.480> all<00:03:32.690> the<00:03:33.620> details<00:03:34.100> into<00:03:34.609> my

and I included all the details into my

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.759 
and I included all the details into my
dive<00:03:35.030> I<00:03:37.480> calculated<00:03:38.480> and<00:03:38.780> visualized

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
dive I calculated and visualized

a three minutes dive can take me hours
to<00:04:52.389> visualize<00:04:52.990> because<00:04:53.229> I<00:04:54.389> visualize

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
to visualize because I visualize

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:58.020 
to visualize because I visualize
absolutely<00:04:56.020> everything<00:04:56.530> but<00:04:57.340> just<00:04:57.520> before<00:04:57.759> my

absolutely everything but just before my
dive<00:04:58.270> I<00:04:58.949> visualize<00:04:59.949> the<00:05:00.669> whole<00:05:00.910> episode<00:05:01.389> in

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
dive I visualize the whole episode in

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.950 
dive I visualize the whole episode in
just<00:05:01.780> few<00:05:02.050> seconds<00:05:02.940> so<00:05:03.940> a<00:05:03.970> visualization<00:05:04.900> that

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
just few seconds so a visualization that

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.399 
just few seconds so a visualization that
could<00:05:05.169> take<00:05:05.349> hours<00:05:06.449> can<00:05:07.449> suddenly<00:05:07.960> take<00:05:08.139> three

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:08.409 
could take hours can suddenly take three

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:10.620 
could take hours can suddenly take three
seconds<00:05:09.070> or<00:05:09.159> four<00:05:09.340> seconds<00:05:09.699> because<00:05:09.849> I<00:05:10.120> what<00:05:10.599> I

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
seconds or four seconds because I what I

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.740 
seconds or four seconds because I what I
do<00:05:10.750> is<00:05:11.110> I<00:05:11.289> first<00:05:11.620> think<00:05:11.979> the<00:05:12.130> whole<00:05:12.370> episode

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
do is I first think the whole episode

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.670 
do is I first think the whole episode
just<00:05:13.750> right<00:05:14.169> before<00:05:14.380> my<00:05:14.650> dive<00:05:15.720> and<00:05:16.720> what<00:05:17.650> I

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
just right before my dive and what I

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.830 
just right before my dive and what I
what<00:05:18.580> I<00:05:18.610> do<00:05:18.760> also<00:05:19.150> is<00:05:19.570> I<00:05:20.289> break<00:05:20.800> down<00:05:20.830> the<00:05:21.130> task

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
what I do also is I break down the task

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.070 
what I do also is I break down the task
the<00:05:22.840> dive<00:05:23.099> into<00:05:24.099> small<00:05:24.610> steps<00:05:25.030> and<00:05:25.449> I

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
the dive into small steps and I

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.010 
the dive into small steps and I
brainstorm<00:05:26.800> the<00:05:27.430> whole<00:05:27.639> the<00:05:27.849> whole<00:05:28.510> thing<00:05:28.539> and

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
brainstorm the whole the whole thing and

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.180 
brainstorm the whole the whole thing and
then<00:05:29.139> I<00:05:29.229> will<00:05:29.470> I<00:05:30.010> will<00:05:30.400> reload<00:05:30.880> it<00:05:31.060> to<00:05:31.180> my<00:05:31.300> brain

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
then I will I will reload it to my brain

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.750 
then I will I will reload it to my brain
so<00:05:33.190> it's<00:05:33.370> there

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.719 

after<00:05:36.760> the<00:05:36.909> visualization<00:05:37.780> I<00:05:37.930> started<00:05:38.380> to

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:38.729 
after the visualization I started to

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:41.460 
after the visualization I started to
start<00:05:39.729> it<00:05:39.820> with<00:05:39.849> the<00:05:40.330> physical<00:05:40.780> training<00:05:41.349> and

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
start it with the physical training and

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:46.770 
start it with the physical training and
I<00:05:41.919> keep<00:05:42.280> listening<00:05:43.270> to<00:05:43.630> my<00:05:43.780> body<00:05:43.990> I<00:05:45.300> kept<00:05:46.300> the

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
I keep listening to my body I kept the

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.210 
I keep listening to my body I kept the
clear<00:05:47.229> mind<00:05:47.620> and<00:05:48.090> pure<00:05:49.090> mind<00:05:49.590> because<00:05:50.590> it's

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
clear mind and pure mind because it's

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.370 
clear mind and pure mind because it's
very<00:05:51.520> essential<00:05:52.030> that<00:05:52.510> you<00:05:52.659> have<00:05:52.840> the<00:05:53.169> good

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380 
very essential that you have the good

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.460 
very essential that you have the good
vibes

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:59.010 

the<00:05:56.980> visualization<00:05:57.910> is<00:05:58.060> very<00:05:58.090> vital<00:05:58.810> for<00:05:58.840> a

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
the visualization is very vital for a

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.140 
the visualization is very vital for a
free<00:05:59.260> diver<00:05:59.500> because<00:06:00.250> it<00:06:00.430> can<00:06:00.610> take<00:06:00.820> a<00:06:00.880> free

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
free diver because it can take a free

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.210 
free diver because it can take a free
diver<00:06:01.330> deeper<00:06:01.930> and<00:06:02.200> cascade<00:06:02.770> to<00:06:02.860> get<00:06:02.980> free

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:03.220 
diver deeper and cascade to get free

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.840 
diver deeper and cascade to get free
diver<00:06:03.430> longer<00:06:04.290> and<00:06:05.290> it's<00:06:05.800> also<00:06:06.040> important

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:06.850 
diver longer and it's also important

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:13.380 
diver longer and it's also important
that<00:06:07.590> you<00:06:09.270> that<00:06:10.270> you<00:06:10.450> keep<00:06:11.730> relaxing<00:06:12.730> while
