years<00:01:21.220> work<00:01:21.430> and<00:01:22.270> it's<00:01:22.870> very<00:01:22.930> much<00:01:23.170> tied<00:01:23.530> into

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
years work and it's very much tied into

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.500 
years work and it's very much tied into
things<00:01:24.130> that<00:01:24.310> I've<00:01:24.430> done<00:01:24.580> in<00:01:24.640> my<00:01:24.729> life<00:01:24.850> for<00:01:25.150> 17

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
things that I've done in my life for 17

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:26.490 
things that I've done in my life for 17
years<00:01:25.720> so<00:01:25.870> it<00:01:25.930> brought<00:01:26.080> back<00:01:26.110> a<00:01:26.290> lot<00:01:26.380> of

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
years so it brought back a lot of

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.289 
years so it brought back a lot of
memories<00:01:26.860> because<00:01:27.280> when<00:01:27.579> you<00:01:27.670> started<00:01:28.149> you

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:28.299 
memories because when you started you

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:29.999 
memories because when you started you
were<00:01:28.479> not<00:01:29.079> in<00:01:29.229> the<00:01:29.320> same<00:01:29.469> place<00:01:29.740> you<00:01:29.890> were

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
were not in the same place you were

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.069 
were not in the same place you were
never<00:01:30.250> by<00:01:30.490> any<00:01:30.520> means<00:01:30.939> you<00:01:31.329> know<00:01:31.450> life<00:01:31.689> has<00:01:31.930> its

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:32.079 
never by any means you know life has its

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:32.850 
never by any means you know life has its
ups<00:01:32.200> and<00:01:32.439> downs

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
ups and downs

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.219 
ups and downs
so<00:01:33.070> how<00:01:33.909> he's<00:01:34.030> been<00:01:34.180> with<00:01:34.360> me<00:01:34.479> through<00:01:34.659> a<00:01:34.750> lot<00:01:34.960> I

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
so how he's been with me through a lot I

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:36.840 
so how he's been with me through a lot I
think<00:01:35.469> it<00:01:35.560> was<00:01:35.649> that<00:01:35.770> feeling<00:01:36.009> more<00:01:36.460> than<00:01:36.520> any

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
think it was that feeling more than any

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.700 
think it was that feeling more than any
other<00:01:37.000> that<00:01:37.270> I<00:01:37.299> wouldn't<00:01:37.659> have<00:01:37.780> that<00:01:37.930> world<00:01:38.170> to

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
other that I wouldn't have that world to

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.069 
other that I wouldn't have that world to
retreat<00:01:39.070> him<00:01:39.280> to<00:01:39.399> again<00:01:39.640> that<00:01:39.880> was<00:01:40.060> painful<00:01:40.329> do

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 
retreat him to again that was painful do

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:42.749 
retreat him to again that was painful do
you<00:01:41.140> feel<00:01:41.380> like<00:01:41.590> you've<00:01:41.799> had<00:01:42.159> to<00:01:42.310> say<00:01:42.490> goodbye

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
you feel like you've had to say goodbye

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:46.499 
you feel like you've had to say goodbye

you um I understand he mapped out your
vision<00:02:17.620> of<00:02:17.800> the<00:02:17.860> books<00:02:18.190> years<00:02:18.520> ago<00:02:18.760> how<00:02:19.180> far

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
vision of the books years ago how far

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.350 
vision of the books years ago how far
was<00:02:19.750> book<00:02:19.960> seven<00:02:20.290> from<00:02:20.440> that<00:02:20.560> original<00:02:20.980> idea

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
was book seven from that original idea

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.240 
was book seven from that original idea
it's<00:02:22.360> really<00:02:22.480> close<00:02:23.290> particularly<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.100> last

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
it's really close particularly the last

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.440 
it's really close particularly the last
third<00:02:24.580> of<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.790> book<00:02:25.110> is

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
third of the book is

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.850 
third of the book is
because<00:02:28.450> as<00:02:28.600> I<00:02:28.750> always<00:02:28.930> planned<00:02:29.290> it<00:02:29.500> it<00:02:29.680> really

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
because as I always planned it it really

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.340 
because as I always planned it it really
is<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:31.090> only<00:02:31.300> exception<00:02:31.720> would<00:02:31.840> be<00:02:31.900> that<00:02:32.170> one

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
is the only exception would be that one

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.830 
is the only exception would be that one
character<00:02:32.890> appears<00:02:33.460> in<00:02:33.790> that<00:02:33.940> last<00:02:34.240> third<00:02:34.510> and

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
character appears in that last third and

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.910 
character appears in that last third and
I<00:02:34.900> thought<00:02:35.050> that<00:02:35.230> character<00:02:35.590> was<00:02:35.710> going<00:02:35.830> to

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
I thought that character was going to

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.400 
I thought that character was going to
die<00:02:36.070> but<00:02:36.280> fine<00:02:36.550> when<00:02:36.880> I<00:02:36.910> started<00:02:37.330> writing<00:02:37.510> so

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
die but fine when I started writing so

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.100 
die but fine when I started writing so
someone<00:02:40.530> mr.<00:02:41.530> Weasley<00:02:42.600> he<00:02:43.600> was<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:43.810> person

form quests they take the form of good

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.040 
form quests they take the form of good
versus<00:05:57.520> evil<00:05:57.640> and<00:05:57.970> what<00:05:58.030> that<00:05:58.210> does<00:05:58.420> to<00:05:58.600> people

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
versus evil and what that does to people

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.830 
versus evil and what that does to people
is<00:05:59.530> Harry<00:05:59.800> Potter<00:06:00.220> based<00:06:01.060> on<00:06:01.360> it<00:06:01.480> anyone<00:06:01.810> that

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 
is Harry Potter based on it anyone that

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.060 
is Harry Potter based on it anyone that
you<00:06:02.080> know<00:06:02.230> no<00:06:02.650> Harry<00:06:02.920> is<00:06:03.070> entirely<00:06:03.520> imaginary

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.070 
you know no Harry is entirely imaginary

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.320 
you know no Harry is entirely imaginary
so<00:06:06.070> I<00:06:06.100> suppose<00:06:06.370> that<00:06:06.520> must<00:06:06.640> be<00:06:06.820> he<00:06:06.940> comes<00:06:07.180> from

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
so I suppose that must be he comes from

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.480 
so I suppose that must be he comes from
me<00:06:07.510> a<00:06:07.540> bit<00:06:07.810> as<00:06:07.990> well<00:06:08.200> once<00:06:08.740> you<00:06:08.920> is<00:06:09.190> the<00:06:09.310> most
