00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 you want to learn how to make this box so 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.629
 cool because I teach you in three singles 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.629
 Steps 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:18.970
 the materials we need for today 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:21.550
 Sponge gloves are a size box 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:25.150
 the way we want a 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.160
 container with water paint brushes 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:31.520
 white to print and two colors that 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:33.200
 we like it and optionally varnish 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.060
 once we have our box 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.620
 selected to paint what we will do 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:40.210
 You will not put gloves 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.210
 To stain our hands excessively 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.210
 and now we are ready to start 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:50.830
 we will take a container and we will throw 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.830
 our white paint to print 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.720
 If the paint is very thick always 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.720
 You can lower it with some water 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.960
 once we have our box 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.730
 completely print and dry we are going to 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.980
 proceed to give it the color layer that 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.750
 we have chosen in my case 1 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.130
 turquoise but remember that you can 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.130
 give the color that you like 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.840
 to paint this color layer does not 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.640
 we need to be excessively 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.640
 careful and then we'll see why 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.940
 once we have our box 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.860
 completely painted we will leave it 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.860
 stand until it dries completely 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.300
 our box is already dry so now 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.510
 the fun begins 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.530
 let's take our sponge a brush 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.530
 and the black paint 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.290
 with the help of the brush we are going to extend 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.010
 some paint to a surface 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.010
 we can stain 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.140
 now we will lower the sponge 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.060
 we will remove the excess paint and 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.690
 we will begin to give light blows in 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.690
 our box 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.300
 and this is our result only 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.460
 you have to finish the box with the same 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.020
 technical and ready you'll have a box 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.320
 super cool to save what you most 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.320
 like 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.350
 as you see it is very simple and fun 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.120
 decorate this type of boxes and if you want 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.710
