00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.649
 the main methods of working with a knife which 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.510
 used in our school 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:12.019
 it means work trainee trail now 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.429
 It means constructed as follows 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:18.900
 pay attention to the position of the hand 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:21.689
 will start a hand but inserted a ring 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.050
 forward where the cutting part itself 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:30.320
 Knife turned to the enemy showed 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:35.930
 fighting stance hit bottom from above 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:38.700
 backlash and kick 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:43.559
 directly go combined 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.219
 character experience shows that when we 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.950
 we put 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.219
 accented blow in this case 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:54.379
 finger position all fingers grab 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.730
 pen if I spend blows to 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:00.239
 tangent directly into 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.789
 moving then i can keep the knife here in 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.309
 such a position and accented 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:09.439
 strikes easier to put a block and hold 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:13.710
 reception is there and the wife must enter 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:17.430
 real contact then due to the movement 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:21.540
 and punches stabbing various 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:24.710
 kind of punches I don't wear cuts to the opponent 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.710
 during which blood loss a person 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.119
 dying if I spend 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.220
 accented punch and polish versions 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.100
 will put the block and directly 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.960
 hold against me reception turned over 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:42.570
 hit rice and always wood us us 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.189
 habits pulls out a knife and do an emphasis 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.860
 there will be calluses will be sore hands 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.610
 you will be felt 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.830
 fish and now take 100 and win 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.600
 knives at least don't give a damn about wood 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.600
 you can stick someone feeling jammed 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.769
 International Center for Russian hand-to-hand 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.860
 combat Russian style produces a set of 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.209
 survival school group 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.640
 safety and also conducts training

 center Russian style 2 Vadim Anatolevich 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.080
 but 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.790
 section learning system throwing knives for 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.980
 points in this section 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.959
 used specially prepared 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.379
 two square meter stand 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:48.560
 full of bar to first 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:51.319
 pores didn't have too much desire 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.470
 get the subject and to ensure that 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.269
 when throwing the subject is constantly hit 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.609
 when throwing a subject 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.829
 used several claws straight 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:04.370
 grip when a knife or for. 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:09.140
 holding the blade pointing forward 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:13.630
 the thumb lies in the direction of the target 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:16.459
 lower slightly cover with a grip dowry 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:21.190
 1 distance that exists 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:24.919
 distance two or three step tasks while 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:27.980
 throw a knife to sharpen this item 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:31.130
 did not turn around and building slightly 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:36.099
 reach out and so he went in with this 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:38.930
 try to lose weight and to be 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:41.419
 perpendicular this distance is 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.540
 most guaranteed by 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:48.049
 which can hit the enemy 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:51.190
 a distance of five six steps when the knife is behind 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:53.950
 . the subject is already holding 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:57.440
 reverse blade grip directed to itself 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:02.209
 at the same time we determined the center of mass of the center 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:05.060
 gravity from balancing the subject big 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.930
 Finger direction towards the bottom slightly 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.480
 cover up 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.090
 the most important task in the early stages 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.459
 learning not to make money with a brush if 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.549
 We will earn money with a brush but what for. 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:18.479
 will be the ear of the task 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:22.650
 which one 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:26.919
 throw from the head because of the ear 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:29.740
 straighten hand slightly stretch slightly 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:33.009
 do not tear and slightly let go of your fingers and 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:36.250
 the task is such that the knife object 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:38.860
 flew and flew for a while right not 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:42.750
 rotated after that he starts doing 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:46.419
 turns and to be perpendicular 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:53.940
 It starts with the fact that you are your step from 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:53.940
 stand back four steps 1 2 3 4 and 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:05:02.940
 we spend the class for what it is on 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:02.940
 look
