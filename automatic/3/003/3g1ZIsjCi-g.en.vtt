Portal originally I had made Gladys from

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.310 
Portal originally I had made Gladys from
Portal<00:00:32.489> based<00:00:33.239> on<00:00:33.420> this<00:00:33.510> ones<00:00:33.750> video<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.290> I

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
Portal based on this ones video that I

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:53.869 
Portal based on this ones video that I
saw<00:00:47.480> and<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.039> made<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:52.100> change<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.190> lose

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
saw and so I made the change to lose

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.770 
saw and so I made the change to lose
every<00:00:54.149> block<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:55.020> then<00:00:56.059> my<00:00:57.059> computer<00:00:57.329> got

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
every block and then my computer got

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:08.450 
every block and then my computer got
upgraded<00:00:58.640> my<00:00:59.640> old<00:01:06.500> lost<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.740> world<00:01:07.950> finally

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
upgraded my old lost the world finally

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.460 
upgraded my old lost the world finally
didn't<00:01:08.700> know<00:01:08.790> where<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:08.970> was<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.600> today<00:01:10.439> I

found it on my new laptop I had my my

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:32.270 
found it on my new laptop I had my my
hard<00:01:18.600> drive<00:01:25.400> yeah<00:01:27.799> map<00:01:28.799> uses<00:01:31.280> aperture

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
hard drive yeah map uses aperture

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:40.850 
hard drive yeah map uses aperture
enrichment<00:01:34.040> 16x<00:01:35.060> zip<00:01:36.060> by<00:01:36.470> Umbro<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:39.860> might

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
enrichment 16x zip by Umbro so I might

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.230 
enrichment 16x zip by Umbro so I might
put<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.159> link<00:01:41.369> in<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.610> description<00:01:41.700> for<00:01:42.090> that

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
put a link in the description for that

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.080 
put a link in the description for that
I'm<00:01:42.450> probably<00:01:42.659> not<00:01:43.140> because<00:01:43.320> it's<00:01:43.619> lazy<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:45.000> I

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
I'm probably not because it's lazy and I

so let's start off this is the entrance

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.560 
so let's start off this is the entrance
inside<00:01:53.430> this<00:01:53.550> chamber<00:01:54.710> first<00:01:55.710> game<00:01:55.980> a<00:01:56.570> little

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
inside this chamber first game a little

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.850 
inside this chamber first game a little
aperture<00:01:58.290> enrichment<00:01:59.190> and<00:01:59.910> sing<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:01.140> here<00:02:01.710> we

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
aperture enrichment and sing and here we

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.910 
aperture enrichment and sing and here we
have<00:02:02.010> his<00:02:02.040> GLaDOS<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:06.320> GLaDOS<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:07.800> then

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
have his GLaDOS and GLaDOS and then

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.490 
have his GLaDOS and GLaDOS and then
there's<00:02:08.100> the<00:02:08.460> screens<00:02:09.350> originally<00:02:10.350> there

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
there's the screens originally there

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.110 
there's the screens originally there
were<00:02:10.590> paintings<00:02:10.860> on<00:02:11.310> here<00:02:11.550> I<00:02:11.760> don't<00:02:11.790> know<00:02:12.000> what

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
were paintings on here I don't know what

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.420 
were paintings on here I don't know what
happens<00:02:12.480> but<00:02:12.570> it<00:02:13.530> was<00:02:13.650> supposed<00:02:13.800> to<00:02:14.040> look<00:02:14.370> like

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
happens but it was supposed to look like

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.310 
happens but it was supposed to look like
the<00:02:14.760> spazzing<00:02:15.210> out<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.450> screens<00:02:15.720> from<00:02:16.170> the

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
the spazzing out the screens from the

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.030 
the spazzing out the screens from the
game<00:02:17.540> yeah<00:02:18.540> there's<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:18.920> and<00:02:19.920> then

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
game yeah there's that and then

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.120 
game yeah there's that and then
therefore<00:02:20.480> i'm<00:02:21.480> neurotoxin<00:02:22.320> events<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:25.130> on

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
therefore i'm neurotoxin events and on

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.400 
therefore i'm neurotoxin events and on
the<00:02:26.310> screen<00:02:26.580> right<00:02:26.760> there<00:02:27.320> originally<00:02:28.320> we'll

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
the screen right there originally we'll

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.840 
the screen right there originally we'll
have<00:02:28.650> this<00:02:28.740> battling<00:02:29.130> out<00:02:29.220> things<00:02:29.460> on<00:02:29.640> and

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
have this battling out things on and

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.310 
have this battling out things on and
then<00:02:29.940> they<00:02:30.060> turned<00:02:30.330> into<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.630> neurotoxin

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
then they turned into the neurotoxin

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.130 
then they turned into the neurotoxin
counting<00:02:32.250> down<00:02:32.340> things<00:02:32.750> then<00:02:33.750> there's<00:02:33.990> this

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
counting down things then there's this

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.340 
counting down things then there's this
little<00:02:34.320> maintenance<00:02:35.810> glassing<00:02:36.810> around

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
little maintenance glassing around

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.990 
little maintenance glassing around
GLaDOS<00:02:38.540> and<00:02:39.540> then<00:02:39.900> right<00:02:40.080> here<00:02:40.260> is<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:41.000> little

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
GLaDOS and then right here is the little

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.540 
GLaDOS and then right here is the little
thing<00:02:42.720> that<00:02:42.750> holds<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.830> button<00:02:44.100> for<00:02:44.400> the

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
thing that holds the button for the

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.240 
thing that holds the button for the
incinerator<00:02:48.470> and<00:02:49.470> then<00:02:49.680> you<00:02:49.800> would<00:02:49.920> drop<00:02:50.070> this

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
incinerator and then you would drop this

00:02:50.250 --> 00:03:02.810 
incinerator and then you would drop this
thing<00:02:50.310> in<00:02:58.970> no<00:02:59.970> please<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.489> whole<00:03:02.640> thing

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
thing in no please and the whole thing

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.910 
thing in no please and the whole thing
would<00:03:02.970> explode<00:03:03.360> that<00:03:04.230> was<00:03:04.440> a<00:03:04.470> really<00:03:04.709> bad

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
would explode that was a really bad

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.610 
would explode that was a really bad
impression<00:03:05.370> of<00:03:05.430> butters<00:03:05.780> but<00:03:06.780> on<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.500> end

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
impression of butters but on the end

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.870 
impression of butters but on the end
then<00:03:07.739> there's<00:03:07.950> her<00:03:08.070> the<00:03:08.220> rocket<00:03:08.489> turret<00:03:08.760> and

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
then there's her the rocket turret and

then there's her the rocket turret and
come<00:03:09.030> out<00:03:09.150> of<00:03:09.300> and<00:03:09.570> let's<00:03:09.780> see<00:03:09.989> if<00:03:10.020> I<00:03:10.200> can

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
come out of and let's see if I can

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:19.000 
come out of and let's see if I can

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:19.150 
originally I had made this one time and

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.600 
originally I had made this one time and
then<00:06:19.840> the<00:06:19.960> map<00:06:20.139> got<00:06:20.410> deleted<00:06:20.770> for<00:06:21.130> some<00:06:21.280> reason

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 
and then I mean again I got deleted

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.159 
and then I mean again I got deleted
because<00:06:24.880> it<00:06:25.090> was<00:06:25.210> time<00:06:25.389> and<00:06:25.419> my<00:06:25.720> computer

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:26.169 
because it was time and my computer

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:28.320 
because it was time and my computer
crashed<00:06:26.560> because<00:06:26.800> at<00:06:27.100> the<00:06:27.220> time<00:06:27.400> my<00:06:27.460> old

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:28.330 
crashed because at the time my old

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.310 
crashed because at the time my old
laptop<00:06:28.479> was<00:06:28.870> suffering<00:06:30.360> repeated<00:06:31.360> random

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:32.320 
laptop was suffering repeated random

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:38.250 
laptop was suffering repeated random
crashing<00:06:33.840> through<00:06:34.840> weird<00:06:35.229> and<00:06:36.270> I<00:06:37.270> forgot<00:06:38.139> to

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:38.260 
crashing through weird and I forgot to

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.790 
crashing through weird and I forgot to
leave<00:06:38.410> it<00:06:38.530> and<00:06:38.620> then<00:06:38.770> I<00:06:38.800> made<00:06:38.979> this<00:06:39.130> one<00:06:39.190> and<00:06:40.800> I

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:41.800 
leave it and then I made this one and I

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.290 
leave it and then I made this one and I
think<00:06:42.280> really<00:06:42.430> it<00:06:42.639> didn't<00:06:42.849> crash<00:06:43.090> or<00:06:43.270> anything
