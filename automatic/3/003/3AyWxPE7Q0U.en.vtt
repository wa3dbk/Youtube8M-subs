 installing the DVR glue 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:00.640
 its not recommended plus the fact that 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.590
 the bracket takes up minimal space and if 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.810
 do you want to lock the device up 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.659

 sensor bridge 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.840
 The maximum video resolution is 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.739
 1920 by 1080 pixels with a frequency of 30 frames 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.410
 per second 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:38.769
 You can set the frequency of 60 frames in 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.200
 a second but only for 720p resolution 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.120
 the smoothness of the transmission is significantly 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.790
 will increase but it will have to 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.680
 pay a little down from 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.099

 file breakdown and frame loss is not 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.510
 observed after filling the card 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:03:00.360
 memory the oldest files start 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.580
 removed and replaced but 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.040
 me sound recording by 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.380
 You can disable the shock sensor 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.570
 allows you to automatically start recording

 if there is an emergency 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.830
 collision fixed 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.770
 DVR save to separate 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.860
 folder all the data a minute before 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:22.830
 and a minute after the event this file is not 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.990
 erased when overwriting emergency mode 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.720
 recordings can also be activated and 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:30.330
 manually pressing the extreme button on 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.160
 device during regular shooting in 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.260
 normal operation registrar 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.020
 starts recording automatically when 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.510
 turning on the ignition and the appearance of power 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:42.060
 on the charger lens with an angle 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.190
 120 degree view is excellent 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.890
 captures not only the roadway 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.170
 in front of you but the sidewalks and neighboring 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.360
 strip detail shooting in daylight 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.670
 the conditions are good neighboring rooms 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.170
 cars are well distinguishable in the dark 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.690
 the video starts to make noise 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.270
 so you have to rely mostly 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.790
 on the headlights of your car separate 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.070
 there is no night mode in the device 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.470
 because of the high resolution of the recorder 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:11.040
 speed is recommended 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.870
 memory cards of class 6 and above recorded 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.150
 videos can be viewed directly on 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.519
 device or download to computer 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:21.000
 they are stored in the mov container with 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:23.100
 h264 codec and reproduced 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.160
 standard means any 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.870
 Modern operating systems have 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:31.200
 the recorder also has a built-in 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.940
 memory of 512 megabytes it is not 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.100
 used for recording 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.910
 but it can be copied from the card 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.280
 micro sd 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.050
 most important storage rollers 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.140
 bush and 5 city 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.729
 inexpensive compact video recorder 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.530
 able to shoot video in high format 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:48.419
 full hd definition 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.760
 undoubted advantages of the model can be 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:53.040
 include decent recording quality 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.430
 built-in memory for storing important 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.430
