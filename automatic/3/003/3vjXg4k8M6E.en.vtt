00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.040 

it's<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:37.140> demon<00:00:37.469> fish<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:38.540> deem<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.629> fisheye<00:00:40.020> lens

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.840 
it's a demon fish I deem a fisheye lens
I<00:00:44.329> think<00:00:45.329> it's<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.600> 71<00:00:46.219> whatever<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.550> range

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
I think it's a 71 whatever in that range

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.850 
I think it's a 71 whatever in that range
and<00:00:48.210> then<00:00:48.570> there's<00:00:48.750> cheaper<00:00:49.170> ones<00:00:49.379> like<00:00:49.620> 30

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
and then there's cheaper ones like 30

def and I got a UAB Phil UV filter I'm
gonna<00:01:24.180> show<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:25.290> that's<00:01:25.439> how<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.650> works

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.560 

zoom<00:01:29.159> in

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:50.930 

now<00:01:34.610> I'll<00:01:35.610> show<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:35.850> how<00:01:35.910> looks<00:01:49.190> so<00:01:50.190> this

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
now I'll show you how looks so this

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
now I'll show you how looks so this
isn't<00:01:51.890> this<00:01:52.890> silver<00:01:53.460> thing<00:01:53.729> on<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.970> top<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.510> it

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
isn't this silver thing on the top is it

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.010 
isn't this silver thing on the top is it
the<00:01:55.260> filter<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:58.760> would<00:01:59.760> advise<00:02:00.510> getting<00:02:00.750> this

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
the filter I would advise getting this

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.639 
the filter I would advise getting this
because<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:02.130> protects<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.180> ones<00:02:03.420> from<00:02:03.840> dust

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
because it protects the ones from dust

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.859 
because it protects the ones from dust
and<00:02:05.040> scratching<00:02:05.910> and<00:02:06.149> everything<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.720> make<00:02:06.840> it

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
and scratching and everything to make it

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:17.500 
and scratching and everything to make it
more<00:02:07.520> make<00:02:08.520> it<00:02:08.670> more<00:02:08.759> clear<00:02:13.430> and<00:02:14.430> here's<00:02:15.090> one

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
more make it more clear and here's one

right here to adjust it so when you put

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.670 
right here to adjust it so when you put
