it<00:00:46.590> being<00:00:46.739> effectual<00:00:47.399> we<00:00:47.940> don't<00:00:48.210> know<00:00:48.420> what

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
it being effectual we don't know what

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.080 
it being effectual we don't know what
two<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.230> cards<00:00:49.530> do<00:00:49.680> yet<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.610> gear<00:00:50.820> gear

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
two of the cards do yet the gear gear

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.520 
two of the cards do yet the gear gear
the<00:00:51.270> brand<00:00:51.510> new<00:00:51.629> exceeds<00:00:51.960> monster<00:00:52.379> that

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
the brand new exceeds monster that

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.420 
the brand new exceeds monster that
requires<00:00:52.860> two<00:00:53.629> level<00:00:54.629> freeze<00:00:54.930> or<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.920> lights

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
requires two level freeze or the lights

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.279 
requires two level freeze or the lights
11<00:00:56.820> which<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.120> level<00:00:57.329> 7<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:58.050> I'm<00:00:58.109> pretty

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
11 which is a level 7 and I'm pretty

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.529 
11 which is a level 7 and I'm pretty
sure<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.620> requires<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.100> less<00:00:59.370> 1mon<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.120> know<00:01:00.359> or

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
sure it requires a less 1mon to know or

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.330 
sure it requires a less 1mon to know or
something<00:01:00.719> like<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.260> keep<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.649> specific

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
something like that to keep it specific

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.920 
something like that to keep it specific
so<00:01:02.550> we<00:01:02.640> can<00:01:02.789> have<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.940> broken<00:01:03.210> effect<00:01:03.629> but<00:01:03.750> not

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
so we can have a broken effect but not

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.260 
so we can have a broken effect but not
be<00:01:04.049> abusive<00:01:04.680> anyway<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.339> nice<00:01:05.549> one<00:01:05.820> stuff<00:01:06.060> so

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
be abusive anyway the nice one stuff so

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.240 
be abusive anyway the nice one stuff so
they<00:01:06.390> got<00:01:06.510> their<00:01:06.689> level<00:01:06.930> 7<00:01:07.200> syncro<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.830> it's

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
they got their level 7 syncro and it's

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.770 
they got their level 7 syncro and it's
like<00:01:08.400> okay<00:01:08.760> so<00:01:08.820> how<00:01:09.119> they<00:01:09.299> can<00:01:09.420> have<00:01:09.510> some<00:01:09.659> in

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
like okay so how they can have some in

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.390 
like okay so how they can have some in
this<00:01:09.869> fame<00:01:10.110> because<00:01:10.290> there's<00:01:10.770> no<00:01:10.920> way<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.130> sign

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
this fame because there's no way to sign

more<00:02:54.690> to<00:02:54.900> you<00:02:55.109> get<00:02:55.290> to<00:02:55.470> you<00:02:55.680> get<00:02:55.829> 400<00:02:56.159> attack<00:02:56.639> I

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
more to you get to you get 400 attack I

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.640 
more to you get to you get 400 attack I
think<00:02:57.030> it's<00:02:57.150> just<00:02:57.209> 200<00:02:57.959> regardless<00:02:58.409> of<00:02:58.530> how

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
think it's just 200 regardless of how

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.860 
think it's just 200 regardless of how
many<00:02:58.709> you<00:02:59.010> mill<00:02:59.220> that<00:02:59.549> makes<00:03:00.030> it<00:03:00.180> go<00:03:00.239> up<00:03:00.299> to<00:03:00.480> 19

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
many you mill that makes it go up to 19

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.289 
many you mill that makes it go up to 19
so<00:03:01.079> if<00:03:01.200> you<00:03:01.290> mail<00:03:01.440> a<00:03:01.470> wolf<00:03:01.739> then<00:03:02.250> you<00:03:02.579> can<00:03:02.909> swing

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
so if you mail a wolf then you can swing

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.030 
so if you mail a wolf then you can swing
for<00:03:03.720> thousands<00:03:04.170> on<00:03:04.230> an<00:03:04.319> empty<00:03:04.470> field<00:03:04.829> and

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
for thousands on an empty field and

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.680 
for thousands on an empty field and
that's<00:03:05.400> one<00:03:05.579> thing<00:03:05.609> I<00:03:05.879> like<00:03:06.060> about<00:03:06.090> this<00:03:06.359> card

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
that's one thing I like about this card

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.830 
that's one thing I like about this card
is<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:07.019> fact<00:03:07.200> that<00:03:07.290> light<00:03:08.250> swarms<00:03:08.670> are<00:03:08.879> in<00:03:09.359> my

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
is the fact that light swarms are in my

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.680 
is the fact that light swarms are in my
opinion<00:03:10.109> they're<00:03:10.829> very<00:03:11.099> very<00:03:11.310> risk<00:03:11.790> high<00:03:12.389> risk

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
opinion they're very very risk high risk

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.750 
opinion they're very very risk high risk
high<00:03:12.780> reward<00:03:13.319> your<00:03:13.739> milling<00:03:14.040> a<00:03:14.129> lot<00:03:14.310> you<00:03:14.519> can

high reward your milling a lot you can

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.819 
high reward your milling a lot you can
take<00:03:14.970> yourself<00:03:15.359> out<00:03:15.540> but<00:03:16.169> at<00:03:16.349> the<00:03:16.440> same<00:03:16.620> time

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
you generally have to hold back yourself

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.479 
you generally have to hold back yourself
until<00:03:18.959> you<00:03:19.079> make<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.410> final<00:03:19.799> push<00:03:19.980> with<00:03:20.250> JD

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
going to be and this card is really

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:13.280 
going to be and this card is really
going<00:04:11.970> to<00:04:12.060> put<00:04:12.209> in<00:04:12.299> work<00:04:12.479> of<00:04:12.690> course<00:04:12.930> you<00:04:13.109> can

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
going to put in work of course you can

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.949 
going to put in work of course you can
combine<00:04:13.530> it<00:04:13.799> with<00:04:13.829> Lumina<00:04:14.400> to<00:04:14.849> make<00:04:15.090> a<00:04:15.269> level<00:04:15.599> 7

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
combine it with Lumina to make a level 7

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.750 
combine it with Lumina to make a level 7
so<00:04:16.079> you<00:04:16.169> can<00:04:16.320> make<00:04:16.409> black<00:04:16.680> rose<00:04:16.859> dragon<00:04:17.370> you

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
so you can make black rose dragon you

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.879 
so you can make black rose dragon you
can<00:04:17.969> make<00:04:18.180> the<00:04:18.389> level<00:04:18.840> 7<00:04:19.200> syncro<00:04:19.440> that<00:04:19.739> they're

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
can make the level 7 syncro that they're

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.140 
can make the level 7 syncro that they're
going<00:04:20.010> to<00:04:20.070> get<00:04:20.250> so<00:04:20.579> there's<00:04:20.820> tons<00:04:21.060> of

going to get so there's tons of
different<00:04:21.239> things<00:04:21.570> you

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
different things you

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.679 
different things you
do<00:04:21.979> with<00:04:22.189> it<00:04:22.340> as<00:04:22.520> opposed<00:04:23.060> to<00:04:23.180> the<00:04:23.330> other<00:04:23.449> one

00:04:23.679 --> 00:04:23.689 
do with it as opposed to the other one

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:25.379 
do with it as opposed to the other one
another<00:04:24.020> which<00:04:24.319> doesn't<00:04:24.680> really<00:04:24.770> do<00:04:25.039> anything

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389 
another which doesn't really do anything

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.570 
another which doesn't really do anything
doesn't<00:04:26.389> do<00:04:26.569> enough<00:04:26.689> so<00:04:27.439> this<00:04:27.770> card<00:04:28.009> is<00:04:28.189> really

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
doesn't do enough so this card is really

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.820 
doesn't do enough so this card is really
going<00:04:28.699> to<00:04:28.789> put<00:04:29.150> it's<00:04:29.629> going<00:04:29.840> to<00:04:29.900> put<00:04:30.289> itself<00:04:30.650> to

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
going to put it's going to put itself to

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.589 
going to put it's going to put itself to
work<00:04:31.039> and<00:04:31.280> maybe<00:04:31.520> you<00:04:31.759> will<00:04:31.939> be<00:04:32.120> running<00:04:32.330> one

00:04:32.589 --> 00:04:32.599 
work and maybe you will be running one

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:35.559 
work and maybe you will be running one
or<00:04:32.750> two<00:04:32.900> s<00:04:32.960> depending<00:04:33.500> on<00:04:33.620> what<00:04:34.280> happens<00:04:34.569> now

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:35.569 
or two s depending on what happens now

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:37.659 
or two s depending on what happens now
the<00:04:35.629> other<00:04:35.960> stuff<00:04:36.439> is<00:04:36.650> the<00:04:37.039> Duelist<00:04:37.430> set

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
the other stuff is the Duelist set

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:40.020 
the other stuff is the Duelist set
what's<00:04:38.180> it<00:04:38.300> called<00:04:38.509> machine<00:04:39.020> gear<00:04:39.349> troopers

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
what's it called machine gear troopers

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.209 
what's it called machine gear troopers
sounds<00:04:41.030> stupid<00:04:41.240> but<00:04:41.569> you<00:04:41.900> know<00:04:42.050> and<00:04:42.289> so<00:04:42.979> to<00:04:43.099> get

00:04:43.209 --> 00:04:43.219 
sounds stupid but you know and so to get

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:44.679 
sounds stupid but you know and so to get
a<00:04:43.250> brand-new<00:04:43.610> exceeds<00:04:44.000> monster<00:04:44.360> on<00:04:44.449> you<00:04:44.539> get

00:04:44.679 --> 00:04:44.689 
a brand-new exceeds monster on you get

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:46.390 
a brand-new exceeds monster on you get
two<00:04:44.810> new<00:04:44.990> monsters<00:04:45.379> so<00:04:45.620> they<00:04:45.740> get<00:04:45.889> an<00:04:46.069> exceeds

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
two new monsters so they get an exceeds

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.790 
two new monsters so they get an exceeds
monster<00:04:46.729> cool<00:04:46.939> gear<00:04:47.389> gear<00:04:47.659> gear<00:04:47.930> cross<00:04:48.319> giant

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.520 
monster cool gear gear gear cross giant
gigant<00:04:49.639> so<00:04:50.150> it's<00:04:50.330> a<00:04:50.389> bit<00:04:50.539> of<00:04:50.569> a<00:04:50.719> mess<00:04:50.930> but<00:04:50.960> to<00:04:51.409> be

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
gigant so it's a bit of a mess but to be

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.050 
gigant so it's a bit of a mess but to be
fair<00:04:51.740> it'll<00:04:52.129> probably<00:04:52.280> be<00:04:52.460> changed<00:04:52.819> when<00:04:52.939> it

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
fair it'll probably be changed when it

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.170 
fair it'll probably be changed when it
comes<00:04:53.240> to<00:04:53.449> the<00:04:53.539> tcd<00:04:54.050> and<00:04:54.699> requires<00:04:55.699> two<00:04:55.879> level

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
comes to the tcd and requires two level

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.909 
comes to the tcd and requires two level
freeze<00:04:56.389> I<00:04:56.870> don't<00:04:57.289> really<00:04:57.379> know<00:04:57.530> I<00:04:57.560> think<00:04:57.770> it's

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
freeze I don't really know I think it's

00:04:57.919 --> 00:04:59.830 
freeze I don't really know I think it's
two<00:04:58.039> level<00:04:58.250> three<00:04:58.280> machines<00:04:58.759> and<00:04:59.030> obviously

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
two level three machines and obviously

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.330 
two level three machines and obviously
that<00:05:00.050> means<00:05:00.080> you<00:05:00.319> can<00:05:00.500> use<00:05:00.710> giggy<00:05:01.099> on<00:05:01.129> your

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
that means you can use giggy on your

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.249 
that means you can use giggy on your
mark<00:05:01.550> 2<00:05:01.729> to<00:05:02.000> special<00:05:02.330> summon<00:05:02.449> a<00:05:02.690> gear<00:05:03.050> on<00:05:03.110> it

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:03.259 
mark 2 to special summon a gear on it

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:04.779 
mark 2 to special summon a gear on it
from<00:05:03.409> your<00:05:03.530> grave<00:05:03.740> and<00:05:04.039> then<00:05:04.129> you<00:05:04.280> can<00:05:04.460> exceed

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:04.789 
from your grave and then you can exceed

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:07.570 
from your grave and then you can exceed
them<00:05:04.969> together<00:05:05.270> for<00:05:05.479> this<00:05:05.659> so<00:05:06.139> it<00:05:07.009> is<00:05:07.069> doable

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
them together for this so it is doable

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.189 
them together for this so it is doable
in<00:05:07.819> one<00:05:07.969> card<00:05:08.240> you<00:05:08.360> just<00:05:08.509> have<00:05:08.629> to<00:05:08.719> set<00:05:08.900> it<00:05:08.930> up<00:05:09.080> a

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:09.199 
in one card you just have to set it up a

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:11.020 
in one card you just have to set it up a
little<00:05:09.319> bit<00:05:09.469> so<00:05:09.979> the<00:05:10.190> thing<00:05:10.370> is<00:05:10.490> that<00:05:10.520> if

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
little bit so the thing is that if

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.490 
little bit so the thing is that if
that's<00:05:11.240> the<00:05:11.449> case<00:05:11.629> then<00:05:11.690> it's<00:05:12.080> gonna<00:05:12.259> require

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
that's the case then it's gonna require

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.219 
that's the case then it's gonna require
you<00:05:13.009> to<00:05:13.219> really<00:05:13.490> need<00:05:13.789> a<00:05:14.029> decent<00:05:14.569> of<00:05:14.900> it<00:05:15.080> to

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:15.229 
you to really need a decent of it to

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:16.809 
you to really need a decent of it to
make<00:05:15.379> it<00:05:15.440> someone<00:05:15.889> worth<00:05:16.099> it<00:05:16.340> because<00:05:16.520> I'm<00:05:16.699> the

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:16.819 
make it someone worth it because I'm the

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:18.189 
make it someone worth it because I'm the
way<00:05:16.940> you're<00:05:17.090> just<00:05:17.240> going<00:05:17.389> to<00:05:17.449> use<00:05:17.629> gear<00:05:17.990> gear

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:18.199 
way you're just going to use gear gear

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:20.260 
way you're just going to use gear gear
gear<00:05:18.500> to<00:05:19.219> actually<00:05:19.550> just<00:05:19.729> summon<00:05:20.029> and<00:05:20.150> make

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
gear to actually just summon and make

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.300 
gear to actually just summon and make
them<00:05:20.389> level<00:05:20.599> 4<00:05:20.779> make<00:05:20.990> guy<00:05:21.680> guy<00:05:21.830> necks<00:05:22.069> instead

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
them level 4 make guy guy necks instead

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.890 
them level 4 make guy guy necks instead
because<00:05:22.729> it's<00:05:22.909> more<00:05:23.029> consistent<00:05:23.569> you<00:05:23.750> get

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
because it's more consistent you get

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.439 
because it's more consistent you get
such<00:05:24.259> machines<00:05:25.069> you<00:05:25.580> know<00:05:25.729> you<00:05:25.940> can't<00:05:26.060> say<00:05:26.300> no

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:26.449 
such machines you know you can't say no

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:28.180 
such machines you know you can't say no
to<00:05:26.479> them<00:05:26.750> so<00:05:27.229> the<00:05:27.319> other<00:05:27.440> two<00:05:27.620> cards<00:05:27.919> they<00:05:28.009> get

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
to them so the other two cards they get

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.999 
to them so the other two cards they get
is<00:05:28.389> Giggy<00:05:29.389> attacker<00:05:29.719> I<00:05:30.020> really<00:05:30.529> hate<00:05:30.650> this<00:05:30.770> car
