00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.720
 hello how about health friends to santi de 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.580
 fishing and hunting with salt this day we are going to 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.370
 make a trap which has been 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.920
 very useful and today I want to share 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.290
 for you to justify that 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.239
 that if it works that they put it in 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:44.590
 practice either in the day or at night 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:47.589
 this trap is left approximately 12 o 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.570
 15 hours is the time the act that I the 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:53.210
 I leave for you 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.520
 check then nothing we are going to do it 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.790
 The materials that we are going to use are 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:02.090
 two mayonnaise pots of these three 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:05.180
 kilos are four bars of milk of 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:09.290
 plastic like these the tool that 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:13.060
 we will use tweezers nippers you 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:17.930
 of electrician the cutter scissors 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:20.340
 a staple drill hole stapler of this 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.130
 they use for the linings 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.840
 and annealed wire 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.789
 what is going to do the only thing that we are going to 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.570
 need to make our trap 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:34.229
 then it is so let's start let's start 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:37.200
 let's start with the boxes these 4 to 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:41.280
 the 4 of us are going to make this break in 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:45.030
 this side and we're going to leave all 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.009
 equal to each one on the opposite side 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.829
 let's give a break in the handle 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:53.229
 and also let's do the first thing with 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.759
 2 and we are going to join them in this way 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.460
 let's do the same with the other two 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:02.810
 and we are going to get this because they must 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:07.100
 get these holes in the center of the 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:09.979
 back of the boxes now we continue 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.050
 with mayonnaise jars to these boats 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.630
 we are going to cut the top side 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:18.570
 where is the gap 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.240
 we'll cut the other end but 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.860
 there are going to be the peaks this with these 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.290
 peaks come on is going to be the function of the 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.210
 trap so that we have the cuts them 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.230
 I will teach how to do it explained the 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.710
 Minister 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.380
 these peaks are going to go three peaks in each 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:37.070
 line in this way I do not know if what 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.070
 reach to see 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.120
 and the peaks do not matter they should be more 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.610
 or less here to the trial of the image that 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.500
 I give them the other end we are going to do 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.220
 these cuts these cuts are going to 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.440
 serve to apply them towards the box has 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.350
 obtained this to the peaks we are going to give 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.780
 a small fold towards the center for 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.020
 let the cage remain so that it looks like 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:04.020
 some claws then if I explained myself and 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:07.260
 this way already getting this with the 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.480
 We are going to fix them to the box 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.820
 towards the holes that we leave for 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.740
 that we cut the handles we're going to 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.290
 put in this way for that let's 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.900
 use it in linings stapler and now 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:22.290
 it has to stay like this, here I will 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.860
 add some the wires and so that 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:28.709
 there is a fault or way of escape 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.750
 for the weight and already having this 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.330
 We continue with the next step that is 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.569
 the creation of the door we are going to take 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.480
 one side of the box 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.849
 some wall we still do not join it let's go 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.780
 to take one that I leave this as 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:49.400
 reference and we're going to cut it with the 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:52.189
 router all the walls already having that 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.950
 we're going to make three holes in the 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:58.160
 at the door 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:01.550
 and one that's going to be like insurance one 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:04.280
 box in that piercing between the two 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:07.370
 we are going to put this good 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.650
 I put this thread which is strong 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.650
 and no no tend not escape or 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.150
 tico high chairs and is depending on you and 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.600
 it could be a wire 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.850
 something any anything with a 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.190
 Thread is already rape to a cord we are going to 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.570
 do what the float treaters 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.200
 so that we will not miss the 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:30.590
 trap or not lose sight of it and already what 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:33.950
 they can tie it from the extreme that is and the 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:36.740
 another extreme put a unicel bottle or 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:39.260
 something what you like with other hooks 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.000
 we are going to put these hooks 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.360
 which will help us to take the 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.300
 bait and depending on how big you 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.729
 or the ingenuity that I have I put a 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.130
 little sachet something like a sock on the 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:55.490
 which I have made the bait which 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:57.289
 they release the aromas and jalal to the fish 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:01.039
 now let's continue with the next 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:04.250
 step for almost we have ready the box already 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:06.440
 nothing else would be to unite it for the union 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.389
 We are going to drill in each 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.380
 end in an equal way so that they remain 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:15.050
 couple we are going to unite in this way 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:17.990
 we would stay like this already getting this 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:20.990
 we're almost ready, we just have to cover 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:23.060
 or give a cooked with wire to all 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.090
 handles that we have left a little 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:28.580
 big there if you can go the prey 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:30.849
 then you are already getting this 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:34.940
 should be like this here I show you the 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:38.539
 last photo of the project already finished 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:41.360
 and then this way we should stay or at least 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:43.610
 soon you must have these ideas 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.430
 so that it works and well, well, this 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:49.430
 It would be all from me before we left 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:51.650

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:54.169
