00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
out with his lot bunny and this I think

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.510 
out with his lot bunny and this I think
he's<00:00:31.019> using<00:00:31.170> his<00:00:31.439> counter<00:00:31.800> team<00:00:32.009> that<00:00:32.369> you

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
he's using his counter team that you

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.520 
he's using his counter team that you
know<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.700> counter<00:00:33.660> team<00:00:33.840> so<00:00:34.320> this<00:00:34.500> is

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
know the counter team so this is

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.900 
know the counter team so this is
actually<00:00:34.739> isn't<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.160> full<00:00:35.370> battle<00:00:35.670> but<00:00:35.820> its

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
actually isn't a full battle but its

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.810 
actually isn't a full battle but its
most<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.270> one<00:00:36.420> so<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:36.750> think<00:00:37.290> you'll<00:00:37.410> enjoy<00:00:37.469> it

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
most of one so I think you'll enjoy it

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.080 
most of one so I think you'll enjoy it
so<00:00:38.820> serenity<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:40.219> uses<00:00:41.219> flail<00:00:41.489> doesn't<00:00:41.910> do<00:00:41.969> much

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
on it and the cool thing is that

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.809 
on it and the cool thing is that
regigigas<00:02:22.420> is<00:02:22.959> I<00:02:23.170> think<00:02:23.230> it's<00:02:23.470> underused<00:02:23.830> but

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
regigigas is I think it's underused but

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.150 
regigigas is I think it's underused but
it's<00:02:25.630> it's<00:02:25.989> down<00:02:26.319> there<00:02:26.470> it's<00:02:26.590> not<00:02:26.739> overused

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
it's it's down there it's not overused

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.559 
it's it's down there it's not overused
which<00:02:27.400> is<00:02:27.520> really<00:02:27.700> cool<00:02:27.850> it's<00:02:27.970> not<00:02:28.090> even<00:02:28.270> uber

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
which is really cool it's not even uber

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.500 
which is really cool it's not even uber
but<00:02:28.989> I<00:02:29.020> think<00:02:29.319> it<00:02:29.380> should<00:02:29.560> be<00:02:29.590> because<00:02:30.510> you

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
but I think it should be because you

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:32.940 
but I think it should be because you
know<00:02:31.600> it's<00:02:31.720> pretty<00:02:31.840> cool<00:02:32.050> about<00:02:32.110> it<00:02:32.230> it<00:02:32.800> is
