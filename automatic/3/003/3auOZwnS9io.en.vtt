icons on your desktop or there's two

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.380 
icons on your desktop or there's two
things<00:00:16.500> that<00:00:16.770> I<00:00:16.890> can<00:00:17.070> think<00:00:17.220> of<00:00:17.460> right<00:00:17.789> now<00:00:18.029> and

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
things that I can think of right now and

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.150 
things that I can think of right now and
I'm<00:00:18.539> pretty<00:00:18.750> sure<00:00:18.960> you<00:00:19.080> can<00:00:19.260> find<00:00:19.439> other<00:00:19.680> uses

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
I'm pretty sure you can find other uses

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.640 
I'm pretty sure you can find other uses
as<00:00:20.310> well<00:00:20.480> but<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.810> main<00:00:22.080> ones<00:00:22.350> that<00:00:22.529> I<00:00:22.619> can

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
as well but the main ones that I can

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.099 
as well but the main ones that I can
think<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.460> for<00:00:23.490> one<00:00:23.939> if<00:00:24.180> you're<00:00:24.750> gonna<00:00:24.930> be

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
think of is for one if you're gonna be

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.810 
think of is for one if you're gonna be
doing<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.560> professional<00:00:25.820> business

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
doing a professional business

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.150 
doing a professional business
presentation<00:00:27.660> in<00:00:27.779> front<00:00:27.990> of<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.199> client<00:00:28.410> you

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
presentation in front of a client you

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.349 
presentation in front of a client you
probably<00:00:29.490> don't<00:00:29.670> want<00:00:29.849> them<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.150> see<00:00:30.330> all

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
probably don't want them to see all

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.630 
probably don't want them to see all
these<00:00:30.630> desktop<00:00:31.140> icons<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:32.309> if<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:32.460> haven't

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
these desktop icons so if you haven't

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.400 
these desktop icons so if you haven't
had<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.910> chance<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.329> clean<00:00:33.600> them<00:00:33.719> up<00:00:33.930> you

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
had a chance to clean them up you

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.959 
had a chance to clean them up you
probably<00:00:34.710> want<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:34.980> hide<00:00:35.190> them<00:00:35.460> for<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.760> time

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
probably want to hide them for the time

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.540 
probably want to hide them for the time
being<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:37.079> other<00:00:37.260> opportunity<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.070> think<00:00:38.370> that

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
being the other opportunity I think that

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.340 
being the other opportunity I think that
you<00:00:38.670> could<00:00:38.820> use<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.149> for<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.629> if<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.110> have<00:00:40.320> a

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
you could use it for is if you have a

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.770 
you could use it for is if you have a
little<00:00:40.620> one<00:00:40.829> running<00:00:41.070> around<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:42.180> tends<00:00:42.600> to

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
little one running around that tends to

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.500 
little one running around that tends to
touch<00:00:42.989> your<00:00:43.320> laptop<00:00:43.980> touchpad<00:00:44.550> or<00:00:44.850> if<00:00:45.390> you

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
touch your laptop touchpad or if you

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.630 
touch your laptop touchpad or if you
have<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.690> desktop<00:00:46.200> in<00:00:46.559> your<00:00:47.070> case<00:00:47.309> it<00:00:47.489> would<00:00:47.610> be

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
have a desktop in your case it would be

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.380 
have a desktop in your case it would be
a<00:00:47.789> mousepad

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
a mousepad

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.889 
a mousepad
so<00:00:49.340> even<00:00:50.340> either<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.820> those<00:00:50.940> cases<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:51.660> want

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
so even either of those cases you want

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.900 
so even either of those cases you want
to<00:00:51.989> probably<00:00:52.140> hide<00:00:52.469> your<00:00:52.680> desktop<00:00:53.100> icons<00:00:53.550> and

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
to probably hide your desktop icons and

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.330 
to probably hide your desktop icons and
one<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.660> want<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.110> hide<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.260> because<00:00:55.710> you

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
one you want to hide it because you

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.069 
one you want to hide it because you
don't<00:00:56.520> want<00:00:56.670> your<00:00:56.789> desktop<00:00:57.539> icons<00:00:57.930> to

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
don't want your desktop icons to

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.110 
don't want your desktop icons to
mysteriously<00:00:58.469> move<00:00:58.829> around<00:00:59.100> or<00:00:59.460> disappear<00:00:59.969> if

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
mysteriously move around or disappear if

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.389 
mysteriously move around or disappear if
your<00:01:00.359> little<00:01:00.660> one<00:01:00.780> has<00:01:01.020> clipped<00:01:01.949> on<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.250> and

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
your little one has clipped on it and

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.219 
your little one has clipped on it and
drag<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.760> somewhere<00:01:02.940> hit<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.899> delete<00:01:04.199> button

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
drag it somewhere hit the delete button

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.280 
drag it somewhere hit the delete button
somehow<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:06.000> can<00:01:06.150> prevent<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.630> by<00:01:06.840> hiding

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
somehow you can prevent that by hiding

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.679 
somehow you can prevent that by hiding
your<00:01:07.380> desktop<00:01:07.799> icons<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:09.060> in<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.330> case<00:01:09.510> of

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
your desktop icons and in the case of

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.260 
your desktop icons and in the case of
the<00:01:09.810> business<00:01:10.229> presentation<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.700> hide<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.090> so

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
the business presentation you hide it so

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.670 
the business presentation you hide it so
that<00:01:12.450> your<00:01:12.570> desktop<00:01:12.930> looks<00:01:13.080> really<00:01:13.409> clean<00:01:13.650> and
