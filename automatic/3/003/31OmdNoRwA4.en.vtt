00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
by having access off the iPad and

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.649

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
working from the iPad just makes it a

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.260 
working from the iPad just makes it a
little<00:01:39.840> cooler<00:01:40.200> than<00:01:40.590> having

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
little cooler than having

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.789 
little cooler than having
sit<00:01:41.390> in<00:01:41.509> front<00:01:41.750> of<00:01:41.840> it<00:01:41.960> and<00:01:42.079> press<00:01:42.259> the<00:01:42.409> buttons

just like touch here press here touch

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.950 
just like touch here press here touch
there<00:01:46.159> as<00:01:46.429> opposed<00:01:47.090> to<00:01:47.179> you<00:01:47.359> got<00:01:47.509> to<00:01:47.630> go<00:01:47.719> into

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
there as opposed to you got to go into

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.660 
there as opposed to you got to go into
different<00:01:48.259> types<00:01:48.500> of<00:01:48.710> pages<00:01:48.950> it's<00:01:49.369> a<00:01:49.460> little

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
different types of pages it's a little

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.380 
different types of pages it's a little
more<00:01:50.409> cumbersome<00:01:51.409> with<00:01:52.159> an<00:01:52.310> actual<00:01:52.640> module<00:01:52.909> I

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
more cumbersome with an actual module I

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.929 
more cumbersome with an actual module I
think<00:01:53.689> but<00:01:54.020> with<00:01:54.229> an<00:01:54.350> iPad<00:01:54.920> it<00:01:55.340> just<00:01:55.610> you<00:01:55.909> know

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
think but with an iPad it just you know

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:57.999 
think but with an iPad it just you know
it<00:01:56.780> makes<00:01:56.929> it<00:01:57.079> for<00:01:57.380> sometimes<00:01:57.649> it<00:01:57.770> makes<00:01:57.860> it

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
it makes it for sometimes it makes it

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.359 
it makes it for sometimes it makes it
funny<00:01:58.280> I<00:01:58.549> think<00:01:59.240> I<00:01:59.509> think<00:02:00.049> the<00:02:00.200> Integra<00:02:00.860> 7<00:02:01.250> is

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
funny I think I think the Integra 7 is

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.399 
funny I think I think the Integra 7 is
gonna<00:02:01.579> be<00:02:01.789> used<00:02:02.030> by<00:02:02.360> a<00:02:02.390> lot<00:02:02.869> of<00:02:02.899> different

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
gonna be used by a lot of different
