00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
of the others but I mean I'm not into

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.649 
of the others but I mean I'm not into
whipping<00:01:35.310> around<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.670> screen<00:01:36.060> really<00:01:36.420> fast

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
whipping around the screen really fast

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.510 
whipping around the screen really fast
this<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.140> more<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.439> face<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.890> mouse<00:01:38.100> maybe

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
this is more the face of a mouse maybe

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.649 
this is more the face of a mouse maybe
just<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.850> little<00:01:39.060> bit<00:01:39.150> slower<00:01:39.390> because

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
just a little bit slower because

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.260 
just a little bit slower because
sometimes<00:01:40.409> here<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:41.579> know<00:01:41.670> fiddling<00:01:42.090> but<00:01:42.240> I

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
sometimes here you know fiddling but I

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.609 
sometimes here you know fiddling but I
mean<00:01:42.420> if<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.600> like<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.899> really<00:01:42.990> fast<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.439> turn

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
mean if you like it really fast you turn

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.940 
mean if you like it really fast you turn
up<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.829> sensitivity<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.729> just<00:01:44.939> Rockets

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
up the sensitivity and it just Rockets

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.319 
up the sensitivity and it just Rockets
but<00:01:46.950> if<00:01:47.100> you're<00:01:47.450> you<00:01:48.450> know<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.840> don't<00:01:49.710> know<00:01:49.799> if<00:01:49.920> I

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
but if you're you know I don't know if I

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:52.609 
but if you're you know I don't know if I
dislike<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.750> rolls<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.380> little<00:01:52.409> bit

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
dislike that it rolls a little bit

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:53.780 
dislike that it rolls a little bit
slower<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:52.920> actually<00:01:53.100> kind<00:01:53.399> of<00:01:53.430> like<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.759> a

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
slower I actually kind of like it a

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.690 
slower I actually kind of like it a
little<00:01:53.880> bit<00:01:54.060> better<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:55.340> should<00:01:56.340> start<00:01:56.610> by

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
little bit better I should start by

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.859 
little bit better I should start by
saying<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:57.030> really<00:01:57.270> don't<00:01:57.420> like<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.719> other

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
saying I really don't like the other

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.770 
saying I really don't like the other
trackballs<00:01:58.350> at<00:01:58.680> all<00:01:58.829> where<00:01:59.700> it's<00:02:00.540> in<00:02:00.719> the

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
trackballs at all where it's in the

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.370 
trackballs at all where it's in the
middle<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.380> always<00:02:01.619> feel<00:02:01.860> uncomfortable<00:02:03.380> the

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
middle I always feel uncomfortable the

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.569 
middle I always feel uncomfortable the
only<00:02:04.530> reason<00:02:04.770> why<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:04.890> actually<00:02:05.040> turned<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.549> a

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
only reason why I actually turned to a

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.520 
only reason why I actually turned to a
trackball<00:02:05.850> was<00:02:06.270> because<00:02:06.570> I<00:02:06.750> was<00:02:06.869> getting<00:02:07.409> a

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
trackball was because I was getting a

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.469 
trackball was because I was getting a
lot<00:02:07.619> of<00:02:07.680> stress<00:02:07.979> in<00:02:08.009> my<00:02:08.220> wrists<00:02:08.610> spending<00:02:09.420> a

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
people had a problem with this I just

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.840 
people had a problem with this I just
put<00:02:35.370> my<00:02:35.580> pinky<00:02:35.940> right<00:02:36.210> on<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:37.370> B<00:02:38.370> right<00:02:38.580> click

put my pinky right on the B right click

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.440 
put my pinky right on the B right click
there<00:02:39.320> and<00:02:40.320> then<00:02:40.470> I<00:02:40.590> use<00:02:40.800> my<00:02:41.420> ring<00:02:42.420> finger

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
there and then I use my ring finger

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.360 
there and then I use my ring finger
middle<00:02:42.810> finger<00:02:43.110> to<00:02:43.560> actually<00:02:43.800> scroll<00:02:44.070> and

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
then my index finger just kind of

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.720 
then my index finger just kind of
relaxes<00:02:49.620> there<00:02:50.070> and<00:02:50.310> then<00:02:50.400> I<00:02:50.490> can<00:02:50.610> actually

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
relaxes there and then I can actually

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:51.980 
relaxes there and then I can actually
add<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.030> scroll<00:02:51.300> or<00:02:51.330> if<00:02:51.510> I<00:02:51.600> need<00:02:51.780> to<00:02:51.960> or

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
add the scroll or if I need to or

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.140 
add the scroll or if I need to or
whatever<00:02:52.800> and<00:02:53.100> then<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.340> thumb<00:02:53.550> is<00:02:53.700> obviously

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
whatever and then the thumb is obviously

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.470 
whatever and then the thumb is obviously
for<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:55.130> for<00:02:56.130> the<00:02:56.280> main<00:02:56.670> buttons<00:02:57.030> there<00:02:57.240> the

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
for the for the main buttons there the

for the for the main buttons there the
back<00:02:57.930> forth<00:02:58.320> in<00:02:58.620> them<00:02:59.450> the<00:03:00.450> left<00:03:00.660> click<00:03:02.240> my

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
back forth in them the left click my

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.590 
back forth in them the left click my
only<00:03:03.450> real<00:03:04.080> complaint<00:03:04.350> is<00:03:04.800> that<00:03:05.180> and<00:03:06.180> I<00:03:06.420> mean

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
only real complaint is that and I mean

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.970 
only real complaint is that and I mean
this<00:03:06.750> happens<00:03:07.080> with<00:03:07.230> all<00:03:07.350> track<00:03:07.620> bolts

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
this happens with all track bolts

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.370 
this happens with all track bolts
because<00:03:08.280> you<00:03:08.850> do<00:03:09.000> use<00:03:09.240> them<00:03:09.540> but<00:03:09.930> I'm<00:03:10.170> going<00:03:10.320> to

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
because you do use them but I'm going to

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.210 
because you do use them but I'm going to
try<00:03:10.530> and<00:03:10.620> get<00:03:10.740> the<00:03:10.830> marble<00:03:11.670> up<00:03:11.940> here<00:03:13.220> the

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
try and get the marble up here the

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.380 
try and get the marble up here the
marble<00:03:14.460> is<00:03:14.550> actually<00:03:14.790> really<00:03:14.940> easy<00:03:14.970> a<00:03:15.180> take

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
marble is actually really easy a take

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.000 
marble is actually really easy a take
out<00:03:15.540> it's<00:03:15.810> just<00:03:15.960> really<00:03:16.350> hard<00:03:16.560> to<00:03:16.680> do<00:03:16.800> it<00:03:16.920> with

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
out it's just really hard to do it with

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.150 
out it's just really hard to do it with
one<00:03:17.160> hand<00:03:18.080> down<00:03:19.080> here<00:03:19.440> there's<00:03:19.710> the<00:03:19.890> grips

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
one hand down here there's the grips

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.960 
one hand down here there's the grips
here<00:03:20.520> on<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.850> sides<00:03:21.290> and<00:03:22.290> then<00:03:23.160> you<00:03:23.220> have<00:03:23.610> here

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
here on the sides and then you have here

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.810 
here on the sides and then you have here
your<00:03:24.870> camera<00:03:25.260> that's<00:03:25.410> actually<00:03:25.700> picking<00:03:26.700> up

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
your camera that's actually picking up

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:33.080 
your camera that's actually picking up
the<00:03:28.070> the<00:03:29.070> ball<00:03:29.250> itself<00:03:29.900> a<00:03:31.550> lot<00:03:32.550> of<00:03:32.640> dirt<00:03:32.850> gets

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
the the ball itself a lot of dirt gets

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.000 
the the ball itself a lot of dirt gets
in<00:03:33.270> here<00:03:33.480> a<00:03:33.660> lot<00:03:33.870> of<00:03:33.960> like<00:03:34.080> dead<00:03:34.320> skin<00:03:34.560> cells

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
in here a lot of like dead skin cells

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.740 
in here a lot of like dead skin cells
and<00:03:35.190> stuff<00:03:35.430> and<00:03:35.670> it<00:03:35.790> really<00:03:36.270> kind<00:03:36.480> of<00:03:36.510> blocks

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
and stuff and it really kind of blocks

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.070 
and stuff and it really kind of blocks
up<00:03:36.960> out<00:03:37.350> the<00:03:37.650> holders<00:03:38.430> and<00:03:38.780> I<00:03:39.780> think<00:03:39.990> there

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
up out the holders and I think there

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.330 
up out the holders and I think there
might<00:03:40.170> be<00:03:40.230> even<00:03:40.350> small<00:03:40.710> sensors<00:03:41.070> in<00:03:41.220> those

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
might be even small sensors in those

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.130 
might be even small sensors in those
holders<00:03:41.730> because<00:03:42.630> they<00:03:42.810> kinda<00:03:43.020> have<00:03:43.110> like

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
holders because they kinda have like

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.330 
holders because they kinda have like
this<00:03:43.410> red<00:03:43.590> plastic<00:03:44.010> to<00:03:44.130> them<00:03:44.280> but<00:03:46.190> they<00:03:47.190> get

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
this red plastic to them but they get

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.520 
this red plastic to them but they get
gummed<00:03:47.640> up<00:03:47.820> and<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.720> ball<00:03:48.870> just<00:03:49.080> doesn't<00:03:49.200> turn

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
gummed up and the ball just doesn't turn

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.820 
gummed up and the ball just doesn't turn
that<00:03:49.740> well<00:03:49.920> it<00:03:50.340> doesn't<00:03:50.640> affect<00:03:50.880> like<00:03:51.060> the<00:03:52.050> the

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
that well it doesn't affect like the the

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.530 
that well it doesn't affect like the the
reading<00:03:53.040> of<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:53.580> ball<00:03:53.730> it<00:03:54.060> just<00:03:54.090> kind<00:03:54.480> of

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
reading of the ball it just kind of

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.180 
reading of the ball it just kind of
slows<00:03:54.780> it<00:03:54.960> down<00:03:54.990> a<00:03:55.110> bit<00:03:55.230> so<00:03:55.560> you<00:03:55.740> have<00:03:55.890> to<00:03:56.010> clean

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
slows it down a bit so you have to clean

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.070 
slows it down a bit so you have to clean
it<00:03:56.220> out<00:03:56.430> every<00:03:56.790> so<00:03:56.910> often<00:03:57.090> I<00:03:57.450> have<00:03:57.750> to<00:03:57.810> clean<00:03:58.050> it

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
it out every so often I have to clean it

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.440 
it out every so often I have to clean it
about<00:03:58.320> once<00:03:58.500> a<00:03:58.590> week<00:03:59.000> which<00:04:00.000> is<00:04:00.150> a<00:04:00.180> bit<00:04:00.360> of

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
about once a week which is a bit of

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.410 
about once a week which is a bit of
annoying<00:04:00.840> I<00:04:00.990> don't<00:04:01.320> know<00:04:01.410> it's<00:04:01.680> but<00:04:02.070> I<00:04:02.250> mean<00:04:02.550> it

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
annoying I don't know it's but I mean it

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.320 
annoying I don't know it's but I mean it
could<00:04:03.570> be<00:04:03.600> worse<00:04:03.830> as<00:04:04.830> you<00:04:05.130> can<00:04:05.250> see<00:04:05.430> all<00:04:05.970> my

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
could be worse as you can see all my

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.190 
could be worse as you can see all my
little<00:04:06.540> pads<00:04:06.810> are<00:04:06.990> falling<00:04:07.260> off<00:04:07.380> pretty<00:04:07.770> much

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
little pads are falling off pretty much

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.800 
little pads are falling off pretty much
that's<00:04:10.200> fine<00:04:10.500> I<00:04:10.530> mean<00:04:11.060> until<00:04:12.060> we<00:04:12.240> year<00:04:12.510> old<00:04:12.690> I

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
that's fine I mean until we year old I

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.720 
that's fine I mean until we year old I
don't<00:04:12.930> expect<00:04:13.500> much<00:04:13.800> the<00:04:14.130> batteries<00:04:14.550> I'm

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
don't expect much the batteries I'm

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.670 
don't expect much the batteries I'm
using<00:04:15.000> our<00:04:15.420> Duracell<00:04:15.930> rechargeable<00:04:16.440> they

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
using our Duracell rechargeable they

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.630 
using our Duracell rechargeable they
last<00:04:16.980> forever

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
last forever

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.810 
last forever
I<00:04:17.880> think<00:04:18.420> I've<00:04:18.570> changed<00:04:18.840> it<00:04:19.260> maybe<00:04:19.820> three

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
I think I've changed it maybe three

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.469 
I think I've changed it maybe three
times<00:04:20.970> here<00:04:21.330> if<00:04:21.930> that<00:04:22.140> so<00:04:23.100> I'm<00:04:23.940> really<00:04:24.240> kind<00:04:24.390> of

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
times here if that so I'm really kind of

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.840 
times here if that so I'm really kind of
happy<00:04:24.630> with<00:04:24.780> the<00:04:25.229> the<00:04:25.500> battery<00:04:25.830> life

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
happy with the the battery life

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
allows for a little bit more distance I

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.300 
allows for a little bit more distance I
actually<00:04:48.660> love<00:04:49.650> people<00:04:49.860> like<00:04:49.950> the<00:04:50.100> really

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:06.420 
mouse and then it stops reading it's

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.910 
mouse and then it stops reading it's
kind<00:05:06.630> of<00:05:06.660> ridiculous<00:05:06.960> this<00:05:07.350> one<00:05:07.590> you<00:05:07.740> can<00:05:07.890> put

I'm not trying to hide the Hadj tech
load<00:05:20.670> Oh<00:05:21.800> what<00:05:22.800> happened<00:05:23.730> and<00:05:24.060> this<00:05:24.510> happened

load Oh what happened and this happened
pretty<00:05:25.110> early<00:05:25.290> on<00:05:26.180> the<00:05:27.180> cable<00:05:27.570> pulls<00:05:27.810> out<00:05:27.990> of

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
pretty early on the cable pulls out of

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.320 
pretty early on the cable pulls out of
here<00:05:28.260> really<00:05:28.590> easily<00:05:29.190> and<00:05:29.250> frays<00:05:29.730> and<00:05:29.760> starts

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
here really easily and frays and starts

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.320 
here really easily and frays and starts
ripping<00:05:30.540> up<00:05:30.750> the<00:05:30.840> cable<00:05:31.260> so<00:05:32.130> what<00:05:32.970> I<00:05:33.030> did<00:05:33.090> is<00:05:33.180> I

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
ripping up the cable so what I did is I

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.450 
ripping up the cable so what I did is I
just<00:05:33.360> took<00:05:33.570> some<00:05:33.720> electrical<00:05:34.260> tape<00:05:34.440> and<00:05:34.740> I've

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
just took some electrical tape and I've

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.830 
just took some electrical tape and I've
wrapped<00:05:36.330> it<00:05:36.510> around<00:05:36.600> I<00:05:37.640> jammed<00:05:38.640> it<00:05:38.820> back<00:05:39.030> in<00:05:39.300> so

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
wrapped it around I jammed it back in so

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.470 
wrapped it around I jammed it back in so
that<00:05:40.020> it<00:05:40.500> wouldn't<00:05:40.830> come<00:05:41.040> out<00:05:41.180> jammed<00:05:42.180> it<00:05:42.360> in

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:42.480 
that it wouldn't come out jammed it in

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.510 
that it wouldn't come out jammed it in
and<00:05:42.720> then<00:05:42.840> I've<00:05:43.020> basically<00:05:43.350> supported<00:05:44.220> it<00:05:44.370> in

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
and then I've basically supported it in

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.890 
and then I've basically supported it in
place<00:05:44.820> so<00:05:45.000> I'm<00:05:45.060> not<00:05:45.180> actually<00:05:45.360> covering<00:05:45.780> up

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
place so I'm not actually covering up

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.520 
place so I'm not actually covering up
any<00:05:46.160> frayed<00:05:47.160> cables<00:05:47.670> I'm<00:05:47.850> just<00:05:48.380> holding<00:05:49.380> it<00:05:49.470> in

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
any frayed cables I'm just holding it in

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.370 
any frayed cables I'm just holding it in
place<00:05:49.650> so<00:05:49.950> they<00:05:50.070> can<00:05:50.100> no<00:05:50.370> longer<00:05:50.400> pull<00:05:51.140> do<00:05:52.140> this

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:28.260 
side and then taped it so that the tape

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.560 
side and then taped it so that the tape
kind<00:06:28.560> of<00:06:28.650> holds<00:06:29.070> it<00:06:29.160> in<00:06:29.250> place<00:06:29.400> but<00:06:30.240> not<00:06:30.360> worked
