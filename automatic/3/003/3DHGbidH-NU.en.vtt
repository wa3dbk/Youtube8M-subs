change<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:19.019> dynamic<00:03:19.530> behavior

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.940 

the<00:03:30.860> dynamic<00:03:31.460> is<00:03:31.640> limited<00:03:32.390> a<00:03:32.690> very<00:03:33.110> low-end

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
the dynamic is limited a very low-end

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.970 
the dynamic is limited a very low-end
scut<00:03:34.400> so<00:03:35.270> if<00:03:35.510> you<00:03:35.690> don't<00:03:36.020> pull<00:03:36.410> the<00:03:36.440> bellows

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
scut so if you don't pull the bellows

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.670 
scut so if you don't pull the bellows
you<00:03:37.640> will<00:03:37.880> hear<00:03:38.090> anyway<00:03:38.690> all<00:03:38.990> playing<00:03:39.320> notes

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
you will hear anyway all playing notes

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.220 
you will hear anyway all playing notes

on the keyboard in met supporter of
course<00:03:43.040> that<00:03:43.310> is<00:03:43.490> not<00:03:43.520> naturally<00:03:44.420> but<00:03:45.020> you

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
course that is not naturally but you

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.320 
course that is not naturally but you
don't<00:03:45.530> have<00:03:45.800> to<00:03:46.040> have<00:03:46.250> the<00:03:46.490> accordion<00:03:46.940> always

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
don't have to have the accordion always

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.470 
don't have to have the accordion always
on<00:03:47.510> your<00:03:47.690> lap<00:03:48.130> also<00:03:49.130> on<00:03:49.400> the<00:03:49.910> lower<00:03:50.150> dynamic

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
on your lap also on the lower dynamic

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.050 
on your lap also on the lower dynamic
and<00:03:51.080> the<00:03:51.230> resolution<00:03:51.950> is<00:03:52.040> a<00:03:52.100> difficulty<00:03:52.880> for

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
and the resolution is a difficulty for

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.230 
and the resolution is a difficulty for
all<00:03:53.360> libraries<00:03:54.010> so<00:03:55.010> a<00:03:55.040> renounce<00:03:55.610> that<00:03:55.790> range

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:56.240 
all libraries so a renounce that range

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.330 
all libraries so a renounce that range
because<00:03:56.750> that<00:03:56.960> is<00:03:57.110> only<00:03:57.320> for<00:03:57.620> highly<00:03:57.980> artistic

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
because that is only for highly artistic

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.560 
because that is only for highly artistic
play<00:03:58.990> in<00:04:00.430> contact<00:04:01.430> you<00:04:01.670> can<00:04:01.850> set<00:04:02.210> the<00:04:02.390> volume

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
play in contact you can set the volume

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.260 
play in contact you can set the volume
panning<00:04:03.290> and<00:04:03.650> so<00:04:03.860> on<00:04:03.980> for<00:04:04.700> left<00:04:05.000> and<00:04:05.180> right

panning and so on for left and right
separately<00:04:06.310> the<00:04:07.310> samples<00:04:07.730> are<00:04:07.850> all<00:04:08.060> looped<00:04:08.480> so

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.020 
separately the samples are all looped so

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.000 
separately the samples are all looped so
you<00:04:09.080> can<00:04:09.440> alter<00:04:09.680> them<00:04:10.250> hold<00:04:10.640> it<00:04:10.790> without<00:04:10.940> a<00:04:11.210> net

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
you can alter them hold it without a net

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.670 
you can alter them hold it without a net
