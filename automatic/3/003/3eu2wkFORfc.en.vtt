00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
the clear modem and honestly they would

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.320 
the clear modem and honestly they would
do<00:01:14.550> just<00:01:14.850> fine

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
for about an hour and then they'd drop a

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.430 
for about an hour and then they'd drop a
connection<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.480> I'd<00:01:18.600> have<00:01:18.810> bad<00:01:19.050> internet

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
connection and I'd have bad internet

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.650 
connection and I'd have bad internet
about<00:01:19.950> 10<00:01:20.220> minutes<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.880> then<00:01:21.030> they<00:01:21.510> would

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:21.660 
about 10 minutes and then they would

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.950 
about 10 minutes and then they would
start<00:01:21.870> up<00:01:22.020> again<00:01:22.220> so<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.940> be<00:01:24.090> very<00:01:24.360> honest<00:01:24.810> the

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
start up again so to be very honest the

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.730 
start up again so to be very honest the
only<00:01:25.520> reliable<00:01:26.520> 802<00:01:27.510> 11<00:01:27.660> n<00:01:28.140> router<00:01:28.380> I

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
only reliable 802 11 n router I

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.820 
only reliable 802 11 n router I
personally<00:01:29.640> could<00:01:29.790> find<00:01:30.260> was<00:01:31.260> an<00:01:31.380> airport

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
personally could find was an airport

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.700 
personally could find was an airport
Xtreme<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.550> I<00:01:32.610> don't<00:01:32.670> know<00:01:32.940> why<00:01:33.120> people<00:01:33.750> use

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
Xtreme and I don't know why people use

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.280 
Xtreme and I don't know why people use
those<00:01:34.980> others<00:01:35.430> unless<00:01:36.030> they<00:01:36.720> experience

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
those others unless they experience

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.960 
those others unless they experience
outages<00:01:38.010> and<00:01:38.370> don't<00:01:38.640> know<00:01:38.850> don't<00:01:39.420> care<00:01:40.010> but<00:01:41.010> my

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
outages and don't know don't care but my

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.940 
outages and don't know don't care but my
wife<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.480> are<00:01:42.720> very<00:01:42.750> discriminating

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
wife and I are very discriminating

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.280 
wife and I are very discriminating
and<00:01:44.220> so<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.940> airport<00:01:45.210> extreme<00:01:45.600> was<00:01:45.870> the<00:01:46.140> only

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
and so the airport extreme was the only

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.790 
and so the airport extreme was the only
router<00:01:46.620> that<00:01:46.980> would<00:01:47.430> work<00:01:47.580> reliably<00:01:48.440> and<00:01:49.440> we

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
router that would work reliably and we

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.640 
router that would work reliably and we
don't<00:01:50.040> feel<00:01:50.340> like<00:01:50.550> we're<00:01:50.760> Apple<00:01:51.409> bigots<00:01:52.409> or

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
don't feel like we're Apple bigots or

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.910 
don't feel like we're Apple bigots or
fanboys<00:01:53.250> whatever<00:01:53.730> going<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:53.940> call<00:01:54.150> them<00:01:54.300> but

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
fanboys whatever going to call them but

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.410 
fanboys whatever going to call them but
that's<00:01:55.920> what<00:01:56.100> we<00:01:56.220> used<00:01:57.470> now<00:01:58.470> we<00:01:58.560> have<00:01:59.420> Wireless

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420

and<00:02:23.850> then<00:02:24.030> that<00:02:24.330> SD<00:02:24.720> card<00:02:25.020> is<00:02:25.230> shared<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:25.950> so

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
and then that SD card is shared and so

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.270 
and then that SD card is shared and so
we<00:02:27.060> can<00:02:27.209> do<00:02:27.330> quite<00:02:27.570> a<00:02:27.630> lot<00:02:27.750> with<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:28.170> it's<00:02:29.160> a

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
we can do quite a lot with it it's a

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.400 
we can do quite a lot with it it's a
wonderful<00:02:29.760> little<00:02:30.000> printer<00:02:30.360> and<00:02:30.540> I've<00:02:31.050> had<00:02:31.230> it

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
wonderful little printer and I've had it

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.980 
wonderful little printer and I've had it
for<00:02:31.590> a<00:02:31.620> couple<00:02:31.740> years<00:02:31.950> it's<00:02:32.550> a<00:02:32.640> work<00:02:32.820> for<00:02:33.120> 600<00:02:33.780> I

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
for a couple years it's a work for 600 I

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.870 
for a couple years it's a work for 600 I
don't<00:02:34.680> think<00:02:34.800> you<00:02:34.920> can<00:02:35.040> get<00:02:35.130> it<00:02:35.280> anymore<00:02:35.490> but

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
don't think you can get it anymore but

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:42.220 
don't think you can get it anymore but
you<00:02:36.060> can<00:02:36.240> get<00:02:36.650> new<00:02:37.650> versions<00:02:38.160> like<00:02:38.340> a<00:02:38.370> 635<00:02:39.830> and

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
you can get new versions like a 635 and

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.840 
you can get new versions like a 635 and
then<00:02:43.230> we<00:02:43.410> decided<00:02:44.070> to<00:02:44.220> do<00:02:44.400> something<00:02:44.670> a<00:02:44.760> little

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
then we decided to do something a little

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.520 
then we decided to do something a little
bit<00:02:45.090> different<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:45.630> this<00:02:45.750> is<00:02:45.930> probably<00:02:46.380> the

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
bit different and this is probably the

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.070 
bit different and this is probably the
most<00:02:46.680> innovative<00:02:47.300> thing<00:02:48.300> in<00:02:48.690> this

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
most innovative thing in this

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.590 
most innovative thing in this
presentation<00:02:49.739> is<00:02:50.310> we<00:02:50.790> purchased<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.360> Mac

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
presentation is we purchased the Mac

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.259 
presentation is we purchased the Mac
Mini<00:02:52.580> because<00:02:53.580> we<00:02:53.700> have<00:02:53.790> a<00:02:53.820> wireless<00:02:54.060> network

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
Mini because we have a wireless network

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.840 
Mini because we have a wireless network
and<00:02:54.989> we<00:02:55.470> thought<00:02:55.769> we<00:02:55.950> need<00:02:56.160> to<00:02:56.250> get<00:02:56.640> one<00:02:56.820> more

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
and we thought we need to get one more

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.770 
and we thought we need to get one more
computer<00:02:57.450> like<00:02:57.600> a<00:02:57.630> server<00:02:57.930> for<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.350> house<00:02:58.530> and

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
computer like a server for the house and

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.570 
computer like a server for the house and
the<00:03:00.780> interesting<00:03:01.290> part<00:03:01.320> is<00:03:01.860> where<00:03:02.100> we<00:03:02.250> placed

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
the interesting part is where we placed

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.380 
the interesting part is where we placed
it<00:03:02.940> we<00:03:03.540> placed<00:03:03.930> it<00:03:04.230> in<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.830> TV<00:03:05.310> cabinet<00:03:05.640> so

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
it we placed it in the TV cabinet so

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.080 
it we placed it in the TV cabinet so
that's<00:03:07.019> why<00:03:07.230> on<00:03:07.440> this<00:03:07.650> diagram<00:03:07.980> I've<00:03:08.489> located

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
that's why on this diagram I've located

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.870 
that's why on this diagram I've located
next<00:03:09.390> to<00:03:09.630> our<00:03:10.350> large<00:03:10.709> TV<00:03:11.190> with<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.550> surround

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
next to our large TV with the surround

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.560 
next to our large TV with the surround
sound<00:03:11.970> and<00:03:12.769> it<00:03:13.769> turns<00:03:14.010> out<00:03:14.250> you<00:03:15.030> can<00:03:15.239> just<00:03:15.450> hook

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
sound and it turns out you can just hook

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.960 
sound and it turns out you can just hook
an<00:03:15.750> HDMI<00:03:16.320> cable<00:03:16.350> from<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.100> Mac<00:03:17.280> Mini<00:03:17.310> to<00:03:17.850> the

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
an HDMI cable from the Mac Mini to the

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.130 
an HDMI cable from the Mac Mini to the
TV<00:03:19.400> and<00:03:20.400> then<00:03:20.820> you<00:03:20.970> could<00:03:21.150> connect<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.630> audio

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
TV and then you could connect the audio

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.420 
TV and then you could connect the audio
from<00:03:22.590> your<00:03:22.680> Mac<00:03:23.070> Mini<00:03:23.720> to<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:25.590> audio<00:03:26.070> on<00:03:26.370> your

purchased<00:04:41.780> a<00:04:41.900> bluetooth<00:04:42.410> mouse<00:04:42.680> Bluetooth

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
purchased a bluetooth mouse Bluetooth

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.700 
purchased a bluetooth mouse Bluetooth
keyboard<00:04:43.970> and<00:04:44.270> Mac<00:04:44.720> Mini<00:04:45.020> of<00:04:45.140> course<00:04:45.410> has

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
keyboard and Mac Mini of course has

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.280 
keyboard and Mac Mini of course has
bluetooth<00:04:46.340> just<00:04:46.610> built<00:04:46.850> in<00:04:47.090> and<00:04:47.420> so<00:04:48.110> that's

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
bluetooth just built in and so that's

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.880 
bluetooth just built in and so that's
how<00:04:48.620> we<00:04:48.650> control<00:04:49.310> the<00:04:49.850> unit<00:04:50.210> and<00:04:50.660> I<00:04:51.440> guess<00:04:51.650> to<00:04:51.860> a

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
how we control the unit and I guess to a

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.460 
how we control the unit and I guess to a
degree<00:04:52.010> we<00:04:52.430> always<00:04:52.880> are<00:04:53.060> looking<00:04:53.270> for<00:04:53.660> the<00:04:53.930> the

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
degree we always are looking for the the

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:55.960 
degree we always are looking for the the
keyboard<00:04:54.920> in<00:04:55.040> the<00:04:55.100> mouse<00:04:55.280> that's<00:04:55.610> spread

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
keyboard in the mouse that's spread

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.150 
keyboard in the mouse that's spread
around<00:04:56.090> the<00:04:56.420> room<00:04:56.930> just<00:04:57.620> like<00:04:57.770> you<00:04:57.920> would<00:04:58.130> any

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
around the room just like you would any

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.640 
around the room just like you would any
remote<00:04:58.670> so<00:04:59.180> that's<00:04:59.390> how<00:04:59.600> we<00:04:59.660> deal<00:05:00.320> with<00:05:00.350> the

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
remote so that's how we deal with the

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.650 
remote so that's how we deal with the
entertainment<00:05:00.860> cabinet<00:05:04.090> then<00:05:05.090> the<00:05:05.240> next<00:05:05.510> most

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
entertainment cabinet then the next most

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.230 
entertainment cabinet then the next most
interesting<00:05:06.230> thing<00:05:06.470> we<00:05:06.620> did<00:05:06.860> is<00:05:07.490> we<00:05:07.850> took<00:05:08.060> the

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
interesting thing we did is we took the
