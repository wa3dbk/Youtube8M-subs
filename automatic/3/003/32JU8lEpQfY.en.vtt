00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.569
 good morning this is amazing beauty 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.460
 plants hydrangea can grow in medium 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.400
 strip Russia only on the window 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.860
 what kind of hydrangea makes sense 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.650
 start up at home they ask me endlessly 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.439
 questions about hydrangeas like this 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.080
 beautifully painted white and a little bit in 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.840
 yellowness and this lilac 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.750
 red and blue attention 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.660
 flower growers are attracted to these 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.180
 hydrangea Hydrangea grandiflora is surely 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.309
 large-flowered hydrangea 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.340
 the plant can acquire this pride and 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.379
 keep as a houseplant 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.719
 long enough but so abundant 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.149
 to achieve flowering in indoor conditions 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.120
 where we have with you the lighting is not very 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.850
 good and winter day is rather short 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.570
 it is difficult therefore even if in a plant 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.260
 save 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.420
 it is better to take it outside for the summer 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.449
 give flower buds 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.359
 just so where are these varieties impossible 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.000
 growing outside is extremely 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.770
 problematic and the thing is not that 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.590
 plants can not winter 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.340
 could also be cut off like a rose 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.310
 cover him say a bucket of sand and she 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.430
 calm our winters are not very 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.770
 simple snowy winters plant in medium 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.680
 strip of Russia and more northern areas 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.170
 does not have time to bloom 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.659
 evolve victories that's why these plants 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.700
 we unfortunately can not plant in our 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.340
 garden and can not pursue such 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.729
 results of how flower growers are clogged 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.670
 in the south there are not very powerful bushes which 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.590
 covered with hats colors tends 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.479
 also change color during your 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.880
 blooms that is starting to bloom 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.579
 for example pink and finish your 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.579
 bloom blue which is of course very 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.189
 unusual and interesting in the northern areas 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.030
 we cannot achieve such a flowering 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.509
 winter lice and 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.299
 plant until the shoot shoots while on 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.180
 they are formed flower buds and already here 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.399
 and autumn and flowering is weak 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.720
 nondescript and absolutely not 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:15.150
 bodily and if one of you wants 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.909
 still enjoy this wonderful 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.150
 the plant and its flowering should be taken 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:24.540
 his house after all tune in to 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.700
 that this plant will be sap long 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.109
 worth the bouquet in the future 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.790
 count on what's in the room 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:30.359
 conditions they will be so lush and 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.239
 beautiful 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:37.700
 does not come and what is required here 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:40.709
 hydrangeas i recommend moderate watering and 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.450
 Of course, to ensure that no series 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.120
 no pests because it is there 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.849
 the pests sit down then they spoil not 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.859
 only the leaves of this plant but also the flowers 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.760
 you can experiment of course 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:55.769
 and plant it in the garden by my experience and 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.980
 many other fibers do not 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:01.790
 goodbye to you 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.790
 Have a good mood
