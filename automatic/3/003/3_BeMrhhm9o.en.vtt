these are tall trees tell me the process

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.229 
these are tall trees tell me the process
of<00:00:33.140> harvesting<00:00:33.290> and<00:00:33.830> how<00:00:33.920> that<00:00:34.100> happens<00:00:34.579> well

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
of harvesting and how that happens well

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.990 
of harvesting and how that happens well
we'll<00:00:35.450> start<00:00:35.780> off<00:00:36.039> being<00:00:37.039> patient<00:00:37.370> with

we'll start off being patient with
Mother<00:00:38.600> Nature<00:00:38.690> kind<00:00:39.170> of<00:00:39.260> looking<00:00:39.500> at<00:00:39.649> the

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
Mother Nature kind of looking at the

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.389 
Mother Nature kind of looking at the
forecast<00:00:40.210> we'll<00:00:41.210> let<00:00:41.510> the<00:00:41.840> the<00:00:42.649> nuts<00:00:42.890> fall<00:00:43.190> and

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
forecast we'll let the the nuts fall and

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:45.700 
forecast we'll let the the nuts fall and
we<00:00:43.460> try<00:00:43.640> to<00:00:43.699> get<00:00:43.879> as<00:00:43.969> many<00:00:44.570> nuts<00:00:44.930> on<00:00:45.110> the<00:00:45.350> ground

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
we try to get as many nuts on the ground

we try to get as many nuts on the ground
that<00:00:46.219> first<00:00:46.610> pick<00:00:47.420> and<00:00:47.660> so<00:00:48.230> patience<00:00:49.039> is<00:00:49.250> key

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
then into a cart or a tote hmm well what

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.969 
then into a cart or a tote hmm well what
I<00:01:50.090> found<00:01:50.270> interesting<00:01:50.509> was<00:01:50.990> this<00:01:51.170> actually<00:01:51.740> is

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
I found interesting was this actually is

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.399 
I found interesting was this actually is
what<00:01:52.460> they<00:01:52.579> are<00:01:52.610> like<00:01:52.850> on<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:53.450> tree<00:01:53.750> and<00:01:54.079> I

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
what they are like on the tree and I

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:55.840 
what they are like on the tree and I
made<00:01:54.649> the<00:01:54.740> assumption<00:01:55.040> this<00:01:55.310> was<00:01:55.520> what<00:01:55.729> would

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
made the assumption this was what would

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.399 
made the assumption this was what would
fall<00:01:56.030> to<00:01:56.060> the<00:01:56.240> ground<00:01:56.299> but<00:01:56.840> that's<00:01:57.110> inaccurate

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
fall to the ground but that's inaccurate

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.709 
fall to the ground but that's inaccurate
isn't<00:01:57.890> it<00:01:57.979> knows<00:01:58.219> this<00:01:58.820> is<00:01:59.060> how<00:01:59.180> they<00:01:59.329> fall<00:01:59.539> out

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
isn't it knows this is how they fall out

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:01.480 
isn't it knows this is how they fall out
that's<00:01:59.990> how<00:02:00.170> they<00:02:00.320> fall<00:02:00.500> out<00:02:00.680> these<00:02:01.070> are<00:02:01.280> ready

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
that's how they fall out these are ready

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.850 
that's how they fall out these are ready
then<00:02:01.850> to<00:02:02.090> go<00:02:02.240> into<00:02:02.630> the<00:02:02.750> processing<00:02:03.350> stage<00:02:03.590> so

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
then to go into the processing stage so

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.319 
then to go into the processing stage so
why<00:02:03.979> don't<00:02:04.159> we<00:02:04.250> take<00:02:04.579> a<00:02:04.640> look<00:02:04.850> at<00:02:05.000> that<00:02:05.090> area

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
why don't we take a look at that area

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.010 
why don't we take a look at that area
and<00:02:05.539> show<00:02:06.079> me<00:02:06.200> what's<00:02:06.380> going<00:02:06.560> on<00:02:06.619> the<00:02:06.770> perfect

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
and show me what's going on the perfect

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.750 
and show me what's going on the perfect
so<00:02:09.020> I<00:02:09.320> guess<00:02:09.770> this<00:02:10.100> is<00:02:10.160> what<00:02:10.490> you<00:02:10.610> would<00:02:10.700> call

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
so I guess this is what you would call

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.820 
so I guess this is what you would call
the<00:02:10.970> processing<00:02:11.930> plant<00:02:12.230> part<00:02:12.560> of<00:02:12.680> it<00:02:12.770> huh<00:02:12.920> yes

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
the processing plant part of it huh yes

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.620 
the processing plant part of it huh yes
happens<00:02:14.160> here<00:02:14.370> then<00:02:14.580> a<00:02:14.730> lot<00:02:14.910> of<00:02:14.940> noise<00:02:15.180> yeah<00:02:15.510> it

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
happens here then a lot of noise yeah it

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.240 
happens here then a lot of noise yeah it
is<00:02:15.920> so<00:02:16.920> it<00:02:17.850> starts<00:02:18.180> off<00:02:18.360> with<00:02:18.920> now<00:02:19.920> we've<00:02:20.100> taken

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
is so it starts off with now we've taken

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.130 
is so it starts off with now we've taken
the<00:02:20.550> nuts<00:02:20.760> out<00:02:20.910> of<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.120> field<00:02:21.360> in<00:02:21.570> a<00:02:21.660> tote<00:02:21.900> and

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
the nuts out of the field in a tote and

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.020 
the nuts out of the field in a tote and
we<00:02:23.130> dump<00:02:23.520> them<00:02:23.670> into<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.120> system<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:26.030> they'll

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
we dump them into the system and they'll

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.950 
we dump them into the system and they'll
start<00:02:27.720> sorting<00:02:28.140> out<00:02:28.260> sticks<00:02:28.650> egg<00:02:29.160> debris<00:02:29.580> and

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
start sorting out sticks egg debris and

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.960 
start sorting out sticks egg debris and
then<00:02:30.960> they'll<00:02:31.170> go<00:02:31.320> through<00:02:31.350> a<00:02:31.650> round<00:02:32.100> cylinder

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
then they'll go through a round cylinder

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.570 
then they'll go through a round cylinder
which<00:02:33.600> will<00:02:33.780> get<00:02:33.930> rid<00:02:34.410> of<00:02:34.440> a<00:02:34.800> lot<00:02:35.040> of<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.310> dirt

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
which will get rid of a lot of the dirt

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.880 
which will get rid of a lot of the dirt
and<00:02:35.880> that<00:02:35.910> sorts<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.050> nuts<00:02:37.290> from<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.620> dirt

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
and that sorts the nuts from the dirt

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.820 
and that sorts the nuts from the dirt
right<00:02:38.250> there<00:02:38.520> and<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:39.420> nuts<00:02:39.660> will<00:02:40.560> drop

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
right there and the nuts will drop

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.950 
right there and the nuts will drop
through<00:02:41.100> some<00:02:41.310> holes<00:02:41.550> and<00:02:41.880> then<00:02:42.450> go<00:02:42.660> through<00:02:42.930> a

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
through some holes and then go through a

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.610 
through some holes and then go through a
series<00:02:43.290> of<00:02:43.440> chain<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:44.600> conveyors<00:02:45.600> to<00:02:46.230> get<00:02:46.410> rid

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
series of chain and conveyors to get rid

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.780 
series of chain and conveyors to get rid
of<00:02:46.650> more<00:02:47.040> dirt<00:02:47.400> and<00:02:47.670> sticks<00:02:48.510> and<00:02:48.950> then<00:02:49.950> an<00:02:50.310> air

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
of more dirt and sticks and then an air

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.330 
of more dirt and sticks and then an air
leg<00:02:51.030> which<00:02:51.420> will<00:02:51.570> suck<00:02:51.810> off<00:02:52.020> leads<00:02:52.860> and

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
leg which will suck off leads and

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.990 
leg which will suck off leads and
anything<00:02:53.910> light<00:02:54.180> that<00:02:54.780> is<00:02:54.990> is<00:02:55.709> out<00:02:56.010> there<00:02:56.310> then

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
anything light that is is out there then

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.449 
anything light that is is out there then
that<00:02:57.240> will<00:02:57.420> go<00:02:57.600> into<00:02:57.990> a<00:02:58.290> wash<00:02:58.680> barrel<00:02:59.100> and

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
that will go into a wash barrel and

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:00.920 
that will go into a wash barrel and
they'll<00:02:59.610> get<00:02:59.730> washed<00:03:00.000> so<00:03:00.360> that's<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.690> first

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
they'll get washed so that's the first

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.480 
they'll get washed so that's the first
time<00:03:01.140> they've<00:03:01.320> seen<00:03:01.560> any<00:03:01.740> kind<00:03:01.950> of<00:03:02.100> water

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
time they've seen any kind of water
