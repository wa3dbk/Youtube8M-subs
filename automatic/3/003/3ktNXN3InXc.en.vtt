00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
had applied concealer but you could

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.810 
had applied concealer but you could
still<00:01:46.500> see<00:01:46.829> them<00:01:47.040> so<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.250> wanted<00:01:47.610> something

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
still see them so I wanted something

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.160 
still see them so I wanted something
that<00:01:47.970> would<00:01:48.119> reflect<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.720> light<00:01:48.930> in<00:01:49.079> the

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
that would reflect the light in the

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.830 
that would reflect the light in the
pictures<00:01:49.500> but<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:50.220> kind<00:01:50.549> of<00:01:50.610> overdid<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.600> it

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
pictures but I kind of overdid it and it

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.539 
pictures but I kind of overdid it and it
looks<00:01:52.020> like<00:01:52.110> she<00:01:52.350> has<00:01:52.439> cocaine<00:01:52.890> underneath

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
looks like she has cocaine underneath

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.340 
looks like she has cocaine underneath
her<00:01:53.670> eyes<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.270> almost<00:01:54.570> all<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.960> pictures

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
her eyes and almost all the pictures

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:03.870 
her eyes and almost all the pictures
which<00:01:55.649> is<00:01:55.829> horrible

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.210 

so<00:02:04.479> this<00:02:04.869> is<00:02:05.049> a<00:02:05.080> powder<00:02:05.320> that<00:02:05.439> does<00:02:05.920> bring

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
so this is a powder that does bring

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.219 
so this is a powder that does bring
whiteness<00:02:06.759> brings<00:02:07.210> lightness<00:02:07.869> underneath

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
whiteness brings lightness underneath

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.980 
whiteness brings lightness underneath
your<00:02:08.350> eye<00:02:08.410> but<00:02:09.190> you<00:02:09.399> just<00:02:09.880> need<00:02:10.209> to<00:02:10.420> use<00:02:10.600> the

slightest<00:02:11.830> littlest<00:02:12.520> amount<00:02:12.700> of<00:02:13.270> this

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
slightest littlest amount of this

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.990 
slightest littlest amount of this
definitely<00:02:14.319> make<00:02:14.530> sure<00:02:14.560> that<00:02:14.800> you<00:02:15.100> just<00:02:15.430> you
