00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.580
 born of a group of medical friends 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.350
 nutritionists 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.869
 distinguish the wellness sector from the 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:21.320
 Sports Health is just to try 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:23.810
 to provide information through 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.410
 own events like this through the 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.660
 site is called girona 2005 punto org 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.330
 on nutrition and wellness to health 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.640
 sports performance but free from 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.309
 commercial interests connected in 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.750
 effects being the president already since 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.260
 first mandate of this association 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.930
 I am very honored to be part of a 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.629
 group of people that everything is 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.030
 professed and says born of ours 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.879
 experiences of our studies from ours 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:56.750
 beliefs and no one can own 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:58.369
 of the commercial advantages with 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.989
 any company that deals with 

00:00:58.369 --> 00:01:03.019
 wellness health sport 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.239
 therefore of food supplements and drugs 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:08.030
 also products for the practice 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.549
 sporty in this way anyone does 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.570
 will address us understand that we seek to 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:19.940
 give information for the welfare of 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:23.350
 people and clear and available without without 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.350
 no false end 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.690
 are behind the fashion of the various types ne 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.640
 we have 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.440
 spoken from the diet in these bleeds 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.630
 from the greater son come sonora Ã¨ 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.630
 hunted today are the extremes like 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.860
 we have seen high-protein diets 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.710
 typological also that which is crazy 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.330
 in the last few years he is still using 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.210
 from the incredible devastation a year 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.850
 studio I see two or three people at 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.290
 week I call them veterans from 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.090
 radu cana once we doctors 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.580
 we have an idea now says 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.250
 unbalanced raducan unbalanced diets 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.140
 etc. and on the other side there is another 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.450
 diet from which it was treated 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.280
 in the morning which is becoming moves 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.470
 in Italy he was in the united states up 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.210
 a few years ago the vegan diet that 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.000
 also starting from some assumptions 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.490
 other ethics that I don't want 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.010
 discussing here has become one 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.630
 equally unbalanced fashionable diet 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.910
 how can you say the dukan diet in the 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.520
 opposite sense that is, man is not made of 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.770
 eat eat only fatty protein 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.260
 as pierre dukan says, he doesn't either 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.850
 made and to eat only foods from 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.280
 vegetable origin because we are not 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.400
 herbivores is in the midst of these two there 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.400
 an omnivorous diet where vegetables are 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.530
 a basic part just like the ball 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.570
 area was same area where there is a 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.930
 adequate amount of protein 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.489
 animals as healthy as possible 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.739
 fat integration and the whole 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.750
 all the rest remain from the spices 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.000
 feed this is what it always has 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.520
 ate the man when he was healthy when 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.300
 I started to unbalance in one sense 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.160
 or the other 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.650
 and this happened as we saw in 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.940
 these two days even after the advent 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.040
 farming are farming 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.010
 trouble appeared on health than not 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.019
 they existed before and now let us give the 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.320
 being of the healthy longevity 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.320
 of people 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.480
 the scientific study more 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.819
 in history the longest range that 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.980
 exists and humanity if proteins 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.049
 animals actually caused i 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.060
 damage that is described by cancer 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.370
 heart attack and other problems 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.290
 we would already be extinct because humanity for 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.049
 2 and a half million have at least ha 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.780
 consumed animal protein without trouble i 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:41.549
 problems when these people do that 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.370
 live in nature they go fishing hunting 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:46.349
 and harvest vegetables go to 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.420
 cities begin to consume so of the 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.670
 New ones appear in trouble 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.940
 not by chance if we go to see 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.890
 still populations like the Eskimos 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.450
 masai etc. also consume another 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.310
 quantity of sausages from them 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.590
 heart attack cancer in practice 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.890
 for example, cancer, for example 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.379
 strikes the south india falcidia where 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.510
 they are notoriously Hindu vegetarians where 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:12.260
 they have one of the most life expectancies 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.260
 court to the world 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:22.900
 yes yes because with good faith 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.870
 commercial that generates a grandmother who 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.720
 lead to eating perhaps convinced foods 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.570
 that we do ourselves good for it is 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:35.050
 example cites some studies on the fact 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:37.030
 that the vegetarian diet is good 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.130
 I refer in particular to vegan 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.950
 which as we know in recent times 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:44.290
 is taking many employees even though a 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.120
 still today and were 08 percent of the 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.160
 population therefore we start with numbers 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.560
 unfortunately they are very aggressive unfortunately 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.240
 they also become intransigent and with 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.530
 others who have different choices if me 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.510
 I see one who chooses not to eat 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.820
 canine animal protein and returning 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.860
 on the plate despite being of the trade 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.780
 these allow themselves to say that one who 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.030
 eat the slice of meat maybe it is 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.340
 eating a corpse and looking at you 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.470
 shields we are coming extremisms that 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.020
 many in the united states that professed 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.390
 as I said this fashion years ago you are 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.130
 read again by university professors from 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.350
 convinced vegans have done 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.940
 Books publications did not explain that 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.080
 apologized for this error in 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.210
 good faith 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.060
 now we are living this with us 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:27.700
 cancan etc I would like to go back a little 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:30.340
 to the facts and just a few months 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:33.880
 in fact, a few months ago, it came out 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:36.240
 an interesting study published by 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:39.670
 graz university in austria where they have 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:42.070
 compares the health charges and 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:45.010
 on the choices is vegetarian and vegan e 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.390
 carnivores and an eagle and it emerged that the 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.760
 people on a diet 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:51.460
 vegetarian have 50 percent more 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:54.430
 of cancer 50 percent more infarction 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:57.340
 of allergy of sphere disorders 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:59.290
 mental including one thing is 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.860
 particularly significant the 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:04.900
 vegetarians in general are about others 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.280
 3.4 percent of the population but 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.750
 those with disorders 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.400
 of attention and is behavior 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.830
 feed 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.290
 50 percent are accepted 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:16.690
 vegetarians obviously are not healthy 

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:19.900
 balanced in fact returning to nature 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:21.340
 no population exists 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.259
 historically that I could 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:26.320
 survive on a diet 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:29.020
 exclusively vegetarian meat the 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:31.539
 better meat and fish proteins 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:34.060
 the fish of the meat are those that there 

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:36.100
 they allowed the evolution I did 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.900
 also an anthropology thesis for one 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.560
 graduation a few years ago right on this one 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.509
 evolution 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.400
 man has become man is no longer 

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:44.530
 monkey since inserted letters 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.970
 animals in the diet and you can come back 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.220
 back there are searches 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:50.650
 of Oxford University testify 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.780
 that if the human being remove proteins 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:55.630
 animals like can be vegetarian 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:58.090
 vegans six times more loss of matter 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.630
 gray compared to a cloud in the house 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.340
 our 

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:02.260
 I my wife my children we eat 

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:05.229
 so now for 17 years 

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:07.090
 we consume about 7 kg a day of 

00:07:05.229 --> 00:07:09.460
 fruit and vegetables which is our base 

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:12.400
 but we eat the right amount 

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:14.770
 of lean meat sometimes even red not 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.720
 only white will think of some eggs for 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.949
 cover the demand until proven 

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.740
 contrary from the scientific point of view 

00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:23.440
 and doctor is the ideal petrol for the 

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:27.780
 human body for this fat verini 

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.780
 answers with work just as much thanks
