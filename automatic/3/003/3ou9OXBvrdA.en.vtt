 for tasteful pixi books down there dr 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.930
 although she is already 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.930
 the cultural site Burlo 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.650
 "Where is it so high 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.650
 that this job is not affected like this but leisurely shopping 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.170
 but to keep up with Forbo 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.660
 the euro fell 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.180
 for example the game here 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.180
 what is on it 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.900
 Dense smoke evening 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.290
 smoking in watering 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.650

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.580
 When I get my Lisicki will us in this profession 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.190
 honored for her role in the Blind Side 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.190
 It is also a form of being on the river 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.440
 always liked to be heard 

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:12.159
 to play on 

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:22.769
 as well as in this one for you 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.769
 so can come 

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:39.179
 Saskatoon it is sad 

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:52.769
 the interest in 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.439
 the authors 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:57.439
 Wahab Gashi 

00:02:58.429 --> 00:03:01.429
 tasty 2 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:06.309
 I would also like to point out to give 

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:08.049
 on each one of these 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.049
 Terrain off 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.689
 Meral bacteria and fungi are present as in many a Petri dish 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:17.789
 in the US Department of Defense 

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:21.049
 this station there survive all day trip because it is important here 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:22.329
 Culture against

 projects are being promoted, he says 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.139
 Very important is also still uncertain for the overall impression one to ask who 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:32.489
 is excellent 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:33.909
 also the cobwebs 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:36.679
 one can assume that 

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:38.579
 just so can the proverbial 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.650
 not even cleaned in the last 25 years 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.339
 that's right 

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:46.629
 the biting stink is so far from Ulrich Thien
