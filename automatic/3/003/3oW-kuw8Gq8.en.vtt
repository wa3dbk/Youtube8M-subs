00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.920 
in that color and make it a little bit
more<00:01:55.450> intense<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:58.060> now<00:01:58.270> we're<00:01:58.420> going<00:01:58.570> to<00:01:58.660> kind

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
more intense so now we're going to kind

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.580 
more intense so now we're going to kind
of<00:01:59.080> mix<00:01:59.860> these<00:02:00.130> two<00:02:00.490> colors<00:02:00.760> and<00:02:01.300> this<00:02:02.290> one<00:02:02.500> has

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
of mix these two colors and this one has

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.210 
of mix these two colors and this one has
actually<00:02:02.740> makeup<00:02:03.190> forever<00:02:03.550> and<00:02:03.940> it<00:02:04.330> is<00:02:05.220> number

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
actually makeup forever and it is number

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.279 
actually makeup forever and it is number
one<00:02:06.760> to<00:02:07.090> seven<00:02:07.600> and<00:02:07.750> it's<00:02:07.869> this<00:02:07.990> kind<00:02:08.170> of

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
one to seven and it's this kind of

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.550 
one to seven and it's this kind of
taupey<00:02:08.770> brown<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.929> I<00:02:10.990> believe<00:02:11.320> this<00:02:11.440> is

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
taupey brown and I believe this is
