00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:05.440
 and after being with the strongest European group that is to say basic points and 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.509
 the third in the world we settled down to dispute the press conference of the 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:13.740
 brand bmw 1 p this brand 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.579
 is premiering an extraordinary concept within their plans 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:22.699
 and it should be noted that even with the global automotive crisis, it did not feel 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.699
 Quality unit such as the Detroit auto show 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.329
 so he showed in this car are German the brand bmw a 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:35.330
 literally mounting a track in ovals inside the stadium 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.220
 to show their cars in motion 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.359
 since now 

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:40.839
 the strategy is called 

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:43.060
 dynamic efficiency 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.350
 this strategy 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.160
 is aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.950
 and fuel consumption in addition to the electrical options 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.729
 and as part of the show the bm double an email my aunt of the 20s 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:07.350
 He delighted us with his sound to begin what it was to show his entire range 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.350
 with new engines 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.000
 citizenship 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.120
 two 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:27.160
 where the effective 320 stands out efe the car says the one that consumes only four 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.960
 points municipality without stealth meters gijÃ³n 11 109 grams of dioxide 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.020
 coal per kilometer 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.760
 for what dimensions a vv motor of cavilac pools that 388 grams of 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.320
 carbon dioxide per kilometer that is just like it was like I said that 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.710
 it was fine to have numerous records of the automotive industry 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.250
 and the other exhibited cars showed consumption data 13 4 points 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.850
 up to 7 liters per 100 kilometers 

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:12.089
 jijiji of his star releases 

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:14.159
 very little tourism 5 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:18.659
 it is a high contrast between 6 and 7 was conceptualized towards the 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:20.189
 interior space 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:22.659
 very cynical or unification 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:26.760
 It is a large four-seater paper with an interior configuration 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.089
 is oriented to compose 

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:34.449
 This area we already tested in Portugal soon we will have the report 

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:35.699
 palaces 

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:40.499
 but the most important thing that the brand presented because its self-concept flames do not 

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:45.979
 worked and if in Banamex this concept is developed under the strategy of 

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:47.579
 dynamic efficiency 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.839
 and it's really a stop of the future 

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:54.409
 that combine the maximum technology listorti electrical technology 

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:57.139
 one this is football 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:01.199
 the future is marked by the development of new materials technologies 

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:03.239
 lightweight high strength 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.919
 that allow existing shapes and light assemblies through glue 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:12.779
 this highly aerodynamic car of only 0 point 

00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:14.709
 bush after 67 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.159
 is a 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:18.019
 in a production car 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.739
 a warm mouth idol 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.739
 has five points 27 of seville 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:25.219
 your diesel engine 

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:28.579
 achieves the emission of carbon dioxide of 99 grams 

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:34.329
 and its acceleration from zero to one hundred kilometers per hour is 4 jun 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:40.669
 and the most surprising thing is that it consumes three points 7 liters per 100 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:44.939
 imagine a ferrari 

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:48.859
 every 100 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.859
 this is the future of automotive technology 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.429
 as you move there's still more of the Frankfurt autoshow 

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:59.059
 in the next program 

00:03:59.059 --> 00:04:02.469
 you can see the second part of the fault autoshow 

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:03.819
 so you know on the web 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.719
 the ferrari 458 

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:09.719
 the new love and nostalgia 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:15.889
 and many many more 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:20.129
 next weekend 

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.709
 is what we expect
