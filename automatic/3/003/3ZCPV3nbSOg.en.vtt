and the only person he could trust with

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.190 
and the only person he could trust with

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
the recipe who knew German was a friend

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.890 
the recipe who knew German was a friend
of<00:02:01.260> his<00:02:01.470> from<00:02:01.920> Peru<00:02:02.760> and<00:02:03.330> I<00:02:03.390> supportive<00:02:03.780> and

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
of his from Peru and I supportive and

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.350 
of his from Peru and I supportive and
gentleman<00:02:04.350> who<00:02:04.530> had<00:02:04.740> fled<00:02:05.610> his<00:02:05.940> country<00:02:06.330> of

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010 
origin due to the outbreak of

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.150 
origin due to the outbreak of
existentialism<00:02:08.880> there<00:02:09.270> so<00:02:09.960> the<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.830> recipe

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
existentialism there so the the recipe

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.840 
existentialism there so the the recipe
itself<00:02:11.520> was<00:02:11.810> translated<00:02:12.810> from<00:02:12.960> German

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
itself was translated from German

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.930 
itself was translated from German
through<00:02:14.850> Spanish<00:02:15.240> then<00:02:16.170> into<00:02:16.530> English<00:02:16.920> but<00:02:17.850> it

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
through Spanish then into English but it

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.370 
through Spanish then into English but it
didn't<00:02:18.180> lose<00:02:18.360> much<00:02:18.630> in<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.840> translation

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
didn't lose much in the translation

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.960 
didn't lose much in the translation
because<00:02:19.470> bread<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.130> cheese<00:02:20.430> tend<00:02:20.880> to

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
because bread and cheese tend to

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.730 
because bread and cheese tend to
translate<00:02:21.840> fairly<00:02:22.200> smoothly<00:02:23.930> so<00:02:24.930> I<00:02:24.959> decided

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
translate fairly smoothly so I decided

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.580 
translate fairly smoothly so I decided
to<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:26.940> walk<00:02:27.630> to<00:02:27.840> this<00:02:27.959> store<00:02:28.200> I've<00:02:28.380> always
