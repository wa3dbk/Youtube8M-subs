not<00:02:30.120> record<00:02:30.600> well<00:02:30.750> in<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:30.959> video<00:02:31.110> so<00:02:31.470> but<00:02:31.950> if

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
not record well in the video so but if

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.920 
not record well in the video so but if
you<00:02:32.130> want<00:02:32.310> to<00:02:32.400> layer<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.790> harpsichord<00:02:33.270> sound

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
you want to layer a harpsichord sound

you want to layer a harpsichord sound
with<00:02:34.530> your<00:02:34.560> electronic<00:02:35.370> keyboard<00:02:35.790> sound

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
with your electronic keyboard sound

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.760 
with your electronic keyboard sound
that's<00:02:36.690> that<00:02:37.020> will<00:02:37.170> give<00:02:37.350> them<00:02:37.440> that<00:02:37.470> kind<00:02:37.739> of

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
that's that will give them that kind of

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.410 
that's that will give them that kind of
air<00:02:38.010> that<00:02:38.190> little<00:02:38.370> crunch<00:02:38.610> for<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.239> power

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
air that little crunch for the power

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.240 
air that little crunch for the power
chords<00:02:39.840> on<00:02:39.959> the<00:02:39.989> guitar<00:02:40.080> on<00:02:40.590> it<00:02:43.100> alright<00:02:44.100> but

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
chords on the guitar on it alright but

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.560 
chords on the guitar on it alright but
I'm<00:02:44.340> just<00:02:44.430> gonna<00:02:44.610> leave<00:02:44.880> it<00:02:44.910> open<00:02:45.239> like<00:02:45.360> your

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
I'm just gonna leave it open like your

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.070 
I'm just gonna leave it open like your
keyboard<00:02:45.989> for<00:02:46.170> this<00:02:46.620> lesson<00:02:47.400> here<00:02:47.900> ok<00:02:48.900> let's

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
keyboard for this lesson here ok let's

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:56.780 
keyboard for this lesson here ok let's
look<00:02:49.170> at<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:49.410> right<00:02:49.590> hand<00:02:54.650> now<00:02:55.650> I<00:02:55.709> added<00:02:56.250> an<00:02:56.400> E

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
look at the right hand now I added an E

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.699 
look at the right hand now I added an E
flat<00:02:56.970> octave<00:02:57.569> here<00:02:57.750> instead<00:02:58.080> just<00:02:58.260> playing<00:02:58.590> a

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
flat octave here instead just playing a

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:04.430 
flat octave here instead just playing a
single<00:02:59.040> I<00:03:02.450> think<00:03:03.450> it<00:03:03.690> fills<00:03:03.900> it<00:03:04.050> out<00:03:04.200> if<00:03:04.290> it's

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
single I think it fills it out if it's

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.960 
single I think it fills it out if it's
too<00:03:04.560> difficult<00:03:04.709> for<00:03:05.040> you<00:03:05.280> leave<00:03:05.489> the<00:03:05.640> bottom

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
too difficult for you leave the bottom

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
and then up to G and up to C then now

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.360 
and then up to G and up to C then now
the<00:04:19.130> beat<00:04:19.489> down<00:04:20.209> to<00:04:20.420> a<00:04:20.600> flat<00:04:20.810> now<00:04:21.739> don't<00:04:22.250> play

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370

the beat down to a flat now don't play
the<00:04:22.610> parentheses<00:04:23.240> part<00:04:23.680> just<00:04:24.680> go<00:04:24.800> to<00:04:24.860> B<00:04:25.100> flat

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
the parentheses part just go to B flat

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.330 
the parentheses part just go to B flat
and<00:04:26.240> B<00:04:26.420> flat<00:04:26.450> again<00:04:27.100> then<00:04:28.100> you're<00:04:28.220> actually

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
and B flat again then you're actually

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:34.860 
and B flat again then you're actually
gonna<00:04:28.640> repeat<00:04:30.730> at<00:04:31.730> that<00:04:31.910> point<00:04:32.680> you<00:04:33.680> go<00:04:33.830> back

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
this again any flat now we're gonna do

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:57.060 
this again any flat now we're gonna do
this<00:04:44.900> stuff<00:04:45.020> in<00:04:45.290> parenthesis<00:04:45.790> okay<00:04:46.790> G<00:04:47.570> a<00:04:48.730> G

only play the stuff in parenthesis and
then<00:05:08.120> you<00:05:08.270> do<00:05:08.419> play<00:05:08.630> that<00:05:08.840> a<00:05:08.870> flat<00:05:09.260> there<00:05:09.590> you

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
then you do play that a flat there you

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.550 
then you do play that a flat there you
keep<00:05:10.070> going<00:05:10.430> okay<00:05:10.910> so<00:05:11.120> let's<00:05:11.510> go<00:05:11.660> slow<00:05:12.020> motion

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
keep going okay so let's go slow motion

keep going okay so let's go slow motion
for<00:05:12.770> you<00:05:12.830> very<00:05:13.490> beginning<00:05:13.940> here<00:05:14.060> we<00:05:14.090> go

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:36.569 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:44.210 

paralysis

the<00:05:58.450> same

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:12.710 

seven<00:06:05.680> times

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.120 

you<00:06:13.720> can't<00:06:14.020> really<00:06:14.139> hear<00:06:14.500> it<00:06:14.620> at<00:06:14.740> all<00:06:14.889> at<00:06:15.100> first

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.130 
you can't really hear it at all at first

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.250 
you can't really hear it at all at first
and<00:06:16.030> I'm<00:06:16.180> just<00:06:16.360> assuming<00:06:16.690> that's<00:06:17.080> what<00:06:17.139> the

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:17.260 
and I'm just assuming that's what the

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:18.689 
and I'm just assuming that's what the
keyboard<00:06:17.620> part<00:06:17.830> is<00:06:18.010> playing<00:06:18.280> because<00:06:18.550> the

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:18.699 
keyboard part is playing because the

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:21.719 
keyboard part is playing because the
other<00:06:18.850> instruments<00:06:19.120> are<00:06:19.360> so<00:06:19.510> loud<00:06:19.690> there<00:06:20.729> but

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:21.729 
other instruments are so loud there but

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:33.150 
other instruments are so loud there but
we'll<00:06:22.180> do<00:06:22.300> it<00:06:22.330> seven<00:06:22.660> times<00:06:30.960> eight<00:06:32.020> I<00:06:32.350> can't

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.160 
we'll do it seven times eight I can't

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.590 
we'll do it seven times eight I can't
evade<00:06:33.310> our<00:06:33.370> counted<00:06:33.850> beats<00:06:34.090> instead<00:06:34.479> of

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:34.600 
evade our counted beats instead of

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.480 
evade our counted beats instead of
counting<00:06:34.900> how<00:06:35.020> many<00:06:35.050> times<00:06:35.470> I<00:06:35.680> did<00:06:35.860> this<00:06:36.070> if

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:36.490 
counting how many times I did this if

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.939 
counting how many times I did this if
you<00:06:36.669> count<00:06:36.940> beats<00:06:37.210> it's<00:06:37.510> eight<00:06:37.720> beats<00:06:37.990> if<00:06:38.410> you

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:38.949 
you count beats it's eight beats if you

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:40.170 
you count beats it's eight beats if you
count<00:06:39.160> how<00:06:39.250> many<00:06:39.310> times<00:06:39.430> you<00:06:39.699> play<00:06:39.850> it<00:06:40.060> at

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:40.180 
count how many times you play it at

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:49.860 
count how many times you play it at
seven<00:06:41.010> so<00:06:42.010> if<00:06:42.250> you<00:06:42.370> count<00:06:42.520> beats<00:06:42.910> its<00:06:48.330> hey<00:06:49.360> and

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:49.870 
seven so if you count beats its hey and

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.050 
seven so if you count beats its hey and
then<00:06:49.990> there's<00:06:50.169> an<00:06:50.290> e-flat<00:06:50.620> yet<00:06:51.190> if<00:06:51.639> you<00:06:51.850> do

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.060 
then there's an e-flat yet if you do

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.409 
then there's an e-flat yet if you do
this<00:06:52.530> if<00:06:53.530> I<00:06:53.770> be<00:06:53.979> flat<00:06:54.250> for<00:06:54.430> the<00:06:54.490> day<00:06:54.700> but<00:06:54.940> if<00:06:55.240> I
