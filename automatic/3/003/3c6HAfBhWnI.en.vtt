and a fairly small club head pretty
aerodynamic<00:02:17.860> to<00:02:18.270> how<00:02:19.270> it<00:02:19.360> looks<00:02:22.350> loose<00:02:23.350> it

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
aerodynamic to how it looks loose it

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.760 
aerodynamic to how it looks loose it
so<00:02:24.520> yeah<00:02:24.820> watch<00:02:25.660> shaft<00:02:25.959> also<00:02:26.140> has<00:02:26.410> a<00:02:26.560> top

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
so yeah watch shaft also has a top

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:32.310 
so yeah watch shaft also has a top
flight<00:02:27.450> graphite<00:02:28.450> or<00:02:28.810> flux<00:02:29.670> yeah<00:02:31.110> alright<00:02:32.110> so

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
flight graphite or flux yeah alright so

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.900 
flight graphite or flux yeah alright so
that's<00:02:32.470> that<00:02:32.890> and<00:02:33.190> now<00:02:33.370> we're<00:02:33.550> coming<00:02:33.790> up<00:02:33.850> to

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
that's that and now we're coming up to

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.140 
that's that and now we're coming up to
the<00:02:34.120> hybrids<00:02:35.370> just<00:02:36.370> in<00:02:36.520> case<00:02:36.730> some<00:02:37.000> of<00:02:37.090> you

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
the hybrids just in case some of you

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.350 
the hybrids just in case some of you
guys<00:02:37.240> don't<00:02:37.300> know<00:02:37.690> hybrids<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:39.250> main<00:02:39.520> the

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
guys don't know hybrids the main the

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.660 
guys don't know hybrids the main the
main<00:02:40.720> reason<00:02:41.440> why<00:02:41.560> they<00:02:41.800> were<00:02:41.860> created<00:02:42.489> is

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
main reason why they were created is

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.300 
main reason why they were created is
because<00:02:43.060> hitting<00:02:43.900> irons<00:02:44.290> in<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.680> lower<00:02:44.980> irons

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
because hitting irons in the lower irons

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.070 
because hitting irons in the lower irons
like<00:02:45.430> three<00:02:45.730> and<00:02:45.820> four<00:02:46.090> irons<00:02:46.540> they're

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
like three and four irons they're

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.390 
like three and four irons they're
extremely<00:02:47.470> hard<00:02:47.769> so<00:02:48.160> by<00:02:48.700> giving<00:02:49.030> this<00:02:49.360> a<00:02:49.630> moron

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
extremely hard so by giving this a moron

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.300 
extremely hard so by giving this a moron
I'd<00:02:51.400> say<00:02:52.410> I'm<00:02:53.410> like<00:02:53.620> an<00:02:53.739> iron<00:02:53.890> it's<00:02:54.070> not<00:02:54.280> a

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
I'd say I'm like an iron it's not a

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.060 
I'd say I'm like an iron it's not a
blade<00:02:54.700> it's<00:02:54.970> actually<00:02:55.540> a<00:02:55.780> club<00:02:56.410> head<00:02:56.680> and<00:02:56.920> that

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
blade it's actually a club head and that

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.120 
blade it's actually a club head and that

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
lets say be easier this is a 18 degree

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.199 
lets say be easier this is a 18 degree
three<00:03:00.940> hybrid<00:03:01.510> shaft<00:03:01.810> a<00:03:02.170> three<00:03:03.070> hybrid<00:03:03.519> head
