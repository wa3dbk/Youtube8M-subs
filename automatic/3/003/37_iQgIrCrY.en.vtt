00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.320 
getting there
take<00:03:05.890> some<00:03:06.100> offense<00:03:06.459> out<00:03:06.580> of<00:03:06.730> our<00:03:06.820> lineup<00:03:07.030> and

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
take some offense out of our lineup and

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.580 
take some offense out of our lineup and
that's<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:07.600> next<00:03:07.720> question<00:03:07.840> to<00:03:08.290> be<00:03:08.410> who

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
that's the next question to be who

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.440 
that's the next question to be who

replaces the offense that we're losing
today<00:03:10.900> but<00:03:11.740> I<00:03:11.770> think<00:03:11.980> it<00:03:12.070> puts<00:03:12.310> a<00:03:12.459> big<00:03:12.760> weapon

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
today but I think it puts a big weapon

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.760 
today but I think it puts a big weapon
on<00:03:13.240> a<00:03:13.270> blue<00:03:13.510> line<00:03:13.720> it<00:03:13.930> makes<00:03:14.140> this<00:03:14.290> much<00:03:14.560> more

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
on a blue line it makes this much more

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.370 
on a blue line it makes this much more
difficult<00:03:14.830> to<00:03:15.370> play<00:03:15.519> against<00:03:15.910> and<00:03:16.200> now<00:03:17.200> we'll

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
difficult to play against and now we'll

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.380 
difficult to play against and now we'll
