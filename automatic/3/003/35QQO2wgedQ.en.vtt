00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 and the 12-13 years that I wanted to dance what 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.899
 it happens that he could not there were no schools 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.899
 in valencia where they lived 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.450
 I could not I did not know how to present it to my 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.690
 parents either 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.250
 and then I decided to do something that 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.630
 it seemed or that at least that 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:24.029
 stage approach and that was it 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.359
 so I had to wait until I could 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.250
 go to have to be independent 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.079
 economically and to be able to afford me 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.329
 travel and go and present good hearing 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:35.280
 in london and start studying ballet 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.100
 but I wanted already from very early 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.230
 age 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.809
 since I left Spain every two years 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.430
 changed country will be changed from 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:47.289
 teachers and school because I do not 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.289
 liked and burned very soon 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.140
 i 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.510
 many times I know very well what I want 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.680
 do but I have no idea how it came 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.960
 there 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.120
 and I find myself uncomfortable until I arrive 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.520
 and suddenly it came and that's what I wanted 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.620
 and other times the other way around there are times that I go 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.580
 down a path and I feel very comfortable I see 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.620
 things I like 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.750
 what I play I recognize it but then 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.520
 came to the end and it is a disaster 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.970
 what 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.470
 the truth is that I do not know very well 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.210
 when I'm doing things that's what 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.210
 what am I doing what I do know is 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.950
 I have to do it if I do not explode 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.040
 by some side it 's a very need 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.040
 big 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.000
 and my influences when it comes to see my 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:49.570
 work because maybe they look more 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.310
 that come from the Netherlands and from Stockholm 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.450
 is where more time is more years is 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.450
 dancing that from here of Spain 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.469
 yes 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.140
 I do not know 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.030
 i 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.340
 I find it very difficult the day it comes and 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:14.030
 to see that I do not want to devote myself more to 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.459
 dance but maybe because it's older or 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.670
 because I get tired of certain things because I 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.210
 dedicate something else 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.530
 Y 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.530
 I will dedicate myself to something else 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.520
 I will not have a great time too
