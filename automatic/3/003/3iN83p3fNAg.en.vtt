00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.450
 nice to come here from eindhoven 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.030
 the design city of the Netherlands 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.690
 that was very definitely this is true 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.780
 to experience 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.630
 well the get no propaganda 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:18.260
 Microsoft that itself is not really a unit 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.939
 but area of ​​about piste lol 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.740
 have several projects 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.670
 fortunately you also often video of 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.320
 makes 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.050
 I want to watch them with pleasure 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.730
 among other things, to know who that was 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.309
 this case must be a yes 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.160
 well what online copenhagen also real 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.050
 lived and studied for years 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.489
 project was actually an existing one 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.200
 project is a project that i'm in 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.010
 more free time no and I the package 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.010
 Sent room out of you in and followed 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.010
 warrior 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.010
 how long for how long nothing has been on the road 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:09.610
 namely base was something like May this year 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.170
 less than 4 but you can tell that the 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.850
 camera 430 hours late 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.830
 but that is quite a problem 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.200
 because i had a thing i also got it here 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.180
 becomes parts that were in the box 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.979
 unfortunately the box even lives unfortunately 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.630
 not with god is somehow small 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.440
 cheap MP look like dollars too 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:29.410
 come in a little or some spice this is 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.729
 this little black service is so is this 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.080
 no one is going to sit you in the middle 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:33.550
 of the v yes i had it mine to the 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.649
 unwritten because holes were waiting 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.149
 of course it's all about you shouldn't either 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:47.020
 too far with me it was a chaos of 2 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:49.720
 at 2 mm, the spring is almost as throne in the 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.130
 in the technical can what how did you do that 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.479
 then done to run for so long 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.880
 see really four and three hours in progress 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.460
 been or how every minute makes it 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.660
 camera in a small video must be three 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.640
 seconds 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.260
 unless the package I was moving 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.420
 had a small motion sensor and 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:08.679
 it took you that you are still with maria 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.479
 there is this little thing 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:14.890
 this the movement and so-called ordinary 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.390
 tilt shift but my hypothesis is 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.930
 actually that his own moment who 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.820
 want 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.530
 wants to capture that moment that he 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.940
 moves so that moment that 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.660
 motion sensor movement quite 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.250
 interesting 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.070
 yes than van danny has longer pieces 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.019
 of 1 and 2 minutes why did you want it 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.290
 but I already picked up an idea at home 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.670
 and explain to them who had van 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.920
 we learn from day in but I have to 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.390
 actually just do it so i do 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.260
 a weekend and finally half 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:43.380
 last year busy all routes 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.970
 little together that 's what yes i am 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.820
 the early pitch 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.680
 so it himself out at the end 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.150
 most of my dad really genius too 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.150
 know what a bomb looks like 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.930
 you get sweaty it was really cut off 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.540
 I already want to go through ziggo bank 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.180
 calls on you now I was there 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:09.270
 a note with a duration of the 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:11.340
 is not a source but connect the first one 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.920
 watched the movie I thought yes in luck 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.500
 that the box wasn't about to be turned around 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.230
 but that we think is actually right 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.030
 well no i also have quite what i am 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.330
 I also had about 250 hours on 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.860
 video material and I succeeded 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.440
 because with this trip it really is already 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.670
 immediately taken from a house 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.650
