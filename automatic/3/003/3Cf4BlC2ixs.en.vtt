before I begin lesson 15 on lesson 4 I
mean<00:00:14.580> unless<00:00:15.000> in<00:00:15.150> 13<00:00:15.540> I<00:00:15.780> made<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.770> little

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
mean unless in 13 I made a little

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.269 
mean unless in 13 I made a little
mistake<00:00:18.410> or<00:00:19.970> this<00:00:20.970> sheet<00:00:21.480> okay<00:00:21.920> I've<00:00:22.920> got<00:00:23.160> to

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
mistake or this sheet okay I've got to

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.419 
mistake or this sheet okay I've got to
put<00:00:23.460> in<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:24.769> little<00:00:25.769> slash<00:00:26.340> but<00:00:27.890> to<00:00:28.890> make<00:00:29.250> it

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
put in the little slash but to make it

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.049 
put in the little slash but to make it
Gideon<00:00:30.740> so<00:00:31.740> unless<00:00:32.160> important<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.910> was

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
Gideon so unless important it was

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.420 
Gideon so unless important it was
missing<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.809> little<00:00:33.989> long

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
missing that little long

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.830 
missing that little long
slash<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:37.640> would<00:00:38.640> be<00:00:39.149> pronounced<00:00:39.600> clang

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
slash and would be pronounced clang

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.380 
slash and would be pronounced clang
which<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.230> incorrect<00:00:40.829> but<00:00:41.760> this<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.239> right

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
which is incorrect but this is the right

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.790 
which is incorrect but this is the right
spelling<00:00:42.690> for<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.079> in<00:00:43.200> kamae

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
spelling for it in kamae

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.400 
spelling for it in kamae
so<00:00:44.370> it's<00:00:44.489> pronounced<00:00:45.030> Gideon<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.230> it's

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
so it's pronounced Gideon and it's

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.869 
so it's pronounced Gideon and it's
spelled<00:00:46.620> like<00:00:47.210> that<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.980> also<00:00:50.010> recycled<00:00:50.789> it

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
spelled like that and I also recycled it

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.650 
spelled like that and I also recycled it
for<00:00:51.090> lesson<00:00:51.329> 14<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.940> that<00:00:53.940> was<00:00:54.059> incorrect<00:00:54.420> too

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
for lesson 14 and that was incorrect too

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.819 
for lesson 14 and that was incorrect too
but<00:00:54.989> this<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.379> right<00:00:55.530> one

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
but this is the right one

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.630 
but this is the right one
