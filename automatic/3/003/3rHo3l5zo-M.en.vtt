00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
not very far from the ground um they

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.160 
not very far from the ground um they
they<00:01:03.489> get<00:01:03.879> really<00:01:04.030> scratched<00:01:04.420> up<00:01:04.719> especially

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
they get really scratched up especially

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.300 
they get really scratched up especially
right<00:01:05.799> here<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:08.619> can<00:01:08.770> see<00:01:08.799> if<00:01:09.069> there's<00:01:09.219> all

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
right here you can see if there's all

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149 
and speakers and then this look forward

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:21.269 
and speakers and then this look forward
to<00:01:16.569> sip<00:01:17.409> I<00:01:18.179> don't<00:01:19.179> get<00:01:19.389> that<00:01:19.689> the<00:01:20.499> wheels<00:01:20.829> on

00:01:21.269 --> 00:01:21.279 
to sip I don't get that the wheels on

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:25.399 
to sip I don't get that the wheels on
are<00:01:21.670> just<00:01:21.869> plastic<00:01:23.130> complete<00:01:24.130> plastic

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
are just plastic complete plastic

seatbelts<00:01:26.409> are<00:01:26.560> really<00:01:27.009> weird<00:01:33.389> that's<00:01:34.389> about

00:01:34.769 --> 00:01:34.779 
seatbelts are really weird that's about

00:01:34.779 --> 00:02:45.250 
seatbelts are really weird that's about
it

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.850 

okay<00:02:46.970> the<00:02:47.970> headlights<00:02:48.420> do<00:02:48.840> light<00:02:49.140> up<00:02:49.170> they're

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
okay the headlights do light up they're

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.510 
okay the headlights do light up they're
kind<00:02:50.190> they're<00:02:50.430> faint<00:02:51.120> but<00:02:51.920> they<00:02:52.920> work

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
kind they're faint but they work

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.810 
kind they're faint but they work
there's<00:02:53.910> directional<00:02:54.570> signals<00:02:54.930> in<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.230> front

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
there's directional signals in the front

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.870 
there's directional signals in the front
see<00:02:56.820> and<00:02:57.030> then<00:02:57.660> there's<00:02:58.260> a<00:02:58.880> directional

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
see and then there's a directional

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:07.310 
see and then there's a directional
signal<00:03:00.360> on<00:03:01.320> the<00:03:01.740> back<00:03:01.980> lights<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:05.810> I<00:03:06.810> great

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
signal on the back lights and I great

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:15.980 
signal on the back lights and I great
this<00:03:07.500> car<00:03:07.830> about<00:03:11.030> I'd<00:03:12.030> say<00:03:12.090> a<00:03:12.870> a<00:03:13.550> B<00:03:14.990> because

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
this car about I'd say a a B because

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.420 
this car about I'd say a a B because
it's<00:03:16.350> very<00:03:17.100> fast<00:03:17.460> and<00:03:18.350> maneuverable<00:03:19.350> as<00:03:20.220> you

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
it's very fast and maneuverable as you

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.370 
it's very fast and maneuverable as you
as<00:03:20.610> you<00:03:21.150> saw<00:03:21.330> in<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:21.570> driving<00:03:21.840> kind<00:03:22.170> of<00:03:22.230> thick

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
as you saw in the driving kind of thick

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.220 
as you saw in the driving kind of thick
and<00:03:22.410> kind<00:03:23.040> of<00:03:23.130> drift<00:03:23.550> though<00:03:24.480> it's<00:03:24.780> very

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
and kind of drift though it's very

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.910 
and kind of drift though it's very
detailed<00:03:25.590> and<00:03:26.959> it<00:03:27.959> uses<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.470> pistol<00:03:28.890> grip

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
detailed and it uses the pistol grip

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.760 
detailed and it uses the pistol grip
controller<00:03:29.550> and<00:03:29.970> it<00:03:30.300> is<00:03:30.690> not<00:03:30.990> proportional

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
controller and it is not proportional

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.550 
controller and it is not proportional
steering<00:03:32.040> and<00:03:32.520> it<00:03:33.209> does<00:03:33.390> not<00:03:33.570> have<00:03:33.810> a<00:03:33.959> B<00:03:34.080> and<00:03:34.410> C

steering and it does not have a B and C
frequencies<00:03:35.160> it's<00:03:35.370> twenty<00:03:36.209> seven<00:03:36.540> or<00:03:36.720> twenty

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
frequencies it's twenty seven or twenty

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.140 
frequencies it's twenty seven or twenty
or<00:03:37.140> forty<00:03:37.620> nine<00:03:39.709> I<00:03:40.709> don't<00:03:41.700> really<00:03:41.850> know<00:03:42.030> what

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
or forty nine I don't really know what

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.650 
or forty nine I don't really know what
those<00:03:42.390> mean<00:03:42.720> but<00:03:43.820> it<00:03:44.820> is<00:03:45.090> proportional

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
those mean but it is proportional

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.050 
those mean but it is proportional
throttle<00:03:48.019> but<00:03:49.019> this<00:03:49.489> comes<00:03:50.489> out<00:03:50.670> like<00:03:50.820> that

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
throttle but this comes out like that

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.930 
throttle but this comes out like that
it's<00:03:51.840> kind<00:03:52.050> of<00:03:52.080> hard<00:03:52.140> unbox<00:03:52.739> it<00:03:52.980> comes<00:03:53.550> with<00:03:53.790> a

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
it's kind of hard unbox it comes with a

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.790 
it's kind of hard unbox it comes with a
9-volt<00:03:54.480> battery<00:03:54.840> for<00:03:55.050> the<00:03:55.110> controller<00:03:55.470> and

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
9-volt battery for the controller and

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:07.370 
9-volt battery for the controller and
rechargeable<00:03:56.430> for<00:03:57.390> the<00:03:58.850> car<00:03:59.850> and<00:04:05.870> the<00:04:06.870> charge

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
rechargeable for the car and the charge

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.890 
rechargeable for the car and the charge
time<00:04:07.680> is<00:04:07.920> really<00:04:08.310> long<00:04:08.550> for<00:04:09.060> the<00:04:09.239> car<00:04:09.480> battery

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
time is really long for the car battery

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:16.159 
time is really long for the car battery
it<00:04:10.709> takes<00:04:11.310> about<00:04:11.400> four<00:04:11.820> hours<00:04:13.730> and<00:04:14.810> that's<00:04:15.810> the

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
it takes about four hours and that's the

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.500 
it takes about four hours and that's the
real
