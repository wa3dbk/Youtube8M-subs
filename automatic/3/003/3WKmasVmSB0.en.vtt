00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
few stitches so you can see how we will

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.080 
few stitches so you can see how we will
be<00:00:53.970> joining<00:00:54.420> these<00:00:54.570> stitches<00:00:55.010> all<00:00:56.010> the

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090

upper piece look like a V so each V

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.160 
upper piece look like a V so each V
makes<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.339> point<00:01:05.729> we<00:01:06.509> are<00:01:06.600> going<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.780> be<00:01:06.899> joining

makes a point we are going to be joining

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.039 
makes a point we are going to be joining
the<00:01:07.380> points<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.130> upper<00:01:08.670> piece<00:01:08.939> two<00:01:09.630> points

is<00:02:27.049> upside<00:02:28.049> down<00:02:28.110> or<00:02:28.739> the<00:02:28.860> first<00:02:29.159> stitch<00:02:29.670> here

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
is upside down or the first stitch here

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.780 
is upside down or the first stitch here
and<00:02:30.269> you<00:02:30.750> can<00:02:30.930> see<00:02:31.140> there's<00:02:31.440> it's<00:02:31.709> point<00:02:32.129> so<00:02:32.760> I

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
and you can see there's it's point so I

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.059 
and you can see there's it's point so I
will<00:02:33.060> then<00:02:33.209> go<00:02:33.420> under<00:02:33.720> both<00:02:33.959> legs<00:02:34.409> of<00:02:34.620> that

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
will then go under both legs of that

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:40.039 
will then go under both legs of that
inverted<00:02:35.760> V<00:02:36.530> like<00:02:37.530> so<00:02:37.829> and<00:02:38.420> then<00:02:39.420> draw<00:02:39.629> my<00:02:39.840> yarn

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
inverted V like so and then draw my yarn

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:44.720 
inverted V like so and then draw my yarn
through<00:02:42.230> now<00:02:43.230> you<00:02:43.260> can<00:02:43.620> tighten<00:02:43.950> up<00:02:44.190> as<00:02:44.400> you<00:02:44.549> go

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
through now you can tighten up as you go

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.309 
through now you can tighten up as you go
you<00:02:44.790> want<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.150> make<00:02:45.299> it<00:02:45.450> tight<00:02:45.690> enough<00:02:45.959> that

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
you want to make it tight enough that

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.699 
you want to make it tight enough that
the<00:02:46.940> bound<00:02:47.940> off<00:02:48.239> edges<00:02:48.720> get<00:02:48.900> hidden<00:02:49.230> but<00:02:49.620> you

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
the bound off edges get hidden but you

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.289 
the bound off edges get hidden but you
can<00:02:49.859> also<00:02:50.010> do<00:02:50.250> a<00:02:50.280> few<00:02:50.370> stitches<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.030> then

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
can also do a few stitches and then

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.330 
can also do a few stitches and then
tighten<00:02:51.750> up<00:02:51.840> so<00:02:52.709> now<00:02:52.859> I'm<00:02:52.950> going<00:02:53.069> to<00:02:53.160> come<00:02:53.310> back

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
tighten up so now I'm going to come back

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.000 
tighten up so now I'm going to come back
to<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.790> top<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:54.390> go<00:02:54.660> under<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.170> two<00:02:55.560> legs<00:02:55.859> of

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
to the top and go under the two legs of

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.339 
to the top and go under the two legs of
the<00:02:56.069> next<00:02:56.519> V<00:02:56.730> here's<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.690> point<00:02:59.989> and<00:03:00.989> draw

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
the next V here's the point and draw

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:07.759 
the next V here's the point and draw
your<00:03:01.560> yarn<00:03:01.799> through<00:03:02.099> again<00:03:06.230> back<00:03:07.230> to<00:03:07.620> the

bottom here's the next upside-down V or
the<00:03:12.000> point<00:03:12.450> here<00:03:12.810> go<00:03:13.620> under<00:03:14.159> both<00:03:14.340> of<00:03:14.400> those

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
the point here go under both of those

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:22.990 
the point here go under both of those
legs<00:03:19.970> now<00:03:20.970> that<00:03:21.150> I've<00:03:21.269> completed<00:03:21.750> one<00:03:22.260> full

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
legs now that I've completed one full

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.170 
legs now that I've completed one full
you<00:03:24.000> can<00:03:24.150> see<00:03:24.419> how<00:03:24.690> I'm<00:03:24.950> creating<00:03:25.950> this<00:03:26.579> stitch

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
you can see how I'm creating this stitch

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.300 
you can see how I'm creating this stitch
here<00:03:27.209> that<00:03:28.109> will<00:03:28.319> look<00:03:28.500> like<00:03:28.560> all<00:03:29.010> of<00:03:29.190> the

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
here that will look like all of the

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.619 
here that will look like all of the
other<00:03:29.549> stitches<00:03:30.000> above<00:03:30.900> it<00:03:31.760> so<00:03:32.760> come<00:03:33.239> back<00:03:33.419> up

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
other stitches above it so come back up

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:37.940 
other stitches above it so come back up
to<00:03:33.660> the<00:03:33.900> top<00:03:34.139> go<00:03:34.739> under<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.160> next<00:03:35.660> V<00:03:36.660> both<00:03:37.379> legs

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
to the top go under the next V both legs

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.509 
to the top go under the next V both legs
which<00:03:38.370> makes<00:03:38.669> that<00:03:38.910> point<00:03:39.720> right<00:03:39.959> here<00:03:40.519> under

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
which makes that point right here under

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:47.869 
which makes that point right here under
that<00:03:44.389> and<00:03:45.389> I'll<00:03:45.660> come<00:03:45.900> to<00:03:46.079> the<00:03:46.199> bottom<00:03:46.879> here's

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
that and I'll come to the bottom here's

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:50.869 
that and I'll come to the bottom here's
my<00:03:48.150> last<00:03:48.510> marked<00:03:49.049> one<00:03:49.489> upside<00:03:50.489> down<00:03:50.669> or

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 
my last marked one upside down or

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:55.129 
my last marked one upside down or
inverted<00:03:51.389> V<00:03:51.569> there's<00:03:51.900> its<00:03:52.109> point<00:03:53.569> and<00:03:54.569> put<00:03:54.959> go

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
inverted V there's its point and put go

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:59.110 
inverted V there's its point and put go
under<00:03:55.379> those<00:03:55.530> two<00:03:56.449> draw<00:03:57.449> your<00:03:57.690> yarn<00:03:57.959> through

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
under those two draw your yarn through

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.360 
under those two draw your yarn through
let's<00:04:00.120> do<00:04:00.329> a<00:04:00.720> couple<00:04:01.230> where<00:04:01.620> I<00:04:01.650> don't<00:04:01.829> have<00:04:02.220> the

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
let's do a couple where I don't have the

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.309 
let's do a couple where I don't have the
stitches<00:04:02.699> mark<00:04:02.940> so<00:04:03.150> you<00:04:03.389> can<00:04:03.569> see<00:04:03.810> that<00:04:04.019> so

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
stitches mark so you can see that so

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:10.490 
stitches mark so you can see that so
here<00:04:04.650> is<00:04:04.799> my<00:04:05.010> next<00:04:05.400> V<00:04:08.299> go<00:04:09.299> under<00:04:09.690> both<00:04:09.930> legs<00:04:09.989> of

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
here is my next V go under both legs of

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.530 
here is my next V go under both legs of
that

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:21.960 

and<00:04:17.010> below<00:04:18.329> here's<00:04:19.329> the<00:04:19.600> next<00:04:19.989> a<00:04:20.700> go<00:04:21.700> under

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
and below here's the next a go under

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:29.190 
and below here's the next a go under
both<00:04:22.180> legs<00:04:22.240> of<00:04:22.930> that<00:04:26.130> and<00:04:27.130> you<00:04:27.520> can<00:04:27.700> see<00:04:28.200> that

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
both legs of that and you can see that

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.850 
both legs of that and you can see that
we<00:04:29.320> are<00:04:29.470> creating<00:04:30.010> a<00:04:30.250> very<00:04:30.820> nice<00:04:31.620> and<00:04:33.030> seamless

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
we are creating a very nice and seamless

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.400 
we are creating a very nice and seamless
invisible<00:04:35.860> join<00:04:36.419> now<00:04:37.419> sometimes<00:04:37.900> when<00:04:38.200> we're

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
invisible join now sometimes when we're

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.340 
invisible join now sometimes when we're
doing<00:04:38.710> this<00:04:38.919> we<00:04:39.639> can<00:04:39.880> run<00:04:40.210> into<00:04:40.450> some<00:04:40.780> special

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
doing this we can run into some special

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.850 
doing this we can run into some special
circumstances<00:04:41.820> where<00:04:42.820> maybe<00:04:43.450> one<00:04:43.930> side<00:04:44.500> has

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
circumstances where maybe one side has

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.400 
circumstances where maybe one side has
more<00:04:45.190> stitches<00:04:45.760> than<00:04:46.000> the<00:04:46.120> other<00:04:46.320> so<00:04:47.320> I'll

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
more stitches than the other so I'll

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.909 
more stitches than the other so I'll
show<00:04:47.620> you<00:04:47.650> how<00:04:47.919> to<00:04:47.980> handle<00:04:48.340> that<00:04:49.620> there<00:04:50.620> we<00:04:50.740> go

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
show you how to handle that there we go

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:53.790 
show you how to handle that there we go
so<00:04:51.640> let's<00:04:51.850> say<00:04:52.060> that<00:04:52.090> this<00:04:52.480> top<00:04:52.900> piece<00:04:53.260> had

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
so let's say that this top piece had

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.390 
so let's say that this top piece had
more<00:04:54.790> stitches<00:04:55.480> than<00:04:55.510> the<00:04:55.930> lower<00:04:56.140> piece<00:04:56.530> so

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
more stitches than the lower piece so

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.760 
more stitches than the lower piece so
you<00:04:57.490> may<00:04:57.790> need<00:04:57.970> to<00:04:58.030> ease<00:04:58.450> in<00:04:58.780> that<00:04:58.990> fullness<00:04:59.530> by

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
you may need to ease in that fullness by

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.240 
you may need to ease in that fullness by
instead<00:05:00.100> of<00:05:00.250> taking<00:05:00.870> two<00:05:01.870> legs<00:05:02.260> or<00:05:02.620> the<00:05:02.800> entire

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
instead of taking two legs or the entire

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.760 
instead of taking two legs or the entire
V<00:05:03.640> here<00:05:03.970> maybe<00:05:04.240> you<00:05:04.510> might<00:05:04.720> need<00:05:04.900> to<00:05:05.080> do<00:05:05.260> one

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
V here maybe you might need to do one

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.280 
V here maybe you might need to do one
and<00:05:05.950> a<00:05:06.010> half<00:05:06.250> stitches<00:05:06.640> and<00:05:07.090> do<00:05:07.780> that<00:05:07.990> every

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
and a half stitches and do that every

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.500 
and a half stitches and do that every
once<00:05:08.440> in<00:05:08.650> a<00:05:08.770> while<00:05:08.800> just<00:05:09.010> to<00:05:09.610> sort<00:05:09.820> of<00:05:09.970> ease<00:05:10.330> in

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
once in a while just to sort of ease in

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.980 
once in a while just to sort of ease in
that<00:05:10.720> fullness<00:05:11.080> and<00:05:11.530> that<00:05:11.880> small

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
that fullness and that small

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.830 
that fullness and that small
interruption<00:05:13.990> in<00:05:14.260> the<00:05:14.770> pattern<00:05:15.430> won't<00:05:16.419> really

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
interruption in the pattern won't really

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.159 
interruption in the pattern won't really
make<00:05:17.460> that<00:05:18.460> much<00:05:18.880> of<00:05:19.120> a<00:05:19.360> difference<00:05:19.780> you<00:05:19.870> won't

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 
make that much of a difference you won't

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:22.650 
make that much of a difference you won't
really<00:05:20.440> be<00:05:20.590> able<00:05:20.710> to<00:05:20.890> detect<00:05:21.460> it<00:05:21.729> especially

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
really be able to detect it especially

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.659 
really be able to detect it especially
when<00:05:22.900> the<00:05:23.410> patterns<00:05:23.979> on<00:05:24.130> the<00:05:24.220> top<00:05:24.430> and<00:05:24.580> the

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:24.669 
when the patterns on the top and the

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:26.219 
when the patterns on the top and the
bottom<00:05:24.790> may<00:05:25.060> be<00:05:25.120> different<00:05:25.600> this<00:05:25.750> happens<00:05:26.110> if

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:26.229 
bottom may be different this happens if

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:29.430 
bottom may be different this happens if
you<00:05:26.350> have<00:05:26.440> cables<00:05:26.979> here<00:05:27.400> or<00:05:27.640> ribs<00:05:28.440> something

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
you have cables here or ribs something

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.820 
you have cables here or ribs something
to<00:05:29.590> that<00:05:29.740> effect<00:05:30.690> so<00:05:31.690> there<00:05:31.960> you<00:05:32.110> have<00:05:32.140> it<00:05:32.320> the

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
to that effect so there you have it the

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:45.439 
to that effect so there you have it the
invisible<00:05:33.900> horizontal<00:05:34.900> seam<00:05:36.240> happy<00:05:37.240> knitting
