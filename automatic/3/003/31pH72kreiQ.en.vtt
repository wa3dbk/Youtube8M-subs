00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:08.540 

we<00:00:06.529> just<00:00:06.740> created<00:00:07.069> recruit

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
we just created recruit

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.040 
we just created recruit
system<00:00:09.060> that<00:00:09.180> we've<00:00:09.300> had<00:00:09.420> on<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.720> other<00:00:09.750> wall

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
system that we've had on the other wall

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.950 
system that we've had on the other wall
and<00:00:10.610> from<00:00:11.610> this<00:00:11.820> we<00:00:12.120> already<00:00:12.540> figured<00:00:12.780> out

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
and from this we already figured out

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.920 
and from this we already figured out
what<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.139> slope<00:00:13.320> was<00:00:13.680> which<00:00:13.980> is<00:00:14.190> y2<00:00:15.030> minus<00:00:15.450> y2

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:15.930 
what the slope was which is y2 minus y2

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.550 
what the slope was which is y2 minus y2
minus<00:00:16.290> y1<00:00:16.440> divided<00:00:17.160> by<00:00:17.369> x2<00:00:17.730> minus<00:00:17.939> x1<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.720> then

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
minus y1 divided by x2 minus x1 and then

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.870 
minus y1 divided by x2 minus x1 and then
we<00:00:19.710> figured<00:00:20.010> out<00:00:20.070> what<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.250> midpoint<00:00:20.700> was

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
we figured out what the midpoint was

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.190 
we figured out what the midpoint was
which<00:00:21.119> was<00:00:21.150> here<00:00:21.540> which<00:00:21.689> was<00:00:21.840> taking<00:00:22.110> the

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.200 
which was here which was taking the

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.630 
which was here which was taking the
average<00:00:22.349> of<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.770> axis<00:00:23.070> in<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.279> average<00:00:23.520> it

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
average of the axis in the average it

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.019 
average of the axis in the average it
was<00:00:24.410> the<00:00:25.410> third<00:00:25.890> most<00:00:26.189> important<00:00:26.730> thing<00:00:26.910> they

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
was the third most important thing they

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.690 
was the third most important thing they
ask<00:00:27.270> you<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.960> do<00:00:28.439> with<00:00:28.710> lines<00:00:29.040> is<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.550> figure

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:29.700 
ask you to do with lines is to figure

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.859 
ask you to do with lines is to figure
out<00:00:29.820> what<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.060> distance<00:00:30.419> between<00:00:30.540> these<00:00:30.810> two

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
out what the distance between these two

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.229 
out what the distance between these two
lines<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.439> now<00:00:32.220> the<00:00:32.279> distance<00:00:32.790> between<00:00:32.910> these

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
lines is now the distance between these

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.740 
lines is now the distance between these
two<00:00:33.300> lines<00:00:33.770> comes<00:00:34.770> out<00:00:34.980> through<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.750> is

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
two lines comes out through the is

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.110 
two lines comes out through the is
derived<00:00:37.230> from<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.590> Pythagorean<00:00:38.220> theorem<00:00:38.579> now

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
derived from the Pythagorean theorem now

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.520 
derived from the Pythagorean theorem now
the<00:00:39.180> Pythagorean<00:00:39.810> theorem<00:00:40.050> if<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.200> remember

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
the Pythagorean theorem if you remember

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:48.590 
the Pythagorean theorem if you remember
is<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.710> right<00:00:40.980> triangle<00:00:46.910> so<00:00:47.910> all<00:00:48.090> we're<00:00:48.269> doing

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
is a right triangle so all we're doing

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.580 
is a right triangle so all we're doing
is<00:00:49.699> for<00:00:50.699> this<00:00:50.910> line<00:00:51.179> is<00:00:51.510> taking<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:52.079> points

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
is for this line is taking the points

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.889 
is for this line is taking the points
and<00:00:53.059> connecting<00:00:54.059> up<00:00:54.179> the<00:00:54.210> wise<00:00:54.510> and

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
and connecting up the wise and

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.900 
and connecting up the wise and
connecting<00:00:55.530> up<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.679> excess<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.309> make<00:00:56.789> an

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
connecting up the excess and make an

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.520 
connecting up the excess and make an
award<00:00:57.239> making<00:00:57.839> vertical<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.440> horizontal

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
award making vertical and horizontal

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.340 
award making vertical and horizontal
lines<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.519> that<00:01:00.390> way<00:01:00.600> these<00:01:00.780> guys<00:01:00.989> become

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
lines and that way these guys become

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.910 
lines and that way these guys become
right<00:01:01.530> angles<00:01:01.920> okay<00:01:02.850> now<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.350> way<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.589> the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
right angles okay now the way to the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.050 
right angles okay now the way to the
Pythagorean<00:01:05.580> theorem<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.330> have

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.859 

and<00:01:11.060> you<00:01:11.180> got<00:01:11.360> sighs<00:01:11.689> see<00:01:13.180> so<00:01:14.180> according<00:01:14.780> to

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
and you got sighs see so according to

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.240 
and you got sighs see so according to
the<00:01:14.930> Pythagorean<00:01:15.619> theorem<00:01:16.009> the<00:01:16.490> formula<00:01:16.939> is<00:01:17.299> a

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
the Pythagorean theorem the formula is a

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.230 
the Pythagorean theorem the formula is a
squared<00:01:19.250> plus<00:01:19.789> B<00:01:20.180> squared<00:01:20.659> is<00:01:21.530> equal<00:01:21.590> to<00:01:22.240> C

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
squared plus B squared is equal to C

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.580 
squared plus B squared is equal to C
squared<00:01:24.520> now<00:01:25.520> that's<00:01:26.360> our<00:01:26.689> a<00:01:26.929> so<00:01:26.990> what<00:01:27.350> we<00:01:27.439> have

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
squared now that's our a so what we have

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.499 
squared now that's our a so what we have
to<00:01:27.619> figure<00:01:27.890> out<00:01:28.069> is<00:01:28.460> what<00:01:28.670> the<00:01:28.819> distance<00:01:29.270> is

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
to figure out is what the distance is

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.840 
to figure out is what the distance is
from<00:01:29.929> here<00:01:30.140> to<00:01:30.319> here<00:01:30.530> not<00:01:31.100> a<00:01:31.130> distance<00:01:31.640> from

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
from here to here not a distance from

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.999 
from here to here not a distance from
here<00:01:32.030> to<00:01:32.090> here<00:01:32.450> it's<00:01:33.140> just<00:01:33.289> the<00:01:33.530> axis

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
here to here it's just the axis

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:35.710 
here to here it's just the axis
subtracted<00:01:34.640> from<00:01:34.670> each<00:01:34.909> other<00:01:35.149> so<00:01:35.600> the

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
subtracted from each other so the

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.370 
subtracted from each other so the
formula<00:01:36.020> for<00:01:36.229> the<00:01:36.409> business<00:01:36.829> becomes<00:01:38.380> x2

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
formula for the business becomes x2

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.419 
formula for the business becomes x2
minus<00:01:40.030> x1<00:01:41.619> that's<00:01:42.619> the<00:01:42.799> distance<00:01:43.189> for<00:01:43.369> the

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:43.429 
minus x1 that's the distance for the

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:46.630 
minus x1 that's the distance for the
exes<00:01:43.819> now<00:01:44.390> x2<00:01:44.899> you<00:01:45.560> can<00:01:45.709> choose<00:01:45.920> either<00:01:46.189> one<00:01:46.369> to

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
exes now x2 you can choose either one to

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.130 
exes now x2 you can choose either one to
be<00:01:46.729> next<00:01:46.909> to<00:01:47.060> and<00:01:47.240> either<00:01:47.360> one<00:01:47.569> to<00:01:47.689> be<00:01:47.780> x1

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
be next to and either one to be x1

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.020 
be next to and either one to be x1
doesn't<00:01:48.470> make<00:01:48.560> a<00:01:48.590> difference<00:01:48.860> okay<00:01:49.490> because

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
doesn't make a difference okay because

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.109 
doesn't make a difference okay because
the<00:01:50.149> value<00:01:50.450> stays<00:01:50.990> the<00:01:51.170> same<00:01:51.409> so<00:01:51.880> let's<00:01:52.880> choose

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
the value stays the same so let's choose

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.749 
the value stays the same so let's choose
negative<00:01:53.509> 7<00:01:53.840> negative<00:01:53.869> 5<00:01:54.319> is<00:01:54.349> our<00:01:54.649> X<00:01:54.860> 2<00:01:55.130> so<00:01:55.610> this

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
negative 7 negative 5 is our X 2 so this

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:02.679 
negative 7 negative 5 is our X 2 so this
becomes<00:01:56.060> taken<00:01:59.079> 5-2<00:02:00.189> gives<00:02:01.189> us<00:02:01.429> negative<00:02:02.000> 7

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
becomes taken 5-2 gives us negative 7

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:04.960 
becomes taken 5-2 gives us negative 7
now<00:02:03.409> were<00:02:03.979> you<00:02:04.099> trying<00:02:04.340> to<00:02:04.459> figure<00:02:04.700> out<00:02:04.729> this

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
now were you trying to figure out this

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.880 
now were you trying to figure out this
test<00:02:05.270> you<00:02:05.539> don't<00:02:06.049> deal<00:02:06.259> with<00:02:06.439> the<00:02:06.530> negative

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
test you don't deal with the negative

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.190 
test you don't deal with the negative
numbers<00:02:07.220> so<00:02:08.060> the<00:02:08.239> distance<00:02:08.450> from<00:02:08.869> here<00:02:09.140> to

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
numbers so the distance from here to

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.220 
numbers so the distance from here to
here<00:02:09.500> is<00:02:09.649> not<00:02:09.829> negative<00:02:10.130> 7<00:02:10.700> is<00:02:10.759> really<00:02:11.120> 7<00:02:11.660> so

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
here is not negative 7 is really 7 so

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.020 
here is not negative 7 is really 7 so
what<00:02:12.410> you<00:02:12.530> do<00:02:12.709> is<00:02:12.739> you<00:02:13.549> take<00:02:13.579> the<00:02:13.790> absolute

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
what you do is you take the absolute

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.360 
what you do is you take the absolute
value<00:02:14.480> of<00:02:14.989> this<00:02:15.200> that<00:02:15.709> will<00:02:15.799> talk<00:02:16.040> about<00:02:16.190> this

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
value of this that will talk about this

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.430 
value of this that will talk about this
absolute<00:02:16.760> value<00:02:17.060> just<00:02:17.209> means<00:02:17.450> no<00:02:17.870> matter<00:02:18.049> what

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
absolute value just means no matter what

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.130 
absolute value just means no matter what
this<00:02:18.620> number<00:02:18.859> is<00:02:19.010> it<00:02:19.280> comes<00:02:19.519> out<00:02:19.640> positive<00:02:20.140> so

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
this number is it comes out positive so

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.759 
this number is it comes out positive so
this<00:02:21.170> becomes<00:02:21.650> 7<00:02:22.100> so<00:02:22.670> x2<00:02:23.120> minus<00:02:23.420> x1<00:02:23.930> is<00:02:24.350> really

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
this becomes 7 so x2 minus x1 is really

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.670 
this becomes 7 so x2 minus x1 is really
just<00:02:25.010> seven<00:02:25.850> then<00:02:26.840> you<00:02:26.959> do<00:02:27.139> it<00:02:27.260> for<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.470> wise

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
just seven then you do it for the wise

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.490 
just seven then you do it for the wise
as<00:02:27.950> well<00:02:28.160> wise<00:02:28.850> we<00:02:29.389> chose<00:02:29.660> this<00:02:29.900> one<00:02:30.109> to<00:02:30.260> be<00:02:30.350> our

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
as well wise we chose this one to be our

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.250 
as well wise we chose this one to be our
X<00:02:30.680> 2<00:02:30.920> X<00:02:31.250> 2<00:02:31.519> so<00:02:32.180> we're<00:02:32.329> going<00:02:32.450> to<00:02:32.540> choose<00:02:32.750> this<00:02:32.989> to

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
X 2 X 2 so we're going to choose this to

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.130 
X 2 X 2 so we're going to choose this to
be<00:02:33.380> our<00:02:33.620> one<00:02:33.980> so<00:02:34.850> why<00:02:35.090> two<00:02:35.150> before

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
be our one so why two before

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.260 
be our one so why two before
or<00:02:36.490> figuring<00:02:37.490> out<00:02:37.490> the<00:02:37.670> distance<00:02:38.000> the

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
or figuring out the distance the

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.150 
or figuring out the distance the
vertical<00:02:38.660> distance<00:02:38.990> is<00:02:39.110> going<00:02:39.260> to<00:02:39.319> be<00:02:39.440> y2

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
vertical distance is going to be y2

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:51.520 
vertical distance is going to be y2
minus<00:02:41.150> y1<00:02:43.060> so<00:02:44.060> y2<00:02:44.330> is<00:02:44.600> 2<00:02:45.340> minus<00:02:46.340> negative<00:02:47.560> 3<00:02:50.530> now

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
minus y1 so y2 is 2 minus negative 3 now

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.980 
minus y1 so y2 is 2 minus negative 3 now
as<00:02:51.920> we<00:02:52.160> talked<00:02:52.370> about<00:02:52.459> before<00:02:52.640> a<00:02:53.209> negative

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
as we talked about before a negative

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.050 
as we talked about before a negative
number<00:02:54.190> subtracted<00:02:55.190> because<00:02:55.520> positive

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
number subtracted because positive

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.080 
number subtracted because positive
because<00:02:56.180> two<00:02:56.420> negatives<00:02:56.870> make<00:02:56.870> a<00:02:57.080> positive<00:02:58.090> so

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
because two negatives make a positive so

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.990 
because two negatives make a positive so
this<00:02:59.300> becomes<00:02:59.690> 5<00:03:00.530> so<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.340> distance<00:03:01.490> from<00:03:01.790> here

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
this becomes 5 so the distance from here

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.970 
this becomes 5 so the distance from here
to<00:03:02.090> here<00:03:02.330> is<00:03:02.510> fun<00:03:02.780> now<00:03:03.500> if<00:03:03.590> you<00:03:03.709> go<00:03:03.830> to<00:03:03.890> our

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
to here is fun now if you go to our

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.100 
to here is fun now if you go to our
formula<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:04.760> Pythagorean<00:03:05.420> theorem<00:03:05.780> is<00:03:05.900> this

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
formula the Pythagorean theorem is this

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.220 
formula the Pythagorean theorem is this
now<00:03:06.770> if<00:03:07.430> this<00:03:08.000> simple<00:03:08.660> that<00:03:08.810> they<00:03:08.959> use<00:03:09.200> for

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
now if this simple that they use for

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.699 
now if this simple that they use for

the business for a line between two

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.930 
the business for a line between two
points<00:03:14.600> is<00:03:14.930> leaked<00:03:15.590> so<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:16.489> way<00:03:16.610> you<00:03:16.670> can

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
really x2 minus x1 squared so this

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:34.200 
really x2 minus x1 squared so this

y 2 minus y fun in brackets the whole
thing<00:03:46.360> squared<00:03:46.680> now<00:03:47.680> you<00:03:47.740> really<00:03:48.100> don't<00:03:48.430> want

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640

distance<00:03:48.940> you<00:03:49.570> want<00:03:49.750> distance<00:03:49.960> squared<00:03:50.740> so

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
distance you want distance squared so

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.760 
distance you want distance squared so
what<00:03:51.610> you<00:03:51.730> do<00:03:51.910> is<00:03:51.940> the<00:03:52.810> formula<00:03:53.350> that<00:03:53.650> you

minus x1 squared plus y 2 minus 11

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.930 
minus x1 squared plus y 2 minus 11
switch<00:04:19.859> that's<00:04:20.859> the<00:04:21.010> distance<00:04:21.190> formula<00:04:21.609> and

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
switch that's the distance formula and

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.810 
switch that's the distance formula and
we've<00:04:22.300> figured<00:04:22.540> out<00:04:22.810> what<00:04:23.290> x2<00:04:23.860> minus<00:04:24.010> x1<00:04:24.460> was

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
we've figured out what x2 minus x1 was

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.950 
we've figured out what x2 minus x1 was
which<00:04:25.120> was<00:04:25.200> negative<00:04:26.200> 5<00:04:26.410> minus<00:04:26.650> 2<00:04:27.600> so<00:04:28.600> this<00:04:28.750> can

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
which was negative 5 minus 2 so this can

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.190 
which was negative 5 minus 2 so this can
cause<00:04:30.060> i'm<00:04:31.060> just<00:04:31.270> going<00:04:31.420> to<00:04:31.450> recreate<00:04:31.840> it<00:04:32.020> here

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
cause i'm just going to recreate it here

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.730 
cause i'm just going to recreate it here
so<00:04:32.380> you<00:04:32.440> see<00:04:32.680> how<00:04:32.800> it<00:04:32.919> follows<00:04:33.130> it<00:04:34.120> becomes

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
so you see how it follows it becomes

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.950 
so you see how it follows it becomes
negative<00:04:35.740> 5<00:04:35.980> minus<00:04:36.700> 2<00:04:37.270> squared<00:04:38.100> plus<00:04:39.270> y<00:04:40.270> 2<00:04:40.330> was

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
negative 5 minus 2 squared plus y 2 was

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.320 
negative 5 minus 2 squared plus y 2 was
to<00:04:41.350> y1<00:04:42.130> was<00:04:42.370> negative<00:04:42.730> 3<00:04:43.030> so<00:04:43.720> 2<00:04:43.750> minus<00:04:44.620> negative

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
to y1 was negative 3 so 2 minus negative

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.370 
to y1 was negative 3 so 2 minus negative
3<00:04:46.330> squared<00:04:48.120> negative<00:04:49.120> 5<00:04:49.510> minus<00:04:49.720> 2<00:04:50.110> is<00:04:50.230> negative

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
3 squared negative 5 minus 2 is negative

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:58.380 
3 squared negative 5 minus 2 is negative
7<00:04:50.980> negative<00:04:51.130> 7<00:04:55.470> squared<00:04:56.470> plus<00:04:57.120> negative<00:04:58.120> a

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390 
7 negative 7 squared plus negative a

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:03.270 
7 negative 7 squared plus negative a
negative<00:04:58.419> becomes<00:04:59.050> positive<00:04:59.970> 5<00:05:00.970> squared<00:05:02.280> now

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
negative becomes positive 5 squared now

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.270 
negative becomes positive 5 squared now
negative<00:05:03.760> 7<00:05:04.150> squared<00:05:04.479> I<00:05:04.720> just<00:05:05.710> stated<00:05:05.979> this

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
negative 7 squared I just stated this

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.380 
negative 7 squared I just stated this
that<00:05:06.490> you<00:05:06.580> can<00:05:06.760> have<00:05:06.880> a<00:05:06.940> negative<00:05:07.090> distance

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:07.390 
that you can have a negative distance

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.030 
that you can have a negative distance
but<00:05:07.780> it<00:05:07.810> doesn't<00:05:08.440> really<00:05:08.530> make<00:05:08.740> a<00:05:08.800> difference

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
but it doesn't really make a difference

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.469 
but it doesn't really make a difference
because<00:05:09.430> when<00:05:09.580> you<00:05:09.700> square<00:05:10.030> it<00:05:10.180> it<00:05:10.270> becomes

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 
because when you square it it becomes

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:11.820 
because when you square it it becomes
positive<00:05:11.080> and<00:05:11.200> negative<00:05:11.500> times<00:05:11.680> a<00:05:11.800> negative

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
positive and negative times a negative

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:17.510 
positive and negative times a negative
is<00:05:12.160> positive<00:05:12.250> so<00:05:13.030> negative<00:05:13.479> 7<00:05:13.810> squared<00:05:14.169> is<00:05:16.290> 49

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
is positive so negative 7 squared is 49

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.430 
is positive so negative 7 squared is 49
plus<00:05:18.520> 5<00:05:19.419> squared<00:05:19.450> is<00:05:19.990> 25

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.200 

so<00:05:23.040> the<00:05:23.190> distance<00:05:23.700> is<00:05:23.910> the<00:05:24.450> square<00:05:24.900> root<00:05:26.210> when

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
so the distance is the square root when

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:33.830 
so the distance is the square root when
you<00:05:27.300> will<00:05:27.450> add<00:05:27.600> these<00:05:29.300> 49<00:05:30.300> plus<00:05:31.400> 25<00:05:32.400> 5<00:05:33.240> plus<00:05:33.570> 9

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
you will add these 49 plus 25 5 plus 9

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.590 
you will add these 49 plus 25 5 plus 9
is<00:05:34.080> 14<00:05:34.820> you<00:05:35.820> care<00:05:36.090> to<00:05:36.210> 1<00:05:36.390> up<00:05:36.510> 2<00:05:37.320> plus<00:05:37.620> 4<00:05:38.130> 6<00:05:38.580> plus<00:05:39.390> 1

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
is 14 you care to 1 up 2 plus 4 6 plus 1

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:46.670 
is 14 you care to 1 up 2 plus 4 6 plus 1
is<00:05:39.720> 7<00:05:39.930> so<00:05:40.350> 74<00:05:41.040> so<00:05:41.760> square<00:05:42.180> root<00:05:42.210> of<00:05:43.070> 74<00:05:45.560> so<00:05:46.560> the

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
is 7 so 74 so square root of 74 so the

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.610 
is 7 so 74 so square root of 74 so the
distance<00:05:47.160> between<00:05:47.370> these<00:05:47.820> two<00:05:47.880> points<00:05:48.150> is<00:05:48.840> the

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
distance between these two points is the

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.830 
distance between these two points is the
square<00:05:50.130> root<00:05:50.160> of<00:05:50.340> 74<00:05:50.940> now<00:05:51.360> that's<00:05:51.630> not<00:05:51.780> a

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
square root of 74 now that's not a

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.660 
square root of 74 now that's not a
perfect<00:05:52.110> square<00:05:52.380> so<00:05:52.560> all<00:05:52.920> you<00:05:53.100> do<00:05:53.250> is<00:05:53.370> you<00:05:53.490> use

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:53.670 
perfect square so all you do is you use

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:55.640 
perfect square so all you do is you use
your<00:05:53.820> calculator<00:05:54.060> to<00:05:54.930> figure<00:05:55.140> out<00:05:55.380> what<00:05:55.530> that

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
your calculator to figure out what that

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.130 
your calculator to figure out what that
number<00:05:55.860> is<00:05:56.210> so<00:05:57.210> the<00:05:57.330> distance<00:05:57.690> from<00:05:57.840> here<00:05:58.080> to

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:58.140 
number is so the distance from here to

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.220 
number is so the distance from here to
here<00:05:58.490> let's<00:05:59.490> stick<00:05:59.730> with<00:05:59.760> orange<00:06:00.180> is<00:06:00.960> the

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:01.230 
here let's stick with orange is the

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:05.510 
here let's stick with orange is the
square<00:06:01.620> root<00:06:01.650> of<00:06:02.810> 74<00:06:03.810> okay<00:06:04.440> and<00:06:04.830> that's<00:06:05.370> how

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
square root of 74 okay and that's how

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.100 
square root of 74 okay and that's how
you<00:06:05.610> figure<00:06:05.910> out<00:06:05.970> the<00:06:06.150> three<00:06:06.450> most<00:06:06.630> important

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110 
you figure out the three most important

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.530 
you figure out the three most important
things<00:06:07.140> with<00:06:07.410> lies<00:06:07.650> the<00:06:08.280> slope<00:06:08.610> the<00:06:09.000> midpoint

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:09.540 
things with lies the slope the midpoint

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.590 
things with lies the slope the midpoint
and<00:06:09.780> the<00:06:10.470> distance<00:06:10.890> from<00:06:11.850> there<00:06:12.150> we<00:06:12.270> can<00:06:12.300> walk

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:12.600 
and the distance from there we can walk

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.120 
and the distance from there we can walk
to<00:06:12.810> equation<00:06:13.230> of<00:06:13.320> a<00:06:13.380> line<00:06:13.410> with<00:06:13.710> him<00:06:13.970> good<00:06:14.970> luck
