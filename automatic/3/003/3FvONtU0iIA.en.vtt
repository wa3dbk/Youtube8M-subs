00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 this is one of the girls today I 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:08.820
 found for a tag that will be all 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.500
 internet tolkian bill gates so he 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.809
 it's all about presenting yourself 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.940
 my favorite products of the year 2013 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.920
 so he made me a little late by 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.410
 report to the month of january and that is 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.689
 totally started seeing him almost 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.210
 Completed in fact but I wanted 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.400
 absolutely to present them because 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.170
 that there are really good products 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.789
 obviously I know these are products 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.539
 which I have already spoken to you about 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.130
 throughout the year 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.899
 but I wanted absolutely wanted 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.430
 present in case you missed 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.899
 shoes in jokes or whatever 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.070
 because it's really 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.870
 products that are for me a 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.670
 inescapable finally it's really but 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.440
 must of the year 2013 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.420
 so I wanted to introduce them to you and 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.190
 I hope this video will please you in 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.910
 first in my favorites this year 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.579
 2013 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.350
 there is the m23 perfect from bourjois 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.780
 so it's really a foundation that 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.480
 I loved it and still love it 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.730
 I would always love I think because 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.469
 it is true that it is very beautiful 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.220
 dyed when you know how to choose its hue 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.720
 obviously and so I had it in mind 54 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.960
 but suddenly what were earlier 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.000
 still went up from 7 in October and I 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.070
 beg a little clearer of the hue 50.2 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.770
 for this winter and frankly to me goes 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.600
 great warm it's just a pretty 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.610
 dyed and cynical as one could 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.460
 you doubt I could not not 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.979
 tell you about the year case all that's 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.610
 really a must have this year 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.880
 2013 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.979
 and obviously I will continue to 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.829
 use it all this year I 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:38.700
 think because even though I had there is not 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.990
 than 3 to Christmas it's really I think 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.090
 that they complement each other anyway 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.200
 So this one is a bit much 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.060
 dark is very very pretty so I think 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.500
 that I will continue to associate the two 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.090
 to continue in the mmy cap 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.810
 there are highline and hours of home 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.659
 nature reserve so it's simple 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.909
 a felt eyeliner that I discovered at 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.110
 the end of the year precisely so I 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.270
 not had the opportunity to use during 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.130
 all year but the little that I have 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.070
 used during the year 2013 I the 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.810
 adores and he's really great so if 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.819
 you are looking for a game you their great 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.760
 strongly all this year I also 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:15.430
 used the theatrical mascara of 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.780
 at bourjois so he has two sides so 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.160
 I can open it a white side as 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.510
 this is really to lengthen 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.890
 eyelashes and another black side precisely 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.750
 to color the six black hours and 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.790
 to lengthen them even more we knew 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.920
 really my crush erected 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.380
 obviously loved blush babies from home 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.330
 natural blizzard again it's really 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.950
 been my favorite for blushes 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.349
 because blue luck tic 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.530
 I really always had a hard time 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:46.959
 frankly and this one these struggles for 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:51.250
 continue on the blush and all that I 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:53.470
 also loved the talk of love at home 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.900
 so for those who did not 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.299
 not seen she looks like this with 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.579
 a bluff side and a rather brothers side 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.260
 so really it's also a shot of 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:02.859
 heart of this year especially this summer 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.959
 2013 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:07.060
 then as you already know I 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.859
 loved the baby him this year 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.220
 but also it existed since very very 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:11.380
 long time 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.030
 in the usa for example it's true 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.430
 that they only came out in France 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.410
 this year and fresh years was a but 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.870
 big favorite also especially 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.319
 besides I'm not going here but my 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.269
 prefer 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:25.359
 it was certainly the star 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:27.970
 it's the one that is a yellow packaging 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:29.920
 and oranges and that's really the one that 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:34.090
 drac the most it is he liked me the most 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.350
 in among all every baby then 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.630
 I have a cream that I used 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.489
 all year is the critical night 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.019
 intense rock-posay I will not be able 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.940
 now not do without it I lé couvert 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.799
 this year and frankly I look at ne 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.150
 not have discovered it to see because 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.500
 frankly it's a very good cream 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.209
 and besides if you have problems 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.930
 of eczema especially on the face or 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.760
 on your eyelids 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.010
 I really recommend this cream because 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.810
 that she works miracles and your skin 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.700
 after the really drier ever 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.660
 fed just right for 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.370
 continue in the creams there is 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.010
 five rockets in the Occitan that I have 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.420
 really loved it too I have it 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.720
 often spoken it seems to me 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.850
 so its smell is just perfect not the 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.710
 all heady and it feeds extremely 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.610
 good hands if you tend to 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.160
 to have dry hands 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.870
 then I told you several 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.239
 times so this is the scented mist 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.600
 moonlight cloud at victoria's 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.910
 quilts 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.280
 it's really my big favorite at 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.170
 perfume level for seven years 2013 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.620
 and I can today in the past 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:32.120
 see with a diminished and that's it I 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.310
 will continue to use during this 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.690
 year 2014 also I can not wait to use it 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.170
 especially in the spring that I shit 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:42.740
 secret victoria's i loved too much 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:47.210
 the body scrub so pretty sony 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.870
 bright in perfume love love so that's 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.940
 really b1 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.430
 it is a texture but of tinqueux you 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.500
 do not even imagine that's the kind but 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.840
 the impression of starting to put 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.300
 sand on the skin or not sand 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.680
 but sugar and when we when we 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.140
 install like that on the skin account 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.730
 rubs it ceases suddenly blow and that 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.280
 becomes soft it is just but 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:10.250
 awesome and smell but my god the smell 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.290
 but she is right but no it smells 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.460
 really too much montsalès a height 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.680
 which the whole bathroom when we 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.900
 the used paul there i'm really too 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.460
 too much do not even imagine you at the end 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.350
 of the year 2013 I have the chance to 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.960
 discover the brushes of the brand you 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:28.700
 he goes and I must say that frankly 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:29.960
 me they are just great this one 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.960
 certainly you prefer so 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.280
 it's the buffer so genetically 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.310
 childish with that now and also 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.320
 for the bluff I use these two there and 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.060
 are really too much top 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.890
 this year at lush I had 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.680
 the opportunity to buy the fact of snow 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:47.630
 so frankly if he wanted to 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.550
 shampoo that centers on the mount that smells 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.350
 cotton candy that are but just but 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.960
 me it's not really affordable not 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.790
 I will not say it but it smells good 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.180
 That's good 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:06:00.100
 the sweet is just huge but if you 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.840
 have never had the opportunity to test it 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.760
 frankly try to test it because 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.160
 that it is really but too good 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.020
 sure it's a limited edition of christmas i 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.810
 do not know if we will still have this 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.640
 year but next year we put 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:15.040
 November syndromes ran in the 

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:17.410
 boxes and buy this stuff it smells 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:20.260
 really way too good and so there is 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:22.870
 also does the lips of the egg they 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:25.840
 are exactly the same as the shower gel 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:27.400
 and frankly but it's just too much 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.110
 all too well because when we have 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.370
 little skins on the lips or what there 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.500
 will actually you just take 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:35.080
 like that elf rossi gets up and his 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:37.570
 imminent peeled kind of inspector you 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.830
 go on happiness of all and must 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:40.510
 to do from time to time it's really 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:42.370
 very very good it's a very good exclude 

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:44.290
 to finish I will tell you about 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:47.320
 varnish obviously they have a little 

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:49.480
 rocked my opinion 2013 and so there is a 

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:51.400
 first leblanc dissipate a little him 

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.020
 best white that can exist at 

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.520
 world and he is really in the pack 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.830
 largely in two layers 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.840
 and here I love them this summer at 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:01.770
 spring I did not stop putting the 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:04.810
 short flosse common it really is 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:06.790
 too top as allowed especially when he 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:09.670
 it's new, it's really 

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:11.550
 of color magnify and finally this winter 

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:14.860
 and this autumn I did not stop putting 

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:16.030
 the blair of the brand zoe is it's 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.090
 I really think it's my mark of 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:21.850
 anyway favorite way of polish it has a 

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:25.090
 color but suddenly we know it's a 

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:28.060
 very deep red with wines a little 

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:29.890
 but metallized too much too beautiful it
