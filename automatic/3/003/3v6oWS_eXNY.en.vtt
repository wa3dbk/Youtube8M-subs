00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 Hello youtube and welcome to one 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.180
 new technology found her video 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.690
 today there is something more 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.610
 more unusual video 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.559
 because with me something behind the 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.870
 backdrops done in fashion as well 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.120
 I make my videos a new camera 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.160
 no of course not a new mac no 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.890
 that too, it just did not work out 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.210
 something done on my video software and 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.070
 I would like to talk to you about this 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.990
 There are two points of the heart because I am 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.359
 lie that your video is rather oriented 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.090
 to people who still cut with imovie 9 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.450
 and have an old computer like me 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.760
 my macbook air is from mid-2011 so 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.800
 now good four years old has one more 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.300
 old ii 5 i believe one with the 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.200
 first only has four gigabytes 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.820
 random access memory 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.770
 if somebody asks why I am 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.039
 not great duper cut videos make 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.059
 or vga videos so without that and 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.320
 because I, of course, that my money the 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.820
 not like the new mac strength but 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.570
 rather what I test then but test 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.489
 that only on the edge 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.430
 that's why I have the whole thing 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.410
 time continues with imovie new cut 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.719
 Two years ago, one thumb came 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.829
 mobi 10 out but that has a few na 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.559
 yes that brings problems in the 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.290
 workflow or how I do it 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.600
 call jerky cutting and booming 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.470
 so fan around so now with you 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.670
 step by step 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.200
 go through 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.509
 As I said it really depends 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.939
 a niche group you always have three 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.680
 points in the video actually make in 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.270
 this imovie cut program what 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.420
 apple everywhere is free 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.780
 number one import number two 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.460
 cut and export number 3 and 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.689
 I have a little post it now 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.020
 made a note we go now but 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.369
 short by and usually 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.990
 I filmed my video have the sd 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.630
 card in the calculator in it and then only 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.009
 imported times that looks natural 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.450
 I do not want to go back graphically 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.369
 to a movie 9 if you look at that 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.220
 has gotten used to ten times and we are doing now 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.750
 Just let me have a ten minute walk 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.670
 videofile filmed so I have one 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.720
 video file this for ten minutes and 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.740
 I want that now I would now 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.229
 want to import 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.700
 that would be up with my old computer 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.590
 Of course, this can also be done by new computers 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.030
 even older still go faster 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.680
 weaker computers take so much 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.570
 Of course, even longer, but I'll take 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.640
 just think about it for now 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.350
 comparison for the comparative values 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.060
 he would import it on mine 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.340
 from a ten minute video now exactly 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.170
 ten minutes so take factor so 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.209
 one to one 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.280
 minute video import one minute 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.290
 So we keep ten minutes 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.780
 in these ten minutes becomes the fan 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.940
 turn up that the airport atmosphere 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.590
 he gives gas 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.300
 after this ten minutes is the video 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.700
 now imported and now I can here 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.220
 normally edit the cut 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.569
 it works smoothly without any change 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.510
 I do not jerk and when 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.650
 cutting is the computer quietly but 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.510
 if I say ten right now 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.800
 minutes of video at the cutting not much 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.780
 I need ten minutes to cut 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.860
 I skim over the video we do 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.840
 Just ten minutes then I am 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.810
 already over 20 minutes and then 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.030
 the video will be exported in step 3 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.640
 it takes me a long time that is right 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.760
 so factor five to six so for ten 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.489
 minutes of video something from 50 to 60 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.819
 minutes the thing then exported and 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:05.400
 I have airport atmosphere again 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.510
 So why that's really loud there 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.330
 you can not be in the same room at all 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.850
 come with my old macbook so now 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.950
 As an alternative we upgrade to one 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.569
 movie 10 what look different where you look 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.609
 First of all, oh god thinks bad 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.019
 bad bad bad but many 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:20.579
 Above all, one can have advantages 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.200
 insertions or regulations to 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.660
 any place in the timeline 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.890
 push and not only not only 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.420
 cut the video and then always on 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.640
 beginning since the submission is that 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.049
 a horrible one is the new imovie ten 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.540
 really better 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.820
 But it also has working problems 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.040
 expiration and that we import again 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.680
 quite normal ours now over another 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.180
 symbol we now have import and there 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.910
 we would just go and 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.660
 our ten minutes video again 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.480
 import 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.600
 the funny thing about it but it takes then 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.100
 do not import that for just a minute 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.200
 we see only one in an obi 9 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.209
 But then you only have me 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.950
 my raw copy of the 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.019
 preview version of your thing the 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.180
 Data are all on it but if you do that 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:05.970
 then edited or in the timeline 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.920
 push to cut then yours 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.359
 computer active then you can run that 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.430
 not liquid to cut then you have 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:13.620
 her really slideshow at the very beginning 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.739
 that will get better the whole time 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.060
 Time I say while her tailor 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:20.010
 cut calculates your calculator i say 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.640
 times the files for the race already there 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.440
 funny hardworking employee and i say 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.660
 cutting it is a pain 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.620
 in the first few minutes really a qual 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.790
 after that he has a bit 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.500
 captured a bit already 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.790
 calculated or something like that then it works 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.900
 but then you still have slideshow 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.030
 on older computers 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.070
 that is how he cuts your time 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.300
 not more ten minutes because that too 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.120
 liquid against but now just times 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.280
 15 minutes from me and 20 minutes 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.020
 the problem of cutting is no more 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.970
 so fluid and your computer will be back 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.340
 Not quite as loud as we are so loud 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.170
 we are used to export from 9 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.510
 but he is loud making that cut 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.490
 not so much fun if you are 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.170
 but now for the third step comes 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.270
 It is now really cool again 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.830
 because we just had export factor 5 to 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:06.600
 6 and now we only have the 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:08.400
 export factor 1 to 2 and that's it 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.990
 so fast for that now in a short time 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.070
 on to add, I've now 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.930
 Conservative calculated at the old imovie 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:18.210
 takes an account to rent minutes 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.520
 export video import cutting 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.770
 pi times thumb 70 minutes 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.860
 of those 70 minutes is the mac then 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:28.710
 60 minutes in turbo mode and power 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:31.740
 green with imovie 10 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.970
 you only need 36 minutes to 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.230
 export from the whole 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.210
 or for the whole process 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:38.730
 So really only half 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.770
 and the thing is then only of 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:43.080
 me out on simple only on 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.930
 only half of the time starts at the beginning 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.210
 loud and yes we are now coming out absolutely 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.830
 I want to import that and it is 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.660
 cutting is not so nice anymore 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.910
 if you want to do it directly but the 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:56.280
 complete workload is around 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.050
 some less only half 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.910
 much like you all your old carrots 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.830
 burdened so and above all there is 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.030
 still the trick you can watch the video 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.800
 have imported into the now 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.960
 pack timeline and then render the 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.669
 Once over then he will be loud again 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.590
 the time you can käffchen 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:12.450
 Drink at five minutes ten minutes 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:14.190
 then he usually has finished himself 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.840
 once done and then you can 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.160
 again seamlessly cut fast 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.570
 but even if you are there 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.460
 another ten minutes on it packs on 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.210
 these 35 minutes even if it's 50 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.880
 minutes are 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.260
 you still save 20 minutes yours 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.169
 Calculator does not have to be that much anymore 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:30.409
 work you have a nicer one 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:33.259
 Imovie atmosphere like I think and there 

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:34.999
 I would once again very briefly say 

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:36.259
 have this change of imovie new on 

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:38.270
 a ruby ​​count in the last three 

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:39.229
 made up to four months consistently 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.029
 not on a new one anymore 

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:42.830
 would change back to now 

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:44.300
 do not want to switch back any case 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.689
 I'm glad that I did it to him 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:50.180
 a buffet 10 is so many nice things 

00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:52.490
 this or workflows themselves at 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.590
 my skimmer drill video 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:56.389
 Cutting technology and display technology 

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:59.419
 have simplified life 

00:06:56.389 --> 00:07:00.740
 I do not want to go back so that 

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:01.969
 it should have been that was 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.169
