00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.910
 Welcome to SBCU. 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.820
 We'll talk about the brand new Tarmac. 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.284
 The tarmac is your complete racing bike. 

00:00:15.284 --> 00:00:17.450
 And you really have to think about it completely differently. 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.520
 We want a bike that climbs that rises and that 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.220
 manages well for you. 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.220
 That means just how big or small you are, 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.970
 where your center of gravity is, this bike is built for you. 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.595
 So we have to talk about rider first development, something of 

00:00:33.595 --> 00:00:36.844
 the integration that we have done on the Tarmacen, and just any of 

00:00:36.844 --> 00:00:38.360
 my favorite parts and pieces on it. 

00:00:43.967 --> 00:00:47.040
 So rider first development is exactly what it sounds like. 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.310
 It's the development of the bike around the rider. 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.730
 And when we look at better ways to make the Tarmac even better, 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.529
 We really had to focus on not just that one 

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:59.057
 medium sized rider, no, we had to look at all 

00:00:59.057 --> 00:01:00.150
 different sizes of riders. 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.010
 And we spent a lot of time making dynamic, reality 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.750
 tests to see how a Tarmac would go under 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.100
 riders of different sizes. 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.280
 And what we realized was that we wouldn't build a new tarmac. 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.410
 We actually wanted to build seven new tarmacs. 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.246
 So these frames are all developed around the center of gravity 

00:01:19.246 --> 00:01:23.060
 And the way different size riders will actually run 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.820
 on their bikes. 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.578
 Ultimately, you get the best control, sprint, climb 

00:01:28.578 --> 00:01:31.547
 Tarmac for the way you ride. 

00:01:31.547 --> 00:01:34.598
 So when you look at the frames, you will notice that 

00:01:34.598 --> 00:01:37.158
 the crown tube size, the fork size, especially downward 

00:01:37.158 --> 00:01:41.538
 The tube depends on whether the bike is for a smaller rider, perhaps one 

00:01:41.538 --> 00:01:46.520
 49, or a higher rider, like a 61 then you will see mega 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.420
 Differences in the way the pipes are constructed all with 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.550
 The goal is to get a Tarmac that controls the same way 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:55.320
 kind of riders. 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.600
 Then development first rides, never done before. 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.970
 A new Tarmac is actually 7 new frames. 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.310
 And they all control amazingly. 

00:02:09.484 --> 00:02:12.365
 When you drive on the new Tarmac, you will notice it 

00:02:12.365 --> 00:02:15.802
 Not just controls, and runs like a dream, it also looks 

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:16.440
 great looking. 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.260
 And part of it comes from the integration on this bike. 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.394
 You will notice that the headset is super integrated, much 

00:02:22.394 --> 00:02:22.980
 slim down here. 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.341
 And it all has internal cabling and a real one 

00:02:27.341 --> 00:02:30.130
 interesting new style of seat clamps. 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.830
 When you look at it, you can't even see it, completely 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.406
 integrated in the seat tube. 

00:02:34.406 --> 00:02:35.500
 Good way to do it. 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.648
 Keeps it hidden, but also keeps the seat position exactly 

00:02:37.648 --> 00:02:38.958
 where you need it. 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.040
 So for me, the devil is in the details. 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.232
 And there are a few specific parts here that I think are 

00:02:50.232 --> 00:02:50.780
 extra cool. 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.710
 First thing is bum disc brakes. 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.690
 Disc brakes on a racing bike? 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.040
 It's actually super fat. 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.090
 They are powerful. 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.290
 They are consistent. 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.697
 And we have options on the tarmac, disc brakes or 

00:03:00.697 --> 00:03:02.499
 No disc brakes, no matter what we have. 

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:04.290
 But you should definitely give them a try. 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.247
 Roval wheels, these are the CLX 40s. 

00:03:07.247 --> 00:03:08.580
 That means they are not too high. 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:09.496
 But they are not too short either. 

00:03:09.496 --> 00:03:11.800
 It's a good wheel set all around. 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.550
 They are easy. 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:13.360
 They're stiff. 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.280
 Perfectly suited to the Tarmac style. 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.724
 We have pressfit bottom fittings and, of course, body 

00:03:19.724 --> 00:03:20.600
 geometric saddles. 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.873
 Body geometry keeps getting the blood there 

00:03:22.873 --> 00:03:23.889
 You must have blood. 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:25.430
 You will be happy on the bike. 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.013
 You will be happy when you are not on the bike. 

00:03:27.013 --> 00:03:30.270
 Work, really cool piece to wear on your new Tarmac. 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:31.625
 The bike has all the good things. 

00:03:31.625 --> 00:03:32.730
 It's faster. 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.040
 It runs better than any bike we've made before. 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.690
 Visit your local specialized store. 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.630
