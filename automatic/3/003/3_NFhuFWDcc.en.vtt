red lipstick on the inside so that's

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.780

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
look in the mirrors at the same time so

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.500 
look in the mirrors at the same time so
I<00:03:59.730> don't<00:03:59.910> know<00:04:00.000> what<00:04:00.120> color<00:04:00.300> this<00:04:00.570> is<00:04:00.810> a<00:04:01.160> look

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
I don't know what color this is a look

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.910 
I don't know what color this is a look
so<00:04:03.510> it's<00:04:03.630> just<00:04:03.720> like<00:04:03.810> a<00:04:03.900> ready<00:04:04.230> color<00:04:04.560> and<00:04:04.860> i'm
