00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 every smartphone has its own lifespan 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.759
 in the market it depends on several 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.440
 factors and most often make up one 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.450
 year or even less but this if not 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.759
 take sony into account with its plan 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.960
 you give the flagship once a month not at all 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.940
 I know why I'm telling you all this 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.310
 probably in order to somehow 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.869
 justify myself because now I will be you 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.119
 talk about the smartphone that was 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.890
 presented at the end of last year 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.289
 joke about the latest review in 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.939
 the internet has somehow become shorter 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.189
 meet this highscreen 2 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.679
 and he has this screen where 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.540
 you can conveniently and most importantly quickly 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.540
 view the most necessary information 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.149
 cedar approves 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.899
 the first thing you notice in 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.420
 in this case it is design he 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:34.430
 really attracted i would say he 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.289
 not good not bad he just not such 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.509
 like everyone's cool home button 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:40.039
 which serves as an indicator of notifications and 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.350
 charging gives extra screen 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:49.220
 add unusual device but 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:50.600
 i have one question as thanks 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.060
 even slots for sim cards on the left side 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.740
 made under the line therefore recommend 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.189
 look at the smartphone with this particular 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.350
 parties 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.060
 constantly and here what I want 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.350
 praise the engineers so much for the quality 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.420
 Build it here is really very 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.220
 good and honestly for a long time this is not 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.049
 met nothing creaks at all 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.700
 backlash there is not even a hint of it more 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.590
 Moreover, the frame protrudes slightly above the glass 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.180
 so there is hope if the smartphone 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.709
 will fall face down 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.269
 he will not break as regards 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.549
 directly to the display itself then it 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:18.049
 here 4 7 inch has resolution and 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:20.360
 Dzhigit proceeding from this density 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:22.549
 It turns out 312 dpi matrix 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.319
 here by the way a and ps viewing angles are good 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:25.160
 but when you turn the display to the left 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.840
 a little yellow 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.310
 especially noticeable on white 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.750
 background for example in a browser 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.880
 website automatic brightness adjustment 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.769
 are present and it works enough 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.570
 adequately I said that under the screen 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.489
 There is a button home work is also 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.470
 indicator but if the second point which 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.299
 a little annoying shortcut keys 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.880
 menu and back are doted 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.829
 just dots so the first time 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.780
 communicating with a smartphone reminds 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:49.910
 some random game in terms of photos and 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.430
 video features highscreen of 2 most 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.220
 present three days used here 13 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.470
 megapixel sony imx230 module with 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.299
 diaphragm 18 when it comes to something easier 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.769
 You can take food on Instagram 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.230
 here on the tool with him of course not 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.519
 you will laugh at the link a little harder 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.769
 front camera only 2 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.630
 megapixels but experienced people know what 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.609
 important thing is not the number of megapixels and 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.889
 the ability to use them video can 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:14.389
 shoot maximum up to 1080p 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:16.579
 In the settings there is an opportunity to set 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:18.109
 white rice balance or choose one of 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:20.420
 several standard presets 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:22.730
 portrait sport and so on in general a of 2 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.680
 was once the flagship of the company therefore 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.810
 we can assume that the stuffing is here on 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.220
 proper level in principle the way it is 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.250
 device got its order 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.230
 mediatek mt6592 processor 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.870
 This is an 8-core chip that works on 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.090
 the clock frequency of 1 of 7 GHz operational 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.590
 2 gigabytes of internal memory 16 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.870
 as I said before there is a card slot 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.140
 micro sd memory for cool graphics in 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.269
 games meets accelerator mali 450 mp4 and 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.190
 once we are talking about the games then the smartphone 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.840
 heats up nothing critical about it 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.860
 this is almost all modern sin 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.690
 devices 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.840
 but because of the words from the title I 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.459
 there was some dissonance at all with 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.950
 iron offers copes well 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.060
 with trigger 2 goes by default with low 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.890
 graphics settings 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.810
 but even with average parameters everything 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.670
 works cool a similar situation with 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.590
 modern combat 5 asphalt 8 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.090
 I was also very pleased with that moment 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.160
 what's in the world of tanks on highscreen 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.049
 of 2 work even better than that of 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.030
 Some flagship for me personally is 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.410
 indicative moment tests the situation 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.200
 next in antutu smartphone dials 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.750
 32,000 parrots and nenamark2 gives out more 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.820
 60 frames per second 3d mark almost 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.530
 5 thousand points but who is not so 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.150
 okay rather naked android this 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.410
 certainly cool but not when he 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.479
 version 442 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.500
 and the most annoying that flare pop is not even 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:35.360
 custom firmware 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.220
 as for this second screen then 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.530
 I can't call him too useful 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.510
 yes it shows time date weather name 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.160
 the caller but the good of it, I do not particularly 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.200
 I see it is always possible anyway 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.850
 Turn off the setting item called 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.990
 Oleg with autonomy everything is enough 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.090
 trite before us is typical 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.070
 representative of android devices it 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.080
 2500 milliamp hour battery 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.610
 enough for exactly the day of use it 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.200
 in normal mode there twitter 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.800
 read mail check a little 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.750
 to talk 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.789
 if you strain your smartphone 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.500
 heavy games or drink bunnies then 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:05.150
 after three or four hours have of how 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.560
 Charger well and now the 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.660
 main price for highscreen 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.240
 and from 2 the manufacturer asks about 300 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.099
 dollars and it is about 7000 grip 6 700 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.050
 to be precise, well, reasoning on 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:17.960
 the topic is justified this dream book or not i 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.760
 I leave to you that I want to mention 4 7 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.950
 inch display is still cool 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.720
 because phablets do not all need well 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.030
 running line on the back side straight 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:29.570
 as in the trolleybus, this is also a feature 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.350
 they are planted given let everything be by 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:35.260
 route 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:35.260
 could well again the final stop
