00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.640 
stuff and I feel like just going simple
is<00:03:12.639> what<00:03:12.939> is<00:03:13.060> effective<00:03:13.569> now<00:03:13.750> when<00:03:14.230> I<00:03:14.260> was<00:03:14.439> kind

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
is what is effective now when I was kind

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.170 
is what is effective now when I was kind
of<00:03:14.739> struggling<00:03:15.010> I<00:03:15.250> did<00:03:15.609> have<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:15.849> middle<00:03:16.030> of

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
of struggling I did have the middle of

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.550 
of struggling I did have the middle of
the<00:03:16.269> free<00:03:16.480> as<00:03:16.599> a<00:03:16.629> bull<00:03:16.900> winning<00:03:17.139> midfielder

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
the free as a bull winning midfielder

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.960 
the free as a bull winning midfielder
but<00:03:17.709> as<00:03:17.979> we<00:03:18.129> kind<00:03:18.340> of<00:03:18.430> got<00:03:18.519> better<00:03:18.729> and<00:03:18.849> more

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
but as we kind of got better and more

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.550 
but as we kind of got better and more
expansive<00:03:19.269> and<00:03:19.599> played<00:03:19.780> a<00:03:19.810> better<00:03:20.019> passing

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
expansive and played a better passing

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.379 
expansive and played a better passing
game<00:03:20.769> I<00:03:20.919> feel<00:03:21.280> like<00:03:21.430> central<00:03:21.819> midfielder<00:03:22.209> all

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:22.389 
game I feel like central midfielder all

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:24.000 
game I feel like central midfielder all
free<00:03:22.690> as<00:03:22.780> automatic<00:03:23.349> is<00:03:23.530> effective

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
free as automatic is effective

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.770 
free as automatic is effective
occasionally<00:03:24.489> if<00:03:24.639> DeMaria<00:03:25.269> comes<00:03:25.540> on<00:03:25.690> in

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
occasionally if DeMaria comes on in

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.509 
occasionally if DeMaria comes on in
center<00:03:26.019> mid<00:03:26.169> say<00:03:26.379> comes<00:03:26.680> on<00:03:26.859> on<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.129> left<00:03:27.340> I

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
center mid say comes on on the left I

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.189 
center mid say comes on on the left I
will<00:03:27.970> switch<00:03:28.329> him<00:03:28.479> to<00:03:28.629> like<00:03:28.780> an<00:03:28.930> advanced

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:29.199 
will switch him to like an advanced

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:30.839 
will switch him to like an advanced
playmaker<00:03:29.680> support<00:03:30.190> or<00:03:30.310> something<00:03:30.579> like<00:03:30.639> that

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
playmaker support or something like that

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:33.119 
playmaker support or something like that
but<00:03:30.970> in<00:03:31.090> general<00:03:31.449> I<00:03:31.569> usually<00:03:32.199> go<00:03:32.379> for<00:03:32.409> the<00:03:32.769> free

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:33.129 
but in general I usually go for the free

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.280 
but in general I usually go for the free
central<00:03:33.879> midfielders<00:03:34.389> on<00:03:34.540> automatic<00:03:35.109> and

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
central midfielders on automatic and

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.839 
central midfielders on automatic and
then<00:03:35.530> I<00:03:35.560> have<00:03:35.799> two<00:03:36.040> inside<00:03:36.400> forwards<00:03:36.729> on

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
then I have two inside forwards on

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:38.729 
then I have two inside forwards on
support<00:03:37.239> and<00:03:37.419> an<00:03:37.750> advanced<00:03:38.139> forward<00:03:38.470> on

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
support and an advanced forward on

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.399 
support and an advanced forward on
attack<00:03:39.250> now<00:03:39.489> this<00:03:40.329> is<00:03:40.510> so<00:03:40.720> good<00:03:40.959> in<00:03:41.109> the<00:03:41.199> fact

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:41.409 
attack now this is so good in the fact

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:43.979 
attack now this is so good in the fact
that<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:42.430> wingers<00:03:42.729> do<00:03:42.940> end<00:03:43.090> up<00:03:43.209> chipping<00:03:43.900> in

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
that the wingers do end up chipping in

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.300 
that the wingers do end up chipping in
with<00:03:44.019> goals<00:03:44.319> I<00:03:44.470> mean<00:03:44.620> Julian<00:03:44.919> Bryan<00:03:45.129> here

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
with goals I mean Julian Bryan here

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.500 
with goals I mean Julian Bryan here
wasn't<00:03:45.459> actually<00:03:45.940> quite<00:03:46.150> as<00:03:46.239> good<00:03:46.389> as<00:03:46.449> I

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
wasn't actually quite as good as I

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:47.729 
wasn't actually quite as good as I
expect<00:03:46.810> him<00:03:46.930> to<00:03:46.959> be<00:03:47.049> was<00:03:47.290> still<00:03:47.500> useful

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
expect him to be was still useful

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.680 
expect him to be was still useful
Phillips<00:03:48.250> here<00:03:48.370> got<00:03:48.519> 17<00:03:48.970> goals<00:03:49.239> that's<00:03:49.449> really

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
Phillips here got 17 goals that's really

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.659 
Phillips here got 17 goals that's really
solid<00:03:49.959> and<00:03:50.229> on<00:03:50.440> ganda<00:03:50.769> obviously<00:03:51.159> becomes<00:03:51.519> the

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:51.669 
solid and on ganda obviously becomes the

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:53.099 
solid and on ganda obviously becomes the
showpiece<00:03:52.090> Bonnie<00:03:52.389> did<00:03:52.599> pretty<00:03:52.780> well<00:03:52.870> as<00:03:53.079> well

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
showpiece Bonnie did pretty well as well

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:55.050 
showpiece Bonnie did pretty well as well
to<00:03:53.319> pick<00:03:53.440> up<00:03:53.560> 12<00:03:53.769> goals<00:03:54.010> when<00:03:54.459> he<00:03:54.549> was<00:03:54.699> needed

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
to pick up 12 goals when he was needed

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.789 
to pick up 12 goals when he was needed
so<00:03:55.209> in<00:03:55.329> that<00:03:55.449> regard<00:03:55.840> it's<00:03:56.109> really<00:03:56.560> simple

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
so in that regard it's really simple

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:58.319 
so in that regard it's really simple
guys<00:03:57.040> but<00:03:57.250> I<00:03:57.280> found<00:03:57.489> it<00:03:57.639> to<00:03:57.699> be<00:03:57.729> so<00:03:57.909> effective

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
guys but I found it to be so effective
