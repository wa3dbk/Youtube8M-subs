hello welcome back for part 9 of this
series<00:00:04.920> on<00:00:05.100> creating<00:00:05.279> games<00:00:05.700> using<00:00:05.910> construct

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
series on creating games using construct

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.220 
series on creating games using construct
2<00:00:06.690> in<00:00:06.950> part<00:00:07.950> 8<00:00:08.160> we<00:00:08.519> added<00:00:08.940> a<00:00:09.120> timer<00:00:09.570> to<00:00:09.870> our<00:00:09.990> game

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
2 in part 8 we added a timer to our game

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.110 
2 in part 8 we added a timer to our game
so<00:00:10.679> again<00:00:10.950> our<00:00:11.070> game<00:00:11.280> we're<00:00:11.730> jumping<00:00:12.030> around

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
so again our game we're jumping around

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.839 
so again our game we're jumping around
on<00:00:12.389> these<00:00:12.509> platforms<00:00:13.170> that<00:00:13.259> are<00:00:13.469> moving<00:00:13.860> we're

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
on these platforms that are moving we're

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.910 
on these platforms that are moving we're
dodging<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.420> bullets<00:00:15.750> from<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.049> turret<00:00:16.289> we

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
dodging the bullets from the turret we

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.010 
dodging the bullets from the turret we
get<00:00:17.130> points<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.789> longer<00:00:18.119> we<00:00:18.270> survive<00:00:18.600> and

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
get points the longer we survive and

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.500 
get points the longer we survive and
then<00:00:19.859> now<00:00:20.010> we<00:00:20.070> added<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.609> timer<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:21.090> our<00:00:21.150> game<00:00:21.359> as

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
then now we added a timer to our game as

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.689 
then now we added a timer to our game as
well<00:00:21.660> so<00:00:21.840> we<00:00:21.960> can<00:00:21.990> only<00:00:22.230> play<00:00:22.470> four<00:00:22.830> I<00:00:23.189> think<00:00:23.609> we

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
well so we can only play four I think we

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.460 
well so we can only play four I think we
had<00:00:23.850> 10<00:00:24.090> seconds<00:00:24.539> in<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.689> previous<00:00:25.019> example

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
had 10 seconds in the previous example

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.529 
had 10 seconds in the previous example
so<00:00:26.310> what<00:00:26.519> we're<00:00:26.640> going<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.820> talk<00:00:27.000> about<00:00:27.029> in

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
so what we're going to talk about in

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.929 
so what we're going to talk about in
this<00:00:28.050> video<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.740> adding<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.220> start<00:00:29.490> screen<00:00:29.640> so

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
this video is adding a start screen so

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.460 
this video is adding a start screen so
right<00:00:30.119> now<00:00:30.240> we<00:00:30.300> just<00:00:30.480> have<00:00:30.810> that<00:00:30.990> one<00:00:31.050> game

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
right now we just have that one game

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.740 
right now we just have that one game
screen<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:32.250> any<00:00:32.460> time<00:00:32.730> we<00:00:32.910> lose<00:00:33.090> if<00:00:33.450> we<00:00:33.570> hit<00:00:33.690> a

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
screen and any time we lose if we hit a

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.569 
screen and any time we lose if we hit a
bullet<00:00:33.989> or<00:00:34.290> fall<00:00:34.530> off<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.920> fall<00:00:35.309> off<00:00:35.460> the

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
bullet or fall off the fall off the

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.450 
bullet or fall off the fall off the
screen<00:00:36.230> we<00:00:37.230> just<00:00:37.469> restart<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.010> layout<00:00:38.250> but

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
screen we just restart the layout but

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.069 
screen we just restart the layout but
now<00:00:38.579> we<00:00:38.640> want<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.969> actually<00:00:39.120> go<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.750> start

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
now we want to actually go to a start

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.780 
now we want to actually go to a start
screen<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:40.920> let's<00:00:41.219> go<00:00:41.340> ahead<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.579> get<00:00:41.670> started

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
screen so let's go ahead and get started

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.569 
screen so let's go ahead and get started
so<00:00:43.520> in<00:00:44.520> construct<00:00:45.000> 2<00:00:45.210> any<00:00:45.989> kind<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.680> levels<00:00:47.280> or

let's double click add another text and

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:25.259 
let's double click add another text and
call<00:03:20.590> it<00:03:20.769> play<00:03:22.139> button<00:03:23.699> now<00:03:24.699> this<00:03:24.819> might<00:03:25.060> seem

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
call it play button now this might seem

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:26.909 
call it play button now this might seem
a<00:03:25.329> little<00:03:25.389> confusing<00:03:25.629> because<00:03:26.169> there<00:03:26.440> is<00:03:26.620> a

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:26.919 
a little confusing because there is a

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:30.360 
a little confusing because there is a
button<00:03:27.760> here<00:03:28.079> there<00:03:29.079> is<00:03:29.260> a<00:03:29.290> button<00:03:29.650> object<00:03:29.859> but

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
button here there is a button object but

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.580 
button here there is a button object but
it's<00:03:30.519> not<00:03:30.699> as<00:03:30.909> customizable<00:03:31.810> as<00:03:31.930> a<00:03:32.109> text

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
it's not as customizable as a text

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.069 
it's not as customizable as a text
object<00:03:32.709> so<00:03:33.040> that's<00:03:33.159> why<00:03:33.310> I<00:03:33.340> use<00:03:33.519> the<00:03:33.669> text

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
object so that's why I use the text

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.729 
object so that's why I use the text
either<00:03:35.079> way<00:03:35.319> is<00:03:35.470> fine

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
either way is fine

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.800 
either way is fine
but<00:03:36.099> you<00:03:36.400> just<00:03:36.549> get<00:03:36.699> more<00:03:36.909> customization<00:03:37.659> with

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
but you just get more customization with

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.770 
but you just get more customization with
the<00:03:37.900> text<00:03:38.169> object<00:03:38.340> so<00:03:39.340> I'll<00:03:39.489> insert<00:03:39.849> that<00:03:40.150> I'll

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
the text object so I'll insert that I'll

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.719 
the text object so I'll insert that I'll
click<00:03:41.079> somewhere<00:03:41.409> in<00:03:41.470> the<00:03:41.560> middle<00:03:41.919> I'm<00:03:42.549> going

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:42.729 
click somewhere in the middle I'm going

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:43.979 
click somewhere in the middle I'm going
to<00:03:42.790> resize<00:03:43.150> that<00:03:43.449> one<00:03:43.629> as<00:03:43.750> well

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
to resize that one as well

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:49.979 
to resize that one as well
let's<00:03:44.769> say<00:03:45.010> 500<00:03:45.909> by<00:03:47.159> 200<00:03:48.780> actually<00:03:49.780> we<00:03:49.870> could

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
let's say 500 by 200 actually we could

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.559 
let's say 500 by 200 actually we could
probably<00:03:50.139> have<00:03:50.349> that<00:03:50.620> be<00:03:51.150> 100<00:03:52.150> fit<00:03:52.389> a<00:03:52.419> little

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
probably have that be 100 fit a little

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.189 
probably have that be 100 fit a little
better<00:03:52.859> I'm<00:03:53.859> going<00:03:54.010> to<00:03:54.069> Center<00:03:54.459> the<00:03:55.150> text<00:03:55.629> like

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:56.199 
better I'm going to Center the text like

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:57.869 
better I'm going to Center the text like
we've<00:03:56.379> been<00:03:56.560> doing<00:03:56.949> so<00:03:57.400> Center<00:03:57.729> horizontally

00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:57.879 
we've been doing so Center horizontally

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:02.280 
we've been doing so Center horizontally
and<00:03:58.599> vertically<00:03:59.079> and<00:03:59.489> then<00:04:00.489> come<00:04:00.819> in<00:04:01.060> and<00:04:01.389> set

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
and vertically and then come in and set

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.009 
and vertically and then come in and set
the<00:04:02.409> font<00:04:02.650> size<00:04:02.949> to<00:04:03.400> let's<00:04:04.030> do<00:04:04.209> 48<00:04:04.629> so<00:04:04.810> a<00:04:04.840> little

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
the font size to let's do 48 so a little

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.599 
the font size to let's do 48 so a little
bit<00:04:05.169> smaller<00:04:05.470> than<00:04:05.650> the<00:04:05.769> title<00:04:06.099> but<00:04:06.190> still<00:04:06.459> put

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
bit smaller than the title but still put

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:09.449 
bit smaller than the title but still put
plenty<00:04:07.060> big<00:04:07.239> I'll<00:04:08.109> make<00:04:08.349> this<00:04:08.500> a<00:04:08.560> little<00:04:08.680> bit

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
plenty big I'll make this a little bit

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.559 
plenty big I'll make this a little bit
taller<00:04:10.620> alright<00:04:11.620> so<00:04:12.010> we<00:04:12.790> want<00:04:13.000> this<00:04:13.150> to<00:04:13.209> say

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
taller alright so we want this to say

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.440 
taller alright so we want this to say
play

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
play

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.870 
play
and<00:04:16.450> now<00:04:17.410> very<00:04:17.620> simply<00:04:18.070> the<00:04:18.190> logic<00:04:18.550> here<00:04:18.760> is

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
and now very simply the logic here is

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.210 
and now very simply the logic here is
when<00:04:19.030> we<00:04:19.120> click<00:04:19.300> on<00:04:19.330> that<00:04:19.570> play<00:04:19.780> button<00:04:20.050> we<00:04:20.830> go

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
when we click on that play button we go

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.850 
when we click on that play button we go
to<00:04:21.280> our<00:04:21.430> game<00:04:21.700> layout<00:04:22.060> and<00:04:22.330> the<00:04:23.260> way<00:04:23.410> we<00:04:23.590> handle

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
to our game layout and the way we handle

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.760 
to our game layout and the way we handle
clicks<00:04:24.760> and<00:04:25.090> touches<00:04:25.990> and<00:04:26.260> determining

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
clicks and touches and determining

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.290 
clicks and touches and determining
whether<00:04:26.950> or<00:04:27.040> not<00:04:27.160> we<00:04:27.370> click<00:04:27.610> or<00:04:27.820> touch<00:04:28.060> on<00:04:28.210> an

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
whether or not we click or touch on an

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.920 
whether or not we click or touch on an
object<00:04:28.750> is<00:04:28.870> with<00:04:29.620> the<00:04:29.890> touch<00:04:30.250> object<00:04:30.970> so<00:04:31.720> this

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
object is with the touch object so this

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.800 
object is with the touch object so this
touch<00:04:32.140> object<00:04:32.730> is<00:04:33.730> very<00:04:34.000> nice<00:04:34.150> because<00:04:34.390> it

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
touch object is very nice because it

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.680 
touch object is very nice because it
handles<00:04:35.320> both<00:04:35.800> click<00:04:36.340> input<00:04:36.820> and<00:04:37.090> touch<00:04:37.330> so<00:04:37.600> if

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
handles both click input and touch so if

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.560 
handles both click input and touch so if
you're<00:04:37.840> developing<00:04:37.990> for<00:04:38.650> a<00:04:39.300> mobile<00:04:40.300> game<00:04:40.330> of

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
you're developing for a mobile game of

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.480 
you're developing for a mobile game of
some<00:04:41.020> sort<00:04:41.080> it<00:04:41.620> could<00:04:41.800> be<00:04:41.920> let's<00:04:42.190> say<00:04:42.370> on

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
some sort it could be let's say on

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.480 
some sort it could be let's say on
Windows<00:04:42.850> 8<00:04:43.180> and<00:04:43.570> on<00:04:43.780> Windows<00:04:44.140> 8<00:04:44.290> you<00:04:44.650> might

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
Windows 8 and on Windows 8 you might

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.310 
Windows 8 and on Windows 8 you might
have<00:04:45.790> a<00:04:46.060> mouse<00:04:46.360> if<00:04:46.720> you're<00:04:46.930> dealing<00:04:47.200> with<00:04:47.230> a

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
have a mouse if you're dealing with a

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.590 
have a mouse if you're dealing with a
laptop<00:04:47.560> or<00:04:47.920> a<00:04:47.980> desktop<00:04:48.010> or<00:04:48.490> you<00:04:49.270> might<00:04:49.450> just

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
laptop or a desktop or you might just

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.940 
laptop or a desktop or you might just
have<00:04:49.750> touch<00:04:49.990> if<00:04:50.260> you're<00:04:50.380> just<00:04:50.560> dealing<00:04:50.650> with<00:04:50.830> a

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
have touch if you're just dealing with a

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.370 
have touch if you're just dealing with a
tablet<00:04:51.220> so<00:04:51.610> it<00:04:51.730> handles<00:04:52.060> both<00:04:52.210> of<00:04:52.390> those<00:04:52.510> so<00:04:53.320> to

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
tablet so it handles both of those so to

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.210 
tablet so it handles both of those so to
add<00:04:53.800> a<00:04:53.830> touch<00:04:54.250> object<00:04:54.790> just<00:04:55.330> double<00:04:55.660> click<00:04:55.870> and

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
add a touch object just double click and

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.970 
add a touch object just double click and
select<00:04:57.220> touch<00:04:57.640> and<00:04:58.450> we<00:04:59.320> just<00:04:59.500> need<00:04:59.620> to<00:04:59.710> insert

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980 
select touch and we just need to insert

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.680 
select touch and we just need to insert
it<00:05:00.130> that's<00:05:00.310> all<00:05:00.430> we<00:05:00.520> need<00:05:00.640> to<00:05:00.730> do<00:05:00.910> and<00:05:01.150> it<00:05:01.510> will

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
it that's all we need to do and it will

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.090 
it that's all we need to do and it will
show<00:05:01.900> up<00:05:02.110> over<00:05:02.380> here<00:05:02.500> on<00:05:02.830> the<00:05:02.920> right<00:05:03.160> under<00:05:03.490> our

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
show up over here on the right under our

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.950 
show up over here on the right under our
object<00:05:06.100> types<00:05:06.490> so<00:05:06.970> there's<00:05:07.150> the<00:05:07.300> touch<00:05:07.450> object

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
object types so there's the touch object

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.410 
object types so there's the touch object
and<00:05:08.170> now<00:05:08.800> let's<00:05:09.070> open<00:05:09.220> the<00:05:09.520> start<00:05:09.790> event<00:05:10.090> sheet

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:10.420 
and now let's open the start event sheet

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.980 
and now let's open the start event sheet
and<00:05:11.520> we<00:05:12.520> just<00:05:12.730> need<00:05:12.880> to<00:05:13.000> add<00:05:13.180> that<00:05:13.540> simple

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
and we just need to add that simple

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.070 
and we just need to add that simple
logic<00:05:14.410> for<00:05:14.950> when<00:05:15.280> we<00:05:15.460> click<00:05:15.730> on<00:05:15.970> the<00:05:16.750> play

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
logic for when we click on the play

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.170 
logic for when we click on the play
button<00:05:17.110> we<00:05:17.620> go<00:05:17.800> to<00:05:17.860> our<00:05:18.070> game<00:05:18.280> layout<00:05:18.610> so<00:05:19.030> let's

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
button we go to our game layout so let's

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.180 
button we go to our game layout so let's
add<00:05:19.420> event<00:05:19.810> and<00:05:20.050> we're<00:05:20.770> going<00:05:20.890> to<00:05:20.920> do<00:05:21.070> the

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
add event and we're going to do the

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.770 
add event and we're going to do the
touch<00:05:21.400> and<00:05:21.790> on<00:05:22.780> touched<00:05:23.380> object<00:05:24.010> and<00:05:24.600> then<00:05:25.600> we

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
touch and on touched object and then we

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.170 
touch and on touched object and then we
want<00:05:25.960> to<00:05:26.050> select<00:05:26.410> our<00:05:26.980> play<00:05:27.430> button<00:05:27.700> so<00:05:27.940> when

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
want to select our play button so when

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.640 
want to select our play button so when
we<00:05:28.330> click<00:05:28.540> our<00:05:28.720> play<00:05:28.900> button<00:05:29.230> it's<00:05:29.440> going<00:05:29.590> to

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
we click our play button it's going to

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.760 
we click our play button it's going to
be<00:05:29.770> the<00:05:29.890> event<00:05:30.250> and<00:05:30.990> done<00:05:31.990> and<00:05:32.230> then<00:05:32.680> the

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
be the event and done and then the

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.290 
be the event and done and then the
action<00:05:33.280> is<00:05:33.490> going<00:05:33.730> to<00:05:33.850> be<00:05:34.000> system<00:05:34.980> go<00:05:35.980> to

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
action is going to be system go to

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.480 
action is going to be system go to
layout<00:05:37.300> so<00:05:38.080> go<00:05:38.290> to<00:05:38.350> layout<00:05:38.590> then<00:05:39.280> we<00:05:39.370> can

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
layout so go to layout then we can

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.010 
layout so go to layout then we can
choose<00:05:39.700> which<00:05:39.940> layout<00:05:40.150> we<00:05:40.360> want<00:05:40.510> to<00:05:40.570> go<00:05:40.660> to<00:05:40.720> and

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
choose which layout we want to go to and

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.330 
choose which layout we want to go to and
obviously<00:05:41.350> from<00:05:41.560> start<00:05:41.860> we<00:05:42.010> want<00:05:42.160> to<00:05:42.220> go<00:05:42.310> to

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.340 
obviously from start we want to go to

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.780 
obviously from start we want to go to
game<00:05:43.380> so<00:05:44.380> you<00:05:44.470> could<00:05:44.680> use<00:05:44.890> that<00:05:44.920> system<00:05:45.490> go<00:05:45.760> to

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:45.790 
game so you could use that system go to

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.340 
game so you could use that system go to
layout<00:05:46.120> you<00:05:46.360> could<00:05:46.510> use<00:05:46.750> for<00:05:47.050> different

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:47.350 
layout you could use for different

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.680 
layout you could use for different
levels<00:05:47.710> different<00:05:48.130> pages<00:05:48.910> in<00:05:49.120> your<00:05:49.180> game

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
levels different pages in your game

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:51.450 
levels different pages in your game
whatever<00:05:50.110> it<00:05:50.230> is<00:05:50.350> pretty<00:05:51.070> simple<00:05:51.280> and

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
whatever it is pretty simple and

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.120 
whatever it is pretty simple and
straightforward<00:05:51.700> but<00:05:52.090> pretty<00:05:52.270> useful<00:05:52.770> so<00:05:53.770> let

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
straightforward but pretty useful so let

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.770 
straightforward but pretty useful so let
me<00:05:54.340> let's<00:05:54.850> see<00:05:55.030> let's<00:05:55.210> go<00:05:55.270> to<00:05:55.420> our<00:05:55.510> start

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:55.780 
me let's see let's go to our start

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.550 
me let's see let's go to our start
layout<00:05:56.050> and<00:05:56.260> let's<00:05:56.410> run<00:05:56.680> that<00:05:58.230> get<00:05:59.230> it<00:05:59.320> to<00:05:59.410> pop

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
layout and let's run that get it to pop

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.480 
layout and let's run that get it to pop
up<00:05:59.800> and<00:06:00.040> let<00:06:01.000> me<00:06:01.090> refresh<00:06:01.590> all<00:06:02.590> right<00:06:02.770> so<00:06:03.010> here

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
up and let me refresh all right so here

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:08.650 
up and let me refresh all right so here
let<00:06:04.060> me<00:06:04.120> close<00:06:04.330> out<00:06:04.540> some<00:06:04.780> of<00:06:04.840> these<00:06:04.960> tabs<00:06:05.260> to

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:08.660 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.850 

all<00:06:09.660> right<00:06:09.810> so<00:06:09.990> we<00:06:10.139> click<00:06:10.289> this<00:06:10.410> play<00:06:10.650> button

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
all right so we click this play button

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.629 
all right so we click this play button
now<00:06:11.490> we<00:06:11.520> should<00:06:11.910> go<00:06:12.180> into<00:06:12.389> our<00:06:12.750> game<00:06:13.340> but<00:06:14.340> when

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 
now we should go into our game but when

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:16.850 
now we should go into our game but when
we<00:06:14.759> lose<00:06:15.060> we<00:06:15.479> still<00:06:15.629> restart<00:06:16.319> right<00:06:16.650> so

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 
we lose we still restart right so

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.619 
we lose we still restart right so
instead<00:06:17.069> of<00:06:17.220> restarting<00:06:17.940> we<00:06:18.120> probably<00:06:18.360> want

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:18.629 
instead of restarting we probably want

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:22.249 
instead of restarting we probably want
to<00:06:18.659> go<00:06:18.810> back<00:06:19.050> to<00:06:19.319> our<00:06:20.250> Start<00:06:20.940> screen<00:06:21.060> right<00:06:22.020> so

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:22.259 
to go back to our Start screen right so

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:23.809 
to go back to our Start screen right so
let's<00:06:22.440> go<00:06:22.560> ahead<00:06:22.650> and<00:06:22.740> add<00:06:22.979> that<00:06:23.009> it's<00:06:23.669> going

00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:23.819 
let's go ahead and add that it's going

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:25.360 
let's go ahead and add that it's going
to<00:06:23.879> be<00:06:23.970> very<00:06:24.210> similar<00:06:24.629> to<00:06:24.780> what<00:06:24.870> we<00:06:24.990> just<00:06:25.139> did

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.370 
to be very similar to what we just did

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.129 
to be very similar to what we just did
and<00:06:26.370> let's<00:06:26.520> get<00:06:26.789> into<00:06:27.060> our<00:06:27.180> game<00:06:27.210> event<00:06:27.870> sheet

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:28.139 
and let's get into our game event sheet

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:31.010 
and let's get into our game event sheet
so<00:06:28.409> instead<00:06:28.770> of<00:06:28.830> these<00:06:29.819> restart<00:06:30.509> layouts<00:06:30.870> that

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
so instead of these restart layouts that

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.219 
so instead of these restart layouts that
we've<00:06:31.199> been<00:06:31.349> using<00:06:31.409> let's<00:06:32.009> say<00:06:32.069> we've<00:06:32.250> got<00:06:32.280> one

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:33.229 
we've been using let's say we've got one

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:38.330 
we've been using let's say we've got one
here<00:06:34.370> we've<00:06:35.370> got<00:06:35.520> two<00:06:35.879> and<00:06:36.330> then<00:06:37.259> three<00:06:37.650> so

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:38.340 
here we've got two and then three so

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.339 
here we've got two and then three so
instead<00:06:38.610> of<00:06:38.669> using<00:06:38.909> those<00:06:39.210> we<00:06:40.020> can<00:06:40.169> just

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:40.349 
instead of using those we can just

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:42.409 
instead of using those we can just
double<00:06:40.710> click<00:06:40.740> to<00:06:41.099> open<00:06:41.130> and<00:06:41.610> edit<00:06:41.669> those<00:06:42.030> and

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:42.419 
double click to open and edit those and

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:44.719 
double click to open and edit those and
then<00:06:43.139> instead<00:06:43.409> of<00:06:43.470> restarting<00:06:44.099> layout<00:06:44.400> we<00:06:44.580> can

00:06:44.719 --> 00:06:44.729 
then instead of restarting layout we can

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:47.420 
then instead of restarting layout we can
go<00:06:44.849> to<00:06:44.909> layout<00:06:45.360> and<00:06:45.770> we<00:06:46.770> can<00:06:46.949> go<00:06:47.069> to<00:06:47.099> start

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:47.430 
go to layout and we can go to start

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.149 
go to layout and we can go to start
layout<00:06:47.759> so<00:06:48.630> done<00:06:48.900> and<00:06:49.620> I'm<00:06:49.710> going<00:06:49.830> to<00:06:49.860> do<00:06:50.009> that

00:06:50.149 --> 00:06:50.159 
layout so done and I'm going to do that

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:52.670 
layout so done and I'm going to do that
for<00:06:50.370> each<00:06:50.550> one<00:06:50.940> of<00:06:51.060> these<00:06:51.240> so<00:06:51.840> restart<00:06:52.380> layout

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:52.680 
for each one of these so restart layout

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.740 
for each one of these so restart layout
I'll<00:06:52.860> change<00:06:53.130> to<00:06:53.190> go<00:06:53.400> to<00:06:53.460> layout<00:06:53.819> and<00:06:54.449> go<00:06:54.690> to

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:54.750 
I'll change to go to layout and go to

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:58.040 
I'll change to go to layout and go to
start<00:06:55.440> and<00:06:55.759> done<00:06:56.759> and<00:06:57.150> then<00:06:57.419> one<00:06:57.659> more<00:06:57.870> at<00:06:57.960> the
