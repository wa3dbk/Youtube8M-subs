00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
make a card for teacher because I think

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.370 
make a card for teacher because I think
sometimes<00:01:12.030> teachers<00:01:12.510> don't<00:01:12.990> get<00:01:13.140> enough

sometimes teachers don't get enough
recognition<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.430> would<00:01:14.580> be<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.700> fun

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
recognition and that would be a fun

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.450 
recognition and that would be a fun

this and it's tape so its adhesive and
it<00:02:04.619> sticks<00:02:04.889> and<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.189> can<00:02:05.340> just<00:02:05.490> rip<00:02:05.700> it<00:02:05.789> like

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
it sticks and you can just rip it like

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.000 
it sticks and you can just rip it like
you<00:02:06.090> would<00:02:06.240> normal<00:02:06.659> tape

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.010 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:12.040 

we<00:02:10.010> will<00:02:10.220> put<00:02:10.430> another<00:02:10.820> strip<00:02:11.360> right<00:02:11.690> by<00:02:12.020> it

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
we will put another strip right by it

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.860 
we will put another strip right by it
you<00:02:15.490> could<00:02:16.490> use<00:02:16.640> pattern<00:02:17.150> paper<00:02:17.390> for<00:02:17.720> this

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
you could use pattern paper for this

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.630 
you could use pattern paper for this
technique<00:02:18.380> or<00:02:18.620> whatever<00:02:18.890> you<00:02:19.070> want<00:02:19.310> and<00:02:19.580> you

technique or whatever you want and you

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.160 
technique or whatever you want and you
can<00:02:19.850> just<00:02:19.970> see<00:02:20.150> I've<00:02:20.270> just<00:02:20.510> duct<00:02:20.750> tape<00:02:20.990> down

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
can just see I've just duct tape down

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.690 
can just see I've just duct tape down
there<00:02:21.430> now<00:02:22.430> will<00:02:22.640> add<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:23.120> smartypants

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700

this<00:02:32.600> was<00:02:32.810> a<00:02:32.840> ruler<00:02:33.350> and<00:02:33.590> I've<00:02:34.550> cut<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.030> grid

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
this was a ruler and I've cut the grid

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.780 
this was a ruler and I've cut the grid
side<00:02:35.750> so<00:02:36.170> that<00:02:36.350> it<00:02:36.440> will<00:02:36.560> fit<00:02:36.620> across<00:02:37.160> the<00:02:37.640> edge

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
side so that it will fit across the edge

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.120 
side so that it will fit across the edge
of<00:02:38.000> my<00:02:38.210> card<00:02:38.510> and<00:02:38.810> I<00:02:39.290> want<00:02:39.530> to<00:02:39.710> create<00:02:40.040> a

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
of my card and I want to create a

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.820 
of my card and I want to create a
pennant<00:02:40.730> or<00:02:41.030> a<00:02:41.060> banner<00:02:41.480> shape<00:02:41.930> so<00:02:42.380> to<00:02:42.470> do<00:02:42.800> that

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
pennant or a banner shape so to do that

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.700 
pennant or a banner shape so to do that
I<00:02:43.190> fold<00:02:43.850> it<00:02:44.000> in<00:02:44.120> half<00:02:44.150> without<00:02:44.570> creasing<00:02:45.050> fold

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
I fold it in half without creasing fold

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.510 
I fold it in half without creasing fold
and<00:02:46.070> then<00:02:46.910> I<00:02:47.000> use<00:02:47.210> my<00:02:47.420> scissors<00:02:47.720> and<00:02:48.400> find<00:02:49.400> the

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
and then I use my scissors and find the

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.580 
and then I use my scissors and find the
halfway<00:02:49.730> point<00:02:49.940> and<00:02:50.330> cut<00:02:50.600> in<00:02:50.870> about<00:02:51.170> half<00:02:51.410> an

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
halfway point and cut in about half an

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.420 
halfway point and cut in about half an
inch<00:02:51.770> and<00:02:52.760> a<00:02:52.820> cut<00:02:53.030> from<00:02:53.210> corner<00:02:53.690> to<00:02:53.720> that<00:02:53.900> cut

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
inch and a cut from corner to that cut

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.130 
inch and a cut from corner to that cut
and<00:02:55.430> that<00:02:55.580> makes<00:02:55.790> sure<00:02:56.030> that<00:02:56.060> both<00:02:56.420> sides<00:02:56.720> get

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
and that makes sure that both sides get

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.000 
and that makes sure that both sides get
the<00:02:57.290> same<00:02:57.650> and<00:02:58.550> this<00:02:59.590> so<00:03:00.590> you<00:03:00.650> can<00:03:00.770> see<00:03:00.920> how<00:03:00.980> it

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
the same and this so you can see how it

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.030 
the same and this so you can see how it
looks<00:03:01.130> like<00:03:01.370> on<00:03:01.490> this<00:03:01.670> side<00:03:02.020> and<00:03:03.020> then<00:03:03.920> we'll

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
looks like on this side and then we'll

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.640 
looks like on this side and then we'll
add<00:03:04.160> adhesive<00:03:04.370> to<00:03:04.970> it<00:03:05.090> back<00:03:05.330> and<00:03:06.230> we'll<00:03:06.350> put<00:03:06.560> it

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
add adhesive to it back and we'll put it

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.020 
add adhesive to it back and we'll put it
right<00:03:06.890> across<00:03:07.190> the<00:03:07.550> line<00:03:07.850> in<00:03:08.210> that<00:03:10.030> journaling

out to whatever pattern paper you like

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.690 
out to whatever pattern paper you like
and<00:04:08.360> then<00:04:09.080> you<00:04:09.140> just<00:04:09.320> close<00:04:09.800> up<00:04:09.830> the<00:04:10.250> package

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
and then you just close up the package

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.910 
and then you just close up the package
again<00:04:10.850> and<00:04:11.330> then<00:04:12.050> we'll<00:04:12.170> go<00:04:12.290> ahead<00:04:12.410> and<00:04:12.560> finish

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
again and then we'll go ahead and finish

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.430 
again and then we'll go ahead and finish
decorating<00:04:13.310> this<00:04:13.880> so<00:04:14.660> that<00:04:14.870> we<00:04:14.990> can<00:04:15.170> give<00:04:15.320> it

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
decorating this so that we can give it

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.740 
decorating this so that we can give it
to<00:04:15.470> the<00:04:15.650> teacher<00:04:15.830> along<00:04:16.310> with<00:04:16.460> the<00:04:16.580> card<00:04:16.850> so

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
to the teacher along with the card so

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.599 
to the teacher along with the card so
again<00:04:18.049> this<00:04:18.320> strip<00:04:18.620> is<00:04:18.770> cut<00:04:19.070> from<00:04:19.340> the

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
again this strip is cut from the

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:21.050 
again this strip is cut from the
journaling<00:04:20.419> paper

journaling paper

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.270 
journaling paper
and<00:04:21.150> this<00:04:21.720> is<00:04:21.900> a<00:04:21.930> diagonal<00:04:22.260> border<00:04:22.980> that<00:04:23.130> was

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
and this is a diagonal border that was

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.440 
and this is a diagonal border that was
on<00:04:23.430> there<00:04:23.550> but<00:04:23.700> I'm<00:04:23.790> not<00:04:23.940> going<00:04:24.060> to<00:04:24.120> use<00:04:24.270> the

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
on there but I'm not going to use the

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.760 
on there but I'm not going to use the
diagonal<00:04:24.900> set<00:04:25.050> I'm<00:04:25.139> gonna<00:04:25.290> use<00:04:25.380> the<00:04:25.530> graph

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
diagonal set I'm gonna use the graph

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.740 
diagonal set I'm gonna use the graph
side<00:04:26.040> again<00:04:26.310> so<00:04:26.580> that<00:04:26.730> it<00:04:26.820> matches<00:04:26.970> my<00:04:27.389> card

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
side again so that it matches my card

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.340 
side again so that it matches my card
using<00:04:28.710> the<00:04:28.800> same<00:04:29.070> technique<00:04:29.930> cut<00:04:30.930> the<00:04:31.110> graph

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
using the same technique cut the graph

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.850 
using the same technique cut the graph

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
paper into a pennant shape and this time

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.260 
paper into a pennant shape and this time
when<00:04:35.100> you're<00:04:35.250> using<00:04:35.460> adhesive<00:04:35.790> you'll

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
when you're using adhesive you'll

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.670 
when you're using adhesive you'll
probably<00:04:36.540> want<00:04:36.810> to<00:04:36.900> use<00:04:37.080> something<00:04:37.110> like<00:04:37.530> a

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
probably want to use something like a

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.909 
probably want to use something like a
glue<00:04:38.040> dot<00:04:38.070> or<00:04:38.669> a<00:04:38.700> sticky<00:04:39.090> tape<00:04:39.419> to<00:04:40.290> adhere<00:04:40.410> the

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
glue dot or a sticky tape to adhere the

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.030 
glue dot or a sticky tape to adhere the
paper<00:04:41.160> to<00:04:41.580> the<00:04:41.610> packaging<00:04:42.450> so<00:04:43.380> one<00:04:43.830> way<00:04:43.980> to

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
paper to the packaging so one way to

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.720 
paper to the packaging so one way to
recycle<00:04:44.880> is<00:04:45.360> to<00:04:45.780> use<00:04:46.200> the<00:04:46.230> packaging<00:04:46.950> for

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
recycle is to use the packaging for

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.390 
recycle is to use the packaging for
something<00:04:48.330> entirely<00:04:48.630> new<00:04:48.900> in<00:04:49.260> this<00:04:49.800> case<00:04:50.130> a

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.659 
something entirely new in this case a
gift<00:04:50.970> for<00:04:51.240> the<00:04:51.330> teacher<00:04:52.190> so<00:04:53.190> then<00:04:53.310> we<00:04:53.490> can

gift for the teacher so then we can

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:55.700 
gift for the teacher so then we can
decorate<00:04:53.910> the<00:04:54.419> front<00:04:54.750> of<00:04:54.960> the<00:04:55.110> box<00:04:55.290> with
