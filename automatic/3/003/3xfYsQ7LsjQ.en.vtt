system<00:00:28.000> here<00:00:28.480> which<00:00:28.990> actually<00:00:29.350> pulls<00:00:29.710> away

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
system here which actually pulls away

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.670 
system here which actually pulls away
from<00:00:30.039> the<00:00:30.279> bow<00:00:30.520> as<00:00:30.730> you<00:00:30.850> draw<00:00:31.119> it<00:00:31.240> back<00:00:31.449> and<00:00:31.779> it

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
from the bow as you draw it back and it

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.229 
from the bow as you draw it back and it
makes<00:00:32.710> the<00:00:33.040> limb<00:00:33.250> not<00:00:33.460> have<00:00:33.640> to<00:00:33.760> carry<00:00:34.030> the

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
makes the limb not have to carry the

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.049 
makes the limb not have to carry the
load<00:00:34.480> of<00:00:34.510> that<00:00:34.930> and<00:00:35.170> and<00:00:35.949> so<00:00:36.580> it's<00:00:36.879> a<00:00:36.940> really

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:37.059 
load of that and and so it's a really

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:39.869 
load of that and and so it's a really
new<00:00:37.570> unique<00:00:38.019> system<00:00:38.530> now<00:00:38.980> for<00:00:39.280> some<00:00:39.610> people

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:39.879

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
the bow that much lighter the camel in

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.090 
the bow that much lighter the camel in
this<00:00:49.780> bow<00:00:49.960> is<00:00:49.989> also<00:00:50.440> a<00:00:50.469> little<00:00:50.620> bit<00:00:50.770> different

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
this bow is also a little bit different

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.270 
this bow is also a little bit different
shape<00:00:51.129> it's<00:00:51.610> still<00:00:51.879> our<00:00:52.120> KT<00:00:52.390> cam<00:00:52.870> but<00:00:53.620> it's<00:00:54.190> a

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
shape it's still our KT cam but it's a

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.010 
shape it's still our KT cam but it's a
little<00:00:54.430> rounded<00:00:54.789> out<00:00:54.910> here<00:00:55.180> and<00:00:55.360> it<00:00:55.690> may<00:00:55.780> just

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.020 
little rounded out here and it may just

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.869 
little rounded out here and it may just
be<00:00:56.079> me<00:00:56.410> and<00:00:56.440> my<00:00:56.739> initial<00:00:57.160> perception<00:00:57.730> of<00:00:57.789> the

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
be me and my initial perception of the

00:00:57.879 --> 00:00:59.549 
be me and my initial perception of the
bow<00:00:58.030> but<00:00:58.570> it<00:00:58.660> does<00:00:58.840> seem<00:00:59.020> to<00:00:59.140> draw<00:00:59.320> a<00:00:59.350> little

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
bow but it does seem to draw a little

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.610 
bow but it does seem to draw a little
bit<00:00:59.739> smoother<00:01:00.190> which<00:01:00.340> is<00:01:00.460> definitely<00:01:00.640> a<00:01:00.910> plus

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
bit smoother which is definitely a plus

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.990 
bit smoother which is definitely a plus
this<00:01:02.620> bill<00:01:02.860> comes<00:01:03.129> in<00:01:03.340> weighing<00:01:03.579> only<00:01:03.910> at

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
this bill comes in weighing only at

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.730 
this bill comes in weighing only at
three<00:01:04.239> point<00:01:04.479> eight<00:01:04.570> pounds<00:01:05.110> they've<00:01:05.560> got

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
three point eight pounds they've got

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.380 
three point eight pounds they've got
some<00:01:05.920> unique<00:01:06.160> cutouts<00:01:06.550> and<00:01:06.729> the<00:01:06.789> riser<00:01:07.030> that

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
some unique cutouts and the riser that

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.719 
some unique cutouts and the riser that
you<00:01:07.539> can<00:01:07.690> see<00:01:07.930> here<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:09.310> that's<00:01:09.490> gonna<00:01:09.640> be

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
you can see here so that's gonna be

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.279 
you can see here so that's gonna be
really<00:01:09.850> really<00:01:10.149> nice<00:01:10.479> especially<00:01:10.750> for<00:01:11.080> the

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:11.289 
really really nice especially for the

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:14.399 
really really nice especially for the
guys<00:01:11.410> that<00:01:11.440> do<00:01:11.680> a<00:01:11.710> lot<00:01:11.920> of<00:01:11.950> hiking<00:01:12.280> and<00:01:13.320> like<00:01:14.320> I

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
guys that do a lot of hiking and like I

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.140 
guys that do a lot of hiking and like I
said<00:01:14.470> before<00:01:14.619> you<00:01:15.070> can<00:01:15.189> take<00:01:15.369> out<00:01:15.610> these<00:01:15.760> air

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
said before you can take out these air

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.000 
said before you can take out these air
shock<00:01:16.540> systems<00:01:17.080> and<00:01:17.320> actually<00:01:17.470> probably<00:01:17.920> lose

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
shock systems and actually probably lose

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.469 
shock systems and actually probably lose
a<00:01:18.040> little<00:01:18.310> bit<00:01:18.400> more<00:01:18.580> weight<00:01:18.790> and<00:01:19.090> I<00:01:19.420> don't

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
a little bit more weight and I don't

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:20.880 
a little bit more weight and I don't
think<00:01:19.780> the<00:01:19.840> bow<00:01:19.990> is<00:01:20.049> gonna<00:01:20.229> be<00:01:20.350> much<00:01:20.560> louder

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
think the bow is gonna be much louder

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.010 
think the bow is gonna be much louder
without<00:01:21.130> those<00:01:21.520> anyways<00:01:22.000> so<00:01:22.360> I'll<00:01:22.810> have<00:01:22.930> to

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
without those anyways so I'll have to

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.080 
without those anyways so I'll have to
try<00:01:23.200> that<00:01:23.380> down<00:01:23.560> the<00:01:23.680> road<00:01:23.830> disposed<00:01:24.700> coming

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
try that down the road disposed coming

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.580 
try that down the road disposed coming
stock<00:01:25.360> with<00:01:25.570> the<00:01:25.659> wood<00:01:25.840> grip<00:01:26.140> which<00:01:26.320> in<00:01:26.470> my

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
stock with the wood grip which in my

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.350 
stock with the wood grip which in my
opinion<00:01:26.740> is<00:01:27.189> a<00:01:27.220> big<00:01:27.490> improvement<00:01:27.790> over<00:01:28.270> the

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
opinion is a big improvement over the

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.060 
opinion is a big improvement over the
rubber<00:01:28.570> grip<00:01:28.869> the<00:01:29.380> rubber<00:01:29.590> grip<00:01:29.830> that<00:01:29.979> they

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
rubber grip the rubber grip that they

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.100 
rubber grip the rubber grip that they
had<00:01:30.280> looked<00:01:30.610> nice<00:01:30.850> but<00:01:31.210> I<00:01:31.390> think<00:01:31.689> everybody

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
had looked nice but I think everybody

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.719 
had looked nice but I think everybody
you<00:01:32.380> know<00:01:32.590> for<00:01:33.009> the<00:01:33.070> most<00:01:33.189> part<00:01:33.369> is<00:01:33.580> going<00:01:33.670> to

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
you know for the most part is going to

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.820 
you know for the most part is going to
enjoy<00:01:33.880> the<00:01:34.210> wood<00:01:34.390> grip<00:01:34.570> quite<00:01:34.810> a<00:01:34.869> bit<00:01:35.020> more<00:01:35.200> so

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
enjoy the wood grip quite a bit more so

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.410 
enjoy the wood grip quite a bit more so
