fire rate is number six not bad at all
ranges<00:02:08.670> number<00:02:09.179> four<00:02:09.450> here<00:02:09.599> we<00:02:09.720> go<00:02:09.869> again<00:02:10.020> with

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
ranges number four here we go again with

ranges number four here we go again with
the<00:02:10.349> range<00:02:10.649> man<00:02:10.950> we<00:02:11.160> got<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.340> do<00:02:11.550> some<00:02:11.819> about

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
the range man we got to do some about

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.500 
the range man we got to do some about
that<00:02:12.209> rain

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
that rain

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.869 
that rain
handling<00:02:13.170> this<00:02:13.319> number<00:02:13.590> 14<00:02:14.189> it<00:02:14.400> did<00:02:14.610> take<00:02:14.849> a

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
handling this number 14 it did take a

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.990 
handling this number 14 it did take a

negative one a decline mobility still at
12<00:02:18.120> but<00:02:18.629> the<00:02:18.750> good<00:02:18.959> thing<00:02:19.019> is<00:02:19.200> is<00:02:19.500> this<00:02:19.650> check

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
12 but the good thing is is this check

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.440 
12 but the good thing is is this check
this<00:02:19.980> out<00:02:20.159> and<00:02:20.489> there's<00:02:20.760> no<00:02:20.909> scope<00:02:21.180> that<00:02:21.299> has

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
this out and there's no scope that has

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.720 
this out and there's no scope that has
allowed<00:02:21.689> on<00:02:21.870> this<00:02:21.989> gun<00:02:22.230> as<00:02:22.409> well<00:02:22.439> do<00:02:22.799> so<00:02:23.010> FYI

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
allowed on this gun as well do so FYI

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.990 
allowed on this gun as well do so FYI
but<00:02:24.540> we<00:02:24.659> have<00:02:24.689> a<00:02:24.840> 2<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:25.349> 1<00:02:25.379> ratio<00:02:25.920> on<00:02:26.790> this

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
but we have a 2 to 1 ratio on this

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.569 
but we have a 2 to 1 ratio on this
normally<00:02:27.480> you<00:02:27.599> get<00:02:27.750> a<00:02:27.810> 2<00:02:28.019> and<00:02:28.230> 2<00:02:28.379> 1<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:28.829> 1<00:02:29.010> you

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579 
normally you get a 2 and 2 1 and 1 you

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:30.649 
normally you get a 2 and 2 1 and 1 you
know<00:02:29.730> so<00:02:29.970> this<00:02:30.120> is<00:02:30.269> actually<00:02:30.420> really

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:30.659 
know so this is actually really

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:32.270 
know so this is actually really
interesting<00:02:31.290> for<00:02:31.409> the<00:02:31.470> bulldog<00:02:31.799> face<00:02:32.010> a<00:02:32.220> more

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
is pretty much a good best class setup

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.390 
is pretty much a good best class setup
that<00:02:40.140> I<00:02:40.170> would<00:02:40.319> have<00:02:40.409> to<00:02:40.590> say<00:02:40.620> for<00:02:40.799> the<00:02:41.010> bulldog

me know what you guys think about it

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.020 
me know what you guys think about it
without<00:02:45.420> further<00:02:45.569> ado<00:02:46.010> foregrip<00:02:47.010> laser<00:02:47.549> sight

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
without further ado foregrip laser sight

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.599 
without further ado foregrip laser sight
and<00:02:48.269> advanced<00:02:49.140> rifle<00:02:51.650> for<00:02:52.650> grip<00:02:52.980> advanced

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
and advanced rifle for grip advanced

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:57.619 
and advanced rifle for grip advanced
site<00:02:54.230> I'm<00:02:55.230> sorry<00:02:55.470> for<00:02:55.709> grip<00:02:56.040> laser<00:02:56.879> sight<00:02:57.359> and

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
site I'm sorry for grip laser sight and

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:59.629 
site I'm sorry for grip laser sight and
advanced<00:02:58.440> a<00:02:58.500> trifling<00:02:59.010> let's<00:02:59.190> just<00:02:59.370> look<00:02:59.489> at

00:02:59.629 --> 00:02:59.639 
advanced a trifling let's just look at

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:04.270 
advanced a trifling let's just look at
it<00:02:59.670> real<00:02:59.909> quick<00:03:00.060> you<00:03:00.239> guys<00:03:00.920> take<00:03:01.920> that<00:03:01.950> off<00:03:02.359> ok

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
it real quick you guys take that off ok

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.059 
it real quick you guys take that off ok
so<00:03:05.280> laser<00:03:06.000> sight<00:03:06.450> ads<00:03:06.720> on<00:03:07.170> will<00:03:07.769> not<00:03:07.889> only

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
so laser sight ads on will not only

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.190 
so laser sight ads on will not only
hipfire<00:03:08.549> accuracy<00:03:08.849> but<00:03:09.120> that's<00:03:09.269> also<00:03:09.599> adds<00:03:09.989> on

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
hipfire accuracy but that's also adds on

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.800 
hipfire accuracy but that's also adds on
total<00:03:10.560> to<00:03:10.739> a<00:03:10.950> plus<00:03:11.459> 2<00:03:11.700> and<00:03:11.819> on<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.329> accuracy

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
total to a plus 2 and on the accuracy

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.890 
total to a plus 2 and on the accuracy
itself<00:03:13.349> so<00:03:13.560> BAM<00:03:14.040> want<00:03:14.310> that<00:03:14.489> on<00:03:14.670> there<00:03:14.849> for<00:03:15.810> the

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
itself so BAM want that on there for the

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:16.939 
itself so BAM want that on there for the
fact<00:03:16.170> that<00:03:16.260> we<00:03:16.379> need<00:03:16.500> a<00:03:16.530> little<00:03:16.709> bit<00:03:16.829> more

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:16.949 
fact that we need a little bit more

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:18.770 
fact that we need a little bit more
accuracy<00:03:17.430> I<00:03:17.549> believe<00:03:17.940> especially<00:03:18.180> since<00:03:18.660> it's

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
accuracy I believe especially since it's

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.379 
accuracy I believe especially since it's
a<00:03:18.840> shoddy<00:03:19.250> let's<00:03:20.250> add<00:03:20.400> a<00:03:20.430> little<00:03:20.579> bit<00:03:20.730> two<00:03:21.090> more

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
a shoddy let's add a little bit two more

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.119 
a shoddy let's add a little bit two more
to<00:03:21.569> it<00:03:21.720> by<00:03:21.870> adding<00:03:22.019> the<00:03:22.199> foregrip<00:03:22.709> on<00:03:22.949> there

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
to it by adding the foregrip on there

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:25.610 
to it by adding the foregrip on there
hey<00:03:23.849> you<00:03:24.239> know<00:03:24.329> what<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.720> range<00:03:25.019> is<00:03:25.230> really

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
hey you know what the range is really

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.379 
hey you know what the range is really
low<00:03:25.799> so<00:03:25.829> let's<00:03:26.430> go<00:03:26.609> ahead<00:03:26.639> and<00:03:26.849> add<00:03:27.180> the

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389 
low so let's go ahead and add the

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:29.750 
low so let's go ahead and add the
advanced<00:03:27.989> rifling<00:03:28.530> and<00:03:28.709> put<00:03:29.010> it<00:03:29.099> at<00:03:29.250> a<00:03:29.340> number

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
advanced rifling and put it at a number

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.210 
advanced rifling and put it at a number
six<00:03:30.120> at<00:03:30.750> least<00:03:30.959> it<00:03:31.139> gives<00:03:31.260> us<00:03:31.500> a<00:03:31.620> little<00:03:31.889> bit<00:03:32.069> of

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
six at least it gives us a little bit of

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.189 
six at least it gives us a little bit of
a<00:03:32.280> leeway<00:03:32.489> right<00:03:32.849> here<00:03:33.120> now<00:03:33.569> check<00:03:33.780> this<00:03:33.870> out<00:03:34.049> I

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:34.199 
a leeway right here now check this out I

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:37.129 
a leeway right here now check this out I
had<00:03:34.590> I<00:03:34.739> did<00:03:35.220> fill<00:03:35.549> up<00:03:35.699> play<00:03:35.970> around<00:03:36.299> with<00:03:36.629> you
