yeah now they're going to make me change

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:23.820 
yeah now they're going to make me change
the<00:04:11.220> input<00:04:11.569> myself<00:04:20.630> there<00:04:21.630> it<00:04:21.720> is

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.129 

this<00:04:24.830> is<00:04:24.919> boring<00:04:25.160> Xbox<00:04:25.490> setup<00:04:25.790> stuff<00:04:26.139> so

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
this is boring Xbox setup stuff so

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:28.659 
this is boring Xbox setup stuff so
there's<00:04:27.350> a<00:04:27.410> controller<00:04:27.889> it's<00:04:28.100> not<00:04:28.250> synced<00:04:28.580> up

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 
there's a controller it's not synced up

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:34.420 
there's a controller it's not synced up
so<00:04:29.300> sync<00:04:29.810> button<00:04:30.880> is<00:04:31.880> all<00:04:32.030> going<00:04:33.310> now<00:04:34.310> we

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
so sync button is all going now we

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.310 
so sync button is all going now we
probably<00:04:34.610> don't<00:04:34.789> need<00:04:34.940> to<00:04:35.030> see<00:04:35.210> all<00:04:35.330> this<00:04:35.509> the

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
probably don't need to see all this the

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.140 
probably don't need to see all this the
