00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 economic collisions first collapse 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.640
 then the growth of the ruble as it happens already 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.680
 gave rise to panic 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.719
 the hype around sberbank's ATMs 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.610
 Cheboksary discussed in all social networks 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.509
 what happened and how it will develop 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.789
 the situation in our story Russians 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.710
 life experience over 20 years in the period 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.869
 economic storms behave in general 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.060
 equally if there is not Perry and 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.920
 We urgently need to invest in a business like 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.140
 rule are considered household appliances 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.519
 car property for older people 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.250
 an overwhelming desire arises 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.870
 buy salt and cereals for what it is you 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.270
 need money you can of course use 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.559
 and cashless payments but not all sellers 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.170
 can provide such an opportunity 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.809
 shorter cash needed yes today 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.539
 ATM quietly coped load 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.770
 however after rumors spread 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:49.200
 alleged blocking a savings card 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.480
 started some ATMs one by one 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.399
 began to refuse il cash many 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.469
 generally stopped working and 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.989
 the forums users are quite literate 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.390
 everyone clarifies processing 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.670
 saber hangs because everyone rushes to 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.040
 cash self-service devices in 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.439
 banks are not for the same reason I literally 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.920
 10 minutes ago at the grocery store 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.360
 calmly paid the card had 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.430
 sms notification amount removed the rest 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.770
 money is still in the account of fear 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.930
 eyes are large and even if the ATM is not 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.729
 will be money with a passport and a card in 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.340
 any office and shoot at the box office 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.930
 of cash as much as you need us 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.820
 Today, colleagues mom called with 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.229
 a withdrawal order so does work for us 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.390
 ran to the nearest ATM 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.470
 and we laughed for example I was born and raised 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.420
 soviet union 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.610
 saw all our crisis and but not getting tired 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.799
 repeat colleagues to pay for the phone 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.960
 rent a gas extra classes in 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.950
 school loans for children can not 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.960
 moving away from the computer 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.079
 between the experiences of past crises and 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.579
 dull and alarmist sleep there is no connection 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.590
 previous years as now I did not run 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.960
 not for salt not for buckwheat and therefore 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.759
 never noticed that problem at the same time 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.710
 ATMs of other banks such 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.840
 massive attacks are not subject though 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.060
 savings bank owners and they withdraw money there 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.180
 not caring about the commission what caused this 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.490
 excitement and what measures to take Sberbank 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.280
 the bank does not in any way block 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.200
 no cards of their customers and will not 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.390
 we have to do this already 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.670
 confirmation from international payment 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.320
 systems that they are working normally 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:21.600
 their release will also be out soon 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.910
 the second is cards 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.310
 settle in a trading network in 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.840
 supermarkets 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.510
 gas stations myself today 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.540
 drove here supermarket everything works 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.510
 normal mode, everything is fine and the third 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.360
 this is what given the increased demand 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.300
 population we translate 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.120
 our branches for extended operation 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.580
 All our branches will work until 20 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.610
 hours and 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.440
 the branch number will work until 21 o'clock but 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.120
 you on work and saturday and sunday 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.580
 accordingly all the customers who come to us 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.250
 will come but bypass everyone 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.420
 information that some shops 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.850
 refused to accept cards today 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.560
 explaining that there is no communication with the bank yuri 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.780
 Bychkovsky noticed let it stay 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.850
 individual ATMs on their conscience 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.709
 warned employees of the Savings Bank due 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.660
 loads refuse to work easier 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.300
 saying hang this phenomenon temporary 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:19.410
 as well as the limits on the issuance of cash 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.040
 funds from the limits defined in our 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.630
 branches 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.660
 by personality I ask with understanding 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.970
 treat our customers here 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.130
 this rush demand up 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.560
 led to the fact that there in a number of ATMs 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.010
 run out of money unplanned therefore 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.750
 our 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.390
 and collection service works 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.860
 unscheduled downloads additional 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.700
 cash ATM 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:45.310
 so please treat me with understanding 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.110
 I think the situation is temporary layer all 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.390
 This we already passed the more 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.030
 panic the longer last 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.860
 a negative phenomenon honestly confess one 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.580
 times of life due to inexperience me too 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:00.130

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:04.080
