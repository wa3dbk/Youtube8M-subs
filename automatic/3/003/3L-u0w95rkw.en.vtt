00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
go to frag grenades and then I usually

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.600 
go to frag grenades and then I usually
put<00:02:50.420> the<00:02:50.570> item<00:02:50.930> costs<00:02:51.380> on<00:02:51.530> zero<00:02:51.980> because<00:02:52.430> then

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
put the item costs on zero because then

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.880 
put the item costs on zero because then
the<00:02:52.790> frag<00:02:53.030> grenades<00:02:53.360> don't<00:02:53.660> cost<00:02:53.810> anything<00:02:54.050> so

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
the frag grenades don't cost anything so

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.250 
the frag grenades don't cost anything so
you<00:02:54.950> get<00:02:55.100> to<00:02:55.370> see<00:02:55.640> and<00:02:56.209> then<00:02:56.420> you<00:02:56.720> just<00:02:56.900> hit<00:02:57.080> the

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
you get to see and then you just hit the

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:08.920 
you get to see and then you just hit the
