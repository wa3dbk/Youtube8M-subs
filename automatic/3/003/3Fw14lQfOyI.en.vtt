00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
now what we want to do is to relate this

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.370 
now what we want to do is to relate this
background<00:02:14.850> image<00:02:15.270> because<00:02:15.720> we<00:02:16.050> don't<00:02:16.230> want

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
background image because we don't want

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.200 
background image because we don't want
to<00:02:16.440> white<00:02:16.590> background<00:02:17.550> image<00:02:17.760> we<00:02:17.970> want

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
to white background image we want

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.050 
to white background image we want
transparent<00:02:19.730> so<00:02:20.730> we're<00:02:20.850> going<00:02:20.940> to<00:02:21.030> click

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
transparent so we're going to click

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.140 
transparent so we're going to click
delete<00:02:22.220> another<00:02:23.220> thing<00:02:23.370> we<00:02:23.400> want<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:23.700> do<00:02:23.850> is

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
delete another thing we want to do is

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.910 
delete another thing we want to do is
just<00:02:24.660> crop<00:02:24.990> out<00:02:25.200> a<00:02:26.840> couple<00:02:27.840> pixels<00:02:28.350> which<00:02:28.650> are

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
just crop out a couple pixels which are

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.850 
just crop out a couple pixels which are
at<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.640> top<00:02:29.850> and<00:02:30.510> on<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.750> left<00:02:31.050> we're<00:02:31.740> not

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
at the top and on the left we're not

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.370 
at the top and on the left we're not
going<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:32.070> touch<00:02:32.280> on<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:33.420> right<00:02:33.630> and<00:02:33.870> the

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
going to touch on the right and the

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.520 
going to touch on the right and the
bottom<00:02:34.650> because<00:02:35.660> it's<00:02:36.660> hard<00:02:36.870> to<00:02:36.959> say<00:02:37.110> now<00:02:37.320> but

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
bottom because it's hard to say now but

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.050 
bottom because it's hard to say now but
we<00:02:37.709> actually<00:02:37.830> do<00:02:38.190> have<00:02:38.220> a<00:02:38.370> drop<00:02:38.580> shadow<00:02:38.820> there

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
we actually do have a drop shadow there

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.120 
we actually do have a drop shadow there
and<00:02:39.209> we<00:02:39.270> want<00:02:39.420> to<00:02:39.480> keep<00:02:39.630> it<00:02:39.750> there<00:02:39.989> so<00:02:40.860> just

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
and we want to keep it there so just

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.510 
and we want to keep it there so just
selecting<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.750> crop<00:02:43.050> tool<00:02:43.290> we're<00:02:44.280> just<00:02:44.370> going

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
selecting the crop tool we're just going

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.590 
selecting the crop tool we're just going
to<00:02:44.610> select<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:45.180> we're<00:02:45.750> going<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:46.050> move<00:02:46.410> it<00:02:46.590> to

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
to select and we're going to move it to

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.770 
to select and we're going to move it to
the<00:02:48.600> edges<00:02:48.900> of<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.140> zoom<00:02:49.500> in<00:02:49.650> so<00:02:49.800> you<00:02:49.830> can<00:02:50.040> see

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
the edges of the zoom in so you can see

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.390 
the edges of the zoom in so you can see
let<00:02:51.780> go<00:02:51.989> and<00:02:52.260> we<00:02:52.440> can<00:02:52.590> just<00:02:52.620> study<00:02:52.980> them<00:02:53.220> all

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
let go and we can just study them all

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.440 
let go and we can just study them all
now<00:02:53.580> if<00:02:54.510> i<00:02:54.630> zoom<00:02:54.660> in<00:02:55.760> we<00:02:56.760> want<00:02:56.880> to<00:02:57.000> bring<00:02:57.150> this

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
now if i zoom in we want to bring this

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:05.690 
now if i zoom in we want to bring this
into<00:02:59.540> in<00:03:00.540> a<00:03:01.020> bit<00:03:01.200> so<00:03:01.530> it<00:03:01.680> just<00:03:04.370> touches<00:03:05.370> the

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
into in a bit so it just touches the

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.240 
into in a bit so it just touches the
edge<00:03:05.850> and<00:03:06.180> at<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.480> top<00:03:06.660> we<00:03:07.560> want<00:03:07.770> to<00:03:07.860> push<00:03:08.040> this

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
edge and at the top we want to push this

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.140 
edge and at the top we want to push this
up<00:03:08.550> or<00:03:09.150> down<00:03:09.450> so<00:03:09.840> just<00:03:10.140> touch<00:03:10.320> up<00:03:10.350> the<00:03:10.500> top<00:03:10.830> of

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
up or down so just touch up the top of

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.280 
up or down so just touch up the top of
the<00:03:12.150> error<00:03:12.709> now<00:03:13.709> once<00:03:13.950> you<00:03:14.130> have<00:03:14.370> it<00:03:15.290> looking

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
the error now once you have it looking

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.190 
the error now once you have it looking
like<00:03:16.350> this<00:03:16.739> press<00:03:17.130> the<00:03:17.310> tick<00:03:17.549> and<00:03:18.019> we<00:03:19.019> will

like this press the tick and we will

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.789 
like this press the tick and we will
crop<00:03:19.610> the<00:03:20.610> image<00:03:21.170> and<00:03:22.170> looks<00:03:22.380> pretty<00:03:22.650> good<00:03:22.739> now

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
crop the image and looks pretty good now

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.620 
crop the image and looks pretty good now
so<00:03:23.730> what<00:03:23.850> we're<00:03:23.940> gonna<00:03:24.000> have<00:03:24.180> to<00:03:24.269> do<00:03:24.390> now<00:03:24.600> is

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
so what we're gonna have to do now is

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.229 
so what we're gonna have to do now is
save<00:03:25.049> it<00:03:25.260> and<00:03:25.459> to<00:03:26.459> do<00:03:26.580> this<00:03:26.760> we're<00:03:27.090> going<00:03:27.180> to

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
save it and to do this we're going to

shift ctrl alt NS so shift ctrl alt NS

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.900 
shift ctrl alt NS so shift ctrl alt NS
and<00:03:37.350> what<00:03:37.500> this<00:03:37.620> is<00:03:37.709> going<00:03:37.799> to<00:03:37.920> bring<00:03:38.100> up<00:03:38.430> is

and what this is going to bring up is
our<00:03:39.269> save<00:03:39.750> for<00:03:40.019> web<00:03:40.320> and<00:03:40.350> devices<00:03:40.739> if<00:03:41.700> that

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
our save for web and devices if that

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:43.729 
our save for web and devices if that
shortcut<00:03:42.630> was<00:03:42.750> a<00:03:42.780> bit<00:03:42.930> too<00:03:43.019> long<00:03:43.110> for<00:03:43.350> you<00:03:43.440> you

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
shortcut was a bit too long for you you

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.670 
shortcut was a bit too long for you you
can<00:03:43.890> go<00:03:44.040> to<00:03:44.100> file<00:03:44.430> and<00:03:45.350> save<00:03:46.350> for<00:03:46.530> web<00:03:46.650> and

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.759 
can go to file and save for web and
devices<00:03:48.470> ok<00:03:49.470> now<00:03:50.250> he<00:03:50.310> um<00:03:51.530> we're<00:03:52.530> going<00:03:52.709> to

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
devices ok now he um we're going to

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.890 
devices ok now he um we're going to
change<00:03:52.980> up<00:03:53.100> your<00:03:53.130> settings<00:03:53.519> firstly<00:03:54.420> we<00:03:54.660> can't

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
change up your settings firstly we can't

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.319 
change up your settings firstly we can't
give<00:03:55.049> it<00:03:55.140> a<00:03:55.200> JPEG<00:03:55.620> because<00:03:56.100> jpg<00:03:56.790> doesn't<00:03:57.120> allow

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
give it a JPEG because jpg doesn't allow

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.590 
give it a JPEG because jpg doesn't allow
transparency<00:03:58.110> so<00:03:58.470> we're<00:03:59.370> going<00:03:59.489> to<00:03:59.640> use<00:03:59.760> the

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
transparency so we're going to use the

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.190 
transparency so we're going to use the
PNG<00:04:01.140> and<00:04:01.290> I'm<00:04:01.680> going<00:04:01.799> to<00:04:01.860> use<00:04:01.980> a<00:04:02.070> PNG<00:04:02.430> a<00:04:02.730> bit<00:04:03.200> and

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
PNG and I'm going to use a PNG a bit and

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.830 
PNG and I'm going to use a PNG a bit and
actually<00:04:04.890> i'll<00:04:04.980> use<00:04:05.160> a<00:04:05.190> 24-bit<00:04:05.940> because<00:04:06.690> as

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
actually i'll use a 24-bit because as

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.090 
actually i'll use a 24-bit because as
you<00:04:06.959> can<00:04:07.110> see<00:04:07.820> this<00:04:08.820> um<00:04:09.470> it<00:04:10.470> is<00:04:10.650> still<00:04:11.010> not

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
you can see this um it is still not

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.580 
you can see this um it is still not
transparent<00:04:11.600> for<00:04:12.600> the<00:04:12.720> dropship<00:04:13.140> drop<00:04:13.380> shadow

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
transparent for the dropship drop shadow

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.480 
transparent for the dropship drop shadow
so<00:04:13.860> we<00:04:13.980> use<00:04:14.100> a<00:04:14.130> 24-bit

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.490 
so we use a 24-bit

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.699 
so we use a 24-bit
and<00:04:15.610> it's<00:04:16.600> hard<00:04:16.810> to<00:04:16.840> see<00:04:17.020> now<00:04:17.230> but<00:04:17.470> there<00:04:17.560> is<00:04:17.680> a

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
and it's hard to see now but there is a

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.660 
and it's hard to see now but there is a
drop<00:04:17.980> shadow<00:04:18.250> that<00:04:19.200> now<00:04:20.200> just<00:04:20.440> leave<00:04:20.650> it<00:04:20.830> took

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:21.670 
drop shadow that now just leave it took

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.940 
drop shadow that now just leave it took
on<00:04:21.850> transparency<00:04:22.540> if<00:04:23.020> not<00:04:23.380> we're<00:04:23.740> going<00:04:23.890> to
