laps to get to grips with each of the
bikes<00:02:06.060> that<00:02:06.299> we<00:02:06.420> give<00:02:06.600> him<00:02:06.780> but<00:02:07.409> he's<00:02:07.740> got<00:02:07.950> lots

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
bikes that we give him but he's got lots

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.430 
bikes that we give him but he's got lots
of<00:02:08.489> experience<00:02:08.759> with<00:02:09.270> this<00:02:09.420> model<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.319> he

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
of experience with this model so he

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.530 
of experience with this model so he
should<00:02:10.679> be<00:02:10.709> on<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.069> pace<00:02:11.250> immediately<00:02:14.540> he

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
should be on the pace immediately he

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.870 
should be on the pace immediately he
certainly<00:02:15.780> looks<00:02:16.170> fast<00:02:16.470> and<00:02:16.800> it<00:02:17.489> looks<00:02:17.670> like

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
certainly looks fast and it looks like

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.550 
certainly looks fast and it looks like
he's<00:02:18.120> getting<00:02:18.300> great<00:02:18.690> Drive<00:02:19.140> on<00:02:19.349> to<00:02:19.470> the

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
he's getting great Drive on to the

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.259 
he's getting great Drive on to the
start/finish<00:02:19.890> straight<00:02:20.190> but<00:02:21.060> we'll<00:02:21.239> the

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
start/finish straight but we'll the

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.600 
start/finish straight but we'll the
stopwatch<00:02:21.660> tell<00:02:22.319> a<00:02:22.349> different<00:02:22.800> story

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.750 

I'm<00:02:26.610> quite<00:02:26.880> surprised<00:02:27.330> at<00:02:27.510> that<00:02:28.099> 800<00:02:29.099> cc<00:02:29.550> bike

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
I'm quite surprised at that 800 cc bike

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.479 
I'm quite surprised at that 800 cc bike
about<00:02:30.750> a<00:02:30.780> second<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.319> a<00:02:31.380> half<00:02:31.410> slower<00:02:32.040> only

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
about a second and a half slower only

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.309 
about a second and a half slower only
than<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.700> thousand<00:02:33.150> CC<00:02:33.269> Superbike<00:02:33.900> what<00:02:34.110> gives

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
than a thousand CC Superbike what gives

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.140 
than a thousand CC Superbike what gives
that<00:02:34.380> I<00:02:34.739> think<00:02:34.950> this<00:02:35.069> to<00:02:35.280> practice<00:02:35.489> re<00:02:35.910> number

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
that I think this to practice re number

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.670 
that I think this to practice re number
one<00:02:36.360> is<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.600> fact<00:02:36.720> that<00:02:36.840> Clinton<00:02:37.260> seller<00:02:37.500> is

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
one is the fact that Clinton seller is

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.559 
one is the fact that Clinton seller is
very<00:02:37.890> much<00:02:38.040> part<00:02:38.310> of<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.549> MV<00:02:38.819> Agusta<00:02:39.030> Empire

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
very much part of the MV Agusta Empire

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.059 
very much part of the MV Agusta Empire
if<00:02:39.750> you<00:02:39.840> like<00:02:39.959> here<00:02:40.200> in<00:02:40.290> South<00:02:40.470> Africa<00:02:40.830> so<00:02:40.950> he's

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
if you like here in South Africa so he's

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.220 
if you like here in South Africa so he's
very<00:02:41.340> familiar<00:02:41.910> with<00:02:41.970> that<00:02:42.180> machine<00:02:42.299> already

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
very familiar with that machine already

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.170 
very familiar with that machine already
and<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:43.950> other<00:02:44.069> is<00:02:44.280> just<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.670> nature<00:02:44.819> of<00:02:44.970> red

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
and the other is just the nature of red

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.759 
and the other is just the nature of red
star<00:02:45.390> Raceway<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.840> bit<00:02:46.260> of<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:46.410> track<00:02:46.620> that

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
star Raceway the bit of the track that

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.559 
star Raceway the bit of the track that
we<00:02:46.890> use<00:02:47.100> is<00:02:47.280> particularly<00:02:48.120> tight<00:02:48.330> and<00:02:48.510> twisty

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
we use is particularly tight and twisty

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.110 
we use is particularly tight and twisty
so<00:02:49.380> it<00:02:49.500> favours<00:02:50.040> handling<00:02:50.459> over<00:02:50.670> outright

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
so it favours handling over outright

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.090 
so it favours handling over outright
power<00:02:51.390> BMW<00:02:52.049> just<00:02:52.110> can't<00:02:52.350> use<00:02:52.590> all<00:02:52.769> this<00:02:52.860> power

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
power BMW just can't use all this power

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.000 
power BMW just can't use all this power
exactly<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:54.110> envy<00:02:55.110> can<00:02:55.260> I<00:02:55.319> see<00:02:55.440> use<00:02:55.560> most<00:02:55.860> of

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
exactly the envy can I see use most of

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.509 
exactly the envy can I see use most of
its<00:02:56.160> power

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
its power

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.850 
its power
yeah<00:02:56.910> absolutely<00:02:57.540> bang-on<00:02:57.900> it's<00:02:58.080> not<00:02:58.290> often

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
yeah absolutely bang-on it's not often

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.259 
yeah absolutely bang-on it's not often
that<00:02:58.920> Harry<00:02:59.250> is<00:02:59.400> that<00:02:59.430> right<00:02:59.790> so<00:02:59.940> I<00:03:00.000> think<00:03:00.030> we

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
that Harry is that right so I think we

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.059 
that Harry is that right so I think we
should<00:03:00.299> end<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:00.750> show<00:03:00.959> right<00:03:01.230> now<00:03:01.290> I<00:03:01.739> hope

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
should end the show right now I hope

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.620 
should end the show right now I hope
