00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
and I hate loose-leaf paper because it

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.450 
and I hate loose-leaf paper because it
gets<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:49.259> messy<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:49.920> just<00:01:50.130> like<00:01:50.250> having

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460
