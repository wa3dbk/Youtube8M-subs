00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.260 
that's about a quarter of an inch wide
and<00:00:57.960> they're<00:00:58.920> excellent<00:00:59.399> for<00:00:59.730> being<00:00:59.940> able<00:01:00.090> to

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
and they're excellent for being able to

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
plenty of working room but this just

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.499 
plenty of working room but this just
helps<00:01:29.939> reduce<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.920> opportunity<00:01:31.920> for<00:01:32.130> error

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.609 
bottom up so that the seams end up being
more<00:02:00.030> invisible<00:02:00.420> because<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.960> can't<00:02:01.229> see<00:02:01.469> the

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
more invisible because you can't see the

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.560 
more invisible because you can't see the
hard<00:02:01.829> edges<00:02:02.100> from<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.549> top<00:02:02.850> if<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.240> look<00:02:03.420> from

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
hard edges from the top if you look from

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.300 
hard edges from the top if you look from
the<00:02:03.689> bottom<00:02:03.869> you're<00:02:04.469> more<00:02:04.649> likely<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.130> see<00:02:05.280> the

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
the bottom you're more likely to see the

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.919 
the bottom you're more likely to see the
edges<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.000> also<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:07.680> generally<00:02:08.220> cover<00:02:08.489> from

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
edges and also you generally cover from

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.860 
edges and also you generally cover from
back-to-front<00:02:09.379> so<00:02:10.129> that<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:10.489> seams<00:02:10.789> end<00:02:11.299> up

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
back-to-front so that the seams end up

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.869 
back-to-front so that the seams end up
running<00:02:12.200> towards<00:02:12.739> the<00:02:12.890> back<00:02:13.040> of<00:02:13.069> the<00:02:13.280> plane<00:02:13.549> so

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:13.879 
running towards the back of the plane so

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:15.490 
running towards the back of the plane so
when<00:02:14.060> you<00:02:14.150> look<00:02:14.329> at<00:02:14.480> it<00:02:14.659> from<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:15.079> from<00:02:15.379> the

when you look at it from the from the
front<00:02:15.739> on<00:02:16.010> they're<00:02:16.819> not<00:02:16.969> quite<00:02:17.239> as<00:02:17.269> visible

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810

now<00:02:17.989> with<00:02:18.140> this<00:02:18.560> kind<00:02:18.890> of<00:02:18.980> a<00:02:19.129> paint<00:02:19.760> and<00:02:20.180> dope

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
now with this kind of a paint and dope

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.140 
now with this kind of a paint and dope
finish<00:02:21.250> their<00:02:22.250> seams<00:02:22.489> are<00:02:22.670> going<00:02:22.700> to<00:02:22.849> be<00:02:22.969> made

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.940 
finish their seams are going to be made
invisible<00:02:23.510> generally<00:02:24.290> anyway<00:02:24.590> because<00:02:24.769> you

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
invisible generally anyway because you

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.970 
invisible generally anyway because you
can<00:02:25.129> have<00:02:25.370> enough<00:02:25.639> dope<00:02:26.359> over<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:26.989> overlap

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
can have enough dope over the overlap

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.190 
can have enough dope over the overlap
area<00:02:28.219> if<00:02:28.549> you<00:02:28.639> can<00:02:28.670> stand<00:02:29.030> it<00:02:29.209> smooth<00:02:29.599> if

you're using one of the iron or one
finishes<00:02:31.969> like<00:02:32.150> Monaco<00:02:33.109> the<00:02:33.409> same<00:02:33.680> technique

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
finishes like Monaco the same technique

applies because with that you cannot
make<00:02:37.579> the<00:02:37.760> seams<00:02:38.000> disappear<00:02:38.569> unless<00:02:38.840> you<00:02:39.049> put

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
make the seams disappear unless you put

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.490 
make the seams disappear unless you put
trim<00:02:39.530> tape<00:02:39.769> over<00:02:40.219> it<00:02:40.480> and<00:02:41.480> then<00:02:41.750> that<00:02:41.900> just<00:02:41.930> is

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
trim tape over it and then that just is

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.039 
trim tape over it and then that just is
a<00:02:42.730> general<00:02:43.730> guideline<00:02:44.030> on<00:02:44.450> how<00:02:44.569> to<00:02:44.629> do<00:02:44.810> it<00:02:44.840> it's

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
a general guideline on how to do it it's

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.710 
a general guideline on how to do it it's
the<00:02:45.079> same<00:02:45.319> thing<00:02:45.379> when<00:02:45.739> people<00:02:45.769> put<00:02:46.720> vinyl

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
the same thing when people put vinyl

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.770 
the same thing when people put vinyl
siding<00:02:48.319> on<00:02:48.439> the<00:02:48.530> side<00:02:48.739> of<00:02:48.889> your<00:02:48.950> house<00:02:49.159> they

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
siding on the side of your house they

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.599 
siding on the side of your house they
overlap<00:02:50.780> it<00:02:51.019> so<00:02:51.260> that<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:51.739> joints<00:02:52.280> aren't

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:52.609 
overlap it so that the joints aren't

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:55.390 
overlap it so that the joints aren't
viewable<00:02:53.510> from<00:02:53.750> the<00:02:53.959> primary<00:02:54.590> viewing<00:02:55.129> point

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.899 
say the front door or the back porch I'm
gonna<00:03:00.019> continue<00:03:00.620> to<00:03:00.739> give<00:03:00.889> you<00:03:01.040> a<00:03:01.069> quick<00:03:01.609> look

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:01.909 
gonna continue to give you a quick look

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:04.240 
gonna continue to give you a quick look
around<00:03:02.060> here<00:03:02.569> now<00:03:02.719> this<00:03:03.290> is<00:03:03.349> electric<00:03:03.980> power

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
around here now this is electric power

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.610 
around here now this is electric power
the<00:03:05.120> battery<00:03:05.269> will<00:03:05.719> sit<00:03:05.930> up<00:03:06.049> against<00:03:06.439> this

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
the battery will sit up against this

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.280 
the battery will sit up against this
stop<00:03:07.040> on<00:03:07.400> the<00:03:07.669> front<00:03:07.969> from<00:03:08.180> underneath<00:03:08.480> and

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
stop on the front from underneath and

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.589 
stop on the front from underneath and
I've<00:03:09.379> just<00:03:09.530> left<00:03:09.859> this<00:03:10.040> open<00:03:10.189> area<00:03:11.150> here<00:03:11.209> it'll

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
I've just left this open area here it'll

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.149 
I've just left this open area here it'll
make<00:03:11.780> it<00:03:11.900> a<00:03:11.959> lot<00:03:12.109> easier<00:03:12.139> to<00:03:12.739> get<00:03:12.889> to<00:03:13.040> the

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:13.159 
make it a lot easier to get to the

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:15.460 
make it a lot easier to get to the
battery<00:03:13.370> for<00:03:13.849> replacement<00:03:14.510> and<00:03:14.690> I'll<00:03:15.109> also

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
battery for replacement and I'll also

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.439 
battery for replacement and I'll also
facilitate<00:03:16.190> the<00:03:16.430> cooling<00:03:17.060> which<00:03:17.209> really

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:17.449 
facilitate the cooling which really

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:19.149 
facilitate the cooling which really
shouldn't<00:03:17.750> be<00:03:17.930> a<00:03:17.959> problem<00:03:18.470> here<00:03:18.680> because<00:03:18.859> I've

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:19.159 
shouldn't be a problem here because I've

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:21.580 
shouldn't be a problem here because I've
got<00:03:19.190> the<00:03:20.030> open<00:03:20.419> cockpit<00:03:20.690> and<00:03:21.260> plenty<00:03:21.560> of

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
got the open cockpit and plenty of

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.589 
got the open cockpit and plenty of
opportunity<00:03:22.340> for<00:03:22.370> the<00:03:22.790> herring<00:03:23.150> to<00:03:23.209> escape

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
opportunity for the herring to escape

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.259 
opportunity for the herring to escape
but<00:03:24.409> this<00:03:25.010> just<00:03:25.220> makes<00:03:25.400> it<00:03:25.579> a<00:03:25.669> lot<00:03:25.790> easier<00:03:25.849> I

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
but this just makes it a lot easier I

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:27.580 
but this just makes it a lot easier I
don't<00:03:26.329> have<00:03:26.599> to<00:03:26.720> bother<00:03:26.900> with<00:03:27.169> putting<00:03:27.409> any

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
don't have to bother with putting any

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.050 
don't have to bother with putting any
kind<00:03:27.829> of<00:03:27.889> a<00:03:27.979> hatch<00:03:28.220> on<00:03:28.489> it<00:03:29.109> on<00:03:30.109> the<00:03:30.500> back<00:03:30.739> I<00:03:31.189> like

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
kind of a hatch on it on the back I like

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.110 
kind of a hatch on it on the back I like
to<00:03:32.269> put<00:03:32.569> my<00:03:33.379> hinges<00:03:33.919> in<00:03:34.159> first<00:03:34.639> to<00:03:34.939> make<00:03:35.060> sure

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
to put my hinges in first to make sure

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.349 
to put my hinges in first to make sure
everything's<00:03:35.780> nice<00:03:36.049> and<00:03:36.109> bine<00:03:36.739> free<00:03:37.340> and<00:03:38.120> when

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359 
everything's nice and bine free and when

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:40.240 
everything's nice and bine free and when
I<00:03:38.389> do<00:03:38.509> the<00:03:38.870> finish<00:03:39.259> I<00:03:39.530> don't<00:03:39.739> have<00:03:39.889> to<00:03:40.040> worry

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
I do the finish I don't have to worry

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.770 
I do the finish I don't have to worry
about<00:03:40.569> the<00:03:41.569> pin<00:03:42.500> hinge<00:03:43.069> area<00:03:43.459> is<00:03:43.549> getting

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
about the pin hinge area is getting

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.420 
about the pin hinge area is getting
infiltrated<00:03:44.780> with<00:03:44.959> either<00:03:45.139> the<00:03:45.439> glue<00:03:46.040> during

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
infiltrated with either the glue during

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.909 
infiltrated with either the glue during
installation<00:03:47.120> or<00:03:47.299> the<00:03:47.599> dope<00:03:47.840> so<00:03:48.530> I'll<00:03:48.680> just

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:48.919 
installation or the dope so I'll just

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:51.670 
installation or the dope so I'll just
run<00:03:49.159> the<00:03:49.340> pins<00:03:49.669> through<00:03:50.060> these<00:03:50.560> when<00:03:51.560> I'm

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
run the pins through these when I'm

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:52.949 
run the pins through these when I'm
ready<00:03:51.889> to<00:03:52.040> go<00:03:52.189> just<00:03:52.430> to<00:03:52.549> clean<00:03:52.759> any

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
ready to go just to clean any

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.390 
ready to go just to clean any
accumulation<00:03:53.959> out<00:03:54.109> of<00:03:54.169> there<00:03:54.470> and<00:03:55.009> then<00:03:55.280> I'll

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
accumulation out of there and then I'll

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.099 
accumulation out of there and then I'll
insert<00:03:55.759> the<00:03:55.970> pins<00:03:56.209> and<00:03:56.449> just<00:03:56.509> take<00:03:56.840> a<00:03:56.870> small

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:57.109 
insert the pins and just take a small

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:00.460 
insert the pins and just take a small
pair<00:03:57.560> of<00:03:57.650> needlenose<00:03:57.949> and<00:03:58.489> twist<00:03:59.150> the<00:03:59.479> end<00:04:00.229> a

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
pair of needlenose and twist the end a

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.170 
pair of needlenose and twist the end a
little<00:04:00.590> bit<00:04:00.739> so<00:04:01.009> it<00:04:01.129> can't<00:04:01.370> come<00:04:01.459> out<00:04:01.639> and

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
little bit so it can't come out and

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.030 
little bit so it can't come out and
everything<00:04:02.840> will<00:04:02.959> be<00:04:03.079> fine<00:04:03.349> it<00:04:03.769> makes

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
everything will be fine it makes

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.550 
everything will be fine it makes
coverage<00:04:04.609> so<00:04:04.909> much<00:04:05.120> easier<00:04:05.540> doing<00:04:06.169> it<00:04:06.409> that

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
coverage so much easier doing it that

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.749 
coverage so much easier doing it that
way<00:04:07.359> and<00:04:08.590> so<00:04:09.590> the<00:04:09.739> next<00:04:09.919> step<00:04:10.250> is<00:04:10.430> going<00:04:10.609> to<00:04:10.699> be

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:10.759 
way and so the next step is going to be

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:13.330 
way and so the next step is going to be
actually<00:04:11.449> starting<00:04:11.930> the<00:04:11.959> full<00:04:12.620> brush<00:04:12.949> coats

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
actually starting the full brush coats

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.979 
actually starting the full brush coats
again<00:04:14.090> I'll<00:04:14.389> use<00:04:14.470> 5050<00:04:15.470> thin<00:04:16.690> nitrate<00:04:17.690> dope

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
again I'll use 5050 thin nitrate dope

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:18.580 
again I'll use 5050 thin nitrate dope
for<00:04:18.289> that

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
for that

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.409 
for that
for<00:04:18.950> reasons<00:04:19.400> that<00:04:19.489> were<00:04:19.609> explained<00:04:20.030> in<00:04:20.269> the

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
for reasons that were explained in the

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.080 
for reasons that were explained in the
one<00:04:20.959> of<00:04:20.989> the<00:04:21.079> earlier<00:04:21.470> films<00:04:21.859> that<00:04:22.580> has<00:04:22.790> to<00:04:22.940> do

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
one of the earlier films that has to do

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.540 
one of the earlier films that has to do
with<00:04:23.270> the<00:04:23.540> the<00:04:24.260> shrinking<00:04:24.770> properties<00:04:25.340> of

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
with the the shrinking properties of

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.780 
with the the shrinking properties of
nitrate<00:04:26.030> versus<00:04:26.510> butyrate<00:04:26.870> and<00:04:27.580> once<00:04:28.580> that's

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
nitrate versus butyrate and once that's

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.490 
nitrate versus butyrate and once that's
all<00:04:29.000> done<00:04:29.030> I'll<00:04:29.780> have<00:04:29.960> it<00:04:30.110> all<00:04:30.230> nice<00:04:30.470> and

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
all done I'll have it all nice and

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.220 
all done I'll have it all nice and
sanded<00:04:31.130> when<00:04:31.280> I<00:04:31.370> come<00:04:31.580> back<00:04:31.790> again<00:04:32.150> and<00:04:32.630> I'll

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
sanded when I come back again and I'll

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:34.990 
sanded when I come back again and I'll
be<00:04:33.470> at<00:04:33.710> the<00:04:33.830> point<00:04:34.100> where<00:04:34.250> I'm<00:04:34.340> ready<00:04:34.490> to<00:04:34.730> put

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
be at the point where I'm ready to put

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.840 
be at the point where I'm ready to put
the<00:04:35.150> base<00:04:35.389> color<00:04:35.900> code<00:04:36.260> which<00:04:36.560> on<00:04:36.860> the<00:04:37.370> camel

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
the base color code which on the camel

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.629 
the base color code which on the camel
is<00:04:37.970> going<00:04:38.180> to<00:04:38.240> be<00:04:38.419> an<00:04:38.510> olive<00:04:38.660> drab<00:04:39.639> butyrate

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 
is going to be an olive drab butyrate

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.270 
is going to be an olive drab butyrate
dope<00:04:40.700> then<00:04:41.270> again<00:04:41.510> on<00:04:41.660> an<00:04:41.750> earlier<00:04:42.139> film<00:04:43.070> I

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
dope then again on an earlier film I

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.340 
dope then again on an earlier film I
talked<00:04:43.490> about<00:04:43.520> why<00:04:44.090> I'm<00:04:44.270> using<00:04:44.690> butyl<00:04:45.200> ready

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
talked about why I'm using butyl ready

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.860 
talked about why I'm using butyl ready
over<00:04:45.560> the<00:04:45.650> top<00:04:45.860> of<00:04:46.040> the<00:04:46.100> nitrate<00:04:46.550> so<00:04:47.300> I'll<00:04:47.690> see

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
over the top of the nitrate so I'll see

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.740 
over the top of the nitrate so I'll see
you<00:04:47.990> back<00:04:48.139> in<00:04:48.530> probably<00:04:49.190> three<00:04:50.090> or<00:04:50.120> four<00:04:50.240> weeks

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
you back in probably three or four weeks

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.420 
you back in probably three or four weeks
by<00:04:51.020> the<00:04:51.139> time<00:04:51.380> this<00:04:51.560> is<00:04:51.620> all<00:04:51.889> ready<00:04:52.130> to<00:04:52.280> go

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
by the time this is all ready to go

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.450 
by the time this is all ready to go
maybe<00:04:52.729> a<00:04:52.850> little<00:04:53.030> sooner<00:04:53.270> and<00:04:54.250> we'll<00:04:55.250> finish

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
maybe a little sooner and we'll finish

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.540 
maybe a little sooner and we'll finish
up<00:04:55.729> thank<00:04:56.389> you
