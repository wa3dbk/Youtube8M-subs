Institute we opened in october two
thousand<00:00:35.589> eight<00:00:35.710> although<00:00:36.640> we've<00:00:36.789> been

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:36.969 
thousand eight although we've been

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:40.349 
thousand eight although we've been
programming<00:00:37.449> and<00:00:38.010> doing<00:00:39.010> commissions<00:00:39.359> for

00:00:40.349 --> 00:00:40.359 
programming and doing commissions for

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:43.889 
programming and doing commissions for
several<00:00:41.079> years<00:00:41.319> before<00:00:41.800> that<00:00:42.030> i<00:00:43.030> arrived<00:00:43.600> here

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:43.899 
several years before that i arrived here

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:48.869 
several years before that i arrived here
in<00:00:44.109> 2005<00:00:45.269> so<00:00:46.269> mpac<00:00:47.079> was<00:00:47.949> created<00:00:48.579> on<00:00:48.729> the

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
in 2005 so mpac was created on the

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.079 
in 2005 so mpac was created on the
campus<00:00:49.299> of<00:00:49.449> Rensselaer<00:00:50.019> to<00:00:50.920> be<00:00:51.129> similar<00:00:51.639> to<00:00:51.850> a

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:52.089 
campus of Rensselaer to be similar to a

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:54.689 
campus of Rensselaer to be similar to a
research<00:00:52.510> center<00:00:53.109> so<00:00:53.859> what<00:00:54.219> I<00:00:54.249> mean<00:00:54.489> by<00:00:54.549> that

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
research center so what I mean by that

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.069 
research center so what I mean by that
is<00:00:54.909> it's<00:00:55.479> not<00:00:55.809> actually<00:00:56.589> an<00:00:56.859> academic

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
is it's not actually an academic

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.229 
is it's not actually an academic
institution<00:00:59.079> in<00:00:59.709> that<00:00:59.889> classes<00:01:00.459> don't<00:01:00.940> take

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
institution in that classes don't take

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.599 
institution in that classes don't take
place<00:01:01.569> here<00:01:01.600> and<00:01:02.469> it's<00:01:02.889> not<00:01:03.069> built<00:01:03.280> for

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:03.609 
place here and it's not built for

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:04.950 
place here and it's not built for
student<00:01:03.969> work<00:01:04.150> although<00:01:04.570> students

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
student work although students

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.260 
student work although students
definitely<00:01:05.680> do<00:01:05.860> interact<00:01:06.400> with<00:01:06.580> it<00:01:06.700> back<00:01:07.000> and

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
definitely do interact with it back and

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.690 
definitely do interact with it back and
have<00:01:07.510> performances<00:01:08.200> here<00:01:08.530> and<00:01:08.770> artists<00:01:09.520> than

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
have performances here and artists than

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.600 
have performances here and artists than
my<00:01:09.790> dad<00:01:10.000> but<00:01:10.930> mpec<00:01:11.410> was<00:01:11.620> really<00:01:11.890> created<00:01:12.310> to<00:01:12.460> be

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
my dad but mpec was really created to be

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.780 
my dad but mpec was really created to be
a<00:01:12.640> place<00:01:13.030> of<00:01:13.300> production<00:01:14.020> to<00:01:14.770> make<00:01:15.280> new<00:01:15.550> work

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
a place of production to make new work

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.830 
a place of production to make new work
happen<00:01:16.300> and<00:01:16.960> to<00:01:17.650> allow<00:01:18.250> for<00:01:18.580> a<00:01:19.240> research

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
happen and to allow for a research

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.230 
happen and to allow for a research
platform<00:01:20.200> for<00:01:21.040> work<00:01:21.550> in<00:01:22.410> that<00:01:23.410> uses

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
platform for work in that uses

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.870 
platform for work in that uses
technology<00:01:25.350> but<00:01:26.350> MPAC<00:01:26.830> has<00:01:27.250> a<00:01:27.280> pretty

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
technology but MPAC has a pretty

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.670 
technology but MPAC has a pretty
phenomenal<00:01:28.230> infrastructure<00:01:29.230> for<00:01:29.560> the

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
phenomenal infrastructure for the

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.970 
phenomenal infrastructure for the
support<00:01:30.040> of<00:01:30.340> work<00:01:30.730> with<00:01:31.510> technology<00:01:31.810> which<00:01:32.680> is

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:32.980 
support of work with technology which is

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.850 
support of work with technology which is
why<00:01:33.670> we<00:01:33.910> wanted<00:01:34.240> to<00:01:34.270> do<00:01:34.450> workshops<00:01:34.780> because<00:01:35.380> we

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
why we wanted to do workshops because we

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.610 
why we wanted to do workshops because we
have<00:01:36.070> an<00:01:36.250> infrastructure<00:01:36.460> that

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:37.620 
have an infrastructure that

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.580 
have an infrastructure that
rare<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:39.120> we<00:01:39.570> wanted<00:01:39.870> to<00:01:39.990> give<00:01:40.140> artists

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
rare that we wanted to give artists

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.520 
rare that we wanted to give artists
access<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.310> somehow<00:01:41.900> in<00:01:42.900> a<00:01:43.080> different<00:01:43.410> way

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
access to somehow in a different way

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.400 
access to somehow in a different way
than<00:01:43.860> for<00:01:44.220> residency<00:01:44.850> so<00:01:45.210> we<00:01:45.570> decided<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.290> in

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
than for residency so we decided that in

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.620 
than for residency so we decided that in
the<00:01:46.500> summer<00:01:46.680> time<00:01:46.950> we<00:01:47.790> would<00:01:48.030> want<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.480> do

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
the summer time we would want to do

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.750 
the summer time we would want to do
workshops<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.040> workshop<00:01:50.400> that<00:01:50.580> we're

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
workshops and so the workshop that we're

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.820 
workshops and so the workshop that we're
doing<00:01:50.970> right<00:01:51.090> now<00:01:51.150> is<00:01:51.330> called<00:01:51.930> live<00:01:52.200> media<00:01:52.470> and

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
doing right now is called live media and

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.480 
doing right now is called live media and
performance<00:01:53.460> lab<00:01:54.050> and<00:01:55.050> it's<00:01:55.410> taught<00:01:55.650> by<00:01:55.680> Mark

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
performance lab and it's taught by Mark

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.070 
performance lab and it's taught by Mark
coniglio<00:01:56.940> and<00:01:57.120> Johannes<00:01:57.480> berenguer<00:01:57.900> and

coniglio and Johannes berenguer and

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.660 
coniglio and Johannes berenguer and
we're<00:01:58.290> really<00:01:58.650> excited<00:01:58.800> to<00:01:59.340> have<00:01:59.460> both<00:01:59.610> of

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
we're really excited to have both of

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.690 
we're really excited to have both of
them<00:01:59.910> here<00:02:00.210> it's<00:02:00.840> based<00:02:01.230> in<00:02:01.700> interactive

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
them here it's based in interactive

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.140 
them here it's based in interactive
media<00:02:02.730> so<00:02:03.890> it's<00:02:04.890> not<00:02:05.070> just<00:02:05.130> video<00:02:05.820> in

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
media so it's not just video in

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.060 
media so it's not just video in
performance<00:02:06.660> but<00:02:06.840> how<00:02:07.050> is<00:02:07.230> that<00:02:07.260> video<00:02:07.590> going

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
performance but how is that video going

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.940 
performance but how is that video going
to<00:02:08.190> interact<00:02:08.520> with<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.119> performers<00:02:09.770> it<00:02:10.770> was

leading this workshop at empac it's a

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.740 
leading this workshop at empac it's a
workshop<00:03:08.819> that<00:03:09.150> is<00:03:09.450> both<00:03:09.870> about<00:03:11.750> theoretical

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
workshop that is both about theoretical

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.280 
workshop that is both about theoretical
and<00:03:13.500> aesthetic<00:03:14.040> concerns<00:03:14.370> of<00:03:14.640> creating

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
and aesthetic concerns of creating

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.990 
and aesthetic concerns of creating
performances<00:03:16.290> that<00:03:16.530> are<00:03:16.799> media<00:03:17.250> intensive<00:03:17.760> as

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
performances that are media intensive as

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.270 
performances that are media intensive as
well<00:03:18.299> as<00:03:18.480> hitting<00:03:19.019> on<00:03:19.230> practical<00:03:19.859> concerns

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
well as hitting on practical concerns

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.849 
well as hitting on practical concerns
and<00:03:20.639> really<00:03:21.480> I<00:03:21.510> think<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:22.139> most<00:03:22.319> important

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
and really I think the most important

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.280 
and really I think the most important
thing<00:03:22.920> is<00:03:23.280> that<00:03:23.310> people<00:03:23.810> are<00:03:24.810> in<00:03:25.049> a

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
thing is that people are in a

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.580 
thing is that people are in a
collaborative<00:03:26.299> environment<00:03:27.299> were<00:03:28.079> that<00:03:28.409> kind

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
collaborative environment were that kind

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.619 
collaborative environment were that kind
of<00:03:28.739> relationship<00:03:28.950> between<00:03:29.519> the<00:03:29.700> workshop

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:30.629 
of relationship between the workshop

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:40.309 
of relationship between the workshop
participants<00:03:31.109> is<00:03:31.349> encouraged<00:03:38.930> he<00:03:39.930> made<00:03:40.139> me

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
participants is encouraged he made me

17 18 artists working collaboratively
together<00:04:40.789> there<00:04:41.789> is<00:04:41.940> definitely<00:04:41.970> a<00:04:42.509> place<00:04:42.870> for

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590

exchange<00:04:49.320> ideas<00:04:49.650> I<00:04:50.070> think<00:04:50.310> that<00:04:50.520> definitely

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
exchange ideas I think that definitely

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.110 
exchange ideas I think that definitely
is<00:04:51.509> still<00:04:51.900> needed<00:04:52.259> but<00:04:52.860> I<00:04:52.919> think<00:04:53.430> that<00:04:53.820> in

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
is still needed but I think that in

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.840 
is still needed but I think that in
terms<00:04:54.150> of<00:04:54.690> how<00:04:54.960> the<00:04:55.020> work<00:04:55.470> functions<00:04:56.130> in<00:04:56.400> the

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
terms of how the work functions in the

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.379 
terms of how the work functions in the
real<00:04:57.210> world<00:04:57.449> the<00:04:57.840> context<00:04:58.380> response<00:04:58.800> yeah

00:04:59.379 --> 00:04:59.389 
real world the context response yeah

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:03.520 
real world the context response yeah
that<00:05:00.389> really<00:05:00.840> it<00:05:01.259> belongs<00:05:01.889> in<00:05:02.220> any<00:05:02.430> festival

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
that really it belongs in any festival

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.499 
that really it belongs in any festival
alongside<00:05:04.530> other<00:05:05.340> works<00:05:05.639> that<00:05:05.789> perhaps<00:05:06.150> don't

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:06.509 
alongside other works that perhaps don't

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:09.409 
alongside other works that perhaps don't
engage<00:05:06.990> technology<00:05:07.800> yes<00:05:08.520> you<00:05:09.090> know<00:05:09.210> you'll

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
engage technology yes you know you'll

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:12.320 
engage technology yes you know you'll
see<00:05:09.770> many<00:05:10.770> of<00:05:10.979> them<00:05:11.100> are<00:05:11.280> starting<00:05:11.639> at<00:05:11.759> the<00:05:11.789> in

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
see many of them are starting at the in

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:13.610 
see many of them are starting at the in
a<00:05:12.449> way<00:05:12.570> at<00:05:12.720> the<00:05:12.810> beginning<00:05:12.930> they're<00:05:13.380> doing

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
a way at the beginning they're doing

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.200 
a way at the beginning they're doing
things<00:05:13.830> that<00:05:14.130> we've<00:05:14.340> seen<00:05:14.580> before<00:05:14.940> and<00:05:15.150> the

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
things that we've seen before and the

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.120 
things that we've seen before and the
meal<00:05:15.449> that's<00:05:15.990> not<00:05:16.199> the<00:05:16.320> important<00:05:16.770> thing<00:05:16.830> I

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
meal that's not the important thing I

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.770 
meal that's not the important thing I
think<00:05:17.160> that<00:05:17.580> we<00:05:18.030> all<00:05:18.180> have<00:05:18.210> to<00:05:18.389> start<00:05:18.630> at<00:05:18.750> the

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
think that we all have to start at the

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.020 
think that we all have to start at the
beginning<00:05:18.960> at<00:05:19.229> some<00:05:19.470> point<00:05:19.740> it's<00:05:20.039> that<00:05:20.580> we<00:05:20.850> are

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
beginning at some point it's that we are

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.659 
beginning at some point it's that we are
pushing<00:05:21.870> as<00:05:22.139> hard<00:05:22.169> as<00:05:22.440> we<00:05:22.560> can<00:05:22.800> in<00:05:23.250> the<00:05:23.430> short

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
pushing as hard as we can in the short

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:26.180 
pushing as hard as we can in the short
time<00:05:23.910> that<00:05:23.970> we<00:05:24.210> have<00:05:24.419> for<00:05:25.050> really<00:05:25.560> a<00:05:25.590> rigorous

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
time that we have for really a rigorous

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.219 
time that we have for really a rigorous
consideration<00:05:26.970> of<00:05:27.090> what's<00:05:27.300> there<00:05:27.539> isn't

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:28.229 
consideration of what's there isn't

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:29.629 
consideration of what's there isn't
working<00:05:28.620> you<00:05:28.740> know<00:05:28.770> and<00:05:29.010> to<00:05:29.070> be<00:05:29.100> unafraid<00:05:29.550> to

working you know and to be unafraid to

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:32.060 
working you know and to be unafraid to
critique<00:05:30.090> it<00:05:30.240> we've<00:05:30.419> you<00:05:30.870> know<00:05:30.900> last<00:05:31.800> night

critique it we've you know last night

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.129 
critique it we've you know last night
they<00:05:32.220> put<00:05:32.400> together<00:05:32.520> a<00:05:32.760> small<00:05:33.479> piece<00:05:33.900> and<00:05:34.080> it

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:34.139 
they put together a small piece and it

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:35.330 
they put together a small piece and it
was<00:05:34.229> actually<00:05:34.380> several<00:05:34.860> people<00:05:35.190> were

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
involved and so this was they just threw

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.310 
involved and so this was they just threw
it<00:05:38.550> together<00:05:38.699> in<00:05:39.120> a<00:05:39.180> moment<00:05:39.570> and<00:05:39.750> if<00:05:39.810> I'd<00:05:39.960> loved

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
it together in a moment and if I'd loved

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.010 
it together in a moment and if I'd loved
it<00:05:40.500> you<00:05:40.650> know<00:05:40.770> the<00:05:40.860> way<00:05:40.949> like<00:05:41.130> wow<00:05:41.280> yeah<00:05:41.639> why

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 
not me at which point I I stood up and

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.089 
not me at which point I I stood up and
said<00:05:45.900> I<00:05:46.110> would<00:05:46.260> like<00:05:46.560> to<00:05:46.590> initiate<00:05:46.860> a

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:47.099 
said I would like to initiate a

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:48.350 
said I would like to initiate a
discussion<00:05:47.280> about<00:05:47.639> it<00:05:47.789> because<00:05:48.060> I<00:05:48.180> thought

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
discussion about it because I thought

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.460 
discussion about it because I thought
there<00:05:48.509> were<00:05:48.599> some<00:05:48.870> there<00:05:49.199> was<00:05:49.320> some

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
there were some there was some

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.469 
there were some there was some
weaknesses<00:05:49.949> that<00:05:50.009> we<00:05:50.370> should<00:05:50.550> address<00:05:51.120> and

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 
weaknesses that we should address and

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:53.930 
weaknesses that we should address and
talk<00:05:51.660> about<00:05:51.840> because<00:05:52.470> if<00:05:52.919> you're<00:05:53.520> not<00:05:53.669> pushing

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
talk about because if you're not pushing

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.490 
talk about because if you're not pushing
that<00:05:54.180> rigor<00:05:54.510> then<00:05:54.870> they're<00:05:55.020> not<00:05:55.199> going<00:05:55.260> to

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
that rigor then they're not going to

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.839 
that rigor then they're not going to
take<00:05:55.680> the<00:05:55.800> next<00:05:55.979> step<00:05:56.070> when<00:05:56.370> they<00:05:56.490> leave<00:05:56.699> this

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:56.849 
take the next step when they leave this

00:05:56.849 --> 00:05:58.640 
take the next step when they leave this
room<00:05:57.090> this<00:05:57.419> is<00:05:57.570> not<00:05:57.750> anything<00:05:58.050> that<00:05:58.289> anybody

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
room this is not anything that anybody

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.529 
room this is not anything that anybody
should<00:05:58.830> take<00:05:59.130> personally<00:05:59.610> it's<00:06:00.030> not<00:06:00.240> like<00:06:00.389> we

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:00.539 
should take personally it's not like we

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:02.180 
should take personally it's not like we
you<00:06:00.930> know<00:06:01.020> you're<00:06:01.169> showing<00:06:01.410> the<00:06:01.530> results<00:06:01.770> of<00:06:02.070> a

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
you know you're showing the results of a

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.100 
you know you're showing the results of a
year<00:06:02.400> of<00:06:02.520> work<00:06:02.550> and<00:06:02.970> that's<00:06:03.360> like<00:06:03.510> that<00:06:03.720> this

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
year of work and that's like that this

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:05.810 
year of work and that's like that this
isn't<00:06:04.320> he<00:06:04.409> did<00:06:04.590> three<00:06:05.010> seconds<00:06:05.520> you<00:06:05.639> through

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:05.820 
isn't he did three seconds you through

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.089 
isn't he did three seconds you through
it<00:06:05.909> together<00:06:06.030> this<00:06:06.360> is<00:06:06.539> completely<00:06:07.289> clear<00:06:07.680> but

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:08.099 
it together this is completely clear but

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:09.710 
it together this is completely clear but
that<00:06:08.220> doesn't<00:06:08.520> mean<00:06:08.639> that<00:06:08.669> it<00:06:09.000> has<00:06:09.030> properties

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 
that doesn't mean that it has properties

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.020 
that doesn't mean that it has properties
that<00:06:09.750> we<00:06:10.380> shouldn't<00:06:10.590> look<00:06:10.800> at<00:06:11.039> and<00:06:11.310> examine<00:06:11.520> as

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.030 
that we shouldn't look at and examine as

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.700 
that we shouldn't look at and examine as
we<00:06:12.180> make<00:06:12.389> move<00:06:12.720> forward<00:06:13.139> in<00:06:13.199> the<00:06:13.289> workshop

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:13.710 
we make move forward in the workshop

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.570 
we make move forward in the workshop
yeah<00:06:13.979> what<00:06:14.520> we<00:06:14.729> did<00:06:15.000> this<00:06:15.240> week<00:06:15.510> was<00:06:15.780> I

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:16.580 
yeah what we did this week was I

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:21.770 
yeah what we did this week was I
prepared<00:06:17.750> along<00:06:18.750> with<00:06:18.780> mark<00:06:19.560> every<00:06:20.460> morning<00:06:20.970> a

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 
prepared along with mark every morning a

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.740 
prepared along with mark every morning a
physical<00:06:22.650> workshop<00:06:23.360> leading<00:06:24.360> into<00:06:24.690> a

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750 
physical workshop leading into a

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.430 
physical workshop leading into a
conceptual<00:06:25.620> session<00:06:26.210> with<00:06:27.440> provocations

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 
conceptual session with provocations

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.820 
conceptual session with provocations
that<00:06:28.650> we<00:06:28.770> brought<00:06:28.979> to<00:06:29.220> the<00:06:29.340> group<00:06:30.830> discussing

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:31.830 
that we brought to the group discussing

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.520 
that we brought to the group discussing
ideas<00:06:32.180> we<00:06:33.180> we<00:06:33.479> threw<00:06:33.750> out<00:06:33.990> some<00:06:34.260> of<00:06:34.409> these

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:34.530 
ideas we we threw out some of these

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.750 
ideas we we threw out some of these
concepts<00:06:35.099> what<00:06:35.490> is<00:06:35.669> a<00:06:35.699> mixed<00:06:36.060> reality<00:06:36.380> what<00:06:37.380> is

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:37.760 
concepts what is a mixed reality what is

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.740 
concepts what is a mixed reality what is
an<00:06:38.760> image<00:06:39.270> filter<00:06:39.930> what<00:06:40.650> is<00:06:40.949> real<00:06:41.430> time<00:06:41.820> what

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:42.750 
an image filter what is real time what

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.100 
an image filter what is real time what
is<00:06:43.080> an<00:06:43.349> environment<00:06:44.070> and<00:06:44.720> out<00:06:45.720> of<00:06:45.990> these

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.110 
is an environment and out of these

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.219 
is an environment and out of these
conceptual<00:06:46.830> conceptual<00:06:47.699> sessions<00:06:48.180> in<00:06:48.870> the

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:49.229 
conceptual conceptual sessions in the

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:53.390 
conceptual conceptual sessions in the
afternoon<00:06:49.710> and<00:06:49.949> evenings<00:06:50.930> the<00:06:51.930> group<00:06:52.400> started

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:53.400 
afternoon and evenings the group started

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.190 
afternoon and evenings the group started
to

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:54.200 
to

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:59.700 
to
program<00:06:55.190> or<00:06:55.910> two<00:06:56.680> designs<00:06:57.680> are<00:06:58.190> so<00:06:58.940> I<00:06:58.970> think

00:06:59.700 --> 00:06:59.710 
program or two designs are so I think

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.190 
program or two designs are so I think
there<00:07:00.710> are<00:07:00.740> fewer<00:07:01.130> and<00:07:01.340> fewer<00:07:01.840> festivals<00:07:02.840> or

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:03.200 
there are fewer and fewer festivals or

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.230 
there are fewer and fewer festivals or
conferences<00:07:03.800> that<00:07:03.980> are<00:07:04.040> specifically<00:07:04.760> for

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:05.240 
conferences that are specifically for

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.970 
conferences that are specifically for
dance<00:07:05.570> and<00:07:05.750> technology<00:07:06.320> and<00:07:06.470> I<00:07:06.500> think<00:07:06.830> the

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:06.980 
dance and technology and I think the

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.130 
dance and technology and I think the
reason<00:07:07.160> for<00:07:07.520> that<00:07:07.550> is<00:07:07.940> that<00:07:08.180> the<00:07:08.810> work<00:07:08.960> really

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:09.140 
reason for that is that the work really

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.800 
reason for that is that the work really
is<00:07:09.230> getting<00:07:09.710> assimilated<00:07:10.490> and<00:07:10.880> that's<00:07:11.480> so

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:11.810 
is getting assimilated and that's so

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.200 
is getting assimilated and that's so
much<00:07:12.050> work<00:07:12.380> in<00:07:12.740> technology<00:07:13.310> of<00:07:13.820> some<00:07:14.030> kind

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:14.210 
much work in technology of some kind

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:18.340 
much work in technology of some kind
that<00:07:14.540> it<00:07:14.810> seems<00:07:15.140> silly<00:07:15.650> to<00:07:15.830> sequester<00:07:16.700> I<00:07:17.420> think

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:18.350 
that it seems silly to sequester I think
