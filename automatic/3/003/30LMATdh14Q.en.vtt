00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
I'm going to finish them and so these

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.060 
I'm going to finish them and so these
are<00:00:57.070> the<00:00:57.100> little<00:00:57.489> like<00:00:58.380> six<00:00:59.380> and<00:00:59.530> a<00:00:59.560> half<00:00:59.590> you

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
are the little like six and a half you

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.710 
are the little like six and a half you
know<00:01:00.190> it's<00:01:00.489> four<00:01:00.850> and<00:01:00.970> a<00:01:01.000> half<00:01:01.030> and<00:01:01.360> whatever

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
know it's four and a half and whatever

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.720 
know it's four and a half and whatever
and<00:01:02.050> I<00:01:02.230> think<00:01:02.470> in<00:01:02.829> between<00:01:03.160> r1<00:01:03.430> there's<00:01:03.670> a

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
and I think in between r1 there's a

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:04.829 
and I think in between r1 there's a
really<00:01:03.850> good<00:01:03.970> Wikipedia<00:01:04.449> page<00:01:04.570> that<00:01:04.720> tells

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
really good Wikipedia page that tells

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.480 
really good Wikipedia page that tells
you<00:01:04.989> all<00:01:05.110> about<00:01:05.140> them<00:01:05.439> and<00:01:05.620> you<00:01:05.680> can<00:01:06.340> actually

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
you all about them and you can actually

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:07.649 
you all about them and you can actually
lift<00:01:06.760> up<00:01:06.880> because<00:01:07.090> I<00:01:07.120> think<00:01:07.360> this<00:01:07.510> actually

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
lift up because I think this actually

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:09.570 
lift up because I think this actually
comes<00:01:07.990> as<00:01:08.229> one<00:01:08.409> of<00:01:08.470> them<00:01:08.650> all<00:01:09.040> right<00:01:09.250> Leslie
