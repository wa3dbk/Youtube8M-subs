00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 very interesting what line 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.830
 economic spent stalin yes that's for 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.580
 account of which he could so rapidly develop over 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.950
 short term 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.840
 industry he imitated money 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.150
 how much he needs or chose a loan 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.910
 back I constantly say that the economy is in 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.550
 what sense is it rational to explain everything in 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.119
 the economy 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:27.210
 method of rational knowledge method 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.400
 logic is not possible well some true 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.700
 They say here we say the German miracle 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.010
 Japanese miracle South Korean miracle there like 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.800
 since there are no miracles there 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.620
 harvested impromptu and green light 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.989
 there on the political line on the financial 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.399
 the line itself is just all very 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.410
 easy to explain 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.780
 Well, that is, here is not a new miracle when 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.329
 Germany after the second world and by the way 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.969
 before the second world she abruptly entered it 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.219
 what is it american money yes to second 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.840
 world war it even today even 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.809
 hesitate to call miracle because 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.530
 Today, everyone knows that German 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.830
 economy 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.470
 She has been brought up in the Anglo-Saxon 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.770
 capital but rather from equity capital 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.790
 from uk united states to 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.770
 mostly capital banks and so what 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.619
 of course what a miracle there was not just 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:24.090
 it was simply decided that 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:30.090
 need to strengthen germany actually 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:32.820
 redesigned carte blanche 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.200
 Paris Peace Treaty in particular 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.630
 let's say conditions 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.579
 the inadmissibility of the militarization of Germany 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.270
 in short germanium start 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.280
 evolve at a frantic pace 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.649
 it is natural that Germany was deployed 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.500
 east this here we started with stalin 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:53.159
 and as if here we go back to this 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.740
 topic and the German miracle after the war why 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:59.570
 German miracle after the war is also very 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.450
 understandable and understandable because of course 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:07.229
 World War II as a project 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:10.200
 Anglo-Saxon bankers he was executed 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.590
 not as the Soviet Union expected 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.160
 not so preserved 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.480
 strengthened its geopolitical position 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.180
 it is natural that England counted on 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:25.710
 dividends she no dividends 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:29.640
 got and actually lost many 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:32.850
 its colonies and influences in the British 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.040
 Empire America of course was perhaps 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.960
 the main beneficiary of the main 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.280
 beneficiary of this project 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.680
 The Second World War 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.710
 the Soviet Union developed very 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.540
 dynamic then naturally through 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.620
 some time they began to think and what about 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.610
 actually slow down the development 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.870
 geopolitical opponent in the face 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.550
 Soviet Union Warsaw Pact 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.040
 Council for Mutual Economic Assistance 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.490
 but they began to strengthen Germany as 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.490
 counterweight
