was<00:02:56.550> dictated<00:02:57.030> by<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.210> amount<00:02:57.540> of<00:02:57.630> money<00:02:57.870> I

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
was dictated by the amount of money I

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:10.190 
was dictated by the amount of money I
had<00:03:00.710> shortly<00:03:01.710> shot<00:03:02.810> in<00:03:03.810> this<00:03:05.480> idea<00:03:07.970> and<00:03:09.200> the

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
had shortly shot in this idea and the

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.949 
had shortly shot in this idea and the
clincher<00:03:12.440> I<00:03:13.820> think<00:03:14.820> it<00:03:14.910> was<00:03:15.090> absolutely

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
clincher I think it was absolutely

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.100 
clincher I think it was absolutely
professional<00:03:16.230> variety<00:03:16.890> but<00:03:17.959> sometimes<00:03:18.959> in

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
professional variety but sometimes in

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.480 
professional variety but sometimes in
your<00:03:19.140> naivete<00:03:19.709> without<00:03:19.980> exactly<00:03:20.310> knowing

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
your naivete without exactly knowing

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.300 
your naivete without exactly knowing
what<00:03:20.970> we're<00:03:21.540> doing<00:03:21.810> we<00:03:22.530> step<00:03:22.770> out<00:03:22.920> in<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.130> you

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
what we're doing we step out in the you

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.610 
what we're doing we step out in the you
stuff<00:03:23.640> and<00:03:24.270> then<00:03:24.450> it<00:03:24.600> works<00:03:24.840> of<00:03:25.220> all<00:03:26.220> these

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
stuff and then it works of all these

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.720 
stuff and then it works of all these
reasons<00:03:28.620> why<00:03:29.190> you<00:03:29.250> did<00:03:29.580> it

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
reasons why you did it

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.300 
reasons why you did it
are<00:03:30.300> you<00:03:30.510> believe<00:03:30.810> in<00:03:30.990> yourself<00:03:31.470> and<00:03:31.770> you<00:03:32.190> know

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
are you believe in yourself and you know

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.490 
are you believe in yourself and you know
respect<00:03:32.940> to<00:03:33.090> your<00:03:33.209> purpose<00:03:34.040> but<00:03:36.290> the<00:03:37.290> one

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
thing if I can take credit for this is

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.070 
thing if I can take credit for this is
madness<00:03:41.040> and<00:03:41.250> a<00:03:41.310> concern<00:03:41.750> what<00:03:42.750> that<00:03:42.930> was
