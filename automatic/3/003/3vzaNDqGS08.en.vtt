00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.779 
floor together so I drilled right
through<00:00:53.420> right<00:00:54.420> through<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.750> van<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.789> it

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
through right through the van and it

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.229 
through right through the van and it
holds<00:00:57.000> everything<00:00:57.300> tight<00:00:58.670> so<00:00:59.670> when<00:01:00.059> did<00:01:00.180> you

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
holds everything tight so when did you

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.939

come<00:01:00.690> in<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.899> back<00:01:01.620> end<00:01:02.870> see<00:01:03.870> here<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:04.769> is

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
come in the back end see here this is

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.929

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
hard time with the back because you have

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.499 
hard time with the back because you have
to<00:01:10.860> cut<00:01:11.100> every<00:01:11.340> piece<00:01:12.090> separately<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:14.509> it

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
was like like ten dollars for a lot of a

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.990 
was like like ten dollars for a lot of a
lot<00:02:33.360> of<00:02:33.510> sheets<00:02:33.750> of<00:02:33.959> mesh<00:02:34.500> but<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:35.370> sold<00:02:35.850> them

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
lot of sheets of mesh but I sold them

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.890 
lot of sheets of mesh but I sold them
together<00:02:37.340> and<00:02:38.340> three<00:02:38.760> later<00:02:39.000> is<00:02:39.239> because<00:02:39.660> the

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
together and three later is because the

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.449 
together and three later is because the
first<00:02:40.140> layer<00:02:40.350> I<00:02:40.440> probably<00:02:41.069> think<00:02:41.280> it<00:02:41.370> would

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
first layer I probably think it would

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.760 
first layer I probably think it would
rip<00:02:41.670> so<00:02:42.300> I<00:02:42.330> say<00:02:42.569> I<00:02:42.600> sold<00:02:43.050> them<00:02:43.140> together<00:02:43.470> three

rip so I say I sold them together three

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.490
