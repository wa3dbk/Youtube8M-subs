close it laser two essentially the same

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.180 
close it laser two essentially the same
thing<00:02:04.320> just<00:02:04.829> rename<00:02:05.219> it<00:02:06.110> add<00:02:07.190> keystroke

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
thing just rename it add keystroke

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.219 
thing just rename it add keystroke
sequence<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.940> alt

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
sequence of alt

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.550 
sequence of alt
to

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
to

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:21.830 
to
and<00:02:12.030> same<00:02:13.030> for<00:02:13.270> laser<00:02:13.480> three

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.559 

now<00:02:22.680> what<00:02:22.860> we're<00:02:23.010> gonna<00:02:23.099> do<00:02:23.370> for<00:02:23.700> laser<00:02:23.910> for<00:02:24.270> is

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
now what we're gonna do for laser for is

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.330 
now what we're gonna do for laser for is
we're<00:02:24.720> gonna<00:02:24.840> make<00:02:25.050> this<00:02:25.230> laser<00:02:25.500> control<00:02:26.099> the

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
we're gonna make this laser control the

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.690 
we're gonna make this laser control the
effects<00:02:26.880> on<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.270> off<00:02:27.390> for<00:02:28.200> Dec<00:02:28.410> a<00:02:28.680> so<00:02:29.580> what

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
effects on and off for Dec a so what

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.729 
effects on and off for Dec a so what
I'll<00:02:29.790> do<00:02:29.970> is<00:02:30.300> go<00:02:30.720> again<00:02:31.260> go<00:02:31.530> in<00:02:31.620> your

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
I'll do is go again go in your

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.420 
I'll do is go again go in your
configuration<00:02:32.360> look<00:02:33.360> at<00:02:33.480> your<00:02:33.599> mappers<00:02:34.080> and

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
configuration look at your mappers and

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.890 
configuration look at your mappers and
then<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:35.520> can<00:02:35.700> kind<00:02:35.910> of<00:02:35.970> see<00:02:36.180> where<00:02:36.630> your

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
then you can kind of see where your

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.309 
then you can kind of see where your
effects<00:02:37.290> on<00:02:37.560> and<00:02:37.830> off<00:02:37.950> are<00:02:38.630> as<00:02:39.630> you<00:02:39.900> can<00:02:40.080> see

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
effects on and off are as you can see

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.030 
effects on and off are as you can see
what<00:02:40.560> I've<00:02:40.769> done<00:02:40.800> is<00:02:41.430> created<00:02:42.290> my<00:02:43.290> own<00:02:43.319> key<00:02:44.010> and

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
what I've done is created my own key and

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.150 
what I've done is created my own key and
