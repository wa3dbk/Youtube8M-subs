action as it's being pulled behind the

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:04.830 
action as it's being pulled behind the
boat<00:01:03.249> okay<00:01:03.969> and<00:01:04.090> then<00:01:04.180> the<00:01:04.270> second<00:01:04.600> thing<00:01:04.720> you

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:04.840 
boat okay and then the second thing you

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.480 
boat okay and then the second thing you
want<00:01:04.870> to<00:01:05.110> do<00:01:05.230> is<00:01:05.740> you<00:01:05.860> need<00:01:05.950> to<00:01:06.070> remove<00:01:06.310> the

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
want to do is you need to remove the

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.400 
want to do is you need to remove the
entrails<00:01:06.850> from<00:01:07.060> the<00:01:07.300> bait<00:01:07.480> and<00:01:07.660> the<00:01:08.050> reason

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.410 
entrails from the bait and the reason

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.650 
entrails from the bait and the reason
for<00:01:08.560> this<00:01:08.710> is<00:01:08.770> the<00:01:09.520> entrails<00:01:09.910> inside<00:01:10.390> actually

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
for this is the entrails inside actually

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.690 
for this is the entrails inside actually
have<00:01:11.050> enzymes<00:01:11.260> that<00:01:11.830> are<00:01:11.890> going<00:01:12.190> to<00:01:12.370> eat<00:01:12.550> away

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
have enzymes that are going to eat away

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.420 
have enzymes that are going to eat away
at<00:01:12.850> the<00:01:13.000> bait<00:01:13.270> from<00:01:13.540> the<00:01:13.660> inside<00:01:14.020> out

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
at the bait from the inside out

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.260 
at the bait from the inside out
consequently<00:01:15.430> your<00:01:15.670> baits<00:01:15.850> going<00:01:16.060> to<00:01:16.120> wash

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
consequently your baits going to wash

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.630 
consequently your baits going to wash
out<00:01:16.510> faster<00:01:16.990> than<00:01:17.140> it<00:01:17.260> normally<00:01:17.380> would<00:01:17.680> so<00:01:18.520> now

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
out faster than it normally would so now

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.430 
out faster than it normally would so now
you're<00:01:18.790> ready<00:01:18.820> to<00:01:19.030> start<00:01:19.330> rigging<00:01:19.690> you're
