remember<00:00:06.390> how<00:00:06.509> I<00:00:06.540> told<00:00:06.689> you<00:00:06.990> about<00:00:07.259> the<00:00:07.439> deck

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
remember how I told you about the deck

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.160 
remember how I told you about the deck
that<00:00:08.129> travels<00:00:08.460> in<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:08.670> case<00:00:08.879> well<00:00:09.450> you<00:00:10.019> can

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
that travels in the case well you can

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.420 
that travels in the case well you can
take<00:00:10.320> it<00:00:10.440> out<00:00:10.559> of<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.740> case<00:00:10.920> and<00:00:10.980> it's<00:00:11.309> a<00:00:11.400> very

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:11.430 
take it out of the case and it's a very

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.610 
take it out of the case and it's a very
good<00:00:11.639> way<00:00:11.879> of<00:00:11.910> demonstrating<00:00:12.299> just<00:00:12.870> how<00:00:13.379> the

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
good way of demonstrating just how the

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.450 
good way of demonstrating just how the
Geary<00:00:14.160> light<00:00:14.629> mounting<00:00:15.629> system<00:00:16.080> works<00:00:16.320> it's<00:00:17.160> a

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
Geary light mounting system works it's a

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.560 
Geary light mounting system works it's a
ball<00:00:18.090> mount<00:00:18.950> and<00:00:19.950> as<00:00:20.820> you<00:00:20.939> can<00:00:21.119> see<00:00:21.150> you<00:00:21.359> can

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
ball mount and as you can see you can

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.290 
ball mount and as you can see you can
position<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.500> light<00:00:22.740> anywhere<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.849> lock<00:00:24.150> it

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
position the light anywhere and lock it

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.300 
position the light anywhere and lock it
off<00:00:24.449> in<00:00:24.660> any<00:00:24.840> position<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:25.830> stays<00:00:26.070> there

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
off in any position and it stays there

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.390 
off in any position and it stays there
and<00:00:26.689> this<00:00:27.689> is<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.929> universal<00:00:28.619> way<00:00:28.800> that<00:00:29.160> Giri

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
and this is the universal way that Giri

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.890 
and this is the universal way that Giri
lights<00:00:29.670> are<00:00:29.849> mounted<00:00:30.179> throughout<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.689> system

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
lights are mounted throughout the system

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.390 
lights are mounted throughout the system
and<00:00:31.140> I'll<00:00:31.289> show<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.500> more<00:00:31.769> applications

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:32.400 
and I'll show you more applications

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.869 
and I'll show you more applications
later<00:00:33.140> now<00:00:34.140> this<00:00:34.260> giri<00:00:34.589> light<00:00:34.830> happens<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.790> be

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:35.879 
later now this giri light happens to be

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:39.979 
later now this giri light happens to be
fitted<00:00:36.180> with<00:00:36.589> an<00:00:37.589> egg<00:00:37.769> crate<00:00:38.570> which<00:00:39.570> goes<00:00:39.809> on

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
fitted with an egg crate which goes on

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.369 
fitted with an egg crate which goes on
with<00:00:40.110> Velcro<00:00:41.479> of<00:00:42.479> course<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.809> barn<00:00:42.989> doors<00:00:43.229> are

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
with Velcro of course the barn doors are

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.060 
with Velcro of course the barn doors are
closed<00:00:43.589> so<00:00:44.010> if<00:00:44.940> we<00:00:45.210> open<00:00:45.330> them<00:00:45.570> up<00:00:45.720> you<00:00:46.680> see<00:00:46.890> how

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
closed so if we open them up you see how

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.619 
closed so if we open them up you see how
it<00:00:47.190> goes<00:00:47.600> under<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.750> light<00:00:49.019> and<00:00:49.260> thereby

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
it goes under the light and thereby

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:57.759 
it goes under the light and thereby
narrowing<00:00:51.629> down<00:00:51.659> the<00:00:51.900> spill<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.040> light

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:00.890 

now<00:00:58.769> when<00:00:59.100> you've<00:00:59.250> got<00:00:59.369> your<00:00:59.430> lights<00:00:59.900> mounted

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
now when you've got your lights mounted

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.100 
now when you've got your lights mounted
on<00:01:01.290> the<00:01:01.790> deck<00:01:02.790> you<00:01:03.180> can<00:01:03.210> see<00:01:03.540> how<00:01:03.720> the<00:01:03.780> deck

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
on the deck you can see how the deck

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.039 
on the deck you can see how the deck
becomes<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:05.129> stand<00:01:05.820> in<00:01:06.030> itself<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.689> can<00:01:06.900> be<00:01:07.020> a

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
becomes a stand in itself it can be a

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.649 
becomes a stand in itself it can be a
floor<00:01:07.500> stand<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.670> can<00:01:08.700> prop<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.119> against<00:01:09.450> the

of them first of all you'll notice that

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.510 
of them first of all you'll notice that
it<00:04:50.270> has<00:04:50.300> an<00:04:50.599> angled<00:04:51.260> top<00:04:51.530> we<00:04:51.860> had<00:04:52.039> it<00:04:52.160> mounted

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
it has an angled top we had it mounted

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.640 
it has an angled top we had it mounted
on<00:04:52.849> us<00:04:52.970> in<00:04:53.180> the<00:04:53.300> stand<00:04:53.539> like<00:04:53.750> that<00:04:53.990> but<00:04:54.470> if<00:04:54.560> you

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
on us in the stand like that but if you

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.320 
on us in the stand like that but if you
would<00:04:54.770> amount<00:04:55.010> it<00:04:55.220> this<00:04:55.550> way<00:04:55.760> around<00:04:56.060> in<00:04:56.240> the

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
would amount it this way around in the

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.089 
would amount it this way around in the
stand<00:04:56.630> it<00:04:57.139> means<00:04:57.320> that<00:04:57.440> it<00:04:57.530> would<00:04:57.650> be<00:04:57.740> leaning

00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:58.099 
stand it means that it would be leaning

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:00.610 
stand it means that it would be leaning
forward<00:04:58.580> and<00:04:58.729> then<00:04:59.120> each<00:04:59.389> of<00:04:59.840> the<00:04:59.990> four<00:05:00.289> lights

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
forward and then each of the four lights

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.029 
forward and then each of the four lights
could<00:05:01.220> then<00:05:01.370> be<00:05:01.520> angled<00:05:02.470> vertically<00:05:03.470> so<00:05:03.919> it

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039 
could then be angled vertically so it

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:06.129 
could then be angled vertically so it
really<00:05:04.280> is<00:05:04.370> a<00:05:04.490> true<00:05:04.880> top<00:05:05.300> light<00:05:05.570> which<00:05:05.870> comes

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:06.139 
really is a true top light which comes
