think of it and maybe I can improve on
it<00:02:47.280> or<00:02:47.570> come<00:02:48.570> something<00:02:48.870> cool<00:02:49.050> i<00:02:49.140> can<00:02:49.320> add<00:02:49.470> cook

it up to some hardened clay maybe for

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.480 
it up to some hardened clay maybe for
the<00:02:54.120> floor<00:02:55.080> or<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.010> roof<00:02:56.310> or<00:02:56.460> something

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
here's the interior I don't really like

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.560 
here's the interior I don't really like
it<00:02:59.570> don't<00:03:00.570> like<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.900> outside<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:02.160> cobble<00:03:02.670> you

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
it don't like the outside the cobble you

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
it don't like the outside the cobble you
know<00:03:03.690> their<00:03:04.050> villagers<00:03:04.530> but<00:03:05.360> seems<00:03:06.360> like

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
know their villagers but seems like

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.610 
know their villagers but seems like
these<00:03:07.590> houses<00:03:08.100> look<00:03:08.130> just<00:03:08.610> so<00:03:08.910> boring<00:03:09.260> so<00:03:10.260> I

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
these houses look just so boring so I

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.730 
these houses look just so boring so I
will<00:03:11.130> I<00:03:12.050> will<00:03:13.050> stand<00:03:13.950> in<00:03:14.340> a<00:03:14.700> spot<00:03:15.150> here<00:03:15.620> do<00:03:16.620> it

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
will I will stand in a spot here do it

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.020 
will I will stand in a spot here do it
before<00:03:17.000> do<00:03:18.000> a<00:03:18.060> spin<00:03:18.450> and<00:03:18.690> do<00:03:18.989> it<00:03:19.110> after<00:03:19.500> and

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
before do a spin and do it after and

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:27.880 
before do a spin and do it after and
tell<00:03:21.030> me<00:03:21.150> what<00:03:21.239> you<00:03:21.270> think<00:03:23.300> before<00:03:25.100> movie<00:03:26.450> hero

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
tell me what you think before movie hero

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.340 
tell me what you think before movie hero
and<00:03:28.890> there<00:03:29.610> it<00:03:29.790> is<00:03:30.000> there<00:03:30.780> is<00:03:31.020> the<00:03:31.320> new<00:03:31.620> house

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
and there it is there is the new house

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.720 
and there it is there is the new house
it's<00:03:34.350> kind<00:03:34.560> of<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:34.739> idea<00:03:34.770> that<00:03:35.160> I'm<00:03:35.459> going<00:03:35.610> for

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
it's kind of the idea that I'm going for

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.430 
it's kind of the idea that I'm going for
the<00:03:35.940> interior<00:03:36.750> is<00:03:36.890> not<00:03:37.890> finished<00:03:38.370> but<00:03:39.440> this

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
the interior is not finished but this

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.940 
the interior is not finished but this
took<00:03:40.680> longer<00:03:40.739> than<00:03:41.459> I<00:03:41.820> anticipated<00:03:42.620> but<00:03:43.620> I

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
took longer than I anticipated but I

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.390 
took longer than I anticipated but I
think<00:03:44.730> it<00:03:44.820> looks<00:03:44.850> a<00:03:45.150> lot<00:03:45.480> better<00:03:46.130> than<00:03:47.130> one<00:03:47.310> of

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
think it looks a lot better than one of

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.180 
think it looks a lot better than one of
those<00:03:47.489> houses<00:03:48.290> don't<00:03:49.290> looking<00:03:49.590> for<00:03:49.830> kind<00:03:50.040> of

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
those houses don't looking for kind of

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.940 
those houses don't looking for kind of
like<00:03:50.310> a<00:03:51.380> square<00:03:52.380> /<00:03:52.940> futuristic<00:03:53.940> kind<00:03:54.239> of<00:03:54.950> kind

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
like a square / futuristic kind of kind

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.890 
like a square / futuristic kind of kind
of<00:03:56.130> feel<00:03:56.310> to<00:03:56.340> it<00:03:56.550> with<00:03:56.910> a<00:03:57.180> little<00:03:57.540> bit<00:03:57.720> of<00:03:57.780> the

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
of feel to it with a little bit of the

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.620 
of feel to it with a little bit of the
old<00:03:57.930> designs<00:03:58.530> with<00:03:59.310> new<00:04:00.180> writings<00:04:00.709> so<00:04:02.630> that's

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
old designs with new writings so that's

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.920 
old designs with new writings so that's
what<00:04:03.720> I'm<00:04:03.810> hoping<00:04:03.959> on<00:04:04.320> doing<00:04:04.770> for<00:04:05.840> most<00:04:06.840> of

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
what I'm hoping on doing for most of

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:13.509 
what I'm hoping on doing for most of
these<00:04:07.050> houses<00:04:07.520> hopefully<00:04:08.520> I<00:04:11.209> can<00:04:12.209> do<00:04:12.510> them<00:04:12.690> I

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
these houses hopefully I can do them I

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.740 
these houses hopefully I can do them I
will<00:04:14.519> do<00:04:14.670> them<00:04:14.850> off<00:04:15.030> screen<00:04:15.390> though<00:04:15.540> because

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
will do them off screen though because

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.500 
will do them off screen though because
that<00:04:16.590> took<00:04:16.859> a<00:04:16.980> long<00:04:17.280> time<00:04:17.340> and<00:04:18.000> until<00:04:18.359> you

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
that took a long time and until you

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.690 
that took a long time and until you
upgrade<00:04:18.870> sleep<00:04:19.200> this<00:04:20.160> actually<00:04:20.340> took

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
upgrade sleep this actually took

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.690 
upgrade sleep this actually took
probably<00:04:21.209> about<00:04:22.070> pulling<00:04:23.070> on<00:04:23.160> an<00:04:23.250> hour<00:04:23.400> and<00:04:23.669> a

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
probably about pulling on an hour and a

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.390 
probably about pulling on an hour and a
half<00:04:23.850> in<00:04:24.360> between<00:04:24.720> recording<00:04:25.760> so

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
half in between recording so

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.790 
half in between recording so
I<00:04:27.460> might<00:04:28.210> make<00:04:28.330> an<00:04:28.479> easier<00:04:28.840> design<00:04:29.139> maybe<00:04:29.650> if

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
I might make an easier design maybe if

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.550 
I might make an easier design maybe if
you<00:04:29.889> guys<00:04:30.009> can<00:04:30.630> send<00:04:31.630> me<00:04:31.720> a<00:04:31.750> cool<00:04:32.020> design<00:04:32.169> that

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
you guys can send me a cool design that

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.210 
you guys can send me a cool design that
I<00:04:32.620> could<00:04:32.770> use<00:04:32.919> for<00:04:33.130> some<00:04:33.280> houses<00:04:33.669> and<00:04:34.949> I<00:04:35.949> will

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220

I could use for some houses and I will
try<00:04:36.400> to<00:04:36.490> use<00:04:36.820> them<00:04:38.190> um<00:04:40.259> yeah<00:04:41.259> well<00:04:41.530> I'm<00:04:41.830> on

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:46.370 
try to use them um yeah well I'm on
seven<00:04:42.190> food<00:04:42.490> I<00:04:43.229> will<00:04:44.229> I<00:04:44.680> will<00:04:44.919> make<00:04:45.220> my<00:04:45.550> base

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
seven food I will I will make my base

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.140 
seven food I will I will make my base
eventually<00:04:47.380> my<00:04:48.130> guy<00:04:48.310> i<00:04:48.340> might<00:04:48.669> started<00:04:49.030> off

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
eventually my guy i might started off

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.939 
eventually my guy i might started off
camera<00:04:49.419> maybe<00:04:49.810> record<00:04:50.259> something<00:04:50.530> good<00:04:50.740> for

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:50.949 
camera maybe record something good for

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:56.249 
camera maybe record something good for
the<00:04:51.009> next<00:04:51.220> episode<00:04:51.370> and<00:04:54.419> hopefully<00:04:55.419> and<00:04:56.229> i

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:56.259 
the next episode and hopefully and i

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:01.129 
the next episode and hopefully and i
keep<00:04:56.470> saying<00:04:56.650> hopefully<00:04:57.090> but<00:04:58.830> yeah<00:04:59.830> I<00:05:00.130> will

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 
keep saying hopefully but yeah I will

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
make this place into a little farm area

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.189 
make this place into a little farm area
the<00:05:06.130> villagers<00:05:06.580> would<00:05:06.820> be<00:05:06.970> controlled<00:05:07.810> by<00:05:07.960> me

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:08.199 
the villagers would be controlled by me

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:12.000 
the villagers would be controlled by me
