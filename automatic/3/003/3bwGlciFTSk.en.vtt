before I've gotten it on YouTube before
just<00:01:52.509> because<00:01:52.539> I<00:01:52.990> have<00:01:53.259> planned<00:01:53.799> to<00:01:54.069> get<00:01:54.189> pets

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:58.980 
in the past and then the plan just never
followed<00:01:57.520> through<00:01:57.880> because<00:01:58.420> of<00:01:58.689> new<00:01:58.959> things

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
followed through because of new things

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.740 
followed through because of new things
coming<00:01:59.560> up<00:01:59.770> and<00:02:00.130> whatnot<00:02:00.399> so<00:02:00.610> I<00:02:01.119> didn't<00:02:01.539> want

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
coming up and whatnot so I didn't want

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.090
