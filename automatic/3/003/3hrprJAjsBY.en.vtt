having<00:00:55.050> laptops<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:56.100> record<00:00:56.430> box<00:00:56.640> everything

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
having laptops the record box everything

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.380 
having laptops the record box everything
combined<00:00:57.479> into<00:00:57.809> one<00:00:57.839> is<00:00:58.369> marvelous<00:00:59.390> the

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
combined into one is marvelous the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.660 
combined into one is marvelous the
possibilities<00:01:01.110> of<00:01:01.140> using<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.070> effects<00:01:02.519> with

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
possibilities of using the effects with

the way of DJing in the future now you

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.300 
the way of DJing in the future now you
really<00:01:15.750> get<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.140> one-on-one<00:01:16.470> approaching
