00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hello in this video I show you how 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.529
 prepare a moisturizer at home 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.240
 for the face to the rose in fact two three 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.200
 days ago published on instagram 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.000
 twitter facebook the water photo of 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.640
 hydro roses the pink app that I was 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.180
 arrived from the novel nanÃ¬ was just 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.720
 just arrived and meanwhile in short 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.490
 you told me he liked it 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.490
 see a tutorial on how to make it 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.470
 a rose face cream then there 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.219
 I immediately put it because it had anyway 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.770
 a need to prepare in this cream 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:40.260
 and so here it is I decided precisely of 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.280
 immediately record the video to upload it 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.770
 I'm sorry because I didn't upload many 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.170
 video of this period because how 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.739
 you will probably be on the GDP not that 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.899
 now I am very cold indeed 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.350
 all a bit of influence and I am 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.690
 taking up slowly and then in short 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.480
 today I still feel a little better 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.820
 compared to the other days I already have 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.060
 anyway started working again 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.790
 in short, I am at full capacity 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:16.229
 but in reality they are not yet in shape 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.150
 at 100 percent, however, I am here 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.549
 I really wanted to do this to you 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.939
 tutorial because the face cream that 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.680
 I prepared I like it was there years 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.659
 according to me the cream that is good in 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.549
 spring and summer 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.860
 I made this cream 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:36.880
 for those with normal skin that tends 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:40.100
 to be mixed normal view then 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:45.229

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:48.440
 quantity of oils and butters to be changed into 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.770
 based on your skin type so if 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.149

 see you in the next video 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.030
 Hello 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.910
 first I go to put in a 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.160
 small pot the hydro side of roses or water of 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.010
 roses that you can replace with water 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.350
 distilled or another hydro side 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.020
 to this I add the shea butter which 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.000
 goes to nourish by softening the skin and 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.340
 I chose the oil of apricot oil 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.050
 but you can replace it with another oil 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.810
 among those I indicated at the beginning 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.210
 of the tutorial finally add the oliver 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.580
 thousand which is the auto mission ante of 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.070
 this product I put it all to 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.260
 bain-marie for a few minutes to make 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.870
 melt the shea butter and the olive 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.130
 and miller 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.140
 remember to mix from time to time 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.060
 to make the ingredients that you 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.510
 they have to melt they melt more 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.510
 quickly 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.400
 as you can see now it has melted 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.620
 all 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.440
 I'm going to remove the bath pot 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.180
 maria io for convenience should be transferred 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.530
 all the compound in another 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:47.110
 container however you can safely 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:50.080
 use the previous one what 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:54.360
 you put in a bain-marie i go to 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.360
 blend with the blender for two minutes 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.500
 then I go to put it all in a bathroom 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:05.019
 maria cold then a container like 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.940
 this with cold water and 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.370
 I transfer the container to this one 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:13.620
 cold bain-marie and continue to blend 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.620
 with the blender for another two minutes 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.950
 stop whipping when in fact 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.660
 we will get a compound like this dense 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.669
 and creamy 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.160
 we could say that our cream is already 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:28.200
 ready now we can go to 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.200
 add all the other ingredients 

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:39.439
 I add the vitamin and tocopherol that it has 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:41.300
 moisturizing and anti-aging properties if there is none 

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:42.949
 you have it you can avoid putting it 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:47.889
 or you can replace it with the 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:47.889
 provitamin b5 or with allantoin 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.960
 then I add the essential rose oil 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.300
 or of lavender if you have you can 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.430
 use another natural fragrance 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.010
 or the essential oil you use 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.530
 usually when you prepare the cream 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.480
 for the face 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.820
 finally I add the preservative cons card 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.610
 which will allow us to keep the 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.820
 produced up to 5 6 months at temperature 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.820
 environment 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:25.970
 the last step is very important is 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.590
 this then measure the ph with the 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.460
 litmus paper found in 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:37.430
 pharmacy that must be between 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:39.980
 4.5 and 5.5 I then transfer everything to the 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:42.260
 final container is the one here is the 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:44.540
 our rose face cream is 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.250
 ready to be used 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.260
 I very much hope that this tutorial there 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.190
 both liked and that you will like this 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.710
