00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.660
 you will understand you keep silence and never 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.700
 you fall apart you will always come afloat 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.979
 even if you see that it sinks you if you feel 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.350
 observed and you're the point of view with 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.570
 eyes closed like air and breathe 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.550
 they will disappear if they were those 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.550
 nightmares that made you tremble already 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.890
 nothing will bother you the time will pass and we 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.380
 will put in its place and if this one does not 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.229
 you do not have to worry, you always knew 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.970
 what you should do you never heard 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.800
 even if you were not going to beat 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.110
 it's not just heroes who win the 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.360
 battle and with airs of greatness they return 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.310
 as the one who does not fail heroes are those 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.260
 that they did not mind dying for battle 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.260
 allow his companions to continue 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.880
 Y 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.880
 if not 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.849
 When time passes and you look to the past 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:22.370
 there you will find out if it is really 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:24.349
 triumphed you will not always get the prize 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.510
 what will you want sometimes you have to conform 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.790
 with what others want to give you the world 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.769
 it's unfair, it may be, but in 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.519
 change the millionaire I do not think what 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.980
 you create 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.900
 I know that sometimes you would want to escape from 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.569
 escape from depressions take air and 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.790
 rest you look around you and all 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.980
 They are happy but you feel the pain of 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.930
 wounds without scars can not smile 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.150
 it would be impossible 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.579
 leaving no one living would be sad 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.010
 Love withered your smiles 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:54.709
 existed and the success of life never 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.590
 granted you now only one step everything 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:00.200
 will change in a tall building do not know if 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.909
 jump thousands of memories flood your 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.030
 thought now you agree 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:07.970
 you will kill the suffering you jump

 Vacuum jump in just a few seconds no 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.079
 there will be heat or cold there will be no laughter 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:14.599
 there will be love neither tears nor pain will not be 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:16.579
 nothing more than a cozy silence but 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.470
