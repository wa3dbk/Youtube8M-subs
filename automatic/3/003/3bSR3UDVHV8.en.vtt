00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:44.959 
before you go ahead let's cover all the
things<00:01:44.069> you<00:01:44.189> just<00:01:44.219> put<00:01:44.520> in<00:01:44.549> there<00:01:44.729> there<00:01:44.850> was<00:01:44.880> a

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:44.969 
things you just put in there there was a

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:46.969 
things you just put in there there was a
sort<00:01:45.179> of<00:01:45.210> teaspoon<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.689> salt<00:01:45.959> mm-hm<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:46.829> some

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
sort of teaspoon of salt mm-hm so some

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.440 
sort of teaspoon of salt mm-hm so some
other<00:01:47.100> little<00:01:47.280> powdery<00:01:47.819> thing<00:01:48.060> research

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
other little powdery thing research

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.639 
other little powdery thing research
which<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.780> what<00:01:48.899> i<00:01:48.929> said<00:01:49.109> you<00:01:49.200> can<00:01:49.229> leave<00:01:49.499> a

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
which is what i said you can leave a

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.620 
which is what i said you can leave a
diffusal<00:01:50.159> yo<00:01:50.369> right<00:01:50.819> right<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.539> but

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
diffusal yo right right and but

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.870 
diffusal yo right right and but
otherwise<00:01:51.869> you'll<00:01:52.170> get<00:01:52.319> a<00:01:52.350> little<00:01:52.619> drew

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
otherwise you'll get a little drew

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.129 
otherwise you'll get a little drew
watering<00:01:53.880> out<00:01:53.999> if<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.209> don't<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.689> then

00:01:55.129 --> 00:01:55.139 
watering out if you don't and then

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:56.989 
watering out if you don't and then
because<00:01:55.499> we<00:01:55.950> have<00:01:56.069> so<00:01:56.249> much<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.429> the<00:01:56.759> sour

00:01:56.989 --> 00:01:56.999 
because we have so much of the sour

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:58.730 
because we have so much of the sour
cream<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.600> that's<00:01:57.869> what<00:01:58.079> gives<00:01:58.229> that<00:01:58.469> lilting

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
cream and that's what gives that lilting

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.859 
cream and that's what gives that lilting
addictive<00:01:59.729> oh<00:01:59.850> that's<00:02:00.149> why<00:02:00.299> we're<00:02:00.479> using<00:02:00.630> it

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
addictive oh that's why we're using it

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.410 
addictive oh that's why we're using it
because<00:02:00.990> we<00:02:01.409> have<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:01.770> much<00:02:01.889> of<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.189> no<00:02:02.549> we

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
because we have so much of it no we

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.160 
because we have so much of it no we
haven't<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:05.149> so<00:02:06.149> much<00:02:06.329> sour<00:02:06.539> cream<00:02:06.810> let's<00:02:06.990> put

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
haven't you so much sour cream let's put

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.840 
haven't you so much sour cream let's put
it<00:02:07.259> in<00:02:07.380> because<00:02:07.709> we<00:02:07.920> have<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:08.130> much<00:02:08.250> sour<00:02:08.490> cream

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
it in because we have so much sour cream

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.279 
it in because we have so much sour cream
we<00:02:09.479> have<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.810> use<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:09.959> little<00:02:10.080> bit<00:02:10.200> of

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
we have to use a little bit of

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.610 
we have to use a little bit of
cornstarch<00:02:10.619> on<00:02:11.159> to<00:02:11.970> use<00:02:12.120> all<00:02:12.390> yolks<00:02:12.750> so<00:02:13.019> that

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
cornstarch on to use all yolks so that

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.500 
cornstarch on to use all yolks so that
it<00:02:13.860> thickens<00:02:14.340> it<00:02:14.430> because<00:02:14.730> sour<00:02:14.939> cream<00:02:15.180> a<00:02:15.330> look

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
it thickens it because sour cream a look

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
it thickens it because sour cream a look
thick<00:02:15.780> now<00:02:16.019> but

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
thick now but

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.590 
thick now but
actually<00:02:16.860> it's<00:02:17.010> just<00:02:17.220> as<00:02:17.370> thin<00:02:17.670> as<00:02:17.910> if<00:02:18.390> you<00:02:18.510> use

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
actually it's just as thin as if you use

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.690 
actually it's just as thin as if you use
heavy<00:02:18.870> cream<00:02:18.959> when<00:02:19.350> you<00:02:19.440> bake<00:02:19.700> interesting

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
heavy cream when you bake interesting

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.520 
heavy cream when you bake interesting
because<00:02:20.940> it<00:02:21.330> sort<00:02:21.630> of<00:02:21.690> melts<00:02:21.990> it<00:02:22.110> liquefies

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
because it sort of melts it liquefies

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.530 
because it sort of melts it liquefies
exactly<00:02:23.280> it<00:02:23.459> just<00:02:23.640> looks<00:02:23.940> like<00:02:24.150> it's<00:02:24.330> thicker

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
exactly it just looks like it's thicker

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.150 
exactly it just looks like it's thicker
but<00:02:24.900> actually<00:02:25.200> is<00:02:25.319> the<00:02:25.410> same<00:02:25.590> moisture

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
but actually is the same moisture

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.210 
but actually is the same moisture
content<00:02:26.610> she<00:02:27.240> knows<00:02:27.390> so<00:02:27.630> much<00:02:27.810> I'm<00:02:28.440> I'm<00:02:28.830> in<00:02:29.040> awe

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
content she knows so much I'm I'm in awe

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.530 
content she knows so much I'm I'm in awe
this<00:02:29.490> is<00:02:29.580> what<00:02:29.730> I<00:02:29.760> look<00:02:29.940> like<00:02:29.970> when<00:02:30.180> I'm<00:02:30.240> in<00:02:30.450> on

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
this is what I look like when I'm in on

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.480 
this is what I look like when I'm in on
okay<00:02:30.840> go<00:02:31.020> ahead<00:02:31.080> so<00:02:31.560> that's<00:02:31.830> three<00:02:32.069> cups<00:02:32.310> of

you're<00:07:05.110> glazing<00:07:05.530> up<00:07:05.650> see<00:07:05.979> this<00:07:06.130> is<00:07:06.340> puddling

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:07.060 
you're glazing up see this is puddling

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.510 
you're glazing up see this is puddling
normally<00:07:07.930> I<00:07:07.960> fill<00:07:08.380> the<00:07:08.530> entire<00:07:08.650> top<00:07:09.130> with<00:07:09.370> it

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:09.520

normally I fill the entire top with it
but<00:07:09.669> I<00:07:09.729> think<00:07:09.910> it<00:07:10.000> looks<00:07:10.150> really<00:07:10.210> pretty<00:07:10.510> like

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:10.750 
but I think it looks really pretty like

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:13.350 
but I think it looks really pretty like
this<00:07:10.930> too<00:07:11.199> I<00:07:11.550> would<00:07:12.550> I<00:07:12.699> would<00:07:12.820> boil<00:07:13.150> this<00:07:13.180> down

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:13.360 
this too I would I would boil this down

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.210 
this too I would I would boil this down
a<00:07:13.570> little<00:07:13.720> bit<00:07:14.020> thicker<00:07:14.260> see<00:07:14.560> it's<00:07:14.889> a<00:07:15.040> little

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:15.220 
a little bit thicker see it's a little

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.070 
a little bit thicker see it's a little
bit<00:07:15.340> watery<00:07:15.639> but<00:07:16.090> it's<00:07:16.300> okay<00:07:16.600> because<00:07:16.630> it<00:07:16.990> will

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:17.080 
bit watery but it's okay because it will

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.840 
bit watery but it's okay because it will
give<00:07:17.110> it<00:07:17.320> a<00:07:17.380> shine<00:07:17.620> and<00:07:17.950> make<00:07:18.160> it<00:07:18.310> look<00:07:18.669> at
