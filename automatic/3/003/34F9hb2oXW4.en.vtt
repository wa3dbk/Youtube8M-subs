again<00:00:06.550> with<00:00:06.700> another<00:00:06.730> flashlight<00:00:07.540> review

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:08.080 
again with another flashlight review

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.320 
again with another flashlight review
today<00:00:08.680> we're<00:00:08.770> gonna<00:00:08.860> be<00:00:09.129> kind<00:00:10.059> of<00:00:10.120> doing<00:00:10.299> a

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:10.330 
today we're gonna be kind of doing a

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:11.520 
today we're gonna be kind of doing a
little<00:00:10.420> comparison<00:00:11.080> between<00:00:11.230> the

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:11.530 
little comparison between the

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.340 
little comparison between the
Streamlight<00:00:11.980> SL<00:00:13.020> 20x<00:00:14.020> with<00:00:15.010> the<00:00:15.250> terra<00:00:15.730> lux

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
Streamlight SL 20x with the terra lux

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.740 
Streamlight SL 20x with the terra lux
upgrade<00:00:17.350> LED<00:00:17.859> bulb<00:00:18.100> and<00:00:18.550> we're<00:00:19.449> gonna<00:00:19.570> be

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:19.750 
upgrade LED bulb and we're gonna be

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.320 
upgrade LED bulb and we're gonna be
comparing<00:00:20.140> it<00:00:20.230> to<00:00:20.289> the<00:00:20.619> 511<00:00:21.580> light<00:00:21.910> for<00:00:22.150> life

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.330 
comparing it to the 511 light for life

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.120 
comparing it to the 511 light for life
the<00:00:22.630> three-point<00:00:23.519> 400<00:00:24.519> the<00:00:25.029> bigger<00:00:25.240> light<00:00:26.130> the

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
the three-point 400 the bigger light the

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.769 
the three-point 400 the bigger light the
main<00:00:27.279> differences<00:00:27.759> in<00:00:27.939> the<00:00:28.060> two<00:00:28.240> just<00:00:28.659> to

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:28.779 
main differences in the two just to

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:34.460 
main differences in the two just to
start<00:00:29.050> with<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:31.599> light<00:00:32.259> for<00:00:32.470> life<00:00:32.650> has<00:00:32.950> got

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
start with the light for life has got

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.360 
start with the light for life has got
ultracapacitors<00:00:35.470> in<00:00:35.650> it<00:00:35.770> which<00:00:35.950> makes<00:00:36.130> it<00:00:36.280> a

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
ultracapacitors in it which makes it a

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.370 
ultracapacitors in it which makes it a
lot<00:00:36.520> lighter<00:00:36.790> it's<00:00:37.600> a<00:00:37.690> really<00:00:37.960> light<00:00:38.140> light

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:38.380 
lot lighter it's a really light light

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.170 
lot lighter it's a really light light
there's<00:00:38.650> not<00:00:38.800> a<00:00:38.860> lot<00:00:39.010> of<00:00:39.040> weight<00:00:39.250> to<00:00:39.460> it<00:00:39.490> a

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
there's not a lot of weight to it a

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.860 
there's not a lot of weight to it a
little<00:00:40.570> bit<00:00:40.720> shorter<00:00:41.710> runtime<00:00:42.370> on<00:00:42.640> the<00:00:43.570> bright

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
little bit shorter runtime on the bright

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.110 
little bit shorter runtime on the bright
mode<00:00:44.110> which<00:00:44.350> is<00:00:44.440> 270<00:00:44.950> lumens<00:00:45.640> it's<00:00:45.790> only<00:00:45.940> gonna

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
mode which is 270 lumens it's only gonna

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.840 
mode which is 270 lumens it's only gonna
last<00:00:46.300> about<00:00:46.510> 15<00:00:47.050> minutes<00:00:47.580> and<00:00:48.580> it's<00:00:48.730> gonna

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
last about 15 minutes and it's gonna

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.760 
last about 15 minutes and it's gonna
last<00:00:49.120> about<00:00:49.300> an<00:00:49.540> hour<00:00:49.630> altogether<00:00:50.440> because

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770 
last about an hour altogether because

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.610 
last about an hour altogether because
it'll<00:00:51.010> switch<00:00:51.220> into<00:00:51.520> a<00:00:51.550> reserve<00:00:51.880> mode<00:00:52.620> the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
it'll switch into a reserve mode the

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.070 
it'll switch into a reserve mode the
stream<00:00:53.950> light<00:00:54.160> with<00:00:54.700> the<00:00:54.910> Terra<00:00:55.390> Lux<00:00:55.630> upgrade

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.080 
stream light with the Terra Lux upgrade

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.440 
stream light with the Terra Lux upgrade
in<00:00:56.230> it<00:00:56.350> it's<00:00:56.500> gonna<00:00:56.620> last<00:00:56.980> about<00:00:57.490> two<00:00:58.240> and<00:00:58.390> a

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
half hours so it's got a lot better burn

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:08.760 
half hours so it's got a lot better burn
time<00:01:01.600> on<00:01:01.780> it<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:07.119> first<00:01:07.420> I'm<00:01:07.840> gonna<00:01:07.990> just<00:01:08.289> show

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
you the 511 light on the it's actually

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.639 
you the 511 light on the it's actually
just<00:01:11.950> the<00:01:12.039> regular<00:01:12.280> run<00:01:12.729> mode<00:01:13.109> this<00:01:14.109> it'll<00:01:14.499> run

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649 
just the regular run mode this it'll run

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:16.260 
just the regular run mode this it'll run
this<00:01:14.859> way<00:01:14.979> for<00:01:15.189> about<00:01:15.249> an<00:01:15.460> hour<00:01:15.549> before<00:01:16.030> it

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
this way for about an hour before it

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.399 
this way for about an hour before it
switches<00:01:16.509> into<00:01:16.869> the<00:01:18.630> ultra<00:01:19.630> reserve<00:01:20.079> mode

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409

which is quite a bit dimmer and then the

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.289 
which is quite a bit dimmer and then the
high<00:01:23.710> mode<00:01:24.009> on<00:01:24.189> this<00:01:24.399> light<00:01:24.640> is<00:01:24.880> going<00:01:25.060> to<00:01:25.119> be

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
high mode on this light is going to be

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:30.020 
high mode on this light is going to be
that<00:01:27.149> as<00:01:28.149> a<00:01:28.210> comparison<00:01:28.810> the<00:01:29.109> Terra<00:01:29.380> Lux<00:01:29.619> bulb

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
that as a comparison the Terra Lux bulb

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.779 
that as a comparison the Terra Lux bulb
is<00:01:31.030> going<00:01:31.240> to<00:01:31.299> be<00:01:31.389> that<00:01:31.659> so<00:01:32.109> it's<00:01:32.259> got<00:01:32.469> a<00:01:32.789> lot

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789 
is going to be that so it's got a lot

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:35.910 
is going to be that so it's got a lot
brighter<00:01:34.630> light<00:01:35.020> out<00:01:35.229> of<00:01:35.380> it<00:01:35.499> and<00:01:35.649> it's<00:01:35.770> got<00:01:35.889> a

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
brighter light out of it and it's got a

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.669 
brighter light out of it and it's got a
lot<00:01:36.100> bigger<00:01:36.280> a<00:01:36.460> halo<00:01:37.090> around<00:01:37.240> it<00:01:37.600> too<00:01:37.840> I<00:01:38.079> don't

00:01:38.669 --> 00:01:38.679 
lot bigger a halo around it too I don't

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:40.379 
lot bigger a halo around it too I don't
know<00:01:38.799> if<00:01:38.920> I<00:01:39.100> can<00:01:39.429> I'll<00:01:39.639> try<00:01:39.789> to<00:01:39.880> show<00:01:40.090> you<00:01:40.149> both

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
this that's wrong I'm gonna be pretty

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.600 
this that's wrong I'm gonna be pretty
decent<00:01:54.530> both<00:01:54.740> of<00:01:54.920> them<00:01:56.710> the<00:01:57.710> 5-11<00:01:58.159> light<00:01:58.460> is

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
decent both of them the 5-11 light is

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.719 
decent both of them the 5-11 light is
definitely<00:01:59.920> pretty<00:02:00.920> good<00:02:01.219> for<00:02:01.429> its<00:02:01.520> size<00:02:01.700> and

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
definitely pretty good for its size and

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.760 
definitely pretty good for its size and
weight<00:02:01.969> it's<00:02:02.539> just<00:02:02.810> not<00:02:02.960> gonna<00:02:03.110> run<00:02:03.409> as<00:02:03.560> long

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
weight it's just not gonna run as long

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.429 
weight it's just not gonna run as long
and<00:02:04.009> it's<00:02:04.189> not<00:02:04.369> gonna<00:02:04.520> be<00:02:04.729> as<00:02:04.939> bright<00:02:05.329> as<00:02:05.600> the
