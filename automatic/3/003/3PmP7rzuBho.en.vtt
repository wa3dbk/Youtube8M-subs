00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:08.490
 it's good hello you have before you 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:13.259
 an e350 acer a great device 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:17.340
 the proof so here for example I 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:20.130
 look i'm going to look at a newspaper where 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.039
 normally you have a function 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.470
 rotation to know that it's a device 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.900
 I bought in March 2013 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.410
 since my i have already sent him back three 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.969
 times or in acer workshops and he 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.420
 still not walking so you see I have 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:39.719
 pressed on the on the app that 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.450
 I do not walk I do not work 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.260
 more so now so there is little one 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.739
 Who walks 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.910
 well here is take is blocked here so 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.750
 I unlock 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:55.559
 when I unblock is a black window 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:58.410
 for days I'm leaning outside and 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.649
 this is what happens to me regularly I 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.140
 returns in applications 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:06.659
 So here you are is at a trick 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.950
 black without stopping without stopping without stopping 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:13.560
 ibug and I can not do anything if that 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.130
 does not remove the battery turn it off and 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.990
 start over here is acer little 350 after 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.610
 of some manipulations I arrived 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.460
 japy back on the app 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.810
 it's still black and I'm pretty 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.110
 they'll say it's normal 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.210
 So here is manage supported on another 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.079
 application 20 minutes 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.790
 that's it worked there is nothing that works 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:37.430
 here is after a few moments 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.259
 worthy to get going 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.320
 I'm running because I have the 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.810
 rotate rotating sailboat function 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.509
 very well so he does not turn then 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:53.130
 that the ch and miss o scoring of the screen 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:55.649
 I'm coming out alas the bonus plays with 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.390
 amazes smartphones and I'm supposed 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:02.390
 call so I'll call 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.390
 here 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:14.180
 here I am supporting and that's black so 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.830
 it's going to sound and that's it to cut the 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:22.030
 the only way 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:22.030
