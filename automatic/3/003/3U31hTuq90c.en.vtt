00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.070
 well, everyone knows 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.080
 million 73 and today we get 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.090
 find for a tutorial a new 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.029
 tutorial how to put music 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.409
 on to sancya stone I saw that there 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.989
 had no music the music of 

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:22.039
 minecraft on asos are a bit of the game 

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:23.239
 was a little sad 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.499
 there was no music so it was 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:26.989
 a little boring sometimes when you are 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:28.819
 alone alone and precisely I'm going 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:30.409
 make a video on how to put it 

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:33.080
 so I just discovered that now 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:35.300
 because in fact there is now so I 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.070
 am accompanied by centaur 0 actually 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.140
 hello everyone I'll just remember 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.300
 companion of this video so then in 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.430
 do I do not hear you download 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.410
 microbes imported from crack pan and 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.060
 I looked at this I went in to 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.100
 7 and I saw that there was music 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.070
 all that stuff so I have to see them I 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:56.030
 does it like that it fits a point a 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.280
 sense ya is normally the no will be 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.910
 added and in fact I had seen that there 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.590
 had just icons languages ​​and sound &amp; 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.960
 read me to the machine 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.600
 So I said but if we wait 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.039
 would put all this in this in this 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.270
 file maybe that music 

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:14.780
 would walk will be essential 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:17.990
 so I tested I put all this in 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:21.439
 have in the forum in the sas a scent of 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.649
 old haha ​​and so I 'll go to 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:26.329
 sancya and 30 minutes after the music 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:28.700
 was darting so I was so grateful 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:30.039
 happy good there I was doing 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.619
 something on a 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:34.609
 so here I was serious happy about this 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.959
 that I had managed to put some 

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:38.149
 music on associa that there was no 

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:40.759
 of music so the creators dacia 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:41.959
 can you do the update for 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:42.979
 put some music but good me 

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:44.810
 now it's like I did 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.219
 an update but I'm really 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.259
 So here we go 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:50.659
 normally concede essential 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:53.359
 should just see it appear there 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.549
 file there this file there and this file 

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:57.229
 there while the other assets so he 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.849
 You just have to add this file here 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.649
 this file there these files this this 

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:01.849
 poster he was going to get in there and you 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.279
 will have music so I have music 

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:06.679
 who is in power which I am going to 

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:08.300
 to make music dance and listen to 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:10.860
 micra music 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.520
 see if the minecraft music our so 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.790
 the pianos 1 and pique et cetera I think 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.810
 also make another video 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.080
 maybe because you can watch 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.640
 that its parts it's through a video player 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.250
 a windows media player 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.680
 so I will think that by putting the same 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.740
 files in on another music like 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.570
 for example stromae or thursday other 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.820
 set to music eminem this as per 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.520
 example we can put them on this 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.720
 file there I'll try if that 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.230
 walk I will make a new life video 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.510
 above 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.250
 a tutorial so here we want to do 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.519
 I hope you have understood all that 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.500
 I told you so if you say that it 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.820
 does not work at first it's normal 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.470
 if we have to wait for a good moment 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.580
 so you can see the aca not the 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.489
 music that not yet put what in 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.930
 makes music that is just compatible 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.489
 with because I actually have a point these 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.320
 two points 2 while at social and 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.540
 of borrowing 6.4 so in fact you find yourself 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.730
 a must me download online crafton 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.900
 a 6.4 pan to put on a social 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.920
 that's what I'm going to do because I 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.810
 it is in thought of two sides of so 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.880
 that's why it does not work too well 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.610
 perfectly this trial that music but 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.430
 a long time but try to put these 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.350
 files there at a point 6.42 susurra 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.049
 social so I hope this video 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.180
 you will have enjoyed it's soon christmas in
