00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
like I said before this is

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.789 
like I said before this is
eight<00:02:01.490> Jill<00:02:02.119> and<00:02:02.390> I<00:02:02.840> will<00:02:02.899> do<00:02:03.140> a<00:02:03.170> close-up<00:02:03.500> on

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
eight Jill and I will do a close-up on

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.770

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
what this looks like on the inside so

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.109 
what this looks like on the inside so
it's<00:02:05.929> a<00:02:05.990> jelly<00:02:06.259> and<00:02:06.560> so<00:02:07.310> all<00:02:07.640> the<00:02:07.880> lush

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
it's a jelly and so all the lush

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.410 
it's a jelly and so all the lush
products<00:02:08.629> they<00:02:08.720> have<00:02:08.750> a<00:02:09.259> an<00:02:10.209> expiration<00:02:11.209> date

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
products they have a an expiration date

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.110 
products they have a an expiration date
because<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:12.140> products<00:02:12.530> are<00:02:12.650> all<00:02:13.120> natural
