using<00:03:48.189> triggers<00:03:48.459> you<00:03:49.269> can<00:03:49.480> try<00:03:49.689> and<00:03:49.750> fake<00:03:50.079> it

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.109 
using triggers you can try and fake it

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:52.229 
using triggers you can try and fake it
by<00:03:50.439> having<00:03:50.650> physics<00:03:51.159> inactive<00:03:51.730> on<00:03:51.909> both<00:03:52.209> your

that when physics do become active there
will<00:04:01.720> be<00:04:01.840> a<00:04:01.870> short<00:04:01.959> burst<00:04:02.440> of<00:04:02.680> extra<00:04:03.099> energy
