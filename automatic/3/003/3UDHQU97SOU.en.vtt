00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:05.910
 Hello dear colleagues 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.670
 it is about the milk foam of the 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.800
 new machines where he already a two times 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.290
 the case had both cleaning 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.990
 a little more foam up here 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.230
 I can imagine coming out 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.689
 why it could be and I'll do it 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.760
 with you a disassembly and one 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.660
 complete installation of the milk foam 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.160
 I can take the milk apart 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.619
 containers as in the traditional way 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.620
 by taking it apart 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.989
 position is the whole pull out here 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.690
 our head the climber completely 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.879
 take out at the top 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:46.350
 this is a variant under normal 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.760
 circumstances completely sufficient if then 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.160
 maybe still to this area 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.500
 take apart then foam up 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.170
 with the two concave convex radeon 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:00.449
 the ones in here are the work as one 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.980
 still remain if I as 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.930
 Special case is apart 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.420
 should have taken or apart 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.430
 wants to take it can squeeze it here 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.490
 can again with gentle force the whole 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.770
 pull apart when I do that 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.729
 opens the second chamber of the 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.570
 Milk frother up here 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.790
 taken apart is the whole 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.979
 quickly is important is only if I 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.960
 will assemble complete back up here 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.420
 is a seal with incorporated 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.060
 framework and this upswing must be 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.150
 put together completely here again 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.460
 that means I have to complete this 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.640
 Whole one has to hook up too 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.380
 check again that the frame 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.869
 100 percent on the right position 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.030
 because otherwise it will all be here 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.250
 top leaking and I'm both flushing 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:52.369
 completely out as you could see here 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:54.509
 here will not work 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.890
 that means I have to do it all again 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.369
 after correcting that he really does 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.719
 100 also really good in it hopes that 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.719
 whole can work as well 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.229
 that will probably be the problem 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.260
 why most of you already know me 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.270
 mounted him not work so well 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.730
 is the whole in the conventional way 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.410
 and wisely and I would 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.280
 say just try it 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.650
 variant 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.660
 then also the cleaning would have to 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.080
 problems also be resolved 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:29.040
 I wish you much fun with that of 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:34.200
 the tip of the dear hat for the border 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.200
 compartments are a lot of success at pos
