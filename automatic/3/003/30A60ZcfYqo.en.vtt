00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.870
 Hello to you all set and today we 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.650
 we will learn to do 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:20.560
 stand-up ground strafe using stand-up 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.619
 ground straight or sgs can be typed 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.090
 pretty fast speed and also possible 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.809
 very beautiful 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:33.120
 cheat inexperienced players like those 

00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:35.770
 which you now see well let's start 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.530
 as always we start with the settings 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:41.200
 keyboard 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.480
 it's pretty simple here 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.440
 just put on scrolling 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.440
 wheel down squat alternative 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:57.640
 button and squats you have left 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:01:02.100
 left counter so guys I climbed in 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:05.530
 Online watched videos teaching grandfather 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.649
 honest well, not a fig is not clear mine as 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.409
 clear, well, not everything seems to me 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:13.329
 novice will be hard to understand all 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:17.829
 these buttons that appear then 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:20.590
 disappear and in general I decided to speak 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:22.289
 the whole thing in words that was not 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.929
 no questions asked 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:28.149
 before you learn how to do gs to me 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:29.170
 it seems you need to master another technique 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.939
 movement 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.939
 it's called file and ran 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.229
 everything is very simple settings here 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.229
 Keyboards are the same than she 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:45.570
 different from sgs is that we run by 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.860
 direct run in a straight line and just alternate 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.390
 pressed 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.740
 scroll wheel down press 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.740
 counter keys 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.439
 water run and push the wheel contour 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:04.299
 released counter wheel contour 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:06.490
 released the contour and then not with this 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:09.940
 movement your speed remains 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:16.360
 almost the same but the steps become 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:19.630
 much quieter to do sgs after that 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.299
 as we hit a second for example we 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:26.040
 we clamp at first strafe then 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:29.400
 scroll the wheel and press counter 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:33.660
 release the counter then we press 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.530
 opposite strafe we ​​twist the wheel and 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.870
 press control 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.150
 then release the contour and repeat this 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.609
 the procedure is basically nothing complicated 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.200
 you just need to remember what u have 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:47.620
 sequences need to be pressed 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.230
 first strafe then scroll the wheel 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.200
 click contours let go of contra and you 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.230
 so on here we only have one 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.060
 difference from savant early is that what 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.400
 the very throne we press the forward button a 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:04.139
 here we alternate straight &amp; a and d and 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.139
 turn the mouse in the appropriate direction
