00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.580
 A girl is the first time we 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.170
 I'm recording here from my 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.570
 last time I recorded, I recorded in 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.059
 home and I came here to make a video 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.400
 quickly shown you is regarding 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.590
 Personal base asks me to tell me 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.199
 one more time she's talking right 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.960
 tell me is that the minimum base checks and that 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.880
 the delta base sticking too much to show 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.949
 How can I mix it? 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.320
 I have a little bottle that has already emptied the 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.439
 ideal is a new video of them 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.210
 So I have actually I have 13 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.219
 That's what I 'll do when you 're staying when 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.070
 the mixture will be all transparent 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.860
 I put mind that he had written it 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.809
 mixed with the knowledge that it has already been mixed 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.789
 that does not add more neighborhood and al 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.250
 It's milan 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.760
 so this is it is written with the pen 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.620
 glued with durex and then may fall 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.750
 business that will always have no problem 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:01.710
 I'm going to open a little bottle of 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:05.390
 to detect colorless basbug and I will split 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.390
 this glass here in the three 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:24.119
 I do not know if you give so you can see the 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.700
 We are more or less in the Sabino eye. 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.560
 exactly where 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.880
 although you turn some of the base 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:46.119
 given here is going to make a big difference and 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:51.340
 got to wrap the star, I'll get the 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:53.500
 ideal base that is new to open eve 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.310
 I'm going to share this book with those 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.920
 three 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:04.239
 Pedro, loot there, you guys. 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:08.200
 will see the difference of the base of the ideal 

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:13.870
 for bile as it is more oily it is for 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:16.480
 Because silicon has it then it 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.200
 leaves the base more sticky 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.849
 and when we make the detour, 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.400
 that way they sometimes put themselves through 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:31.299
 top sticks first base comes out all 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:34.319
 world I do not know if you will 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.319
 province in the video 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:38.829
 we are seeing is low 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.870
 underneath the belly and the fifth from above 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:50.040
 ideal 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:55.120
 baby, I'll get another glass of my friend's and I'll 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:57.639
 divide between the three again to this 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:03.970
 here is this glass that I can complete 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:08.019
 with base of bic is if not descends glass 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:10.380
 here I'm going to get another one inside just to 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.380
 complementary 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.360
 the objective to take another serving glass 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:38.340
 to fill the same video and or 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:41.840
 complement of this will not reach 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.840
 use the three books not 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.989
 to leave a space to mix 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.510
 and still under the shock of glass 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:00.569
 I do not know how much fear that comes down here but 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:08.310
 I used it here it's here 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:13.260
 behind two 120 ml glasses of big or 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:19.590
 5 of 60 ml of the ideal and more or less one 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:24.150
 little more than half of the big I will close 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:27.830
 again at the base and try to avoid 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:30.840
 to join the clothes try to avoid putting together 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:34.400
 based on the peak because how can 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.400
 get much harder than april 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:41.669
 I sewed now and I'm going to shake 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:44.190
 or give us also stirred haia 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:47.190
 teacher gives love who stays 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:52.139
 We're going to mix it up just for 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:54.300
 Move well , you let it rest. 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.940
 You can use the truth to make it possible. 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:00.780
 because it is already well mixed at 0 to 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:04.440
 difference in content is what this is here 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:08.010
 these improvements are basic 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:11.240
 the video is that if these things 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:16.669
 strange that it is already from the base but 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.669
 delta on top and ends up being lighter 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:22.500
 the history of water with oil nfa 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:26.879
 mix site that ours but mix there 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:31.080
 We sewed the same thing. 

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:32.639
 These girls are good to make you go. 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.599
 use the same amount of base 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:38.460
 she did not give me very dry rope rope and 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:41.400
 also will not stick together with the 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.409
 ideal is that you will be able to spend well 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.719
 less because this little glass that must have 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:48.270
 almost in the range of 10 reais and this one from here 

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:51.449
 I actually paid 10 and 50 where I 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:53.009
 I bought here I bought the house closed 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:55.500
 That's it girls I hope you 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:58.349
 Have you liked a jewel and do not forget 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:02.389
 to share on the channel and 

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:02.389
 A kiss for you and a Czech.
