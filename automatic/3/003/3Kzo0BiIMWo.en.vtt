00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:04.910
 the guys have the conditions 

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:16.449
 Dr 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:20.640
 from next year to friends 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.330
 especially of at least once a year so they cut a density of green 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.470
 Form wall 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.470
 and not completely out of shape 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.279
 a good time is from June 24 to the St. John's Day 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.930
 then most trees and bushes are in the first year 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.040
 completed 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.390
 and purely with the so-called Johannistrieb a second time through 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.240
 my name is the GEF 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.730
 and I'll show you what they need to look out for when cutting hedge 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.030
 the most energetic tool is who else is the helicopter 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.120
 then the coach must always have green as cherry laurel 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.890
 It is best to take a hand hanging clipper 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.890
 so that the leaves are not shredded too much 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.340
 SID Colom hang for a long time 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.340
 It is best to slip on electric hedge trimmers 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.180
 For more concealment consists of two opposing rails 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.580
 with short created more St 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.330
 between these are the respective shoots are cut off before 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.670
 Here you go a few safety tips 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.190
 They had the hedge trimmer extension cable in this fear 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.470
 unite 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.200
 so they prevent the plug from the socket dissolves when they are on 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.670
 Pull the cable 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.000
 is there hedge trimmers not equipped with a so-called pulled relief 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.400
 Fasten the extension cable you need to have the best fit 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.190
 if you are not wearing glasses 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.190
 They should wear light safety goggles when cutting the hedge 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.990
 Gloves protect hands from injury from thorns 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.700
 for safety reasons 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.979
 you have to use both hands at the same time 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.539
 two starts push buttons 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:06.239
 so that the hedge trimmer runs PrÃ¶ll petty would have so 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.919
 which in turn become a little narrower 

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:12.059
 this so-called camped profile 

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:13.679
 and take care of that 

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:16.799
 that even the bottom two games get approved 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.359
 By no means does the group leader say 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:21.909
 because otherwise she gets stuck with time and 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.749
 how does the lateral vehicle cut so much? 

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:29.349
 by dropping the knife in slow steady movements from below 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.199
 to pull up 

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:34.159
 The perpetrators are cut back so far that they are one level 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:36.179
 Surface is created 

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:39.759
 Now you give the crown of hackers to a single percent 

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:44.179
 This is best done by placing the hedge trimmer with your arms in one 

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:48.189
 hold horizontal position and with a slight bruise from the back 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:49.929
 swing back and forth 

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:51.079
 in this way 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:54.189
 cut back for the entire midfield step by step 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:55.459
 pensive 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.879
 and if you had the cut branches many Brunner and would have the 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:01.879
 Technology together 

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:04.759
 dollar / hard 

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:07.739
 the reason that only come together or 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.420
 Emilia hedge trimmer always runs well is always well maintained it should Nina 

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:14.419
 invite everyone to a soft brush 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:19.569
 also 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.649
 Do you want to connect the fair to the car with a biological 

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:26.449
 Chainsaw oil rubbing in. He may want his hedge to the final in the 

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:28.889
 Beat late summer or early spring 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:32.529
 While irritated per year, above all, the stack of gasoline hedge plants make sense 

00:03:32.529 --> 00:03:34.139
 the dear sda 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:36.709
 or about these Heimbucher ago 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.709
 Now I wish him a lot of fun with that quickly 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:50.379
 Where 

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.359
 Bern
