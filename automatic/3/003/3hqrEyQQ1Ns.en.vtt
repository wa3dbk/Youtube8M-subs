00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.880 

yeah<00:02:32.080> that's<00:02:32.290> a<00:02:32.380> good<00:02:32.500> rimming<00:02:34.620> there<00:02:35.620> we<00:02:35.740> go

you've<00:02:36.130> been<00:02:36.250> throwing<00:02:36.460> in<00:02:36.700> so<00:02:36.820> many<00:02:36.970> ways<00:02:37.150> I

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
you've been throwing in so many ways I

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.480 
you've been throwing in so many ways I
know<00:02:38.640> it's<00:02:39.640> good<00:02:39.790> job<00:02:39.970> um<00:02:40.180> so<00:02:41.050> I<00:02:41.410> could<00:02:42.370> have

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
know it's good job um so I could have

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.699 
know it's good job um so I could have
probably<00:02:42.700> done<00:02:43.540> a<00:02:43.600> little<00:02:43.810> better<00:02:44.110> very

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
probably done a little better very

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.090 
probably done a little better very
pretty<00:02:44.950> it's<00:02:45.340> not<00:02:45.490> pretty<00:02:45.670> uh-huh<00:02:46.620> but<00:02:47.620> the

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
pretty it's not pretty uh-huh but the

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.830 
pretty it's not pretty uh-huh but the
problem<00:02:48.280> is<00:02:48.550> I<00:02:48.790> don't<00:02:48.910> really<00:02:49.180> have<00:02:49.570> a

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
problem is I don't really have a

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.020 
problem is I don't really have a
successful<00:02:50.290> way<00:02:50.650> of<00:02:50.920> getting<00:02:51.580> sugar<00:02:51.790> on<00:02:51.970> a

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
goblet I have you know it's easy to do

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.979 
goblet I have you know it's easy to do
for<00:02:54.910> for<00:02:55.570> the<00:02:55.660> other<00:02:55.780> type<00:02:55.959> but<00:02:56.470> whatever<00:02:56.860> so

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
for for the other type but whatever so

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.270 
for for the other type but whatever so
good<00:02:58.989> to<00:02:59.110> go<00:02:59.230> then<00:02:59.440> what<00:02:59.890> we're<00:02:59.980> going<00:03:00.040> to<00:03:00.190> do

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
good to go then what we're going to do

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.030 
good to go then what we're going to do
is<00:03:00.520> build<00:03:01.090> I'm<00:03:01.780> going<00:03:02.020> to<00:03:02.080> build<00:03:02.260> it<00:03:02.410> in<00:03:02.590> an

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
is build I'm going to build it in an

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
it but I also don't want to build it in

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.590 
it but I also don't want to build it in
a<00:03:12.459> glass<00:03:12.550> it<00:03:12.850> has<00:03:12.940> some<00:03:13.090> ramen<00:03:13.300> you<00:03:13.360> don't<00:03:13.480> want
