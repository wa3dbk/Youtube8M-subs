00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 Dreda double decomposition 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.060
 How do we know what "cat" means? 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.500
 Is it simply to point to the animal we never call 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.000
 And then say the word 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.500
 20th century philosopher Jacques Derrida will say "no" 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.000
 The word cat is not simply a reference to the four-legged fluff 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.500
 Which is different from your existence 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.000
 In other words, we do not know the meaning of "never" so easily 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 Language is a little more complicated 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.800
 Thinkers such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. Establish their philosophy on the existence of "objective truth" 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.400
 Which can be approached through philosophy. They thought philosophy was a journey 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:56.400
 Through which the truth and the falsity of our beliefs are revealed in the end 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:03.400
 For Derrida, the adoption of logic as a means of understanding objective truth is in itself problematic 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:10.400
 Disassembly is the means to prove that our assumptions about language and objectivity are false 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 There is no reference outside the text. There is no room for thinking outside the language 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.200
 No true or true words of deeds or things 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.400
 There is no objective fact 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.400
 There is no indication of the words themselves 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.400
 Kick-off kick with Snarflack 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.600
 The punch with "Film Flam" 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.800
 The boy with "Abobo" or the cat with "Zotkornorgjax" 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.600
 It is as true as any other word 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.000
 In his book "On the grammar," Derrida said his famous saying 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.900
 There is nothing outside the text 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.000
 What it means 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.400
 We understand everything in the world via language 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.000
 And therefore can not escape 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 The way we learn the language 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 Not to come across the true essence of the term 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.700
 But the meaning of the relationship with other words 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.500
 Or as Derrida calls it the difference 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.200
 For example: 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.500
 We know the meaning of "never" because we understand the idea of ​​snakes 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.200
 Domestic animal, and pet 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.000
 We understand the animal as not wild 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.900
 As a friend 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.700
 The friend understands that he is not the enemy 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.900
 We define the enemy as the counterforce 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.400
 We know that force in this sense is not the product of the force of force in acceleration 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.500
 But an entity or a person 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.500
 And we know that man is not an animal 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.300
 Not at all 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.700
 Each concept shows another concept 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.400
 We know and know even infinity 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.600
 So we know the term tortoise and so on 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.400
 All texts are therefore unreliable 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.900
 There is no single or objective meaning to the words 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.800
 Most texts contain conflicting narratives 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.900
 Intersect and contradict 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.000
 Disassembly refers to these contradictions 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.600
 Thus the deconstruction is built and dismantled at the same time 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.400
 Thus playing on the words 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.800
 But when does the dismantling end? 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.000
 And is the cat really just a cat?
