00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.620
 Sunday, June 12, 2011 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.940
 with the list of bicycle tracks in hand 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.020
 I've traveled 98 km 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:32.320
 looking for bike tracks in Bucharest 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.620
 I tried to respect the law 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.320
 with the risk of being ABSURD 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.560
 I was INSISTENT 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.000
 but AM FOST INVINS 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.500
 I was regarded as a DREAM 

00:01:27.294 --> 00:01:31.114
 but I did not DO GREAT GESTES 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.760
 all the filming were recorded on the only "finalized" tracks in Bucharest 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.500
 It is NOT a bike track! 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.980
 This is a bike track in Bucharest! 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.700
 This is a bicycle track in Novi Sad! 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.020
 This is a bicycle track in Osijek! 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.140
 This is a bicycle track in Budapest! 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.940
 OPTAR.ro will analyze the 10 "completed" tracks in Bucharest 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.300
 Sorry!
