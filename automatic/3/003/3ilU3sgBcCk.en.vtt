00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149
 yeah 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.000
 hello because I love flowers 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.959
 I decided to give you a little check 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.120
 yeah I do not see the report either 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:17.470
 but you'll see it's very beautiful and that 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.760
 worth a look at the deadline 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.630
 look at the ingredients and which one we are 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.630
 found in the kitchen 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.070
 I start to prepare the cream at 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.250
 butter for that I'm going elsewhere 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.960
 prepared a syrup with sugar 8 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.820
 centilitres of water and a few drops of 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.469
 lemon juice 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.699
 at the time the sugar syrup is formed there 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.530
 it must come to a boil and 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.239
 then it muddy for at least two 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.310
 minutes during this time we're going 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.869
 take care of the eight egg yolks and 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:14.960
 two whole bones that we're going to whip at 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:17.570
 robot jacquot carry sugar syrup 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.960
 in net while the robot is in 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.700
 road 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.280
 it is now the turn of the butter 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.190
 ointment to gradually integrate the 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.080
 mixing with a robot still running 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.030
 and here we get a very beautiful 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.330
 Thursday kremlin aim at butter cream 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.700
 in three and I color them each one 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.600
 little idea is to get three 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.819
 different oranges 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.610
 I reserve each butter cream in 

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:42.710
 a different socket pocket 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.659
 we prefer the Genoese pata and for that I 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.220
 will work the soft butter to the robot 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.220
 with sugar and vanilla sugar 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:56.289
 I add the eggs one by one I will finally 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.289
 add the flour mixture and water 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.100
 I divide the dough into 6 finally it takes 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.470
 since equal pensions will cook 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.209
 the same time france where i'm going 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.560
 now colored in orange so 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.819
 progressive all my paws 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.530
 I have my eight orange colors 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.360
 different users to make a beautiful 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.280
 degraded I cook them each 12 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.010
 minutes at 180 degrees in our circles at 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.599
 pastry 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.180
 yeah I'm fine evenly dough in 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:27.000
 the mold 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.620
 Let's go 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.810
 I now proceed to assemble the 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.540
 cake so I'm going to stack the Genoese 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.370
 from the most sensible to the clearest in 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.290
 putting between the two a layer of 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.470
 mascarpone simply club with a little 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.470
 sugar 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.210
 I use the rest of the frosting at 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.900
 mascarpone for mas foot and fill the 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.900
 small wheels on the side 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:55.680
 Come on, I'm going to make little spikes 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.680
 like that 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.400
 you have to take about half of the 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.680
 petal and hop we just crush on the 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.510
