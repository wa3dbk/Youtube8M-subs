going<00:02:02.530> to<00:02:02.679> stick<00:02:02.979> and<00:02:03.670> you're<00:02:03.880> just<00:02:04.030> going<00:02:04.209> to

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.329 
going to stick and you're just going to

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:07.440 
going to stick and you're just going to
pull<00:02:04.749> off<00:02:05.159> kind<00:02:06.159> of<00:02:06.219> smaller<00:02:06.549> pieces<00:02:06.909> of<00:02:07.270> dough

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
pull off kind of smaller pieces of dough

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.809 
pull off kind of smaller pieces of dough
and<00:02:07.749> just<00:02:08.020> roll<00:02:08.470> them<00:02:08.800> they<00:02:09.190> are<00:02:09.310> going<00:02:09.610> to

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
and just roll them they are going to

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.180 
and just roll them they are going to
double<00:02:10.270> in<00:02:10.509> size<00:02:10.539> so<00:02:11.110> don't<00:02:11.350> pull<00:02:11.680> off<00:02:11.830> a<00:02:11.860> piece

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
double in size so don't pull off a piece

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.820 
double in size so don't pull off a piece
that<00:02:12.220> is<00:02:12.670> too<00:02:13.450> large<00:02:13.780> so<00:02:14.260> I<00:02:14.290> have<00:02:14.560> made<00:02:14.710> about

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
that is too large so I have made about

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.460 
that is too large so I have made about
this<00:02:15.160> size<00:02:16.030> and<00:02:16.390> you're

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
this size and you're

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.050 
this size and you're
going<00:02:17.620> to<00:02:17.740> do<00:02:17.890> that<00:02:18.070> with<00:02:18.250> all<00:02:18.490> of<00:02:18.640> your<00:02:18.790> dough

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
going to do that with all of your dough

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.360 
going to do that with all of your dough
and<00:02:19.450> laid<00:02:19.750> out<00:02:19.900> on<00:02:20.170> your<00:02:20.320> cookie<00:02:20.620> sheet<00:02:20.650> you

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
and laid out on your cookie sheet you

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.980 
and laid out on your cookie sheet you
might<00:02:21.610> even<00:02:21.760> need<00:02:22.030> two<00:02:22.360> cookie<00:02:22.720> sheets

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
might even need two cookie sheets

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.260 
might even need two cookie sheets
because<00:02:23.500> these<00:02:23.770> like<00:02:24.310> I<00:02:24.460> mentioned<00:02:24.880> are<00:02:25.000> going

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
because these like I mentioned are going

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.660 
because these like I mentioned are going
to<00:02:25.390> double<00:02:25.780> in<00:02:25.930> size<00:02:25.960> so<00:02:26.890> once<00:02:27.190> you<00:02:27.310> have<00:02:27.520> them

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
to double in size so once you have them

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.960 
to double in size so once you have them
all<00:02:28.500> rolled<00:02:29.500> out<00:02:29.770> you're<00:02:30.070> going<00:02:30.310> to<00:02:30.400> cover

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
all rolled out you're going to cover

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.230 
all rolled out you're going to cover
them<00:02:31.360> and<00:02:31.630> let<00:02:31.690> them<00:02:32.680> rise<00:02:33.010> for<00:02:33.460> an<00:02:33.550> hour<00:02:33.760> and

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
them and let them rise for an hour and

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.630 
them and let them rise for an hour and
that's<00:02:34.690> a<00:02:34.780> good<00:02:34.960> time<00:02:35.260> to<00:02:35.590> make<00:02:35.920> whatever<00:02:36.400> else

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
that's a good time to make whatever else

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.950 
that's a good time to make whatever else
you're<00:02:36.880> going<00:02:37.000> to<00:02:37.090> make<00:02:37.270> I'm<00:02:37.450> going<00:02:37.750> to<00:02:37.870> make
