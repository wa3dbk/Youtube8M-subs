moons it's basically Mars though so this

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.509 
moons it's basically Mars though so this
is<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.960> decent<00:00:24.960> medium<00:00:25.949> sized<00:00:26.189> map<00:00:26.519> as<00:00:28.519> good

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
is a decent medium sized map as good

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.620 
is a decent medium sized map as good
sniping<00:00:30.029> lanes<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.689> played<00:00:32.149> also<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.180> main

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
sniping lanes and played also a main

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.950 
sniping lanes and played also a main
building<00:00:34.079> in<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.290> center<00:00:34.469> there<00:00:35.840> and<00:00:36.840> we

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
building in the center there and we

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.780 
building in the center there and we
found<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.380> was<00:00:37.500> best<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.890> go<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.160> this<00:00:38.370> middle

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
found it was best to go to this middle

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.470 
found it was best to go to this middle
area<00:00:38.940> over<00:00:39.390> here<00:00:39.420> where<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.290> was<00:00:40.410> quite<00:00:40.710> open

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
area over here where it was quite open

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.049 
area over here where it was quite open
the<00:00:42.480> point<00:00:42.840> spawns<00:00:43.530> right<00:00:43.829> on<00:00:44.010> be<00:00:44.280> where<00:00:44.760> the

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
the point spawns right on be where the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.760 
the point spawns right on be where the
normally<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:45.539> in<00:00:45.660> domination<00:00:46.110> right<00:00:46.469> in<00:00:46.620> this

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
normally is in domination right in this

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:54.080 
normally is in domination right in this
middle<00:00:47.100> area<00:00:51.530> so<00:00:52.530> it's<00:00:53.430> just<00:00:53.640> like<00:00:53.760> any<00:00:53.969> other

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
middle area so it's just like any other

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.639 
middle area so it's just like any other
trials<00:00:54.539> match<00:00:54.899> just<00:00:57.170> you<00:00:58.170> want<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.410> be<00:00:58.500> where

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649

trials match just you want to be where
your<00:00:58.800> enemies<00:00:59.190> are<00:00:59.219> but<00:01:00.140> not<00:01:01.140> rush<00:01:01.469> them

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
your enemies are but not rush them

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.490 
your enemies are but not rush them
unless<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:02.010> have<00:01:02.100> shotguns<00:01:02.640> really<00:01:06.500> partying

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
unless you have shotguns really partying

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.539

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.160 

you're<00:01:17.560> in<00:01:17.770> overtime<00:01:18.490> if<00:01:19.420> you<00:01:19.570> can't<00:01:19.810> kill

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
you're in overtime if you can't kill

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.440 
you're in overtime if you can't kill
them<00:01:20.380> capture<00:01:21.220> the<00:01:21.340> zone<00:01:21.580> I<00:01:21.880> will<00:01:22.180> fast

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
them capture the zone I will fast

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.750 
them capture the zone I will fast
forward<00:01:22.690> you<00:01:23.440> to<00:01:23.890> the<00:01:24.280> heavy<00:01:24.760> round<00:01:25.119> it<00:01:25.750> spawns

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
forward you to the heavy round it spawns

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.070 
forward you to the heavy round it spawns
way<00:01:27.760> to<00:01:27.820> the<00:01:28.000> left<00:01:28.270> and<00:01:28.479> way<00:01:28.630> to<00:01:28.690> the<00:01:28.840> right

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
way to the left and way to the right

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.070 
way to the left and way to the right
there's<00:01:29.500> one<00:01:29.560> inside<00:01:29.890> and<00:01:30.130> outside<00:01:30.960> going<00:01:31.960> to

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
there's one inside and outside going to

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.960 
there's one inside and outside going to
the<00:01:32.200> inside<00:01:32.619> one<00:01:32.860> would<00:01:33.040> probably<00:01:33.610> be<00:01:33.759> better

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
the inside one would probably be better

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.399 
the inside one would probably be better
because<00:01:34.240> you're<00:01:34.509> more<00:01:34.690> protected<00:01:35.229> by<00:01:35.350> the

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
because you're more protected by the

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.130 
because you're more protected by the
walls<00:01:35.740> and<00:01:36.100> you<00:01:36.159> have<00:01:36.280> the<00:01:36.399> upper<00:01:36.670> ground<00:01:37.140> we

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
walls and you have the upper ground we

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.370 
walls and you have the upper ground we
just<00:01:39.100> decided<00:01:39.490> to<00:01:39.670> go<00:01:39.790> to<00:01:39.850> the<00:01:40.240> lower<00:01:41.080> one

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
just decided to go to the lower one

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.609 
just decided to go to the lower one
outside<00:01:41.890> but<00:01:42.420> we<00:01:43.420> got<00:01:43.570> pretty<00:01:43.750> lucky<00:01:44.020> here<00:01:44.470> and

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
outside but we got pretty lucky here and

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.560 
outside but we got pretty lucky here and
i<00:01:44.740> managed<00:01:45.430> to<00:01:45.460> pick<00:01:45.670> up<00:01:45.759> the<00:01:45.880> double<00:01:46.149> kill<00:01:46.330> we

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
i managed to pick up the double kill we

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.070 
i managed to pick up the double kill we
won<00:01:48.030> but<00:01:49.030> going<00:01:49.210> to<00:01:49.300> the<00:01:49.390> inside<00:01:49.899> will

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
won but going to the inside will

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.779 
won but going to the inside will
probably<00:01:50.649> be<00:01:50.770> more<00:01:50.920> favorable<00:01:51.190> as<00:01:51.640> it's

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
probably be more favorable as it's

00:01:51.789 --> 00:02:15.800 
probably be more favorable as it's
closer<00:01:52.149> to<00:01:52.330> the<00:01:52.570> spawns<00:01:52.899> as<00:01:53.229> well

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.470 

so<00:02:16.810> yeah<00:02:16.960> just<00:02:17.260> a<00:02:17.440> senior<00:02:18.040> Matt<00:02:18.220> leg<00:02:19.060> feeling

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
so yeah just a senior Matt leg feeling

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.650 
so yeah just a senior Matt leg feeling
with<00:02:19.720> a<00:02:19.750> through<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.650> trials<00:02:21.160> is<00:02:22.030> spent<00:02:22.420> chums

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
with a through the trials is spent chums

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.370 
with a through the trials is spent chums
gaming<00:02:23.370> piece
