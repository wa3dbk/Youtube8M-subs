MTV<00:00:11.340> flew<00:00:11.550> me<00:00:11.670> down<00:00:11.700> I<00:00:11.849> did<00:00:12.179> two<00:00:12.330> pilots<00:00:12.780> for

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
MTV flew me down I did two pilots for

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.749 
MTV flew me down I did two pilots for
them<00:00:13.080> neither<00:00:13.590> of<00:00:13.710> which<00:00:13.740> got<00:00:14.009> picked<00:00:14.250> up<00:00:14.429> and

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
them neither of which got picked up and

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.189 
them neither of which got picked up and
I<00:00:14.849> kind<00:00:15.089> of<00:00:15.150> figured<00:00:15.389> they<00:00:15.480> would<00:00:15.660> because<00:00:15.870> MTV

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
I kind of figured they would because MTV

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.420 
I kind of figured they would because MTV
has<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.320> certain<00:00:16.619> look<00:00:16.770> they<00:00:16.920> go<00:00:17.039> for<00:00:17.310> it<00:00:17.340> you

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
has a certain look they go for it you

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.650 
has a certain look they go for it you
know<00:00:17.520> I<00:00:19.699> think<00:00:20.699> it<00:00:20.789> will<00:00:20.850> be<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:20.970> lot<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.210> fun<00:00:21.449> but

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
know I think it will be a lot of fun but

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.450 
know I think it will be a lot of fun but
it<00:00:21.750> was<00:00:21.840> ultimately<00:00:22.170> depressing<00:00:22.890> because

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
it was ultimately depressing because

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.320 
it was ultimately depressing because
there<00:00:23.580> are<00:00:23.640> just<00:00:23.730> things<00:00:23.939> in<00:00:24.119> life<00:00:24.300> that

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
there are just things in life that

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.300 
there are just things in life that
reminds<00:00:24.900> you<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.050> what<00:00:25.289> an<00:00:25.410> old<00:00:25.710> out-of-shape

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310
