00:00:00.749 --> 00:00:06.790
 hello this a video tutorial on how 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:09.250
 stick your gopro on a helmet in 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:12.849
 this case this is a helmet to go 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:16.090
 with the rollers or I will use it to go with the 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:23.590
 free board and you'll need these 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:29.550
 pieces a curved attack and these three 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:33.699
 parts that I found in the package 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:37.329
 sport because greyback and inside were there 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:41.499
 also other parts and then three will be needed 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:42.899
 screws one of the two smaller and one more 

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:49.230
 long 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:49.230
 Let's start by removing the red plastic 

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:54.039
 only to vast red because I saw 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.710
 some videos where people ask themselves 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:01:03.120
 the gray part should also be removed instead 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:06.040
 no the one used to attack and the 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:11.500
 position where you want 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:13.270
 I like it here up front so it doesn't 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:18.990
 there is so much difference between what 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.990
 I see it is what the friend sees though 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:26.280
 then just wait a while for it to do 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.280
 socket 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.530
 wait for it to take hold 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.880
 pressed as you like 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.880
 as much as you want 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:51.480
 ok we attached the part to the helmet 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.480
 and it's really frontal as you can see 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.710
 at this point you will need this piece 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.980
 this piece that must be attached to head in 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.190
 down ie with this side facing 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.190
 the low 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:18.910
 the attack take the gopro canvas 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:21.870
 fixed in this way fixed with the 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.870
 life is bigger 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:33.600
 ok and tighten at this point you have lake 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:37.480
 pro attached to the helmet and positioned 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.540
 aspects of the position you want in 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:46.390
 down at the bottom but I prefer to keep it in 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:49.870
 this way here ok there is an alternative on 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:54.760
 how to put the gopro using the others 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:58.720
 two parts that I showed you before and 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:05.910
 you can do it this way attack 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:16.650
 this this part with the small screw 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:16.650
 what to put this and this here 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.580
 so 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:34.390
 tighten and finally put your own 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:38.680
 with the big life this way 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:42.970
 you will be able to have a different view 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:49.170
 with the gopro and I will go so bending it 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:49.170
 as you wish and more we are here 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:57.090
 you will be able to take yourself back 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.090
 turning it over they cover in this way 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.190
 to the next
