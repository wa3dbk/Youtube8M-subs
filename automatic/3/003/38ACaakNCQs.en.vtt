again she's constantly trying to pull
the<00:01:56.910> key<00:01:57.150> okay<00:01:57.480> not<00:01:57.720> just<00:01:57.750> give<00:01:58.200> up<00:02:00.290> let's<00:02:01.290> try

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
the key okay not just give up let's try

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.710 
the key okay not just give up let's try
it<00:02:01.590> again<00:02:01.710> with<00:02:01.890> another<00:02:02.550> key<00:02:05.479> this<00:02:06.479> key

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
it again with another key this key

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
it again with another key this key
doesn't<00:02:06.930> even<00:02:07.170> have<00:02:07.440> an<00:02:07.590> RFID<00:02:08.070> chip<00:02:08.160> at<00:02:08.520> all

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:20.810 

same<00:02:13.740> here<00:02:19.010> let's<00:02:20.010> try<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.430> again

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
same here let's try that again

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.620 
same here let's try that again
same<00:02:21.780> key<00:02:22.459> I'm<00:02:23.459> going<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:23.730> bring<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:24.090> other

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
same key I'm going to bring the other

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:35.510 
same key I'm going to bring the other
key<00:02:24.959> closer

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.660 

I<00:02:35.550> don't<00:02:36.210> know<00:02:36.300> if<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:36.690> or<00:02:37.020> see<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.440> cute<00:02:37.770> code

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
I don't know if it or see the cute code

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:57.740 
I don't know if it or see the cute code
or<00:02:39.000> not<00:02:39.210> so<00:02:39.690> straight<00:02:39.990> again

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:05.580 

maybe<00:02:58.750> if<00:02:58.870> I<00:02:58.960> put<00:02:59.200> the<00:02:59.380> key<00:03:00.010> underneath<00:03:00.430> it<00:03:04.590> the

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
maybe if I put the key underneath it the

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:15.660 
maybe if I put the key underneath it the
nose<00:03:05.770> trip<00:03:13.170> put<00:03:14.170> the<00:03:14.320> right<00:03:14.920> hand<00:03:14.950> let<00:03:15.460> me<00:03:15.520> get

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
nose trip put the right hand let me get

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:24.030 
nose trip put the right hand let me get
touch<00:03:15.940> so<00:03:16.510> happens

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.509

here is a barbecue just

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.339 
here is a barbecue just
comparison<00:03:28.519> this<00:03:29.420> one<00:03:29.659> detects<00:03:30.049> it<00:03:30.230> right

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:30.349 
comparison this one detects it right

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:34.730 
comparison this one detects it right
away

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.370 

let's<00:03:35.310> try<00:03:35.580> a<00:03:35.610> key<00:03:36.330> for<00:03:36.570> a<00:03:36.630> different<00:03:37.020> make<00:03:37.200> of

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
let's try a key for a different make of

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:44.720 
let's try a key for a different make of
car<00:03:39.620> doesn't<00:03:40.620> it<00:03:40.710> fit<00:03:40.950> in

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730

Oh<00:03:51.920> didn't<00:03:52.920> work<00:03:53.069> in<00:03:53.879> battery<00:03:54.840> so<00:03:55.019> my<00:03:55.170> radio

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
Oh didn't work in battery so my radio
