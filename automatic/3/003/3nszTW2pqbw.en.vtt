 the game from the base of all the learnings 

00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:14.999
 the games stimulates creativity 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:19.039

 keep playing with your children when they stop being children 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.119
 present in the elections 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.519
 we propose some simple and fun games 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:31.230
 so that their children develop their next rival 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.530
 I remove so much uu 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.690
 the triumph of 2011 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.080
 there are a lot of games that allow us to teach children 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.030
 these games 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.500
 They are perfect for any time especially for travel 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.020
 the fire should break down if it were the same as the river vero 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.020
 with the difference that here you have to guess a word 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.200
 that does not exist in these images 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.020
 is not physically present 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.180
 for example 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.530
 would see if I were in the north pole in the query that finally begins 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.500
 no child 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.410
 it's a game 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.470
 which consists of completing a list of words that follow the same end 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.180
 example of the will come a ship loaded with words that begin with 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.210
 hour 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.650
 we can vary the game 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.090
 also from the letter m 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.840
 the rule is to look for words that end with a certain entity 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.730
 yes the chain 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.710
 This fun game consists of making a string of words 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.640
 so we start from any word and we take last letter to link the 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.710
 the rest 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:54.609
 in the game 

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:57.640
 we can introduce variations like not repeat myself 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.340
 one of the words he has said is 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.610
 do not use proper names play only with men from the semantic field 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:04.840
 determined 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.890
 such as food or animals 

00:02:11.679 --> 00:02:14.789
 currently x as today 

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:17.789
 in this game the x is a festival 

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:20.899
 it's a man starts all 

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:23.899
 someone who puts an end 

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:27.569
 the other players continue fast 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:28.869
 with a rayon 

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:31.449

 all players messi 

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:36.319
