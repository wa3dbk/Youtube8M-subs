alright<00:00:06.320> how<00:00:06.710> did<00:00:06.860> you<00:00:06.950> come<00:00:07.130> to<00:00:07.160> be<00:00:07.340> involved

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:07.580 
alright how did you come to be involved

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.090 
alright how did you come to be involved
in<00:00:07.819> the<00:00:07.910> student<00:00:08.210> project<00:00:08.570> symposium<00:00:09.110> um<00:00:09.290> so

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:10.100 
in the student project symposium um so

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.100 
in the student project symposium um so
I'd<00:00:10.370> actually<00:00:10.549> presented<00:00:11.150> this<00:00:11.420> research<00:00:11.840> at

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110 
I'd actually presented this research at

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.040 
I'd actually presented this research at
another<00:00:13.099> similar<00:00:13.460> conference<00:00:13.910> the<00:00:14.780> the

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:15.050 
another similar conference the the

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.720 
another similar conference the the
answer<00:00:15.410> key<00:00:15.559> undergraduate<00:00:16.160> student<00:00:16.520> fair

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:16.730 
answer key undergraduate student fair

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.070 
answer key undergraduate student fair
and<00:00:17.510> so<00:00:17.750> I<00:00:17.779> saw<00:00:18.430> I'd<00:00:19.430> seen<00:00:19.910> this<00:00:20.090> thing<00:00:20.300> at<00:00:20.570> seen

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
and so I saw I'd seen this thing at seen

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.370 
and so I saw I'd seen this thing at seen
the<00:00:21.289> symposium<00:00:21.890> advertised<00:00:22.400> and<00:00:22.699> I<00:00:23.180> it<00:00:23.810> seemed

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
the symposium advertised and I it seemed

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.650 
the symposium advertised and I it seemed
like<00:00:24.529> a<00:00:24.560> really<00:00:24.740> good<00:00:24.859> opportunity<00:00:25.130> to<00:00:25.660> to

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
like a really good opportunity to to

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.300 
like a really good opportunity to to
present<00:00:26.960> my<00:00:27.050> research<00:00:27.080> and<00:00:27.439> get<00:00:27.650> involved<00:00:28.160> in

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
present my research and get involved in

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.179 
present my research and get involved in
that<00:00:28.460> sort<00:00:28.820> of<00:00:28.880> thing<00:00:28.939> and<00:00:29.300> so<00:00:29.960> I<00:00:30.289> really<00:00:31.010> it

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
that sort of thing and so I really it

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:32.560 
that sort of thing and so I really it
was<00:00:31.220> through<00:00:31.460> the<00:00:31.550> publicity<00:00:31.789> of<00:00:32.059> the<00:00:32.119> USS<00:00:32.449> you

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
was through the publicity of the USS you

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.600 
was through the publicity of the USS you
that<00:00:32.750> I<00:00:32.780> discovered<00:00:33.170> it<00:00:33.410> and<00:00:33.530> and<00:00:34.040> found<00:00:34.460> out

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
that I discovered it and and found out

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.160 
that I discovered it and and found out
about<00:00:34.760> it<00:00:34.879> and<00:00:35.000> was<00:00:35.480> able<00:00:35.570> to<00:00:35.720> become<00:00:35.840> involved

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
about it and was able to become involved

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.290 
about it and was able to become involved
I<00:00:36.500> do<00:00:37.339> you<00:00:37.519> know<00:00:37.580> how<00:00:37.729> others<00:00:37.970> could<00:00:38.210> be

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
I do you know how others could be

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.420 
I do you know how others could be
involved<00:00:38.659> in<00:00:38.780> this<00:00:38.839> in<00:00:39.019> the<00:00:39.080> future<00:00:39.199> um<00:00:39.620> it's

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
involved in this in the future um it's

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.149 
involved in this in the future um it's
definitely<00:00:40.879> um<00:00:41.510> talking<00:00:42.470> through<00:00:42.650> department

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:43.159 
definitely um talking through department

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:44.680 
definitely um talking through department
getting<00:00:43.430> involved<00:00:43.760> in<00:00:44.059> different<00:00:44.180> research

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
getting involved in different research

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.890 
getting involved in different research
and<00:00:44.960> just<00:00:45.489> and<00:00:46.489> and<00:00:47.000> really<00:00:47.210> just<00:00:47.449> signing<00:00:47.809> up

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:47.900 
and just and and really just signing up

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.509 
and just and and really just signing up
and<00:00:48.110> putting<00:00:48.500> a<00:00:48.650> project<00:00:49.040> out<00:00:49.159> there<00:00:49.370> I<00:00:49.400> think

00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:49.519 
and putting a project out there I think

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:51.549 
and putting a project out there I think
letting<00:00:49.879> people<00:00:50.390> know<00:00:50.420> all<00:00:50.720> the<00:00:50.900> different

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
letting people know all the different

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:53.229 
letting people know all the different
projects<00:00:52.070> that<00:00:52.339> you<00:00:52.460> can<00:00:52.729> do<00:00:52.970> at<00:00:53.120> this

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
projects that you can do at this

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.079 
projects that you can do at this
university<00:00:53.570> so<00:00:54.400> how<00:00:55.400> could<00:00:55.610> you<00:00:55.760> briefly

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:56.089 
university so how could you briefly

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.810 
university so how could you briefly
describe<00:00:56.180> for<00:00:56.690> me<00:00:56.750> your<00:00:56.839> project<00:00:57.409> ok<00:00:58.280> so<00:00:58.339> my

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
describe for me your project ok so my

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.549 
describe for me your project ok so my
projects<00:00:59.239> to<00:00:59.360> Nam<00:00:59.570> theoretical<00:01:00.290> computer

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
projects to Nam theoretical computer

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.009 
projects to Nam theoretical computer
science<00:01:01.040> so<00:01:01.129> I'm<00:01:01.220> looking<00:01:01.400> at<00:01:01.839> kind<00:01:02.839> of<00:01:02.960> the

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
science so I'm looking at kind of the

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:04.810 
science so I'm looking at kind of the
borderline<00:01:03.589> between<00:01:03.619> math<00:01:04.190> and<00:01:04.460> computer

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
borderline between math and computer

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.609 
borderline between math and computer
science<00:01:04.850> in<00:01:05.449> particular<00:01:05.840> here<00:01:06.049> I<00:01:06.080> was<00:01:06.290> looking

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
science in particular here I was looking

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:08.950 
science in particular here I was looking
at<00:01:06.850> the<00:01:07.850> different<00:01:08.360> ways<00:01:08.540> you<00:01:08.570> can<00:01:08.810> use

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
at the different ways you can use

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.920 
at the different ways you can use
computers<00:01:09.710> to<00:01:09.740> help<00:01:10.310> kind<00:01:10.670> of<00:01:10.789> prove<00:01:11.450> prove

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
computers to help kind of prove prove

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.749 
computers to help kind of prove prove
different<00:01:12.350> theorems<00:01:12.710> and<00:01:12.890> prove<00:01:13.159> prove

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
different theorems and prove prove

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:16.450 
different theorems and prove prove
different<00:01:14.149> things<00:01:14.420> about<00:01:14.689> math<00:01:14.930> and<00:01:15.560> with<00:01:16.340> the

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
different things about math and with the

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.010 
different things about math and with the
different<00:01:16.789> way<00:01:16.909> that<00:01:17.149> you<00:01:17.270> ways<00:01:17.659> you<00:01:17.840> can

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
different way that you ways you can

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.899 
different way that you ways you can
interleave<00:01:18.859> letters<00:01:19.310> of<00:01:19.579> different

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
interleave letters of different

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.120 
interleave letters of different
different<00:01:20.570> words<00:01:20.840> different<00:01:21.289> strings<00:01:21.950> of

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
different words different strings of

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.219 
different words different strings of
zeros<00:01:22.369> and<00:01:22.520> ones<00:01:22.640> it's<00:01:23.509> something<00:01:23.689> called<00:01:23.960> the

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
zeros and ones it's something called the

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.139 
zeros and ones it's something called the
the<00:01:24.619> shuffle<00:01:25.009> operator<00:01:25.369> and<00:01:25.549> so<00:01:25.640> I<00:01:25.670> was<00:01:25.850> I<00:01:26.030> was

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
the shuffle operator and so I was I was

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:27.580 
the shuffle operator and so I was I was
looking<00:01:26.479> at<00:01:26.539> the<00:01:26.630> properties<00:01:27.049> of<00:01:27.079> that<00:01:27.380> and

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
looking at the properties of that and

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.499 
looking at the properties of that and
trying<00:01:27.799> trying<00:01:28.310> to<00:01:28.460> explore<00:01:28.789> something<00:01:29.210> that

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
trying trying to explore something that

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:30.969 
trying trying to explore something that
that<00:01:29.719> really<00:01:29.960> we<00:01:30.170> don't<00:01:30.619> have<00:01:30.770> a<00:01:30.799> lot<00:01:30.829> of

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
that really we don't have a lot of

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.279 
that really we don't have a lot of
knowledge<00:01:31.219> about<00:01:31.429> right<00:01:31.729> now<00:01:32.049> so<00:01:33.049> what<00:01:33.170> did

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
knowledge about right now so what did

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:36.130 
knowledge about right now so what did
you<00:01:33.409> ultimately<00:01:33.560> find<00:01:34.280> out<00:01:34.479> so<00:01:35.479> ultimately<00:01:35.719> I

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
you ultimately find out so ultimately I

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.219 
you ultimately find out so ultimately I
was<00:01:36.469> able<00:01:36.590> to<00:01:36.770> discover<00:01:37.100> about<00:01:37.340> 40<00:01:38.229> patterns

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
was able to discover about 40 patterns

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.399 
was able to discover about 40 patterns
all<00:01:39.409> call<00:01:39.649> them<00:01:39.859> that<00:01:40.759> that<00:01:41.299> words<00:01:41.630> of<00:01:41.990> this

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
all call them that that words of this

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.039 
all call them that that words of this
shuffle<00:01:42.890> operator<00:01:43.249> always<00:01:43.670> follow<00:01:43.939> and<00:01:44.840> and

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
shuffle operator always follow and and

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.889 
shuffle operator always follow and and
so<00:01:45.320> by<00:01:46.280> by<00:01:46.670> discovering<00:01:47.030> these<00:01:47.179> patterns<00:01:47.479> I

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
so by by discovering these patterns I

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.539 
so by by discovering these patterns I
was<00:01:48.170> able<00:01:48.289> to<00:01:48.439> kind<00:01:48.890> of<00:01:49.009> classify<00:01:49.490> the

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
was able to kind of classify the

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.149 
was able to kind of classify the
different<00:01:49.700> words<00:01:50.149> and<00:01:50.990> and<00:01:51.229> speed<00:01:52.130> up

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
different words and and speed up

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.039 
different words and and speed up
techniques<00:01:52.850> for<00:01:53.149> determining<00:01:53.659> things<00:01:53.869> which

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
techniques for determining things which

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:55.750 
techniques for determining things which
before<00:01:54.409> had<00:01:54.469> been<00:01:54.590> really<00:01:54.920> slow

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
before had been really slow

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.560 
before had been really slow
um<00:01:55.910> so<00:01:57.250> so<00:01:58.250> what<00:01:58.400> people<00:01:58.760> are<00:01:58.880> departments<00:01:59.450> did

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
um so so what people are departments did

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:00.840 
um so so what people are departments did
you<00:01:59.660> work<00:01:59.810> with<00:01:59.990> while<00:02:00.200> doing<00:02:00.350> this<00:02:00.530> project

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
you work with while doing this project

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.420 
you work with while doing this project
so<00:02:01.850> my<00:02:02.150> supervisor<00:02:02.630> is<00:02:03.020> Ian<00:02:03.800> McQuillan<00:02:04.250> with

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
so my supervisor is Ian McQuillan with

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.980 
so my supervisor is Ian McQuillan with
the<00:02:04.550> Department<00:02:04.970> of<00:02:05.030> Computer<00:02:05.270> Science<00:02:05.480> and

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
the Department of Computer Science and

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.010 
the Department of Computer Science and
I've<00:02:06.470> definitely<00:02:06.650> worked<00:02:07.190> up<00:02:07.750> entirely<00:02:08.750> with

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
I've definitely worked up entirely with

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.850 
I've definitely worked up entirely with
the<00:02:09.590> Department<00:02:09.979> of<00:02:10.010> Computer<00:02:10.250> Science<00:02:10.520> it's

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
the Department of Computer Science it's

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.770 
the Department of Computer Science it's
through<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:13.130> answer<00:02:13.760> Graham<00:02:14.180> in<00:02:14.300> particular

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
through the answer Graham in particular

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.510 
through the answer Graham in particular
which<00:02:15.290> is<00:02:15.410> a<00:02:15.440> really<00:02:15.560> good<00:02:15.740> way<00:02:15.800> for<00:02:15.950> students

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
which is a really good way for students

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.720 
which is a really good way for students
to<00:02:16.580> let<00:02:17.270> me<00:02:17.420> do<00:02:18.140> research<00:02:18.590> as<00:02:19.130> my<00:02:19.430> summer<00:02:19.640> job

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
to let me do research as my summer job

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.840 
to let me do research as my summer job
so<00:02:20.450> could<00:02:21.410> you<00:02:21.500> just<00:02:21.560> tell<00:02:22.340> system<00:02:22.640> attends

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
so could you just tell system attends

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.820 
so could you just tell system attends
Erick<00:02:23.060> stands<00:02:23.360> for<00:02:23.600> okay<00:02:24.050> oh<00:02:24.170> sorry<00:02:24.410> and<00:02:24.650> surg

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
Erick stands for okay oh sorry and surg

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.100 
Erick stands for okay oh sorry and surg
is<00:02:25.100> I<00:02:25.310> think<00:02:25.580> National<00:02:25.880> Science<00:02:26.630> and

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
is I think National Science and

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.110 
is I think National Science and
Engineering<00:02:27.260> Research<00:02:27.800> Council<00:02:28.400> and<00:02:28.640> so<00:02:29.000> they

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
Engineering Research Council and so they

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.670 
Engineering Research Council and so they
do<00:02:29.180> a<00:02:29.300> lot<00:02:29.480> of<00:02:29.540> funding<00:02:30.080> for<00:02:30.410> different

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
do a lot of funding for different

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.980 
do a lot of funding for different
research<00:02:30.980> projects<00:02:31.490> in<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:32.090> sciences<00:02:32.780> and

research projects in the sciences and

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.140 
research projects in the sciences and
engineering<00:02:33.280> and<00:02:34.280> in<00:02:34.520> particular<00:02:34.940> they<00:02:35.060> have

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
engineering and in particular they have

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.760 
engineering and in particular they have
an<00:02:35.240> undergraduate<00:02:35.690> scholarship<00:02:36.320> which<00:02:36.500> lets

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
an undergraduate scholarship which lets

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.280 
an undergraduate scholarship which lets
which<00:02:37.190> lets<00:02:37.490> a<00:02:37.640> student<00:02:38.000> even<00:02:38.300> as<00:02:38.390> lows<00:02:38.630> even

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
discovered how much I enjoy finding new

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.130 
discovered how much I enjoy finding new
knowledge<00:03:03.980> finding<00:03:04.790> creating<00:03:05.630> things<00:03:05.840> in

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
knowledge finding creating things in

knowledge finding creating things in
discovering<00:03:06.650> things<00:03:06.890> which<00:03:07.220> which<00:03:07.610> really

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
discovering things which which really

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.199 
discovering things which which really
literally<00:03:08.540> a<00:03:08.810> no<00:03:09.650> person<00:03:09.950> has<00:03:10.220> has<00:03:10.970> ever

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
literally a no person has has ever

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.479 
literally a no person has has ever
understood<00:03:11.570> before<00:03:11.900> and<00:03:12.260> so<00:03:12.470> it's<00:03:12.739> undef

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
understood before and so it's undef

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.479 
understood before and so it's undef
initely<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:14.590> the<00:03:15.590> classes<00:03:16.070> you<00:03:16.100> take<00:03:16.370> in

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
initely the the classes you take in

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.460 
initely the the classes you take in
school<00:03:16.790> are<00:03:16.910> very<00:03:17.090> much<00:03:17.330> focused<00:03:18.140> on

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
school are very much focused on

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.680 
school are very much focused on
fulfilling<00:03:19.010> a<00:03:19.430> particular<00:03:19.880> goal<00:03:20.090> or<00:03:20.360> solving

fulfilling a particular goal or solving

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.060 
fulfilling a particular goal or solving
a<00:03:20.750> problem<00:03:20.840> that<00:03:21.110> somebody<00:03:21.410> gives<00:03:21.590> to<00:03:21.769> you<00:03:21.860> and

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
a problem that somebody gives to you and

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.400 
a problem that somebody gives to you and
I<00:03:22.400> think<00:03:22.850> that<00:03:23.150> this<00:03:23.420> this<00:03:23.959> has<00:03:24.260> really

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
I think that this this has really

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.590 
I think that this this has really
enabled<00:03:24.650> me<00:03:24.950> to<00:03:24.980> realize<00:03:25.459> on<00:03:25.790> how<00:03:26.330> much<00:03:26.450> I

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
enabled me to realize on how much I

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.870 
enabled me to realize on how much I
enjoy<00:03:26.900> creating<00:03:27.830> something<00:03:28.370> totally<00:03:28.850> new

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
enjoy creating something totally new

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.229 
enjoy creating something totally new
instead<00:03:29.630> of<00:03:29.660> simply<00:03:30.019> trying<00:03:30.800> to<00:03:30.940> fulfill<00:03:31.940> some

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
instead of simply trying to fulfill some

undirected<00:04:00.410> it's<00:04:00.739> learning<00:04:00.980> how<00:04:01.160> to<00:04:01.430> because

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
undirected it's learning how to because

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.720 
undirected it's learning how to because
there<00:04:02.600> is<00:04:02.840> no<00:04:03.140> right<00:04:03.739> answer<00:04:03.950> there<00:04:04.250> is<00:04:04.280> no<00:04:04.489> way

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
there is no right answer there is no way

there is no right answer there is no way
for<00:04:04.760> you<00:04:05.150> to<00:04:05.180> go<00:04:05.420> nobody's<00:04:05.840> telling<00:04:06.109> you

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520

how<00:04:07.000> to<00:04:07.060> solve<00:04:07.750> this<00:04:07.900> problem<00:04:08.230> because

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
how to solve this problem because

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.260 
how to solve this problem because
nobody's<00:04:08.800> ever<00:04:08.980> solved<00:04:09.310> it<00:04:09.430> before<00:04:09.760> so<00:04:10.210> I

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
nobody's ever solved it before so I

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.100 
nobody's ever solved it before so I
think<00:04:10.360> it's<00:04:10.510> really<00:04:10.750> good<00:04:10.870> at<00:04:10.960> teaching

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
think it's really good at teaching

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.620 
think it's really good at teaching
students<00:04:11.620> how<00:04:11.650> to<00:04:11.800> direct<00:04:12.550> their<00:04:13.030> their<00:04:13.390> own

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
students how to direct their their own

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.720 
students how to direct their their own
research<00:04:14.170> and<00:04:14.290> how<00:04:14.470> to<00:04:14.530> how<00:04:14.890> to<00:04:14.920> discover<00:04:15.400> new

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
research and how to how to discover new

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.240 
research and how to how to discover new
things<00:04:15.959> on<00:04:16.959> their<00:04:17.290> own<00:04:17.320> and<00:04:17.709> so<00:04:17.860> that's<00:04:18.010> that's

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
things on their own and so that's that's

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.130 
things on their own and so that's that's
a<00:04:18.430> skill<00:04:18.700> which<00:04:18.820> you<00:04:18.970> can<00:04:19.090> apply<00:04:19.180> in<00:04:19.660> so<00:04:20.020> many

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
a skill which you can apply in so many

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.530 
a skill which you can apply in so many
different<00:04:20.350> ways
