and<00:00:57.850> I<00:00:58.110> imagine<00:00:59.110> a<00:00:59.200> number<00:00:59.680> that<00:01:00.250> did<00:01:00.719> well<00:01:01.719> I'm

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200 
and I imagine a number that did well I'm

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.049 
and I imagine a number that did well I'm
just<00:01:02.350> a<00:01:02.500> simple<00:01:02.680> sort<00:01:02.980> of<00:01:03.040> guy<00:01:03.160> so<00:01:03.190> I<00:01:03.550> start

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
just a simple sort of guy so I start

years<00:01:16.530> that's<00:01:17.530> just<00:01:17.710> a<00:01:17.860> billion<00:01:18.190> we're

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:18.399 
years that's just a billion we're

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:21.420 
years that's just a billion we're
talking<00:01:18.759> a<00:01:18.850> thousand<00:01:19.690> be<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:21.070> would<00:01:21.220> take

almost thirty two thousand years but

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.210 
almost thirty two thousand years but
that's<00:01:25.179> still<00:01:25.450> only<00:01:25.600> one<00:01:25.959> trillion<00:01:26.440> we're

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
that's still only one trillion we're
