00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
and there's reasons why one their home

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.250 
and there's reasons why one their home
which<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:40.920> that's<00:00:41.820> that's<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.629> be

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
which is that's that's to be

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.080 
which is that's that's to be
understandable<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:43.829> also<00:00:44.129> they<00:00:44.489> are<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.820> team

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
understandable and also they are a team

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.940 
understandable and also they are a team
who<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.300> looking<00:00:46.289> like<00:00:46.559> they're<00:00:46.649> gonna<00:00:46.770> be<00:00:46.890> on

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
who is looking like they're gonna be on

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:47.990 
who is looking like they're gonna be on
the<00:00:47.010> outside<00:00:47.070> looking<00:00:47.340> in<00:00:47.670> when<00:00:47.850> March

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
the outside looking in when March

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.639 
the outside looking in when March
Madness<00:00:48.180> comes<00:00:48.570> they<00:00:48.960> need<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.170> signature<00:00:49.559> win

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
Madness comes they need a signature win

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.290 
Madness comes they need a signature win
and<00:00:50.120> I<00:00:51.120> guess<00:00:51.660> text<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.260> signature<00:00:52.680> win<00:00:53.300> and

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
and I guess text is a signature win and

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.610 
and I guess text is a signature win and
they<00:00:54.570> got<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.079> they<00:00:55.140> needed<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.500> and

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
they got it and they needed it and

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.250 
they got it and they needed it and
that's<00:00:55.829> what<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.039> light<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.280> Clyde<00:00:57.260> from

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
that's what the light of Clyde from

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.700 
that's what the light of Clyde from
Texas<00:00:58.620> point<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:58.920> view<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.280> know<00:00:59.370> really

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
Texas point of view you know really

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.500 
Texas point of view you know really
Texas<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.770> probably<00:01:02.070> getting<00:01:02.399> in<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:03.390> the

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
Texas is probably getting in to the

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.950 
Texas is probably getting in to the
tournament<00:01:04.790> not<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.850> very<00:01:06.090> good<00:01:06.119> seed<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.840> were

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
tournament not a very good seed you were

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.690 
tournament not a very good seed you were
used<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.260> have<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.380> better<00:01:07.560> seed<00:01:07.860> but<00:01:08.460> more<00:01:08.640> than

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
used to have a better seed but more than
