video I'm not going to bother to put it
on<00:01:26.590> this<00:01:27.280> video<00:01:27.580> because<00:01:27.759> it<00:01:28.450> might<00:01:28.690> not<00:01:28.810> even

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
on this video because it might not even

be there when you're watching this

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.460 
be there when you're watching this
because<00:01:31.509> sometimes<00:01:31.690> they<00:01:31.960> get<00:01:32.080> taken<00:01:32.350> down

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
because sometimes they get taken down

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.340 
because sometimes they get taken down
and<00:01:32.740> whatnot<00:01:32.979> anyway<00:01:33.899> so<00:01:34.899> I<00:01:34.930> went<00:01:35.170> to<00:01:35.259> the

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
and whatnot anyway so I went to the

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.410 
and whatnot anyway so I went to the
video<00:01:35.560> and<00:01:35.710> I<00:01:35.740> transcribed<00:01:36.220> three<00:01:36.550> three

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
video and I transcribed three three

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.600 
video and I transcribed three three
choruses<00:01:37.869> now<00:01:38.050> why<00:01:38.649> did<00:01:38.770> I<00:01:38.830> transcribe<00:01:39.340> three

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
choruses now why did I transcribe three

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.730 
choruses now why did I transcribe three
rather<00:01:39.850> than<00:01:40.060> the<00:01:40.630> whole<00:01:40.810> seven<00:01:41.259> well<00:01:41.530> a

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
rather than the whole seven well a

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.010 
rather than the whole seven well a
couple<00:01:41.979> reasons<00:01:42.100> one<00:01:42.670> time<00:01:43.180> because<00:01:43.780> to<00:01:43.960> be

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
couple reasons one time because to be

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.240 
couple reasons one time because to be
able<00:01:44.110> to<00:01:44.200> actually<00:01:44.500> teach<00:01:44.680> you<00:01:44.710> seven

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
able to actually teach you seven

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.200 
able to actually teach you seven
choruses<00:01:45.729> would<00:01:46.149> take<00:01:46.330> multiple<00:01:46.660> DVDs<00:01:48.210> but

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
choruses would take multiple DVDs but

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.330 
choruses would take multiple DVDs but
the<00:01:49.330> other<00:01:49.450> thing<00:01:49.690> is<00:01:49.810> that<00:01:50.080> as<00:01:50.229> a<00:01:50.649> player<00:01:51.040> I

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
the other thing is that as a player I

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.920 
the other thing is that as a player I
don't<00:01:51.520> always<00:01:51.700> like<00:01:52.000> to<00:01:52.119> transcribe<00:01:52.630> like<00:01:52.899> a

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
don't always like to transcribe like a

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.930 
don't always like to transcribe like a
entire<00:01:53.710> solo<00:01:54.100> sometimes<00:01:54.490> you<00:01:54.550> just<00:01:54.610> want

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
entire solo sometimes you just want

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.460 
entire solo sometimes you just want
little<00:01:55.270> snippets<00:01:55.690> of<00:01:55.750> it<00:01:55.899> so<00:01:56.020> what<00:01:56.140> I<00:01:56.170> did<00:01:56.259> was

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
little snippets of it so what I did was

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.800 
little snippets of it so what I did was
I<00:01:56.619> found<00:01:56.830> the<00:01:57.280> three<00:01:57.550> choruses<00:01:58.060> that<00:01:58.119> I<00:01:58.270> really

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
I found the three choruses that I really

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.649 
I found the three choruses that I really
enjoyed<00:01:59.140> and<00:01:59.409> then<00:01:59.860> the<00:02:00.159> third<00:02:00.490> reason<00:02:00.850> is<00:02:01.330> I

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
enjoyed and then the third reason is I

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.450 
enjoyed and then the third reason is I
wanted<00:02:01.930> to<00:02:02.049> show<00:02:02.409> you<00:02:02.440> and<00:02:02.890> prove<00:02:03.070> to<00:02:03.159> you<00:02:03.430> that

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
wanted to show you and prove to you that

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.060 
wanted to show you and prove to you that
when<00:02:04.240> you<00:02:04.390> have<00:02:04.600> a<00:02:04.630> blues<00:02:05.110> you<00:02:05.409> could<00:02:05.560> take<00:02:05.770> one

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
when you have a blues you could take one

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.530 
when you have a blues you could take one
chorus<00:02:06.460> and<00:02:06.610> another<00:02:06.850> and<00:02:07.000> another<00:02:07.090> you<00:02:07.420> can

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
practice this and start to incorporate

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.470 
practice this and start to incorporate
some<00:02:35.739> of<00:02:35.769> this<00:02:35.890> stuff<00:02:36.160> into<00:02:36.790> your<00:02:36.880> own<00:02:37.000> play

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:40.620 
so anyway and then there's also three
separate<00:02:39.880> endings<00:02:40.150> that<00:02:40.269> we're<00:02:40.360> gonna<00:02:40.480> go

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
separate endings that we're gonna go

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.539 
separate endings that we're gonna go
through<00:02:40.930> three<00:02:41.620> really<00:02:41.799> cool<00:02:42.070> endings<00:02:42.459> that

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
through three really cool endings that

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.310 
through three really cool endings that

to<00:03:03.520> get<00:03:03.700> down<00:03:03.910> like<00:03:04.120> this<00:03:04.330> is<00:03:04.480> on<00:03:04.660> f7s<00:03:05.380> coming

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
to get down like this is on f7s coming

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.010 
to get down like this is on f7s coming
down<00:03:05.800> the<00:03:06.040> the<00:03:06.520> 4<00:03:06.790> chord<00:03:07.060> so<00:03:07.210> the<00:03:07.300> b-flat<00:03:07.630> try

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
down the the 4 chord so the b-flat try

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.330 
down the the 4 chord so the b-flat try
it<00:03:08.550> down<00:03:09.550> into<00:03:09.760> major<00:03:10.000> 7th<00:03:10.620> ok<00:03:11.650> and<00:03:11.890> the

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
it down into major 7th ok and the

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:20.339 
it down into major 7th ok and the
resolution<00:03:12.640> points<00:03:13.290> is<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:14.560> flatted<00:03:14.890> 7th

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:25.920 

and<00:03:20.680> it<00:03:20.799> results<00:03:21.159> to<00:03:21.250> be<00:03:21.370> flat<00:03:24.750> so<00:03:25.750> if<00:03:25.840> you're

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
and it results to be flat so if you're

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:40.080 
and it results to be flat so if you're
gonna<00:03:26.049> do<00:03:26.230> root<00:03:26.530> lift<00:03:26.739> cords<00:03:38.849> alright<00:03:39.849> so

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090
