it we cut right through the head of the
lobster<00:04:05.280> it<00:04:06.280> relaxes<00:04:06.730> the<00:04:07.180> lobster<00:04:07.630> you<00:04:07.780> get<00:04:07.930> a

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
lobster it relaxes the lobster you get a

lobster it relaxes the lobster you get a
more<00:04:08.230> tender<00:04:08.500> meat<00:04:08.860> instead<00:04:09.640> of<00:04:09.790> just

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
more tender meat instead of just

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.550

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
dropping it into the water is very

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.539 
dropping it into the water is very
shocking<00:04:12.810> so<00:04:13.810> we<00:04:14.140> like<00:04:14.530> the<00:04:14.680> flavor<00:04:14.950> better<00:04:15.280> so

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549

shocking so we like the flavor better so
we<00:04:15.730> do<00:04:15.940> kill<00:04:16.239> it<00:04:16.359> first<00:04:16.600> we<00:04:17.140> also<00:04:17.350> lightly

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
we do kill it first we also lightly

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.039 
we do kill it first we also lightly
crack<00:04:18.430> the<00:04:18.700> claws<00:04:18.940> before<00:04:19.570> they<00:04:19.720> go<00:04:19.870> into

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
crack the claws before they go into

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.740 
crack the claws before they go into
steam<00:04:20.380> you<00:04:20.590> can<00:04:20.739> see<00:04:20.919> how<00:04:21.070> it's<00:04:21.940> cracked<00:04:22.300> it

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
steam you can see how it's cracked it

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.150 
steam you can see how it's cracked it
just<00:04:23.050> helps<00:04:23.380> it<00:04:23.530> cook<00:04:23.770> things<00:04:24.580> cook<00:04:24.970> different

whole lobster at the same time and we

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.710 
whole lobster at the same time and we
should<00:04:30.520> say<00:04:30.669> that<00:04:30.820> the<00:04:30.940> lobster<00:04:31.330> is<00:04:31.360> a<00:04:31.479> hard
