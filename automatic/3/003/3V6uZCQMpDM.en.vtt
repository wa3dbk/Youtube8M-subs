00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.910
 connect his ps 4 controller to his 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:18.750
 experience and a z 2 you are 3 then 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.900
 you just have to go very easily 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.480
 settings 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:27.660
 then you click on connectivity 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.320
 xperia you go on dual shock 3 of 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.890
 achoppent 4 you choose the dualshock 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.780
 4 because if you have a joystick 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.890
 ps3 just connect it with a 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.050
 cable and all that is sold separately 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.690
 then we come back to our sheep 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.730
 so just click on ps and 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:57.000
 At the same time, we are waiting for the 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:01:01.289
 bar facing then once connected to 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:13.549
 test a pretty cool little game that will 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:13.549
 find there so for the controller 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.220
 and then down we go we play and 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.850
 it would practically do with all 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.630
 games i think 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.509
 after I have not tried all the games so 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.369
 I forgot when we were running 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:42.380
 then we can do it practically 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:43.009
 all the games so the list will be 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.290
 automatically 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:48.040
 otherwise it will ask for orders 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.369
 is going to make a formula no longer then 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.369
 they are better 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:58.970
 on this I tell you good good game with the 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:01.250
 ps3 or ps4 controller on those see you soon 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.179
 for one or another adventure 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.179
 see you soon
