 car dashboard the dashboard information

 this apparatus type apparatus is the hut 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.219
 it was a display and it is a fairly 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.250
 interesting 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.410
 I want to show you today is a 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.149
 experience of this type 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:46.110
 only what I'm using here is a 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:50.640
 tablet is already old the gallerista of r $ 1 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:55.699
 I installed a program that transforms 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:01:00.449
 this galaxy tab in a kind of network 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:04.080
 information is projected by the 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.010
 galaxy tab on panel on windshield 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.740
 my car 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.500
 panel information is projected 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.689
 it does not stop the car breeze to open if 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.189
 he is not prepared to receive the 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.830
 information 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.880
 rand comes with a film you go 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.650
 in a place where the information 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.500
 are going to be designed from the car windshield 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.140
 then the harpsichord windshield and shows the 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.299
 information in much more detail in the 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.259
 My case here is using direct in 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:37.170
 windshield and it does not come with 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.759
 letter does not have film but anyway 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.700
 I'm using here at night, you guys. 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:46.950
 You can see that it gets legal is pretty 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:51.390
 interesting for you to get the 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:55.320

 Quite interesting by day I believe 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.450
 We appeal to people we will not be able to 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.550

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.490
 but it's the tip for you if you do not
