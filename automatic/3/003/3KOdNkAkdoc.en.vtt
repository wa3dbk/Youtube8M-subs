three four five six seven eight nine so
you'll<00:02:06.110> have<00:02:06.230> nine<00:02:06.530> cards<00:02:07.100> out<00:02:07.280> there<00:02:07.390> when

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
you'll have nine cards out there when

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:09.969 
you'll have nine cards out there when
these<00:02:08.479> cards<00:02:08.840> are<00:02:08.929> going<00:02:09.050> to<00:02:09.170> have<00:02:09.349> numbers

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
these cards are going to have numbers

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.949 
these cards are going to have numbers
and<00:02:10.090> eskimos<00:02:11.090> on<00:02:11.269> them<00:02:11.450> so<00:02:11.540> you'll<00:02:11.660> see<00:02:11.810> for

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
and eskimos on them so you'll see for

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.619 
and eskimos on them so you'll see for
example<00:02:11.989> here<00:02:12.410> we<00:02:12.560> have<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.099> five<00:02:13.670> card<00:02:14.150> which

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:14.629 
example here we have the five card which

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:16.540 
example here we have the five card which
simply<00:02:14.959> has<00:02:15.140> number<00:02:15.470> five<00:02:15.680> and<00:02:15.980> it<00:02:16.099> has<00:02:16.220> three

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
simply has number five and it has three

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.009 
simply has number five and it has three
eskimos<00:02:16.970> on<00:02:17.120> it<00:02:17.209> because<00:02:17.390> whoever<00:02:17.629> wins<00:02:17.840> this

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
eskimos on it because whoever wins this

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.380 
eskimos on it because whoever wins this
card<00:02:18.260> would<00:02:18.349> get<00:02:18.500> three<00:02:18.769> points<00:02:18.980> we<00:02:19.879> also<00:02:19.909> have

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
card would get three points we also have

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.910 
card would get three points we also have
a<00:02:20.420> card<00:02:20.750> that<00:02:20.840> has<00:02:20.959> two<00:02:21.260> numbers<00:02:21.530> on<00:02:21.680> it<00:02:21.769> for

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
a card that has two numbers on it for

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.640 
a card that has two numbers on it for
example<00:02:22.220> we<00:02:22.310> have<00:02:22.489> five<00:02:23.180> and<00:02:23.540> six<00:02:23.959> you'll<00:02:24.440> note

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
example we have five and six you'll note

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.350 
example we have five and six you'll note
to<00:02:24.920> Eskimos<00:02:25.280> it's<00:02:25.550> worth<00:02:25.670> two<00:02:25.880> points<00:02:25.910> only

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
to Eskimos it's worth two points only

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.820 
to Eskimos it's worth two points only
because<00:02:27.020> you<00:02:27.170> can<00:02:27.319> win<00:02:27.470> this<00:02:27.590> with<00:02:27.740> either

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
because you can win this with either

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.260 
because you can win this with either
five<00:02:28.160> or<00:02:28.370> a<00:02:28.400> six<00:02:28.550> so<00:02:28.850> it's<00:02:28.970> a<00:02:29.000> little<00:02:29.120> bit

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
five or a six so it's a little bit

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.920 
five or a six so it's a little bit
easier<00:02:29.450> card<00:02:29.960> to<00:02:30.110> win

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
easier card to win

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.839 
easier card to win
and<00:02:31.019> then<00:02:31.140> we<00:02:31.290> have<00:02:31.530> cards<00:02:32.489> with<00:02:32.609> three

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
and then we have cards with three

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.000 
and then we have cards with three
numbers<00:02:33.150> then<00:02:33.299> we<00:02:33.450> have<00:02:33.569> eight<00:02:33.780> nine<00:02:34.049> ten<00:02:34.439> this

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
numbers then we have eight nine ten this

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.690 
numbers then we have eight nine ten this
one<00:02:35.159> only<00:02:35.280> has<00:02:35.370> one

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
one only has one

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.979 
one only has one
Eskimo<00:02:36.150> on<00:02:36.299> it's<00:02:36.510> only<00:02:36.599> worth<00:02:36.780> one<00:02:36.959> point

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
Eskimo on it's only worth one point

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.179 
Eskimo on it's only worth one point
because<00:02:37.409> there<00:02:37.560> are<00:02:37.620> three<00:02:37.859> potential

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:38.189 
because there are three potential

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:41.240 
because there are three potential
members<00:02:38.549> that<00:02:38.670> can<00:02:38.790> win<00:02:38.969> this<00:02:39.150> car<00:02:40.250> once

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
members that can win this car once

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.679 
members that can win this car once
you've<00:02:41.430> laid<00:02:41.579> all<00:02:41.760> this<00:02:41.879> down<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.299> youngest

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:42.689 
you've laid all this down the youngest

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:43.729 
you've laid all this down the youngest
player<00:02:42.840> is<00:02:42.930> going<00:02:43.109> to<00:02:43.170> count<00:02:43.349> to<00:02:43.469> three<00:02:43.709> and

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
player is going to count to three and

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.380 
player is going to count to three and
every<00:02:44.159> player<00:02:44.400> is<00:02:44.519> going<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.760> reach<00:02:44.939> into<00:02:45.239> here

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
every player is going to reach into here

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.490 
every player is going to reach into here
and<00:02:45.510> they're<00:02:45.599> gonna<00:02:45.659> grab<00:02:45.989> one<00:02:46.019> of<00:02:46.290> these

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
and they're gonna grab one of these

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.530 
and they're gonna grab one of these
Eskimos<00:02:47.040> they're<00:02:47.310> gonna<00:02:47.459> shake<00:02:47.730> it<00:02:47.760> and

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
Eskimos they're gonna shake it and

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.209 
Eskimos they're gonna shake it and
they're<00:02:48.810> gonna<00:02:48.930> try<00:02:49.230> and<00:02:49.260> guess<00:02:49.590> how<00:02:50.159> many

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:50.219 
they're gonna try and guess how many

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:51.800 
they're gonna try and guess how many
beads<00:02:50.670> are<00:02:50.879> in<00:02:50.939> these<00:02:51.000> Eskimos<00:02:51.329> they<00:02:51.510> can<00:02:51.659> take

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
beads are in these Eskimos they can take

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.179 
beads are in these Eskimos they can take
one<00:02:52.019> at<00:02:52.139> a<00:02:52.200> time<00:02:52.349> they<00:02:52.469> can<00:02:52.500> shake<00:02:52.799> it<00:02:52.829> they<00:02:53.040> can

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:53.189 
one at a time they can shake it they can

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:55.490 
one at a time they can shake it they can
either<00:02:53.370> decide<00:02:53.700> to<00:02:53.760> bet<00:02:54.540> with<00:02:54.719> this<00:02:54.930> Eskimo<00:02:55.379> or

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
either decide to bet with this Eskimo or

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.629 
either decide to bet with this Eskimo or
place<00:02:55.739> it<00:02:55.920> back<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.219> then<00:02:56.310> they<00:02:56.400> can<00:02:56.519> take

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:56.639 
place it back and then they can take

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:58.520 
place it back and then they can take
another<00:02:56.849> Eskimo<00:02:57.329> so<00:02:57.930> they're<00:02:58.049> gonna<00:02:58.170> shake<00:02:58.379> it

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
another Eskimo so they're gonna shake it

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.420 
another Eskimo so they're gonna shake it
they're<00:02:58.620> gonna<00:02:58.680> try<00:02:58.920> and<00:02:59.010> figure<00:02:59.129> out<00:02:59.219> how

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
they're gonna try and figure out how

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.920 
they're gonna try and figure out how
many<00:02:59.489> beads<00:02:59.790> are<00:02:59.939> in<00:03:00.000> it<00:03:00.090> so<00:03:00.480> let's<00:03:00.659> say<00:03:00.780> for

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
many beads are in it so let's say for

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.030 
many beads are in it so let's say for
example<00:03:00.989> maybe<00:03:01.379> the<00:03:01.469> green<00:03:01.590> player<00:03:01.799> picks

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
example maybe the green player picks

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.319 
example maybe the green player picks
this<00:03:02.189> one<00:03:02.370> enough<00:03:02.549> they<00:03:02.700> think<00:03:02.970> there<00:03:03.180> are

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
this one enough they think there are

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.629 
this one enough they think there are
five<00:03:03.659> Eskimos<00:03:04.409> in<00:03:04.590> here<00:03:04.769> so<00:03:05.250> they're<00:03:05.400> going<00:03:05.579> to

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:05.639 
five Eskimos in here so they're going to

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:06.830 
five Eskimos in here so they're going to
take<00:03:05.790> this<00:03:05.939> one<00:03:06.120> they're<00:03:06.239> gonna<00:03:06.299> place<00:03:06.569> it<00:03:06.720> on

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
take this one they're gonna place it on

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.559 
take this one they're gonna place it on
the<00:03:07.019> five<00:03:07.400> that<00:03:08.400> is<00:03:08.430> their<00:03:08.760> bet<00:03:08.939> that<00:03:09.419> this

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
the five that is their bet that this

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.839 
the five that is their bet that this
Eskimo<00:03:10.049> contains<00:03:10.439> five<00:03:10.680> beads<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.250> they're

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
Eskimo contains five beads and they're

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:12.830 
Eskimo contains five beads and they're
going<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:12.120> move<00:03:12.209> on<00:03:12.389> they're<00:03:12.540> gonna<00:03:12.629> grab

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
going to move on they're gonna grab

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.409 
going to move on they're gonna grab
another<00:03:12.870> another<00:03:13.680> sorry<00:03:14.099> igloo<00:03:15.090> they're

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:15.419 
another another sorry igloo they're

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:16.369 
another another sorry igloo they're
gonna<00:03:15.510> have<00:03:15.629> another<00:03:15.750> igloo<00:03:16.169> and<00:03:16.290> they're

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379 
gonna have another igloo and they're

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:18.110 
gonna have another igloo and they're
gonna<00:03:16.530> shake<00:03:16.799> it<00:03:16.829> see<00:03:17.340> how<00:03:17.459> many<00:03:17.639> beads<00:03:17.879> are

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
gonna shake it see how many beads are

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.479 
gonna shake it see how many beads are
inside<00:03:18.450> of<00:03:18.480> it<00:03:18.739> so<00:03:19.739> maybe<00:03:19.889> they<00:03:20.069> think<00:03:20.250> there's

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
inside of it so maybe they think there's

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.940 
inside of it so maybe they think there's
you<00:03:21.060> know<00:03:21.090> four<00:03:21.510> or<00:03:21.750> three<00:03:21.780> in<00:03:22.139> this<00:03:22.260> one<00:03:22.530> well

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
you know four or three in this one well

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.050 
you know four or three in this one well
they're<00:03:23.069> gonna<00:03:23.159> look<00:03:23.310> around<00:03:23.459> there<00:03:23.700> are<00:03:23.849> no

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
they're gonna look around there are no

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.250 
they're gonna look around there are no
fours<00:03:24.329> or<00:03:24.510> three<00:03:24.659> so<00:03:24.810> maybe<00:03:24.989> they<00:03:25.139> would

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
fours or three so maybe they would

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.690 
fours or three so maybe they would
simply<00:03:25.530> put<00:03:25.680> this<00:03:25.799> one<00:03:25.980> back<00:03:26.099> in<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.370> center

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
simply put this one back in the center

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.849 
simply put this one back in the center
and<00:03:27.209> maybe<00:03:27.359> yellow<00:03:27.659> grabs<00:03:28.079> one<00:03:28.319> they<00:03:28.439> shake<00:03:28.709> it

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
and maybe yellow grabs one they shake it

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:30.530 
and maybe yellow grabs one they shake it
and<00:03:29.010> they're<00:03:29.400> gonna<00:03:29.489> get<00:03:29.669> say<00:03:29.849> maybe<00:03:30.269> there's

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
and they're gonna get say maybe there's

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.240 
and they're gonna get say maybe there's
nine<00:03:30.900> beads<00:03:31.290> in<00:03:31.500> this<00:03:31.650> one<00:03:31.799> they're<00:03:31.919> gonna<00:03:32.010> bet

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
nine beads in this one they're gonna bet

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.939 
nine beads in this one they're gonna bet
that<00:03:32.280> there<00:03:32.840> and<00:03:33.840> blue<00:03:34.139> picks<00:03:34.409> one<00:03:34.620> up<00:03:34.769> and

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
all the igloos are placed and once

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:57.319 
all the igloos are placed and once
you're<00:03:56.639> done<00:03:56.669> with<00:03:56.819> that<00:03:56.909> you're<00:03:57.000> gonna<00:03:57.150> go

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
you're done with that you're gonna go

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.569 
you're done with that you're gonna go
around<00:03:57.419> to<00:03:57.599> each<00:03:57.689> individual<00:03:58.590> card<00:03:58.859> and<00:03:59.069> check

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
around to each individual card and check

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.129 
around to each individual card and check
all<00:03:59.759> the<00:04:00.000> igloos<00:04:00.329> there<00:04:00.540> to<00:04:00.689> see<00:04:00.810> if<00:04:00.930> any<00:04:01.049> of

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:01.139 
all the igloos there to see if any of

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:03.559 
all the igloos there to see if any of
them<00:04:01.319> match<00:04:01.349> the<00:04:02.129> numbers<00:04:02.459> on<00:04:02.609> the<00:04:02.729> card<00:04:02.970> so

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
them match the numbers on the card so

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:04.879 
them match the numbers on the card so
for<00:04:03.720> example<00:04:03.989> we<00:04:04.079> have<00:04:04.199> this<00:04:04.319> one<00:04:04.500> over<00:04:04.680> here

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:04.889 
for example we have this one over here

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:07.520 
for example we have this one over here
that<00:04:05.040> has<00:04:05.519> five<00:04:05.970> on<00:04:06.239> it<00:04:06.269> we're<00:04:07.109> gonna<00:04:07.229> suck

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
that has five on it we're gonna suck

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.800 
that has five on it we're gonna suck
blues<00:04:07.949> igloo<00:04:08.280> first<00:04:08.549> it<00:04:08.790> has<00:04:09.060> three<00:04:09.449> this<00:04:09.659> is

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
blues igloo first it has three this is

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.199 
blues igloo first it has three this is
an<00:04:09.900> incorrect<00:04:10.290> bid<00:04:10.709> his<00:04:11.250> sailor<00:04:11.759> comes<00:04:12.030> off

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
an incorrect bid his sailor comes off

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.479 
an incorrect bid his sailor comes off
and<00:04:12.329> stays<00:04:12.629> there<00:04:12.659> and<00:04:13.139> the<00:04:13.620> igloo<00:04:13.949> goes<00:04:14.250> back

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
and stays there and the igloo goes back

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.159 
and stays there and the igloo goes back
into<00:04:14.699> the<00:04:14.819> center<00:04:15.180> now<00:04:15.720> we're<00:04:15.870> gonna<00:04:15.959> check

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
into the center now we're gonna check

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:17.870 
into the center now we're gonna check
greens<00:04:16.560> and<00:04:16.889> they're<00:04:17.340> gonna<00:04:17.459> look<00:04:17.639> at<00:04:17.759> their

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
greens and they're gonna look at their

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.080 
greens and they're gonna look at their
number<00:04:18.150> and<00:04:18.180> it<00:04:18.570> is<00:04:18.599> indeed<00:04:19.079> five<00:04:19.669> and<00:04:20.669> this<00:04:21.030> is

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
number and it is indeed five and this is

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.600 
number and it is indeed five and this is
going<00:04:21.449> to<00:04:21.539> come<00:04:22.139> off<00:04:22.320> the<00:04:22.590> Thaler<00:04:23.250> is<00:04:23.370> going<00:04:23.520> to

going to come off the Thaler is going to

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:24.980 
going to come off the Thaler is going to
go<00:04:23.699> back<00:04:23.909> to<00:04:23.940> green<00:04:24.330> they<00:04:24.449> get<00:04:24.570> to<00:04:24.659> keep<00:04:24.780> their

they're<00:04:29.909> going<00:04:30.060> to<00:04:30.150> get<00:04:30.240> this<00:04:30.389> card<00:04:30.750> so<00:04:31.050> in

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
they're going to get this card so in

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:32.450 
they're going to get this card so in
this<00:04:31.320> case<00:04:31.530> they<00:04:31.710> have<00:04:31.830> capped<00:04:32.070> their<00:04:32.310> own

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
this case they have capped their own

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.120 
this case they have capped their own
point<00:04:32.789> they<00:04:33.570> have<00:04:33.900> earned<00:04:34.229> a<00:04:34.470> point<00:04:34.650> from<00:04:34.860> blue

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
point they have earned a point from blue

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.089 
point they have earned a point from blue
and<00:04:35.370> they<00:04:35.550> get<00:04:35.699> three<00:04:35.940> points<00:04:36.240> from<00:04:36.419> this<00:04:36.630> card

00:04:37.089 --> 00:04:37.099 
and they get three points from this card

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:39.800 
and they get three points from this card
if<00:04:38.099> for<00:04:38.729> example<00:04:38.759> everyone<00:04:39.330> had<00:04:39.479> been<00:04:39.599> wrong

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
if for example everyone had been wrong

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.480 
if for example everyone had been wrong
everyone<00:04:40.349> would<00:04:40.469> lose<00:04:40.620> their<00:04:40.830> sailor<00:04:41.250> and<00:04:41.430> the

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
everyone would lose their sailor and the

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.240 
everyone would lose their sailor and the
card<00:04:42.300> would<00:04:42.450> not<00:04:42.630> be<00:04:42.779> taken<00:04:43.200> however<00:04:43.830> if<00:04:44.010> blue

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
card would not be taken however if blue

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.570 
card would not be taken however if blue
had

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
had

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.999 
had
right<00:04:44.939> let's<00:04:45.210> say<00:04:45.330> for<00:04:45.479> example<00:04:45.840> this<00:04:46.650> was<00:04:46.889> on

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:47.009 
right let's say for example this was on

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:50.330 
right let's say for example this was on
the<00:04:47.099> five<00:04:47.310> and<00:04:47.340> six<00:04:47.879> card<00:04:48.180> and<00:04:48.740> green<00:04:49.740> had<00:04:49.979> six

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
the five and six card and green had six

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.089 
the five and six card and green had six
in<00:04:50.490> blue<00:04:50.699> had<00:04:50.879> five<00:04:51.150> so<00:04:51.360> they're<00:04:51.509> both<00:04:51.720> right

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:52.099 
in blue had five so they're both right

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:55.429 
in blue had five so they're both right
green<00:04:53.099> would<00:04:53.370> keep<00:04:53.699> their<00:04:54.509> piece<00:04:54.780> blue<00:04:55.229> would

00:04:55.429 --> 00:04:55.439 
green would keep their piece blue would

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:57.379 
green would keep their piece blue would
keep<00:04:55.620> their<00:04:55.860> piece<00:04:56.069> and<00:04:56.280> whoever<00:04:57.060> had<00:04:57.270> the

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
keep their piece and whoever had the

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:59.149 
keep their piece and whoever had the
higher<00:04:57.689> number<00:04:58.110> would<00:04:58.199> get<00:04:58.349> the<00:04:58.469> card<00:04:58.680> so<00:04:58.860> six

00:04:59.149 --> 00:04:59.159 
higher number would get the card so six

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:01.040 
higher number would get the card so six
from<00:04:59.430> green<00:04:59.669> would<00:04:59.879> get<00:05:00.030> the<00:05:00.150> card<00:05:00.419> so

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
from green would get the card so

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.089 
from green would get the card so
everybody<00:05:01.289> gets<00:05:01.439> to<00:05:01.500> keep<00:05:01.620> their<00:05:01.740> piece<00:05:01.949> for

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:02.099 
everybody gets to keep their piece for

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:03.260 
everybody gets to keep their piece for
being<00:05:02.250> right<00:05:02.430> but<00:05:02.639> only<00:05:02.729> the<00:05:02.909> person<00:05:03.120> who<00:05:03.150> is

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
being right but only the person who is

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.089 
being right but only the person who is
the<00:05:03.750> highest<00:05:03.930> number<00:05:04.169> gets<00:05:04.530> to<00:05:04.620> keep<00:05:04.710> the<00:05:04.889> card

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:05.099 
the highest number gets to keep the card

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:07.490 
the highest number gets to keep the card
and<00:05:06.030> you<00:05:06.150> go<00:05:06.300> around<00:05:06.389> resolving<00:05:07.020> then<00:05:07.199> these

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
and you go around resolving then these

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.379 
and you go around resolving then these
in<00:05:07.770> order<00:05:08.340> or<00:05:08.520> whatever<00:05:08.759> order<00:05:09.060> you<00:05:09.090> want<00:05:09.240> it

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:09.389 
in order or whatever order you want it

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:10.850 
in order or whatever order you want it
doesn't<00:05:09.509> really<00:05:09.659> matter<00:05:09.990> figuring<00:05:10.650> them<00:05:10.770> out

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
doesn't really matter figuring them out

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.409 
doesn't really matter figuring them out
so<00:05:11.069> we'll<00:05:11.189> look<00:05:11.280> here<00:05:11.550> yellow<00:05:11.879> guess<00:05:12.090> seven

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 
so we'll look here yellow guess seven

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:13.790 
so we'll look here yellow guess seven
eight<00:05:12.509> or<00:05:12.629> nine<00:05:12.780> well<00:05:13.080> it's<00:05:13.229> nine<00:05:13.379> so<00:05:13.650> they'd

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
eight or nine well it's nine so they'd

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.969 
eight or nine well it's nine so they'd
get<00:05:13.949> this<00:05:14.129> one<00:05:14.340> and<00:05:15.560> purple<00:05:16.560> guessed<00:05:16.770> eight

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
get this one and purple guessed eight

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:19.580 
get this one and purple guessed eight
nine<00:05:17.190> or<00:05:17.370> ten<00:05:17.580> well<00:05:17.819> this<00:05:18.000> one<00:05:18.180> is<00:05:18.330> six<00:05:19.259> so

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
nine or ten well this one is six so

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.050 
nine or ten well this one is six so
they're<00:05:19.710> not<00:05:19.860> right<00:05:20.129> they<00:05:20.550> would<00:05:20.729> lose<00:05:20.849> their

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
they're not right they would lose their

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.219 
they're not right they would lose their
Thaler<00:05:21.419> and<00:05:21.449> this<00:05:21.659> would<00:05:21.780> go<00:05:21.840> back<00:05:21.990> in<00:05:22.139> the

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:22.229 
Thaler and this would go back in the

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:24.230 
Thaler and this would go back in the
center<00:05:22.560> all<00:05:23.009> of<00:05:23.250> the<00:05:23.400> igloos<00:05:23.909> would<00:05:24.030> go<00:05:24.090> back

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
center all of the igloos would go back

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.909 
center all of the igloos would go back
in<00:05:24.360> the<00:05:24.419> center<00:05:24.719> you<00:05:24.840> deal<00:05:25.110> out<00:05:25.259> nine<00:05:25.560> more

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
in the center you deal out nine more

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.700 
in the center you deal out nine more
cards<00:05:26.340> and<00:05:26.430> go<00:05:26.580> around<00:05:27.060> again<00:05:27.270> the<00:05:28.229> game<00:05:28.500> will

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
cards and go around again the game will

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.709 
cards and go around again the game will
end<00:05:28.919> after<00:05:29.219> you<00:05:29.610> get<00:05:29.819> to<00:05:30.150> a<00:05:30.180> round<00:05:30.479> where<00:05:30.659> you

00:05:30.709 --> 00:05:30.719 
end after you get to a round where you

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:33.050 
end after you get to a round where you
can<00:05:30.750> no<00:05:31.080> longer<00:05:31.349> replenish<00:05:31.889> nine<00:05:32.250> cards<00:05:32.849> from

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
can no longer replenish nine cards from

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.909 
can no longer replenish nine cards from
the<00:05:33.180> top<00:05:33.360> of<00:05:33.509> this<00:05:33.629> deck<00:05:33.840> so<00:05:34.110> there's<00:05:34.710> going<00:05:34.860> to

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:34.919 
the top of this deck so there's going to

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:36.980 
the top of this deck so there's going to
be<00:05:35.009> a<00:05:35.069> certain<00:05:35.370> amount<00:05:35.430> of<00:05:35.639> rounds<00:05:36.060> and<00:05:36.659> after

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
be a certain amount of rounds and after

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.209 
be a certain amount of rounds and after
the<00:05:37.139> round<00:05:37.319> where<00:05:37.500> you<00:05:37.560> can<00:05:37.680> no<00:05:37.800> longer<00:05:38.009> put

00:05:38.209 --> 00:05:38.219 
the round where you can no longer put

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:41.330 
the round where you can no longer put
all<00:05:38.370> nine<00:05:38.669> out<00:05:39.000> because<00:05:39.770> you<00:05:40.770> can't<00:05:41.009> refill

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
all nine out because you can't refill

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.890 
all nine out because you can't refill
them<00:05:41.490> there's<00:05:41.669> not<00:05:41.789> enough<00:05:42.060> you're<00:05:42.569> going<00:05:42.810> to

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
them there's not enough you're going to

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.869 
them there's not enough you're going to
end<00:05:43.050> the<00:05:43.259> game<00:05:43.469> and<00:05:43.770> at<00:05:44.099> that<00:05:44.279> point<00:05:44.520> whoever

their own thalers and by collecting

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.149 
their own thalers and by collecting
cards<00:05:51.300> is<00:05:51.419> going<00:05:51.629> to<00:05:51.719> be<00:05:51.840> the<00:05:52.139> winner<00:05:52.319> and

there<00:05:53.520> you<00:05:53.669> have<00:05:53.879> it<00:05:54.029> that<00:05:54.300> is<00:05:54.330> a<00:05:54.810> glue<00:05:55.169> pop<00:05:55.550> now

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
there you have it that is a glue pop now

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.700 
there you have it that is a glue pop now
this<00:05:56.789> is<00:05:57.029> a<00:05:57.060> unique<00:05:57.779> game<00:05:58.050> as<00:05:58.259> I<00:05:58.349> said<00:05:58.560> there's

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
this is a unique game as I said there's

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.050 
this is a unique game as I said there's
really<00:05:58.830> only<00:05:58.919> a<00:05:59.129> couple<00:05:59.490> of<00:05:59.580> games<00:05:59.759> in<00:06:00.029> the
