00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:16.820
 good in video what you are going to do give vocation there is a lot of used 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.849
 to care 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:21.000
 what's important and stop 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.280
 so that the horse and muscles are warmed up and saved it stretches 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:28.410
 you get the body nice and smooth I see 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.859
 and that is a good starting point for the training 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.549
 a good warm up prevent muscle problems and injuries when sailing 

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:37.839
 so it is absolutely important because 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:40.200
 st 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.560
 not immediately seeing during the exercise is changing the bending on the hoses 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.580
 feels 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.360
 after asking the sweetheart of the bow, it is worth taking a few steps 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.090
 went out in the new one 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.580
 you do this because many horses are inclined to change the bow 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.420
 shrug the broad shoulders 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.360
 moving the center of gravity done who is preparing and not going in 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.120
 stayed behind 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.680
 entering a gambling from a cop in the cockpit 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.980
 Yes it is very big and like a lot of emphasis 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.730
 What is important here is that the rider even before he gets it out 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.280
 give it the rein and so follow when the new one went outside 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.010
 first changed and sees itself 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.190
 you can do this at that place we sit down 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.799
 the vip eeklo check if your horse is in the right bow 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.259
 a kiss I think if you but I am x 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.940
 thereby look in the direction at then world and keep your hips 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.110
 holders 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.299
 or you and eyes parallel to those of the horse 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.950
 you know it yourself, as it were, in length bending 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.299
 and this is necessary so as not to obstruct and disturb the horse in its movement 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.429
 here you can see the exercise from pre-filmed 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:08.729
 and I have seen good after changing the pain keep seven on the straight line 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.489
 gold and the outside kitchen applied, with the center of gravity going inwards 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.199
 want to hide 

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:18.079
 the horse is neatly vertical in operation 

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:23.569
 Ramadi March did the pickup in this exercise 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.420
 and increasingly it adopts the new bow and clear line 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.739
 par excellence is that you go it 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:32.649
 shorten 

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:34.599
 and you go faster and faster 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.520
 sleep stands out 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.879
 in the turns 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.439
 a bit but it is still very inclined 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:45.249
 to change there from the tiger to fall within that shoulder 

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:47.239
 then the most u ds 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.199
 take on a few 6 the fire department has 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.289
 to get those kilos of hemp in the night before 

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:59.629
 so that it can also turn in that bend in those days those gaps fall 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:06.289
 I myself have always been very careful that you have the international match in your stomach 

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:09.719
 that is always the March department, as it were 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:12.129
 sitting around you still thinks about it 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:15.129
 is bent in his life 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:21.389
 the advantage of this exercise is that you change frequently 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:26.209
 flexing the pair both sides to make his muscles question shorter 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:27.579
 tension 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.349
 make it long to relax 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:34.469
 and so you get the symmetry and the freezing and the horse is guided 

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:36.629
 nicely lost before training 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:40.540
 as a result, changing too much from the outside also results in beautiful goals for the horse 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.719
 spring and that is another condition to be able to collect well because 

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:48.869
 the trainer with the outdated 

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:53.199
 the like turntable your penis is how your horse feels that day 

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:57.099
 which way on the internet 7 or, for example, I am out of balance 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.819
 you can go on that in sweden and further training 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:07.609
 most but the ones that are changing are going into it 

00:04:08.679 --> 00:04:12.269
 but it can of course also be that the horse brings more weight or she 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:13.799
 to be carried out 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.560
 what you can best do is turn the turn or so the kilos 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.019
 hemp to perform after
