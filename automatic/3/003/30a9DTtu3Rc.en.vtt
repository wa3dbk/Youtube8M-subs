00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:56.470
 here we are right after your 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:59.170
 after their spring and we will end up 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.900
 for a last step ie we 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:05.709
 will rename it by typing doubt so we go 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:09.880
 wait for his bug load which 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:13.300
 This is how it works when buying 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:22.260
 here we are going to call you out of 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:22.260
 you put that you 're going to do 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:34.280

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.160
 more how to name the secret file 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.050
 exactly like the name of the game then 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.010
 you are going to go into typing doubt 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:50.270
 will realize at point ap 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.990
 before updating this sand and calling 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.900
 at the ap point 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:56.120
 it's really stupid to have put this on 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:03.459

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:06.680
 downstairs have it done it's just 2 mega 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:08.830
 then we will stick and crush 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.110
 it's very important 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.840
 yes and that one there is only 11.1 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:18.380
 billion then we'll go while 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.560
 up and we'll pull the bar like that for 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:25.060
 refresh once it's refreshed 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:28.100
 she sees removing terminal from the ram 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:31.190
 do not have to pedals it's up to 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:34.760
 to say that it does not have to be in the 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:38.540
 rame we remove ifile and we will try to 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:41.240
 start the game so it's gone then 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.100
 to activate the pack you need everything 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.000
 simply actually build the house 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:49.570
