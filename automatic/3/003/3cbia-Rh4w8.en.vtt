00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.359
 hello everyone i am rigue litiguen and today you 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.220
 I bring a gameplay of gears of war 1 no 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.889
 it is not that we have crossed the 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.210
 cables or anything like that is not that 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.929
 we have run out of gameplays that 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:19.260
 show you not just what we wanted 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:22.439
 change a little game today and go up 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:26.340
 one to say is to say the best the best 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:30.029
 I do not know if it would be the right word 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.009
 I decide the best go but if I'm sure 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.260
 that if the most worked at the time of 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.380
 development of the game I think it was the one 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.320
 plus the one that worked the most, not that 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:44.430
 of those I will talk later as you are 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.640
 seeing is a deadlocked equal and 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.290
 they were playing both juniors and as 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.050
 ibiza 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:55.110
 mister juniors you have already achieved 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.570
 a game I think you could say 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.840
 he does all the rounds himself 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.660
 - Except for a couple I think you make the 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.670
 rounds of solito as he wants and good 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:11.280
 tell you a little bit about something one that 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.860
 I think there are enough people now that 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.690
 already it has been in my opinion and I 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.910
 I think many of you will think 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.130
 a failure because it has been a failure the 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:24.659
 people who play but I think by playing 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:29.550
 that does have good things and such but 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:33.060
 you just heard all the voices 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.580
 it's a great game but good a great 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.200
 game is that I do not know why we're going to 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.450
 lying is not a great game it 's fine 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.270
 but as if to pass the time, I do not eat 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.130
 example the one and you will tell me burgo one 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.900
 if you are sure that everyone who 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.180
 has tested 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.970
 that has started to play to play is 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.390
 some no goat doubt that is the 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:58.470
 Best of all this as I said before the 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.120
 that the most cured maybe the movement to 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.760
 As time has gone by 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:07.380
 obviously the gameplay has been 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:09.300
 much improved but if here maybe a 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.100
 Deadlock is not the best example of 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.740
 what I 'm going to tell you now I do not know the 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.570
 setting for me the setting 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:20.850
 of something one is the best of all because 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:24.050
 it was like more terrifying it was darker 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.600
 it was a game I do not know 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:30.050
 the logos had to be scary and I think 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:33.590
 that maybe it was not scary but they were 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:36.650
 he was not scared a little 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:40.760
 it was not that day a locus did not give 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.350
 that feeling that it is a 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.850
 creatures that come to kill the race 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.690
 human and you and they believed you 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:50.990
 I do not know the terrifying thing and that made to measure 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.760
 that have been happening the videogames 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.640
 as they have been taking out videogames 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.410
 of go has been lost and above all 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.970
 in the yacht men that I think everyone 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.430
 We agree that it is neither 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.230
 they know the crazy ones like in the 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.470
 multiplayer is the one that we are going to tell 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.600
 that you do not know already but it's gone 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:12.080
 losing that aura of fear like that 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:15.440
 no longer terror nothing is not so dark the 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:18.350
 I do not know how to see clearly until the 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.640
 graphics about ores but is that if not 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.790
 were better than we would be talking 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.160
 still make the game worse, you know that 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.250
 if it does not exceed 1 that came out very much 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.390
 before turn off and let's go you know is that 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.900
 it can be 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.459
 and nothing is equal to the gameplay also 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.580
 it has been improved and for example I 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:39.950
 I admit that I do not play something 12 that 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.660
 I started at 3 or whether I'm not the 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.360
 to start at level 1 level 2 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.450
 imagine and I started in 3 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.400
 but I recognize that it is a great game and 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.130
 following the games because I get 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.160
 very nervous when because it moves 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.440
 much slower is a game that is more 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.310
 difficult to play then those who 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.989
 you do not know those who are looking for challenges 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:06.530
 both with weapons dominated the weapons 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:08.690
 or learn to use the sniper or the 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.760
 different weapons of the game the bow the 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.690
 different weapons of the game is much more 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:18.019
 difficult that the current ones the current 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:20.600
 In fact, my 8-year-old cousin would be 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.650
 able to make a mocha you know what 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.080
 I want to tell you 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.810
 however in these games it's not much 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.480
 harder I think about the one do it myself 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.210
 in fact in 1 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:35.780
 because I can not I can not 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.370
 and that does not defend that I would like 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:42.110
 know what do you think of 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:45.259
 something 1 if you play something 1 if you prefer me 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.150
 I know which one you prefer from the 4 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:52.160
 what do you think 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:54.009
 although not all of us have the same idea of 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:58.559
 about the yacht men 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:05:01.330
 and given also I wanted to tell you that 

00:04:58.559 --> 00:05:03.759
 about questions and answers that many 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.820
 questions that when it's going to come out also 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:10.470
 I give all 'five when it's going to come out 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:13.360
 questions and answers you will see is that 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:16.750
 we want to do it well then we want 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.569
 do it with a good camera because if 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.429
 you do not know 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:22.420
 the one in charge of asking questions and 

00:05:20.429 --> 00:05:25.510
 answers will be flex 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:28.420
 then flex we are waiting for 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.800
 can have the camera they will leave a 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:33.910
 camera and we're waiting for it to be 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:36.670
 leave a good camera with quality and 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:38.800
 we want it to be bad what 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:41.470
 best possible then the moment in the 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.000
 you have choice you have available to them 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:48.920
 from that camera you can already 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.639
 already we will upload it later regarding the 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.830
 top five 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:54.990
 we are also waiting because we have 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.280

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:05.230
 in the design of introductions to 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.650
 clips and such also that it is very very 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:08.770
