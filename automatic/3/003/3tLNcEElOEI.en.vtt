00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:12.150
 Now this is a nice one, 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:12.940
 MIC 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.159
 In fact, this model has a higher average than it 

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:19.840
 It looks like an apartment. 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.840
 Because it has almost the same functionality, I use this model 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:25.779
 I'll give you a chemical explanation. 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.249
 Maybe this is the case, 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:32.249
 I will be a model that has a lot in overseas. 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.720
 Aggravation is also the evil is then 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.720
 I'll assemble it. 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.780
 divorce 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.219
 If it's a model, take it like this. It's not a scandal. 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.429
 Such a control that has a good eye for my child 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:57.060
 I will become a Duksan stand. 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.089
 To some extent 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:00.350
 Father 50 70% 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.370
 I will do this now 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.560
 In the second model of fishing vessels, there is also business expansion 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.690
 And ij think that's a bit unusual 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.070
 i run shape 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.580
 There is that shock route. 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.390
 Ashok Marketing 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.300
 It is now either the desk move that we had, 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.950
 I have the color and this time 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.080
 If you are a doctor or a father, 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.340
 again 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.670
 i got through micro stand-up 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.050
 So what can stop that control now 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.470
 Would you be in trouble 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.570
 This candidate is mainly made up of the factory in Ganghwa. 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.330
 have 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.330
 How to summon a summoned recipe 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:51.340
 Structure 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.550
 Moving apart 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.550
 It is in Vyromed. 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.310
 I organize this once in a row against ships. 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.500
 In this way 

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:20.059
 You are doing this request 

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:27.930
 If current 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.099
 I have a part of it 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.099
 You can reconfigure this to 0. 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:34.159
 10 40 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:36.079
 Composed of 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:39.089
 Then you will have free summer clothes. 

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:40.759
 In a relaxed manner 

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:42.869
 Hey Mike 

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:43.770
 Billion 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.719
 Likewise, in the second set, 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:49.589
 Toward the front 

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:53.269
 So that you can come out in the direction of this money 

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:55.549
 Or not. 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:57.249
 And then the next 

00:02:57.249 --> 00:02:58.200
 i 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.009
 Then the researcher 

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:02.239
 If you call me that, 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.729
 It will be fixed 

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:07.639
 Why am I corrected? 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:10.769
 This is the way it is now. 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.709
 That's the first line. 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.109
 Now it's moving 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:19.109
 I do not have a good fix. 

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:21.319
 And 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:22.840
 Now here, 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.840
 I will install gold data. 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:29.379
 It looks like an apartment complex. 

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:33.029
 The glass also has the ring like this 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:36.429
 none 

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:38.019
 In particular, 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.540
 Behind this 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.319
 By connecting 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.809
 Led 

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:48.809
 I will watch the return, etc. 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:54.889
 Durability to the extent that the Japanese government does not 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:55.989
 I will. 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.069
 Then 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:00.489
 I have to rebuke 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.269
 i 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.379
 Boryeong Seo 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:07.809
 To dj microphone terminal 

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:10.809
 Mike, who showed me a book called "Irony" 

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:12.240
 Unlike muscle stand 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.820
 The disadvantage is that the escape is higher 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.359
 I can not cast 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.370
 I am so sad that I am easily injured. 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.249
 I will become such a structure. 

00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:25.520
 And 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.669
 Baby 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:27.919
 The filter 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:29.169
 In this way 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:30.969
 Today ahead 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:32.419
 That 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:35.810
 As I told you, you can use a wave filter 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:36.949
 To install 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:40.869
 If you do this, 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:44.930
 It's over now. 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.930
 this 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:51.270
 As usual usb 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.880
 Let's connect the table to the computer. 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.210
 Here too, there is a thin part and the gainer part 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.669
 Parents have a hard time. 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:04.210
 At 800 won 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:05.930
 it might 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.770
 I'll connect. 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.840
 If you look at Might Up and Part 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.220
 It's open to the public 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.059
 Improved safety terminal 

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:18.059
 Maybe it's too much to push it like this. 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.589
 And 

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:24.409
 Likewise, 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:27.299
 usb terminal a 

00:05:27.299 --> 00:05:30.050
 Let's compare the percentages. 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.550
 However, 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.550
 Difficult and right foot 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:41.470
 my treat inside 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.660
 Once limited, 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.800
 If you guarantee Park 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.629
 I will. 

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:48.919
 So now in this state 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:50.659
 In front of the non-evil subject 

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:53.050
 If you do the southeast 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.050
 You can hansome 

00:05:56.619 --> 00:05:58.539
 i 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:00.719
 That 

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:01.979
 From infrastructure 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:03.529
 Mike and I 

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:05.050
 From the beginning of life 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.050
 Maybe it's actually crude oil 

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:11.009
 Installation for michael 

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:13.909
 Maybe I'll finish the installation process. 

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:17.539
 Maybe at the end of the race, 

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:21.680
 On the day that Anti comes out of the presidential election 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.550
 I guess it would be a shame to get in touch with the dot. 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.659
 I mentioned earlier 

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:33.159
 If he writes, he is probably a Korean 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.309
 That's what happened to you. 

00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:38.419
 Well, there's a pros and cons for each other. 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:41.270
 Personal thoughts are the most problematic 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.380
 And that's the advantage of Mike 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:45.619
 Get a walk. 

00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:48.810
 I've seen him in real time 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.310
 41 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.889
 You can listen to your voice while listening to it. 

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:54.510
 Can 

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:56.449
 I do not think that's the case. 

00:06:56.449 --> 00:07:00.379
 And now this mic does not have contact 

00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:02.169
 You can not monitor 

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:04.460
 So, 

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:05.779
 Meantime 

00:07:05.779 --> 00:07:08.130
 Because it is so clear 

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:11.140
 I think this is a very good word. 

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:14.210
 So perhaps now 

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:17.210
 In addition to Michael's domestic time, 

00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:20.490
 Because of upis 

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.549
 The choice of the problem 

00:07:23.549 --> 00:07:25.310
 Lovers from 

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:26.080
 I'll do it.
