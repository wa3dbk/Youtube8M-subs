you can get your crescent wrench be sure

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.580 
you can get your crescent wrench be sure
we<00:01:57.509> screw<00:01:57.869> righty<00:01:58.140> tighty<00:02:00.110> so<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.200> last<00:02:01.380> piece

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
we screw righty tighty so the last piece

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.319 
we screw righty tighty so the last piece
you're<00:02:01.770> gonna<00:02:01.860> need<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.310> your<00:02:02.640> end<00:02:02.820> cap<00:02:03.030> for

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
you're gonna need is your end cap for

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.060 
you're gonna need is your end cap for
the<00:02:03.390> cutting<00:02:03.630> board<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.930> go<00:02:04.020> back<00:02:04.229> in<00:02:04.380> place<00:02:04.619> so

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
the cutting board to go back in place so

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.679 
the cutting board to go back in place so
your<00:02:05.189> pusher<00:02:05.430> block<00:02:05.640> doesn't<00:02:05.939> come<00:02:06.180> off<00:02:06.329> it's

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
your pusher block doesn't come off it's

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.650 
your pusher block doesn't come off it's
pretty<00:02:06.750> easy<00:02:07.049> it<00:02:07.710> only<00:02:07.860> goes<00:02:08.069> in<00:02:08.220> one<00:02:08.250> way

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
pretty easy it only goes in one way

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.170 
pretty easy it only goes in one way
and<00:02:10.190> that's<00:02:11.190> how<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.400> replace<00:02:11.730> your<00:02:11.940> blade

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
and that's how you replace your blade
