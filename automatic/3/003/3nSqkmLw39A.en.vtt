00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.020 
going back you can actually show that
analytically<00:02:40.709> in<00:02:40.859> a<00:02:40.950> MOSFET<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.609> best<00:02:41.819> thing

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
analytically in a MOSFET the best thing

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.569 
analytically in a MOSFET the best thing
you<00:02:42.180> can<00:02:42.329> achieve<00:02:42.450> is<00:02:42.870> 60ml<00:02:43.769> actual<00:02:44.099> volt<00:02:44.310> per

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
you can achieve is 60ml actual volt per

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.970 
you can achieve is 60ml actual volt per
decade<00:02:44.939> because<00:02:45.510> it<00:02:45.840> really<00:02:46.139> has<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.500> do<00:02:46.680> with

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
decade because it really has to do with

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.360

devices<00:04:31.580> so<00:04:32.580> now<00:04:32.900> let's<00:04:33.900> look<00:04:34.200> at<00:04:35.000> a<00:04:36.000> device

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
devices so now let's look at a device

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.230 
devices so now let's look at a device
structure<00:04:37.710> where<00:04:37.980> we<00:04:38.280> don't<00:04:38.550> need<00:04:38.730> phonons

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
structure where we don't need phonons

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.700 
structure where we don't need phonons
because<00:04:42.240> if<00:04:42.450> you<00:04:42.570> did<00:04:42.780> this<00:04:42.900> in<00:04:43.080> silicon<00:04:43.590> this

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
because if you did this in silicon this

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.440 
because if you did this in silicon this
band<00:04:43.950> to<00:04:44.100> band<00:04:44.220> tunneling<00:04:44.730> you<00:04:44.850> went<00:04:45.090> from<00:04:45.300> a

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
band to band tunneling you went from a

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.410 
band to band tunneling you went from a
direct<00:04:45.920> gamma<00:04:46.920> point<00:04:47.340> to<00:04:47.670> an<00:04:47.790> indirect<00:04:48.180> X

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
direct gamma point to an indirect X

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.620 
direct gamma point to an indirect X
point<00:04:48.720> you<00:04:48.930> will<00:04:49.080> need<00:04:49.110> phonons<00:04:49.860> to<00:04:50.160> take<00:04:50.370> you

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
point you will need phonons to take you

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.620 
point you will need phonons to take you
properly<00:04:51.630> from<00:04:52.140> one<00:04:52.380> band<00:04:52.560> to<00:04:52.980> the<00:04:53.100> next<00:04:53.630> but

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
properly from one band to the next but

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.750 
properly from one band to the next but
if<00:04:54.720> you<00:04:54.840> have<00:04:54.930> a<00:04:54.960> direct<00:04:55.320> gap<00:04:55.530> material<00:04:56.130> like

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
if you have a direct gap material like

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.320 
if you have a direct gap material like
indium<00:04:57.240> arsenide<00:04:57.440> you<00:04:58.440> don't<00:04:58.650> need<00:04:58.830> photons

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
indium arsenide you don't need photons

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.940 
indium arsenide you don't need photons
so<00:05:00.330> let's<00:05:00.540> study<00:05:00.750> cases<00:05:01.260> first<00:05:01.710> where<00:05:01.920> we

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
so let's study cases first where we

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.600 
so let's study cases first where we
don't<00:05:02.190> need<00:05:02.340> phonons

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
don't need phonons

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.400 
don't need phonons
so<00:05:05.610> in<00:05:06.240> indium<00:05:06.630> arsenide<00:05:06.750> we<00:05:07.080> don't<00:05:07.290> need

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
so in indium arsenide we don't need

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.920 
so in indium arsenide we don't need
phonons<00:05:07.890> and<00:05:08.130> it's<00:05:08.610> a<00:05:08.760> but<00:05:09.240> we<00:05:09.360> also<00:05:09.540> know<00:05:09.900> that

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
phonons and it's a but we also know that

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.990

it's<00:05:10.260> a<00:05:10.380> highly<00:05:10.650> non<00:05:10.950> parabolic<00:05:11.550> conduction

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
it's a highly non parabolic conduction

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.920 
it's a highly non parabolic conduction
band<00:05:12.210> and<00:05:13.790> we<00:05:14.790> know<00:05:15.120> that<00:05:15.360> we<00:05:15.480> also<00:05:15.690> need

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.040

realistic<00:05:16.470> valence<00:05:16.860> band<00:05:17.070> features<00:05:18.020> so<00:05:19.020> we

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
lectures I had shown briefly on how to

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.380 
lectures I had shown briefly on how to
construct<00:05:38.910> a<00:05:39.240> dispersion<00:05:40.230> of<00:05:40.560> a<00:05:40.680> nano<00:05:40.919> wire

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:41.390

for<00:05:42.390> the<00:05:42.480> conduction<00:05:42.840> band<00:05:43.110> it's<00:05:43.260> pretty<00:05:43.530> easy

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
for the conduction band it's pretty easy

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.210 
for the conduction band it's pretty easy
basically<00:05:44.190> have<00:05:44.370> two<00:05:44.700> modes<00:05:45.000> that<00:05:45.660> exist<00:05:46.220> in

basically have two modes that exist in

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.480 
basically have two modes that exist in
this<00:05:47.640> five<00:05:47.940> nanometer<00:05:48.740> quantum<00:05:49.740> well<00:05:49.890> so<00:05:50.430> to

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.490 
this five nanometer quantum well so to

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.240 
this five nanometer quantum well so to
speak<00:05:50.820> is<00:05:51.180> a<00:05:51.210> ground<00:05:52.110> state<00:05:52.410> and<00:05:52.590> an<00:05:52.710> excited

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
speak is a ground state and an excited

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.370 
speak is a ground state and an excited
state<00:05:53.280> so<00:05:53.910> to<00:05:53.970> speak<00:05:54.330> but<00:05:54.840> it<00:05:54.990> has<00:05:55.140> now<00:05:55.350> a

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380

propagation<00:05:56.540> property<00:05:57.540> it<00:05:57.720> has<00:05:57.990> a<00:05:58.020> dispersion

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530 
propagation property it has a dispersion

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.890 
propagation property it has a dispersion
and<00:05:58.830> the<00:05:59.430> holes<00:05:59.669> look<00:06:00.120> rather<00:06:00.540> more

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
and the holes look rather more

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.110 
and the holes look rather more
complicated

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 
complicated

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.790

so<00:06:03.120> that<00:06:04.020> is<00:06:04.320> resembling<00:06:04.919> of<00:06:05.100> the<00:06:05.250> whole

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 
so that is resembling of the whole

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.140 
so that is resembling of the whole
dispersion<00:06:07.800> we<00:06:07.919> discussed<00:06:08.370> in<00:06:08.669> the<00:06:08.850> whole

transport<00:06:09.919> lecture<00:06:11.750> now<00:06:13.100> there<00:06:14.100> is<00:06:14.190> this<00:06:14.310> K

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.610 
transport lecture now there is this K

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.570 
transport lecture now there is this K
dependence<00:06:15.210> and<00:06:15.480> if<00:06:15.900> you<00:06:16.140> try<00:06:16.890> to<00:06:16.919> see<00:06:17.370> how

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
dependence and if you try to see how

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.820 
dependence and if you try to see how
these<00:06:17.760> band<00:06:18.150> edges<00:06:18.480> that<00:06:18.960> are<00:06:19.110> shown<00:06:19.350> in<00:06:19.590> blue

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 
these band edges that are shown in blue

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.750 
these band edges that are shown in blue
move<00:06:20.669> as<00:06:21.030> a<00:06:21.630> function<00:06:22.140> of<00:06:22.200> momentum<00:06:22.740> so<00:06:22.950> we<00:06:23.460> can

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:23.760 
move as a function of momentum so we can

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.230 
move as a function of momentum so we can
turn<00:06:24.030> the<00:06:24.150> momentum<00:06:24.300> lose<00:06:25.310> the<00:06:26.310> Veil<00:06:27.000> the

turn the momentum lose the Veil the

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.880 
turn the momentum lose the Veil the
conduction<00:06:27.630> band<00:06:27.930> edge<00:06:28.169> moves<00:06:28.560> rather

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:28.890 
conduction band edge moves rather

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:31.450 
conduction band edge moves rather
rapidly<00:06:29.430> because<00:06:30.270> it<00:06:30.390> has<00:06:30.510> a<00:06:30.540> high<00:06:30.780> slope<00:06:31.169> and

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:31.460 
rapidly because it has a high slope and

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.880 
rapidly because it has a high slope and
the<00:06:32.460> dispersion<00:06:33.390> of<00:06:33.690> the<00:06:33.930> holes<00:06:34.169> is<00:06:34.500> much

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:34.890 
the dispersion of the holes is much

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:36.920 
the dispersion of the holes is much
weaker<00:06:35.190> depending<00:06:35.970> on<00:06:36.060> K<00:06:36.270> it's<00:06:36.450> much<00:06:36.660> heavier

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:36.930 
weaker depending on K it's much heavier

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.070 
weaker depending on K it's much heavier
it<00:06:37.440> does<00:06:37.680> move<00:06:37.950> a<00:06:38.070> whole<00:06:38.190> lot<00:06:38.250> and<00:06:39.050> shown<00:06:40.050> in

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 
it does move a whole lot and shown in

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.510 
it does move a whole lot and shown in
the<00:06:40.350> center<00:06:40.800> the

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 
the center the

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.339 
the center the
is<00:06:41.610> the<00:06:41.819> transmission<00:06:42.509> coefficient<00:06:42.690> through

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:43.349 
is the transmission coefficient through

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:46.580 
is the transmission coefficient through
the<00:06:43.500> structure<00:06:43.979> so<00:06:44.310> as<00:06:44.550> you<00:06:44.759> ramp<00:06:45.000> up<00:06:45.180> K<00:06:45.590> you

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:46.590 
the structure so as you ramp up K you

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.839 
the structure so as you ramp up K you
kind<00:06:46.800> of<00:06:46.860> shut<00:06:47.160> off<00:06:47.340> the<00:06:47.729> device<00:06:49.250> okay<00:06:50.250> so<00:06:50.310> here

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:50.849 
kind of shut off the device okay so here

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:52.640 
kind of shut off the device okay so here
at<00:06:50.940> K<00:06:51.120> equals<00:06:51.150> zero<00:06:51.569> you<00:06:51.810> run<00:06:52.020> through<00:06:52.289> fine

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:52.650 
at K equals zero you run through fine

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:56.300 
at K equals zero you run through fine
and<00:06:52.949> a<00:06:53.849> cake<00:06:54.120> will<00:06:54.389> a<00:06:54.750> large<00:06:55.319> number<00:06:55.650> zero

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:56.310 
and a cake will a large number zero

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.790 
and a cake will a large number zero
point<00:06:56.639> three<00:06:57.270> five<00:06:57.509> point<00:06:57.990> four<00:06:58.259> you

00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 
point three five point four you

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.490 
point three five point four you
basically<00:06:59.069> have<00:06:59.220> to<00:06:59.340> shut<00:06:59.550> off<00:06:59.580> the<00:06:59.699> channel

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:00.500 
basically have to shut off the channel

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.469 
basically have to shut off the channel
so<00:07:01.500> you<00:07:01.530> will<00:07:01.860> have<00:07:02.039> a<00:07:02.099> channel<00:07:02.520> that<00:07:03.360> is

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:03.479 
so you will have a channel that is

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:06.649 
so you will have a channel that is
momentum<00:07:04.050> dependent<00:07:04.669> and<00:07:05.669> of<00:07:05.819> course<00:07:06.090> voltage

00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:06.659 
momentum dependent and of course voltage

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:08.360 
momentum dependent and of course voltage
dependent<00:07:07.229> on<00:07:07.349> what<00:07:07.500> kind<00:07:07.710> of<00:07:07.800> voltage<00:07:07.979> you

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:08.370 
dependent on what kind of voltage you

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:10.790 
dependent on what kind of voltage you
drop<00:07:08.639> here<00:07:08.849> so<00:07:09.060> you<00:07:09.150> must<00:07:09.539> do<00:07:09.930> energy<00:07:10.259> and

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:10.800 
drop here so you must do energy and

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.580 
drop here so you must do energy and
momentum<00:07:11.270> integration<00:07:12.270> properly<00:07:12.840> to<00:07:13.409> do

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:13.590 
momentum integration properly to do

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:18.529 
momentum integration properly to do
transport<00:07:14.400> here<00:07:16.250> so<00:07:17.250> now<00:07:17.460> let's<00:07:17.699> consider<00:07:18.030> a

00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:18.539 
transport here so now let's consider a

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:21.980 
transport here so now let's consider a
realistic<00:07:19.229> structure<00:07:20.599> where<00:07:21.599> we<00:07:21.630> might<00:07:21.870> look

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:21.990 
realistic structure where we might look

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:23.990 
realistic structure where we might look

00:07:26.149 --> 00:07:26.159 
nanometer indium arsenide quantum well

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:31.700 
nanometer indium arsenide quantum well
it<00:07:26.880> sits<00:07:27.210> on<00:07:27.300> a<00:07:27.360> substrate<00:07:28.759> and<00:07:30.530> let's<00:07:31.530> look

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:31.710 
it sits on a substrate and let's look

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:34.459 
it sits on a substrate and let's look
how<00:07:31.889> the<00:07:31.949> bands<00:07:32.250> would<00:07:32.550> look<00:07:32.729> like<00:07:33.080> so<00:07:34.080> here<00:07:34.380> is

00:07:34.459 --> 00:07:34.469 
how the bands would look like so here is

00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:36.950 
how the bands would look like so here is
the<00:07:34.620> band<00:07:34.860> edge<00:07:35.099> diagram<00:07:35.699> and<00:07:36.000> we<00:07:36.330> compute<00:07:36.870> a

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:36.960 
the band edge diagram and we compute a

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.580 
the band edge diagram and we compute a
realistic<00:07:37.440> force<00:07:37.710> on<00:07:37.919> solution<00:07:38.520> in<00:07:38.729> 3d<00:07:39.590> where

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:40.590 
realistic force on solution in 3d where

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:43.189 
realistic force on solution in 3d where
the<00:07:40.680> doping<00:07:41.129> is<00:07:41.310> 10<00:07:42.090> to<00:07:42.240> the<00:07:42.270> 18<00:07:42.780> in<00:07:43.080> the

00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:43.199 
the doping is 10 to the 18 in the

00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:46.189 
the doping is 10 to the 18 in the
contacts<00:07:43.860> and<00:07:44.729> you<00:07:45.389> basically<00:07:45.719> see<00:07:45.990> as<00:07:46.080> a

00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:46.199 
contacts and you basically see as a

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:49.279 
contacts and you basically see as a
function<00:07:46.530> of<00:07:46.590> gate<00:07:46.830> voltage<00:07:47.340> how<00:07:47.969> the<00:07:48.870> bands

00:07:49.279 --> 00:07:49.289 
function of gate voltage how the bands

00:07:49.289 --> 00:07:51.110 
function of gate voltage how the bands
are<00:07:49.469> controlled<00:07:50.069> in<00:07:50.400> the<00:07:50.550> center<00:07:50.849> of<00:07:50.969> the

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120 
are controlled in the center of the

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.600 
are controlled in the center of the
device<00:07:51.240> and<00:07:51.750> you<00:07:51.810> also<00:07:52.650> see<00:07:53.039> that<00:07:53.280> there<00:07:53.490> is<00:07:53.520> a

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:53.610 
device and you also see that there is a

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:56.390 
device and you also see that there is a
significant<00:07:54.389> slope<00:07:54.719> still<00:07:55.139> here<00:07:55.530> in<00:07:55.710> the

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400 
significant slope still here in the

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.309 
significant slope still here in the
center<00:07:56.789> of<00:07:56.909> the<00:07:57.090> device<00:07:57.389> except<00:07:57.870> for<00:07:58.050> the<00:07:58.110> very

00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 
center of the device except for the very

00:07:58.319 --> 00:08:00.350 
center of the device except for the very
high<00:07:58.380> gate<00:07:58.860> biases<00:07:59.460> but<00:07:59.699> there's<00:07:59.909> a<00:08:00.000> strong

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:00.360 
high gate biases but there's a strong

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:04.849 
high gate biases but there's a strong
slope<00:08:01.610> all<00:08:02.610> right
