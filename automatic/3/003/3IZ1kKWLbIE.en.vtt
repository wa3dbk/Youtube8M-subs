indifferent<00:05:24.870> this<00:05:25.530> because<00:05:25.800> I<00:05:25.860> don't<00:05:25.919> have

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:26.099 
indifferent this because I don't have

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:28.760 
indifferent this because I don't have
enough<00:05:26.160> information<00:05:26.940> on<00:05:27.389> lattes<00:05:27.960> I<00:05:28.319> haven't

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
enough information on lattes I haven't

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.300 
enough information on lattes I haven't
tried<00:05:28.949> a<00:05:29.009> whole<00:05:29.190> lot<00:05:29.400> of<00:05:29.430> lattes<00:05:30.889> some<00:05:31.889> lattes

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
tried a whole lot of lattes some lattes

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.610 
tried a whole lot of lattes some lattes
I<00:05:32.460> bet<00:05:32.639> are<00:05:32.849> not<00:05:33.360> as<00:05:33.539> strong<00:05:33.840> as<00:05:33.870> other<00:05:34.169> lattes

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
I bet are not as strong as other lattes

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.779 
I bet are not as strong as other lattes
and<00:05:34.830> it<00:05:34.919> depends<00:05:35.250> on<00:05:35.370> there's<00:05:35.729> also<00:05:36.300> human

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:37.789 
and it depends on there's also human

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:40.490 
and it depends on there's also human
creativity<00:05:38.789> I<00:05:39.030> guess<00:05:39.419> when<00:05:39.960> they<00:05:40.080> make<00:05:40.289> these

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
creativity I guess when they make these

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.050 
creativity I guess when they make these
you<00:05:41.160> could<00:05:41.280> probably<00:05:41.490> come<00:05:41.759> here<00:05:41.940> in<00:05:42.000> a

a little bit different but they should

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.379 
a little bit different but they should
