00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
like hard covers that initially I'll I

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.299

started out with a ring binder from
Walmart<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:56.940> covers<00:00:57.390> similar<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.870> these<00:00:58.050> and

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
Walmart that covers similar to these and

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.590 
Walmart that covers similar to these and

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
it came with a ring the perfect size you

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.680 
it came with a ring the perfect size you
just<00:01:00.960> take<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.199> paper<00:01:01.410> out<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:02.510> replace<00:01:03.510> it

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
just take the paper out and replace it

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.690 
just take the paper out and replace it
with<00:01:03.719> your<00:01:03.840> own<00:01:05.510> the<00:01:06.510> next<00:01:06.900> step<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:07.860> guess<00:01:08.100> is

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
with your own the next step I guess is

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.340 
with your own the next step I guess is
for<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.030> inner<00:01:09.210> pages<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.720> lot<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:09.990> times<00:01:10.170> but

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
for the inner pages a lot of times but

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.810 
for the inner pages a lot of times but
the<00:01:10.439> outer<00:01:10.590> pages<00:01:11.040> I'll<00:01:11.130> use<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.280> cover<00:01:11.610> like

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
the outer pages I'll use a cover like

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.750 
the outer pages I'll use a cover like
this<00:01:12.090> for<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.930> inner<00:01:13.110> pages<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:14.220> material

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
this for the inner pages the material

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.880 
this for the inner pages the material
will<00:01:14.880> actually<00:01:15.150> be<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.479> pizza<00:01:15.780> box<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.560> cut<00:01:16.770> it

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
will actually be a pizza box you cut it

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.800 
will actually be a pizza box you cut it
out<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.280> then<00:01:17.729> spray<00:01:18.000> paint<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.330> black<00:01:18.540> around

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
out and then spray paint it black around

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.350 
out and then spray paint it black around
the<00:01:18.900> edges<00:01:19.140> or<00:01:19.290> leave<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:20.009> it's<00:01:20.939> up<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.210> you

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
the edges or leave it it's up to you

Papa John's a little bit thicker than
Little<00:01:23.640> Caesars<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.960> can<00:01:25.110> four<00:01:25.770> different

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
sizes of binders different number of

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.240 
sizes of binders different number of
pages<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:28.110> know<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.320> choose<00:01:28.680> whichever<00:01:29.040> one

you<00:01:29.369> like<00:01:29.520> if<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.240> want<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.450> go<00:01:30.540> one<00:01:30.750> level<00:01:30.780> up

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
you like if you want to go one level up

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.830 
you like if you want to go one level up
I<00:01:31.500> went<00:01:32.220> puro<00:01:32.759> Plast<00:01:33.090> it's<00:01:33.570> about<00:01:33.689> the

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
I went puro Plast it's about the

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.600 
I went puro Plast it's about the
thickness<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.320> or<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.280> can<00:01:35.369> get<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.520> at

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
thickness of or you can get it at

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.950 
thickness of or you can get it at
different<00:01:35.880> sizes<00:01:36.240> but<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.420> got<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.810> the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
different sizes but I got it the

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.620 
different sizes but I got it the
thickness<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.530> Little<00:01:37.710> Caesars<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.630> it

thickness of the Little Caesars and it

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.240 
thickness of the Little Caesars and it
just<00:01:39.869> takes<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.439> view<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.740> saves<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.130> the

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
just takes a view that saves you the

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.789 
just takes a view that saves you the
step<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.780> doing<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.960> spray<00:01:43.170> paint<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.649> stuff

step of doing the spray paint and stuff

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.090 
step of doing the spray paint and stuff
like<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.509> anyway<00:01:45.560> putting<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.680> together<00:01:46.799> is

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
like that anyway putting it together is

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.310 
like that anyway putting it together is
pretty<00:01:47.280> straightforward<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:48.540> holes<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:49.140> used

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
pretty straightforward the holes I used

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.460 
pretty straightforward the holes I used
a<00:01:49.530> leather<00:01:50.070> punch<00:01:50.659> you<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.689> can't<00:01:52.140> remember<00:01:52.290> off

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
a leather punch you I can't remember off

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.679 
a leather punch you I can't remember off
the<00:01:52.500> top<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.680> my<00:01:52.770> head<00:01:52.950> which<00:01:53.130> size<00:01:53.430> I<00:01:53.759> did<00:01:54.000> but

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
the top of my head which size I did but

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.139 
the top of my head which size I did but
uh<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:55.229> have<00:01:55.829> here<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.579> was<00:01:56.700> one<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:56.939> these<00:01:57.000> I

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
uh I have here it was one of these I

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.840 
uh I have here it was one of these I
think<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.360> was<00:01:57.450> like<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:58.079> 5.2<00:01:58.799> but<00:01:59.640> I<00:01:59.670> have

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
think it was like the the 5.2 but I have

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.459 
think it was like the the 5.2 but I have
four<00:02:00.000> point<00:02:00.210> eight<00:02:00.360> through<00:02:00.719> eight<00:02:01.079> point

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
four point eight through eight point

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.380 
four point eight through eight point
eight<00:02:01.680> point<00:02:02.100> zero<00:02:02.189> millimeter<00:02:03.829> diameters

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
eight point zero millimeter diameters

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.449 
eight point zero millimeter diameters
anyway<00:02:06.420> I<00:02:06.600> mean<00:02:07.350> it'll<00:02:07.590> take<00:02:07.860> some<00:02:08.129> I<00:02:08.399> don't

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
anyway I mean it'll take some I don't

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.729 
anyway I mean it'll take some I don't
have<00:02:08.700> time<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.090> show<00:02:09.270> you<00:02:09.300> how<00:02:09.629> exactly<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.530> did

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
have time to show you how exactly I did

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.500 
have time to show you how exactly I did
it<00:02:10.830> but<00:02:11.069> it's<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:12.060> it's<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.480> very

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
it but it's a it's a very

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.790 
it but it's a it's a very
straightforward<00:02:13.140> process

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
straightforward process

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.410 
straightforward process
first<00:02:13.950> prototype<00:02:14.430> for<00:02:14.610> two<00:02:14.760> might<00:02:15.090> not<00:02:15.300> look

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
first prototype for two might not look

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.290 
first prototype for two might not look
that<00:02:15.480> great<00:02:15.780> but<00:02:15.920> after<00:02:16.920> one<00:02:17.070> or<00:02:17.100> two<00:02:17.220> like<00:02:17.550> ago

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
that great but after one or two like ago

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.450 
that great but after one or two like ago
you'll<00:02:18.480> get<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.720> hang<00:02:18.810> of<00:02:18.930> it<00:02:19.100> anyway<00:02:20.100> hope

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
you'll get the hang of it anyway hope

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.910 
you'll get the hang of it anyway hope
this<00:02:20.640> helps
