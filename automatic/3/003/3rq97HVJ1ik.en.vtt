what<00:00:01.660> you're<00:00:01.780> about<00:00:01.869> to<00:00:02.020> see<00:00:02.320> is<00:00:02.470> my<00:00:02.620> first

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:02.889 
what you're about to see is my first

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:04.680 
what you're about to see is my first
attempts<00:00:03.340> at<00:00:03.399> cutting<00:00:03.700> precision<00:00:03.940> patterns

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:04.690 
attempts at cutting precision patterns

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:06.659 
attempts at cutting precision patterns
using<00:00:04.930> a<00:00:05.080> nichrome<00:00:05.499> wire<00:00:05.529> cutter<00:00:06.069> the

00:00:06.659 --> 00:00:06.669 
using a nichrome wire cutter the

00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:08.400 
using a nichrome wire cutter the
motivation<00:00:07.120> behind<00:00:07.240> this<00:00:07.509> project<00:00:07.779> was<00:00:08.170> to<00:00:08.200> be

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:08.410 
motivation behind this project was to be

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.170 
motivation behind this project was to be
able<00:00:08.530> to<00:00:08.650> easily<00:00:08.889> cut<00:00:09.340> Plexiglas<00:00:09.940> in

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:10.180 
able to easily cut Plexiglas in

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.760 
able to easily cut Plexiglas in
different<00:00:10.600> shapes<00:00:10.840> for<00:00:10.960> use<00:00:11.290> in<00:00:11.440> different

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:11.770 
different shapes for use in different

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.200 
different shapes for use in different
projects<00:00:12.310> without<00:00:12.610> the<00:00:12.760> use<00:00:12.880> of<00:00:12.910> a<00:00:13.060> laser

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:13.210 
projects without the use of a laser

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.120 
projects without the use of a laser
cutter<00:00:13.600> therefore<00:00:14.380> some<00:00:14.560> plans<00:00:14.740> were<00:00:14.890> drawn

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:15.130 
cutter therefore some plans were drawn

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.439 
cutter therefore some plans were drawn
that<00:00:15.280> could<00:00:15.460> have<00:00:15.550> been<00:00:15.670> cut<00:00:15.850> using<00:00:16.209> laser

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:16.449 
that could have been cut using laser

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:18.269 
that could have been cut using laser
cutter<00:00:16.750> but<00:00:17.079> word<00:00:17.230> instead<00:00:17.619> cut<00:00:17.919> using<00:00:18.130> the

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:18.279 
cutter but word instead cut using the

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:22.259 
cutter but word instead cut using the
nichrome<00:00:18.730> wire<00:00:18.789> cutter<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:21.400> plastic<00:00:21.820> cut<00:00:21.999> was

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:22.269 
nichrome wire cutter the plastic cut was

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:24.060 
nichrome wire cutter the plastic cut was
either<00:00:22.419> three<00:00:22.869> thirty-seconds<00:00:23.619> of<00:00:23.739> an<00:00:23.859> inch

it<00:00:31.089> along<00:00:31.179> the<00:00:31.449> wire<00:00:31.630> so<00:00:31.899> that<00:00:31.929> the<00:00:32.050> hottest

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:32.470

the<00:01:37.079> thin<00:01:37.259> plexiglass<00:01:37.740> was<00:01:37.950> able<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.159> be<00:01:38.310> cut

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
the thin plexiglass was able to be cut

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.190 
the thin plexiglass was able to be cut
without<00:01:38.609> sliding<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.270> along<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.600> wire<00:01:39.750> making

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
without sliding it along the wire making

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.169 
without sliding it along the wire making
the<00:01:40.409> cutting<00:01:40.649> process<00:01:40.770> slower<00:01:41.340> but<00:01:41.880> cleaner

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:42.179 
the cutting process slower but cleaner

00:01:42.179 --> 00:02:43.680 
the cutting process slower but cleaner
and<00:01:42.329> more<00:01:42.450> accurate
