so<00:00:00.450> researchers<00:00:01.140> from<00:00:01.260> Stanford<00:00:01.350> University

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:01.740 
so researchers from Stanford University

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.370 
so researchers from Stanford University
are<00:00:02.520> trying<00:00:02.879> to<00:00:03.179> solve<00:00:03.540> the<00:00:03.929> age-old<00:00:03.959> question

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
are trying to solve the age-old question

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.880 
are trying to solve the age-old question
what<00:00:04.950> do<00:00:05.279> I<00:00:05.339> do<00:00:05.490> to<00:00:06.029> charge<00:00:06.299> my<00:00:06.540> phone<00:00:06.890> faster

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
what do I do to charge my phone faster

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.830 
what do I do to charge my phone faster
for<00:00:08.429> some<00:00:08.610> people<00:00:08.940> it<00:00:09.059> could<00:00:09.179> take<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.540> very

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
for some people it could take a very

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.600 
for some people it could take a very
long<00:00:10.019> time<00:00:10.349> to<00:00:10.469> charge<00:00:10.650> your<00:00:10.830> phone<00:00:10.889> hours<00:00:11.460> in

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
long time to charge your phone hours in

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.700 
long time to charge your phone hours in
some<00:00:11.759> cases<00:00:12.210> if<00:00:12.389> you<00:00:12.780> have<00:00:12.809> a<00:00:12.960> Samsung<00:00:13.200> like<00:00:13.530> me

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
some cases if you have a Samsung like me

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.200 
some cases if you have a Samsung like me
it<00:00:13.830> can<00:00:13.860> take<00:00:14.130> only<00:00:14.370> like<00:00:14.519> 30<00:00:14.730> minutes<00:00:15.089> which

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
it can take only like 30 minutes which

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.870 
it can take only like 30 minutes which
is<00:00:15.330> awesome<00:00:15.750> but<00:00:16.139> anyway<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:17.220> researchers<00:00:17.730> at

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
is awesome but anyway the researchers at

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.730 
is awesome but anyway the researchers at
Stanford<00:00:18.000> are<00:00:18.539> like<00:00:18.690> look<00:00:19.050> we<00:00:19.260> want<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.529> charge

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
Stanford are like look we want to charge

Stanford are like look we want to charge
our<00:00:19.920> batteries<00:00:19.949> in<00:00:20.580> like<00:00:20.880> 60<00:00:21.810> seconds<00:00:22.340> so<00:00:23.340> can

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
our batteries in like 60 seconds so can

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.700 
our batteries in like 60 seconds so can
they<00:00:23.730> do<00:00:23.789> it<00:00:24.119> let's<00:00:24.779> see<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:25.140> team<00:00:25.590> of

producing sufficient voltage about two

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.360 
producing sufficient voltage about two
volts<00:00:51.000> even<00:00:51.629> after<00:00:52.110> thousands<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.770> recharge

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
volts even after thousands of recharge

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.340 
volts even after thousands of recharge
cycle<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.270> last<00:00:54.750> part<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.170> really

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
cycle so that last part is really

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.830 
cycle so that last part is really
important<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.829> me<00:00:55.980> because<00:00:56.010> if<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:57.329> notice

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
important to me because if you notice

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.900 
important to me because if you notice
after<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.379> bunch<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.680> recharge<00:00:59.160> cycles<00:00:59.670> your

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
after a bunch of recharge cycles your

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.369 
after a bunch of recharge cycles your
phone<00:01:00.120> just<00:01:00.329> doesn't<00:01:00.600> charge<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.020> same<00:01:01.170> way

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
phone just doesn't charge the same way

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.410 
phone just doesn't charge the same way
anymore<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.859> either<00:01:01.980> takes<00:01:02.280> longer<00:01:02.850> or<00:01:03.270> the

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
anymore it either takes longer or the

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.359 
anymore it either takes longer or the
battery<00:01:03.780> still<00:01:04.110> drains<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.650> lot<00:01:04.680> faster<00:01:05.280> and

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
battery still drains a lot faster and

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.310 
battery still drains a lot faster and
it's<00:01:05.489> annoying<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:06.360> battery<00:01:06.659> can<00:01:06.869> recharge

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
it's annoying the battery can recharge

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.800 
it's annoying the battery can recharge
in<00:01:07.590> one<00:01:07.890> minute<00:01:08.340> it's<00:01:08.580> flexible<00:01:09.240> meaning<00:01:09.600> that

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
in one minute it's flexible meaning that

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.560 
in one minute it's flexible meaning that
it<00:01:09.900> could<00:01:10.049> be<00:01:10.200> bent<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.890> fit<00:01:11.430> more<00:01:11.580> snugly<00:01:11.700> into

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
it could be bent to fit more snugly into

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.080 
it could be bent to fit more snugly into
various<00:01:13.260> gadgets<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:14.070> it's<00:01:14.580> potentially

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
various gadgets and it's potentially

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.480 
various gadgets and it's potentially
inexpensive<00:01:15.810> since<00:01:16.080> aluminum<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:17.040> cheaper

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
inexpensive since aluminum is cheaper

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.990 
inexpensive since aluminum is cheaper

Stanford<00:01:34.079> they're<00:01:34.259> gonna<00:01:34.350> figure<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.619> out

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
Stanford they're gonna figure it out

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.260 
Stanford they're gonna figure it out
that's<00:01:35.189> what<00:01:35.369> they're<00:01:35.490> gonna<00:01:35.549> do<00:01:35.759> okay

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
that's what they're gonna do okay

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.510 
that's what they're gonna do okay
can<00:01:37.140> they<00:01:37.290> bring<00:01:37.530> people<00:01:37.560> back<00:01:37.950> from<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.340> dead

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
can they bring people back from the dead

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.719 
can they bring people back from the dead
at<00:01:38.700> Stanford<00:01:39.479> yes<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:40.320> answer<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.650> yes<00:01:40.890> okay

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
at Stanford yes the answer is yes okay

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.679 
at Stanford yes the answer is yes okay
so<00:01:42.240> it's<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.509> technology<00:01:43.079> issue<00:01:44.000> obviously<00:01:45.000> we

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
so it's a technology issue obviously we

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:46.880 
so it's a technology issue obviously we
just<00:01:45.899> keep<00:01:46.049> getting<00:01:46.290> better<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.530> better<00:01:46.740> and

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
just keep getting better and better and

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:47.810 
just keep getting better and better and
isn't<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.220> wonderful

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
isn't that wonderful

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.609 
isn't that wonderful
yeah<00:01:48.090> so<00:01:48.299> we<00:01:48.420> live<00:01:48.600> in<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.780> world<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.140> where<00:01:49.500> we

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
yeah so we live in a world that where we

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.889 
yeah so we live in a world that where we
assume<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:50.579> we're<00:01:51.149> gonna<00:01:51.270> figure<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.659> out

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
assume that we're gonna figure it out

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.469 
assume that we're gonna figure it out
and<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:53.159> technology's<00:01:53.700> gonna<00:01:53.850> continue<00:01:54.360> to

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
and that technology's gonna continue to

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.399 
and that technology's gonna continue to
improve<00:01:54.780> our<00:01:54.960> lives<00:01:55.219> so<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.250> mean<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:57.409> there's

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
improve our lives so I mean I there's

god<00:02:13.570> bless<00:02:14.020> science<00:02:14.680> yeah<00:02:15.130> it<00:02:15.280> does<00:02:15.460> feel<00:02:15.670> good

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
god bless science yeah it does feel good

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.190 
god bless science yeah it does feel good
to<00:02:15.880> be<00:02:15.970> on<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.210> right<00:02:16.330> side<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:16.660> also<00:02:16.780> there's

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
to be on the right side and also there's

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.990 
to be on the right side and also there's
nothing<00:02:17.530> more<00:02:17.710> annoying<00:02:18.010> than<00:02:18.640> your<00:02:18.760> phone

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
nothing more annoying than your phone

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000 
nothing more annoying than your phone
dying<00:02:19.270> and<00:02:19.600> then<00:02:19.840> having<00:02:20.170> to<00:02:20.320> charge<00:02:20.620> it<00:02:20.800> for<00:02:20.980> a

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
dying and then having to charge it for a

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.130 
dying and then having to charge it for a
really<00:02:21.190> long<00:02:21.400> time<00:02:21.700> so<00:02:22.270> knowing<00:02:22.780> that<00:02:23.020> this

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
really long time so knowing that this

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.560 
really long time so knowing that this
technology<00:02:23.560> is<00:02:23.830> on<00:02:24.100> its<00:02:24.280> way<00:02:24.370> puts<00:02:25.060> my<00:02:25.210> mind<00:02:25.240> at

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
technology is on its way puts my mind at

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.530 
technology is on its way puts my mind at
ease<00:02:25.660> but<00:02:26.140> I<00:02:26.200> have<00:02:26.380> to<00:02:26.530> say<00:02:26.740> I<00:02:27.070> mean<00:02:27.540> newer

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
ease but I have to say I mean newer

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.930 
ease but I have to say I mean newer
phones<00:02:29.020> are<00:02:29.440> getting<00:02:29.650> better<00:02:30.070> at<00:02:30.400> charging

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
phones are getting better at charging

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.660 
phones are getting better at charging
faster<00:02:31.480> so<00:02:31.720> is<00:02:31.900> this<00:02:32.080> feasible<00:02:32.590> absolutely<00:02:33.460> I

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
faster so is this feasible absolutely I

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:34.740 
faster so is this feasible absolutely I
don't<00:02:33.970> know<00:02:34.120> how<00:02:34.210> long<00:02:34.360> it's<00:02:34.540> going<00:02:34.630> to<00:02:34.690> take

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
don't know how long it's going to take

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.060 
don't know how long it's going to take
for<00:02:35.020> this<00:02:35.110> to<00:02:35.230> actually<00:02:35.350> be<00:02:35.680> out<00:02:35.710> in<00:02:35.980> the

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
for this to actually be out in the

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.470 
for this to actually be out in the
market<00:02:36.430> again<00:02:36.670> this<00:02:36.820> is<00:02:36.970> just<00:02:37.090> a<00:02:37.210> prototype

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
market again this is just a prototype

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.320 
market again this is just a prototype
but<00:02:38.380> it<00:02:38.710> seems<00:02:39.070> like<00:02:39.460> good<00:02:39.640> news<00:02:39.880> and

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
but it seems like good news and

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.910 
but it seems like good news and
hopefully<00:02:40.840> we<00:02:41.020> can<00:02:41.170> take<00:02:41.260> advantage<00:02:41.410> of<00:02:41.800> it

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
hopefully we can take advantage of it

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.400 
hopefully we can take advantage of it
very<00:02:42.100> soon
