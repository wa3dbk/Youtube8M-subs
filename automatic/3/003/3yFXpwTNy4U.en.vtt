yellow<00:02:35.629> because<00:02:35.900> irk<00:02:36.230> sees<00:02:36.439> deep<00:02:36.769> red<00:02:37.099> and

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340

really bright colorations because

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.170 
really bright colorations because
they're<00:02:42.439> both<00:02:42.650> so<00:02:42.890> saturated<00:02:43.579> in<00:02:43.670> color<00:02:43.700> and
