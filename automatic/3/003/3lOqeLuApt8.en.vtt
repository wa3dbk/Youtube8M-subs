built-in<00:00:03.240> in<00:00:03.510> the<00:00:03.810> RCA<00:00:04.230> studio<00:00:04.830> to<00:00:04.920> system

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:07.970 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.919 

this<00:00:08.970> is<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.389> RCA<00:00:09.750> studio<00:00:10.320> to<00:00:11.599> doesn't<00:00:12.599> have

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
this is the RCA studio to doesn't have

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.160 
this is the RCA studio to doesn't have
controllers<00:00:14.240> you<00:00:15.240> actually<00:00:15.570> have<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.780> pick<00:00:15.960> up

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
controllers you actually have to pick up

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:23.080 
controllers you actually have to pick up
the<00:00:16.949> system<00:00:17.480> by<00:00:18.480> hand<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.820> just<00:00:20.820> hope<00:00:21.390> that

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
the system by hand and just hope that

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.179 
the system by hand and just hope that
how<00:00:24.090> are<00:00:24.119> you<00:00:24.240> supposed<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.570> do<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.960> play<00:00:25.199> guess

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
how are you supposed to do to play guess

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.880 
how are you supposed to do to play guess
one<00:00:26.430> person<00:00:26.849> would<00:00:26.970> want<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.300> sit<00:00:27.570> on<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.650> left

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
one person would want to sit on the left

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.790 
one person would want to sit on the left
and<00:00:29.130> another<00:00:29.250> on<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.670> right<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.590> push<00:00:31.590> the

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
and another on the right and push the

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:39.590 
and another on the right and push the
buttons<00:00:35.149> the<00:00:36.149> AC<00:00:36.300> adapter<00:00:36.950> strangely<00:00:38.600> plugs

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
buttons the AC adapter strangely plugs

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.080 
buttons the AC adapter strangely plugs
in<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.730> the<00:00:41.730> RF<00:00:42.059> switch<00:00:42.360> box<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:43.879> only<00:00:44.879> has<00:00:45.059> a

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
in to the RF switch box and only has a

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.270 
in to the RF switch box and only has a
UHF<00:00:45.870> output<00:00:46.590> so<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.370> actually<00:00:47.760> have<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.480> use<00:00:49.280> a

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
UHF output so you actually have to use a

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.430 
UHF output so you actually have to use a
converter<00:00:50.879> if<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.600> want<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.899> plug<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.199> into<00:00:52.350> a

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
converter if you want to plug it into a

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.299 
converter if you want to plug it into a
VHF<00:00:54.050> so<00:00:55.050> in<00:00:55.320> order<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.559> turn<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:55.949> on<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.280> just

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
VHF so in order to turn it on you just

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.130 
VHF so in order to turn it on you just
let<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:56.910> slide<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.780> switch<00:00:59.780> and<00:01:00.780> all<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.050> get

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
let you slide the switch and all you get

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:17.060 
let you slide the switch and all you get
is<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.289> black<00:01:01.620> screen

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070

don't<00:04:42.450> know<00:04:42.540> what<00:04:42.690> this<00:04:42.840> is<00:04:43.050> about<00:04:46.250> so<00:04:47.250> that's

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
don't know what this is about so that's

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.360 
don't know what this is about so that's
it<00:04:47.760> for<00:04:47.790> the<00:04:48.120> virus<00:04:48.360> scans<00:04:48.930> on<00:04:49.320> the<00:04:49.350> RCA<00:04:49.860> studio

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
it for the virus scans on the RCA studio

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.370 
it for the virus scans on the RCA studio
to<00:04:52.460> not<00:04:53.460> much<00:04:53.700> too<00:04:54.060> good<00:04:54.510> to<00:04:54.690> say<00:04:54.900> about<00:04:54.930> this

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
to not much too good to say about this

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.150 
to not much too good to say about this
system<00:04:55.680> but<00:04:56.280> that<00:04:57.180> it<00:04:57.330> was<00:04:57.800> behind<00:04:58.800> the

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
system but that it was behind the

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:05.420 
system but that it was behind the
technology<00:04:59.430> of<00:05:00.000> its<00:05:00.210> time<00:05:04.250> it's<00:05:05.250> probably

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
technology of its time it's probably

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.590 
technology of its time it's probably
cheaper<00:05:05.760> to<00:05:06.300> produce<00:05:06.450> but<00:05:07.080> the<00:05:07.890> games<00:05:08.130> just

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 
cheaper to produce but the games just

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.450 
cheaper to produce but the games just
weren't<00:05:09.600> up<00:05:09.750> that<00:05:09.990> great<00:05:10.260> all<00:05:10.830> black<00:05:11.250> and

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
weren't up that great all black and

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.920 
weren't up that great all black and
white<00:05:12.350> sound<00:05:13.350> coming<00:05:13.650> out<00:05:13.860> of<00:05:13.920> the<00:05:14.100> system<00:05:14.930> not

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
white sound coming out of the system not

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.090 
white sound coming out of the system not
not<00:05:16.710> not<00:05:16.980> much<00:05:17.310> variety<00:05:17.580> either
