a<00:01:35.140> very<00:01:35.320> different<00:01:35.500> concept<00:01:35.890> and<00:01:36.400> we<00:01:36.580> are

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
a very different concept and we are

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.190 
a very different concept and we are
paying<00:01:36.880> tribute<00:01:37.090> to<00:01:37.420> hundred<00:01:37.840> years<00:01:38.020> of

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
cinema so I think with more of that and

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.570 
cinema so I think with more of that and
a<00:01:40.990> very<00:01:41.260> different<00:01:41.560> story<00:01:41.979> with<00:01:42.280> lot<00:01:42.490> of
