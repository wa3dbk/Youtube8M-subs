00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:03.940
 Setting Up Concerned Problems Concerns Ever Concerned 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.190
 British 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.980
 As Nikon has taken the lead 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.139
 I'm going to speed the US d2 as it is 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.400
 But I will chase after the second wear on the monitor 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.299
 Speed ​​is yes 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:17.679
 Yeah 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:21.669
 When I chase after something, I catch up after a minute 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:23.539
 Answer 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.189
 Declared that walking time to grow healthy is significantly reduced 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.309
 What's important here is that the trend is how much I walked 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.490
 It is 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.370
 ja Oh, it's not such a hard time 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.430
 Since the elder brother is chasing, picton departs every time 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.560
 I mean 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.810
 US senior officials 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.980
 Than the average brother walked 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.570
 Ten- 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.690
 Lol 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.499
 Because I am walking a lot 

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:01.840
 I'm walking over 12 wards 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:02.650
 from here 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.650
 I will show it to end the talk that the takedown has progressed 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.710
 Peak is at a speed of 60 and there are several dozens of Eric households 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.050
 It turns out that 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.410
 It is a huge rock that advanced 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.410
 Because it is time to go hill 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.979
 Shake in the wind like 60 pix 82 meters ahead 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.120
 veoh 23 at a speed of 150 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.920
 dexfont 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.920
 Because it is walking 150 yen 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.800
 Hayasaka approaching 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.670
 Management and this 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.130
 To the important point of the problem to chase 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.880
 We caught up when distance which two advanced was in the same city 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.450
 It's about time 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.700
 With the distance the US military has advanced 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.060
 The distance the older brother has advanced is familiar but now the older brother is 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.230
 The equation is because it has caught up 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.700
 60 minutes 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.140
 Smoldering person 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.100
 Or later 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.100
 2150x 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:13.989
 It will be at once in the same school 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.330
 In addition, when you can take the operation cylinder of meter meter 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.049
 I'll leave for a while as part of being called 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.689
 Struggle angry at arrest detention for the first six minutes 

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:27.169
 Locked 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:30.969
 Usually all during the lock is 70 yen 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:33.609
 15x of high 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:40.809
 72 schools to connect to 115 Knicks at Yahoo!-7 o'clock 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.599
 -It was 962.9 billion yen 

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:47.339
 Same minus 7 

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:50.149
 ORIX knows 

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:54.689
 Then if you win against 237 yen to win your success 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:56.129
 Answered 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.129
 I didn't have it and I had to go 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:00.059
 further 

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:03.669
 You can catch up at how many meters from api 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:05.930
 Then Ja is real 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.480
 I would like to ask what two people have advanced 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.479
 In other words, I have no choice but to ask 

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:14.399
 I have blood here 

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:17.399
 The former army has calculated the distance traveled 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.679
 Hachioji is here 

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:24.669
 Is the older brother calculating the distance traveled? 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:26.169
 I-kun's 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:30.249
 There are 60 floors and 58 numbers 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:37.689
 It is 1200 meters because face is similar at speed of 60 for 20 minutes 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:40.689
 I'm going 

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:42.859
 brother is 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:45.929
 $ 150 to 98 

00:03:45.929 --> 00:03:47.979
 1,200 

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:50.069
 Then talks that wearing advanced 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:51.339
 Rice 

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:53.139
 Be the same 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:55.399
 The answer is clear 

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:58.399
 Bungo 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:02.439
 2200 meters in London 

00:04:04.779 --> 00:04:06.089
