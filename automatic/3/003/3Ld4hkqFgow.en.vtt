00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.180 
big pile that he's got up there and I
see<00:04:50.240> he<00:04:50.390> took<00:04:50.540> the<00:04:50.690> tractor<00:04:50.960> this<00:04:51.740> is<00:04:51.890> a<00:04:51.920> big

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
see he took the tractor this is a big

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.510 
see he took the tractor this is a big
mound<00:04:52.430> it<00:04:52.790> looks<00:04:52.910> like<00:04:53.060> he<00:04:53.210> pushed<00:04:53.990> that

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
mound it looks like he pushed that

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.890 
mound it looks like he pushed that
pushed<00:04:55.520> that<00:04:55.670> down<00:04:55.910> so<00:04:56.270> he<00:04:56.480> could<00:04:56.600> back<00:04:56.720> the

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
pushed that down so he could back the

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.380 
pushed that down so he could back the
pickup<00:04:57.170> truck<00:04:57.410> here<00:04:57.860> and<00:04:57.980> load<00:04:58.880> up<00:04:58.910> the<00:04:59.210> rest

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
pickup truck here and load up the rest

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.450 
pickup truck here and load up the rest
of<00:04:59.540> that<00:04:59.690> wood<00:04:59.990> and<00:05:00.170> then<00:05:00.920> what<00:05:01.100> he'll<00:05:01.250> do

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
of that wood and then what he'll do

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.950 
of that wood and then what he'll do
he'll<00:05:01.640> say<00:05:01.850> Behrman<00:05:02.270> up<00:05:02.390> because<00:05:02.720> in<00:05:02.840> the

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
he'll say Behrman up because in the

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.920 
he'll say Behrman up because in the
spring<00:05:04.030> earlier<00:05:05.030> this<00:05:05.210> year<00:05:05.270> we<00:05:05.540> had<00:05:05.570> a<00:05:05.690> lot<00:05:05.750> of

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
spring earlier this year we had a lot of

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.970 
spring earlier this year we had a lot of
water<00:05:06.140> and<00:05:06.460> there<00:05:07.460> was<00:05:07.610> a<00:05:07.640> kind<00:05:08.240> of<00:05:08.270> a<00:05:08.360> dam<00:05:08.540> here

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
water and there was a kind of a dam here

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.750 
water and there was a kind of a dam here
so<00:05:09.980> I<00:05:10.370> think<00:05:10.780> that's<00:05:11.780> about<00:05:12.200> it

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
so I think that's about it

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
so I think that's about it
for<00:05:14.050> the<00:05:15.050> spring<00:05:15.320> projects<00:05:16.180> but<00:05:17.180> if<00:05:17.630> you're

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
for the spring projects but if you're

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.650 
for the spring projects but if you're
curious<00:05:18.020> about<00:05:18.410> living<00:05:18.890> off-grid<00:05:19.660> nothing

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
curious about living off-grid nothing

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.090 
curious about living off-grid nothing
fancy<00:05:21.170> just<00:05:21.820> a<00:05:22.930> lot<00:05:23.930> of<00:05:23.960> things<00:05:24.260> that<00:05:24.500> go<00:05:24.560> on<00:05:24.680> in

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
fancy just a lot of things that go on in

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.440 
fancy just a lot of things that go on in
the<00:05:25.250> spring<00:05:25.990> that<00:05:26.990> keep<00:05:27.230> you<00:05:27.320> busy<00:05:28.300> thanks<00:05:29.300> for

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:29.450
