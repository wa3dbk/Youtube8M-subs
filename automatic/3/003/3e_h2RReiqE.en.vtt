00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:09.210
 Let's talk about the cup. 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:11.759
 about the good and the bad times not 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.929
 You have very good moments of this cup. 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.310
 Cup 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:20.609
 from the point of view of sporting 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:26.970
 football view played on the field have 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:30.560
 presented the matches is excellent 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.099
 quality speaks of the obvious going there 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.390
 Spain 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:39.510
 I'm not even going to talk about the hobby at the age of 30 and 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.059
 few years ago a new minimum of 20 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.680
 I do not think the cup is overtaking 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.780
 expectations from the sporting point of view 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.719
 huh 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.230
 to negative things clear as per 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.370
 For example, some groups have 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.940
 Croatia 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.260
 This for me is a strange thing. 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.980
 because it's not that we're going to use the 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.769
 football like a catu pond 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.930
 patriotism but in Brazil the selection 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.180
 Brazilian society is always seen as a 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.170
 representative of the country 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:17.340
 You can not do that to anyone. 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:21.840
 It's fitting, I 'm not going to talk about it. 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:25.229
 another episode occurred in the game brazil and 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:30.020
 Croatia because we have to return the 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.020
 theme of education 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:38.820
 why this reveals is a deficiency in the 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:42.410
 conception of what it is to be educated 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:47.850
 I was a feline philosopher here 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:50.580
 American woman called a dilma who was born 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.170
 around the war of secession and died 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.910
 just before the Korean War on 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.170
 however lived many years passed through 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:02:01.860
 several universities wrote things 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:05.250
 wonderful about education to education 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.740
 understood as an autonomous individual within 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.140
 of society with respect to another 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.709
 especially the question of the other 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.739
 the responsibility of facing the other 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:20.820
 as a difference but as a source 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:26.370
 also of learning to teach 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:28.920
 of personal advancement in relation to the 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.410
 other then I think first of all 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.440
 before you speak about condemnation 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:39.060
 implement a simplistic way of 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:42.420
 way to feed what happened to us 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.420
 We need to rethink our account. 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:49.370
 rethink our conception of education 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.370
 It might be worth a day and I 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:59.010
 American pragmatism that can not 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:02.370
 He is accused of leftist who in 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:06.690
 man who sought to value inheritances 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:11.269
 of the Enlightenment and therefore in freedom 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.269
 and high personal enrichment
