00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:09.170
 and now we have the good arms let's go 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.809
 to start a game so they can see that 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.120
 the so- called mode is completely good 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.620
 this type 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.370
 Well let's see 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.370
 and it's loading 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.310
 and well, this is nothing, this is the 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.000
 rayito of that type 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:37.550
 this rayito let's see what it has inside 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.290
 and well let's see what happens here in 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:47.240
 this is my little billy house 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:51.350
 that went well and well let's see if 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:55.300
 we have them and now 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:58.140
 here are my most weapons 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:03.030
 Well, here we are going to see how they are used 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:08.150
 past where you are in that army 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:16.630
 the pig hand pickman 9.26 magnitude 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:16.630
 where the hell he got into the jungle 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.690
 I threw him and a button 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:26.070
 wow I'll get branco so we can and 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.070
 take with all the desire of the world 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.830
 and 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.830
 it is impossible 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:40.310
 that follow the pants 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:45.340
 but against him 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.340
 they do not have the 82 damn you pickman 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.790
 well this meant it would be similar 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.790
 having put 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.649
 let's use another more powerful weapon 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.970
 Well, it's worth it 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.729
 I killed a motorcycle and motorcycle Enough 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.660
 Witnesses who feel like after 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.660
 win 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.890
 and then it will go wrong 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.730
 it's a little fun 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.930
 then this mostly on my part 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.620
 as they saw if it works it does not have everything and 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.819
 well 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.010
 at the station I told them no more 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.060
 comprise of simple bonds now that 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.599
 we have if it's all 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.599
 goodbye
