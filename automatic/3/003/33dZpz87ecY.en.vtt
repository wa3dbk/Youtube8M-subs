 you are very well 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.509
 so you ask why I'm here 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.119
 certainly from the first 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:33.420
 question why I gained weight 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.670
 so I made sorrel 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.780
 why am I here because I do not 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.239
 do not understand what will say flies since 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.469
 two years with his accent so it's beautiful 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.780
 that a little by chance is going to say are 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:46.180
 absent either that in the first part 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.739

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.720
 good child behind the curtain he stands 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.450
 an amazing trick of lights 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.440
 it's jean michel jarre and will make a 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.610
 lighthouse call will no longer be 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.899
 of electricity their 18th at the hall makes 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.270
 pleasure it makes me very happy 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:04.089
 rachid he returned to my heart without 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.549
 stop a kindness it's north 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.119
 American while we French and who 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:11.469
 has a foreign body to tests first 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.170
 already endured it's an asshole and everything 

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:15.580
 after which he returns to it I think that 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.870
 nothing 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.290
 so like that we saw it maybe I 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.540
 a little bit but I 'm calm 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:27.250
 I'm on the on the back I'm 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:30.730

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.610
 moderate know what is the simple ui 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.830
 fashion and not even if I do not know what 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.850

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:51.630
 his hand who do not eat pork they 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:52.979
