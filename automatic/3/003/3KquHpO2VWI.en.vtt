00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.080
Frozen vessels creeping on the darkening horizon

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.720
A soccer-team in the haze of night

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.600
Badlands near the border, an old woman heading home

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.160
A faithful lighthouse twinkling in the dark

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.560
Snow slowly dancing in the streetlights of the alley

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.240
Songs and laughter from the local bar

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.120
A lonely road to nowhere, disappearing in the woods

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.240
Northern lights flicker across the sky

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.560
It’s then that the great melancholy rolls in

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:21.040
And down from the northern sea blows a frozen wind

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.120
Far out in the channel there’s a midnight-ferry moaning

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.440
On the other side, another world waiting

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.760
A Volvo keeps on striving in the headwind of the bridge

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.880
Theatres are dimming down their lights

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.360
A northern train is howling like a wolf under the moon

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.560
Distant farms, you hardly see their glow

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.600
As winter sweeps in, the islands beg for mercy

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.160
While cityscapes sway in the cold

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:15.680
It’s then that the great melancholy rolls in

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:25.920
And down from the northern sea blows a frozen wind
