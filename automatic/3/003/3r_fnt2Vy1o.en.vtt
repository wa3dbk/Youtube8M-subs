that<00:00:50.260> kind<00:00:50.560> of<00:00:50.650> finish<00:00:50.980> it's<00:00:51.190> not<00:00:51.400> too

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.730 
that kind of finish it's not too
overpowering<00:00:52.120> so<00:00:52.870> I<00:00:52.900> think<00:00:53.350> pretty<00:00:53.620> much

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:53.740 
overpowering so I think pretty much

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.350 
overpowering so I think pretty much
anybody<00:00:54.100> could<00:00:54.400> get<00:00:54.460> away<00:00:54.579> with<00:00:54.700> wearing<00:00:54.970> it<00:00:55.210> I

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
anybody could get away with wearing it I

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.300 
anybody could get away with wearing it I
ended<00:00:55.810> up<00:00:55.870> powdering<00:00:56.230> just<00:00:56.739> a<00:00:56.800> little<00:00:57.010> bit<00:00:57.130> in

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.790 
ended up powdering just a little bit in
my<00:00:57.520> t-zone<00:00:57.730> so<00:00:58.210> it's<00:00:58.329> not<00:00:58.480> too<00:00:58.750> dewy<00:00:59.050> and<00:00:59.350> then

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
my t-zone so it's not too dewy and then

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.560

00:01:51.269 --> 00:01:51.279 
palette and now for the eyeliner I

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:53.609 
palette and now for the eyeliner I
decided<00:01:51.759> to<00:01:51.999> use<00:01:52.029> this<00:01:52.359> dark<00:01:52.719> olive<00:01:52.929> green

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
decided to use this dark olive green

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.859 
decided to use this dark olive green
with<00:01:53.889> some<00:01:54.099> gold<00:01:54.340> reflex<00:01:54.909> in<00:01:55.090> it<00:01:55.240> for<00:01:55.479> eyeliner

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
with some gold reflex in it for eyeliner

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.469 
with some gold reflex in it for eyeliner
because<00:01:56.409> it's<00:01:56.740> very<00:01:56.979> soft<00:01:57.279> for<00:01:57.789> an<00:01:58.090> everyday

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
because it's very soft for an everyday

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.749 
because it's very soft for an everyday
kind<00:01:58.869> of<00:01:59.020> makeup<00:01:59.229> look<00:01:59.560> and<00:01:59.770> then<00:02:00.130> i<00:02:00.159> used<00:02:00.429> the

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
kind of makeup look and then i used the

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:02.910 
kind of makeup look and then i used the
new<00:02:01.179> covergirl<00:02:01.659> mascara<00:02:02.380> which<00:02:02.590> is<00:02:02.709> called

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
new covergirl mascara which is called

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.440 
new covergirl mascara which is called
the<00:02:03.069> super<00:02:03.219> sizer<00:02:03.579> and<00:02:03.759> i<00:02:04.060> think<00:02:04.329> you're

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
the super sizer and i think you're

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.179 
the super sizer and i think you're
supposed<00:02:04.749> to<00:02:04.869> actually<00:02:04.990> like<00:02:05.319> twirl<00:02:05.740> the<00:02:05.950> wand

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
supposed to actually like twirl the wand

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.010 
supposed to actually like twirl the wand
when<00:02:06.429> you<00:02:06.579> use<00:02:06.759> it<00:02:06.939> to<00:02:06.969> get<00:02:07.209> the<00:02:07.359> best<00:02:07.509> effect

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
when you use it to get the best effect

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.320

so i used this ionic hair brush by

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.240 
so i used this ionic hair brush by
Conair<00:03:25.870> and<00:03:26.170> this<00:03:26.560> is<00:03:26.680> really<00:03:26.829> cool<00:03:27.100> because

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
Conair and this is really cool because

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.039 
Conair and this is really cool because
it's<00:03:27.579> actually<00:03:27.730> battery-powered<00:03:28.420> and

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
it's actually battery-powered and

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.710 
it's actually battery-powered and
basically<00:03:30.010> what<00:03:30.310> it<00:03:30.370> does<00:03:30.459> is<00:03:30.970> it's<00:03:31.420> kind<00:03:31.660> of

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
basically what it does is it's kind of

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.550 
basically what it does is it's kind of
like<00:03:31.900> an<00:03:32.109> ionic<00:03:32.950> hair<00:03:33.160> dryer<00:03:33.940> it<00:03:34.329> uses<00:03:34.870> like

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
like an ionic hair dryer it uses like

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.530 
like an ionic hair dryer it uses like
negative<00:03:36.040> ion<00:03:36.400> technology<00:03:36.670> or<00:03:37.239> something

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
negative ion technology or something

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.150 
negative ion technology or something
like<00:03:37.660> that<00:03:37.720> it's<00:03:38.079> on<00:03:38.230> the<00:03:38.320> box<00:03:38.530> but<00:03:38.799> basically
