00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:14.700

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.369
 what we are going to do darkin 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.710
 Well this is more like a trampoline 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.449
 of Minecraft 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.449
 that elevates you to the heavens 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:33.629
 see what a box has to be made 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.379
 5 x 5 with reddish stones and truth 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:36.379
 what is this 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.949
 that is, the wood is there and a little button 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.640
 well let's see how this works in 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:46.640
 what channel did you see it 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:54.140
 ok and let's see how it works says that 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:56.899
 is a trampoline will jump by the 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.229
 heavens and let's see that 'it's not the 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.229
 First 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.050
 to 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.430
 and you have to put it around 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.990
 of the block below the block of wood no 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.550
 put nothing because otherwise it will not 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:14.220
 function 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:17.310
 then you put here clear yes 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:21.920
 is going to select the button and we're going to 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:24.920
 see here the presentation 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.920
 LOL 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:32.539
 being a trampoline and hey 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:34.030
 we need a diamond armor 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:37.049
 force 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.820
 it can not be from the pieces just that 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:43.119
 Maybe it's just that life is not so low 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.520
 because of the armor in which he works ok 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:51.100
 now I go I say that I have to tighten the 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:54.390
 button that we're going to press the button quoted 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.390
 and but first let's actions 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.360
 ok then I start a 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:12.990
 and now it looks sad 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.130
 but I liked it then you say that with 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:20.760
 any of any type of armor 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:22.560
 just take care that although good 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.960

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.090

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.160

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.550
