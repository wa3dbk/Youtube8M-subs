00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.320 
I like to design better than the slim I
bet<00:01:54.070> most<00:01:54.280> of<00:01:54.460> you<00:01:54.580> do<00:01:54.759> too

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
bet most of you do too

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.679 
bet most of you do too
but<00:01:56.080> it's<00:01:56.530> your<00:01:56.680> smart<00:01:56.979> play<00:01:57.280> the<00:01:58.180> games<00:01:58.450> are

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
but it's your smart play the games are

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:00.990 
but it's your smart play the games are
really<00:01:58.869> good<00:01:59.290> it<00:01:59.560> just<00:01:59.740> goes<00:01:59.890> to<00:01:59.950> a<00:02:00.250> thousand

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
really good it just goes to a thousand

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.460 
really good it just goes to a thousand
eighty<00:02:01.180> pixels<00:02:01.540> or<00:02:02.110> a<00:02:02.170> thousand<00:02:02.740> ATI<00:02:03.479> so<00:02:04.479> it's

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
eighty pixels or a thousand ATI so it's

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.550 
eighty pixels or a thousand ATI so it's
really<00:02:05.830> good<00:02:06.539> and<00:02:07.539> the<00:02:07.690> graphics<00:02:08.170> aren't<00:02:08.380> that

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
really good and the graphics aren't that

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:16.130 
really good and the graphics aren't that
bad<00:02:08.800> I<00:02:11.280> believe<00:02:12.280> this<00:02:12.550> is<00:02:13.440> sixth<00:02:14.440> or<00:02:14.709> seventh

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
bad I believe this is sixth or seventh

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:23.520 
bad I believe this is sixth or seventh
generation<00:02:17.140> consoles<00:02:18.390> so<00:02:20.760> global<00:02:22.530> this

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
generation consoles so global this

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:30.539 
generation consoles so global this
interior<00:02:24.519> does<00:02:25.330> not<00:02:25.600> have<00:02:26.050> the<00:02:26.980> block<00:02:28.709> it<00:02:29.709> has

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
interior does not have the block it has

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.880 
interior does not have the block it has
an<00:02:30.790> internal<00:02:31.239> power<00:02:31.630> supply<00:02:31.930> instead<00:02:32.739> of

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
an internal power supply instead of

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.100 
an internal power supply instead of
having<00:02:33.069> it<00:02:33.340> brick<00:02:33.819> or<00:02:34.030> anything<00:02:34.239> like<00:02:34.540> that<00:02:34.600> so

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
having it brick or anything like that so

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.059 
having it brick or anything like that so
that's<00:02:35.739> good<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:37.720> there<00:02:37.959> we<00:02:38.110> go<00:02:38.140> any<00:02:38.739> blu-ray

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
that's good and there we go any blu-ray

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:44.970 
that's good and there we go any blu-ray
