00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
guys know I've been covering a lot of

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:35.639 
guys know I've been covering a lot of
1.6.4<00:01:32.410> s<00:01:32.680> but<00:01:33.160> this<00:01:33.340> one<00:01:33.580> is<00:01:34.380> 1.7.2<00:01:35.380> so<00:01:35.590> if

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
1.6.4 s but this one is 1.7.2 so if

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:38.700 
1.6.4 s but this one is 1.7.2 so if
those<00:01:35.770> you<00:01:35.920> guys<00:01:36.100> do<00:01:36.280> like<00:01:36.399> 1.7.2<00:01:37.500> this<00:01:38.500> one

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
those you guys do like 1.7.2 this one

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.290 
those you guys do like 1.7.2 this one
works<00:01:39.040> for<00:01:39.250> that<00:01:39.399> so<00:01:39.580> I<00:01:39.610> just<00:01:39.640> thought<00:01:39.880> kind<00:01:40.180> of

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
works for that so I just thought kind of

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.420 
works for that so I just thought kind of
let<00:01:40.690> you<00:01:40.780> guys<00:01:40.930> know<00:01:41.170> that<00:01:41.200> as<00:01:41.530> well<00:01:41.799> and<00:01:42.010> we've

let you guys know that as well and we've

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.039 
let you guys know that as well and we've
got<00:01:42.610> the<00:01:42.790> villagers<00:01:43.240> from<00:01:43.390> yesterday's<00:01:43.840> video

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
got the villagers from yesterday's video

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.200 
got the villagers from yesterday's video
so<00:01:44.620> if<00:01:45.310> you<00:01:45.460> didn't<00:01:45.610> see<00:01:45.640> yesterday's<00:01:46.030> video

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
so if you didn't see yesterday's video

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.310 
so if you didn't see yesterday's video
you<00:01:46.360> can<00:01:46.479> go<00:01:46.570> check<00:01:46.630> it<00:01:46.870> out<00:01:46.930> if<00:01:47.080> you'd<00:01:47.229> like
