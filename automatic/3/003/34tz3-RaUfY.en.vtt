be using number one me goofing around so

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.410 
be using number one me goofing around so
I'll<00:01:01.280> be<00:01:01.460> cutting<00:01:01.850> the<00:01:01.969> air<00:01:02.149> in<00:01:02.449> off<00:01:04.059> because<00:01:05.059> I

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
I'll be cutting the air in off because I

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.660 
I'll be cutting the air in off because I
don't<00:01:05.510> want<00:01:05.780> it<00:01:05.840> to<00:01:05.990> be<00:01:06.170> too<00:01:06.590> long

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.730 

the<00:01:12.670> thing<00:01:12.880> I<00:01:13.000> like<00:01:13.210> about<00:01:13.240> soft<00:01:13.990> dry<00:01:14.259> hair<00:01:14.530> is

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
the thing I like about soft dry hair is

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.940 
the thing I like about soft dry hair is
that<00:01:15.039> it<00:01:15.280> can<00:01:15.549> be<00:01:15.719> separated<00:01:16.719> into<00:01:17.320> like<00:01:17.710> three

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
that it can be separated into like three

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:30.539 
that it can be separated into like three
or<00:01:18.579> four<00:01:19.119> different<00:01:19.299> small<00:01:20.020> sections

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.609 

so<00:01:31.549> just<00:01:31.759> a<00:01:31.850> small<00:01:31.969> demonstration<00:01:32.359> on<00:01:33.200> how<00:01:33.229> it

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
so just a small demonstration on how it

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:48.570 
so just a small demonstration on how it
will<00:01:33.770> look<00:01:33.799> without<00:01:34.640> being<00:01:35.710> separated

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.520 

so<00:01:49.580> this<00:01:49.790> is<00:01:49.939> how<00:01:50.090> it<00:01:50.240> will<00:01:50.390> look<00:01:50.450> it<00:01:51.020> will<00:01:51.320> kind

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
so this is how it will look it will kind

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.490 
so this is how it will look it will kind
of<00:01:51.619> give<00:01:51.680> you<00:01:52.070> like<00:01:52.400> a<00:01:52.700> fox<00:01:53.270> boxy<00:01:54.110> kind<00:01:54.350> of

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
of give you like a fox boxy kind of

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.499 
of give you like a fox boxy kind of
looks<00:01:54.650> a<00:01:55.270> dreadlock

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
looks a dreadlock

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.510 
looks a dreadlock
looks<00:01:56.780> which<00:01:57.380> is<00:01:57.530> why<00:01:57.680> they<00:01:57.890> call<00:01:58.100> it<00:01:58.130> soft

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
looks which is why they call it soft

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.180 
looks which is why they call it soft
dress<00:01:58.729> but<00:01:59.600> I'm<00:01:59.869> not<00:02:00.170> going<00:02:00.440> for<00:02:00.680> that<00:02:00.710> style

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
dress but I'm not going for that style

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.480 
dress but I'm not going for that style
today<00:02:01.690> probably<00:02:02.690> next<00:02:03.049> time<00:02:03.350> I'll<00:02:04.159> be

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
today probably next time I'll be

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.840 
today probably next time I'll be
separating<00:02:05.149> my<00:02:05.330> here<00:02:09.100> into<00:02:10.100> like<00:02:10.520> three

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
separating my here into like three

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.199 
separating my here into like three
different<00:02:10.970> sections<00:02:11.390> for<00:02:12.910> installation<00:02:13.910> I'll

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
different sections for installation I'll

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:15.790 
different sections for installation I'll
do<00:02:14.450> it<00:02:14.569> just<00:02:14.750> like<00:02:14.930> how<00:02:15.140> I<00:02:15.170> do<00:02:15.319> my<00:02:15.620> regular

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
do it just like how I do my regular

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:33.820 
do it just like how I do my regular
crochet<00:02:16.760> braids

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.500 

what<00:02:34.830> I<00:02:34.860> like<00:02:35.040> about<00:02:35.220> a<00:02:35.400> soft<00:02:35.790> jet<00:02:36.030> here<00:02:36.300> is

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
what I like about a soft jet here is

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.980 
what I like about a soft jet here is
that<00:02:36.810> you<00:02:37.200> don't<00:02:37.410> have<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:37.950> like<00:02:38.820> not<00:02:39.390> it's<00:02:39.600> our

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
that you don't have to like not it's our

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.560 
that you don't have to like not it's our
loop<00:02:40.470> it<00:02:40.710> more<00:02:41.070> than<00:02:41.310> two<00:02:41.700> or<00:02:41.910> three<00:02:41.940> times

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
loop it more than two or three times

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.950 
loop it more than two or three times
because<00:02:43.200> it<00:02:43.680> won't<00:02:43.920> unravel<00:02:44.610> because<00:02:45.360> it's

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
because it won't unravel because it's

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.790 
because it won't unravel because it's
actually<00:02:46.230> pretty<00:02:46.710> thick<00:02:48.110> so<00:02:49.110> it's<00:02:49.290> not<00:02:49.560> like

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
actually pretty thick so it's not like

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.450 
actually pretty thick so it's not like
the<00:02:50.010> softer<00:02:50.640> texture<00:02:51.240> here

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
the softer texture here

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:59.850 
the softer texture here
it's<00:02:53.460> another<00:02:53.760> demonstration

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:10.510 

loop<00:03:01.150> one<00:03:02.410> loose<00:03:03.410> -<00:03:04.420> and<00:03:05.420> there<00:03:05.780> you<00:03:05.810> go<00:03:09.520> so

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
loop one loose - and there you go so

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.260 
loop one loose - and there you go so
yeah

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
yeah

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.820 
yeah
I<00:03:13.370> like<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.550> look

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.450 

so<00:03:18.370> I'm<00:03:18.460> almost<00:03:18.790> finished<00:03:19.090> and<00:03:20.130> this<00:03:21.130> is<00:03:21.310> how

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.460 
so I'm almost finished and this is how

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:28.710 
so I'm almost finished and this is how
it<00:03:21.610> looks<00:03:21.790> so<00:03:22.030> far<00:03:26.520> yep<00:03:27.520> that's<00:03:27.970> me<00:03:28.210> crazy

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
it looks so far yep that's me crazy

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:50.620 
it looks so far yep that's me crazy
mushy

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.170 

and<00:03:50.720> because<00:03:51.590> I'm<00:03:51.920> probably<00:03:52.400> gonna<00:03:52.640> rest<00:03:52.970> and

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
and because I'm probably gonna rest and

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.480 
and because I'm probably gonna rest and
two<00:03:53.300> apart<00:03:53.630> most<00:03:53.810> of<00:03:54.020> the<00:03:54.140> time<00:03:54.410> I'm<00:03:54.680> trying<00:03:55.160> to

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:55.490 
two apart most of the time I'm trying to

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:37.749 
two apart most of the time I'm trying to
get<00:03:55.640> the<00:03:55.820> hair<00:03:56.060> pretty<00:03:56.600> close<00:03:57.260> together

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:37.759 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:42.229 

and<00:04:38.759> our<00:04:38.969> four<00:04:39.299> finished<00:04:39.749> look<00:04:40.819> so<00:04:41.819> this<00:04:42.089> is

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:42.239 
and our four finished look so this is

00:04:42.239 --> 00:04:44.539 
and our four finished look so this is
how<00:04:42.359> it<00:04:42.539> looks<00:04:42.719> when<00:04:42.809> it<00:04:42.989> finished<00:04:43.379> and<00:04:43.679> I

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:44.549
