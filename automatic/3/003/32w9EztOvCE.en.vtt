00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
that tiny little thing smallest one I've

that tiny little thing smallest one I've

2.4<00:03:59.579> gigahertz<00:03:59.609> antenna<00:04:00.269> because<00:04:00.480> it's<00:04:00.630> so

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
2.4 gigahertz antenna because it's so

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.809 
2.4 gigahertz antenna because it's so
long<00:04:01.049> but<00:04:01.530> really<00:04:01.829> most<00:04:01.980> of<00:04:02.250> this<00:04:02.370> is<00:04:02.609> for

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
long but really most of this is for

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.729 
long but really most of this is for
running<00:04:03.120> length<00:04:03.329> the<00:04:03.780> only<00:04:03.989> actual<00:04:04.230> intent<00:04:04.590> is

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
running length the only actual intent is

running length the only actual intent is
this<00:04:04.919> last<00:04:05.190> little<00:04:05.370> piece<00:04:05.700> here<00:04:05.730> so<00:04:06.450> if<00:04:06.540> you

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
this last little piece here so if you

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.180 
this last little piece here so if you
say<00:04:06.810> to<00:04:06.870> yourself<00:04:06.959> why<00:04:07.349> is<00:04:07.410> it<00:04:07.560> so<00:04:07.709> long<00:04:07.889> well

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
say to yourself why is it so long well

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.740 
say to yourself why is it so long well
they've<00:04:08.609> done<00:04:08.790> that<00:04:08.940> so<00:04:09.090> you<00:04:09.150> can<00:04:09.329> run<00:04:09.450> another

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
they've done that so you can run another

looking<00:04:34.320> at<00:04:34.440> this<00:04:34.530> whole<00:04:34.740> setup<00:04:34.980> is<00:04:35.220> how

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
looking at this whole setup is how

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.490 
looking at this whole setup is how
they've<00:04:35.580> mounted<00:04:35.760> the<00:04:36.420> motor<00:04:36.690> wires<00:04:37.020> you<00:04:37.350> can

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
they've mounted the motor wires you can

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.560 
they've mounted the motor wires you can
see<00:04:37.740> it<00:04:38.190> stick<00:04:38.460> out<00:04:38.610> the<00:04:38.760> side<00:04:39.030> here<00:04:39.060> and

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
see it stick out the side here and

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:40.850 
see it stick out the side here and
that's<00:04:39.780> the<00:04:39.930> first<00:04:40.200> thing<00:04:40.350> that's<00:04:40.590> going<00:04:40.800> to

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
that's the first thing that's going to

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.500 
that's the first thing that's going to
get<00:04:41.010> hit<00:04:41.160> if<00:04:41.280> you<00:04:41.370> get<00:04:41.520> a<00:04:41.550> nice<00:04:41.760> decent<00:04:42.090> side

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
get hit if you get a nice decent side

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.420 
get hit if you get a nice decent side
impact<00:04:42.930> I<00:04:43.140> would<00:04:43.500> like<00:04:43.680> to<00:04:43.800> see<00:04:43.980> some<00:04:44.220> nerf

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
impact I would like to see some nerf

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.040

bars<00:04:44.760> some<00:04:45.090> scale<00:04:45.330> nerf<00:04:45.570> bars<00:04:45.810> that<00:04:46.020> are

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
bars some scale nerf bars that are

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.570 
bars some scale nerf bars that are
actually<00:04:46.200> functional<00:04:46.800> to<00:04:46.920> help<00:04:47.070> protect<00:04:47.220> that

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580

I<00:04:47.790> could<00:04:48.210> see<00:04:48.420> if<00:04:48.540> you<00:04:48.660> take<00:04:48.840> a<00:04:48.870> few<00:04:49.140> too<00:04:49.290> many

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
I could see if you take a few too many

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.480 
I could see if you take a few too many
hits<00:04:49.680> on<00:04:49.830> there<00:04:49.980> you're<00:04:50.040> probably<00:04:50.250> going<00:04:50.430> to

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
hits on there you're probably going to

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.490 
hits on there you're probably going to
damage<00:04:50.700> the<00:04:50.940> motor<00:04:51.090> so<00:04:51.480> the<00:04:51.900> first<00:04:52.110> upgrade<00:04:52.350> I

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
damage the motor so the first upgrade I

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.040 
damage the motor so the first upgrade I
do<00:04:52.620> would<00:04:52.860> probably<00:04:53.100> be<00:04:53.190> to<00:04:53.220> make<00:04:53.430> some<00:04:53.610> maca

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
do would probably be to make some maca
