interested keep watching so this is what
we're<00:00:13.980> working<00:00:14.190> with<00:00:14.580> today<00:00:14.820> this<00:00:15.630> is<00:00:15.900> an<00:00:16.049> old

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
we're working with today this is an old

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.220 
we're working with today this is an old
nerf<00:00:16.619> gun<00:00:16.920> that<00:00:17.130> I've<00:00:17.250> painted<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:18.150> this<00:00:18.990> is

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
nerf gun that I've painted and this is

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.900 
nerf gun that I've painted and this is
the<00:00:19.380> soldering<00:00:19.800> iron<00:00:19.980> in<00:00:20.490> case<00:00:20.670> you've<00:00:20.850> never

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
the soldering iron in case you've never

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.060 
the soldering iron in case you've never
seen<00:00:21.300> one<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.539> these<00:00:21.600> before<00:00:21.660> there's<00:00:22.650> an<00:00:22.859> on

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
seen one of these before there's an on

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.759 
seen one of these before there's an on
and<00:00:23.250> off<00:00:23.340> switch<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.570> temperature<00:00:25.410> control

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
and off switch and a temperature control

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.960 
and off switch and a temperature control
this<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:27.269> sponge<00:00:27.779> that<00:00:28.170> has<00:00:28.230> water<00:00:28.769> on<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.160> so

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
this is a sponge that has water on it so

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.359 
this is a sponge that has water on it so
you<00:00:30.029> can<00:00:30.330> take<00:00:30.570> off<00:00:30.779> any<00:00:31.019> melted<00:00:31.500> metal<00:00:31.800> and

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
you can take off any melted metal and

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.400 
you can take off any melted metal and
this<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.210> just<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.570> protective<00:00:34.110> ring<00:00:34.230> when

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
this is just the protective ring when

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.160 
this is just the protective ring when
it's<00:00:34.559> heating<00:00:34.860> up<00:00:35.210> so<00:00:36.210> this<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.630> usually<00:00:36.840> where

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
it's heating up so this is usually where

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.680 
it's heating up so this is usually where
I<00:00:37.230> keep<00:00:37.500> all<00:00:37.739> of<00:00:37.800> my<00:00:37.980> appliances<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.180> stuff<00:00:39.270> in

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
I keep all of my appliances and stuff in

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.459 
I keep all of my appliances and stuff in
is<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.829> battery<00:00:41.309> pack<00:00:42.020> usually<00:00:43.020> we're<00:00:43.170> working

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
is a battery pack usually we're working

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.440 
is a battery pack usually we're working
with<00:00:43.590> these<00:00:43.800> kinds<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.340> batteries<00:00:44.879> these<00:00:45.239> are

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
with these kinds of batteries these are

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.180 
with these kinds of batteries these are
the<00:00:45.539> best<00:00:45.750> kind<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.200> be<00:00:46.320> using<00:00:46.620> with<00:00:46.739> LEDs

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
the best kind to be using with LEDs

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.650 
the best kind to be using with LEDs
because<00:00:47.430> they<00:00:47.579> make<00:00:47.760> them<00:00:47.969> really<00:00:48.270> bright

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
because they make them really bright

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.660 
because they make them really bright
just<00:00:49.410> make<00:00:49.680> sure<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:49.920> you're<00:00:50.250> using<00:00:50.280> the

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
just make sure that you're using the

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.260 
just make sure that you're using the
right<00:00:51.000> kind<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:52.219> watts<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.520> stuff<00:00:53.820> when

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
right kind of watts and stuff when

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.229 
right kind of watts and stuff when
you're<00:00:54.690> using<00:00:54.960> you're<00:00:55.949> connecting<00:00:56.399> your<00:00:56.579> LEDs

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
you're using you're connecting your LEDs

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.860 
you're using you're connecting your LEDs
to<00:00:57.390> your<00:00:57.510> batteries<00:00:57.870> they<00:00:58.469> go<00:00:58.680> in<00:00:58.920> like<00:00:59.160> this

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
to your batteries they go in like this

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.740 
to your batteries they go in like this
so<00:01:00.870> what<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.350> will<00:01:01.680> need<00:01:02.300> where<00:01:03.300> you're<00:01:03.480> going

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
so what you will need where you're going

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.380 
so what you will need where you're going
to<00:01:03.870> put<00:01:04.110> your<00:01:04.320> LED<00:01:04.860> lights<00:01:05.129> your<00:01:05.880> soldering

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390

LEDs<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.619> already<00:01:13.890> have<00:01:14.070> mine<00:01:14.250> in<00:01:14.400> here<00:01:14.520> but

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
LEDs I already have mine in here but

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.480 
LEDs I already have mine in here but
here<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.180> an<00:01:15.390> LED<00:01:15.750> strip<00:01:17.630> batteries<00:01:19.490> how

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
here is an LED strip batteries how

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.370 
here is an LED strip batteries how
you're<00:01:20.700> connecting<00:01:21.240> your<00:01:21.390> batteries<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.229> your

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
you're connecting your batteries to your

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.219 
you're connecting your batteries to your
LEDs<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:25.040> electrical<00:01:26.040> wires<00:01:26.960> so<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.080> is

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
LEDs and electrical wires so this is

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.830 
LEDs and electrical wires so this is
basically<00:01:28.710> all<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.220> need<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.729> get<00:01:29.850> started<00:01:30.150> so

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
basically all you need to get started so

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.039 
basically all you need to get started so
this<00:01:31.619> is<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.979> inside<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.820> where<00:01:33.509> I'm<00:01:33.720> putting

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
this is the inside of where I'm putting

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.520 
this is the inside of where I'm putting
my<00:01:34.200> LED<00:01:34.619> lights<00:01:34.860> this<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.579> an<00:01:35.880> LED<00:01:36.329> strip<00:01:36.530> also

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
my LED lights this is an LED strip also

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.310 
my LED lights this is an LED strip also
in<00:01:38.159> this<00:01:38.400> section<00:01:38.640> here<00:01:39.030> there<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.630> an<00:01:39.930> LED

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
in this section here there is an LED

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.649 
in this section here there is an LED
strip<00:01:42.110> these<00:01:43.110> are<00:01:43.950> also<00:01:44.310> LEDs<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.090> are<00:01:45.360> in

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
strip these are also LEDs that are in

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.649 
strip these are also LEDs that are in
the<00:01:45.990> front<00:01:46.920> here<00:01:49.399> so<00:01:50.399> these<00:01:50.820> are<00:01:51.090> negative<00:01:51.329> and

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
the front here so these are negative and

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.139 
the front here so these are negative and
positive<00:01:52.020> wires<00:01:52.320> usually<00:01:53.009> these<00:01:53.220> wires<00:01:53.790> do

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
positive wires usually these wires do

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.819 
positive wires usually these wires do
not<00:01:54.299> come<00:01:54.570> attached<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.710> your<00:01:56.430> LED<00:01:57.090> strip<00:01:57.829> so

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
not come attached to your LED strip so

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.030 
not come attached to your LED strip so
these<00:01:59.100> are<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.460> LEDs<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.090> have<00:02:00.780> inside<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.530> here

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
these are the LEDs I have inside of here

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.609 
these are the LEDs I have inside of here
this<00:02:02.670> is<00:02:02.939> actually<00:02:03.420> an<00:02:03.509> LED<00:02:03.869> strip<00:02:03.930> which<00:02:04.409> has

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
this is actually an LED strip which has

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.800 
this is actually an LED strip which has
one<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:04.920> these<00:02:05.130> in<00:02:05.189> there<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:05.939> if<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.299> can<00:02:06.509> as

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
one of these in there and if you can as

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:07.860 
one of these in there and if you can as
you<00:02:07.049> can<00:02:07.259> see

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:07.870 
you can see

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.260 
you can see
there<00:02:08.200> is<00:02:08.590> a<00:02:08.619> positive<00:02:09.010> and<00:02:09.490> negative<00:02:09.880> symbol

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
there is a positive and negative symbol

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.390 
there is a positive and negative symbol
on<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:10.540> side<00:02:10.780> and<00:02:11.050> that<00:02:11.530> is<00:02:11.770> where<00:02:12.070> you<00:02:12.310> will

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
on the side and that is where you will

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.930 
on the side and that is where you will
be<00:02:12.550> attaching<00:02:12.970> your<00:02:13.720> electrical<00:02:14.620> wires<00:02:15.100> now

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
be attaching your electrical wires now

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.970 
be attaching your electrical wires now
the<00:02:16.000> electrical<00:02:16.540> wires<00:02:16.750> does<00:02:17.410> not<00:02:17.680> matter

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
the electrical wires does not matter

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.910 
the electrical wires does not matter
what<00:02:18.430> color<00:02:18.790> you<00:02:19.540> use<00:02:19.900> when<00:02:20.290> attaching<00:02:20.620> the

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
what color you use when attaching the

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.190 
what color you use when attaching the
positive<00:02:21.370> and<00:02:21.520> negatives<00:02:22.000> just<00:02:22.720> as<00:02:22.870> long<00:02:23.050> as

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
positive and negatives just as long as

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.200 
positive and negatives just as long as
you<00:02:23.350> know<00:02:23.500> what<00:02:23.740> color<00:02:24.040> is<00:02:24.310> which<00:02:24.610> so<00:02:24.940> you<00:02:24.970> do

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
you know what color is which so you do

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.900 
you know what color is which so you do
not<00:02:25.480> get<00:02:25.750> them<00:02:25.960> mixed<00:02:26.170> up<00:02:26.560> so<00:02:26.980> here<00:02:27.370> I<00:02:27.670> have

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
not get them mixed up so here I have

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.540 
not get them mixed up so here I have
already<00:02:28.210> soldered<00:02:29.140> on<00:02:29.320> my<00:02:29.950> positive<00:02:30.400> and

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
already soldered on my positive and

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.810 
already soldered on my positive and
negative<00:02:30.940> matches<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:32.680> best<00:02:32.890> way<00:02:33.070> to<00:02:33.100> test

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
negative matches the best way to test

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.720 
negative matches the best way to test
which<00:02:34.630> is<00:02:34.990> which<00:02:35.230> is<00:02:35.530> to<00:02:35.590> get<00:02:36.160> your<00:02:36.340> battery

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
which is which is to get your battery

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.750 
which is which is to get your battery
with<00:02:37.390> its<00:02:37.720> connectors<00:02:38.530> in<00:02:38.800> your<00:02:39.100> positive<00:02:39.610> and

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
with its connectors in your positive and

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.280 
with its connectors in your positive and
negative<00:02:40.140> usually<00:02:41.140> red<00:02:41.680> is<00:02:41.950> positive<00:02:42.760> and

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
negative usually red is positive and

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.920 
negative usually red is positive and
black<00:02:44.290> is<00:02:44.560> negative<00:02:48.090> so<00:02:49.090> what<00:02:49.390> we're<00:02:49.540> gonna<00:02:49.690> do

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
black is negative so what we're gonna do

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.990 
black is negative so what we're gonna do
is<00:02:50.110> just<00:02:50.140> to<00:02:50.680> test<00:02:50.920> it<00:02:51.240> connect<00:02:52.240> red<00:02:52.570> to<00:02:52.930> red

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
is just to test it connect red to red

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.410 
is just to test it connect red to red
connect<00:02:55.000> blue<00:02:55.360> to<00:02:55.660> black<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:57.010> there<00:02:57.940> we<00:02:58.060> go<00:02:58.240> as

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
connect blue to black and there we go as

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.820 
connect blue to black and there we go as
you<00:02:58.480> can<00:02:58.630> see<00:02:59.020> our<00:02:59.230> LEDs<00:02:59.860> are<00:03:00.310> shining<00:03:01.830> in

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
you can see our LEDs are shining in

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.750 
you can see our LEDs are shining in
order<00:03:03.280> to<00:03:03.490> get<00:03:03.760> your<00:03:04.450> wires<00:03:05.400> looking<00:03:06.400> like

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
order to get your wires looking like

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.270 
order to get your wires looking like
this<00:03:07.200> rather<00:03:08.200> than<00:03:08.410> looking<00:03:08.860> like<00:03:08.920> this

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
this rather than looking like this

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.979 
this rather than looking like this
always<00:03:09.760> best<00:03:10.180> to<00:03:10.330> have<00:03:10.450> a<00:03:11.130> wire<00:03:12.130> stripper<00:03:12.989> now

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
always best to have a wire stripper now

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.080 
always best to have a wire stripper now
with<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.380> wire<00:03:14.590> strippers<00:03:15.220> you<00:03:15.250> just<00:03:15.820> match

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
with the wire strippers you just match

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:25.310 
with the wire strippers you just match
up<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:17.070> size<00:03:18.070> of<00:03:18.489> your<00:03:19.120> wire<00:03:20.850> to<00:03:21.850> the<00:03:22.810> section

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
up the size of your wire to the section

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.840 
up the size of your wire to the section
pass<00:03:26.320> it<00:03:26.560> down<00:03:26.770> and<00:03:28.800> just<00:03:29.800> pull<00:03:30.100> like<00:03:30.130> that<00:03:30.310> and

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
pass it down and just pull like that and

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.470 
pass it down and just pull like that and
then<00:03:31.420> you<00:03:31.600> will<00:03:31.780> get<00:03:31.930> your<00:03:32.230> wire<00:03:32.950> and<00:03:33.370> this<00:03:34.209> is

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
then you will get your wire and this is

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.940 
then you will get your wire and this is
what<00:03:34.690> we<00:03:34.840> will<00:03:34.989> attach<00:03:35.320> to<00:03:35.680> the<00:03:37.739> negative<00:03:38.739> and

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
what we will attach to the negative and

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:48.640 
what we will attach to the negative and
positive<00:03:39.040> wires

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:04:15.220 

you

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:21.440

but<00:05:47.860> once<00:05:48.069> you<00:05:48.249> finish<00:05:48.639> solder<00:05:49.180> and

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
but once you finish solder and

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.269 
but once you finish solder and
everything<00:05:49.930> you<00:05:50.740> should<00:05:50.800> have<00:05:51.039> something

00:05:51.269 --> 00:05:51.279 
everything you should have something

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:55.679 
everything you should have something
that<00:05:51.580> looks<00:05:51.939> like<00:05:52.419> this<00:05:53.039> so<00:05:54.089> we<00:05:55.089> have<00:05:55.119> a<00:05:55.330> button
