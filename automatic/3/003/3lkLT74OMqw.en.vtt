00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.680

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.669
 in short , you have also seen you will see 

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:56.020
 always that I bought recently 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:58.270
 still believe in commerce 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.949
 i want this shirt that still roms 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.649
 but this is old bought like the year 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:04.680
 last and it is one begins with this 

00:05:02.649 --> 00:05:07.240
 big collar was called type 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.639
 rabbit collar such a thing 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.169
 and then this one here that a jersey instead 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.779
 to use that I bought the balances 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:15.399
 last year and I owe it 

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:18.159
 in fact iron before share mida 

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:21.369
 back the shirt on and to this 

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:23.740
 dark gray but a rim seems to be bending 

00:05:21.369 --> 00:05:26.020
 instead the strong behind Magliana but 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.839
 I think, however, this shirt that I am 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.149
 anyway, it serves as a da golino for 

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:33.399
 close the shirt here the shirt is from 

00:05:31.149 --> 00:05:35.919
 transparent fabric but not so much 

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:38.619
 is interested in how that bag will give you to 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:40.930
 order twisted shoulder the relationship the 

00:05:38.619 --> 00:05:43.749
 I bring it this way because it is still a bit laid 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:46.839
 like as a loop that in the shoulder strap I don't 

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:50.319
 we would like and therefore this one here that 

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:53.589
 he paid her 19 euros from Zara now I have 

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:55.779
