00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.190
 did a 1350 ride that one of the ways to 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.670
 city ​​to 229 million so that's 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.470
 unsaleable 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.080

 so that's the first tip cd hood of a 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:20.010
 second word trick this is it 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.790
 territory asks for ponies

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.079
 besides these three hundred thousand leaving 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:41.340
 So me I feel like I take HDV 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:45.180
 it's pretty easy to find that it's 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:48.650
 easy except washed hdv and that too 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:52.169
 in the end we win we win a lot of 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.040
 nice profits during it's ugly 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:55.590
 if windows 8 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.040

 in one week so 1600 x between 30,000 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.810
 cabba that's 48 million so that's it 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.139
 it's always nice in one 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.359

 48th good of the 48 you may have 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:11.500
 removed 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.299
 15th in buying resources so 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.049
 you will still have a good 30 million 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:19.450
 bep 9 so here you go 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.010
 then down for now I excel 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.519
 camo tricks but it's just very 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.550
 enough I could redo myself a stuff in 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.830
 May a week is 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:32.250

 even auger no church east so 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.740
 Here we go broke contracts 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.220
 this is it until tomorrow simply 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:45.320
 laid down net deposits in the boot zones 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:51.370

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:51.370
 the discord or territory of ango a 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.650
 for 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.790

 shit I should not have left the 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.360
 calculator 2354 the beautiful the percentage 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.060
 to have a bm is that a sport on 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.160
 so we do divided by 100 votes 15 so 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:16.310
 it's all logically about 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:19.310
 350 350 ppm street in a week eleven 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.310
 nice 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.070
 I opened everything at the end 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.420
 I learned to have prime pm May 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.870
 personally I keep them 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.870
 exactions 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.490
 or gennannies with pap m6 young man 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:02.599
 very quickly since young people in 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:06.830
 capeps forget that the items that must 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:08.240
 to sell the fastest to the game I 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.750
 not even give an era of hope of 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.750
 life in hd 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.600
 but it's not a camatte trick 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.170
 young people at the club since usually 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:20.060
 meetings are expensive you have a 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.560
 chance on 100 breastslpm the gel named 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.600
 rhdp at midway the third is the heroine 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.849
 pm are 4th so really rare of the 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:31.969
 song succeed in spending two years would have 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:33.860
 but statistically it's beneficial 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:37.089
 so we'll see how many runes 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.089
 it made me 

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:44.349
 317 well here it is rather good it is in 

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:48.669
 below average 

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:51.480
 but that's not 110 to be worth 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:54.470
 special tv 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:58.590
 4 million lé Walloon sense 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:06:00.780

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:04.520
 potions of perco that 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.520
 keira mother who brings a lot 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:19.599
 that's it with my brain is increasing and 

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:19.599
 it's interesting 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:27.250
 here is a little tip kama after 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.210

 hate the boots are perco 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:33.780
 interesting could lay here loose of 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:36.190
 coral mining villages super expensive costs 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:40.050
 registered this trail it must be 70 miles 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:42.520

 there are 700 700 passes of 700 times not 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:52.270
 this time it's 70 it goes up fast enough 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:56.710
 after there may be there territories of 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:59.680
