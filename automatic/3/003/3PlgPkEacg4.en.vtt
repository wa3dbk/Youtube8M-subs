the water inside the tank everything

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.750 
the water inside the tank everything
just<00:00:41.430> seems<00:00:41.700> so<00:00:41.969> much<00:00:42.270> clearer<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:43.610> you<00:00:44.610> know

the fish seem to really like having it
there<00:00:47.780> it<00:00:48.780> took<00:00:49.140> me<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.289> couple<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.559> weeks<00:00:49.620> to

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
there it took me a couple of weeks to

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.080 
there it took me a couple of weeks to
get<00:00:50.010> one<00:00:50.250> because<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.700> didn't<00:00:50.940> necessarily

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
get one because I didn't necessarily

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.110 
get one because I didn't necessarily
need<00:00:51.570> one<00:00:51.870> use<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.260> filter<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.800> I've<00:00:52.920> got

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
need one use the filter that I've got

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.330 
need one use the filter that I've got
but<00:00:54.120> I've<00:00:54.300> added<00:00:54.629> one<00:00:54.890> just<00:00:55.890> for<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.100> fishes

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
but I've added one just for the fishes

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.040 
but I've added one just for the fishes
benefit<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.360> think<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.660> looks<00:00:57.840> stunning

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
benefit and I think it looks stunning

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.849 
benefit and I think it looks stunning
now<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:59.180> so<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.719> couple<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.410> things<00:01:01.590> that's

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
now and so a couple of things that's

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.070 
now and so a couple of things that's
worth<00:01:02.100> mentioning<00:01:02.309> on<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.210> box<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.660> does<00:01:03.840> say

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
worth mentioning on the box it does say

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.730 
worth mentioning on the box it does say
this<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.890> silent<00:01:05.430> aquarium<00:01:06.210> air<00:01:06.330> pump<00:01:06.740> well

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
this is a silent aquarium air pump well

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.399 
this is a silent aquarium air pump well
I've<00:01:07.860> got<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.040> over<00:01:08.189> here<00:01:11.840> I'm<00:01:12.840> sure<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.260> can

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
the tank just over here and the echo

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.609 
the tank just over here and the echo
from<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.880> buzz<00:01:29.880> just<00:01:30.240> amplified<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.380> was

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
noticeable at all if you're you know

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.090 
noticeable at all if you're you know
watching<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.200> television<00:01:40.740> or<00:01:42.049> you<00:01:43.049> know<00:01:43.200> just

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
watching the television or you know just

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.380 
watching the television or you know just
just<00:01:44.159> day-to-day<00:01:44.790> it's<00:01:44.939> not<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.240> noticeable

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
just day-to-day it's not that noticeable

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.179 
just day-to-day it's not that noticeable
unless<00:01:45.840> you're<00:01:46.200> really<00:01:46.470> listening<00:01:46.619> for<00:01:47.070> it

but don't think you can hide around the
back<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.860> tank<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:51.680> you<00:01:52.680> know<00:01:52.829> not<00:01:53.009> hear<00:01:53.310> it
