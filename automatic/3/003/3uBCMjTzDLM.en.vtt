by the end of the 1920s Ford is almost
on<00:04:35.500> the<00:04:35.530> brink<00:04:35.710> of<00:04:36.190> going<00:04:36.460> out<00:04:36.700> of<00:04:36.730> business

while GM is triumphant and this is

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.740 
while GM is triumphant and this is
largely<00:04:40.720> because<00:04:41.020> of<00:04:41.790> how<00:04:42.790> they<00:04:43.090> differently

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750
