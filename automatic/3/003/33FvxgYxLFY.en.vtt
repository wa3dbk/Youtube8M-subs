turn scoreboard on for all I care but
you<00:01:07.229> know<00:01:07.350> because<00:01:07.500> coaches<00:01:07.890> are<00:01:08.010> just

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
you know because coaches are just

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.950 
you know because coaches are just
interested<00:01:08.400> in<00:01:08.640> evaluating<00:01:09.060> their<00:01:09.450> personnel

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
interested in evaluating their personnel

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.760 
interested in evaluating their personnel
and<00:01:10.610> seeing<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.760> competitive<00:01:12.299> spirit<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.619> so

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
and seeing the competitive spirit and so

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.490 
and seeing the competitive spirit and so
sometimes<00:01:14.360> to<00:01:15.360> go<00:01:15.509> against<00:01:15.810> another<00:01:16.020> team<00:01:16.229> it

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
sometimes to go against another team it

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.080 
sometimes to go against another team it
would<00:01:16.619> be<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:16.770> think<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.130> great<00:01:17.369> option<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.909> then

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
would be I think a great option and then

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.330 
would be I think a great option and then
also<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.840> know<00:01:19.380> when<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.710> scrimmage<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.250> a

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
breath whereas you know when you you're

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.819 
breath whereas you know when you you're
only<00:01:30.570> have<00:01:30.840> invested<00:01:31.409> when<00:01:31.560> you're<00:01:31.680> playing

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
only have invested when you're playing

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.200 
only have invested when you're playing
another<00:01:32.130> team<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:32.729> think<00:01:32.939> from<00:01:33.180> that

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
another team so I think from that

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.330 
another team so I think from that
standpoint<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:34.380> would<00:01:34.530> be<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.710> lot<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:34.890> fun<00:01:35.009> and

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
standpoint it would be a lot of fun and

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.859 
standpoint it would be a lot of fun and
you<00:01:35.430> could<00:01:35.610> create<00:01:35.820> some<00:01:36.060> revenue<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:36.689> there's

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
you could create some revenue so there's

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.090 
you could create some revenue so there's
a<00:01:36.960> lot<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.140> positives<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:37.770> don't<00:01:37.920> know<00:01:38.009> if

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
a lot of positives I don't know if

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.890 
a lot of positives I don't know if
that'll<00:01:38.220> ever<00:01:38.460> happen<00:01:38.549> but<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.270> think

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
that'll ever happen but I think

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.660 
that'll ever happen but I think
certainly<00:01:40.470> something<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:41.310> we<00:01:41.490> should

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
certainly something that that we should

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.550 
certainly something that that we should
look<00:01:41.759> at<00:01:41.939> real<00:01:42.570> quickly<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:43.020> want<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.409> talk
