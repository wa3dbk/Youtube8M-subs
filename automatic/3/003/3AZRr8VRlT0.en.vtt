the point where it actually doesn't feel
good<00:01:15.390> look<00:01:15.720> feel<00:01:15.930> like<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.200> can<00:01:16.320> hold<00:01:16.470> on<00:01:16.680> to

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
it three on the common side would be the

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.320 
it three on the common side would be the
fact<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:21.110> you<00:01:22.110> can't<00:01:22.530> really<00:01:22.680> get<00:01:23.369> some<00:01:24.210> of

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.270 
like the the weather and the clock would
you<00:01:38.000> and<00:01:39.000> others<00:01:39.780> other<00:01:40.140> launchers<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.829> so

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
you and others other launchers and so

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.249 
you and others other launchers and so
you<00:01:41.790> get<00:01:42.000> other<00:01:42.240> lodgers<00:01:42.540> put<00:01:42.930> them<00:01:43.049> on<00:01:43.170> the

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
you get other lodgers put them on the

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.020 
you get other lodgers put them on the
device<00:01:43.590> but<00:01:44.130> then<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.310> have<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.490> try<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.759> come

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
device but then you have to try to come

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.700 
device but then you have to try to come
up<00:01:45.060> with<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.329> way<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.570> get<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:45.990> same<00:01:46.259> look<00:01:46.290> and

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
up with a way to get that same look and

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.179 
up with a way to get that same look and
feel<00:01:46.799> oh<00:01:47.280> it's<00:01:47.909> not<00:01:48.119> HTC's<00:01:48.750> fault<00:01:49.170> but<00:01:49.500> i<00:01:49.680> think

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
feel oh it's not HTC's fault but i think

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.359 
feel oh it's not HTC's fault but i think
they<00:01:50.970> tie<00:01:51.329> everything<00:01:51.720> in<00:01:52.079> so<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:53.280> know

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
they tie everything in so you know

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.639 
they tie everything in so you know
tightly<00:01:54.210> integrated<00:01:54.720> until<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.320> where<00:01:55.530> you

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
tightly integrated until you where you

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.380 
tightly integrated until you where you
can't<00:01:55.979> slice<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.549> dice<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.909> pieces<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.240> you

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
can't slice and dice the pieces that you

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.440 
can't slice and dice the pieces that you
like<00:01:57.780> i<00:01:58.079> personally<00:01:58.829> didn't<00:01:59.640> use<00:01:59.850> blinkfeed

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
like i personally didn't use blinkfeed

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.569 
like i personally didn't use blinkfeed
that<00:02:00.719> much<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.140> playing<00:02:01.380> around<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.860> was<00:02:01.979> nice<00:02:02.250> I

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
that much I playing around it was nice I

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.520 
that much I playing around it was nice I
don't<00:02:02.939> see<00:02:03.090> why<00:02:03.299> they<00:02:03.479> can't<00:02:03.810> allow<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.259> to

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
don't see why they can't allow you to

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.860 
don't see why they can't allow you to
break<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:04.950> up

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
break that up

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.130 
break that up
on<00:02:06.870> the<00:02:07.140> pro<00:02:07.890> side<00:02:08.220> device<00:02:09.180> is<00:02:09.420> very<00:02:09.450> very

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
on the pro side device is very very

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.100 
on the pro side device is very very
cleanly<00:02:10.950> designed<00:02:11.420> even<00:02:12.420> though<00:02:12.540> it's<00:02:12.870> not

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
cleanly designed even though it's not

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.560 
cleanly designed even though it's not
comfortable<00:02:13.470> to<00:02:13.770> hold<00:02:13.980> in<00:02:14.250> some<00:02:14.910> are<00:02:15.120> but<00:02:15.300> look

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
comfortable to hold in some are but look

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.410 
comfortable to hold in some are but look
at<00:02:15.840> oh<00:02:16.080> I<00:02:16.890> can't<00:02:17.520> say<00:02:17.700> enough<00:02:17.730> about<00:02:17.970> their

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
at oh I can't say enough about their

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.390 
at oh I can't say enough about their
their<00:02:18.780> ability<00:02:19.350> to<00:02:19.380> actually<00:02:19.710> design<00:02:20.340> a

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
their ability to actually design a

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.540 
their ability to actually design a
device<00:02:20.670> that's<00:02:20.880> really<00:02:21.810> really<00:02:21.990> nice<00:02:22.370> even<00:02:23.370> so

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
device that's really really nice even so

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.980 
device that's really really nice even so
much<00:02:23.730> so<00:02:23.940> on<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.180> status<00:02:24.540> of<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.750> apple

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
much so on the status of the apple

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.760 
much so on the status of the apple
iphone<00:02:25.220> number<00:02:26.220> two<00:02:26.640> would<00:02:27.060> be<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.390> sound<00:02:27.770> the

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
iphone number two would be the sound the

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.820 
iphone number two would be the sound the
sound<00:02:29.130> is<00:02:29.580> amazing<00:02:29.880> and<00:02:30.720> I<00:02:31.380> think<00:02:31.650> all

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
sound is amazing and I think all

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.010 
sound is amazing and I think all
manufacturers<00:02:32.670> should<00:02:32.790> have<00:02:33.600> to<00:02:33.840> make<00:02:33.990> a

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
manufacturers should have to make a

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.290 
manufacturers should have to make a
device<00:02:34.440> where<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.430> speakers<00:02:35.880> are<00:02:36.000> getting<00:02:36.210> on

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
device where the speakers are getting on

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.930 
device where the speakers are getting on
the<00:02:36.390> front<00:02:36.750> or<00:02:37.260> on<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.620> bottom<00:02:38.010> it<00:02:38.520> just<00:02:38.730> makes

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
the front or on the bottom it just makes

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.270 
the front or on the bottom it just makes
sense<00:02:39.060> having<00:02:39.750> a<00:02:39.840> speaker<00:02:40.170> on<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.350> back<00:02:40.470> does

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
sense having a speaker on the back does

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.370 
sense having a speaker on the back does
not<00:02:41.310> make<00:02:41.970> sense<00:02:42.000> we're<00:02:42.690> going<00:02:42.840> for<00:02:43.050> super

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
not make sense we're going for super

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.650 
not make sense we're going for super
thin<00:02:43.620> and<00:02:44.070> no<00:02:44.520> one's<00:02:44.730> trying<00:02:44.940> to<00:02:45.030> have<00:02:45.209> any

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
thin and no one's trying to have any

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.420 
thin and no one's trying to have any
bumps<00:02:46.200> or<00:02:46.320> anything<00:02:46.680> on<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:46.920> device<00:02:47.220> so

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
bumps or anything on the device so

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.620 
bumps or anything on the device so
there's<00:02:47.610> really<00:02:47.730> nothing<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.240> create<00:02:48.600> a

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
there's really nothing to create a

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.949 
there's really nothing to create a
cavity<00:02:49.080> for<00:02:49.290> sound<00:02:49.560> this<00:02:50.190> thing<00:02:50.430> sounds

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
cavity for sound this thing sounds

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.830 
cavity for sound this thing sounds
amazing<00:02:52.100> third<00:02:53.100> pro<00:02:53.490> would<00:02:53.850> be<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.450> screen

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
amazing third pro would be the screen

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.030 
amazing third pro would be the screen
the<00:02:55.080> screen<00:02:55.230> is<00:02:55.740> actually<00:02:55.980> super<00:02:56.760> super<00:02:57.480> nice

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
the screen is actually super super nice

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.470 
the screen is actually super super nice
you<00:02:59.040> know<00:02:59.130> they<00:02:59.280> didn't<00:02:59.520> give<00:02:59.640> a<00:02:59.670> soft<00:03:00.030> button

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
you know they didn't give a soft button

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.850 
you know they didn't give a soft button
so<00:03:00.690> i<00:03:00.750> can<00:03:00.959> used<00:03:01.170> to<00:03:01.320> with<00:03:01.470> something<00:03:01.740> like<00:03:01.830> a

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
so i can used to with something like a

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.910 
so i can used to with something like a
nexus<00:03:02.250> 4<00:03:02.490> I<00:03:02.760> put<00:03:03.090> that<00:03:03.120> terrible<00:03:03.750> HTC<00:03:04.230> logo<00:03:04.440> in

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
nexus 4 I put that terrible HTC logo in

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.380 
nexus 4 I put that terrible HTC logo in
the<00:03:05.130> way<00:03:05.280> which<00:03:05.550> really<00:03:05.850> should<00:03:05.970> have<00:03:06.209> been

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
the way which really should have been

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.470 
the way which really should have been
another<00:03:07.290> button<00:03:07.620> in<00:03:07.770> my<00:03:07.920> opinion<00:03:08.220> but<00:03:08.490> the

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
another button in my opinion but the

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.449 
another button in my opinion but the
screen<00:03:10.050> is<00:03:10.170> is<00:03:10.560> one<00:03:10.860> of<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.040> best<00:03:11.220> screens
