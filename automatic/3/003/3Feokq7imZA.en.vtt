00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.639
 hello welcome one more day a week che 

00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:05.620
 I bring you gameplay in terminal playing 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:07.270
 a team duel with the acr without 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.429
 muffler I wear it with red dot and 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:12.790
 large loaders I carry gusts of 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:14.170
 assault as they are the v the predictor and the and 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.060
 the helicopter but normally as 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.010
 you see in the title the currency is man 

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.750
 championing as you see in the title I'm going to 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.570
 talk about the black ops gusts on 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.830
 the system of gusts of black ops 2 that 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.190
 you have asked me one that you have 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.780
 said explain us what I do not assure you 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.300
 that is that it does not take out of doubts and others 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.040
 Well, the fact is that there is a double low 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.780
 the fact is that as you know in modern 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.880
 warfare 3 is a system of points a 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.400
 system in which you do not kill a person 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.080
 you get one point you kill another one and if you 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.910
 you take a flag or do anything 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.850
 of the goal set here with him with the 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.860
 project failing if you take any 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.930
 anything from the objective that one 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.870
 flag or you put a bomb gives you another 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:56.710
 point has to happen with this really 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.690
 have decided that they have thought that it is not 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.020
 right under my point of view it is also not 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.379
 just that the same points are given 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.750
 of streak in a way 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.810
 I mean, you give the same thing to kill a 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.510
 domain shot that kill a guy in 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.190
 team duel is worth then what is 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.630
 what happens that does not prevail to 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.270
 catch the goal no matter how much that 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.800
 first that you have tried to take first 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.960
 a domain flag with a dot is 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.880
 easier to kill a guy because good is 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.890
 simpler than having a point is to catch 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.590
 the initial flag and then you pass the 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.910
 theme they have done in black ops 2 veis 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.040
 here for example that they give us 100 points 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.390
 by death we are playing domain that 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.600
 you get 100 points for death in black 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.610
 ops 2 are 50 but the good thing is to catch 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.119
 a blank flag all counts 150 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:46.390
 points kill a person 50 who have 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.160
 done with the low runs that are 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.399
 They are now gusting casualties 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:54.310
 gusting point it is lower than 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.619
 you need points for example for the rfc 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.200
 that the countries the radio control car 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.950
 a car that you drive them and then you 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.039
 cagas 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.649
 the enemy costs 325 is the most streak 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:08.640
 low is therefore worth the system of 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:11.620
 score that has black ops 2 would be 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:16.000
 catch a flag 150 points worth 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.489
 then you would have 175 to get the 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.410
 rfc that is to say you take another flag and you 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:26.260
 you stay at 300 or you take one you take one 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.180
 flag and you kill it really 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.370
 taking a flag would be 150 points 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.980
 so kill a person would be 200 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.069
 kill two more and three will be 300 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:40.209
 that is to say we are say every three casualties 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:43.810
 in domain of black ops will be as 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:46.060
 capture a flag I imagine that what 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.519
 will modify and put 100 points to choose 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.430
 a flag but I do not know that that does not 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:53.500
 I know it's my assumptions but not what 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.910
 it is in the case but the gusts go 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.079
 for the points we get here in 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.510
 heading as you are seeing here by 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:01.150
 double example lower more would be in that 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.519
 game over 200 here another plus 50 would be 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.470
 then you go probas getting 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.420
 low depending on that 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.220
 and now you will ask yourselves there are 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.900
 many many many questions 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.820
 unknowns not for example what happens with 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.260
 the double points has been said clearly 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.540
 that with the double points is not going to be 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.010
 let's say twice as easy to get 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.390
 the streak but simply that they 're going 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.280
 to give the points at the end of the game 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.660
 and they're not going to tell us 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.670
 the streak thing that seems normal to me is 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.230
 say it will put you on screen for over 200 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.300
 but it's as if I had more than 100 da 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.940
 but nothing will say only that 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.350
 at the end of the game you will get more points 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.730
 more more questions that can arise 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.350
 what came to me came to me 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.940
 How will the line work? 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.270
 hard then not because the hard line 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.850
 is and what you are going to do is reduce or not 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:45.340
 you know if you reduce the cost of gusts 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.870
 or increase the points that I give you 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.700
 I imagine that they will reduce the cost of 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.070
 streaks not to mess it up too much because 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.810
 if not on the screen you would get more 75 and 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.920
 Things like that marc very rare things do not 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:59.620
 So then, as I say, I hope that 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.570
 you understand it, not that I take you out of doubt is 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.310
 just just instead of working with 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:07.600
 a point two points three points works 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.980
 with 325 of the car 375 the uve 400 the 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.420
 hunter kill that is like a kind of 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.930
 boomerang that exploits fixed and always 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.409
 here that does not kill me 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.239
 in the counter low to the counterintelligence 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:18.500
 475 and so a lot of gusts that I'm going to 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.329
 leave a link in the description with a 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.430
 link that you have already seen many 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:25.039
 but the case is that does not work of that 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.509
 way to get points the points that 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:27.889
 they get in games they serve for the 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:30.020
 streak yes clear depending on a mode of 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:32.570
 game or another one because they will give you more 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.039
 points or has not been seen also that in 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.410
 search and destroy because of course if not in 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:37.250
 search and destroy 500 points remain 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.169
 burrada 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.180
 for example in this game it would be very 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.650
 easy to get a streak 500 points and 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.870
 we would already have a guardian a turret 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.720
 guardian has been spotted ay double 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:51.020
 low it has been said that it will not be so 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:53.810
 has seen that they are 50 points for killed 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.759
 push and destroy I also hope that 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:59.659
 change it is to say that they change the form 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:05:01.879
 to score because 50 points are search and 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:04.940
 destroy at least that I stay in 

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:07.069
 100 for the gusts but there are 500 as 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.500
 always for the point to gd or for the 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:11.060
 score to level up not then 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.319
 what I said, I repeat it again because 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:17.569
 Sometimes the confusion is a little messy 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:19.400
 low runs per starting point is 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:21.530
 say for points to capture flags 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.419
 would be 150 and other stories that is why 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.759
 example here you see 150 then these points 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:29.539
 that would give us for the streak would be 150 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:32.389
 and what I say points 375 325 a 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:33.680
 lots of rare score points and 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:35.330
 nothing will leave you the link in the description 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.740
 I hope you liked the game my 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.539
 first game on the channel I think without 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:42.039
 silencer that is not extreme and nothing 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:42.039
 see you in the next video a greeting
