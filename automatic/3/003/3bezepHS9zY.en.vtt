but in this video I'll be going over

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.720 
but in this video I'll be going over
basically<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.119> only<00:00:24.680> somewhat<00:00:25.680> complex<00:00:26.400> part

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
basically the only somewhat complex part

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.609 
basically the only somewhat complex part
of<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.939> game<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.359> rest<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:28.050> main<00:00:28.260> point<00:00:28.529> of

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
of the game the rest the main point of

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.560 
of the game the rest the main point of
the<00:00:28.740> game<00:00:28.859> is<00:00:28.980> pretty<00:00:29.010> simple<00:00:29.250> but<00:00:29.820> except<00:00:30.539> for

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
the game is pretty simple but except for

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.170 
the game is pretty simple but except for
this<00:00:30.869> so<00:00:33.860> the<00:00:34.860> only<00:00:34.890> crafting<00:00:35.610> items<00:00:35.760> that

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
this so the only crafting items that

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.440 
this so the only crafting items that
need<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.390> be<00:00:36.630> upgraded<00:00:36.960> are<00:00:37.760> pick<00:00:38.760> axes<00:00:39.210> and

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
need to be upgraded are pick axes and

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.260 
need to be upgraded are pick axes and
swords<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.710> reason<00:00:41.070> pick<00:00:41.340> axes<00:00:41.760> need<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.149> be

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
swords the reason pick axes need to be

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.740 
swords the reason pick axes need to be
upgraded<00:00:42.870> over<00:00:42.989> time<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.800> because

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
upgraded over time and is because

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.420 
upgraded over time and is because
basically<00:00:45.750> if<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.500> have<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.710> higher<00:00:47.070> level

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
basically if you have a higher level

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.180 
basically if you have a higher level
pickaxe<00:00:47.969> such<00:00:48.239> as<00:00:48.480> iron<00:00:49.200> pickaxe<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:49.890> can

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
pickaxe such as iron pickaxe you can

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.630 
pickaxe such as iron pickaxe you can
mine<00:00:50.520> more<00:00:50.910> items<00:00:51.899> such<00:00:52.260> as<00:00:52.289> like<00:00:52.770> diamond<00:00:53.340> or

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
mine more items such as like diamond or

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.990 
mine more items such as like diamond or
whatever<00:00:55.010> the<00:00:56.010> reason<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.460> would<00:00:56.610> want<00:00:56.879> to

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
whatever the reason you would want to

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.049 
whatever the reason you would want to
upgrade<00:00:57.739> weapons<00:00:58.739> such<00:00:59.250> as<00:00:59.280> swords<00:00:59.609> he

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
upgrade weapons such as swords he

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.549 
upgrade weapons such as swords he
actually<00:01:00.539> that's<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.930> only<00:01:00.960> weapon<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.379> can

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
actually that's the only weapon you can

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.260 
actually that's the only weapon you can
trade<00:01:01.859> but<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.609> reason<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.149> would<00:01:03.239> want

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
trade but the reason you would want

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.690 
trade but the reason you would want
upgrade<00:01:03.840> swords<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.409> because<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.519> higher

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
upgrade swords is because the higher

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.750 
upgrade swords is because the higher
level<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.689> sword<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.189> better<00:01:08.400> chance

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
level the sword is the better chance

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.600 
level the sword is the better chance
you'll<00:01:09.030> have<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.299> killing<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.080> mob<00:01:10.260> if<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.369> run

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
you'll have of killing a mob if you run

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.460 
you'll have of killing a mob if you run
into<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.909> mob<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.600> don't<00:01:12.780> kill<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.229> you

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
into a mob and you don't kill it you

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.760 
into a mob and you don't kill it you
basically<00:01:14.100> die<00:01:14.310> if<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.330> die<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.600> either<00:01:16.290> lose

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
basically die if you die you either lose

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.310 
basically die if you die you either lose
all<00:01:17.100> your<00:01:17.310> resources<00:01:17.880> or<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.659> lose<00:01:18.869> all<00:01:19.170> your

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
all your resources or you lose all your

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.160 
all your resources or you lose all your
resources<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:20.130> crafting<00:01:20.759> items<00:01:20.880> which<00:01:21.840> sucks

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
resources and crafting items which sucks

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.050 
resources and crafting items which sucks
but<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.439> once<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:25.979> score<00:01:26.250> achievement<00:01:26.759> cards

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
but you once you score achievement cards

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.819 
but you once you score achievement cards
so<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.210> keep<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.630> cards<00:01:27.990> until<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.500> end<00:01:28.680> of

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
so you keep the cards until the end of

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.819 
so you keep the cards until the end of
the<00:01:28.920> game<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.340> can't<00:01:29.579> really<00:01:29.790> lose<00:01:30.060> them

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
the game and you can't really lose them

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:34.190 
the game and you can't really lose them
all<00:01:31.829> right<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.220> let's<00:01:32.490> say<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:32.700> have<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.240> sword

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
all right so let's say I have a sword

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.450 
all right so let's say I have a sword
and<00:01:34.880> pickaxe<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:37.439> choose<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.740> go<00:01:38.100> into<00:01:38.340> the

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
and pickaxe and I choose to go into the

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.440 
and pickaxe and I choose to go into the
cave<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:39.350> let's<00:01:40.350> say<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.500> have<00:01:41.040> cobblestone<00:01:41.670> so

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
cave I let's say I have cobblestone so

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.620 
cave I let's say I have cobblestone so
that<00:01:42.630> means<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:43.140> have<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.970> cobblestone<00:01:44.970> pickaxe

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
that means I have a cobblestone pickaxe

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.719 
that means I have a cobblestone pickaxe
and<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.930> cobblestone<00:01:46.350> sword<00:01:47.930> and<00:01:49.040> if<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.220> if<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.549> go

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
and a cobblestone sword and if I if I go

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.730 
and a cobblestone sword and if I if I go
into<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.030> cave<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.780> first<00:01:52.049> item<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.680> a

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
into the cave and the first item is a

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.139 
into the cave and the first item is a
coal<00:01:53.810> I<00:01:54.810> could<00:01:55.680> pick<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:55.920> up<00:01:56.159> because<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.880> says

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
coal I could pick it up because it says

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.020 
coal I could pick it up because it says
requires<00:01:57.810> stone<00:01:58.619> iron<00:01:59.040> or<00:01:59.340> diamond<00:01:59.490> pickaxe

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
requires stone iron or diamond pickaxe

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.260 
requires stone iron or diamond pickaxe
to<00:02:00.240> mine<00:02:00.390> this<00:02:00.719> or<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:02.070> means<00:02:02.310> just<00:02:03.000> any

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
to mine this or so that means just any

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.760 
to mine this or so that means just any
pickaxe<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.930> have<00:02:04.140> will<00:02:04.409> be<00:02:04.530> sufficient<00:02:06.049> so<00:02:07.049> I

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
pickaxe you have will be sufficient so I

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.270 
pickaxe you have will be sufficient so I
use<00:02:08.310> my<00:02:08.550> stone<00:02:09.440> pickaxe<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.590> pick<00:02:10.950> up<00:02:11.129> this

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
use my stone pickaxe to pick up this

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.130 
use my stone pickaxe to pick up this
card<00:02:11.580> so<00:02:12.239> now

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
card so now

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.730 
card so now
Cole<00:02:14.120> now<00:02:15.120> let's<00:02:15.300> say<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.720> next<00:02:15.959> turn<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:16.319> go<00:02:16.680> to

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
Cole now let's say the next turn I go to

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.809 
Cole now let's say the next turn I go to
the<00:02:16.980> cave<00:02:17.220> again<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:18.380> I<00:02:19.380> run<00:02:19.650> into<00:02:20.040> a<00:02:20.430> spider

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
the cave again and I run into a spider

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.790 
the cave again and I run into a spider
so<00:02:22.430> it<00:02:23.430> says<00:02:23.670> over<00:02:23.850> here<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.480> moms<00:02:24.900> can<00:02:25.290> mouth

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
so it says over here the moms can mouth

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.870 
so it says over here the moms can mouth
drops<00:02:26.280> or

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
determined do a die I die all right so I

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.759 
determined do a die I die all right so I
have<00:02:46.739> a<00:02:47.010> cobblestone<00:02:47.489> sword<00:02:48.090> so<00:02:48.989> if<00:02:49.380> you<00:02:49.560> look

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
have a cobblestone sword so if you look

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.229 
have a cobblestone sword so if you look
here<00:02:49.800> it<00:02:50.280> will<00:02:50.340> say<00:02:50.700> a<00:02:52.220> stone<00:02:53.220> sword<00:02:53.640> you<00:02:54.000> have

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
here it will say a stone sword you have

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.690 
here it will say a stone sword you have
to<00:02:54.450> roll<00:02:54.810> lower<00:02:55.170> than<00:02:55.440> three<00:02:55.800> in<00:02:56.040> order<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.489> hit

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
to roll lower than three in order to hit

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.380 
to roll lower than three in order to hit
so<00:02:57.510> if<00:02:57.870> I<00:02:58.080> if<00:02:58.590> I<00:02:58.769> roll<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.040> two<00:02:59.459> then<00:02:59.850> I<00:03:00.150> could

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
so if I if I roll a two then I could

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.040 
so if I if I roll a two then I could
kill<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:00.840> spider<00:03:01.110> if<00:03:01.860> I<00:03:02.010> roll<00:03:02.310> a<00:03:02.610> six<00:03:02.780> then<00:03:03.780> the

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
kill the spider if I roll a six then the

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.870 
kill the spider if I roll a six then the
spider<00:03:04.290> killed<00:03:04.709> me<00:03:04.860> and<00:03:05.100> I<00:03:05.430> would<00:03:05.550> have<00:03:05.580> to

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
spider killed me and I would have to

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.610 
spider killed me and I would have to
leave<00:03:06.060> drop<00:03:06.450> all<00:03:06.660> my<00:03:06.810> resources

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
leave drop all my resources

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.370 
leave drop all my resources
you<00:03:08.130> drop<00:03:08.610> your<00:03:08.790> resources<00:03:09.390> back<00:03:09.720> into<00:03:09.780> the

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
you drop your resources back into the

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.650 
you drop your resources back into the
docks<00:03:10.739> tank<00:03:11.250> that<00:03:11.519> they<00:03:11.670> change<00:03:11.970> from<00:03:12.209> so<00:03:12.510> like

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
docks tank that they change from so like

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.890 
docks tank that they change from so like
the<00:03:12.810> coal<00:03:13.050> would<00:03:13.319> go<00:03:13.470> back<00:03:13.709> into<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.190> cave<00:03:14.459> and

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
the coal would go back into the cave and

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.410 
the coal would go back into the cave and
the<00:03:15.900> wood<00:03:16.080> card<00:03:16.380> would<00:03:16.620> go<00:03:16.829> into<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:17.970> outside

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
the wood card would go into the outside

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.780 
the wood card would go into the outside
duct<00:03:19.310> so<00:03:20.310> let's<00:03:20.760> see<00:03:21.890> okay<00:03:22.890> so<00:03:23.040> I<00:03:23.220> rolled<00:03:23.670> it

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
duct so let's see okay so I rolled it

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.940 
duct so let's see okay so I rolled it
three<00:03:23.850> and<00:03:24.329> that's<00:03:24.630> not<00:03:24.959> lower<00:03:25.290> than<00:03:25.590> three

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
three and that's not lower than three

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.759 
three and that's not lower than three
because<00:03:26.790> it<00:03:26.970> is<00:03:27.090> three<00:03:27.299> so<00:03:28.049> that<00:03:28.260> means<00:03:28.470> the

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
because it is three so that means the

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.560 
because it is three so that means the
spider<00:03:29.070> killed<00:03:29.459> me<00:03:29.610> and<00:03:29.790> I<00:03:30.269> would<00:03:30.390> basically

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
spider killed me and I would basically

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.890 
spider killed me and I would basically
lose<00:03:31.079> all<00:03:31.350> my<00:03:31.890> cards<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:33.060> cobblestones<00:03:33.720> the

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
lose all my cards the cobblestones the

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.330 
lose all my cards the cobblestones the
only<00:03:34.079> one<00:03:34.260> that<00:03:34.410> could<00:03:34.590> be<00:03:34.709> tricky

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
only one that could be tricky

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.580 
only one that could be tricky
this<00:03:35.940> one's<00:03:36.209> outside<00:03:36.480> so<00:03:37.049> would<00:03:37.140> go<00:03:37.200> into<00:03:37.410> the

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
this one's outside so would go into the

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.530 
this one's outside so would go into the
outside<00:03:37.950> deck<00:03:38.190> and<00:03:38.700> he<00:03:38.790> placed<00:03:39.060> it<00:03:39.269> at<00:03:39.390> the

outside deck and he placed it at the

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.560 
outside deck and he placed it at the
bottom<00:03:39.720> of<00:03:39.989> the<00:03:40.110> deck<00:03:41.060> one<00:03:42.060> way<00:03:42.239> you<00:03:42.299> could

could still keep the crafting card
because<00:06:31.430> it's<00:06:31.730> already<00:06:32.120> made<00:06:32.360> basically

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:34.550 
because it's already made basically

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.870 
because it's already made basically
and<00:06:34.670> and<00:06:34.910> basically<00:06:35.950> if<00:06:36.950> I<00:06:37.100> needed<00:06:37.400> the<00:06:37.670> wood

need to keep the resource that's tied to

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.440 
need to keep the resource that's tied to
it<00:06:57.170> this<00:06:57.440> is<00:06:57.500> for<00:06:57.920> upgrading<00:06:58.580> purposes<00:06:59.270> so<00:06:59.420> you

00:06:59.440 --> 00:06:59.450 
it this is for upgrading purposes so you

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:03.730 
it this is for upgrading purposes so you
could<00:06:59.690> keep<00:06:59.840> track<00:07:00.170> so<00:07:01.870> the<00:07:02.870> cobblestone<00:07:03.530> is

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:03.740 
could keep track so the cobblestone is

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.070 
could keep track so the cobblestone is
tied<00:07:04.010> to<00:07:04.250> the<00:07:04.370> sword<00:07:04.670> and<00:07:04.850> the<00:07:05.060> iron<00:07:05.270> is<00:07:05.600> tied

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:06.080 
tied to the sword and the iron is tied

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.370 
tied to the sword and the iron is tied
to<00:07:06.290> the<00:07:06.410> pickaxe<00:07:06.830> so<00:07:07.580> let's<00:07:07.730> say<00:07:07.970> it's<00:07:08.900> my<00:07:09.080> turn

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:09.380 
to the pickaxe so let's say it's my turn

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.030 
to the pickaxe so let's say it's my turn
again<00:07:09.530> and<00:07:09.980> I<00:07:10.340> upgrade<00:07:10.790> the<00:07:10.940> sword<00:07:11.980> now<00:07:12.980> the

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:13.040 
again and I upgrade the sword now the

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.370 
again and I upgrade the sword now the
iron<00:07:13.430> is<00:07:13.760> tied<00:07:14.030> to<00:07:14.240> the<00:07:14.360> pickaxe<00:07:14.810> and<00:07:15.050> the

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:15.380 
iron is tied to the pickaxe and the

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:18.070 
iron is tied to the pickaxe and the
sword<00:07:15.710> so<00:07:16.520> that<00:07:16.700> means<00:07:16.940> if<00:07:17.210> I<00:07:17.450> wanted<00:07:17.870> to<00:07:18.050> I

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 
sword so that means if I wanted to I

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.230 
sword so that means if I wanted to I
could<00:07:18.500> drop<00:07:18.680> the<00:07:18.920> cobblestone<00:07:19.520> at<00:07:19.730> this<00:07:19.940> point

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:20.240 
could drop the cobblestone at this point

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.230 
could drop the cobblestone at this point
because<00:07:20.690> it's<00:07:21.560> no<00:07:21.770> longer<00:07:22.040> needed<00:07:22.340> for<00:07:22.880> either

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:23.240 
because it's no longer needed for either

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:28.390 
because it's no longer needed for either
item<00:07:24.010> and<00:07:26.050> that's<00:07:27.050> about<00:07:27.200> it<00:07:27.380> so<00:07:27.560> though<00:07:28.070> some

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:28.400 
item and that's about it so though some

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.240 
item and that's about it so though some
of<00:07:28.550> this<00:07:28.730> tutorial
