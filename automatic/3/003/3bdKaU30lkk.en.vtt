00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.930 
guy playing vein cum hardy right I think
that<00:05:07.710> where<00:05:08.010> it's<00:05:08.190> going<00:05:08.340> to<00:05:08.400> be<00:05:08.550> harder<00:05:08.910> to

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
that where it's going to be harder to

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.100 
that where it's going to be harder to
nolan<00:05:09.660> eyes<00:05:09.890> vain<00:05:11.030> then<00:05:12.030> it<00:05:12.420> would<00:05:12.630> be<00:05:12.660> to

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
nolan eyes vain then it would be to

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.500 
nolan eyes vain then it would be to
nolan<00:05:13.530> eyes<00:05:13.650> Catwoman<00:05:14.340> I<00:05:14.490> still<00:05:15.120> think<00:05:15.150> it's

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
nolan eyes Catwoman I still think it's

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.680 
nolan eyes Catwoman I still think it's
going<00:05:15.690> to<00:05:15.750> be<00:05:15.810> easy<00:05:16.110> to<00:05:16.320> do<00:05:17.030> yeah<00:05:18.030> that's<00:05:18.420> thing

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
going to be easy to do yeah that's thing

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.180 
going to be easy to do yeah that's thing
like<00:05:18.870> i'll<00:05:19.050> give<00:05:19.290> that<00:05:19.590> it's<00:05:19.890> going<00:05:20.010> to<00:05:20.100> be

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
like i'll give that it's going to be

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.010 
like i'll give that it's going to be
difficult<00:05:20.370> because<00:05:20.790> most<00:05:21.300> of<00:05:21.510> the<00:05:21.630> villains

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
difficult because most of the villains

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.290 
difficult because most of the villains
that<00:05:22.260> they've<00:05:22.440> chosen<00:05:22.680> a<00:05:23.010> Nolan<00:05:23.310> eyes<00:05:23.460> haven't

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
that they've chosen a Nolan eyes haven't

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.750 
that they've chosen a Nolan eyes haven't
really<00:05:24.780> been<00:05:25.040> the<00:05:26.040> kind<00:05:26.280> of<00:05:26.400> villain<00:05:26.550> like

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
really been the kind of villain like

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.060 
really been the kind of villain like
babe<00:05:27.200> they've<00:05:28.200> been<00:05:28.440> the<00:05:28.590> guy<00:05:28.740> that's<00:05:28.980> like

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
babe they've been the guy that's like

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.220 
babe they've been the guy that's like
the<00:05:29.250> kind<00:05:29.520> of<00:05:29.670> realistic<00:05:29.970> already<00:05:30.420> and<00:05:30.720> so<00:05:31.200> a

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.230 
the kind of realistic already and so a

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.410 
the kind of realistic already and so a
guy<00:05:31.410> that<00:05:31.680> hops<00:05:31.920> up<00:05:32.130> on<00:05:32.280> Super<00:05:32.670> Soldier<00:05:32.850> Serum

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:33.420 
guy that hops up on Super Soldier Serum

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.630 
guy that hops up on Super Soldier Serum
isn't<00:05:34.050> really<00:05:34.560> the<00:05:34.860> kind<00:05:35.040> of<00:05:35.190> guy<00:05:35.310> that<00:05:35.340> been

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
isn't really the kind of guy that been

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.160 
isn't really the kind of guy that been
doing<00:05:35.910> but<00:05:36.180> I<00:05:36.210> think<00:05:36.510> they'll<00:05:36.750> do<00:05:36.900> a<00:05:36.930> good<00:05:37.110> job

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:37.170 
doing but I think they'll do a good job

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.740 
doing but I think they'll do a good job
because<00:05:37.590> they've<00:05:38.250> done<00:05:38.700> well<00:05:38.880> before<00:05:39.060> and<00:05:39.600> I

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
because they've done well before and I

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.930 
because they've done well before and I
mean<00:05:39.870> even<00:05:40.130> scarecrow<00:05:41.130> who<00:05:41.370> uses<00:05:41.550> like<00:05:41.820> the

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
mean even scarecrow who uses like the

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.610 
mean even scarecrow who uses like the
toxins<00:05:42.450> they<00:05:42.600> translated<00:05:43.020> that<00:05:43.200> pretty<00:05:43.440> good

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
toxins they translated that pretty good

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.890 
toxins they translated that pretty good
they<00:05:43.980> made<00:05:44.160> that<00:05:44.250> pretty<00:05:44.490> believable<00:05:44.790> I<00:05:45.270> think

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
they made that pretty believable I think

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.000 
they made that pretty believable I think
that<00:05:46.290> was<00:05:46.560> bein<00:05:46.860> they're<00:05:47.730> either<00:05:47.940> going<00:05:48.330> to

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
that was bein they're either going to

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:53.510 
that was bein they're either going to
cut<00:05:50.010> his<00:05:50.610> a<00:05:50.960> drugged-out<00:05:51.960> venom<00:05:52.710> they're

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
cut his a drugged-out venom they're

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.760 
cut his a drugged-out venom they're
either<00:05:53.610> going<00:05:53.790> to<00:05:53.880> cut<00:05:54.060> venom<00:05:54.420> out<00:05:54.770> completely

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
either going to cut venom out completely

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.200 
either going to cut venom out completely
or<00:05:56.360> it's<00:05:57.360> just<00:05:57.480> going<00:05:57.810> to<00:05:57.840> be<00:05:57.900> like<00:05:58.470> a<00:05:58.530> PCP<00:05:59.490> kind

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.210 
or it's just going to be like a PCP kind

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.240 
or it's just going to be like a PCP kind
of<00:06:00.300> drug<00:06:00.570> he's<00:06:00.990> gonna<00:06:01.200> maybe<00:06:01.680> get<00:06:01.950> a<00:06:02.010> bit

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
of drug he's gonna maybe get a bit

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.580 
of drug he's gonna maybe get a bit
bigger<00:06:02.550> his<00:06:03.390> strengths<00:06:03.870> going<00:06:04.080> to<00:06:04.140> increase

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.590 
bigger his strengths going to increase

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.050 
bigger his strengths going to increase
and<00:06:04.950> he's<00:06:05.040> probably<00:06:05.280> not<00:06:05.460> gonna<00:06:05.670> feel<00:06:05.880> any

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.060 
and he's probably not gonna feel any

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.020 
and he's probably not gonna feel any
pain<00:06:06.270> but<00:06:07.170> I<00:06:07.320> don't<00:06:07.560> see<00:06:07.800> him<00:06:07.980> changing<00:06:08.610> size

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030
