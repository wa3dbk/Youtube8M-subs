00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.830
 perfectly as Robert planned everything 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.159
 it went well and there was no error 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.320
 the fight was a bit dirty due to the 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.500
 kareem style but it was a great fight 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.289

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.619
 pons and there's nothing to take away is a 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:39.619
 great boxer 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.649
 starks 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.420
 a little dirty so much that it 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.849
 he stuck his head in and then a few 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.760
 knock down all that on what planet 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:18.180
 it affected you how it was that it was followed in 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.790
 the pile without without losing the head was 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.069
 thank God I have a good corner 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.959
 I thank God and my corner 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.670
 it helped keep me focused on not 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:30.209
 lose your head in some moments 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.280
 I wanted to exchange with him and look 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.430
 mean and told me to return to my 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.430
 rhythm 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.380
 have with him 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.510
 but not even as his power was in his 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.460
 blows were ever hurt any 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.170
 once you felt a strong blow but 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.600
 it will not hurt in any moment 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.000
 it was not prepared we will see well 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.120
 prepared physically and mentally for 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.970
 assimilate everything he could throw away and 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.080
 did not hit me a solid blow to that 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.080
