I'm<00:00:00.780> just<00:00:00.900> going<00:00:01.110> to<00:00:01.140> show<00:00:01.319> you<00:00:01.380> a<00:00:02.000> similar

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:04.040 
I'm just going to show you a similar

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.140 
I'm just going to show you a similar
setup<00:00:05.040> same<00:00:05.759> size<00:00:06.919> but<00:00:07.919> I<00:00:08.069> have<00:00:08.370> water<00:00:08.730> in<00:00:08.910> that

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
setup same size but I have water in that

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.519 
setup same size but I have water in that
airspace<00:00:10.190> this<00:00:11.190> meant<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.550> act<00:00:11.730> as<00:00:12.000> a<00:00:12.030> cooling

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:15.529 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:20.750

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
device for the reactor it doesn't seem

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.340 
device for the reactor it doesn't seem
to<00:00:20.820> call<00:00:21.180> that<00:00:21.390> much<00:00:23.689> as<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:24.779> can<00:00:24.900> see<00:00:25.080> here's

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
to call that much as you can see here's

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.689 
to call that much as you can see here's
115<00:00:26.189> degrees<00:00:26.539> output<00:00:27.539> in<00:00:27.710> 215<00:00:28.710> wrestling<00:00:29.429> flux

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
115 degrees output in 215 wrestling flux

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.889 
115 degrees output in 215 wrestling flux
per<00:00:29.880> tick<00:00:30.119> if<00:00:31.050> we<00:00:31.199> go<00:00:31.320> back<00:00:31.439> over<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.830> this<00:00:31.949> one

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899 
per tick if we go back over to this one

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.380 
per tick if we go back over to this one
see<00:00:33.899> 116<00:00:34.649> degrees<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.160> 217<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.120> there's<00:00:36.239> not

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
see 116 degrees and 217 so there's not

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.680 
see 116 degrees and 217 so there's not
that<00:00:36.420> much<00:00:36.809> different<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:38.239> think<00:00:39.239> this<00:00:39.390> may

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
that much different I think this may

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.750 
that much different I think this may
come<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.170> handy<00:00:40.200> with<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.890> bigger<00:00:41.250> reactors

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
come in handy with the bigger reactors

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.990 
come in handy with the bigger reactors
although<00:00:42.570> this<00:00:42.840> has<00:00:42.899> been<00:00:43.170> on<00:00:43.610> the<00:00:44.610> whole<00:00:44.760> time

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
although this has been on the whole time

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.180 
although this has been on the whole time
it's<00:00:45.270> got<00:00:45.390> 12<00:00:45.660> fuel<00:00:45.899> rods<00:00:46.280> and<00:00:48.500> it<00:00:49.500> hasn't<00:00:49.770> gone

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
it's got 12 fuel rods and it hasn't gone

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.189 
it's got 12 fuel rods and it hasn't gone
above<00:00:50.750> 1,600<00:00:51.750> degrees<00:00:53.480> it's<00:00:54.480> fairly<00:00:54.899> stable

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
above 1,600 degrees it's fairly stable

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:03.890 
above 1,600 degrees it's fairly stable
there<00:00:55.940> 3,100<00:00:56.940> redstone<00:00:57.510> flux<00:00:57.840> per<00:00:58.230> tick

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.020 

so<00:01:04.500> with<00:01:04.620> that<00:01:04.710> being<00:01:04.860> said<00:01:05.010> let's<00:01:05.430> move<00:01:05.640> on<00:01:05.820> to

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
so with that being said let's move on to

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.750 
so with that being said let's move on to
the<00:01:07.700> automation<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:10.370> logic<00:01:11.370> that<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.610> can

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
the automation and logic that you can

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.080 
the automation and logic that you can
get<00:01:11.880> with<00:01:11.940> these<00:01:12.180> reactors<00:01:13.130> so<00:01:14.130> if<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.370> place

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
get with these reactors so if you place

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.060 
get with these reactors so if you place
a<00:01:15.590> red<00:01:16.590> net<00:01:16.770> port<00:01:17.040> into<00:01:17.820> your<00:01:17.940> reactor<00:01:18.270> design

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
a red net port into your reactor design

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.760 
a red net port into your reactor design
you<00:01:20.070> can<00:01:20.100> interact<00:01:20.550> with<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.060> reactor<00:01:21.510> with

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
you can interact with the reactor with

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.050 
you can interact with the reactor with
MFR<00:01:23.450> redneck<00:01:24.450> controllers<00:01:25.670> as<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.790> can<00:01:26.910> see

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
MFR redneck controllers as you can see

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.260 
MFR redneck controllers as you can see
here<00:01:27.300> the<00:01:27.600> possibilities<00:01:28.560> are<00:01:29.120> quite<00:01:30.120> endless

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
here the possibilities are quite endless

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:39.530 
here the possibilities are quite endless
to<00:01:33.270> give<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.450> color<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:36.680> job<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.160> speak<00:01:38.540> just

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
to give a color a job so to speak just

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.390 
to give a color a job so to speak just
choose<00:01:40.110> one<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.650> these<00:01:40.890> logics<00:01:41.490> here<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:43.400> just

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
choose one of these logics here and just

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.190 
choose one of these logics here and just
drag<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.670> drop<00:01:44.940> the<00:01:45.000> icon<00:01:45.420> into<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.720> color

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
drag and drop the icon into the color

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:53.030 
drag and drop the icon into the color

leave<00:03:48.920> that<00:03:48.950> money<00:03:49.160> for<00:03:49.370> now<00:03:51.820> so<00:03:52.820> now<00:03:52.970> I'm

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
leave that money for now so now I'm

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.000 
leave that money for now so now I'm
going<00:03:53.090> to<00:03:53.210> move<00:03:53.330> on<00:03:53.420> to<00:03:53.570> the<00:03:53.690> reprocessing<00:03:54.470> of

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
can see here this input slot is marked

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.890 
can see here this input slot is marked
red<00:04:31.640> and<00:04:32.050> you<00:04:33.050> can<00:04:33.230> control<00:04:33.860> the<00:04:34.250> input<00:04:34.900> just

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
red and you can control the input just

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.530 
red and you can control the input just
like<00:04:36.050> thermal<00:04:36.290> expansion<00:04:36.920> and<00:04:37.100> the<00:04:37.510> output<00:04:38.510> is

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
like thermal expansion and the output is

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.500 
like thermal expansion and the output is
green<00:04:39.130> the<00:04:40.130> input<00:04:40.520> for<00:04:40.700> water<00:04:40.910> is<00:04:41.470> blue<00:04:42.470> and

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
green the input for water is blue and

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.200 
green the input for water is blue and
and<00:04:44.510> that's<00:04:44.900> it<00:04:45.580> as<00:04:46.580> you<00:04:46.700> can<00:04:46.760> see<00:04:46.910> they<00:04:47.060> were

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
and that's it as you can see they were

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:54.910 
and that's it as you can see they were
checked<00:04:47.600> with<00:04:48.110> this<00:04:48.230> chest<00:04:51.670> and<00:04:53.620> these<00:04:54.620> can<00:04:54.800> be

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:54.920 
checked with this chest and these can be

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.910 
checked with this chest and these can be
used<00:04:55.130> as<00:04:55.280> fuel<00:04:55.430> also<00:04:56.050> if<00:04:57.050> I<00:04:57.500> have<00:04:57.650> an<00:04:57.770> empty

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:57.920 
used as fuel also if I have an empty

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.490 
used as fuel also if I have an empty
reactor<00:04:58.400> somewhere

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:10.620 

probably<00:05:03.500> not

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:17.310 

so<00:05:11.290> here<00:05:11.710> let<00:05:11.860> me<00:05:11.950> just<00:05:12.130> demonstrate<00:05:16.230> that<00:05:17.230> you

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
so here let me just demonstrate that you

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:41.300 
so here let me just demonstrate that you
don't<00:05:17.590> need<00:05:17.770> to<00:05:17.920> leave<00:05:18.070> a<00:05:18.100> space<00:05:39.360> the

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
don't need to leave a space the

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:46.800 
don't need to leave a space the
controller<00:05:45.210> let's<00:05:46.210> do<00:05:46.360> but<00:05:46.540> we<00:05:46.630> block

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
controller let's do but we block

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:53.210 
controller let's do but we block
complete<00:05:47.490> and<00:05:48.490> we'll<00:05:48.670> give<00:05:48.820> it<00:05:48.850> a<00:05:50.340> is<00:05:51.340> it<00:05:51.490> gone

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
complete and we'll give it a is it gone

00:05:53.220 --> 00:06:00.270 
complete and we'll give it a is it gone
access<00:05:54.220> port<00:05:54.840> to<00:05:55.840> input<00:05:56.230> off<00:05:56.350> you'll<00:05:59.130> put<00:06:00.130> in

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 
access port to input off you'll put in

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.680 
access port to input off you'll put in
the<00:06:00.400> plutonium<00:06:01.470> let's<00:06:02.470> put<00:06:02.650> some<00:06:03.690> reactor

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.690 
the plutonium let's put some reactor

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.290 
the plutonium let's put some reactor
glass<00:06:04.960> just<00:06:05.260> to<00:06:05.350> see<00:06:05.620> oh<00:06:05.910> it's<00:06:06.910> still<00:06:07.090> you<00:06:07.240> know

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.300 
glass just to see oh it's still you know

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:13.380 
glass just to see oh it's still you know
I<00:06:07.510> thought<00:06:07.720> it<00:06:07.840> like<00:06:08.140> I<00:06:08.290> blue<00:06:12.030> yeah<00:06:13.030> there<00:06:13.300> we

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:13.390 
I thought it like I blue yeah there we

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:19.680 
I thought it like I blue yeah there we
go<00:06:15.600> now<00:06:16.600> I've<00:06:16.690> got<00:06:16.870> some<00:06:17.140> of<00:06:17.260> these<00:06:18.690> reactors

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:19.690 
go now I've got some of these reactors

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.800 
go now I've got some of these reactors
with<00:06:19.900> no<00:06:20.050> air<00:06:20.260> space<00:06:20.500> here<00:06:21.240> you<00:06:22.240> can<00:06:22.420> see<00:06:22.570> the

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:22.810 
with no air space here you can see the

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.910 
with no air space here you can see the
temperatures<00:06:23.140> do<00:06:23.820> are<00:06:24.820> quite<00:06:25.150> stable<00:06:25.920> it's

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:26.920 
temperatures do are quite stable it's

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.660 
temperatures do are quite stable it's
quite<00:06:27.160> a<00:06:27.190> nice<00:06:27.340> design<00:06:27.670> this<00:06:27.850> one<00:06:28.770> that's<00:06:29.770> four

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:30.670 
quite a nice design this one that's four

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:34.680 
quite a nice design this one that's four
words<00:06:30.700> in<00:06:31.120> a<00:06:31.180> row<00:06:33.060> there's<00:06:34.060> that<00:06:34.210> cross<00:06:34.450> one<00:06:34.660> I

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:34.690 
words in a row there's that cross one I

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:40.520 
words in a row there's that cross one I
showed<00:06:34.930> you<00:06:35.140> earlier<00:06:38.580> so<00:06:39.580> yeah<00:06:39.730> this<00:06:39.880> mod<00:06:40.120> is

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:40.530 
showed you earlier so yeah this mod is

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.810 
showed you earlier so yeah this mod is
really<00:06:41.530> allows<00:06:41.740> you<00:06:41.920> to<00:06:42.040> get<00:06:42.130> creative<00:06:42.610> with

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:42.820 
really allows you to get creative with

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.920 
really allows you to get creative with
the<00:06:43.000> design<00:06:43.890> and<00:06:45.150> it's<00:06:46.150> quite<00:06:46.330> a<00:06:46.360> big<00:06:46.540> reactor

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:46.930 
the design and it's quite a big reactor

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:53.770 
the design and it's quite a big reactor
here<00:06:49.080> producing<00:06:50.080> quite<00:06:50.320> a<00:06:50.350> lot<00:06:50.650> of<00:06:50.680> power

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:53.780 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.900 

another<00:06:54.780> big<00:06:54.990> reactor<00:06:55.380> but<00:06:55.590> with<00:06:55.740> water<00:06:56.100> to

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:56.910 
another big reactor but with water to

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.719 
another big reactor but with water to
call<00:06:57.150> it<00:06:57.500> which<00:06:58.500> doesn't<00:06:59.310> really<00:06:59.400> make<00:06:59.580> that

00:06:59.719 --> 00:06:59.729 
call it which doesn't really make that

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:01.820 
call it which doesn't really make that
much<00:06:59.790> of<00:06:59.880> a<00:07:00.060> difference<00:07:00.090> in<00:07:00.690> my<00:07:01.020> opinion<00:07:01.320> well

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:01.830 
much of a difference in my opinion well

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.990 
much of a difference in my opinion well
through<00:07:02.040> testing<00:07:02.460> an<00:07:02.880> opinion<00:07:04.340> so<00:07:05.340> we<00:07:05.490> have<00:07:05.610> 13

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000 
through testing an opinion so we have 13

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.469 
through testing an opinion so we have 13
rods<00:07:06.270> here<00:07:08.660> 2,400<00:07:09.660> redstone<00:07:10.020> and<00:07:10.310> almost

00:07:11.469 --> 00:07:11.479 
rods here 2,400 redstone and almost

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:15.890 
rods here 2,400 redstone and almost
1,400<00:07:12.479> degrees<00:07:13.880> 12<00:07:14.880> watts<00:07:15.090> here<00:07:15.330> hotter

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:15.900 
1,400 degrees 12 watts here hotter

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:21.409 
1,400 degrees 12 watts here hotter
reactor<00:07:16.770> and<00:07:17.270> just<00:07:18.270> a<00:07:18.360> touch<00:07:18.540> more<00:07:18.810> power<00:07:20.419> but

00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:21.419 
reactor and just a touch more power but

00:07:21.419 --> 00:07:27.350 
reactor and just a touch more power but
these<00:07:21.630> rods<00:07:21.900> are<00:07:22.139> taller<00:07:22.440> than<00:07:22.620> these<00:07:26.360> so

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.360 
these rods are taller than these so
