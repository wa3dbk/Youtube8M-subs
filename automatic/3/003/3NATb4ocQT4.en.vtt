00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
on a look that I've been wearing a lot

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:15.860 
on a look that I've been wearing a lot
recently<00:00:14.880> I<00:00:15.150> think<00:00:15.269> I've<00:00:15.450> worn<00:00:15.570> it<00:00:15.719> in<00:00:15.750> the

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
recently I think I've worn it in the

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.269 
recently I think I've worn it in the
past<00:00:16.049> several<00:00:16.379> videos<00:00:16.830> that<00:00:16.859> I've<00:00:17.160> uploaded

past several videos that I've uploaded

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.820 
past several videos that I've uploaded
and<00:00:18.060> it's<00:00:18.180> just<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.449> very<00:00:18.630> natural<00:00:19.080> look<00:00:19.650> but

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
and it's just a very natural look but

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.230 
and it's just a very natural look but
it's<00:00:20.010> kind<00:00:20.279> of<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.430> little<00:00:20.580> bit<00:00:20.699> different<00:00:20.760> than

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
it's kind of a little bit different than

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.599 
it's kind of a little bit different than
what<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:21.420> usually<00:00:21.810> do<00:00:22.140> my<00:00:22.289> eyeshadow<00:00:22.470> like<00:00:23.100> I<00:00:23.340> do

what I usually do my eyeshadow like I do

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.340 
what I usually do my eyeshadow like I do
the<00:00:23.820> crease<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.269> little<00:00:24.300> bit<00:00:24.600> differently<00:00:25.019> so<00:00:25.289> I

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
the crease a little bit differently so I

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.420 
the crease a little bit differently so I
wanted<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.590> go<00:00:25.740> ahead<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.039> show<00:00:26.160> you<00:00:26.220> guys

wanted to go ahead and show you guys
what<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:26.760> is<00:00:26.880> maybe<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:27.420> will<00:00:27.480> inspire<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:28.199> to

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
what it is maybe it will inspire you to

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.460 
eyeliner I find that it works a lot
better<00:03:40.130> with<00:03:40.460> gel<00:03:40.700> liner<00:03:40.970> than<00:03:41.270> their<00:03:41.450> East<00:03:41.690> 65

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
better with gel liner than their East 65

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.380 
better with gel liner than their East 65
I<00:03:42.500> think<00:03:42.890> is<00:03:42.980> what<00:03:43.130> I<00:03:43.160> used<00:03:43.400> before<00:03:43.820> it's<00:03:44.300> a

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
I think is what I used before it's a

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.940 
I think is what I used before it's a
little<00:03:44.630> more<00:03:44.780> precise<00:03:45.290> I<00:03:45.500> don't<00:03:45.680> know<00:03:45.770> why<00:03:45.920> I

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
little more precise I don't know why I

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.410 
little more precise I don't know why I
think<00:03:46.220> it's<00:03:46.310> just<00:03:46.460> a<00:03:46.520> little<00:03:46.670> bit<00:03:46.880> thinner<00:03:47.180> or

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
think it's just a little bit thinner or

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.060 
think it's just a little bit thinner or
something<00:03:47.810> so<00:03:48.170> I'm<00:03:48.230> just<00:03:48.350> going<00:03:48.530> to<00:03:48.590> align<00:03:48.860> my
