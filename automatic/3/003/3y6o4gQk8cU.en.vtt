00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello we are sure shop.it and August ago 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.359
 very very hot but we also have a 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.890
 galaxy tab 3 8 inches to approve will be 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.570
 available in Italy only at 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.650
 September but I bought some in 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.480
 United States 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.730
 I tried it for about ten days 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.680
 now I'm ready to tell you how this is 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.869
 the most stylish tablet is thinner 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.990
 of the new galaxy tab three to one line 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.619
 8-inch screen weighs 314 grams and 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.199
 7.4 mm thick from construction quality 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:32.270
 which I think is among the best views 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.559
 in the tablet sector throughout 2013 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.500
 this brown version very much 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.300
 elegant with coppery finishes with one 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.120
 texture that is under the glossy paint 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.309
 which gives an additional sense of elegance to the 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.680
 everything but on the net is also available 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.899
 the white and silver version much more 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.520
 classic from this whole point of view 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.440
 the fraction of the tablet is clearly for 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.110
 the 8 inch display with resolution of 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.579
 1080 400 pixels therefore a density that 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.800
 allows you to read the texts well too 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.170
 smaller to debuts arriving 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.969
 really stick here of the frame and one 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.240
 brightness and that the viewing angles 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.909
 absolutely adequate and ergonomic 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.830
 allows an ergonomics that is in my opinion 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.930
 really the best view in 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.170
 this format in this area because 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.000
 with the edges so rounded that they end 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.670
 to fit together perfectly 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.590
 fingertips is that the palm as you see 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.950
 horizontal mode but also in this way 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:29.250
 vertical mode for readings maybe 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.049
 or for viewing photos with with 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.729
 hands with hands sliding yes 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.170
 really comes out to have a great one 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.689
 excellent ergonomics and excellent 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.640
 pisa pleasantness of 8 inches 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.320
 really does this format justice 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.150
 not just because the screen is almost a 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.280
 full screen because you believe i 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.530
 buttons are on the frame are 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.210
 capacitive except the central one are 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.890
 inside android therefore was missing 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.509
 with the beard of the operating system but 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.030
 also because we have a whole series of 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.860
 features that the company inserts 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.979
 just and only in these models 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.500
 this is the multi view that they too a 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.479
 performance level suffers a little 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.610
 performance that then we will see a little bit 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.920
 later the processor proves 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.750
 however a very useful thing for the 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.970
 use of content and its own 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.150
 context with the 8 inch tablet have one 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.010
 extra gear 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.569
 present ok arrived at this point 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.610
 you will surely understand that I like it 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.290
 very much this galaxy tab 3 8 inches 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.120
 i like the format i like how it is 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.180
 holds in his hand the feeling that gives 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.799
 constructive solidity that encloses however 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.239
 how it behaves in the use of all 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.230
 days how goes android what is 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.810
 user experience 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.000
 we see samsung has entered all the 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.129
 functionality of its touch interface 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.379
 which takes the android system with 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.209
 environment particularly different from 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:42.340
 the standard one to the google one between 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.349
 all options entered some useful 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.790
 some a little less I point you to the 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.909
 fencer what allows you to 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.709
 send the audio video signal to a TV 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:52.209
 wireless using the wifi though 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.810
 compatible only with devices 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.670
 samsung has as I noticed and the power 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.489
 saving mode the mode that allows you 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.049
 to save energy to disable 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.730
 some function therefore very useful a 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.250
 level of autonomy 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.250
 the exynos processor 42 to the core to 1.5 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.260
 gigahertz with a lap and a half of ram yes 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.389
 they behave discreetly but it is a bit 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.209
 a pity to see a device 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:19.030
 so well conceived then conceptually 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.709
 entrusted to such hardware 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.329
 however, the results are satisfactory 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.000
 for the category and tablet 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:26.919
 except for some slight hitches 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.690
 slight slowdown behaves well 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:31.060
 allows excellent web browsing 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:34.299
 very fluid at this point of view 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.579
 plays full hd movies in the main ones 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:39.370
 formed without obviously asking too much 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:41.799
 as well as the graphic mali 400mp 2 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.810
 allows you to play titles 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:46.150
 relatively recent and in any case those 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.209
 here we aim to play on this 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.620
 kind of devices one of the things 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.470
 better than this hardware the reception 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.239
 gps really really notable also like 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.470
 see in indoor environments in contexts 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.139
 where the other tablets fail 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.690
 not even to hook one of the satellite 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:03.909
 here we have even at the 19 in 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.909
 this moment while the two cameras 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:09.849
 the 1.2 megapixel front and the 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:13.000
 5 megapixel rear are so-so 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:14.829
 they are medium-low end are good 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.630
 for video calls for some pictures but 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:19.419
 in short we have seen in the tablets also 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.949
 cheap in the best models 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.870
 also the audio system with i 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:25.210
 two speakers positioned here on 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:32.470
 side that really succeed 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:34.930
 providing a great volume is also true 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:38.860
 that being both on one side ends 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:44.620
 to cover them up maybe too much 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:46.990
 the sensor is also easy to use 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.430
 integrated that allows you to use the 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.650
 tablet is just like a 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.060
 remote control from the act are pre-installed 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.729
 some useful applications that allow 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.740
 to also manage the video schedule 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:59.380
 then schedule other registrations 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.599
 to say also to manage the sky decoder is 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.910
 support or tg 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:05.740
 of the micro usb up here that I do not 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.289
 only allows you to charge the tablet 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:11.800
 also from the pc but to connect hard disk 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:13.210
 pen and mouse and external keyboards e 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.970
 before summing up two words 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.190
 on the battery life a 4.550 battery 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.289
 Milan for now and I managed to overcome 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.300
 5 hours of very very intense use 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:24.460
 with maximum brightness three fi 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.949
 notifications and no mode of 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.110
 active energy saving but I believe that 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:31.120
 you can get to seven maybe 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.570
 eight will have a little with these parameters 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.830
 despite this, however, you see the 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.270
 saving on standby and is good e 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.039
 obtained for a whole weekend with 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.509
 notifications to read mails for 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:40.870
 check the browser about this stuff 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:43.719
 gender 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:46.389
 no problem whatsoever we are a 

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:48.430
 under the best tablets in the industry 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:50.169
 as I think of the nexus 7 but anyway 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.300
 autonomy is not a problem at all 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:54.699
 because under 38 comedians 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:57.039
 ok it's all galaxy tab 3 8 inches will be 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:59.650
 for sale in Italy from September with a 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:01.960
 price list of 299 euros then obviously in the 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.849
 price stores will drop a little is not 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.590
 we have seen a perfect device 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:07.630
 could be more powerful and could also 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.099
 costing less this is true however it is 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.289
 surely a tablet has come out 

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:13.509
 fun to use very nice 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:14.919
 also to be seen that you have to take 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:16.599
 in consideration even if you are 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:18.729
 looking for a 7 inch tablet because 

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:21.190
 which dimensions are still contained 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:22.599
 portability is by no means compromised 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.820
 but you have the advantage of having 

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:26.800
 really that extra space that comes back 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.270
 very very convenient when reading yes 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.620
 reads on the web you read ebooks o 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.960
 however you look at content 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.490
 multimedia find other information 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.320
 other patch details but that all 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:38.190
 other things in the review 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.190
 and from on evolution
