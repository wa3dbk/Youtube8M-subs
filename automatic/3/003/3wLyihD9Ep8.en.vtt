00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
more than one thing or does quite a lot

of things PRTG is a kind of network
monitoring<00:00:53.280> tool<00:00:53.870> and<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:55.500> comes<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.890> few

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
monitoring tool and it comes in a few

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.540 
monitoring tool and it comes in a few
different<00:00:56.160> versions<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:57.360> think<00:00:57.840> camps<00:00:58.550> that

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
different versions I think camps that

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.599 
different versions I think camps that
both<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.390> there's<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.870> free<00:01:01.140> one<00:01:01.320> which<00:01:02.160> lets

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
both the there's a free one which lets

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.920 
both the there's a free one which lets
you<00:01:02.850> have<00:01:03.090> ten<00:01:04.019> three<00:01:04.409> sensors<00:01:04.890> I'll<00:01:05.070> explain

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
you have ten three sensors I'll explain

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.300 
you have ten three sensors I'll explain
in<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:07.260> couple<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.590> minutes<00:01:07.680> while<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.070> means

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
in a couple of minutes while that means

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.210 
in a couple of minutes while that means
but<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.330> can<00:01:09.510> upgrade<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.990> 20<00:01:10.260> sensors<00:01:10.950> if<00:01:11.100> you

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
but you can upgrade to 20 sensors if you

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.850 
but you can upgrade to 20 sensors if you
link<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.970> website<00:01:12.180> from<00:01:12.750> your<00:01:13.350> website

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
link to the website from your website

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.969 
link to the website from your website
and<00:01:14.070> then<00:01:14.220> tell<00:01:14.880> them<00:01:15.000> about<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.680> so<00:01:16.680> what<00:01:16.890> it

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
and then tell them about it so what it

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.039 
and then tell them about it so what it
does<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.220> first<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.270> all<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.600> would<00:01:18.689> install

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
does is first of all you would install

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.640 
does is first of all you would install
it<00:01:19.259> on<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.530> server<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.630> it<00:01:21.630> kind<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.700> create<00:01:23.700> a

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
it on a server and it kind of create a

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.130 
it on a server and it kind of create a
website<00:01:25.650> running<00:01:26.189> locally<00:01:26.700> on<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.840> server

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
website running locally on the server

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.310 
website running locally on the server

stats<00:01:46.860> about<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.640> server<00:01:47.909> so<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:48.899> set<00:01:49.200> up

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
stats about the server so you set up

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.020 
stats about the server so you set up
sensors<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.070> they're<00:01:50.490> basically<00:01:50.909> the

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
sensors and they're basically the

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.350 
sensors and they're basically the
sensors<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.840> monitor<00:01:51.990> things<00:01:52.560> like<00:01:53.360> maybe

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
sensors to monitor things like maybe

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.020 
sensors to monitor things like maybe

that<00:02:04.860> you'd<00:02:05.100> have<00:02:05.250> running<00:02:06.290> you<00:02:07.290> can<00:02:07.500> set<00:02:07.829> it

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
that you'd have running you can set it

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.369 
that you'd have running you can set it
up<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.160> monitor<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.940> status<00:02:09.239> of<00:02:09.629> an<00:02:09.810> ftp

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
up to monitor the status of an ftp

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.390 
up to monitor the status of an ftp
server

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
server

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.179 
server
it's<00:02:11.939> the<00:02:12.540> list<00:02:12.959> just<00:02:13.110> goes<00:02:13.200> on<00:02:13.379> and<00:02:13.680> on<00:02:13.860> of<00:02:14.069> the

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:14.189 
it's the list just goes on and on of the

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:16.190 
it's the list just goes on and on of the
different<00:02:14.519> things<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:15.030> can<00:02:15.450> have<00:02:15.629> it<00:02:15.750> monitor

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
different things you can have it monitor

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.720 
different things you can have it monitor
so<00:02:16.439> they<00:02:16.530> call<00:02:16.739> sensors<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.430> Free<00:02:17.640> Edition

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
so they call sensors the Free Edition

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
things you want to monitor then you can

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.050 
things you want to monitor then you can
set<00:02:34.230> up<00:02:36.200> what<00:02:37.200> what<00:02:37.409> does<00:02:37.590> calls<00:02:38.099> maps<00:02:38.700> which

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
set up what what does calls maps which

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.140 
set up what what does calls maps which
is<00:02:39.299> basically<00:02:39.750> just<00:02:39.870> a<00:02:40.230> web<00:02:40.590> page<00:02:40.859> and<00:02:41.700> that

is basically just a web page and that

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.729 
is basically just a web page and that
you<00:02:42.299> can<00:02:42.329> put<00:02:42.720> a<00:02:42.750> lot<00:02:42.959> of<00:02:42.989> different<00:02:43.140> graphs

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
you can put a lot of different graphs

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.530 
you can put a lot of different graphs
and<00:02:44.010> tables<00:02:44.069> and<00:02:44.700> things<00:02:44.730> on<00:02:45.030> and<00:02:45.180> it's<00:02:45.299> really

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
and tables and things on and it's really

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.020

you<00:02:57.209> down<00:02:57.480> so<00:02:57.810> like<00:02:58.019> say<00:02:58.889> if<00:02:59.159> the<00:02:59.459> dns<00:03:00.239> server

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040

kind<00:03:02.040> of<00:03:02.129> feature<00:03:02.340> on<00:03:02.730> my<00:03:03.180> server<00:03:03.510> broke<00:03:04.319> for

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
kind of feature on my server broke for

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.550 
kind of feature on my server broke for
some<00:03:04.799> reason<00:03:05.189> or<00:03:05.359> the<00:03:06.359> hard<00:03:06.569> drive<00:03:06.689> became<00:03:07.230> too

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
some reason or the hard drive became too

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.119 
some reason or the hard drive became too
full<00:03:07.829> then<00:03:08.579> that<00:03:09.510> would<00:03:09.659> be<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.680> sensor<00:03:11.040> would

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
full then that would be the sensor would

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:13.729 
full then that would be the sensor would
be<00:03:11.250> clusters<00:03:11.730> down<00:03:12.239> and<00:03:12.540> would<00:03:13.109> kind<00:03:13.470> of<00:03:13.530> go

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
be clusters down and would kind of go

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.319 
be clusters down and would kind of go
red<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.310> it<00:03:14.549> would<00:03:14.670> show<00:03:14.700> up<00:03:15.000> on<00:03:15.120> that

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
red and it would show up on that

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.409 
red and it would show up on that
particular<00:03:15.720> list<00:03:16.169> then<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:17.340> third<00:03:17.549> map<00:03:18.150> that

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:18.419 
particular list then the third map that

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:21.050 
particular list then the third map that
i<00:03:18.449> created<00:03:18.870> is<00:03:19.199> kind<00:03:20.069> of<00:03:20.129> like<00:03:20.220> an<00:03:20.370> overview<00:03:20.970> of

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
i created is kind of like an overview of

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.780 
i created is kind of like an overview of
the<00:03:21.269> whole<00:03:21.810> server<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.620> whole<00:03:22.650> system<00:03:23.040> which

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
the whole server the whole system which

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.129 
the whole server the whole system which
shows<00:03:24.919> fund<00:03:25.919> with<00:03:26.220> cpu<00:03:26.819> usage<00:03:27.180> with<00:03:27.629> real<00:03:27.870> time

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
shows fund with cpu usage with real time

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:30.050 
shows fund with cpu usage with real time
graphs<00:03:28.500> it's<00:03:28.769> it's<00:03:29.190> really<00:03:29.459> cool<00:03:29.639> and<00:03:29.879> then

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
graphs it's it's really cool and then

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.649 
graphs it's it's really cool and then
I've<00:03:30.329> got<00:03:30.389> those<00:03:31.230> just<00:03:31.849> say<00:03:32.849> with<00:03:33.389> a<00:03:33.419> bit<00:03:33.629> of

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:33.659 
I've got those just say with a bit of

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:36.500 
I've got those just say with a bit of
JavaScript<00:03:34.349> every<00:03:35.129> 30<00:03:35.370> seconds<00:03:35.909> refreshes

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
JavaScript every 30 seconds refreshes

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.899 
JavaScript every 30 seconds refreshes
and<00:03:36.540> changes<00:03:37.079> to<00:03:37.199> the<00:03:37.260> next<00:03:37.530> one<00:03:37.699> open<00:03:38.699> on<00:03:38.790> my

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:38.909 
and changes to the next one open on my

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:41.059 
and changes to the next one open on my
monitor<00:03:39.150> all<00:03:39.510> day<00:03:39.720> with<00:03:40.019> in<00:03:40.260> just<00:03:40.680> in<00:03:40.799> a<00:03:40.859> web

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
monitor all day with in just in a web

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.149 
monitor all day with in just in a web
browser<00:03:41.299> and<00:03:42.299> then<00:03:42.930> I<00:03:42.959> can<00:03:43.199> see<00:03:43.440> all<00:03:43.769> that

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 
browser and then I can see all that

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:47.149 
browser and then I can see all that
information<00:03:44.840> in<00:03:45.840> real<00:03:46.229> time<00:03:46.260> about<00:03:47.010> the

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:47.159 
information in real time about the

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:50.119 
information in real time about the
server<00:03:47.400> so<00:03:47.729> if<00:03:48.209> something<00:03:48.780> goes<00:03:49.109> wrong<00:03:49.199> I<00:03:49.560> can

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
server so if something goes wrong I can

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:51.559 
server so if something goes wrong I can
see<00:03:50.310> it<00:03:50.400> stretch<00:03:50.669> away<00:03:50.819> and<00:03:51.180> I<00:03:51.239> can<00:03:51.419> do

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
see it stretch away and I can do

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.610 
see it stretch away and I can do
something<00:03:51.599> about<00:03:52.019> it<00:03:53.479> PRTG<00:03:54.479> grid<00:03:55.139> network

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620
