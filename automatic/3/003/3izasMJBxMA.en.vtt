 Yes The point of PC purchase in this video 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:16.430
 We will little commentary about the point of the tablet purchase 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:22.700
 First of all , the most important thing in purchasing a PC or tablet 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:25.860
 What is the purpose of buying a computer or tablet ? 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:32.130
 It's very expensive. 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:35.060
 If it is a tablet, there may be 30,000 yen, but when it comes to it , it is really 100,000 yen 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:40.850
 There is also one that costs 200,000 yen 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:44.490
 So the most important thing is what do you buy a PC to do 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.730
 It is important to clarify this first 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.210
 For example 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:55.070
 Want to collect various information on the Internet 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:59.150
 Documents required for work using word processing software and spreadsheet software 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:03.650
 I want to make a table, I want to print a New Year 's card . 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:07.970
 I want to print a postcard It does not MAY or there is such a purpose 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.690
 I want to edit the video video I want to make the music I want to edit video 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.490
 I want to edit a photo 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:18.640
 I think the things I want to do are various 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:21.590
 That's clear , thinking about what to buy next 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:26.510
 Will be going 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:29.690
 As in first one of the point of purchase there are things Tteyuu tablet 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:36.590
 There is a thing called a tablet that is up 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:41.570
 So please think that this is mainly used to collect information 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:46.340
 Yeah I hear it is after Toka see the information on the internet 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:48.670
 services that can be performed in the web is a good I am I can use in one way this tablet 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.670
 Do you think 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.439
 For example 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.439
 Yes you want to shop 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.640
 Have you ne 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.640
 Oh dear 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:07.149
 See the video on youtube 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:09.729
 It is a tablet that is good at saying to see something information compared with there 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:14.569
 Because you can purchase 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:16.330
 It is recommended for those who want to take a quick look at the internet etc. 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:20.300
 after 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:25.980
 The drawback of tablets is 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:27.930
 Keyboard Because there is no physical keyboard, you can input data quickly. 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.020
 Not suitable for that I mean 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:34.180
 Because 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:36.480
 If you use it as a specialized terminal to view information, a tablet is recommended 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.480
 after 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:44.060
 Writing a program is basically impossible with this tablet at this stage 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:48.500
 Well, because it is 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:51.520
 People who want to write and study programs will also buy a computer instead of a tablet 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.520
 Recommend that 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:03:00.380
 Next 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:03.200
 It is a PC PC is divided into a desktop PC and a notebook computer 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:06.560
 So I also recommend 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:11.750
 It is a laptop and why is it a laptop? 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:13.010
 It 's the biggest because I can tell someone who I know and say and I know when I was in trouble 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.130
 It is recommended 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.430
 And advanced video editing 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:22.959
 This is the time that you want to 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:26.750
 I think I need a desktop computer that works at high speed, but that's right 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:31.820
 When not , a laptop is enough 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:36.530
 Although it is a drawback, laptops come in various sizes . 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:40.840
 It is depending on the wind and whether such things carry in 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.840
 I think you need to consider the size 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:49.959
 It's a tablet os but 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.010
 even those equipped with the say android os that google is making 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:56.620
 if there is 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:58.260
 There is also a device equipped with something called ios that apple is developing 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.000
 This also Well now have 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:05.640
 It is ipad Yes 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:11.280
 It seems like I told the story of Masha's note 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:15.360
 It is an ios device if the purpose of purchasing a PC or tablet is clear 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:18.989
 It does not matter even if it is an android device You can use anything 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:23.320
 How much price can you buy after that ? 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:26.040
 I think that comes also become a point where you say so 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:30.000
 If you say in the computer 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:36.030
 It divides into two roughly and is reflected here 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.610
 mac or mac of the rest is made in that I mean windows PC of the 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:42.330
 Besides 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:44.520
 but it's also a computer that has unix linux also this video 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.060
 Probably for everyone you see 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.880
 mac has windows land 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:52.210
 I think that will come to choose 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:56.740
 This is also the same as the previous tablet 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.790
 I think it's good if I can do what I want to do with windows or Mac 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:03.610
 I will 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:06.460
 Also because there advantages and disadvantages of I mean Tsu ease-of-use in the Mac is what I described windows 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.870
 Although the I mean bought a good does not say here 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:14.270
 You can also listen to the opinions of people around you 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:16.510
 I think it is not the current situation that there are overwhelmingly many windows users 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:20.090
 And then 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:24.980
 windows is windows xp windows vista 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:28.860
 windows 7 windows 8 windows 8.1 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:32.210
 On the various versions mixed variety os now 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.210
 Because there are people who use you 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:37.049
 Oh dear 

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:41.240
 It is not also not be willing to say little and very kana 

00:05:37.049 --> 00:05:45.370
 However, because the wind itself has many users 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.370
 I think that if you look for more detailed people are coming out soon 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:50.820
 Well, it's a personal story from here, though 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:06:04.450
 I am using hacks Tablets are using ipad 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:04.450
 I am taking this video with iphone 5 now 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:13.520
 Let's make it all into ios devices and os 10 devices 

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:15.569
 Very high affinity between devices 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:19.770
 Convenient 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:23.300
 You can see the common information anywhere on the iphone or ipad 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.300
 It is very convenient because it can 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:31.660
 It's a PC, but it's also a tablet, but there is something that is really cheap. 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:32.520
 Some are expensive 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:37.740
 so 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:40.680
 I feel like it is better to buy something expensive . 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:46.320
 That is not always that 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:48.940
 Budget I think you should buy it according to your own budget 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:52.849
 Because you buy a high computer 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:57.080
 It is not so to say that it is good 

00:06:52.849 --> 00:07:04.930
 Even if the price is low , I think it would be fine if you do what you want to do 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:08.289
 I think it is important to choose from among various opportunities firmly 

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:11.070
 This concludes this video 

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:11.070
 Thank you very much
