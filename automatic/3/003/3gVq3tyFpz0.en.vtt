hey<00:00:03.720> guys<00:00:03.929> in<00:00:04.170> this<00:00:04.259> video<00:00:04.380> I'm<00:00:04.560> going<00:00:04.650> to<00:00:04.740> be

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
hey guys in this video I'm going to be

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.710 
hey guys in this video I'm going to be
showing<00:00:04.980> you<00:00:05.220> exactly<00:00:05.640> how<00:00:05.910> to<00:00:05.970> be<00:00:06.150> exact<00:00:06.450> and

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
showing you exactly how to be exact and

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.210 
showing you exactly how to be exact and
in<00:00:06.779> order<00:00:06.990> to<00:00:07.109> do<00:00:07.230> that<00:00:07.379> in<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.740> sweet<00:00:08.040> image

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
in order to do that in the sweet image

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.370 
in order to do that in the sweet image
should<00:00:08.880> hopefully<00:00:09.120> help<00:00:09.510> to<00:00:09.750> better<00:00:10.200> your

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
should hopefully help to better your

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.620 
should hopefully help to better your
understanding<00:00:11.010> of<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.460> process<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.179> timing

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
understanding of the process and timing

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.820 
understanding of the process and timing
involved<00:00:12.900> so<00:00:13.139> you<00:00:13.230> see<00:00:13.349> down<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.559> bottom<00:00:13.769> here

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
involved so you see down the bottom here

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.189 
involved so you see down the bottom here
we've<00:00:13.980> got<00:00:14.099> time<00:00:14.340> goes<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.599> half<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.929> second

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
we've got time goes to half a second

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.450 
we've got time goes to half a second
input<00:00:16.680> here<00:00:17.070> so<00:00:17.279> b<00:00:17.550> XR<00:00:18.270> that's<00:00:18.720> merely<00:00:19.460> reload

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
input here so b XR that's merely reload

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.970 
input here so b XR that's merely reload
or<00:00:20.820> cancel<00:00:21.300> cancel<00:00:21.779> on<00:00:21.990> animation<00:00:22.289> cancel<00:00:22.890> on

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980

effects<00:00:23.369> in<00:00:23.939> our<00:00:24.180> is<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:25.050> do<00:00:25.140> damage<00:00:25.320> i<00:00:25.680> why

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
effects in our is to do damage i why

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.370 
effects in our is to do damage i why
your<00:00:26.580> gun<00:00:26.699> animation<00:00:27.630> so<00:00:27.900> we've<00:00:28.050> got<00:00:28.199> merely

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
your gun animation so we've got merely

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.980 
your gun animation so we've got merely
swing<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:28.890> then<00:00:28.949> fire<00:00:29.220> obviously<00:00:29.689> the<00:00:30.689> effect

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
swing and then fire obviously the effect

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.260 
swing and then fire obviously the effect
is<00:00:31.109> what<00:00:31.260> we're<00:00:31.380> after<00:00:31.500> so<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:32.520> frisbee<00:00:32.730> start

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
is what we're after so you frisbee start

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.520 
is what we're after so you frisbee start
lunging<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.750> then<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:33.930> do<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.140> melee<00:00:34.320> damage

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
lunging and then you do the melee damage

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.370 
lunging and then you do the melee damage
when<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.460> press<00:00:35.640> X<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.239> cancel<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.899> cooldown

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
when you press X you cancel the cooldown

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.500 
when you press X you cancel the cooldown
that<00:00:37.829> usually<00:00:38.309> happens<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.030> melee<00:00:39.210> so

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
that usually happens and the melee so

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.729 
that usually happens and the melee so
I'm<00:00:39.600> talking<00:00:39.750> about<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.079> Miglia<00:00:40.379> cooldown

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
I'm talking about the Miglia cooldown

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.040 
I'm talking about the Miglia cooldown
usually<00:00:41.489> you'd<00:00:41.640> go<00:00:41.820> lunch<00:00:42.059> your<00:00:42.570> merely<00:00:42.809> would

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
usually you'd go lunch your merely would

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.720 
usually you'd go lunch your merely would
connect<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.649> then<00:00:43.739> your<00:00:43.890> gun<00:00:44.070> would<00:00:44.250> reset

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
connect and then your gun would reset

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.279 
connect and then your gun would reset
which<00:00:45.030> takes<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.390> bit<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.539> time<00:00:45.660> what<00:00:46.170> we're

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
which takes a bit of time what we're

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.600 
which takes a bit of time what we're
going<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.469> do<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:46.710> cut<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:47.070> off<00:00:47.190> with<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.399> X

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
going to do is cut that off with the X

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.760 
going to do is cut that off with the X
so<00:00:48.360> canceling<00:00:49.050> merely<00:00:49.230> cool<00:00:49.440> down<00:00:49.590> there

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
so canceling merely cool down there

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.139 
so canceling merely cool down there
cific<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.309> happens<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:50.879> want<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.059> hit

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
cific that happens and you want to hit

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.180 
cific that happens and you want to hit
us<00:00:51.390> straight<00:00:51.930> after<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.440> they<00:00:52.980> will<00:00:53.129> start

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
us straight after that they will start

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.700 
us straight after that they will start
the<00:00:53.640> BR<00:00:54.239> damage<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.809> you'll<00:00:54.960> notice<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.440> time

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
the BR damage and you'll notice the time

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.639 
the BR damage and you'll notice the time
here<00:00:56.039> it's<00:00:56.489> about<00:00:56.789> what<00:00:57.120> point<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:58.050> seven<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.590> a

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
here it's about what point to seven of a

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.569 
here it's about what point to seven of a
second<00:00:59.100> two<00:00:59.430> point<00:01:00.300> three<00:01:00.510> it's<00:01:01.579> extremely

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
second two point three it's extremely

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.579 
second two point three it's extremely
small<00:01:03.000> time<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:03.629> that's<00:01:03.809> why<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:03.989> accounts<00:01:04.470> as

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
small time so that's why it accounts as

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.580 
small time so that's why it accounts as
kind<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:04.860> like<00:01:05.040> an<00:01:05.339> in<00:01:05.519> silico<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:06.470> what<00:01:07.470> you

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
kind of like an in silico and what you

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.440 
kind of like an in silico and what you
can<00:01:07.770> do<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.340> can<00:01:08.430> actually<00:01:08.610> go<00:01:08.880> be<00:01:09.150> and

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
can do is you can actually go be and

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.510 
can do is you can actually go be and
then<00:01:09.600> hold<00:01:09.900> our<00:01:10.140> down<00:01:10.470> then<00:01:10.740> hit<00:01:10.950> X<00:01:11.189> at<00:01:11.430> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
then hold our down then hit X at the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.219 
then hold our down then hit X at the
right<00:01:11.670> time<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.210> then<00:01:12.330> that'll<00:01:12.659> cause<00:01:12.869> us<00:01:13.080> to

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
right time and then that'll cause us to

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.840 
right time and then that'll cause us to
come<00:01:13.380> out<00:01:13.409> straight<00:01:13.740> away<00:01:13.799> which<00:01:14.430> can<00:01:14.700> be<00:01:14.820> a

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
come out straight away which can be a

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.460 
come out straight away which can be a
little<00:01:15.240> bit<00:01:15.330> faster<00:01:15.659> between<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.049> X<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.409> I

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
little bit faster between the X and I

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.530 
little bit faster between the X and I
and<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.830> also<00:01:16.979> if<00:01:17.369> you're<00:01:17.520> off<00:01:17.610> most<00:01:17.880> causes

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
and it also if you're off most causes

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.149 
and it also if you're off most causes
you<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.720> do<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.229> reload<00:01:19.500> glitch<00:01:19.770> that's<00:01:19.979> a

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
you to do the reload glitch that's a

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.800 
you to do the reload glitch that's a
really<00:01:20.400> good<00:01:20.580> which<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:20.939> very<00:01:21.450> handy<00:01:21.540> as<00:01:21.750> well

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
really good which is very handy as well

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.570 
really good which is very handy as well
that's<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.560> bit<00:01:22.710> harder<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:22.950> do<00:01:23.189> because<00:01:23.400> you

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
that's a bit harder to do because you

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.920 
that's a bit harder to do because you
kind<00:01:23.790> of<00:01:23.909> requires<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.299> bit<00:01:24.420> more<00:01:24.450> thinking<00:01:24.570> so

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
kind of requires a bit more thinking so

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.149 
kind of requires a bit more thinking so
if<00:01:24.990> you're<00:01:25.110> just<00:01:25.259> starting<00:01:25.439> off<00:01:25.619> just<00:01:25.890> stick

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
if you're just starting off just stick

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.890 
if you're just starting off just stick
with<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.400> normal<00:01:26.490> be<00:01:26.729> exert<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.420> what<00:01:27.780> we'll

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
with the normal be exert and what we'll

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.210 
with the normal be exert and what we'll
do<00:01:28.020> now<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.350> I'll<00:01:28.860> show<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.670> real<00:01:30.000> time

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
do now is I'll show you it in real time

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.399 
do now is I'll show you it in real time
so<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.310> all<00:01:32.400> happens<00:01:32.670> very<00:01:32.729> quickly<00:01:33.229> if<00:01:34.229> we're

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
so it all happens very quickly if we're

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.010 
so it all happens very quickly if we're
gonna<00:01:34.530> watch<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:34.950> in<00:01:35.100> slow<00:01:35.369> motion

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
gonna watch it in slow motion

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.249 
gonna watch it in slow motion
we'll<00:01:37.020> see<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.439> B<00:01:37.650> hits<00:01:37.920> I'm<00:01:38.369> lunging<00:01:39.259> merely

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
we'll see the B hits I'm lunging merely

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.090 
we'll see the B hits I'm lunging merely
connects<00:01:42.320> doesn't<00:01:43.320> show<00:01:43.470> very<00:01:43.500> clearly

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
connects doesn't show very clearly

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.649 
connects doesn't show very clearly
because<00:01:44.340> I'm<00:01:44.610> off<00:01:44.729> host<00:01:44.970> but<00:01:45.240> hizmet<00:01:45.630> has

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
because I'm off host but hizmet has

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.230 
because I'm off host but hizmet has
shields<00:01:46.409> being<00:01:46.560> removed<00:01:46.860> first<00:01:47.640> bullet<00:01:48.060> comes

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
shields being removed first bullet comes

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.210 
shields being removed first bullet comes
out<00:01:48.479> sick<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.079> bullet<00:01:49.290> comes<00:01:49.500> out<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:49.950> he's

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
out sick and bullet comes out and he's

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.069 
out sick and bullet comes out and he's
dead<00:01:50.430> already<00:01:50.670> after<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.479> second<00:01:51.780> bullet<00:01:51.930> and

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
dead already after the second bullet and

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.330 
dead already after the second bullet and
that's<00:01:52.200> because<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.530> did<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.680> momentum<00:01:53.159> based

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
that's because I did a momentum based

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.130 
that's because I did a momentum based
melee<00:01:53.610> so<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.030> jumped<00:01:54.390> up<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.659> ran<00:01:54.780> forward

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
melee so I jumped up and I ran forward

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.440 
melee so I jumped up and I ran forward
towards<00:01:55.439> them<00:01:55.560> took<00:01:56.159> off<00:01:56.310> more<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.180> shield

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
towards them took off more of a shield

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.420 
towards them took off more of a shield
allowing<00:01:57.869> me<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.020> kill<00:01:58.350> him<00:01:58.500> with<00:01:59.070> only<00:01:59.219> two

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
allowing me to kill him with only two

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.429 
allowing me to kill him with only two
bullets<00:01:59.670> as<00:01:59.909> opposed<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.540> standard<00:02:01.200> three

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
bullets as opposed to the standard three

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.170 
bullets as opposed to the standard three
bullets<00:02:01.770> if<00:02:02.009> you're<00:02:02.490> staying<00:02:02.640> still<00:02:02.969> or<00:02:03.119> if

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
bullets if you're staying still or if

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.550

someone's lunch towards you and push you

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.319 
someone's lunch towards you and push you
backwards<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.460> will<00:02:05.520> require<00:02:05.909> all<00:02:05.939> three

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
backwards it will require all three

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.670 
backwards it will require all three
bullets<00:02:06.600> making<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:06.990> bit<00:02:07.110> slow<00:02:07.320> so<00:02:07.530> in<00:02:07.590> a

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
bullets making it a bit slow so in a

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.290 
bullets making it a bit slow so in a
competitive<00:02:08.160> match<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.849> want<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.090> do<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.209> as

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
competitive match you want to do it as

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.460 
competitive match you want to do it as
fast<00:02:09.390> as<00:02:09.569> possible<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:10.050> need<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.229> get<00:02:10.349> that

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
fast as possible you need to get that

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.540 
fast as possible you need to get that
edge<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.619> know<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:10.950> need<00:02:11.099> to<00:02:11.190> pull<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.459> off

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
edge you know you need to pull it off

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.600 
edge you know you need to pull it off
faster<00:02:11.879> than<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.060> other<00:02:12.209> person

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
faster than the other person

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.310 
faster than the other person
so<00:02:12.940> running<00:02:13.360> forward<00:02:13.690> and<00:02:13.780> making<00:02:13.990> sure<00:02:14.170> that

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
so running forward and making sure that

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.140 
so running forward and making sure that
you're<00:02:14.470> pushing<00:02:14.830> forward<00:02:15.280> when<00:02:15.550> you<00:02:15.700> do<00:02:16.000> it

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
you're pushing forward when you do it

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.330 
you're pushing forward when you do it
and<00:02:16.390> we're<00:02:16.510> sure<00:02:16.660> you<00:02:16.780> do<00:02:16.900> it<00:02:16.990> faster<00:02:17.410> or<00:02:17.950> if

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
and we're sure you do it faster or if

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.500 
and we're sure you do it faster or if
you<00:02:18.490> can<00:02:18.700> like<00:02:18.970> if<00:02:19.090> you<00:02:19.150> coming<00:02:19.300> through<00:02:19.450> a

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
you can like if you coming through a

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.090 
you can like if you coming through a
doorway<00:02:19.720> or<00:02:19.810> going<00:02:20.020> around<00:02:20.170> a<00:02:20.260> corner<00:02:20.410> or<00:02:20.890> if

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
doorway or going around a corner or if

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.590 
doorway or going around a corner or if
you<00:02:21.190> pull<00:02:21.400> off<00:02:21.490> a<00:02:21.670> falling<00:02:22.030> merely<00:02:22.210> somehow

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
you pull off a falling merely somehow

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.360 
you pull off a falling merely somehow
which<00:02:22.780> can't<00:02:23.050> be<00:02:23.080> hard<00:02:23.260> to<00:02:23.320> do<00:02:23.470> but<00:02:23.500> it<00:02:23.830> pulls

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
which can't be hard to do but it pulls

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.100 
which can't be hard to do but it pulls
off<00:02:24.580> more<00:02:24.880> of<00:02:24.970> this<00:02:25.090> shield<00:02:25.390> I<00:02:25.630> think<00:02:25.990> at<00:02:26.050> the

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
off more of this shield I think at the

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.270 
off more of this shield I think at the
police<00:02:26.290> their<00:02:26.470> entire<00:02:26.710> shield<00:02:26.950> actually

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
police their entire shield actually

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.220 
police their entire shield actually
allowing<00:02:27.550> the<00:02:27.910> first<00:02:28.180> bullet<00:02:28.510> to<00:02:28.690> kill<00:02:28.840> them

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
allowing the first bullet to kill them

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.410 
allowing the first bullet to kill them
so<00:02:29.350> that's<00:02:29.650> literally<00:02:29.980> instant<00:02:30.460> kill<00:02:30.700> common

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
so that's literally instant kill common

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.590 
so that's literally instant kill common
mistakes<00:02:31.810> is<00:02:32.080> canceling<00:02:33.070> too<00:02:33.250> soon<00:02:33.520> so<00:02:33.730> if<00:02:34.420> I

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
mistakes is canceling too soon so if I

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.390 
mistakes is canceling too soon so if I
was<00:02:34.720> here<00:02:34.900> and<00:02:35.050> I<00:02:35.080> press<00:02:35.260> X<00:02:35.560> then<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.190> melee

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
was here and I press X then the melee

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.220 
was here and I press X then the melee
damage<00:02:36.610> wouldn't<00:02:37.060> connect<00:02:37.390> causing<00:02:37.960> you<00:02:38.050> to

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
damage wouldn't connect causing you to

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.480 
damage wouldn't connect causing you to
lunge<00:02:38.470> and<00:02:38.770> do<00:02:39.100> nothing

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
lunge and do nothing

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.210 
lunge and do nothing
and<00:02:39.640> then<00:02:40.390> just<00:02:40.630> fire<00:02:40.810> them<00:02:41.110> this<00:02:41.890> usually

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
and then just fire them this usually

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.220 
and then just fire them this usually
gets<00:02:42.310> you<00:02:42.460> killed<00:02:42.640> because<00:02:43.120> you've<00:02:43.750> lunch<00:02:43.990> and

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
gets you killed because you've lunch and

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.420 
gets you killed because you've lunch and
haven't<00:02:44.440> done<00:02:44.530> any<00:02:44.680> damage<00:02:44.830> they<00:02:45.280> usually

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
haven't done any damage they usually

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.910 
haven't done any damage they usually
lunge<00:02:45.820> as<00:02:46.000> well<00:02:46.180> taking<00:02:46.510> shirt<00:02:46.720> off<00:02:46.900> game<00:02:47.620> over

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
lunge as well taking shirt off game over

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.920 
lunge as well taking shirt off game over
if<00:02:48.310> you<00:02:48.730> want<00:02:48.850> to<00:02:48.910> practice<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.270> timing<00:02:49.690> which

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
if you want to practice the timing which

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.630 
if you want to practice the timing which
is<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.200> hard<00:02:50.380> part<00:02:50.530> so<00:02:50.740> getting<00:02:50.920> this<00:02:51.070> X<00:02:51.340> are

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
is the hard part so getting this X are

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.280 
is the hard part so getting this X are
straight<00:02:52.209> after<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.540> melee<00:02:52.720> damage<00:02:52.870> that's

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
straight after the melee damage that's

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.050 
straight after the melee damage that's
that's<00:02:53.680> where<00:02:53.860> the<00:02:53.950> skill<00:02:54.190> lies<00:02:54.400> that's<00:02:54.880> where

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
that's where the skill lies that's where

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.280 
that's where the skill lies that's where
people<00:02:55.270> will<00:02:55.390> ask<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.660> questions<00:02:55.990> how<00:02:56.140> to<00:02:56.170> eat

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
people will ask the questions how to eat

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.750
