00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.760
 or maybe 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.410
 And so to wind the hair on the iron 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:35.640
 first rule hair must be very 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.640
 well dried them should not stay 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.180
 not the slightest drop of moisture 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:46.290
 they must be closely bound to two 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.600
 some kind of account for them but this protection 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.570
 should also not moisturize and 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.519
 recently this is protection being wet 5 this 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.360
 everyone should dry thoroughly 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:59.910
 2 beds juice should be a little bit 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:04.940
 its temperature is higher than boom 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:08.190
 just drink hair and so here i am 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.530
 gathered this top hair up to 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.450
 but since my hair is thick to me 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:18.720
 there are 3 rows 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:25.100
 they are on the hook showing we take a strand than 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:31.290
 the thinner the redder will be the iron 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:34.040
 make a loop turn the iron and the corners 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.040
 thrust 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:48.820
 here it turns out such a block 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:59.240
 quince . and how do we wind 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.240
 all hair 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.630
 when 7 so you can see 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.510
 I'll screw it up so to speak 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:15.450
 it turns out how to roll a burn 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:19.920
 a little warmer already smoother 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:26.300
 gliding over to 1 case i have like that punch 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:26.300
 my lots ghoul smoothly 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.870
 often scorching when 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.700
 them to cancers not dwell on the east 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:16.700
 studied 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:19.340
 here are such curls so I wrap all 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.709
 hair only this twist like that 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.260
 that's the way Nicholas ports Loss three 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:28.280
 rows in something just a horseshoe wind up and 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:31.930
 the neighborhood will effect now I'm screwed up 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:39.260
 all the hair and show the picture strip and 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:51.169
 that's what happened now i'm doing my bouffant 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:53.080
 it is this that is all smooth to receive 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:57.740
 plain 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:59.620
 like using ironing varnish and the same brush you 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:03.460
 can do this haircut 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.460
 I hope you enjoyed it
