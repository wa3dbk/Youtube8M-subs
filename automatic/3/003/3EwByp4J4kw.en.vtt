okay<00:00:01.199> so<00:00:01.530> after<00:00:01.860> we<00:00:01.949> did<00:00:02.100> our<00:00:02.280> passes

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
okay so after we did our passes

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.999 
okay so after we did our passes
combination<00:00:03.570> in<00:00:03.750> Photoshop<00:00:04.319> we<00:00:04.500> need<00:00:04.890> to

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
combination in Photoshop we need to

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.070 
combination in Photoshop we need to
start<00:00:05.250> and<00:00:05.460> add<00:00:05.730> photorealistic<00:00:06.299> look<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:06.930> our

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
start and add photorealistic look to our

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.400 
start and add photorealistic look to our
3d<00:00:07.560> rendering<00:00:07.950> so<00:00:08.820> how<00:00:09.090> do<00:00:09.240> we<00:00:09.389> do<00:00:09.540> it<00:00:09.570> the

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
3d rendering so how do we do it the

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.560 
3d rendering so how do we do it the
first<00:00:10.590> step<00:00:10.889> is<00:00:11.130> of<00:00:11.580> course<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:12.150> add<00:00:12.179> an

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
first step is of course to add an

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.709 
first step is of course to add an
ambient<00:00:13.200> occlusion<00:00:13.320> pass<00:00:14.120> this<00:00:15.120> can<00:00:15.389> be<00:00:15.509> done

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
ambient occlusion pass this can be done

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.769 
ambient occlusion pass this can be done

to select your camera and to increase

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.350 
to select your camera and to increase
the<00:01:02.910> shutter<00:01:03.840> speed<00:01:04.110> or<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.559> film<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.129> oh<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.549> go

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
the shutter speed or the film is oh I go

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.880 
the shutter speed or the film is oh I go
basically<00:01:06.780> with<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.140> film<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.560> oh<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:08.659> give

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
basically with the film is oh I give

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:16.640 
basically with the film is oh I give
1000<00:01:12.200> 1200<00:01:13.520> or<00:01:14.520> just<00:01:15.119> 1000<00:01:15.869> can<00:01:16.049> be<00:01:16.170> just<00:01:16.409> fine

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
1000 1200 or just 1000 can be just fine

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.910 
1000 1200 or just 1000 can be just fine
with<00:01:16.680> ezel<00:01:17.659> then<00:01:18.659> your<00:01:18.869> image<00:01:19.290> will<00:01:19.770> be

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
with ezel then your image will be

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.920 
with ezel then your image will be
rendered<00:01:21.049> very<00:01:22.049> brightly<00:01:22.670> I<00:01:23.670> think<00:01:24.390> it's

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
rendered very brightly I think it's

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.130 
rendered very brightly I think it's
because<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.500> we're<00:01:25.710> using<00:01:25.890> gamma<00:01:26.250> 2.2<00:01:27.140> if

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
because that we're using gamma 2.2 if

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.830 
because that we're using gamma 2.2 if
you<00:01:28.380> just<00:01:28.619> regularly<00:01:29.549> start<00:01:29.880> rendering<00:01:30.270> your

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
you just regularly start rendering your

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.929 
you just regularly start rendering your
ambient<00:01:31.500> occlusion<00:01:31.680> pass<00:01:32.040> will<00:01:32.310> be<00:01:32.430> very<00:01:32.640> dark

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
ambient occlusion pass will be very dark

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.990 
ambient occlusion pass will be very dark
so<00:01:33.689> therefore<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.380> increase<00:01:35.070> my<00:01:35.159> film<00:01:35.670> in<00:01:35.850> so

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
so therefore I increase my film in so

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.749 
so therefore I increase my film in so
speed<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.450> my<00:01:37.200> image<00:01:37.500> becomes<00:01:37.890> my<00:01:38.280> error<00:01:38.460> my

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
speed and my image becomes my error my

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.600 
speed and my image becomes my error my
ambient<00:01:39.150> occlusion<00:01:39.329> pass<00:01:39.840> rendered<00:01:40.610> just

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
ambient occlusion pass rendered just

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.429 
ambient occlusion pass rendered just
fine<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:42.439> mean<00:01:43.439> really<00:01:44.570> lightened<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.780> exposed

as<00:05:07.600> you<00:05:07.690> see<00:05:07.900> here<00:05:08.260> we<00:05:08.590> are<00:05:08.889> removing<00:05:09.580> all<00:05:10.680> the

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
as you see here we are removing all the

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.920 
as you see here we are removing all the
white<00:05:11.889> colors<00:05:12.430> adding<00:05:13.120> a<00:05:13.150> little<00:05:13.720> bit

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
white colors adding a little bit

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.760 
white colors adding a little bit
darkness<00:05:14.620> a<00:05:14.860> little<00:05:15.310> bit<00:05:15.430> dark<00:05:15.789> tones<00:05:16.620> to<00:05:17.620> our

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
darkness a little bit dark tones to our

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.170 
darkness a little bit dark tones to our
shadows<00:05:18.310> something<00:05:19.120> like<00:05:19.419> that<00:05:19.660> and<00:05:21.000> the<00:05:22.000> last

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
shadows something like that and the last

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.020 
shadows something like that and the last
thing<00:05:22.419> is<00:05:22.690> of<00:05:23.139> course<00:05:23.700> reducing<00:05:24.700> the<00:05:24.880> opacity

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
thing is of course reducing the opacity

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:30.690 
thing is of course reducing the opacity
of<00:05:25.780> this<00:05:26.470> layer<00:05:27.780> something<00:05:28.780> like<00:05:28.900> this<00:05:29.700> could

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:30.700 
of this layer something like this could

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.420 
of this layer something like this could
be<00:05:30.729> just<00:05:31.150> fine

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.290 

I<00:05:35.440> don't<00:05:36.440> suggest<00:05:36.680> you<00:05:37.100> to<00:05:37.280> go<00:05:37.460> beyond<00:05:37.850> 50

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
I don't suggest you to go beyond 50

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.500 
I don't suggest you to go beyond 50
percent<00:05:38.780> of<00:05:39.050> capacity<00:05:39.580> of<00:05:40.580> course<00:05:41.000> it<00:05:41.180> depends

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
percent of capacity of course it depends

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:46.810 
percent of capacity of course it depends
on<00:05:41.660> your<00:05:41.810> scene<00:05:42.220> but<00:05:43.750> about<00:05:44.860> 25<00:05:45.860> 26<00:05:46.400> percent

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
on your scene but about 25 26 percent

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.950 
on your scene but about 25 26 percent
could<00:05:47.330> be<00:05:47.450> just<00:05:47.720> fine<00:05:47.960> and<00:05:49.390> the<00:05:50.390> last<00:05:50.570> thing<00:05:50.750> is

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
could be just fine and the last thing is

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.640 
could be just fine and the last thing is
adding<00:05:51.350> a<00:05:51.440> mask<00:05:52.090> to<00:05:53.090> this<00:05:53.210> layer<00:05:53.270> and<00:05:53.930> of

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650 
adding a mask to this layer and of

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:59.380 
adding a mask to this layer and of
course<00:05:55.210> removing<00:05:57.010> the<00:05:58.010> ambient<00:05:58.430> pass<00:05:58.700> from

00:05:59.380 --> 00:05:59.390 
course removing the ambient pass from

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.140 
course removing the ambient pass from
all<00:05:59.660> unnecessary<00:06:00.320> places<00:06:01.280> like<00:06:01.580> this<00:06:01.820> trees

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.150 
all unnecessary places like this trees

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:13.150 
all unnecessary places like this trees
here<00:06:03.310> and<00:06:05.290> these<00:06:06.290> trees<00:06:06.800> here<00:06:07.340> as<00:06:07.430> well<00:06:12.160> you

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:13.160 
here and these trees here as well you

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:21.790 
here and these trees here as well you
can<00:06:13.370> use<00:06:13.580> also<00:06:13.940> great<00:06:14.900> gray<00:06:15.500> colors<00:06:17.770> so<00:06:20.800> the

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:21.800 
can use also great gray colors so the

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.420 
can use also great gray colors so the
transition<00:06:22.280> will<00:06:23.030> be<00:06:23.210> much<00:06:23.540> more<00:06:23.840> smoother

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430 
transition will be much more smoother

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:30.160 
transition will be much more smoother
something<00:06:25.430> like<00:06:25.580> this<00:06:26.710> work<00:06:27.710> just<00:06:27.770> fine<00:06:29.170> and

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:30.170 
something like this work just fine and

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.340 
something like this work just fine and
voila<00:06:30.470> we<00:06:30.830> got<00:06:31.370> our<00:06:31.610> first<00:06:32.360> step<00:06:32.870> to<00:06:33.200> the

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:33.350 
voila we got our first step to the

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:37.060 
voila we got our first step to the
photorealistic<00:06:33.860> image<00:06:34.640> look<00:06:35.860> let's<00:06:36.860> just

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:37.070 
photorealistic image look let's just

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.930 
photorealistic image look let's just
hide<00:06:37.400> and<00:06:37.840> unhide<00:06:39.160> you<00:06:40.160> see<00:06:40.370> here<00:06:40.670> we<00:06:40.850> are

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:40.940 
hide and unhide you see here we are

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.560 
hide and unhide you see here we are
getting<00:06:41.150> much<00:06:41.630> more<00:06:41.870> better<00:06:43.360> much<00:06:44.360> more

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:44.570 
getting much more better much more

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:48.790 
getting much more better much more
softer<00:06:44.990> lighting<00:06:45.950> on<00:06:46.430> the<00:06:46.670> corners<00:06:47.120> and<00:06:47.800> our

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 
softer lighting on the corners and our

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.480 
softer lighting on the corners and our
objects<00:06:49.580> and<00:06:49.850> our<00:06:50.090> models<00:06:50.890> got<00:06:51.890> much<00:06:52.220> more

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:52.490 
objects and our models got much more

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:58.090 
objects and our models got much more
accurate<00:06:53.120> shadows<00:06:53.900> going<00:06:54.200> around<00:06:54.680> them<00:06:57.100> just

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:58.100 
accurate shadows going around them just

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.840 
accurate shadows going around them just
one<00:06:58.310> more<00:06:58.430> time<00:06:59.950> something<00:07:00.950> like<00:07:00.980> that<00:07:01.370> this

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:01.850 
one more time something like that this

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:04.480 
one more time something like that this
was<00:07:02.030> before<00:07:02.560> this<00:07:03.560> is<00:07:03.740> how<00:07:03.890> it<00:07:04.010> looks<00:07:04.220> now

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:04.490 
was before this is how it looks now

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.690 
was before this is how it looks now
voila<00:07:05.380> much<00:07:06.380> more<00:07:06.620> better<00:07:06.770> colors<00:07:07.250> much

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:07.700 
voila much more better colors much

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.780 
voila much more better colors much
better<00:07:08.090> distribution<00:07:08.800> one<00:07:09.800> tip<00:07:10.010> you<00:07:10.280> can

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:10.790 
better distribution one tip you can

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:15.120 
better distribution one tip you can
always<00:07:11.030> do<00:07:11.420> a<00:07:11.450> little<00:07:12.200> bit<00:07:13.060> lighter<00:07:14.060> your

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:15.130 
always do a little bit lighter your

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.250 
always do a little bit lighter your
image<00:07:16.130> so<00:07:17.060> by<00:07:17.270> adding<00:07:17.540> an<00:07:17.810> ambient<00:07:18.200> occlusion

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:18.260 
image so by adding an ambient occlusion

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.070 
image so by adding an ambient occlusion
pass<00:07:18.770> you<00:07:19.070> can<00:07:19.100> darken<00:07:19.850> all<00:07:20.390> your<00:07:20.600> lightened

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:21.080 
pass you can darken all your lightened

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:25.060 
pass you can darken all your lightened
areas<00:07:21.850> so<00:07:22.850> your<00:07:23.060> image<00:07:24.020> will<00:07:24.260> look<00:07:24.380> much<00:07:24.920> more

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:25.070 
areas so your image will look much more

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:28.420 
areas so your image will look much more
perfectly<00:07:25.610> okay<00:07:26.420> so<00:07:26.660> this<00:07:27.290> is<00:07:27.470> it<00:07:27.620> check<00:07:28.310> out

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:28.430 
perfectly okay so this is it check out

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:32.000 
perfectly okay so this is it check out
the<00:07:28.610> next<00:07:28.820> video<00:07:29.120> the<00:07:29.540> next<00:07:29.750> step

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:32.010
