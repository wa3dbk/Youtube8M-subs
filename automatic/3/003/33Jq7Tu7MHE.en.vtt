it did is there is no need for
background<00:01:19.530> colors<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.490> can<00:01:20.670> just<00:01:20.700> delete

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
background colors so you can just delete

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.440 
background colors so you can just delete
that<00:01:21.229> no<00:01:22.229> need<00:01:22.380> for<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:24.060> have<00:01:24.210> four

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
that no need for this so you have four

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.550 
that no need for this so you have four
swords<00:01:24.900> perfectly<00:01:26.210> placed<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.450> here<00:01:27.689> so<00:01:28.439> the

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
swords perfectly placed in here so the

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.990 
swords perfectly placed in here so the
innovation<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.070> going<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.280> go<00:01:29.369> smoothly<00:01:29.729> and

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
innovation is going to go smoothly and

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.539 
innovation is going to go smoothly and
not<00:01:30.240> like<00:01:30.869> up<00:01:31.020> or<00:01:31.229> whatever<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:32.340> what

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.030 
make it smaller yeah this is just just
the<00:02:17.960> way<00:02:18.050> you<00:02:18.110> want<00:02:18.320> to<00:02:18.380> do<00:02:18.440> it<00:02:18.560> not<00:02:18.860> like

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
the way you want to do it not like

something<00:02:19.280> like<00:02:19.490> this<00:02:19.580> this<00:02:19.730> obviously

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
something like this this obviously

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.100

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
then obviously the same to the other one

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.320 
then obviously the same to the other one
but<00:02:27.770> with<00:02:28.130> a<00:02:28.160> good<00:02:28.370> animation<00:02:28.820> of<00:02:28.910> course<00:02:29.120> not

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
but with a good animation of course not

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.270 
but with a good animation of course not
just<00:02:30.070> well<00:02:31.070> that<00:02:31.520> yeah<00:02:31.910> and<00:02:32.860> just<00:02:33.860> change<00:02:34.130> it

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
just well that yeah and just change it

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.770 
just well that yeah and just change it
the<00:02:34.370> way<00:02:34.459> you<00:02:34.520> want<00:02:34.730> it<00:02:34.760> to<00:02:34.910> be<00:02:34.940> so<00:02:35.330> it's<00:02:35.630> going

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
the way you want it to be so it's going

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.030 
the way you want it to be so it's going
to<00:02:35.840> be<00:02:35.900> a<00:02:35.959> frame<00:02:36.230> 1<00:02:36.470> this<00:02:36.680> is<00:02:36.800> going<00:02:36.920> to<00:02:36.980> be

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
to be a frame 1 this is going to be

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.350 
to be a frame 1 this is going to be
pretty<00:02:37.220> too<00:02:37.459> i<00:02:37.520> don't<00:02:37.610> know<00:02:37.820> whatever<00:02:38.000> you

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
pretty too i don't know whatever you

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.240 
pretty too i don't know whatever you
want<00:02:38.570> to<00:02:38.660> make<00:02:38.810> this<00:02:39.620> is<00:02:39.800> really<00:02:40.010> a<00:02:40.100> bad

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
want to make this is really a bad

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.150 
want to make this is really a bad
example<00:02:40.570> maybe<00:02:41.570> I<00:02:41.690> could<00:02:42.130> do<00:02:43.130> something

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
example maybe I could do something

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.199 
example maybe I could do something
better<00:02:45.100> but<00:02:46.100> I<00:02:46.160> don't<00:02:46.610> actually<00:02:46.730> have<00:02:47.060> the

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
better but I don't actually have the

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.150 
better but I don't actually have the
file<00:02:47.390> of<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.660> sword<00:02:47.900> in<00:02:47.989> here<00:02:48.200> that's<00:02:48.920> why<00:02:49.130> I

file of the sword in here that's why I

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.310 
file of the sword in here that's why I
can't<00:02:49.430> really<00:02:49.610> select<00:02:50.000> parts<00:02:50.959> that<00:02:51.080> I<00:02:51.200> was

like two tix not upon you just go like

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.440 
like two tix not upon you just go like
that<00:04:00.080> and<00:04:00.290> it's<00:04:00.530> going<00:04:00.650> to<00:04:00.709> be<00:04:00.860> that<00:04:01.760> that

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
that and it's going to be that that

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.240 
that and it's going to be that that
frame<00:04:02.959> is<00:04:03.140> going<00:04:03.320> to<00:04:03.410> last<00:04:03.560> longer<00:04:03.860> than<00:04:04.010> the

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
frame is going to last longer than the

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.729 
frame is going to last longer than the
others<00:04:04.519> you<00:04:05.209> can<00:04:05.360> do<00:04:05.480> that<00:04:05.630> so<00:04:06.290> many<00:04:06.350> times<00:04:06.590> as

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
others you can do that so many times as

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.509 
others you can do that so many times as
you<00:04:06.829> want<00:04:07.090> well<00:04:08.829> like<00:04:09.829> that<00:04:10.070> and<00:04:10.310> then<00:04:10.489> just

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
you want well like that and then just

you want well like that and then just
like<00:04:10.940> to<00:04:11.120> turtle<00:04:11.390> s<00:04:11.570> to<00:04:12.049> save<00:04:12.230> this

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
like to turtle s to save this

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.970 
like to turtle s to save this
that's<00:04:13.879> that<00:04:14.120> the<00:04:14.569> sword<00:04:14.810> should<00:04:14.989> work<00:04:15.230> I<00:04:15.530> mean
