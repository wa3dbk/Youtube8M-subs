for<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.119> think<00:01:30.600> twenty<00:01:31.380> three<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.890> twenty<00:01:31.920> five

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
for I think twenty three to twenty five

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.850 
for I think twenty three to twenty five
hundred<00:01:32.670> dollars<00:01:33.229> they<00:01:34.229> go<00:01:34.439> over<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.650> whole

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
hundred dollars they go over a whole

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.560 
hundred dollars they go over a whole
process<00:01:35.369> on<00:01:35.549> what<00:01:35.729> they<00:01:35.850> do<00:01:35.909> with<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.240> engine

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
process on what they do with the engine

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.460 
process on what they do with the engine
because<00:01:37.409> these<00:01:37.619> motors<00:01:38.040> were<00:01:38.189> known<00:01:38.400> for

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
because these motors were known for

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.440 
because these motors were known for
heating<00:01:40.470> up<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.770> oil<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.820> oil<00:01:41.850> becoming

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
heating up the oil and the oil becoming

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.840 
heating up the oil and the oil becoming
sludge<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.170> clogging<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.649> oil<00:01:44.070> passageways

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
sludge and clogging the oil passageways

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.109 
sludge and clogging the oil passageways
so<00:01:45.140> what<00:01:46.140> they<00:01:46.290> do<00:01:46.350> is<00:01:46.710> they<00:01:46.950> they<00:01:47.369> make<00:01:47.970> the

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
so what they do is they they make the

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.870 
so what they do is they they make the
oil<00:01:48.149> passageways<00:01:49.049> bigger<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.860> they<00:01:50.460> fix<00:01:50.729> a

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
oil passageways bigger and they fix a

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.810 
oil passageways bigger and they fix a
lot<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.240> problems<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.649> engine<00:01:53.399> had<00:01:53.579> with

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
lot of problems that the engine had with

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.660 
lot of problems that the engine had with
sludge<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.659> timing<00:01:55.560> chain<00:01:55.799> problems<00:01:56.399> and

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
sludge and timing chain problems and

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.350 
sludge and timing chain problems and
water<00:01:56.939> pump<00:01:57.299> issues<00:01:58.670> you<00:01:59.670> could<00:01:59.820> find<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.210> on

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
water pump issues you could find that on

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.330 
water pump issues you could find that on
eBay<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:02.899> I'm<00:02:03.899> sure<00:02:04.200> you're<00:02:04.860> here<00:02:05.070> now<00:02:05.280> you

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.130 
did a lot of research on these engine
and<00:02:08.070> from<00:02:09.070> it<00:02:10.030> seems<00:02:10.390> that<00:02:10.570> from<00:02:10.720> what<00:02:10.869> I<00:02:10.900> read

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
and from it seems that from what I read

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.210

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
one ounce of sludge in the motor so I

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.200 
one ounce of sludge in the motor so I
can<00:04:32.470> I<00:04:32.680> can't<00:04:33.040> think<00:04:33.280> of<00:04:33.430> why<00:04:33.699> the<00:04:33.760> bearings

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
can I can't think of why the bearings

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.050 
can I can't think of why the bearings
failed<00:04:34.650> but<00:04:35.650> I<00:04:35.680> replaced<00:04:36.130> all<00:04:36.340> the<00:04:36.370> bearings

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
failed but I replaced all the bearings

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.469 
failed but I replaced all the bearings
I<00:04:37.290> checked<00:04:38.290> the<00:04:38.410> water<00:04:38.620> pump<00:04:39.000> water<00:04:40.000> pump<00:04:40.330> is

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 
I checked the water pump water pump is

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:42.060 
I checked the water pump water pump is
not<00:04:40.660> leaking

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
not leaking

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.860 
not leaking
I<00:04:42.100> checked<00:04:42.970> the<00:04:43.650> the<00:04:44.650> timing<00:04:45.370> belt<00:04:45.610> tensioner

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
I checked the the timing belt tensioner

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.070 
I checked the the timing belt tensioner
it<00:04:46.870> was<00:04:47.050> out<00:04:47.260> just<00:04:47.560> a<00:04:47.740> tiny<00:04:47.889> bit<00:04:48.190> like<00:04:48.370> this<00:04:49.080> it

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
it was out just a tiny bit like this it

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.860 
it was out just a tiny bit like this it
really<00:04:50.550> there's<00:04:51.550> really<00:04:51.729> no<00:04:52.060> reason<00:04:52.360> for<00:04:52.780> the

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
really there's really no reason for the

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.790 
really there's really no reason for the
motor<00:04:53.310> to<00:04:54.310> have<00:04:54.490> failed<00:04:54.820> so<00:04:55.479> I<00:04:55.780> can't<00:04:56.560> blame<00:04:56.770> it

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
motor to have failed so I can't blame it

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.890 
motor to have failed so I can't blame it
on<00:04:57.010> the<00:04:57.130> sludge<00:04:57.400> I<00:04:57.699> can't<00:04:57.910> blame<00:04:58.150> it<00:04:58.180> on<00:04:58.419> the

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
on the sludge I can't blame it on the

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:59.790 
on the sludge I can't blame it on the
water<00:04:59.199> pump

I<00:04:59.830> tried<00:05:00.580> everything<00:05:00.880> I<00:05:01.330> mean<00:05:01.870> I<00:05:01.990> looked<00:05:02.410> into

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
I tried everything I mean I looked into

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.219 
I tried everything I mean I looked into
everything<00:05:03.010> I<00:05:03.100> couldn't<00:05:03.340> find<00:05:03.550> anything<00:05:04.229> so

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:05.229 
everything I couldn't find anything so

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:08.640 
everything I couldn't find anything so
when<00:05:05.800> I<00:05:05.830> replaced<00:05:06.280> it<00:05:06.810> started<00:05:07.810> it<00:05:07.900> up<00:05:08.050> it<00:05:08.530> was

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
when I replaced it started it up it was

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.100 
when I replaced it started it up it was
good<00:05:08.860> for<00:05:09.130> but<00:05:09.340> I<00:05:09.610> don't<00:05:10.360> know<00:05:10.479> a<00:05:10.690> couple<00:05:10.990> of

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
good for but I don't know a couple of

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.779 
good for but I don't know a couple of
minutes<00:05:11.440> and<00:05:11.590> then<00:05:11.710> the<00:05:11.860> knock<00:05:12.039> started<00:05:12.610> right

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:12.789 
minutes and then the knock started right

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:15.540 
minutes and then the knock started right
back<00:05:13.000> up<00:05:13.240> again<00:05:13.570> but<00:05:13.930> it<00:05:14.590> was<00:05:14.710> a<00:05:14.740> very<00:05:14.949> knock

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
back up again but it was a very knock

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.439 
back up again but it was a very knock
was<00:05:15.760> very<00:05:15.970> subtle<00:05:16.449> it<00:05:17.080> wasn't<00:05:17.880> it<00:05:18.880> wasn't<00:05:19.060> you

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:19.449 
was very subtle it wasn't it wasn't you

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:21.360 
was very subtle it wasn't it wasn't you
know<00:05:19.539> you<00:05:19.900> know<00:05:20.020> huge<00:05:20.440> loud<00:05:20.740> knock<00:05:21.010> there<00:05:21.280> was

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
know you know huge loud knock there was

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.550 
know you know huge loud knock there was
no<00:05:21.520> power<00:05:21.760> loss<00:05:22.110> but<00:05:23.110> the<00:05:23.260> only<00:05:23.350> difference

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
no power loss but the only difference

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.250 
no power loss but the only difference
the<00:05:24.039> only<00:05:24.100> difference<00:05:24.250> was<00:05:24.849> when<00:05:25.570> I<00:05:25.630> drove<00:05:26.050> it

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.260 
the only difference was when I drove it

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.279 
the only difference was when I drove it
on<00:05:27.010> high<00:05:27.700> rpms<00:05:28.270> you<00:05:28.570> would<00:05:28.780> hear<00:05:28.930> the<00:05:29.080> knock

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:29.289 
on high rpms you would hear the knock

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:31.830 
on high rpms you would hear the knock
pretty<00:05:29.650> loud<00:05:29.889> but<00:05:30.700> while<00:05:31.030> the<00:05:31.210> engine<00:05:31.539> was<00:05:31.720> on

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
pretty loud but while the engine was on

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.700 
pretty loud but while the engine was on
the<00:05:31.990> load<00:05:32.200> you<00:05:32.979> wouldn't<00:05:33.280> hear<00:05:33.430> it<00:05:33.460> and<00:05:34.590> it<00:05:35.590> was

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
the load you wouldn't hear it and it was

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.270 
the load you wouldn't hear it and it was
good<00:05:35.950> I<00:05:36.250> put<00:05:36.970> about<00:05:37.410> 360<00:05:38.410> miles<00:05:38.620> on<00:05:38.979> the<00:05:39.099> car

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
good I put about 360 miles on the car

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.670 
good I put about 360 miles on the car
before<00:05:39.610> it<00:05:39.880> finally<00:05:40.389> went<00:05:40.599> and<00:05:40.960> what<00:05:41.410> I<00:05:41.440> mean

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
before it finally went and what I mean

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.860 
before it finally went and what I mean
by<00:05:41.800> went<00:05:42.099> is<00:05:42.310> the<00:05:42.340> knock<00:05:42.760> came<00:05:43.120> back<00:05:43.330> so<00:05:43.570> loud

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
by went is the knock came back so loud

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.719 
by went is the knock came back so loud
that<00:05:43.900> if<00:05:44.380> I<00:05:44.500> drove<00:05:44.770> it<00:05:44.919> any<00:05:45.130> further

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
that if I drove it any further

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:47.790 
that if I drove it any further
it<00:05:46.150> would<00:05:46.270> probably<00:05:46.479> blow<00:05:46.780> up<00:05:47.050> and<00:05:47.320> throw<00:05:47.770> a

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
it would probably blow up and throw a

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.800 
it would probably blow up and throw a
rod<00:05:48.070> right<00:05:48.310> through<00:05:48.580> the<00:05:48.669> block<00:05:48.849> and<00:05:49.300> I<00:05:49.510> really

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
rod right through the block and I really

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.400 
rod right through the block and I really
didn't<00:05:50.050> want<00:05:50.260> that<00:05:50.970> I<00:05:51.970> think<00:05:52.840> that<00:05:53.020> the<00:05:53.169> motor

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.410 
didn't want that I think that the motor

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.400 
didn't want that I think that the motor
would<00:05:53.860> still<00:05:54.160> be<00:05:54.310> running<00:05:54.460> the<00:05:55.240> way<00:05:55.389> it<00:05:55.539> was<00:05:55.720> if

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:56.410 
would still be running the way it was if

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.820 
would still be running the way it was if
I<00:05:56.650> haven't<00:05:57.039> haven't<00:05:57.820> quit<00:05:58.210> Marvel<00:05:58.720> mr.<00:05:59.110> Lilly

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
I quit almost a whole bottle in and I I

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.620 
I quit almost a whole bottle in and I I
don't<00:06:02.770> think<00:06:02.949> I<00:06:03.039> should<00:06:03.099> have<00:06:03.250> done<00:06:03.370> that<00:06:03.630> but

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
don't think I should have done that but

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.450 
don't think I should have done that but
I<00:06:04.690> was<00:06:04.840> so<00:06:04.960> bent<00:06:05.169> on<00:06:05.380> making<00:06:05.590> that<00:06:05.830> rod<00:06:06.010> not<00:06:06.220> go

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460 
I was so bent on making that rod not go

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:12.360 
I was so bent on making that rod not go
away<00:06:06.699> I<00:06:06.970> think<00:06:07.720> that's<00:06:08.139> what<00:06:08.349> killed<00:06:08.500> it<00:06:11.370> my

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370

Chrysler forums on the internet and a

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:28.080 
Chrysler forums on the internet and a
few<00:06:25.780> people<00:06:26.169> have<00:06:26.500> suggested<00:06:27.190> that<00:06:27.789> I<00:06:27.849> take

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090 
few people have suggested that I take

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.170 
few people have suggested that I take
the<00:06:28.270> crank<00:06:28.539> out<00:06:28.750> and<00:06:29.490> replace<00:06:30.490> the<00:06:30.669> crank<00:06:30.909> and

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:31.180 
the crank out and replace the crank and

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.270 
the crank out and replace the crank and
replace<00:06:31.930> all<00:06:32.110> the<00:06:32.260> bearings<00:06:32.590> again<00:06:32.770> but<00:06:33.190> I'm

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 
replace all the bearings again but I'm

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.140 
replace all the bearings again but I'm
not<00:06:33.400> going<00:06:33.580> to<00:06:33.640> do<00:06:33.760> that

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:34.150 
not going to do that

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:35.280 
not going to do that
because<00:06:34.300> if<00:06:34.450> you<00:06:34.570> think<00:06:34.780> about<00:06:34.990> it<00:06:35.140> like<00:06:35.230> this

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:35.290

me and it was a lesson that on these
type<00:07:29.470> of<00:07:29.500> motors<00:07:29.980> do<00:07:30.250> not<00:07:30.460> try<00:07:30.700> to<00:07:30.730> save<00:07:31.060> him
