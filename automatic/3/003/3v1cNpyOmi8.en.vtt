00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:43.930 

where's<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:38.510> rhombus<00:00:41.239> where's<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.690> rhombus

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
where's the rhombus where's the rhombus

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:51.400 
where's the rhombus where's the rhombus
you<00:00:44.940> found<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.450> rhombus<00:00:46.079> survey<00:00:48.230> where's<00:00:49.230> the

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
you found the rhombus survey where's the

00:00:51.410 --> 00:01:00.340 
you found the rhombus survey where's the
trapezoid<00:00:54.350> is<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.770> trapezoid<00:00:56.399> okay<00:00:59.120> Anthony

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
trapezoid is the trapezoid okay Anthony

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:07.670 
trapezoid is the trapezoid okay Anthony
Anthony<00:01:01.350> where's<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.370> Oval<00:01:06.080> founded<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.560> you

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
Anthony where's the Oval founded and you

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.270 
Anthony where's the Oval founded and you
threw<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.010> but<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:08.939> found<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.360> oval<00:01:10.100> can<00:01:11.100> you

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
threw it but you found the oval can you

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:21.289 
threw it but you found the oval can you
find<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:12.830> UM<00:01:14.479> octagon<00:01:18.860> where's<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.040> up<00:01:20.299> is

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
find the UM octagon where's the up is

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:28.899 
find the UM octagon where's the up is
the<00:01:21.780> Octagon<00:01:22.439> good<00:01:23.159> job<00:01:24.229> can<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.290> put<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.530> back

can<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.000> put<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.299> trapezoid<00:01:30.840> back<00:01:31.049> where<00:01:31.259> it

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
can you put the trapezoid back where it

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.190 
can you put the trapezoid back where it
belongs<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:32.390> put<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.479> trapezoid<00:01:33.990> back

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
belongs to put the trapezoid back

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.280 
belongs to put the trapezoid back
where's<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.130> trapezoid<00:01:36.110> where's<00:01:37.110> the

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
where's the trapezoid where's the

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.050 
where's the trapezoid where's the

trapezoid yep put it back that's where

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:49.130 
trapezoid yep put it back that's where
it<00:01:42.150> goes<00:01:42.350> put<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.500> trapezoid<00:01:44.009> back<00:01:48.140> there's

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
it goes put the trapezoid back there's

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.940 
it goes put the trapezoid back there's
the<00:01:49.409> trapezoid<00:01:50.009> good<00:01:50.220> job<00:01:50.930> can<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:51.960> find<00:01:52.439> the

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
the trapezoid good job can you find the

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.230 
the trapezoid good job can you find the
Pentagon<00:01:54.920> that's<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.159> Octagon<00:01:56.759> that's<00:01:56.969> close

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
Pentagon that's the Octagon that's close

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.190 
Pentagon that's the Octagon that's close
where's<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.689> Pentagon<00:01:59.960> where<00:02:00.960> is<00:02:01.049> the

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
where's the Pentagon where is the

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.860 
where's the Pentagon where is the
Pentagon

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
Pentagon

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.610
