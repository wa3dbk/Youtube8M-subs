00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.410 

hi<00:00:10.599> I'm<00:00:10.900> using<00:00:11.170> pastel<00:00:11.710> matte<00:00:11.860> paper

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
hi I'm using pastel matte paper

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.329 
hi I'm using pastel matte paper
specifically<00:00:13.420> to<00:00:13.630> show<00:00:13.870> you<00:00:13.929> how<00:00:14.620> water

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:15.339 
specifically to show you how water

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:17.520 
specifically to show you how water
resistant<00:00:16.000> is<00:00:16.270> so<00:00:16.570> you<00:00:16.630> can<00:00:17.080> put<00:00:17.290> some

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:17.530 
resistant is so you can put some

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.860 
resistant is so you can put some
pastelon<00:00:18.100> and<00:00:18.370> then<00:00:21.120> instead<00:00:22.120> of<00:00:22.180> maybe<00:00:22.600> using

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:22.870 
pastelon and then instead of maybe using

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.310 
pastelon and then instead of maybe using
my<00:00:23.200> finger<00:00:23.830> to<00:00:24.090> blend<00:00:25.090> the<00:00:25.510> colors<00:00:25.840> I<00:00:26.020> can<00:00:26.080> do

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
my finger to blend the colors I can do

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.560 
my finger to blend the colors I can do
some<00:00:26.530> under<00:00:26.800> painting<00:00:27.310> using<00:00:28.030> a<00:00:28.360> brush

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
some under painting using a brush

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.060 
some under painting using a brush
blending<00:00:29.410> it<00:00:29.560> that<00:00:29.740> way

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.320 

so<00:00:33.070> I<00:00:33.100> put<00:00:33.460> the<00:00:33.700> nice<00:00:34.390> sort<00:00:34.660> of<00:00:34.780> purpley<00:00:36.330> gray

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:37.330 
so I put the nice sort of purpley gray

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.850 
so I put the nice sort of purpley gray
color<00:00:37.690> on<00:00:37.900> slightly<00:00:38.650> paler<00:00:39.070> color<00:00:40.830> put<00:00:41.830> a

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
color on slightly paler color put a

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:48.480 
color on slightly paler color put a
brown<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.950> some<00:00:45.160> other<00:00:45.310> colors<00:00:45.730> yellow<00:00:47.490> and

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:48.490 
brown and some other colors yellow and

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:55.979 
brown and some other colors yellow and
some<00:00:48.820> white<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:52.890> I'll<00:00:53.890> just<00:00:54.160> add<00:00:55.030> some<00:00:55.450> water

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
some white and I'll just add some water

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:05.790 
some white and I'll just add some water
to<00:00:56.350> that<00:00:57.780> with<00:00:58.780> my<00:00:58.960> brush<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:03.550> the<00:01:04.650> pasta<00:01:05.650> matte

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
to that with my brush so the pasta matte

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:13.350 
to that with my brush so the pasta matte
paper<00:01:06.180> doesn't<00:01:07.180> absorb<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:11.130> pastel<00:01:12.360> totally

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
paper doesn't absorb the pastel totally

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.390 
paper doesn't absorb the pastel totally
the<00:01:13.510> water<00:01:13.690> doesn't<00:01:13.990> just<00:01:14.350> soak<00:01:14.590> right<00:01:15.220> the

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
the water doesn't just soak right the

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.830 
the water doesn't just soak right the
way<00:01:15.520> through<00:01:15.790> it<00:01:15.850> so<00:01:16.000> you<00:01:16.090> can<00:01:16.240> move<00:01:16.390> past<00:01:16.600> all

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
way through it so you can move past all

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.070 
way through it so you can move past all
around<00:01:17.170> a<00:01:17.380> little<00:01:17.500> bit<00:01:17.799> you'll<00:01:18.430> see<00:01:18.520> that<00:01:19.080> when

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
around a little bit you'll see that when

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.230 
around a little bit you'll see that when
I<00:01:20.110> put<00:01:20.350> the<00:01:20.440> water<00:01:20.620> on<00:01:20.770> it<00:01:21.040> seems<00:01:21.400> to<00:01:21.610> darken<00:01:22.120> it

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
I put the water on it seems to darken it

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.030 
I put the water on it seems to darken it
and<00:01:23.909> but<00:01:24.909> it<00:01:25.000> will<00:01:25.180> dry<00:01:25.360> lighter<00:01:25.780> and<00:01:26.200> then

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
and but it will dry lighter and then

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.180 
and but it will dry lighter and then
when<00:01:27.370> that's<00:01:27.580> dried<00:01:27.909> I<00:01:28.270> can<00:01:28.720> put<00:01:28.930> some<00:01:29.229> more

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
when that's dried I can put some more

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.810 
when that's dried I can put some more
pastel<00:01:30.610> work<00:01:30.909> on<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:32.200> I'll<00:01:32.380> let<00:01:32.560> that<00:01:32.590> dry<00:01:33.100> and

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
pastel work on so I'll let that dry and

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.510 
pastel work on so I'll let that dry and
come<00:01:34.090> back<00:01:34.240> to<00:01:34.390> that<00:01:34.540> in<00:01:34.750> a<00:01:34.869> minute<00:01:35.340> now<00:01:36.340> it's

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
come back to that in a minute now it's

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.510 
come back to that in a minute now it's
dry<00:01:36.820> we<00:01:37.540> can<00:01:37.570> add<00:01:37.960> more<00:01:38.320> layers<00:01:38.619> of<00:01:38.710> pastel<00:01:39.340> and

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
dry we can add more layers of pastel and

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.230 
dry we can add more layers of pastel and
the<00:01:40.560> pastel<00:01:41.560> takes<00:01:41.830> very<00:01:42.130> easily<00:01:42.369> you<00:01:43.090> can

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
the pastel takes very easily you can

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.620 
the pastel takes very easily you can
also<00:01:43.420> see<00:01:43.810> how<00:01:44.049> the<00:01:44.110> surface<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:45.909> the<00:01:46.240> past<00:01:46.450> on

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
also see how the surface of the past on

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.030 
also see how the surface of the past on
that<00:01:46.750> paper<00:01:47.020> hasn't<00:01:47.820> buckled<00:01:48.820> or<00:01:49.000> cockles<00:01:50.040> so

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
that paper hasn't buckled or cockles so

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.210 
that paper hasn't buckled or cockles so
it<00:01:51.189> stayed<00:01:51.490> nice<00:01:51.729> and<00:01:52.060> flat<00:01:52.360> for<00:01:52.979> what<00:01:53.979> I<00:01:54.010> want

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
it stayed nice and flat for what I want

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.850 
it stayed nice and flat for what I want
to<00:01:54.430> do<00:01:54.750> so<00:01:55.750> we'll<00:01:55.900> just<00:01:56.049> put<00:01:56.229> a<00:01:56.290> bit<00:01:56.470> of<00:01:56.560> shading

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
to do so we'll just put a bit of shading

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:03.590 
to do so we'll just put a bit of shading
on<00:01:57.520> this

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.320 

blending<00:02:04.470> with<00:02:04.680> you<00:02:04.860> finger<00:02:05.400> if<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.850> want<00:02:06.090> or

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
blending with you finger if you want or

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.969 
blending with you finger if you want or
with<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.570> pastel<00:02:06.960> shape<00:02:07.229> or<00:02:07.440> even<00:02:07.560> with<00:02:07.950> a

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
with the pastel shape or even with a

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.310 
with the pastel shape or even with a
brush<00:02:08.280> but<00:02:09.119> bear<00:02:09.330> in<00:02:09.479> mind<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.899> more<00:02:10.050> layers

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
brush but bear in mind the more layers

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.570 
brush but bear in mind the more layers
of<00:02:10.560> pastel<00:02:11.070> you<00:02:11.580> put<00:02:11.850> on<00:02:12.590> if<00:02:13.590> you're<00:02:13.980> using<00:02:14.340> a

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
of pastel you put on if you're using a

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.900 
of pastel you put on if you're using a
brush<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:15.870> more<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.290> layers<00:02:16.980> of<00:02:17.280> pastel<00:02:17.730> will

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
brush the more the layers of pastel will

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.040 
brush the more the layers of pastel will
be<00:02:18.090> disturbed

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
be disturbed

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.140 
be disturbed
but<00:02:19.290> it's<00:02:19.410> quite<00:02:19.620> nice<00:02:19.800> to<00:02:19.860> use<00:02:20.220> as<00:02:20.459> a<00:02:20.490> method

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
but it's quite nice to use as a method

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.570 
but it's quite nice to use as a method
of<00:02:21.270> under<00:02:21.959> painting<00:02:22.170> prior<00:02:23.040> to<00:02:23.370> adding<00:02:24.150> more

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
of under painting prior to adding more

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.240 
of under painting prior to adding more
layers<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:27.000> then<00:02:27.570> just<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:27.930> little<00:02:28.200> bit<00:02:28.320> of<00:02:28.440> bit

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
layers and then just a little bit of bit

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:37.520 
layers and then just a little bit of bit
more<00:02:29.459> shading<00:02:34.730> so<00:02:35.730> there<00:02:35.940> we've<00:02:36.150> got<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.540> very

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
more shading so there we've got the very

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.199 
more shading so there we've got the very
simple<00:02:38.390> study<00:02:39.390> of<00:02:39.630> an<00:02:39.780> apple<00:02:40.220> using<00:02:41.220> under

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
simple study of an apple using under

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.590 
simple study of an apple using under
painting<00:02:42.720> for<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.470> background<00:02:44.100> so<00:02:44.910> why<00:02:45.450> not

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
painting for the background so why not

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.620 
painting for the background so why not
try<00:02:45.900> about<00:02:45.959> yourself
