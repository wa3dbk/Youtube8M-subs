00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.850
 third episode of the series yards 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.710
 but naval except today is not 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.920
 not anyone any day 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.100
 forgiveness Friday June 6, 2014 it's the 70 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.680
 years 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.150
 obviously the dj and the landing in 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.009
 Normandy during the Second World War 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.869
 World 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:33.180
 and to mark this event I have you 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.250
 concocted a little liberty ship so a 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.150
 boat that was used for the 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.579
 landing a boat in military motorcycle 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:45.030
 which was actually the most 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.559
 used during there during the assault in 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.539
 done during the landing 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.350
 so I'll introduce myself right now 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.350
 here we go 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.920
 and so immediately now under 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:04.799
 your eyes amazed a liberty ship indret 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.200
 this time the john of balbronn so a 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.830
 the last two of the berthet chip that 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.630
 stays still afloat today so is 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.130
 this one is mine so here it is 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:19.920
 some views that will follow 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:23.580
 the hull is made of gray wool 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.679
 the clear deck and the amenities in 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.270
 does most of the jean superstructures 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:29.670
 Lesbats and cannon things like that 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.590
 are made in question which is rather 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.929
 rather dark gray in the end and it's 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.909
 true that I found that there the gray key 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:36.690
 dark actually made it too dark 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.460
 suddenly 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.319
 so I preferred the cyan key and 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:46.440
 it's true that many do not like 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:48.360
 but less for his 60th here so the 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.970
 inks done with a few small 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.450
 stairs of this volume bricks up and 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.970
 narrow down the lifeboats 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.300
 with their little dive while their 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.920
 task in wooden fence and the rest of the 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.310
 lifeboat and is in wool 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.550
 with slabs of stone lice for the 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.979
 sitting in Canada Day here two 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.760
 small air vents does like 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.489
 said previously 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:18.959
 in clear without forgiveness and in items frame 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.840
 here a small entrance of hangars in 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:24.269
 class there always with carpets of 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.440
 gray wool carpet from above and 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.420
 small buttons and small scales 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.110
 to do a little more detail on 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.030
 two on the bazaar the bridge before here with 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.489

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.860
 with the footer myth and 1 and a 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.269
 crane cloth on it is the second that 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.230
 you see a little bit behind 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:45.120
 with always 2 arms 2 street on you 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.280
 can see here the fireplace still in 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.590
 Class is actually a and with her his 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.019
 little tongue in 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.000
 in black wool from above and therefore 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:56.060
 the smoke is still in canvas 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.310
 of spider because I find that the 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.930
 last marc identical to the second one actually 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.610
 with always two little citrus fruits and 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.849
 a sheet of cranes behind still in 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:08.420
 supplement the lilies here made in clear 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:10.760
 yellow and also the patelin the party 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.489
 submerged the hull actually made 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.310
 in clear where I see there some seen of 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.590
 cannons which are so for the most part 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.959
 for the larger ones especially embellished with 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.690
 some feet details so here a cannon 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:26.660
 to those big with nice sto every 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.720
 cannons are jumping stone lice ago 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.459
 small details see in iron bar 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.299
 with brick sto buttons in 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.299
 below things like that 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.400
 Oh 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.459
 little you from the stern so the back of the 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:52.709
 boat with the big wake the cannon and 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.420
 the sample in American flag yes yes 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.519
 this little dung that is this 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.569
 float the bank threefold behind 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:02.310
 is an American flag 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:03.810
 but big a little view before the 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.569
 gateway actually with a big 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.280
 windows can see it on the front the 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.069
 wheelhouse makes it the small cube that is 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.919
 in the center is the wheelhouse which 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:16.470
 some cannons and the sight chimney 

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:18.769
 here from the AriÃ¨ge beyond the bridge 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.269
 so with a few ladders the barriers 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:24.060
 we still distinguish a few mouths 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:28.080
 venting a hold entry of things 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.849
