perfectly<00:02:02.640> any<00:02:03.149> deserve<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:03.869> goal<00:02:04.049> a

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
perfectly any deserve that goal a

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.649 
perfectly any deserve that goal a
hundred<00:02:04.619> percent<00:02:05.450> another<00:02:06.450> thing<00:02:06.630> that

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
hundred percent another thing that

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.719 
hundred percent another thing that
they've<00:02:06.899> changed<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.560> I've<00:02:08.129> noticed<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.550> huge

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
they've changed and I've noticed a huge

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.180 
they've changed and I've noticed a huge
difference<00:02:08.819> is<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.360> pace<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:10.679> does<00:02:10.950> make<00:02:11.129> a

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
difference is that pace it does make a

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.590 
difference is that pace it does make a
pretty<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:12.180> does<00:02:12.599> make<00:02:12.810> a<00:02:12.870> pretty<00:02:13.260> sick

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600

92<00:03:14.440> pace<00:03:14.830> just<00:03:15.520> the<00:03:15.640> fact<00:03:15.910> that<00:03:16.000> he<00:03:16.090> has<00:03:16.270> such

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
92 pace just the fact that he has such

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.260 
92 pace just the fact that he has such
high<00:03:16.720> strength<00:03:17.170> is<00:03:17.380> that<00:03:17.950> chances<00:03:18.730> are<00:03:18.850> you're

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
high strength is that chances are you're

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:20.820 
high strength is that chances are you're
gonna<00:03:19.360> be<00:03:19.510> pushed<00:03:19.720> off<00:03:19.870> that<00:03:20.080> ball<00:03:20.290> and<00:03:20.470> before

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
gonna be pushed off that ball and before

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.800 
gonna be pushed off that ball and before
in<00:03:21.070> the<00:03:21.190> past<00:03:21.310> FIFA's<00:03:21.790> it<00:03:22.390> wouldn't<00:03:22.690> happen

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
in the past FIFA's it wouldn't happen

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.270 
in the past FIFA's it wouldn't happen
like<00:03:23.080> that<00:03:23.110> you<00:03:23.380> just<00:03:23.410> sprint<00:03:23.890> right<00:03:24.040> around

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
like that you just sprint right around

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.130 
like that you just sprint right around
them<00:03:24.460> but<00:03:24.580> now<00:03:24.790> it's<00:03:25.000> changed<00:03:25.510> the<00:03:25.630> defenders

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
them but now it's changed the defenders

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.740 
them but now it's changed the defenders
are<00:03:26.350> a<00:03:26.380> lot<00:03:27.160> more<00:03:27.190> bigger<00:03:27.610> they're<00:03:28.390> more

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
are a lot more bigger they're more

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.720 
are a lot more bigger they're more
powerful<00:03:29.320> and<00:03:29.590> I<00:03:30.130> think<00:03:30.370> it's<00:03:30.490> made<00:03:30.640> a<00:03:30.670> huge

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
powerful and I think it's made a huge

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.790 
powerful and I think it's made a huge
difference<00:03:31.120> on<00:03:31.450> the<00:03:31.570> game<00:03:31.870> although

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
difference on the game although

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.640 
difference on the game although
sometimes<00:03:33.040> you<00:03:33.940> will<00:03:34.180> see<00:03:34.210> more<00:03:34.720> headers<00:03:35.440> that

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
sometimes you will see more headers that

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.740 
sometimes you will see more headers that
is<00:03:35.950> um<00:03:36.250> that's<00:03:36.880> another<00:03:37.150> thing<00:03:37.360> that's<00:03:37.570> been

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
is um that's another thing that's been

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.750 
is um that's another thing that's been
increased<00:03:38.260> I<00:03:38.410> find<00:03:38.650> like<00:03:38.920> with<00:03:39.130> a<00:03:39.160> difficulty

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
increased I find like with a difficulty

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.420 
increased I find like with a difficulty
to<00:03:40.360> score<00:03:40.780> off<00:03:41.440> of<00:03:41.770> skill<00:03:41.980> moves<00:03:42.190> and<00:03:42.370> stuff

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
to score off of skill moves and stuff

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.580 
to score off of skill moves and stuff
like<00:03:42.640> that<00:03:42.700> headers<00:03:43.630> and<00:03:43.810> crosses<00:03:44.260> have<00:03:44.410> been

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
like that headers and crosses have been

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.730 
like that headers and crosses have been
more<00:03:45.100> prominent<00:03:45.880> and<00:03:46.060> 414<00:03:46.840> that<00:03:47.200> have<00:03:47.320> seen<00:03:47.500> so

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
more prominent and 414 that have seen so

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.780 
more prominent and 414 that have seen so
far<00:03:47.920> but<00:03:48.730> um<00:03:49.080> nevertheless<00:03:50.080> it<00:03:50.620> is<00:03:50.860> so<00:03:51.520> far

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
far but um nevertheless it is so far

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.140 
far but um nevertheless it is so far
I've<00:03:52.000> been<00:03:52.030> having<00:03:52.330> a<00:03:52.420> blast<00:03:52.570> and<00:03:53.430> yeah<00:03:54.430> I<00:03:54.730> just
