00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
all that emajor but towards the end he

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.550 
all that emajor but towards the end he
moves<00:04:23.490> into<00:04:23.700> the<00:04:24.030> a<00:04:24.300> minor<00:04:24.720> pentatonic<00:04:25.140> which

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
moves into the a minor pentatonic which

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.260 
moves into the a minor pentatonic which
would<00:04:25.770> be<00:04:25.950> this<00:04:27.290> on<00:04:28.290> the<00:04:28.800> twelfth<00:04:29.130> fret<00:04:29.280> and<00:04:29.610> so

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
would be this on the twelfth fret and so

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:42.260 
would be this on the twelfth fret and so
against<00:04:39.770> that<00:04:40.770> kind<00:04:41.010> of<00:04:41.070> stuff<00:04:41.310> and<00:04:41.730> not<00:04:42.090> a<00:04:42.120> lot

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
against that kind of stuff and not a lot

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.600 
against that kind of stuff and not a lot
of<00:04:42.300> movement<00:04:42.710> you<00:04:43.710> know<00:04:43.800> basically<00:04:44.130> only

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
of movement you know basically only

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:50.390 
of movement you know basically only
using<00:04:44.880> those<00:04:45.000> notes<00:04:45.300> that<00:04:48.890> kind<00:04:49.890> of<00:04:49.980> thing<00:04:50.160> so

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
using those notes that kind of thing so

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.950 
using those notes that kind of thing so
I<00:04:50.430> think<00:04:50.610> if<00:04:50.910> you<00:04:51.000> fool<00:04:51.450> around<00:04:51.540> with<00:04:51.750> that<00:04:51.810> a

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
I think if you fool around with that a

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.570 
I think if you fool around with that a
little<00:04:52.050> bit<00:04:52.260> you'll<00:04:52.410> pick<00:04:52.590> it<00:04:52.620> up<00:04:52.800> and<00:04:53.040> then

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
little bit you'll pick it up and then

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.310 
little bit you'll pick it up and then
the<00:04:53.670> song<00:04:53.910> ends<00:04:54.360> with<00:04:54.510> just<00:04:54.630> an<00:04:54.780> E<00:04:54.960> chord<00:04:57.320> and

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
the song ends with just an E chord and

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.800 
the song ends with just an E chord and
more<00:04:58.650> quietly<00:04:59.100> it<00:04:59.340> plays<00:04:59.610> the<00:04:59.640> a

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
more quietly it plays the a

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:08.910 
more quietly it plays the a
and<00:05:02.590> the<00:05:03.040> D<00:05:03.280> suspend<00:05:03.880> -<00:05:07.470> and<00:05:08.470> he<00:05:08.590> just<00:05:08.620> lets

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:08.920 
and the D suspend - and he just lets

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.680 
and the D suspend - and he just lets
that<00:05:09.040> ring<00:05:09.250> that's<00:05:09.520> that's<00:05:10.240> how<00:05:10.330> it<00:05:10.450> ends<00:05:10.630> at

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
that ring that's that's how it ends at

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.280 
that ring that's that's how it ends at
least<00:05:10.870> on<00:05:10.960> the<00:05:11.020> studio<00:05:11.290> burger<00:05:12.660> so<00:05:13.660> it's<00:05:13.900> a<00:05:13.990> you

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.290 
least on the studio burger so it's a you

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.560 
least on the studio burger so it's a you
know<00:05:14.370> it's<00:05:15.370> a<00:05:15.490> pretty<00:05:15.639> hard<00:05:16.030> drive<00:05:16.270> and<00:05:16.419> rock
