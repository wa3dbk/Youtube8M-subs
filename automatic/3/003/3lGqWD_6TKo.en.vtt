00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:06.720
 Well, it's not good 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.079
 a final 

00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:09.709
 very beautiful akon 

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:11.259
 the expected with 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:14.039
 With much desire, there is a lot of desire to 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:17.050
 to finish a season that had been 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.980
 very very special 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.369
 yeah well I remember it was a very good match 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.109
 very intense where it gives at the beginning because the Manchester came out very strong but 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.949
 prada and ticino is the first goal because we could control the game 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.660
 it does not end different parties but this one is still ahead we have a 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.820
 great team with very good players that he likes to play 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.530
 one of the points 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.590
 That's why from the end of a beautiful ending I hope ii and we can do the same again 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.590
 things well and and get a victory 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.580
 more difficult to stay with one 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.879
 because they have very good players 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.100
 the rum and nani 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.960
 his defense are very good 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.270
 but poor's 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.480
 by history for all they have achieved by two pairs of hazelnut or 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.210
 can 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.860
 which 2 percent 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.770
 and dom future dinis that are 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.770
 two reference play 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.210
 they do not give me anything they have asked several times but 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.650
 efe the improvement in the headquarters to feed us the place did not freeze and 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.240
 so then well 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.820
 images refused the federation 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.820
 what it meant as she designated I know but it is highly 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.660
 the moment he does not know how to do 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.640
 good as a season you can rate it as very good act at 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.320
 both collectively and personally, as I have been able to play 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.230
 A lot of matches 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.710
 I can not help the renewables team 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.280
 how difficult it is difficult to stay coanil with a moment because the government 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.659
 we have a great time we have had great matches, people return to 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:16.569
 have a good time too 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.449
 but good to choose me would be with 

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:21.719
 with the day that we were champions in 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:24.719
 in the countryside 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.799
 well I hope not but it really did not affect because good 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:34.870
 percent 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.159
 each one has defended our mother glass 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:41.989
 and the selection then it's other things other kind of facts 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.669
 they are another moment from which do not jump 

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:48.969
 penalty should destroy and I think that one thing because you have to park the iy 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:51.439
 pando tobe selection then 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:53.159
 we all have to go in a 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:57.069
 in the same direction not only to do for our good but for the 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:58.249
 Friday 

00:02:58.249 --> 00:03:00.569
 unveil same selection 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.529
 and as for sergio, I'm glad I'm glad that all that will not be left 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:08.169
 nothing and and I think that 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:13.140
 that with that, because the team goes out it benefits because having 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.140
 with a player like that can be fundamental 

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:23.899
 good as they call him or little boss not for him not for everything that I have processed by 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:26.939
 because of his personality because 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:29.809
 because they are I think they are an example of 

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:31.179
 read player 

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:34.369
 that can play in different positions and 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:37.879
 and rendered at a level 

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:43.079
 villa the scorer 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:47.669
 scorer but believes that that is the qualifier for him apart from 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:51.119
 everything that gives us everything that works 

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:54.119
 but mainly he is a scorer 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:00.890
 polyvalent I think because it's square that 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.799
 It is very complete n 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.909
 with the left leg with the right leg to play in 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:07.939
 in different positions 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:11.189
 intense and b that has also been like a major player 

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:17.590
 koenig and can be seen 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.900
 the short time the months that we take two I think that 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:22.779
 that way 

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:26.609
 that has been and will be a great reinforcement because it has a lot of quality 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:28.800
 it's very fast 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.800
 iy adapted very well 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:37.710
 well I enjoyed 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.559
 of player guard 

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:45.219
 because a lot of people like me because that has fixed him as a player 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.370
 and now I'm learning a lot like 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:57.029
 he has not seen it but it is full 

00:04:57.029 --> 00:05:01.139
 they told me in fact it can be we have exchanged messages 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:03.680
 and then not 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:09.020
 Well, to be happy about what may have moments like that, you have to keep playing 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.130
 football and that he continues to play as well as he did here and how 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.830
 I knew I'm glad I'm very happy
