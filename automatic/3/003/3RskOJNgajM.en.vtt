the mini-map and I'm not using a
suppressor<00:00:54.450> so<00:00:55.450> this<00:00:56.380> push<00:00:56.940> might<00:00:57.940> have<00:00:58.090> been

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:58.240 
suppressor so this push might have been

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.610 
suppressor so this push might have been
a<00:00:58.270> little<00:00:58.450> bit<00:00:58.660> better<00:00:58.810> if<00:00:59.140> I<00:00:59.380> would<00:00:59.530> have

a little bit better if I would have

a little bit better if I would have
pushed<00:00:59.800> on<00:01:00.040> through<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:01.120> using<00:01:01.330> the<00:01:01.510> mg<00:01:01.780> for

shoulder<00:01:46.659> is<00:01:47.259> that<00:01:47.530> same<00:01:47.740> path<00:01:48.009> and<00:01:48.340> I'm<00:01:48.459> very

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
shoulder is that same path and I'm very

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.910 
shoulder is that same path and I'm very
reliant<00:01:49.240> on<00:01:49.450> the<00:01:49.600> other<00:01:49.810> team<00:01:50.109> members<00:01:50.139> that's

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
reliant on the other team members that's

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.590 
reliant on the other team members that's
probably<00:01:51.159> my<00:01:51.280> biggest<00:01:51.459> pet<00:01:51.819> peeve<00:01:52.119> is<00:01:52.569> when

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
probably my biggest pet peeve is when

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.989 
probably my biggest pet peeve is when
support<00:01:53.200> players<00:01:53.350> don't<00:01:53.770> throw<00:01:54.039> ammo<00:01:54.340> if<00:01:54.850> you

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:54.999 
support players don't throw ammo if you

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:56.940 
support players don't throw ammo if you
get<00:01:55.179> put<00:01:55.420> up<00:01:55.539> in<00:01:55.689> a<00:01:55.749> spot<00:01:55.869> if<00:01:56.409> your<00:01:56.619> pillar<00:01:56.829> in

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
get put up in a spot if your pillar in

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.499 
get put up in a spot if your pillar in
your<00:01:57.039> spot<00:01:57.189> just<00:01:57.399> drop<00:01:57.670> a<00:01:57.700> bag<00:01:57.999> if<00:01:58.240> someone

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
your spot just drop a bag if someone

00:01:58.509 --> 00:01:59.639 
your spot just drop a bag if someone
needs<00:01:58.659> Amal<00:01:58.990> they're<00:01:59.109> going<00:01:59.229> to<00:01:59.289> come<00:01:59.439> get<00:01:59.590> it

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
needs Amal they're going to come get it

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.059 
needs Amal they're going to come get it
now<00:01:59.920> I'm<00:02:00.429> going<00:02:00.609> to<00:02:00.670> turn<00:02:00.759> off<00:02:00.939> my<00:02:01.679> laser<00:02:02.679> here

00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:03.069 
now I'm going to turn off my laser here

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:05.580 
now I'm going to turn off my laser here
because<00:02:03.670> I'm<00:02:03.819> shooting<00:02:04.240> into<00:02:04.389> their<00:02:05.079> smoke

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
because I'm shooting into their smoke

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:06.929 
because I'm shooting into their smoke
monster<00:02:06.039> and<00:02:06.130> the<00:02:06.189> last<00:02:06.399> thing<00:02:06.520> I<00:02:06.609> want<00:02:06.729> to<00:02:06.759> do

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939 
monster and the last thing I want to do

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:09.300 
monster and the last thing I want to do
is<00:02:07.149> show<00:02:07.659> that<00:02:07.869> glistening<00:02:08.590> little<00:02:08.920> red<00:02:09.099> dot

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
is show that glistening little red dot

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.339 
is show that glistening little red dot
so<00:02:09.519> they<00:02:09.640> can<00:02:09.759> easily<00:02:10.060> shoot<00:02:10.239> me<00:02:10.450> in<00:02:10.629> my<00:02:10.959> face

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
so they can easily shoot me in my face

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:12.479 
so they can easily shoot me in my face
and<00:02:11.650> obviously<00:02:11.980> you<00:02:12.040> can<00:02:12.159> see<00:02:12.310> by<00:02:12.430> the

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
and obviously you can see by the

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:13.300 
and obviously you can see by the
mini-map

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
on the mini-map kind of memorizing what

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.710 
on the mini-map kind of memorizing what
that<00:02:21.890> placement<00:02:22.340> look<00:02:22.760> like<00:02:22.970> with<00:02:23.450> some<00:02:23.480> of

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
that placement look like with some of

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.970 
that placement look like with some of
those<00:02:23.840> rocks<00:02:24.080> in<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:24.349> facade<00:02:24.709> they're

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
those rocks in the facade they're

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.130 
those rocks in the facade they're
thinking<00:02:25.459> about<00:02:25.730> my<00:02:26.300> angles<00:02:26.660> that<00:02:26.720> I<00:02:26.780> have<00:02:27.020> to

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
thinking about my angles that I have to

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.140 
thinking about my angles that I have to
worry<00:02:27.380> about<00:02:27.530> obviously<00:02:28.400> there's<00:02:28.580> about<00:02:28.819> what

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
worry about obviously there's about what

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.449 
worry about obviously there's about what
a<00:02:29.180> 35<00:02:29.660> 40<00:02:29.989> degree<00:02:30.290> angle<00:02:30.319> there<00:02:30.709> then<00:02:31.250> I<00:02:31.340> can

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
a 35 40 degree angle there then I can

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.300 
a 35 40 degree angle there then I can
just<00:02:31.489> spam<00:02:31.959> watching<00:02:32.959> for<00:02:33.500> hit<00:02:33.620> markers<00:02:34.069> and

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
just spam watching for hit markers and

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.610 
just spam watching for hit markers and
throwing<00:02:34.819> down<00:02:35.000> those<00:02:35.420> supply<00:02:35.989> crates<00:02:36.380> and

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
throwing down those supply crates and

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.190 
throwing down those supply crates and
getting<00:02:36.860> mad<00:02:37.459> points<00:02:37.880> you<00:02:38.750> know<00:02:38.840> it's<00:02:39.080> like<00:02:39.140> a

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
getting mad points you know it's like a

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.070 
getting mad points you know it's like a
supply<00:02:39.709> crate<00:02:40.099> killstreak<00:02:40.970> point<00:02:41.360> Taj<00:02:41.660> I

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
supply crate killstreak point Taj I

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.600 
supply crate killstreak point Taj I
think<00:02:42.709> it<00:02:42.800> really<00:02:42.980> could<00:02:43.130> just<00:02:43.459> make<00:02:43.580> a

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
think it really could just make a

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.360 
think it really could just make a
montage<00:02:43.880> throwing<00:02:44.599> down<00:02:44.780> crates<00:02:45.739> for<00:02:46.010> people

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
montage throwing down crates for people

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.580 
montage throwing down crates for people
I<00:02:46.580> mean<00:02:47.000> clearly<00:02:47.120> you<00:02:47.480> can<00:02:47.720> get<00:02:47.989> thousands<00:02:48.530> of

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
I mean clearly you can get thousands of

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:49.840 
I mean clearly you can get thousands of
points<00:02:48.769> just<00:02:49.040> throwing<00:02:49.250> in<00:02:49.340> there<00:02:49.459> so<00:02:49.610> I'm<00:02:49.730> not

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
points just throwing in there so I'm not

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.789 
points just throwing in there so I'm not
going<00:02:49.970> to<00:02:50.030> peek<00:02:50.209> care<00:02:50.390> there's<00:02:51.110> massive

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
going to peek care there's massive

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.240 
going to peek care there's massive
massive<00:02:52.010> nades<00:02:52.400> check<00:02:53.090> up<00:02:53.239> the<00:02:53.330> c4<00:02:53.720> and<00:02:54.250> now

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
massive nades check up the c4 and now

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.830 
massive nades check up the c4 and now
I'm<00:02:55.370> going<00:02:55.489> to<00:02:55.549> peek<00:02:55.700> because<00:02:56.510> you<00:02:56.600> watch

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
I'm going to peek because you watch

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.020 
I'm going to peek because you watch
where<00:02:57.110> these<00:02:57.739> are<00:02:57.980> and<00:02:58.310> sometimes<00:02:58.489> you<00:02:58.790> see

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
where these are and sometimes you see

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.330 
where these are and sometimes you see
how<00:02:59.239> quickly<00:02:59.480> the<00:02:59.720> detonate<00:03:00.110> or<00:03:00.290> how<00:03:01.069> long<00:03:01.280> it

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
how quickly the detonate or how long it

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.220 
how quickly the detonate or how long it
till<00:03:01.580> they<00:03:01.670> definitely<00:03:02.120> if<00:03:02.299> those<00:03:02.900> it's<00:03:03.110> not

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
till they definitely if those it's not

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.020 
till they definitely if those it's not
an<00:03:03.319> impact<00:03:03.680> and<00:03:03.860> that<00:03:03.980> gives<00:03:04.160> you<00:03:04.370> the<00:03:04.640> ability

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
an impact and that gives you the ability

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.490 
an impact and that gives you the ability
to<00:03:05.330> say<00:03:05.510> oh<00:03:05.540> hey<00:03:05.870> that<00:03:05.900> guys<00:03:06.230> were<00:03:06.410> really

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
to say oh hey that guys were really

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.770 
to say oh hey that guys were really
close<00:03:06.650> or<00:03:07.430> if<00:03:07.730> it<00:03:07.819> detonates<00:03:07.970> right<00:03:08.480> in<00:03:08.569> front

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
close or if it detonates right in front

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.539 
close or if it detonates right in front
of<00:03:08.870> you<00:03:08.959> all<00:03:09.230> right<00:03:09.500> behind<00:03:09.799> you<00:03:10.040> he's<00:03:10.400> pretty

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
of you all right behind you he's pretty

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:12.640 
of you all right behind you he's pretty
far<00:03:10.880> away<00:03:11.030> and<00:03:11.390> that<00:03:11.510> was<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:11.840> depth<00:03:12.200> of<00:03:12.440> the

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
far away and that was the depth of the

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.100 
far away and that was the depth of the
detonation<00:03:13.280> so<00:03:13.880> the<00:03:14.120> smoke<00:03:14.360> monster<00:03:14.540> is<00:03:14.900> gone

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
detonation so the smoke monster is gone

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.490 
detonation so the smoke monster is gone
and<00:03:15.470> now<00:03:15.860> it's<00:03:16.160> the<00:03:16.430> incineration<00:03:17.500> monster

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
and now it's the incineration monster

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.280 
and now it's the incineration monster
getting<00:03:18.890> an<00:03:19.010> either<00:03:19.190> nice<00:03:19.670> streak<00:03:20.120> thanks<00:03:20.540> to

getting an either nice streak thanks to
the<00:03:21.410> supply<00:03:21.769> crate<00:03:22.100> so<00:03:22.310> this<00:03:22.489> allows<00:03:22.640> us<00:03:22.850> to<00:03:23.090> go

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
the supply crate so this allows us to go

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.000 
the supply crate so this allows us to go
for<00:03:23.870> the<00:03:23.900> reach<00:03:24.079> around<00:03:24.230> obviously<00:03:24.470> they<00:03:24.829> got

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
for the reach around obviously they got

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.069 
for the reach around obviously they got
B<00:03:25.220> and<00:03:25.459> shit<00:03:26.180> is<00:03:26.269> starting<00:03:26.450> to<00:03:26.630> hit<00:03:26.750> in<00:03:26.810> the<00:03:26.870> fan

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
B and shit is starting to hit in the fan

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.800 
B and shit is starting to hit in the fan
in<00:03:27.290> the<00:03:27.470> main<00:03:27.650> part<00:03:27.950> so<00:03:28.790> try<00:03:29.150> to<00:03:29.180> push<00:03:29.480> again

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
in the main part so try to push again

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.870 
in the main part so try to push again
take<00:03:30.590> it<00:03:30.709> nice<00:03:30.829> and<00:03:30.890> slow<00:03:31.100> this<00:03:31.430> time<00:03:31.640> because

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
take it nice and slow this time because

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.319 
take it nice and slow this time because
I'm<00:03:32.180> kind<00:03:33.079> of<00:03:33.200> by<00:03:33.319> myself<00:03:33.350> and<00:03:34.190> don't<00:03:34.910> want<00:03:35.239> to

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
I'm kind of by myself and don't want to

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.000 
I'm kind of by myself and don't want to
get<00:03:35.420> shot<00:03:35.450> from<00:03:35.989> the<00:03:36.230> other<00:03:36.350> flank<00:03:36.680> because

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
get shot from the other flank because

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.920 
get shot from the other flank because
they<00:03:37.160> can<00:03:37.310> they<00:03:37.760> can<00:03:37.790> saturate<00:03:38.090> this<00:03:38.600> entire

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
they can they can saturate this entire

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.530 
they can they can saturate this entire
area<00:03:39.290> so<00:03:39.560> you<00:03:39.590> really<00:03:40.010> got<00:03:40.160> to<00:03:40.250> be<00:03:40.340> careful<00:03:40.540> so

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
area so you really got to be careful so

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.199 
area so you really got to be careful so
I'm<00:03:41.810> going<00:03:41.989> to<00:03:42.019> check<00:03:42.290> get<00:03:43.100> ahead<00:03:43.310> and<00:03:43.579> this<00:03:44.090> is

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
I'm going to check get ahead and this is

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:45.729 
I'm going to check get ahead and this is
a<00:03:44.239> shot<00:03:44.569> that<00:03:44.780> I<00:03:44.810> kind<00:03:45.049> of<00:03:45.200> regret<00:03:45.319> taking

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
a shot that I kind of regret taking

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.129 
a shot that I kind of regret taking
these<00:03:46.130> two<00:03:46.370> right<00:03:46.579> here<00:03:46.609> I<00:03:47.120> probably<00:03:47.840> should

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:48.139 
these two right here I probably should

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:50.379 
these two right here I probably should
have<00:03:48.200> gotten<00:03:48.380> a<00:03:48.530> little<00:03:48.560> bit<00:03:48.889> closer<00:03:49.359> before<00:03:50.359> I

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:50.389 
have gotten a little bit closer before I

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:51.610 
have gotten a little bit closer before I
did<00:03:50.630> this<00:03:50.750> because<00:03:50.930> now<00:03:51.230> there's<00:03:51.470> guys

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
did this because now there's guys

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.020 
did this because now there's guys
screwing<00:03:51.980> around<00:03:52.160> behind<00:03:52.370> me<00:03:52.790> on<00:03:52.970> the

screwing around behind me on the

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.759 
screwing around behind me on the
mini-map<00:03:53.660> I'm<00:03:54.019> trying<00:03:54.170> to<00:03:54.260> use<00:03:54.410> this<00:03:54.530> rock

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
we might have a chance i don't know how

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.969 
we might have a chance i don't know how
that<00:04:17.299> guy<00:04:17.450> didn't<00:04:17.780> see<00:04:17.989> me<00:04:18.169> but<00:04:18.350> obviously

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
that guy didn't see me but obviously

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:21.940 
that guy didn't see me but obviously
that<00:04:19.220> little<00:04:19.519> streak<00:04:19.880> came<00:04:20.570> to<00:04:20.630> an<00:04:20.900> end<00:04:21.169> so

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
that little streak came to an end so

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.080 
that little streak came to an end so
when<00:04:22.070> it<00:04:22.159> starts<00:04:22.370> to<00:04:22.400> get<00:04:22.520> down<00:04:22.700> to<00:04:22.820> the<00:04:22.880> wire

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
when it starts to get down to the wire

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.210 
when it starts to get down to the wire
like<00:04:23.419> we<00:04:23.570> are<00:04:23.750> now<00:04:23.960> i<00:04:24.260> tend<00:04:24.590> to<00:04:24.650> look<00:04:24.800> at<00:04:24.979> the

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
like we are now i tend to look at the

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.990 
like we are now i tend to look at the
map<00:04:25.430> before<00:04:25.849> i<00:04:26.060> spawn<00:04:26.479> in

map before i spawn in
where<00:04:27.120> I<00:04:27.150> picked<00:04:27.420> the<00:04:27.510> same<00:04:27.750> route<00:04:27.990> I<00:04:28.170> might

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
where I picked the same route I might

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.680 
where I picked the same route I might
say<00:04:28.530> okay<00:04:28.800> how<00:04:28.980> is<00:04:29.010> the<00:04:29.220> far<00:04:29.550> right<00:04:29.850> look<00:04:30.180> all

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
say okay how is the far right look all

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.300 
say okay how is the far right look all
right<00:04:30.780> we<00:04:30.930> got<00:04:31.050> plenty<00:04:31.290> of<00:04:31.470> guys<00:04:31.590> there<00:04:31.950> how's

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
right we got plenty of guys there how's

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.520 
right we got plenty of guys there how's
the<00:04:32.580> mid<00:04:32.790> look<00:04:33.090> starting<00:04:33.510> to<00:04:33.600> collapse<00:04:33.870> or

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
the mid look starting to collapse or

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.070 
the mid look starting to collapse or
how's<00:04:34.800> the<00:04:35.100> lane<00:04:35.520> that<00:04:35.700> i<00:04:35.790> was<00:04:35.940> at<00:04:36.090> look<00:04:36.450> well

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
how's the lane that i was at look well

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.870 
how's the lane that i was at look well
it's<00:04:37.290> starting<00:04:37.650> to<00:04:37.830> collapse<00:04:38.130> so<00:04:38.430> maybe<00:04:38.760> i

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
it's starting to collapse so maybe i

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.150 
it's starting to collapse so maybe i
repost<00:04:39.450> that<00:04:39.630> Ling<00:04:39.810> it's<00:04:39.990> all<00:04:40.140> about<00:04:40.380> filling

lanes which is the absolute worse in
rush<00:04:52.080> gameplay<00:04:52.350> because<00:04:52.650> again<00:04:52.950> you're

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
rush gameplay because again you're

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.160 
rush gameplay because again you're
limited<00:04:53.670> to<00:04:53.850> what<00:04:54.240> parts<00:04:54.540> of<00:04:54.630> the<00:04:54.690> map<00:04:54.840> you<00:04:54.900> can

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.170 
limited to what parts of the map you can

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.680 
limited to what parts of the map you can
go<00:04:55.320> on<00:04:55.560> and<00:04:55.770> they're<00:04:56.190> pretty<00:04:56.700> narrow<00:04:56.760> for<00:04:57.570> the

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
go on and they're pretty narrow for the

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.720 
go on and they're pretty narrow for the
most<00:04:57.900> part<00:04:58.140> so<00:04:58.380> if<00:04:58.470> you<00:04:58.560> allow<00:04:58.740> them<00:04:58.920> to<00:04:59.190> blow

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730 
most part so if you allow them to blow

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.340 
most part so if you allow them to blow
up<00:04:59.880> one<00:05:00.090> of<00:05:00.180> the<00:05:00.270> lanes<00:05:00.540> they're<00:05:01.020> just<00:05:01.050> going

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
up one of the lanes they're just going

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:02.900 
up one of the lanes they're just going
to<00:05:01.440> start<00:05:01.620> shooting<00:05:02.160> you<00:05:02.220> an<00:05:02.370> aside<00:05:02.669> and

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
to start shooting you an aside and

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.909 
to start shooting you an aside and
shooting<00:05:03.180> in<00:05:03.300> the<00:05:03.390> back<00:05:03.570> and<00:05:03.810> that's<00:05:03.960> never<00:05:04.560> a

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
shooting in the back and that's never a

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:07.100
