like I said before in the stationary
field<00:01:04.519> I<00:01:04.640> think<00:01:04.940> this<00:01:05.059> is<00:01:05.120> probably<00:01:05.479> the<00:01:05.720> most

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
field I think this is probably the most

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.280 
field I think this is probably the most
important<00:01:06.710> skill<00:01:07.010> to<00:01:07.280> master<00:01:08.030> if<00:01:08.810> you<00:01:09.049> can

one on one with the defenseman you want
to<00:01:52.939> be<00:01:53.030> able<00:01:53.090> to<00:01:53.270> extend<00:01:53.570> then<00:01:53.990> have<00:01:54.200> a<00:01:54.229> very

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
to be able to extend then have a very

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.700 
to be able to extend then have a very
quick<00:01:54.789> quick<00:01:55.789> stickhandling<00:01:56.530> explosion<00:01:57.530> and

quick quick stickhandling explosion and

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.020 
quick quick stickhandling explosion and
then<00:01:57.890> extend<00:01:58.130> again<00:01:58.490> and<00:01:58.700> what<00:01:58.820> will<00:01:59.000> happen

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
then extend again and what will happen

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.209 
then extend again and what will happen
is<00:01:59.479> you'll<00:01:59.659> normally<00:01:59.810> draw<00:02:00.380> that<00:02:00.590> defenseman

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
is you'll normally draw that defenseman

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:03.219 
is you'll normally draw that defenseman
in<00:02:01.310> once<00:02:01.549> he<00:02:01.670> sees<00:02:01.850> you<00:02:02.030> extend<00:02:02.450> he's<00:02:02.960> going<00:02:03.140> to

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
in once he sees you extend he's going to

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.859 
in once he sees you extend he's going to
come<00:02:03.409> up<00:02:03.499> towards<00:02:03.950> you<00:02:04.070> right<00:02:04.249> here<00:02:04.869> you're

come up towards you right here you're

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.569 
come up towards you right here you're
going<00:02:06.020> to<00:02:06.079> make<00:02:06.200> a<00:02:06.259> very<00:02:06.380> very<00:02:06.890> quick<00:02:07.280> move

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.579 
going to make a very very quick move

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:09.310 
going to make a very very quick move
right<00:02:08.030> there<00:02:08.300> and<00:02:08.600> then<00:02:09.020> you're<00:02:09.140> going<00:02:09.259> to

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
right there and then you're going to

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.110 
right there and then you're going to
extend<00:02:09.530> back<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:09.920> outside<00:02:10.429> now<00:02:10.640> normally<00:02:11.030> the

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
extend back the outside now normally the

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.759 
extend back the outside now normally the
defenseman<00:02:11.659> is<00:02:11.750> committed<00:02:12.230> at<00:02:12.319> that<00:02:12.470> point

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
defenseman is committed at that point

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.490 
defenseman is committed at that point
you<00:02:12.830> can<00:02:13.159> accelerate<00:02:13.550> past<00:02:13.940> so<00:02:14.870> to<00:02:14.930> have<00:02:15.260> the

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
you can accelerate past so to have the

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.809 
you can accelerate past so to have the
ability<00:02:15.950> to<00:02:15.980> process

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
ability to process

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.360 
ability to process
and<00:02:17.120> work<00:02:17.390> on<00:02:17.569> this<00:02:17.689> maneuver<00:02:18.200> um<00:02:18.560> it's<00:02:19.249> going

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
and work on this maneuver um it's going

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.369 
and work on this maneuver um it's going
to<00:02:19.640> make<00:02:19.760> you<00:02:19.969> a<00:02:20.030> better<00:02:20.719> player<00:02:20.959> especially

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
to make you a better player especially

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:28.809 
to make you a better player especially
in<00:02:21.709> one-on-one<00:02:21.889> situations<00:02:27.489> ok<00:02:28.489> that's<00:02:28.730> just

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
in one-on-one situations ok that's just

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.640 
in one-on-one situations ok that's just
called<00:02:29.120> extension<00:02:29.420> stick<00:02:29.900> handle<00:02:30.260> and<00:02:30.409> it's<00:02:30.560> a

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
called extension stick handle and it's a

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.259 
called extension stick handle and it's a
little<00:02:30.799> bit<00:02:31.010> of<00:02:31.099> a<00:02:31.159> nuance<00:02:31.549> because<00:02:31.879> you<00:02:32.120> might

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
little bit of a nuance because you might

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:33.280 
little bit of a nuance because you might
not<00:02:32.299> be<00:02:32.540> able<00:02:32.569> to<00:02:32.719> see<00:02:32.810> a<00:02:32.840> difference<00:02:33.170> but

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
not be able to see a difference but

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.220 
not be able to see a difference but
really<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:33.739> difference<00:02:34.030> between<00:02:35.030> this

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
really the difference between this

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.440 
really the difference between this
extension<00:02:36.230> and<00:02:36.530> stick<00:02:36.769> handle<00:02:37.129> and<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.670> last

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
extension and stick handle and the last

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.259 
extension and stick handle and the last
one<00:02:39.049> with<00:02:39.200> extension<00:02:39.709> click<00:02:39.889> hands<00:02:40.250> is<00:02:41.030> that

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
one with extension click hands is that

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.629 
one with extension click hands is that
when<00:02:41.930> I<00:02:41.959> extend<00:02:42.409> them<00:02:42.560> stick<00:02:42.859> handling<00:02:43.219> on<00:02:43.430> the

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:43.639 
when I extend them stick handling on the

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:46.659 
when I extend them stick handling on the
outside<00:02:44.090> foot<00:02:44.709> so<00:02:45.709> I'm<00:02:45.859> extending<00:02:46.219> them<00:02:46.459> stick

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:46.669 
outside foot so I'm extending them stick

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:48.129 
outside foot so I'm extending them stick
handling<00:02:46.969> there<00:02:47.180> I'm<00:02:47.450> extending<00:02:47.870> I'm

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:48.139 
handling there I'm extending I'm

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:51.039 
handling there I'm extending I'm
sticking<00:02:48.560> lean<00:02:48.739> in<00:02:48.919> and<00:02:49.540> what<00:02:50.540> that<00:02:50.750> is<00:02:50.780> is

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
sticking lean in and what that is is

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:53.080 
sticking lean in and what that is is
this<00:02:51.859> is<00:02:52.010> really<00:02:52.159> just<00:02:52.370> controlling<00:02:52.819> at<00:02:52.969> the

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
this is really just controlling at the

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.939 
this is really just controlling at the
end<00:02:53.209> of<00:02:53.299> an<00:02:53.389> extension<00:02:53.900> um<00:02:54.049> it's<00:02:54.650> just<00:02:54.739> a

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:54.949 
end of an extension um it's just a

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:56.979 
end of an extension um it's just a
different<00:02:55.159> maneuver<00:02:55.819> I<00:02:56.030> mean<00:02:56.449> different<00:02:56.810> fly

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
different maneuver I mean different fly

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.530 
different maneuver I mean different fly
