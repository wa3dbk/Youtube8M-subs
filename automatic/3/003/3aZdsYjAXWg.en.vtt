there<00:00:18.750> are<00:00:18.779> minions<00:00:19.200> but<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:20.099> do<00:00:20.220> not<00:00:20.460> have<00:00:20.670> any

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
there are minions but I do not have any

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.179 
there are minions but I do not have any
minions<00:00:21.150> because<00:00:21.630> both<00:00:21.900> pairs<00:00:22.529> are<00:00:22.710> upgrading

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
minions because both pairs are upgrading

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.950 
minions because both pairs are upgrading
I<00:00:23.340> didn't<00:00:23.820> want<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:23.970> upgrade<00:00:24.090> them<00:00:24.419> separately

just<00:00:25.169> because<00:00:25.380> that<00:00:25.470> would<00:00:25.590> take<00:00:25.710> too<00:00:25.859> long

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
just because that would take too long

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.240 
just because that would take too long
and<00:00:26.670> I'd<00:00:26.760> hate<00:00:27.029> waiting<00:00:27.420> like<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.720> try<00:00:28.439> go<00:00:29.010> yo

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
don't have good wheelie or go wife and

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.240 
don't have good wheelie or go wife and
you<00:04:40.350> aren't<00:04:40.560> very<00:04:40.650> good<00:04:40.740> at<00:04:40.860> those<00:04:41.010> strategies

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
you aren't very good at those strategies

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.100 
you aren't very good at those strategies
but<00:04:41.850> you<00:04:41.940> should<00:04:42.060> definitely<00:04:42.210> be<00:04:42.450> practicing

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
but you should definitely be practicing

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.900 
but you should definitely be practicing
those<00:04:43.230> strategies<00:04:43.530> on<00:04:43.770> town<00:04:43.980> lines<00:04:44.280> like<00:04:44.790> I

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
those strategies on town lines like I

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.080 
those strategies on town lines like I
did<00:04:45.180> it<00:04:45.270> then<00:04:45.389> you<00:04:45.840> can<00:04:45.990> eventually<00:04:46.230> get

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
did it then you can eventually get

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.190 
did it then you can eventually get
better<00:04:48.090> at<00:04:48.330> those<00:04:48.480> strategies<00:04:48.750> and<00:04:48.990> you<00:04:49.050> can

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
better at those strategies and you can

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.080 
better at those strategies and you can
take<00:04:49.320> on<00:04:49.470> Channel<00:04:49.770> Ten's<00:04:49.980> like<00:04:50.160> that<00:04:50.400> I'm<00:04:50.880> not

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
take on Channel Ten's like that I'm not

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.510 
take on Channel Ten's like that I'm not
here<00:04:51.240> to<00:04:51.330> tell<00:04:51.480> you<00:04:51.540> guys<00:04:51.660> that<00:04:51.720> this<00:04:52.520> strategy

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
here to tell you guys that this strategy

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.909 
here to tell you guys that this strategy
is<00:04:53.910> the<00:04:54.360> best<00:04:54.540> or<00:04:54.690> anything<00:04:55.020> but<00:04:55.620> it

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
is the best or anything but it

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:57.740 
is the best or anything but it
definitely<00:04:56.130> is<00:04:56.460> a<00:04:56.490> great<00:04:56.910> substitution<00:04:57.389> for

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
definitely is a great substitution for

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.120 
definitely is a great substitution for
go<00:04:57.900> wee-wee<00:04:58.200> or<00:04:58.260> go<00:04:58.410> wipe<00:04:58.560> if<00:04:58.680> you<00:04:58.770> don't<00:04:58.950> have

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
go wee-wee or go wipe if you don't have

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.920 
go wee-wee or go wipe if you don't have
them<00:04:59.370> for<00:04:59.850> whatever<00:05:00.000> reason<00:05:00.450> maybe<00:05:00.480> now's<00:05:00.900> a

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
them for whatever reason maybe now's a

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.270 
them for whatever reason maybe now's a
good<00:05:01.110> time<00:05:01.169> since<00:05:01.650> you<00:05:01.770> might<00:05:01.860> have<00:05:02.070> both<00:05:02.250> your

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
good time since you might have both your

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.970 
good time since you might have both your
