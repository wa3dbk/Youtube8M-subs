 kind of vacation kept for a while 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.960
 you let it build on ordinary 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.570
 in the coming time I'll just go again 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.359
 normal upload 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.939
 this episode we 're a little bit shorter 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:29.880
 kenny's because all the time we still go 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.279
 just aziza working on our test an i 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.719
 saw it here like this 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.710
 I communion that broad head the stone 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.350
 cut out yes with my god and said 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.590
 just support him the coral ball 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.850
 stone design huppekee rent this 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.820
 I can now leave all of those items 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.350
 sort the rest i would go all the way to 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.199
 go downstairs 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.899
 because i can't be quoted though 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:57.960
 the title towers and the die or other 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.879
 Sturgeon you are lena 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.760
 can also be sorted i still have 31 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.790
 hoppers and I still need glass 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.229
 is going to get sand for a while 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.180
 prices fall over you versus crack 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.830
 have lying down 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.210
 if it is good to know have readers 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.250
 I equally dope him that this, there 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.970
 later from other side I think of 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.170
 other side 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.170
 they are just going to look neat 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:28.970
 I do my page and now towards the 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.970
 test because yes thick like 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.170
 I really seem like he is still here 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.170
 a regret and 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.610
 I would regret being faithless already know what 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.820
 the the natural shuffle but I put it in 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.409
 at least not regret it 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.210
 if only for a crack call people 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.530
 nice apple I see how I'm going to sleep 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.720
 neither of that confidence nor of course 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.790
 and we are all so nice to have to amuse 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.250
 the song therefore does not want to die because 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.200
 our bunkers no longer finish in season 2 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.680
 did you actually provide that me 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.920
 in it creates it must also start my 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.929
 Bunker Magna make the entire bunker only 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.790
 without resources in between I may think so 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.959
 I see it as a system rebuild or no 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.580
 neither, by the way, and then there is 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.840
 of course bison is like well that is 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.440
 I would nevertheless ask you, I got it 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.730
 still in bread with me that's pretty bad 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.330
 because that could mean my death 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.280
 your rolator and don't feel like it 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:31.440
 we are now going for our early chance 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:33.180
 because they need good food and 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.170
 we are 18 pro while it comes with it all the time 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.000
 by 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.010
 and if not then I have no lottery tickets 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.300
 hungry no that's not possible 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.459
 one way we don't die is one 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.370
 there is hunger because there is no 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.780
 No I think that just can not 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:53.310
 starving to death 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:55.050
 I think that's so sad I go 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.730
 you see an i will go to sleep and on 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.319
 the zanten all and I mean go back 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.440
 about the rabbit block 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.090
 because I had bread or so then go 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.400
 there you still seem to get back and 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.870
 on the shanty life there must be other we 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.209
 we should not focus our are by yoga 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.970
 he only a few meters from hope 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.260
 that there is no strange cow already went 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.120
 years chicken or a brick 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.489
 of course because they can also simply 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.580
 survive 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.800
 it looks like we're pretty good 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:27.239
 will see no windows monsters 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:32.129
 not today we should not be 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:33.659
 present it is all still possible 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:36.319
 I grab it but in time it is correct 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:36.319
 black treatment 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:41.370
 because you have well you never know 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.610
 when a 9 and weird beast appears 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:49.140
 coming 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:50.700
 oh i hear a scary scary scary scary

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:10.670
 because I want to repair this again as 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:14.900
 someone is broken 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:17.660

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.330
 I make them all the sand because you agree 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.180

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.510

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.510

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.840
 chances of picking it up because there is 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.190
 there are already more views tags so I pretty much 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.270

 we have had enough of a very long time now 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:51.169

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.640
