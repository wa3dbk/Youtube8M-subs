00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:11.280
 remove favorite movie I love rockin ' 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:20.390
 exactly love the hands of the people of the whole world 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:20.390
 Okinawa loves so jail like 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:35.180
 hello everyone and you guessed it 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:38.960
 today we will be the first 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.960
 rev 2 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.590
 plots . 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.369
 so how is this reef played and played 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:09.490
 this reef is just 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:15.490
 just take a pick two times or 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:22.409
 nail on the open 5 string then 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:22.409
 we clamp the fifth string on the third fret 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:34.100
 and then we make a hit accordingly and 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:41.810
 then we hold on the fourth as you 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:47.050
 see simple and effective then 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.050
 do the same thing in 4 countries 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.020
 again on 5 string 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:22.740
 at 6 focus on bumps do the third 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:26.780
 the fourth blow, that is, that tour there is 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.780
 that such a technique is called jamming 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:49.760
 just take the edge of the palm and put it in 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:53.900
 the beginning of the strings took over the authorities 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.900
 it turns out to and muffled sound 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.740
 the next reef is as follows 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:46.860
 so how is this reef played 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:51.390
 we clamp on 5 string 2 fret and play 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:56.810
 here blows down by two or three 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.810
 top strings at that pace 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.680
 slow 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:25.870
 and now the finger is left here and the little finger 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:28.710
 clamps on the fifth on the 5th string 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.710
 four 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:08.010
 and now for beauty 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:11.600
 doing a band job is such a thing 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:13.990
 such as 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:17.190
 pull the string 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.190
 and pull her down 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:48.230
 transition here is such a fifth string on 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:52.910
 the second year 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:56.840
 4 p. Open 4 string on the first fret 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:06:01.360
 and we are doing the same pattern just now 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.360
 on 4 countries 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:20.389
 and now it turns out a volume of about 5 

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:20.389
 4 3 countries 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:33.860
 and here is such a transition 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:37.189
 i.e. 5 string clamped no fourth 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:40.270
 string clamped on the second fret 4 string 

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:40.270
 locked in the first year 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:55.100
 then the fourth string is open 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:58.540
 and again on string 5 and so next 

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.540
 sounds like that
