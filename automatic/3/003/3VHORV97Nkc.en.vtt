00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.900 
pay an income don't be so eager to leave
something<00:02:32.900> like<00:02:33.080> that<00:02:33.200> because<00:02:33.769> that's<00:02:34.489> the

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
something like that because that's the

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.120 
something like that because that's the
best<00:02:35.180> opportunity<00:02:35.540> you<00:02:36.050> have<00:02:36.230> to<00:02:36.920> go<00:02:37.069> to

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
best opportunity you have to go to

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.020 
best opportunity you have to go to
school<00:02:37.580> if<00:02:38.300> it's<00:02:38.959> in<00:02:39.080> the<00:02:39.170> area<00:02:39.500> obviously<00:02:40.069> and

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
school if it's in the area obviously and

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.699 
school if it's in the area obviously and
incur<00:02:41.360> the<00:02:41.540> least<00:02:41.720> amount<00:02:41.930> of<00:02:42.080> debt<00:02:42.260> because

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
incur the least amount of debt because

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.009 
incur the least amount of debt because
if<00:02:43.190> you<00:02:43.459> live<00:02:43.700> on<00:02:43.790> your<00:02:43.850> own<00:02:43.940> you'll<00:02:44.690> notice

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
if you live on your own you'll notice

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.930 
if you live on your own you'll notice
that<00:02:45.260> a<00:02:45.319> large<00:02:45.769> chunk<00:02:46.100> of<00:02:46.250> your<00:02:46.370> income<00:02:46.670> goes

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
that a large chunk of your income goes

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.699 
that a large chunk of your income goes
to<00:02:47.560> your<00:02:48.560> living<00:02:49.370> space<00:02:49.489> so<00:02:50.209> that<00:02:50.810> is<00:02:51.170> one<00:02:51.680> of

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
to your living space so that is one of

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.050 
to your living space so that is one of
my<00:02:51.920> biggest<00:02:52.160> tips<00:02:52.489> another<00:02:53.480> one<00:02:53.810> is<00:02:54.910> to<00:02:55.910> take

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
my biggest tips another one is to take

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.330 
my biggest tips another one is to take
less<00:02:56.360> classes<00:02:56.930> so<00:02:57.200> that<00:02:57.410> you<00:02:57.530> can<00:02:57.799> go<00:02:58.069> to<00:02:58.130> work

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
less classes so that you can go to work

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.520 
less classes so that you can go to work
more<00:02:58.610> you<00:02:58.880> won't<00:02:59.750> graduate<00:02:59.900> as<00:03:00.319> quickly

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
more you won't graduate as quickly

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.860 
more you won't graduate as quickly
obviously<00:03:01.220> but<00:03:01.579> I<00:03:01.820> don't<00:03:02.060> think<00:03:02.299> it's<00:03:02.450> a<00:03:02.600> race

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
obviously but I don't think it's a race

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.560 
obviously but I don't think it's a race
unless<00:03:03.709> you're<00:03:04.160> unless<00:03:04.519> you<00:03:04.970> have<00:03:05.209> to<00:03:05.450> be

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
unless you're unless you have to be

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.110 
unless you're unless you have to be
full-time<00:03:05.959> for<00:03:06.230> scholarships<00:03:06.769> or<00:03:07.120> other

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
full-time for scholarships or other

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.960 
full-time for scholarships or other
reasons<00:03:08.870> like<00:03:09.079> on<00:03:09.260> oral<00:03:09.560> or<00:03:10.040> Dean's<00:03:10.489> List<00:03:10.700> or

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
reasons like on oral or Dean's List or

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.220 
reasons like on oral or Dean's List or
something<00:03:11.239> like<00:03:11.360> that<00:03:11.510> but<00:03:11.720> if<00:03:11.870> you're<00:03:12.079> not

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
something like that but if you're not

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.349 
something like that but if you're not
and<00:03:12.530> then<00:03:12.739> you<00:03:12.890> have<00:03:13.040> the<00:03:13.130> opportunity<00:03:13.370> to

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:14.359 
and then you have the opportunity to

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:16.569 
and then you have the opportunity to
take<00:03:14.600> less<00:03:15.290> classes<00:03:15.859> that<00:03:16.160> will<00:03:16.370> definitely

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
take less classes that will definitely

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.150 
take less classes that will definitely
help<00:03:17.060> I<00:03:17.329> take<00:03:17.660> about<00:03:17.900> two<00:03:18.320> or<00:03:18.470> three<00:03:18.500> each

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
help I take about two or three each

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.009 
help I take about two or three each
semester<00:03:19.430> instead<00:03:20.000> of<00:03:20.120> the<00:03:20.299> maximum<00:03:20.750> five

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
semester instead of the maximum five

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.080 
semester instead of the maximum five
because<00:03:21.560> that<00:03:21.769> way<00:03:21.890> it<00:03:22.010> gives<00:03:22.130> me<00:03:22.370> more<00:03:23.030> time

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
because that way it gives me more time

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.930 
because that way it gives me more time
to<00:03:23.390> work<00:03:24.200> and<00:03:24.769> also<00:03:25.100> more<00:03:25.400> time<00:03:25.609> to<00:03:25.760> study

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
to work and also more time to study

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.240 
to work and also more time to study
since<00:03:26.570> I'm<00:03:26.720> working<00:03:26.930> a<00:03:27.200> lot<00:03:27.230> of<00:03:27.440> times<00:03:27.650> too<00:03:27.890> and

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
since I'm working a lot of times too and

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.520 
since I'm working a lot of times too and
still<00:03:28.850> be<00:03:29.060> able<00:03:29.209> to<00:03:29.390> you<00:03:29.900> know<00:03:29.930> sometimes

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
still be able to you know sometimes

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.660 
still be able to you know sometimes
socialize<00:03:31.280> and<00:03:31.579> have<00:03:31.780> enjoy<00:03:32.780> my<00:03:33.049> life<00:03:33.590> as<00:03:33.950> I<00:03:34.640> am

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
socialize and have enjoy my life as I am

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:40.960 
socialize and have enjoy my life as I am
right<00:03:35.090> so<00:03:36.010> that's<00:03:37.010> a<00:03:37.220> big<00:03:37.370> one<00:03:39.400> besides<00:03:40.400> that<00:03:40.640> I

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
right so that's a big one besides that I

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.039 
right so that's a big one besides that I
think<00:03:42.070> just<00:03:43.070> being<00:03:43.400> also<00:03:44.090> frugal<00:03:44.750> when<00:03:44.959> it

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
think just being also frugal when it

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:46.900 
think just being also frugal when it
comes<00:03:45.260> to<00:03:45.440> your<00:03:45.530> money<00:03:45.739> like<00:03:46.100> don't<00:03:46.400> go<00:03:46.549> and

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
comes to your money like don't go and

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.690 
comes to your money like don't go and

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:45.640 
beyond that definitely I would say that

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.000 
beyond that definitely I would say that
it<00:04:45.760> is<00:04:45.910> possible<00:04:46.450> to<00:04:46.510> do<00:04:46.750> it<00:04:46.780> without<00:04:47.010> student
