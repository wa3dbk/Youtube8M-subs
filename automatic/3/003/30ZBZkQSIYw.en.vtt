00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
greetings chess friends Ravi again and

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.070 
greetings chess friends Ravi again and
I'm<00:00:04.830> going<00:00:05.069> to<00:00:05.100> do<00:00:05.250> a<00:00:05.460> series<00:00:05.790> of<00:00:06.210> little<00:00:06.629> short

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
I'm going to do a series of little short

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.339 
I'm going to do a series of little short
videos<00:00:08.630> primarily<00:00:09.630> because<00:00:09.809> I<00:00:10.080> get<00:00:10.230> very

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
videos primarily because I get very

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.039 
videos primarily because I get very
tired<00:00:10.679> doing<00:00:11.010> longer<00:00:11.309> videos<00:00:11.759> and<00:00:12.030> I<00:00:12.210> begin<00:00:12.870> to

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
tired doing longer videos and I begin to

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.129 
tired doing longer videos and I begin to
lose<00:00:13.139> my<00:00:13.349> concentration

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:15.139 
lose my concentration

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.529 
lose my concentration
but<00:00:16.139> I'm<00:00:16.320> doing<00:00:17.010> another<00:00:17.369> series<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:18.119> little

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
but I'm doing another series of little

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.870 
but I'm doing another series of little
videos<00:00:19.080> on<00:00:19.350> square<00:00:19.770> strategy<00:00:20.310> theory<00:00:20.580> and

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
videos on square strategy theory and

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.769 
videos on square strategy theory and
looking<00:00:21.420> at<00:00:21.570> weak<00:00:21.750> colour<00:00:22.050> complexes<00:00:23.720> how<00:00:24.720> we

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
looking at weak colour complexes how we

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.250 
looking at weak colour complexes how we
can<00:00:25.050> exploit<00:00:25.470> them<00:00:25.769> that<00:00:26.490> we<00:00:26.580> can<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:27.109> set<00:00:28.109> them

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
can exploit them that we can a set them

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.980 
can exploit them that we can a set them
up<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:28.619> create<00:00:28.769> them<00:00:29.130> I'm<00:00:29.730> looking<00:00:30.599> at<00:00:30.750> the

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
up and create them I'm looking at the

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.900 
up and create them I'm looking at the
dynamics<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.769> PCs<00:00:32.099> in<00:00:32.279> regard<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.759> these

was already a weak color complex on the
board<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.440> we<00:00:46.440> had<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.070> identify<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.090> look

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
board and we had to identify it and look

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.520 
board and we had to identify it and look
for<00:00:49.020> ways<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.350> exploit<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:51.079> however<00:00:52.079> in<00:00:52.379> this

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530

is<00:00:57.500> essentially<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.739> create<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:59.690> weak<00:01:00.690> color

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
is essentially to create a weak color

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
position look at it for as long as you

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.990 
position look at it for as long as you
need<00:01:24.680> and<00:01:25.680> try<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:25.950> think<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.490> how<00:01:27.030> we<00:01:27.990> can

need and try to think of how we can

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.630 
need and try to think of how we can
exploit<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:31.110> position<00:01:31.590> in<00:01:31.770> order<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.340> create

exploit the position in order to create
weak<00:01:32.970> color<00:01:33.270> complexes<00:01:34.909> if<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.000> like<00:01:36.119> to

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
weak color complexes if you like to

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.710 
weak color complexes if you like to
pause<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.600> video<00:01:36.720> do<00:01:37.110> so<00:01:37.290> now<00:01:41.540> well<00:01:42.540> hopefully

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
pause the video do so now well hopefully

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.590 
pause the video do so now well hopefully
you<00:01:42.960> paused<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.320> video<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.670> had

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
you paused the video and and you had

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.240 
you paused the video and and you had
some<00:01:45.840> time<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.110> think<00:01:46.320> about<00:01:46.770> this<00:01:46.890> middle

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
some time to think about this middle

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.050 
some time to think about this middle
game<00:01:47.399> position<00:01:48.740> when<00:01:49.740> we<00:01:49.770> look<00:01:50.009> at<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.880> base

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
game position when we look at the base

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.160 
game position when we look at the base
squares<00:01:52.820> we<00:01:53.820> can<00:01:54.000> see<00:01:54.180> that<00:01:54.329> this<00:01:54.450> square<00:01:54.689> here

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
squares we can see that this square here

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.530 
squares we can see that this square here
on<00:01:55.350> f7<00:01:56.040> is<00:01:56.219> particularly<00:01:56.969> weak<00:01:57.119> being

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
on f7 is particularly weak being

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.870 
on f7 is particularly weak being

of<00:02:00.880> course<00:02:01.210> our<00:02:01.420> spider-sense<00:02:02.290> goes<00:02:02.619> off<00:02:02.799> and

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
of course our spider-sense goes off and

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.260 
of course our spider-sense goes off and
we<00:02:04.119> then<00:02:04.329> take<00:02:04.570> a<00:02:04.630> look<00:02:04.869> at<00:02:04.990> the<00:02:05.110> entire<00:02:06.270> d5

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
we then take a look at the entire d5

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.850 
we then take a look at the entire d5
color<00:02:07.600> complex<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.970> in<00:02:10.750> doing<00:02:10.959> so<00:02:11.050> we<00:02:11.530> can<00:02:11.709> see

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
color complex and in doing so we can see

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.850 
color complex and in doing so we can see

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
order to exchange this point off or make

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.110 
order to exchange this point off or make
it<00:02:33.910> advance<00:02:35.100> then<00:02:36.100> we<00:02:36.190> can<00:02:36.370> see<00:02:36.580> that<00:02:36.940> this

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
it advance then we can see that this

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.500

course<00:06:01.300> there<00:06:01.540> is<00:06:01.630> no<00:06:01.810> defense<00:06:03.780> we<00:06:04.780> simply

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 
course there is no defense we simply

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.820 
course there is no defense we simply
take<00:06:05.260> the<00:06:05.320> pawn<00:06:05.620> on<00:06:05.830> e7<00:06:07.380> and<00:06:08.380> we<00:06:08.560> will<00:06:08.680> of

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
take the pawn on e7 and we will of

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.379 
take the pawn on e7 and we will of
course<00:06:08.860> plan<00:06:09.990> to<00:06:10.990> bring<00:06:11.139> a<00:06:11.260> knight<00:06:11.440> back

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:12.389

advance<00:06:13.389> this<00:06:13.600> pawn<00:06:15.120> and<00:06:16.120> put<00:06:16.330> real<00:06:16.540> pressure

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:16.750 
advance this pawn and put real pressure

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:24.600 
advance this pawn and put real pressure
on<00:06:17.169> blacks<00:06:17.500> position<00:06:22.230> so<00:06:23.230> going<00:06:24.130> back<00:06:24.280> to<00:06:24.340> the

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:24.610 
on blacks position so going back to the

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.030 
on blacks position so going back to the
starting<00:06:25.030> position<00:06:25.410> you<00:06:26.410> had<00:06:26.560> to<00:06:26.650> look<00:06:26.770> at<00:06:26.950> the

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:27.040 
starting position you had to look at the

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.390 
starting position you had to look at the
d5<00:06:27.400> complex<00:06:28.830> we<00:06:29.830> saw<00:06:30.010> that<00:06:30.160> it<00:06:30.310> was

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 
d5 complex we saw that it was

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.129 
d5 complex we saw that it was
particularly<00:06:30.970> weak<00:06:31.210> on<00:06:31.389> it's<00:06:31.570> pretty<00:06:31.720> squares

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:32.139 
particularly weak on it's pretty squares

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:36.330 
particularly weak on it's pretty squares
and<00:06:33.660> we<00:06:34.660> only<00:06:34.840> needed<00:06:35.200> creative<00:06:35.770> ways<00:06:35.979> in

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:36.340 
and we only needed creative ways in

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.909 
and we only needed creative ways in
order<00:06:36.940> for<00:06:37.270> us<00:06:37.300> to<00:06:37.419> exploit<00:06:37.960> that<00:06:38.320> particular

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:38.919 
order for us to exploit that particular

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:41.879 
order for us to exploit that particular
complex<00:06:39.540> and<00:06:40.540> we<00:06:40.630> saw<00:06:40.810> that<00:06:41.050> advancing<00:06:41.770> the

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:41.889 
complex and we saw that advancing the

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:46.830 
complex and we saw that advancing the
pawn<00:06:42.130> a<00:06:42.400> sex<00:06:42.700> did<00:06:43.030> that<00:06:44.220> upon<00:06:45.220> advanced<00:06:45.840> and

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 
pawn a sex did that upon advanced and

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.710 
pawn a sex did that upon advanced and
this<00:06:46.960> entire<00:06:47.350> color<00:06:47.680> complex<00:06:48.360> on<00:06:49.360> the<00:06:49.510> Queen

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:49.720 
this entire color complex on the Queen

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:55.170 
this entire color complex on the Queen
side<00:06:50.310> became<00:06:51.310> weak<00:06:52.979> so<00:06:53.979> hopefully<00:06:54.880> you<00:06:55.000> found

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:55.180 
side became weak so hopefully you found

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.690 
side became weak so hopefully you found
that<00:06:55.330> beneficial<00:06:55.900> I'm<00:06:56.710> going<00:06:57.280> to<00:06:57.340> stop<00:06:57.550> it

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:57.700 
that beneficial I'm going to stop it

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.440 
that beneficial I'm going to stop it
there<00:06:57.729> otherwise<00:06:58.570> I<00:06:58.840> lose<00:06:58.990> concentration<00:06:59.290> and

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:00.450 
there otherwise I lose concentration and

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:03.390 
there otherwise I lose concentration and
I<00:07:01.450> will<00:07:02.080> do<00:07:02.200> another<00:07:02.380> one<00:07:02.530> on<00:07:02.860> how<00:07:03.070> to<00:07:03.130> create

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:03.400 
I will do another one on how to create

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:07.260 
I will do another one on how to create
weak<00:07:04.150> colour<00:07:04.450> complexes
