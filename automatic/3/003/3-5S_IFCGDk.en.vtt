00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:06.750
 The second video today is Monty's Adventure Video. 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:10.830
 I picked Dorothy a few days ago and I did not upload the video. 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:16.080
 Doeseo five lessons today, so I'll try again today, the body 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:19.109
 4 of 5 complex oddities, so do not be with me like hero 12 map 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.820
 I'll give it a try. 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:28.380
 I'll take a look at Dorothy on the big screen. 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:31.859
 4 home as if Sam itguyo so just skip training 0 0 3 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:36.140
 Coming to visit now breaks Chilsung Axel and 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.140
 Anna fosters Axel station or state 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:48.210
 In the case of Lucy, the skill seems to be the same as the upbringing, and now the passive 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:53.519
 There doeneunge activities referred to neutralize look so bitter enemy skill now 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.899
 But as it gets smaller, the attack power is stronger. 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:01:00.629
 Shrinking together 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:04.920
 The speed of movement will also be reduced, and now Dorothy is disabled . 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:09.020
 So I thought a little more gingeo duration think once invoked in bed before 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.020
 I think it's quite good with the effect . 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:18.790
 Once you've seen the requirements apply to mobs all the time in video 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:21.430
 Next time, I'll take a look at the hand applied to the team game. 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:25.990
 222 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:31.259
 Because with both me and Anna, it's a situation. 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:36.090
 I do not think I should get up to 12 maps . 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:39.079
 Because I used attack power as a whole, 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.079
 I can handle it. 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:47.010
 Yobeon even dwaetneunde ship go pumping.We 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.700
 Yes , there is a chance that the disqualification will happen. 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:55.380
 I do not think it 's going to pop out completely 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:02:02.700
 If Skills comes in, it looks like it's popping up. 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:06.119
 The team Match 3 skills when writing yoge just blows one looks really joteulgeot 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.899
 Air force war images'll look out the following 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:14.519
 The first one is the boss, Dorothy quickly took 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:18.110
 One in the Hill together gatgin Anna will be more stable but will dilryang 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.110
 I'll have a 7 with a brush. 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.060
 The speed at which the area passed was almost identical. 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.060
 U 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:35.600
 my 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:35.600
 I guess it's pretty good. 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:43.540
 If fitness is like Dorothy possible because there is no recovery 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.990
 I 'd have to give it a shot when I hit it. 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:53.620
 It still has half the volume. 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:56.250
 I do not have a lot of dill now, but I'm going a little harder. 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.250
 Let's go. 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:06.540
 I have a lot of video recording, but just turning it into a phone is much more 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.540
 It's stable. 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.140
 U 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:22.140
 In the case of Dorothy neutralization, it enters fairly, too 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.140
 Sounds useful. 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:29.000
 I also had the basic requirement for the requirements, and when I died, it got bigger again. 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.000
 U 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.980
 U 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:41.690
 Anyone who tastes the wood for a 1m score 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:45.459
 I think non-nephew enters will be able to catch up more quickly with rubbing one 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.459
 I'll take a look at it. 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:58.110
 If you think about the last time a total of 10 persons when the saga once upon a stone lantern in the incident 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:04:02.819
 The catching speed is so fast that the phenomenon of going back and forth 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:06.650
 But the compound is not so complete as the deal, so at a moderate rate 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.650
 It's not like that. 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:14.620
 Now I've covered the screen a little bit, but now the tree is so small. 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:21.650
 4 The pace I caught at the moment was a little more than that. 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:32.300
 You might be tempted to try a little bit 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:37.350
 When the iPhone is not only a record is not stable deoraguyo back to 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:40.640
 The time was 3 minutes and 52 seconds on the road . 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.640
 If you are like Anna 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.750
 Yoreotge came out four minutes when one elf drawing much complex to another jotahjin 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:53.139
 It's the same. 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:53.139
 4 Next, I'll take a look at the entire video in the team.
