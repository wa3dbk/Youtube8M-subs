00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
I thought 750 is a lot but then if you

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.940 
I thought 750 is a lot but then if you
think<00:02:11.940> about<00:02:12.000> it<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.360> get<00:02:12.510> to

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
flicker stuff to any other color so the

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.110
