left than obama from being a real real
candidate<00:01:52.439> i<00:01:52.560> guess<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:52.920> let's<00:01:53.130> be<00:01:53.280> honest

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
candidate i guess and let's be honest

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.870 
candidate i guess and let's be honest
Hillary<00:01:54.149> Clinton<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.930> in<00:01:55.530> my<00:01:55.770> estimation<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:56.640> is

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
Hillary Clinton I in my estimation is is

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.940 
Hillary Clinton I in my estimation is is
to<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.240> right<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.479> President<00:01:58.110> Obama<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.799> we

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
to the right of President Obama and we

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.109 
to the right of President Obama and we
don't<00:01:59.100> even<00:01:59.189> know<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.520> she's<00:01:59.670> running<00:02:00.030> in

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
don't even know that she's running in

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.789 
don't even know that she's running in
2016<00:02:00.750> but<00:02:00.899> if<00:02:00.990> she<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.259> ultimately<00:02:01.710> the

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
2016 but if she is ultimately the

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.639 
2016 but if she is ultimately the
nominee<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.729> think<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.750> will<00:02:03.869> probably<00:02:04.200> unless

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
nominee I think it will probably unless

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.340 
nominee I think it will probably unless
she<00:02:04.860> evolves<00:02:05.280> on<00:02:05.820> certain<00:02:06.240> issues<00:02:06.360> be<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.079> move

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
she evolves on certain issues be a move

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.100 
she evolves on certain issues be a move
to<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.649> right<00:02:07.829> for<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.190> Democratic<00:02:08.729> Party

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
to the right for the Democratic Party

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.530 
to the right for the Democratic Party
yeah<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.140> probably<00:02:10.560> would<00:02:11.180> unfortunately<00:02:12.180> but

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
yeah I probably would unfortunately but

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.569 
yeah I probably would unfortunately but
it<00:02:13.629> she<00:02:14.170> would<00:02:14.319> probably<00:02:14.590> be<00:02:15.040> better<00:02:15.250> than<00:02:15.459> the

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:15.579 
it she would probably be better than the

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:17.399 
it she would probably be better than the
alternative<00:02:15.700> whoever<00:02:16.540> that<00:02:16.689> may<00:02:16.870> be<00:02:16.900> I<00:02:17.049> think

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:17.409 
alternative whoever that may be I think

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:19.110 
alternative whoever that may be I think
we<00:02:17.500> can<00:02:17.620> probably<00:02:17.799> safely<00:02:18.219> assume<00:02:18.640> that<00:02:18.849> I<00:02:19.060> I

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
we can probably safely assume that I I

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.580 
we can probably safely assume that I I
