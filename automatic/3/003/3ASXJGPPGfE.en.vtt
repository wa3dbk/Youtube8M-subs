 on account 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.840
 30 that is, everything is fine if the match is not 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.460
 look may seem easy 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.860
 victory but in fact the match turned out 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.130
 heavy expected that he will be so 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:21.000
 uneasy still with cellulite bards 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.699
 for us of course there was a very hard game 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.449
 people who watched the group tv 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.420
 and 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.460
 at the stadium also know but we know what 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.199
 he did not think that the tiger would be simple 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.510
 because shooting was played by champions 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.489
 Intel vps server is quite complex 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.890
 server fase 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.300
 especially the farce was there a feeling that you need 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.980
 don't just win achieve the right 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.800
 result but also rehabilitated for 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.450
 defeat in cyprus or today chief 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.480
 there were results in principle no longer about 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:54.000
 than you did not think well, will not take out your 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:56.610
 mates blood I have moments then he 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.980
 opposed moments monks proposed 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.870
 good enough time groups just 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.969
 they had one scoring chance they are you 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.680
 implemented now was about the game 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.619
 like you, too , there were many moments 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.939
 just the enemy team was not 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.920
 the moment to score was not given to him she 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.560
 what is the choice of the case and and after the choice 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.330
 windows just really in the first 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.979
 half in the second one first was especially 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.189
 a lot of things but not 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.810
 goals scored despite it were 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.030
 sure that we will win 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.229
 or 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.939
 Were nervous because something 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.920
 too much like an away match 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:37.409
 We get a series of check you 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.810
 There is no strong will bed 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.030
 Thought you chicks tried and knew that 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.159
 with our players that we have everything 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.140
 we can still score and when 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:51.409
 the stakes have scored the first goal already 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.409
 fairly easier further concerns 1 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.850
 the bright world appeared 1 course and still in 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.830
 the first half there were some moments 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.380
 when it seemed that passion was so much 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.909
 the field was heated that nerves someone 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.710
 can not stand that is already rendered 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.049
 now the real battle begins 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:15.000
 only football it really was 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:17.220
 so or so it seemed tribune principle 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.020
 our team has always been patient and 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.280
 waited a moment to score a goal and and 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:27.269
 finally you are a great moment and work 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.750
 collect him candy and and wore 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.959
 by masses 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.450
 setup world today you have the first match on 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.700

 After this game in this sense, I already 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.830
 gambit lay out us against the zenith but 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.810
 of course this is not the same game I am for 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.360
 Zenith than against I really liked 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.239
