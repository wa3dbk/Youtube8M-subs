00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
 Thank you 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:11.389
 today we prepare pita bread 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.389
 to 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.510
 In this video we will see how the 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.610
 pita bread 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:21.140
 I will also show you some suggestions 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.140
 filling that is delicious 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.900
 we started by dissolving an envelope of 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.250
 yeast in 300 milliliters of water 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.560
 add half a tablespoon of sugar 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.150
 now of fuel for the yeast the 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.100
 Sugar is a food for yeast 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.020
 This time we use yeast 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.059
 Bakery powder instead can 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.370
 use 25 grams of pressed yeast 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.530
 we mix a little and let it rest 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.120
 meanwhile in a bowl we miss 400 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.280
 grams of flour and a pinch of salt 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.770
 We are using force flour 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.030
 flour to make bread we will mix 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.030
 slightly with the help of a spoon 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.859
 as you can see that the yeast is 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.190
 dissolved now we will be throwing the little bit to 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.870
 little about the flour and we will mix 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.519
 the great advantage of having it done in a 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.030
 is that we control much more 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.710
 amounts 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.080
 if we do it at the table, it always 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.610
 spreads more flour and liquid and 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.610
 in this way it is much simpler 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.740
 We will add water and mixing with 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.340
 help from a spoon until making a 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.340
 small ball 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.090
 and now we are going to knead this time 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.710
 let's knead with olive oil 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.710
 we start by squirting our hands 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.250
 and wetting the work table 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.310
 pour the dough and knead 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.930
 we want to stretch and pick up the dough 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.930
 for about 34 minutes 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.140
 well we record with second part of 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.970
 kneading now we will use flour 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.590
 later we will see a little flour on 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.100
 the work table and we do the same 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.020
 that before we stretch and collect the dough 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.240
 In total the kneading should last about 8 o 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.850
 10 minutes this is a good occasion 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.680
 to de-stress we will stretch with 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.680
 you win and we will give you a few taps 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.349
 this the best of the pot 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.209
 well once in addition to the 810 minutes 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.069
 we make a ball and place it on a 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.569
 you can see that at the base of the volleyball 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.700
 we have put sand so that it does not stick 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.980
 we cover it with phil transparent or with 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.970
 a cloth and let it sit for half an hour 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.970
 in a quality area 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.420
 notice that each time in this one stays 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.670
 normal vacuum and this other that that has 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.730
 gifted our friend rossi who passed 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.870
 we will reserve it for another good recipe 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.880
 same about for the filling 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.740
 we started cutting the zucchini first 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.620
 on discs and then on tacos 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.090
 we will do the same with the pepper 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.530
 we will use a red pepper and 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.420
 We will be careful to remove the 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.300
 white parts we cut first in 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.990
 strips and then in dice we will do the same 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.990
 with the tomato 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.319
 we put to heat a jet of oil 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:24.280
 of olive and we throw first the pepper 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.920
 we will let it cook for a 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.329
 minute where you turn the cen when 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.670
 then add the zucchini 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:32.129
 we will do the same thing we give a few laps and 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.019
 we cook for a minute 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:37.659
 aromatize we have chopped parsley and a 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.040
 touch of pepper or cayenne 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:41.500
 I 'm going to throw salt but if you want 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.829
 this would be the moment we give a couple of 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.480
 turns and we throw the tomato we will cook 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:48.900
 on high heat a couple of minutes and 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.900
 we reserve 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.890
 and let's prepare the lettuce we have 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.330
 cleaned the wash and drained well and 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.100
 now we will cut into finite tacos 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.290
 first in a sense and then in the 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.210
 another one we will give a special touch with 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.580
 crab sticks before continuing 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:06.040
 we put to preheat the oven to 250 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.750
 degrees good since we have the mass what 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.630
 we have made a hot day and you see 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.950
 that has gone up one pass we distribute a 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.470
 little flour on the work table 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.090
 and pour the dough then 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.400
 we stretch slightly to remove the 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.170
 air with this mass we could do 12 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.060
 pita breads this time we are going to 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.830
 prepare only 6 I will reserve half 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.960
 to do another little thing at the end of 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.730
 video I explain the following thing that 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.800
 we will do is cut the dough first 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.750
 we will make three more or less equal pieces 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.480
 and then each piece we live in half 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.010
 and the process is simple and we'll see 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.200
 crushing and making it shape with 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.600
 help from the hand we will do the same with 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.460
 the other pieces we put paper of 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.580
 bake on a tray and we distribute 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.220
 the loaves above 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.800
 where will we do at 250 degrees for about 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.740
 5 or 6 minutes 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.090
 As you can see the pita bread goes up and 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.129
 It comes a time when it is inflated and 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.490
 separates leaving that characteristic gap 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.490
 inside 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.280
 as soon as you have uploaded and picked up the color 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:05.370
 we remove it we let it rest 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.530
 minutes 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.270
 well now we go with the filling we have 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.590
 let warm the bread and cut the 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.960
 half doing a kind of mouth 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.580
 and you know the gap that remains for this 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.070
 we are going to fill it, we will start 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.170
 with the lettuce a little yogurt sauce 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.820
 and garlic on top of the video 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:25.820
 We leave link to the sauce 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:28.960
 yogurt and garlic the sticks 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.960
 our vegetable ratatouille 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.340
 and we end with lettuce sauce and sticks 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.620
