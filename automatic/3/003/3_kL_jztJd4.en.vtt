00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.020
 but still it would be good to see how we can not be sure of 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.230
 the euro zone that would seriously damage the reputation of destruction 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.980
 favorite electronic arts get around the problem 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.789
 by offering a much more digestible shooting game 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.749
 with such abuses 

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:23.999
 how to assume 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:28.799
 the atmosphere is it as scary as on xbox 360 or station 3 is that 

00:00:28.799 --> 00:00:31.799
 that we will see right away 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.760
 the express extraction is once again proof that the games 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.320
 concretely on the lists 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.070
 the modeling of the characters is well done the effects of shadows and 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.850
 lights control themselves on the fingertips 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.770
 it's size is multiplying on the screen without it hurting the 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.800
 fluidity of animation 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.480
 the studio visceral games has therefore strived to respect the codes 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.070
 artistic set up last year on the xbox 360 and 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.050
 playstation 3 which ensures a certain continuity in the 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.050
 visual quality 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.670
 as for the scenario it takes place before the arrival of visa clark aboard the 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.430
 ship the Chinese and there we discovered women red monolith on 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.080
 the planet and seven 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.360
 this find precipitated the entire population of the space mine in a 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.360
 deadly madness no one will escape escaped here 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.920
 finally almost since the player should slip into the skin of 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.750
 one of the survivors trying to save his skin he operates four packs 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.880
 what is really amazing with texts extraction is the foulness 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.880
 Wink to those who came to the end of the original episode 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.330
 we cross indeed some places of China will have already visited in 2008 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.330
 and the bestiary remains identical to that of the first episode 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.049
 but the fact of not being able to completely control the mu 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.320
 the name of his character as quickly as possible 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.320
 this naturally reinforces the scary atmosphere of the game 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.870
 the family comes especially when you have to deal with several waves of 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.050
 monsters coming from all sides 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.650
 in these cases we are happy to be able to count on a dozen weapons 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.700
 to fight your way through all these creatures 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.940
 bloodthirsty 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.180
 luckily everyone but with a secondary function particularly 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.110
 useful and for that cbs it will be enough to rotate the bimota the right or 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.369
 towards the left 

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:16.479
 besides the handling of defeat extraction allows to play with or without 

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:17.559
 doubt the fear 

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:20.379
 while the second player any action we do not see it 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:22.549
 would be content with the current measures 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:25.439
 the pressure against it responds present even if we note some tremors 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:26.369
 Sometimes 

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:29.369
 which can be annoying when you are going to hack the doors 

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:33.730
 in 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.730
 the pigs with the of the series 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:38.400
