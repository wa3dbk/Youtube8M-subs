00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
we're ready to do some slicing and

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.039 
we're ready to do some slicing and
dicing<00:00:11.670> so<00:00:12.300> hopefully<00:00:12.630> we<00:00:12.719> don't<00:00:12.809> chop

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
dicing so hopefully we don't chop

about<00:00:38.790> sugar<00:00:39.180> cane<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.570> like<00:00:39.750> when<00:00:39.899> you<00:00:39.989> chop

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
about sugar cane is like when you chop

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.030 
about sugar cane is like when you chop
the<00:00:40.290> top<00:00:40.440> off<00:00:40.620> here<00:00:40.860> like<00:00:41.239> so<00:00:42.530> you<00:00:43.530> can<00:00:43.680> replant

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
the top off here like so you can replant

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.479 
the top off here like so you can replant
it<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.460> can<00:00:44.610> take<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:44.879> bit<00:00:45.120> off<00:00:45.950> and<00:00:46.950> then

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
it you can take this bit off and then

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.850 
it you can take this bit off and then
you<00:00:47.789> just<00:00:47.820> replant<00:00:48.480> this<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.469> will<00:00:49.680> turn

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
you just replant this and this will turn

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.939 
you just replant this and this will turn
it<00:00:50.039> into<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.280> fresh<00:00:50.579> big<00:00:50.879> plant<00:00:51.680> like<00:00:52.680> one<00:00:52.829> of

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
it into a fresh big plant like one of

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.920 
it into a fresh big plant like one of
these<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.820> closer<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.390> root<00:00:54.570> should<00:00:54.750> go

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
these the closer to the root should go

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.680 
these the closer to the root should go
the<00:00:55.860> more<00:00:56.039> important<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.460> sugar<00:00:56.640> cane<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:57.090> so

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
the more important of sugar cane is so

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.939 
the more important of sugar cane is so
the<00:00:57.780> harder<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.289> better<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.649> sugar

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
the harder it is the better the sugar

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.590 
the harder it is the better the sugar
cane<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.340> while<00:00:59.940> so<00:01:00.210> you're<00:01:00.359> going<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.510> be

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
cane of a while so you're going to be

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.180 
cane of a while so you're going to be
careful<00:01:00.840> because<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.379> leaves<00:01:01.590> on<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.920> sugar

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
careful because the leaves on the sugar

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.980 
careful because the leaves on the sugar
cane<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.699> quite<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.149> cheap

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
actually see when you're chopping it you

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.370 
actually see when you're chopping it you
can<00:01:49.759> see<00:01:50.000> water<00:01:50.360> but<00:01:50.750> all<00:01:50.869> the<00:01:51.020> moisture

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
can see water but all the moisture

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.190 
can see water but all the moisture
coming<00:01:51.590> out<00:01:52.479> that's<00:01:53.479> the<00:01:53.600> goodness<00:01:53.959> coming

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
coming out that's the goodness coming

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.289 
coming out that's the goodness coming
out<00:01:54.409> you<00:01:54.890> never<00:01:55.009> go<00:01:55.280> first<00:01:55.549> in<00:01:55.729> a<00:01:55.850> sugar<00:01:56.000> cane

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
out you never go first in a sugar cane

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.139 
out you never go first in a sugar cane
field<00:01:57.039> is<00:01:58.039> there's<00:01:58.250> so<00:01:58.369> much<00:01:58.429> juice<00:01:58.759> inside

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
field is there's so much juice inside

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.809 
field is there's so much juice inside
one<00:01:59.330> of<00:01:59.360> these<00:01:59.509> plants<00:01:59.950> but<00:02:00.950> the<00:02:01.220> hardest<00:02:01.580> part

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:01.819 
one of these plants but the hardest part

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:14.610 
one of these plants but the hardest part
is<00:02:01.939> trying<00:02:02.149> to<00:02:02.299> peel<00:02:02.479> it

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.229 

it's<00:02:15.069> actually<00:02:15.370> very<00:02:15.459> dangerous<00:02:15.670> to<00:02:16.000> use

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
it's actually very dangerous to use

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.000 
it's actually very dangerous to use
bowler<00:02:16.450> knives<00:02:16.750> as<00:02:16.900> well<00:02:16.930> so<00:02:17.319> you<00:02:17.830> have<00:02:17.920> to

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
bowler knives as well so you have to

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.770 
bowler knives as well so you have to
make<00:02:18.159> sure<00:02:18.190> when<00:02:18.670> working<00:02:19.060> as<00:02:19.299> a<00:02:19.330> group<00:02:19.540> that

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
make sure when working as a group that

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.080 
make sure when working as a group that
you're<00:02:19.989> quite<00:02:20.409> far<00:02:21.340> away<00:02:21.459> from<00:02:21.790> each<00:02:21.879> other

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
you're quite far away from each other

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.319 
you're quite far away from each other
because<00:02:22.810> if<00:02:23.080> not<00:02:23.260> could<00:02:24.159> be<00:02:24.220> missing<00:02:24.580> a<00:02:24.700> toe

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:25.329 
because if not could be missing a toe

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:27.300 
because if not could be missing a toe
and<00:02:25.629> you<00:02:25.810> won't<00:02:25.959> even<00:02:26.049> realize<00:02:26.260> it<00:02:26.680> all<00:02:27.129> right

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
and you won't even realize it all right

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:24.510 
would be really good but you know this
is<00:03:09.910> what<00:03:10.030> we<00:03:10.120> have<00:03:10.300> oh<00:03:11.400> my<00:03:12.400> gosh<00:03:23.340> from<00:03:24.340> that

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520
