how<00:02:05.479> does<00:02:05.539> this<00:02:05.689> work<00:02:05.899> Dave<00:02:06.229> basically<00:02:06.799> what

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
how does this work Dave basically what

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:08.619 
how does this work Dave basically what
you<00:02:07.159> should<00:02:07.489> take<00:02:07.640> the<00:02:07.759> tube<00:02:07.969> and<00:02:08.269> you<00:02:08.329> put<00:02:08.539> it

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.629 
you should take the tube and you put it

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:11.259 
you should take the tube and you put it
in<00:02:08.750> slot<00:02:08.959> like<00:02:09.200> so<00:02:09.470> and<00:02:10.160> then<00:02:11.000> you<00:02:11.090> pull<00:02:11.239> down

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
in slot like so and then you pull down

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:13.360 
in slot like so and then you pull down
on<00:02:11.450> the<00:02:11.660> lever<00:02:11.810> you<00:02:12.110> cannot<00:02:12.680> pull<00:02:13.010> down<00:02:13.160> on<00:02:13.310> the

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
on the lever you cannot pull down on the

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.039 
on the lever you cannot pull down on the
lever<00:02:13.549> unless<00:02:13.879> the<00:02:14.060> tube<00:02:14.299> is<00:02:14.540> in<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:14.780> slide

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 
lever unless the tube is in the slide

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:17.050 
lever unless the tube is in the slide
that's<00:02:15.470> that's<00:02:15.769> a<00:02:15.920> smart<00:02:16.220> idea<00:02:16.400> this<00:02:16.910> is

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
that's that's a smart idea this is

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.030 
that's that's a smart idea this is
actually<00:02:17.510> portion<00:02:17.930> control<00:02:18.290> as<00:02:18.440> well<00:02:18.620> so<00:02:18.890> if<00:02:18.950> I

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
actually portion control as well so if I

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.830 
actually portion control as well so if I
pull<00:02:19.280> down<00:02:19.310> and<00:02:19.700> hold<00:02:19.879> it<00:02:20.030> there's<00:02:20.599> only<00:02:20.750> a

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
pull down and hold it there's only a

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.030 
pull down and hold it there's only a
certain<00:02:21.019> amount<00:02:21.290> that<00:02:21.440> you<00:02:21.560> got<00:02:21.650> to<00:02:21.739> come<00:02:21.890> out
