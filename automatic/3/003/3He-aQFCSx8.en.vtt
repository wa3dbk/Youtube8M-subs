00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:07.290
 the wind of hayao miyazaki vote rises 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.300
 9 the last film miyazaki testament 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.210
 after that, as I said, it will be withdrawn 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.429
 a masterpiece on those few cases in which 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.279
 the word masterpiece is not wasted a 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.380
 movie that maybe is finally until he 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.920
 he wanted to do long since I'm not there 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.900
 there are practically no weird figures 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.880
 fantastic characters that got me a lot 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.250
 an era that he has anchored to reality 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.470
 lived as a child goes through a bit 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.890
 throughout the first half of the twentieth century 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.360
 Japanese in evolution you don't see 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.059
 the aeronautics that is known with whom he loves 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.750
 so the planes die so no totoro 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.399
 and as many planes as he always liked 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.890
 this style of miyazaki of the times of 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.010
 conan the boy of the future in short 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.899
 stories very anchored to reality too 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.680
 if in a fantasy world wii is more 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.840
 realistic 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.899
 although there are so many dreamlike scenes in 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.399
 whose tribute to fellini and in which in short 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.710
 globally this film tells of it 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.040
 so many transmit so much on their own 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.960
 miyazaki person and an incredible style 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.540
 line cleaning and animation 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.270
 that at times moving from perfection 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.369
 and reaches an eternal film and others 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.090
 times of an animation like you don't 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.799
 saw 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.990
 you no longer see it because now with all 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.700
 the movies in 3d see a movie like that 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.680
 it really is something that fills you 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.770
 eyes and excites you in every shot 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.200
 no memorable characters scene one 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.750
 very introspective story a flow 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.509
 narrative that truly overwhelms you 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.570
 powerful movie perfection in all fields 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.340
 a painstaking and refined job and it is 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.650
 just the legacy in such artists 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.990
 which here probably reaches its peak 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.270
 of his career, in short, oozes with 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.310
 all the visual narrative experience 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.740
 stylistic of this artist 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.750
 don't miss it unfortunately it is in the room 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.670
 very few days recovered you do it 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.130
 how you want but this movie for calls 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.220
 animation with Japanese culture 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:04.330
 or at least the great cinema is from 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:07.090
 see and this time exceptional guests 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.570
 I did not mind them that 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.660
 I show directly this way 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.900
 and the impact of being a beast among froggers 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.340
 laugh from http and what you tell us 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.470
 but regardless of the animation 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:25.780
 however I liked it I was two 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:28.510
 hours in coma watching it for me anyway it has 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.860
 knew how to make good what he wanted 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.650
 render also through animation 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.180
 because I liked very much i 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.030
 pieces in which traveling with the imagination 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.160
 even by simply writing on paper 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.170
 inside we say the mind of 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.450
 protagonist the planes were flying yes 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.459
 they destroyed the network graphically 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.140
 sir, you loved it very much 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.800
 made him fall with his own 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.050
 projects 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.540
 here was that piece my own dead 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.670
 transmits the alcohol and the estimate between 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.980
 it was up to the sense of failure of 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.360
 even incompleteness that he could hear 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.700
 the protagonist in seeing his own 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:06.780
 planes like ducks of paper that goes 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.780
 good metal 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.370
 no because this is the post then 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.840
 it was necessary to say something important that 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.349
 came to my mind in the car 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.150
 I forgot to mention that it is one 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:25.330
 what we have there turns out was the 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.870
 fact that it is not a spoiler I can 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.000
 to say 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.400
 the noise of the planes is not a 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.720
 element that is often proposed in 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.000
 all the movie because it's based on that 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.980
 it is made with the voices, that is, it is heard 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.829
 clearly that it is not an airplane sound 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:43.299
 but silent that to the voice that it is made 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:44.769
 so nothing is something that makes them 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.480
 very human is one thing that I liked 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.160
 very very much 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.810
 nothing I wanted I wanted to say this 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.510
 what because in my opinion the guarantor is there 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.129
 everything here you render and therefore miyazaki is 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:04:00.160
 managed to occupy even the 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:04:02.910
 planes despite what and at wings e 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.910
 who will kill everyone
