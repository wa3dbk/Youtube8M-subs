00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
maybe win the game the guy wasn't a

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.300 
maybe win the game the guy wasn't a
really<00:03:21.420> really<00:03:21.660> bad<00:03:21.810> player<00:03:22.170> but<00:03:22.830> it<00:03:22.980> was<00:03:23.100> just

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
really really bad player but it was just

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.530 
really really bad player but it was just
little<00:03:23.519> things<00:03:23.670> like<00:03:23.880> this<00:03:24.060> like<00:03:24.300> you<00:03:24.360> could

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
little things like this like you could

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.660 
little things like this like you could
tell<00:03:24.720> he<00:03:25.440> was<00:03:25.560> containing<00:03:26.100> really<00:03:26.310> hard<00:03:26.519> and

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
tell he was containing really hard and

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.460 
tell he was containing really hard and
then<00:03:26.820> I<00:03:27.030> could<00:03:27.570> just<00:03:27.750> like<00:03:27.870> pretty<00:03:28.080> much<00:03:28.140> do

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
then I could just like pretty much do

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.650 
then I could just like pretty much do
circles<00:03:28.830> around<00:03:28.950> him<00:03:29.220> so<00:03:29.420> Benson<00:03:30.420> gets<00:03:30.570> the

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
circles around him so Benson gets the

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:31.910 
circles around him so Benson gets the
second<00:03:30.900> goal<00:03:30.989> in<00:03:31.080> the<00:03:31.110> 23rd<00:03:31.470> minute<00:03:31.620> and<00:03:31.860> the

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
second goal in the 23rd minute and the

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.160 
second goal in the 23rd minute and the
reason<00:03:32.190> I<00:03:32.250> didn't<00:03:32.459> bid<00:03:32.640> for<00:03:32.910> I<00:03:33.150> was<00:03:33.900> sure<00:03:33.930> I'll

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
reason I didn't bid for I was sure I'll

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.390 
reason I didn't bid for I was sure I'll
be<00:03:34.290> right<00:03:34.470> in<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:34.680> beginning<00:03:34.800> is<00:03:35.070> because<00:03:35.310> of
