00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
it on my desktop right now but this is

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
it on my desktop right now but this is
let's<00:01:12.730> just<00:01:12.910> say<00:01:13.060> this<00:01:13.420> is<00:01:13.660> the<00:01:14.340> clip<00:01:15.340> click<00:01:16.090> it

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
let's just say this is the clip click it

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.840 
let's just say this is the clip click it
and<00:01:16.890> before<00:01:17.890> you<00:01:18.160> import<00:01:18.880> it<00:01:20.070> on<00:01:21.070> click

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
and before you import it on click

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.390 
and before you import it on click
optimize<00:01:22.270> video<00:01:23.080> if<00:01:23.320> you<00:01:23.500> optimize<00:01:23.920> it<00:01:24.100> it's

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
optimize video if you optimize it it's

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.320 
optimize video if you optimize it it's
not<00:01:24.580> going<00:01:24.790> to<00:01:24.880> work

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
not going to work

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.240 
not going to work

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
so it's unclick that and import I

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.970 
so it's unclick that and import I
already<00:01:27.670> have<00:01:27.850> it<00:01:27.970> so<00:01:28.150> then<00:01:28.960> it'll<00:01:29.350> import

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:29.980 
already have it so then it'll import

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.330 
already have it so then it'll import
