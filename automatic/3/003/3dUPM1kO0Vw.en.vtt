00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:12.210
 description movie house cool but that's it 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.870
 miracle in vain prevented the spy quest guys like 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.430
 history think you often believe here 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:20.520
 the main thing here is wood need somehow already 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.910
 keep it cool I think the house 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.910
 cool 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.609
 It is certainly all well looking forward with the help 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.070
 changes your house by the way yes 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.370

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.380
 thanks and so this is of course all 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.920
 Good thing we built this one 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.930
 called the hut but the main problems 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.219
 also need to get to the place with 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.350
 this incomprehensible new place 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:51.120
 but without food and we will not go far again 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.300
 help us run out of what we found 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:01:00.570
 the plane before we need to get somewhere to eat 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.309
 so you need to think you need to make up again 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.339
 plan because the plan to work much 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.930
 easier around us is full of water maybe 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.240
 water to eat fish can be a matter 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.520
 some kind of harpoon or something in it 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.979
 kind to catch his fishing pole 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.890

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:21.119

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.040
 something on trees by the way this here is a crap 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.740
 which can now be used weighed 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:45.240
 cows that you can buy here's yours 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.490

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:34.310
 that mushrooms are famous for taking the stage 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.540
 This world can already be known
