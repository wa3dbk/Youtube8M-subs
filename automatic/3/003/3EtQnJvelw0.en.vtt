to<00:02:02.909> shoot<00:02:03.240> our<00:02:03.360> arrows<00:02:03.719> across<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.259> water

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
to shoot our arrows across the water

the<00:02:10.319> idea<00:02:10.619> is<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:10.890> bounce<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.280> arrow<00:02:11.430> along

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
the idea is to bounce the arrow along

water my second attempt the angle is too
narrow<00:02:21.989> and<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:22.530> bounced<00:02:22.860> off<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.069> water<00:02:23.250> and
