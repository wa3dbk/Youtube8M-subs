assembled an order

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.130 
assembled an order
so<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:24.010> deck<00:00:24.250> is<00:00:24.460> basically<00:00:25.060> eight<00:00:25.480> monsters

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
so the deck is basically eight monsters

it's<00:00:49.270> begun<00:00:49.540> so<00:00:50.320> we're<00:00:50.680> starting<00:00:51.129> with

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
it's begun so we're starting with

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.660 
it's begun so we're starting with
three<00:00:54.190> libraries<00:00:56.110> so<00:00:57.110> I<00:00:57.140> think<00:00:57.440> for<00:00:57.950> an<00:00:58.280> exotic

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
three libraries so I think for an exotic

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.780 
three libraries so I think for an exotic
that<00:00:58.940> this<00:00:59.150> is<00:00:59.330> self-explanatory<00:01:00.730> there<00:01:01.730> are

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
that this is self-explanatory there are

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.460 
that this is self-explanatory there are
a<00:01:01.820> lot<00:01:01.940> of<00:01:01.970> Exodia<00:01:02.450> builds<00:01:02.780> like<00:01:02.900> this<00:01:03.110> out

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
a lot of Exodia builds like this out

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.600 
a lot of Exodia builds like this out
there<00:01:05.170> basically<00:01:06.170> good<00:01:06.770> for<00:01:07.010> drawing<00:01:07.400> power

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
there basically good for drawing power

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.850 
there basically good for drawing power

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
every time you activate a spell you get

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.170 
every time you activate a spell you get
a<00:01:09.890> counter<00:01:10.340> take<00:01:10.729> three<00:01:10.940> off<00:01:11.090> drawcard

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 
basically the deck I might have I might

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:34.499 
basically the deck I might have I might
add<00:05:30.099> hand<00:05:30.550> destruction<00:05:31.330> and<00:05:33.209> into<00:05:34.209> the<00:05:34.330> void

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:34.509 
add hand destruction and into the void

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:36.989 
add hand destruction and into the void
but<00:05:35.050> other<00:05:35.259> than<00:05:35.469> that<00:05:35.559> that's<00:05:36.429> the<00:05:36.759> build
