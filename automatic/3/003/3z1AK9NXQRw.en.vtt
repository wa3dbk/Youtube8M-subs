00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.960
 yes hello and welcome to 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:11.090
 another video in this video 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:14.910
 it's about how I water my 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:17.490
 year of my rectangular pool with the help of 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.880
 solar heat and with the help of pellets 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:25.740
 warm up at the beginning I'll show you 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.330
 just a moment ago the pool is now in 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.740
 moment in the plane covered due 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.239
 the result of insects and so on 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:36.480
 the cool it is not too big 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.510
 Maybe there's two, I think 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.230
 three meters short so it is not 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.420
 so big but he has it normally 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.910
 Filterung that you her her tubing 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.590
 He is also chlorinated that is 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.059
 no and old ones should actually 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.370
 can not form 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.710
 and unfortunately he only has at the moment 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.760
 So far, he only has so far 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.940
 a catholic filter as 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.600
 filtration system to be but better by 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.559
 should replace a gentler 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.830
 but in this video, it's all about the 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.360
 Warming up the water and that catches 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.860
 everything with this black dots here 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.000
 on 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.430
 the water gets through this yellow 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.430
 hose into the pool we introduce 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.140
 sucked the water as the pump sucks 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.900
 way from the pool to pump is then in 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.700
 this green hose here 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:27.210
 which then runs along here you can see 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.189
 yes here runs runs along because here 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.720
 continue along until he finally 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:36.439
 come out here and then ends here and 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.600
 then that we are at the moment of the road 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:43.860
 then turned off what he is here 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.990
 about this hose in this channel and 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.430
 in this cable channel that one 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.790
 check valve which simply the 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.060
 Flow direction optimized here and 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.979
 then comes two ostriches up there 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:59.130
 and just in the jam with the water 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.440
 pumped the water on the roof and on 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.030
 the roof 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.950
 there are just there are hoses 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.910
 misplaced one can see bad but 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.980
 that is misplaced and these hoses 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.270
 just absorb the heat of the sun 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.180
 that means it flows into the water 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.750
 Hoses heats up and then comes 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.100
 heated 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:25.220
 through the 2 comes the heated then 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.690
 then it flows down again 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.180
 this time through this yellow hose 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:34.010
 let the water continue through 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:36.500
 this hose and then ends here in 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.260
 this flowerpot 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.500
 this is nothing but one of mine 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.490
 self-built padded burner so that 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.470
 I've been in one before 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.450
 other video of this part here aware 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.270
 I painted it now that's her name 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.800
 something nice happened out of here 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.400
 actually following the water 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.960
 circulated through a copper spiral and 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.540
 around this copper spiral when patches 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.960
 I burned a fan for that 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.440
 better said two and these 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:09.260
 backdrop care for the optimum 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:12.860
 kindle the fire and the water like 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:17.150
 So I put it in the back and flows 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.850
 out here again and the heated water 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.700
 then flows out of here again 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:26.330
 then runs along here again 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.760
 then back in here and then that's it 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.980
 this red hose and that ends then 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.950
 here my pool and much slower 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:37.000
 water in the rhine and it more clearly 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.959
 because can show you 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.160
 You can do that very badly 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.580
 but see the thermometer what shows 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.040
 29 degrees 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.560
 that's as badwasser has pretty much too 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.170
 pleasant was perhaps even warmer than 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.940
 some swimming pool so definitely that 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.290
 water then pool is pleasantly heated 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.570
 no cables can form 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.250
 because of the toilet and the filtering 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.470
 that also means in hoses here 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.690
 no germs were formed 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.580
 form 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:07.070
 and what I think is good 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.020
 that the water is heated in two phases 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.530
 is just a time just by the heat of 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.550
 Sun 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.720
 maybe you can do that ten but there 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.810
 above you can see a part of that 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.340
 black hose takes the event so 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:22.430
 He just absorbs the heat of the sun 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:24.080
 and in the second in the second flows 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.479
 just the water here again underneath and 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.460
 then flows into this burner here 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:29.660
 and then we have a second time 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.430
 warm and I think that's pretty good 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.780
 because if it's something we already warmed up 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.500
 I need less here 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:38.330
 energy to heat the water 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.610
 and if i use this pipe here with panels 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.950
 I can feel quite a half 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.060
 for hours 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.520
 to heat it up and that was half an hour 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.800
 hour nicely warmed and this 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.740
 burner here it manages about 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.479
 differences pump a bit of the 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.910
 it actually creates the water 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:58.099
 ten degrees warmer that is to say 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:01.210
 if the water with I say 15 degrees 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:04.340
 income comes out with 25 degrees again 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.479
 That impressed me a lot 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.669
 link the video too 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:09.890
 this burner in one in the 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:11.270
 description means you can do that 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.590
 watch video for this part here 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.229
 That's why I've got 1 already 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.970
 turned off and just burn 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:23.020
 easy to see normal pellets 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:26.020
 yes here completely normal hurt and 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:28.990
 yes, so much so much so good 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.539
 that was actually how it was 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:35.020
 I 'll just do a few things 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:37.000
 hack description and as always applies 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:40.150
 yes subscribe comment 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.750
 You are welcome to lay your questions in 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:47.470
 comments on now at it 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:49.330
 water otherwise I hope you 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:53.889
 I hope that you like the video 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:56.789
 has and would say bye is for 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:56.789
 next video
