and you can see my friends over there on
the<00:01:10.830> other<00:01:10.920> side<00:01:11.039> so<00:01:11.429> we're<00:01:11.610> both<00:01:11.729> up<00:01:12.030> here<00:01:12.060> and

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:12.539 
the other side so we're both up here and

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:13.609 
the other side so we're both up here and
we're<00:01:12.690> in<00:01:12.720> god<00:01:12.869> mode<00:01:13.050> now<00:01:13.229> here's<00:01:13.410> a<00:01:13.470> little

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
we're in god mode now here's a little

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.440 
we're in god mode now here's a little
replay<00:01:14.039> over<00:01:14.250> here<00:01:14.460> it's<00:01:14.880> really<00:01:15.179> not<00:01:15.390> that

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
replay over here it's really not that

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.120 
replay over here it's really not that
hard<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.780> do<00:01:15.960> just<00:01:16.229> jump<00:01:16.380> on<00:01:16.530> top<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.979> and

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
hard to do just jump on top of it and

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.730 
hard to do just jump on top of it and
strafe<00:01:17.430> jump<00:01:17.790> onto<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.420> gate<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:18.990> then<00:01:19.590> you

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
strafe jump onto the gate and then you

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.710 
strafe jump onto the gate and then you
can<00:01:19.860> jump<00:01:20.130> on<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.549> either<00:01:20.820> side<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.509> gate

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
can jump on to either side of the gate

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.080 
can jump on to either side of the gate
whichever<00:01:22.200> one<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:22.680> choose<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:23.280> when<00:01:23.909> you're

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
whichever one you choose and when you're

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.969 
whichever one you choose and when you're
up<00:01:24.270> there<00:01:24.299> every<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:24.990> often<00:01:25.170> they<00:01:25.409> do<00:01:25.470> hit<00:01:25.799> you

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
up there every so often they do hit you

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.280 
up there every so often they do hit you
but<00:01:26.220> mainly<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.390> doesn't<00:01:27.659> do<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.750> whole<00:01:27.990> lot<00:01:28.140> of

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
but mainly it doesn't do a whole lot of

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.510 
but mainly it doesn't do a whole lot of
damage<00:01:28.500> because<00:01:28.979> they<00:01:29.100> have<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.340> shoot

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
damage because they have to shoot

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.719 
damage because they have to shoot
through<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.850> fence<00:01:30.150> so<00:01:30.900> um<00:01:31.290> yeah<00:01:32.280> but<00:01:32.610> then

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
through the fence so um yeah but then

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.399 
through the fence so um yeah but then
again<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:33.180> don't<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.810> can't<00:01:33.990> shoot<00:01:34.140> them<00:01:34.259> all

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
again you don't you can't shoot them all

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.780 
again you don't you can't shoot them all
out<00:01:34.590> either<00:01:34.799> but<00:01:34.979> it's<00:01:35.159> still<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.400> really<00:01:35.759> cool

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
out either but it's still a really cool

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.880 
out either but it's still a really cool
glitch<00:01:36.060> so<00:01:36.570> if<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.900> jump<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.229> this<00:01:37.320> side<00:01:37.560> and

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
glitch so if you jump to this side and

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.420 
glitch so if you jump to this side and
the<00:01:38.790> best<00:01:39.329> thing<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.600> do<00:01:39.840> is<00:01:40.140> if<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:40.920> go<00:01:41.040> prone

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
the best thing to do is if you go prone

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.730 
the best thing to do is if you go prone
really<00:01:42.299> none<00:01:42.689> of<00:01:42.869> them<00:01:43.020> can't<00:01:43.350> hit<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:43.619> every

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
really none of them can't hit you every

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.010 
really none of them can't hit you every
