 minecraft 13w 38 c and I'll show you 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:20.800
 what I had not shown in the 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.390
 last episode or I talk to you about 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.699
 new workstations with regard to 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:30.160
 the audio though all the audio there is 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:33.129
 minecraft I mean monsters time claire 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.329
 weather intent climate then rain e 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:37.360
 all the rest 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.590
 and so on did not show it to me at 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.750
 course and pisodio because I wanted 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.510
 focus on the filters and in any case the 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.879
 video lasted so long while this is a 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.020
 Mini video where I talk memo 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.670
 this topic 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.340
 let's see immediately click east 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.579
 let's go into options and then music and sound 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.379
 how do you see first and master volume is at 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.250
 already one hundred percent are all for one hundred 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.829
 one hundred 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.350
 the first master volume point if it is 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.990
 decrease of my love the music that is 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.920
 there is music and climate 

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:11.310
 the overall audio decreases while if 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.510
 we decrease music or the second 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.360
 only the music we listen to decreases 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.130
 in minecraft every death of Pope when 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.370
 the one that disturbs us anyway 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.570
 we always decrease the third one instead 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.030
 allows to decrease 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.610
 regarding the audio of the climate 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.720
 or snow and rain and so on 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:34.560
 the fourth instead for enemy monsters 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.090
 or animi monsters such as spiders 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.370
 zombies the nocturnal ones that kill us 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.240
 always players instead of the 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.560
 character then places and so on 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.940
 this instead allows us to decrease 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.320
 the music that comes from the not blocks e 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.840
 or when we insert the disc or 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.270
 we create it in the north blocks this one 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.220
 instead as regards the blocks there is 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.750
 when we travel the blocks when there 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:03.910
 we pass over and then it was and us 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.730
 animals these are friendly animals 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.400
 or those we have with us ad 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.560
 example the wolf is like that 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:14.200
 diminishing I remind you that eliminating the 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.680
 music I'm saying by decreasing the options 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.050
 and so on of everyone you can listen 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.970
 what I like to hear 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.830
 always if you want to listen to music but 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.030
 don't feel like listening to the rain on 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.410
 character the blocks all the rest 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.740
 you diminish everything except music and so 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.260
 away you can modify it as a note 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:38.770
 of pleasure and that's all for it 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:41.020
