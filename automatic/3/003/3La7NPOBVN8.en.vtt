00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
it's really easy

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.490 
it's really easy
um<00:00:27.090> if<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.750> just<00:00:27.930> don't<00:00:28.080> think<00:00:28.170> about<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:28.410> too

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
um if you just don't think about it too

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.880 
um if you just don't think about it too
hard<00:00:28.800> it's<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.130> lot<00:00:29.340> simpler<00:00:29.760> than<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.269> seems

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
hard it's a lot simpler than it seems

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.020 
hard it's a lot simpler than it seems
mine<00:00:31.890> is<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.009> lot<00:00:32.219> thicker<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.640> braid<00:00:32.820> as<00:00:32.940> you

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
mine is a lot thicker of a braid as you

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.240 
mine is a lot thicker of a braid as you
can<00:00:33.210> see<00:00:33.420> but<00:00:33.899> that's<00:00:34.110> completely<00:00:34.710> up<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:34.980> you

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
can see but that's completely up to you

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.860 
can see but that's completely up to you
when<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.579> do<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:35.880> just<00:00:35.910> takes<00:00:36.270> smaller

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
when you do it just takes smaller

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.200 
when you do it just takes smaller
strands<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.350> hair<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.770> it'll<00:00:38.340> make<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.879> lot

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
strands of hair and it'll make it a lot

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.000 
strands of hair and it'll make it a lot
smaller<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:39.989> lot<00:00:40.140> closer<00:00:40.320> together<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.890> a

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
smaller and a lot closer together and a

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.889 
smaller and a lot closer together and a
lot<00:00:41.219> more<00:00:41.250> intricate<00:00:41.850> but<00:00:42.360> just<00:00:42.600> for<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.750> sake

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
lot more intricate but just for the sake

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.660 
lot more intricate but just for the sake
of<00:00:42.930> time<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.469> did<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.770> in<00:00:43.890> thicker<00:00:44.100> strands<00:00:44.460> and

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
of time I did it in thicker strands and

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.069 
of time I did it in thicker strands and
I<00:00:44.700> think<00:00:44.879> it's<00:00:44.969> also<00:00:45.180> easier<00:00:45.690> for<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:45.899> guys<00:00:45.930> to

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
I think it's also easier for you guys to

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.420 
I think it's also easier for you guys to
understand<00:00:46.559> how<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.770> do<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.039> when<00:00:47.160> I<00:00:47.190> do<00:00:47.280> it

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
understand how to do it when I do it

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.100 
understand how to do it when I do it
with<00:00:47.550> thicker<00:00:47.700> strands<00:00:48.030> where<00:00:48.270> it's<00:00:48.840> if<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:49.020> had

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
with thicker strands where it's if I had

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.090 
with thicker strands where it's if I had
done<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.230> with<00:00:49.410> small<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:49.649> think<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:49.920> would<00:00:50.010> have

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
done it with small I think it would have

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.799 
done it with small I think it would have
been<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.219> little<00:00:50.430> bit<00:00:50.610> more<00:00:50.760> complicated<00:00:51.059> but<00:00:51.539> I

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
been a little bit more complicated but I

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.959 
been a little bit more complicated but I

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
to be as I said earlier I'm doing it

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.880 
to be as I said earlier I'm doing it
thicker<00:02:48.510> so<00:02:48.750> that<00:02:48.780> you<00:02:48.990> guys<00:02:49.110> can<00:02:49.350> kind<00:02:49.709> of<00:02:49.830> see

thicker so that you guys can kind of see

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.040 
thicker so that you guys can kind of see
easier<00:02:50.400> how<00:02:50.610> it's<00:02:50.790> done<00:02:51.090> but<00:02:51.600> if<00:02:51.690> you<00:02:51.780> wanted

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
easier how it's done but if you wanted

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.360 
easier how it's done but if you wanted
to<00:02:52.200> you<00:02:52.380> could<00:02:52.500> do<00:02:52.590> thinner<00:02:52.800> strands<00:02:53.100> which<00:02:53.280> I

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
to you could do thinner strands which I

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.740 
to you could do thinner strands which I
think<00:02:53.580> are<00:02:53.670> absolutely<00:02:53.790> beautiful<00:02:54.240> but<00:02:54.630> it's

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
think are absolutely beautiful but it's

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.780 
think are absolutely beautiful but it's
a<00:02:54.810> lot<00:02:55.050> more<00:02:55.230> time-consuming<00:02:55.640> so<00:02:56.640> it's

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
a lot more time-consuming so it's

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.740 
a lot more time-consuming so it's
completely<00:02:57.180> up<00:02:57.300> to<00:02:57.330> your<00:02:57.480> own<00:02:57.570> discretion

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.179 

then<00:03:01.750> once<00:03:01.989> I<00:03:02.110> get<00:03:02.290> near<00:03:02.439> the<00:03:02.560> bottom<00:03:02.829> I<00:03:02.980> like

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:03.189 
then once I get near the bottom I like

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:05.130 
then once I get near the bottom I like
to<00:03:03.519> tie<00:03:03.849> it<00:03:03.909> off<00:03:04.060> with<00:03:04.090> my<00:03:04.299> hair<00:03:04.510> tie<00:03:04.689> I<00:03:04.900> just

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
to tie it off with my hair tie I just

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.300 
to tie it off with my hair tie I just
use<00:03:05.230> Brown<00:03:05.439> because<00:03:05.680> it<00:03:05.739> blends<00:03:05.950> in<00:03:06.069> with<00:03:06.159> my

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
use Brown because it blends in with my

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.679 
use Brown because it blends in with my
hair<00:03:06.519> and<00:03:06.730> I<00:03:06.819> like<00:03:06.939> to<00:03:07.090> leave<00:03:07.209> a<00:03:07.239> little<00:03:07.510> bit<00:03:07.599> of

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:07.689 
hair and I like to leave a little bit of

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:09.030 
hair and I like to leave a little bit of
a<00:03:07.810> section<00:03:08.140> because<00:03:08.319> I<00:03:08.379> think<00:03:08.439> it<00:03:08.680> makes<00:03:08.860> it

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
a section because I think it makes it

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.339 
a section because I think it makes it
look<00:03:09.189> more<00:03:09.370> like<00:03:09.430> a<00:03:09.640> fish<00:03:09.879> which<00:03:10.720> is<00:03:10.930> kind<00:03:11.290> of

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
look more like a fish which is kind of

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.410 
look more like a fish which is kind of
funny<00:03:11.530> but<00:03:11.769> that's<00:03:12.519> all<00:03:12.670> that<00:03:12.790> there<00:03:12.909> is<00:03:12.939> to<00:03:13.030> it

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
funny but that's all that there is to it

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.440 
funny but that's all that there is to it
and<00:03:13.569> there's<00:03:14.379> your<00:03:14.500> fishtail<00:03:14.709> braid<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:16.150> then

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
and there's your fishtail braid and then

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:17.759
