00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:06.279
 FC Köln vs. Bayer Leverkusen Bundesliga thirtieth April 2011 lower them 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:07.720
 strange you fight today 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.999
 the strange Kenzie my luck 

00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:12.869
 2 2 one for Leverkusen here is a duel 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:16.949
 That's a lot in both the top and bottom of the table 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.339
 can decide 

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:22.279
 the Cologne are after a series of bad results in 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.479
 a rather unfavorable situation while the Leverkusen still 

00:00:26.479 --> 00:00:30.919
 hope that they can win the title although the chances are not too high 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.770
 especially if they do not win today 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.910
 In the first leg in the BayArena Leverkusen has in a scorching game 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.910
 Play a 3 to 2 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.940
 30 St April April to 15 30 clock three defeats in a row 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.820
 including a home defeat were enough to make a change of coach 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.940
 so the former coach Frank Schaefer was replaced by the Volker Finke 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.670
 the Cologne are now in an unnamed they have situation 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.930
 great uncertainty 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.130
 he agrees and at the worst possible time they have to be dangerous 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.000
 Leverkusen received 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.670
 the Billy goats have very bad in the three mentioned encounters 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.460
 played but you should point out that the away defeats 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.220
 are not too big surprise 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.340
 we have already mentioned in our reports that the 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.940
 Billy goats convincingly the worst visiting team in this 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.460
 Season are 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.110
 in the distance they have this season 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.700
 Season only won once and got a meager six points 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.440
 However, they have played very well at home and two to them the Swabians 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.070
 of which they are in their own 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.260
 moderately conquering the 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.780
 just received and that happened in this 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.310
 the song again 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.940
 each of these three encounters, the Cologne have at least scored a goal 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.550
 they have even cashed twelve 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.200
 So these were the real disgrace and in duels against the teams 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.240
 who are struggling to survive and that certainly has a negative impact on the 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.549
 mental stability of the team 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:13.040
 the new coach can change something and the positive mood back into the team 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.529
 it remains to be seen 

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:20.049
 in the crew not too much changed because the Billy goats no 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.219
 have a particularly broad bank 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:28.109
 they have to change the stakes and try the security they have 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:29.099
 Much of the season 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.499
 Season in their own stadium have shown back to find 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.419
 Podolski and Petit are back and that is 

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:40.009
 Maybe the better news than the news of the change of coach 

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:46.469
 Player Brecko and the scorer of the only goal on the final day 

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:49.749
 Sebastian Freis will stay on the bench this time 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:52.120
 expected installation 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.939
 Can position 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:57.529
 André Ziel lifted Geromel Mohamad Eichner 

00:02:57.529 --> 00:02:58.909
 Lanig PEG 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.570
 Jan o I give you Podolski 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:02.760
 Novakovic g 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.579
 Leverkusen have survived the disaster in the Allianz Arena 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:10.639
 ENA quickly recovered and on the final day at home Hoffenheim 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:12.479
 defeated 

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:16.569
 they did not play on the Lido that one of a runner-up 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.379
 Team AP 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:22.969
 You can even say that the results have been much better in recent times 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:25.319
 are earned because they are in the game against 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.479
 Hoffenheim were in one to zero residue and somehow made it into 

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:30.139
 the walls 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:31.939
 To initiate games 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:35.609
 the same scenario and with the same result was 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:39.049
 also seen in the match against St Pauli two rounds ago 

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:42.469
 this shows us very well that they are a very 

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:43.890
 very experienced and mentally 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.620
 stable team because they manage to win 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.739
 even if they do not play that well 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.499
 Edison, they have nothing left to lose 

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:56.879
 You have secured yourself second place in the table 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:00.779
 by a miracle they could win the championship cup but that depends 

00:04:00.779 --> 00:04:02.609
 not just from them 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:06.540
 the Dortmund would have to help with the defeats a bit but 

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:08.929
 that's hardly to be expected 

00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:12.709
 they are thus relieved of this encounter and decide about it 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.209
 Destiny of 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.439
 they are complete and that means that the coach Heimplatz the crew 

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:20.859
 can change a little 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.469
 but only so far as one 

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:25.139
 to get a little change in the team 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.199
 it will probably be replaced by Balitsch 

00:04:28.809 --> 00:04:30.270
 expected installation 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.309
 Leverkusen 

00:04:32.309 --> 00:04:34.990
 Balitsch Schwaab sets the PEA kg 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.729
 Airbender is Sam Ballack in this Renato Augusto Kießling 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:44.099
 The guests are definitely a better quality team 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:48.780
 Game does not matter much to them especially if they are over 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:49.270
 of 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.800
 Game learn that the Dortmund are in the game against Nuremberg in the lead 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:58.819
 On the other hand, this game is crucial for the Billy Goats 

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:02.139
 and they have shown that several times this season 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:04.759
 are very unpleasant hosts 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:08.930
 if you take all of that into consideration then it's safer to look at one 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.740
 greater number of hits achieved
