alright<00:03:33.110> so<00:03:33.290> let's<00:03:33.410> go<00:03:33.560> for<00:03:33.770> a<00:03:33.830> c-sharp<00:03:34.280> sweet

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
alright so let's go for a c-sharp sweet

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:45.520 
alright so let's go for a c-sharp sweet
flavors<00:03:35.690> Missy<00:03:36.200> sharp

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.130 

let's<00:03:46.520> see<00:03:46.880> all<00:03:46.910> right<00:03:47.150> it<00:03:47.630> seems<00:03:47.870> like<00:03:48.020> the

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
let's see all right it seems like the

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.570 
let's see all right it seems like the
tones<00:03:48.350> are<00:03:48.500> close<00:03:48.650> enough<00:03:48.680> together<00:03:48.950> that<00:03:49.250> we

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
tones are close enough together that we

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.400 
tones are close enough together that we
can<00:03:51.520> multiply<00:03:52.520> this<00:03:52.880> facing<00:03:53.330> to<00:03:53.840> to<00:03:54.140> get<00:03:54.290> the

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
can multiply this facing to to get the

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.199 
can multiply this facing to to get the
tones<00:03:54.650> before<00:03:55.100> we<00:03:55.190> were<00:03:55.550> kind<00:03:55.760> of<00:03:55.790> afraid<00:03:56.030> that

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
tones before we were kind of afraid that

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:57.430 
tones before we were kind of afraid that
we<00:03:56.300> wouldn't<00:03:56.480> be<00:03:56.600> able<00:03:56.660> to<00:03:56.780> get<00:03:56.870> to<00:03:56.990> the<00:03:57.080> octave

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
we wouldn't be able to get to the octave

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.800 
we wouldn't be able to get to the octave
and<00:03:57.550> I'm<00:03:58.550> encouraged<00:03:59.030> that<00:03:59.120> we<00:03:59.270> will<00:03:59.510> be<00:03:59.660> able

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
and I'm encouraged that we will be able

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.640 
and I'm encouraged that we will be able
to<00:03:59.959> get<00:04:00.319> the<00:04:00.620> full<00:04:00.800> auxins<00:04:01.220> of<00:04:01.370> the<00:04:01.459> song
