00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.590
 what's up, people, my name is average, 

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.590
 second or better known as monkey 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:22.450
 today I write this letter for you maybe 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:25.740
 the content you have 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:28.980
 you are almost sure that after reading it 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.330
 you will break it but I still wanted to tell you 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.910
 that I'm not quite right today 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.560
 and how are you if you had already removed the 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.230
 chains that kept in my heart 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:42.460
 closed for you to spend living in 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:45.100
 him and that maybe I was the one guilty of 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.430
 my pain because I worked too much on something 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.920
 that was not happening yet 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.980
 and you know it 's something very much for me 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.010
 hard 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.590
 in spite of those who do not understand why 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.700
 I became addicted to the pain that causes me 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:03.030
 will be waiting for them to explain 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:08.300
 my feelings went to bodybuilding 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:10.190
 I was wrapped around the nation I became worse 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.770
 I am becoming something that is not 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.110
 about it a version of me that is the 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.680
 worst I would have known and the most 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.930
 surprising is that the form was not the 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.420
 to have found out in the truth of the 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.250
 way that loris was that even a 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.250
 instant before discovering it 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.320
 in cold I'll let you go there's no turning 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.030
 behind 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.729
 I wish you to be happy 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:40.240
 that I can never suffer like I am 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:43.030
 doing then I'm leaving I should raise the 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.400
 flight and find a new floor for 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.490
 to be able to land where my feet are 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:53.120
 pose now they start to burn already 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:56.690
 crumble the fire of lying 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:02:00.530
 Be as happy as you can live and love 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:04.390
 but it does not harm the man who 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.390
 look for a happiness by your side 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.109
 ah
