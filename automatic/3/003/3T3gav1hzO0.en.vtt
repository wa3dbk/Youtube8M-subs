line is shaded this is indicating which
side<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.649> curve<00:00:55.860> will<00:00:56.550> become<00:00:56.730> masked<00:00:59.059> if

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
side of the curve will become masked if

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.000 
side of the curve will become masked if
I<00:01:00.210> hold<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.539> Alt<00:01:00.750> key<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.260> curb<00:01:01.469> turns<00:01:01.739> bright

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
I hold the Alt key the curb turns bright

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.100 
I hold the Alt key the curb turns bright
white<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.910> can<00:01:02.940> see<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.300> I'm<00:01:03.420> unmasking

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
white and you can see that I'm unmasking

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.620 
white and you can see that I'm unmasking
once<00:01:04.860> again<00:01:05.220> it's<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.610> sated<00:01:06.150> side<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.570> the

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
once again it's the sated side of the

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.420 
once again it's the sated side of the
curve<00:01:06.869> this<00:01:07.049> indicates<00:01:07.470> where<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.830> masking

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
curve this indicates where the masking

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.670 
curve this indicates where the masking
or<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.729> unmasking<00:01:09.299> won't<00:01:09.540> occur<00:01:09.720> if<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.409> drag

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
or the unmasking won't occur if I drag

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.289 
or the unmasking won't occur if I drag
down<00:01:10.710> from<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.369> top<00:01:11.580> you'll<00:01:11.820> see<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.119> the

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
down from the top you'll see that the

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.030 
down from the top you'll see that the
shaded<00:01:12.720> side<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.140> on<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.320> right<00:01:13.409> side<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.979> the

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
shaded side is on the right side of the

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.800 
shaded side is on the right side of the
curve<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:14.490> everything<00:01:14.970> on<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.210> side<00:01:15.390> will

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
curve so everything on that side will

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.609 
curve so everything on that side will
become<00:01:15.960> masked

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
become masked

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.620 
become masked
if<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.159> want<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.369> mask<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.759> left<00:01:18.030> side<00:01:18.270> I'll

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
if I want to mask the left side I'll

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.539 
if I want to mask the left side I'll
simply<00:01:19.020> start<00:01:19.380> from<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.650> bottom<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.159> drag

simply start from the bottom and drag
upwards<00:01:28.729> and<00:01:29.729> actually<00:01:30.240> create<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.659> curve<00:01:31.049> you

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
upwards and actually create a curve you

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.319 
upwards and actually create a curve you
just<00:01:31.470> drag<00:01:31.979> in<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.250> surface<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.790> tap<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.119> Alt

turn white and then I'll let go and that

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:20.470 
turn white and then I'll let go and that
part<00:02:14.540> of<00:02:14.600> the<00:02:14.660> mask<00:02:14.870> will<00:02:15.080> be<00:02:15.110> erased<00:02:19.390> if<00:02:20.390> I

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
part of the mask will be erased if I

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.120 
part of the mask will be erased if I
want<00:02:20.630> to<00:02:20.750> reposition<00:02:21.080> the<00:02:21.470> masking<00:02:21.860> curve

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
want to reposition the masking curve

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.340 
want to reposition the masking curve
after<00:02:22.970> I've<00:02:23.060> drawn<00:02:23.300> it<00:02:23.480> I'll<00:02:23.810> just<00:02:23.870> hold<00:02:24.170> the

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
after I've drawn it I'll just hold the

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.470 
after I've drawn it I'll just hold the
spacebar<00:02:24.680> and<00:02:25.190> then<00:02:25.610> drag<00:02:25.820> on<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.120> surface

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
spacebar and then drag on the surface

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.790 
spacebar and then drag on the surface
and<00:02:26.780> then<00:02:26.870> I<00:02:26.960> can<00:02:27.110> position<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.650> curve

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
and then I can position the curve

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.680 
and then I can position the curve
anywhere<00:02:28.220> I<00:02:28.250> want<00:02:28.520> this<00:02:29.060> allows<00:02:29.330> for<00:02:29.360> even

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
anywhere I want this allows for even

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.630 
anywhere I want this allows for even
more<00:02:29.990> position<00:02:30.500> as<00:02:30.650> to<00:02:31.160> where<00:02:31.340> I<00:02:31.370> want<00:02:31.580> to

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
more position as to where I want to

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.960 
more position as to where I want to
place<00:02:31.820> the<00:02:32.000> masks<00:02:32.480> on<00:02:32.630> my<00:02:32.720> surface<00:02:33.910> here<00:02:34.910> you

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
place the masks on my surface here you

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.910 
place the masks on my surface here you
can<00:02:35.120> see<00:02:35.240> Geert<00:02:35.540> melis<00:02:35.930> using<00:02:36.320> this<00:02:36.440> technique

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
can see Geert melis using this technique

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.340 
can see Geert melis using this technique
in<00:02:37.100> combination<00:02:37.820> with<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.150> curve<00:02:38.480> clipping

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350

of<00:02:42.110> his<00:02:42.230> nose<00:02:50.110> I'm<00:02:51.110> adding<00:02:51.500> to<00:02:51.620> my<00:02:51.709> design<00:02:52.040> just

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
of his nose I'm adding to my design just

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.100 
of his nose I'm adding to my design just
by<00:02:52.430> creating<00:02:52.820> some<00:02:53.030> circular<00:02:53.510> masks<00:02:53.930> of<00:02:54.080> the

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
by creating some circular masks of the

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:01.390 
by creating some circular masks of the
surface<00:02:59.500> it's<00:03:00.500> not<00:03:00.680> too<00:03:00.800> hard<00:03:01.040> to<00:03:01.160> come<00:03:01.280> up

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
surface it's not too hard to come up

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.100 
surface it's not too hard to come up
with<00:03:01.550> something<00:03:01.820> very<00:03:01.850> creative<00:03:02.360> a<00:03:02.720> very

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
with something very creative a very

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.170 
with something very creative a very
short<00:03:03.380> amount<00:03:03.590> of<00:03:03.650> time<00:03:03.739> once<00:03:04.459> I<00:03:04.550> have<00:03:04.760> my<00:03:04.910> mask

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
short amount of time once I have my mask

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.030 
short amount of time once I have my mask
I<00:03:05.420> can<00:03:05.570> use<00:03:05.720> various<00:03:06.110> techniques<00:03:06.530> I<00:03:06.830> can

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
I can use various techniques I can

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.440 
I can use various techniques I can
invert<00:03:07.340> the<00:03:07.400> mask<00:03:07.730> and<00:03:08.060> do<00:03:08.180> a<00:03:08.209> negative

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
invert the mask and do a negative

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.570 
invert the mask and do a negative
inflate<00:03:08.989> or<00:03:09.290> positive<00:03:09.769> and<00:03:09.920> plate<00:03:10.130> to<00:03:10.400> push

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
inflate or positive and plate to push

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:17.309 
inflate or positive and plate to push
out<00:03:10.760> those<00:03:11.000> parts<00:03:11.360> of<00:03:11.480> the<00:03:11.540> surface

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.780 

another<00:03:18.319> classic<00:03:18.739> technique<00:03:19.099> is<00:03:19.340> to<00:03:19.640> use<00:03:19.760> a

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
another classic technique is to use a

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.900 
another classic technique is to use a
mesh<00:03:20.150> extraction<00:03:20.840> so<00:03:21.470> I've<00:03:21.650> used<00:03:21.680> the<00:03:22.220> masking

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
mesh extraction so I've used the masking

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.869 
mesh extraction so I've used the masking
curve<00:03:23.180> and<00:03:23.510> the<00:03:23.780> circular<00:03:24.230> masking<00:03:24.879> brushes

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879 
curve and the circular masking brushes

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:27.610 
curve and the circular masking brushes
to<00:03:26.120> create<00:03:26.360> a<00:03:26.390> complex<00:03:26.780> design<00:03:27.260> and<00:03:27.500> it's

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
to create a complex design and it's

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.740 
to create a complex design and it's
rounded<00:03:27.950> cube<00:03:28.310> and<00:03:29.000> now<00:03:29.120> by<00:03:29.269> pressing<00:03:29.420> the

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
rounded cube and now by pressing the

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.380 
rounded cube and now by pressing the
extract<00:03:30.170> button<00:03:30.260> I<00:03:30.739> can<00:03:31.099> create<00:03:31.459> a<00:03:31.519> mesh<00:03:31.790> from

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
extract button I can create a mesh from

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
extract button I can create a mesh from
that<00:03:32.569> mask<00:03:32.870> design<00:03:33.319> on<00:03:33.620> the<00:03:33.830> surface<00:03:35.410> using

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
that mask design on the surface using

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:37.690 
that mask design on the surface using
this<00:03:36.500> technique<00:03:36.920> you<00:03:37.069> can<00:03:37.129> come<00:03:37.280> up<00:03:37.400> with<00:03:37.549> some

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
this technique you can come up with some

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:45.060 
this technique you can come up with some
very<00:03:37.819> complex<00:03:38.330> three-dimensional<00:03:39.080> designs

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070
