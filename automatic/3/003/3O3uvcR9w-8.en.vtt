some other reviews so getting straight
into<00:00:45.080> it<00:00:45.290> initially<00:00:45.860> the<00:00:46.010> phone<00:00:46.190> actually

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
into it initially the phone actually

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.920 
into it initially the phone actually
looks<00:00:46.760> pretty<00:00:46.880> good<00:00:47.270> in<00:00:47.360> my<00:00:47.480> opinion

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
looks pretty good in my opinion

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.570 
looks pretty good in my opinion
I<00:00:48.050> like<00:00:48.410> the<00:00:48.530> curved<00:00:48.740> design<00:00:49.100> and<00:00:49.430> although

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:49.580 
I like the curved design and although

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.310 
I like the curved design and although
it's<00:00:49.820> plastic<00:00:50.300> it<00:00:50.450> doesn't<00:00:50.480> feel<00:00:50.870> cheap<00:00:50.900> in

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
it's plastic it doesn't feel cheap in

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.440 
it's plastic it doesn't feel cheap in
any<00:00:51.470> way<00:00:51.650> it's<00:00:52.190> also<00:00:52.400> comfortable<00:00:52.880> to<00:00:53.060> hold

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:53.450 
any way it's also comfortable to hold

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.880 
any way it's also comfortable to hold
I<00:00:53.510> like<00:00:53.750> the<00:00:53.870> grippy<00:00:54.140> texture<00:00:54.530> on<00:00:54.590> the<00:00:54.710> back

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
I like the grippy texture on the back

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.370 
I like the grippy texture on the back
which<00:00:55.610> can<00:00:55.940> be<00:00:56.090> customized<00:00:56.570> and<00:00:56.780> replaced<00:00:57.230> by

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:57.380 
which can be customized and replaced by

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.860 
which can be customized and replaced by
the<00:00:57.440> way<00:00:57.710> as<00:00:57.980> can<00:00:58.490> the<00:00:58.610> metal<00:00:58.910> accident<00:00:59.450> which

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
the way as can the metal accident which

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.710 
the way as can the metal accident which
has<00:01:00.200> the<00:01:00.440> signature<00:01:00.860> Motorola<00:01:01.430> dimple<00:01:01.910> the

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:02.720 
has the signature Motorola dimple the

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.740 
has the signature Motorola dimple the
phone<00:01:02.930> is<00:01:03.080> also<00:01:03.460> ipx7<00:01:04.600> water-resistant<00:01:05.600> which

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
phone is also ipx7 water-resistant which

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.210 
phone is also ipx7 water-resistant which
means<00:01:05.990> you<00:01:06.080> can<00:01:06.229> fully<00:01:06.409> submerge<00:01:06.860> it<00:01:07.040> into

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
means you can fully submerge it into

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.490 
means you can fully submerge it into
water<00:01:07.490> up<00:01:07.850> to<00:01:07.880> 1<00:01:08.180> meter<00:01:08.390> for<00:01:08.690> 30<00:01:08.870> minutes<00:01:09.260> which

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
water up to 1 meter for 30 minutes which

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.050 
water up to 1 meter for 30 minutes which
is<00:01:09.530> a<00:01:09.650> great<00:01:09.890> thing<00:01:09.920> to<00:01:10.160> have<00:01:10.340> and<00:01:10.520> I<00:01:10.580> wish<00:01:10.820> all

around 294 ppi pixel density it's a

display myself I did obviously notice a
step<00:01:44.600> down<00:01:44.870> but<00:01:45.200> it's<00:01:45.320> perfectly<00:01:45.740> usable<00:01:46.130> and

didn't<00:01:57.229> get<00:01:57.350> me<00:01:57.500> six<00:01:57.830> hours<00:01:57.950> on<00:01:58.220> screen<00:01:58.490> time

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
didn't get me six hours on screen time

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.120 
didn't get me six hours on screen time
like<00:01:59.090> some<00:01:59.299> of<00:01:59.450> the<00:01:59.510> youtubers<00:02:00.080> I<00:02:00.320> was<00:02:00.830> hitting

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
like some of the youtubers I was hitting

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.010 
like some of the youtubers I was hitting
more<00:02:01.369> in<00:02:01.460> the<00:02:01.549> range<00:02:01.729> of<00:02:01.909> four<00:02:02.270> to<00:02:02.420> five<00:02:02.600> hours

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
more in the range of four to five hours

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.840 
more in the range of four to five hours
but<00:02:03.229> I<00:02:03.260> really<00:02:03.650> don't<00:02:03.770> think<00:02:04.100> most<00:02:04.280> users<00:02:04.700> will

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
but I really don't think most users will

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:05.920 
but I really don't think most users will
have<00:02:05.000> a<00:02:05.030> problem<00:02:05.360> getting<00:02:05.510> through<00:02:05.690> the<00:02:05.810> day

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930

on<00:02:05.960> this<00:02:06.229> one<00:02:06.530> thing<00:02:06.740> I<00:02:06.920> do<00:02:06.979> wish<00:02:07.400> this<00:02:07.580> had<00:02:07.880> is

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
on this one thing I do wish this had is

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.330 
on this one thing I do wish this had is
fast<00:02:08.569> charging<00:02:08.989> not<00:02:09.200> a<00:02:09.229> big<00:02:09.440> deal<00:02:09.679> if<00:02:09.890> you<00:02:10.310> are

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
fast charging not a big deal if you are

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.949 
fast charging not a big deal if you are
just<00:02:10.729> trying<00:02:10.849> to<00:02:10.940> go<00:02:11.090> overnight<00:02:11.360> for<00:02:11.540> example

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
just trying to go overnight for example

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.019 
just trying to go overnight for example
but<00:02:12.409> it<00:02:12.499> would<00:02:12.620> have<00:02:12.709> been<00:02:12.769> nice<00:02:13.040> to<00:02:13.069> have<00:02:13.340> now

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:14.029 
but it would have been nice to have now

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:15.610 
but it would have been nice to have now
before<00:02:14.359> we<00:02:14.480> move<00:02:14.870> on<00:02:15.049> to<00:02:15.079> the<00:02:15.290> speed<00:02:15.499> and

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
before we move on to the speed and

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.059 
before we move on to the speed and
performance<00:02:15.709> I<00:02:16.279> have<00:02:16.430> to<00:02:16.549> mention<00:02:16.730> that

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
performance I have to mention that

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.099 
performance I have to mention that
there<00:02:17.189> are<00:02:17.340> two<00:02:17.579> versions<00:02:17.819> available<00:02:18.180> of<00:02:18.719> this

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:19.109 
there are two versions available of this

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:21.500 
there are two versions available of this
one<00:02:19.590> with<00:02:19.769> 8<00:02:20.010> gigabytes<00:02:20.430> of<00:02:20.549> storage<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:21.120> 1

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
one with 8 gigabytes of storage and 1

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.660 
one with 8 gigabytes of storage and 1
gigabyte<00:02:21.900> of<00:02:21.959> RAM<00:02:22.409> or<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.829> other<00:02:22.950> with<00:02:23.219> 16

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
gigabyte of RAM or the other with 16

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.699 
gigabyte of RAM or the other with 16
gigabytes<00:02:23.879> of<00:02:24.180> storage<00:02:24.299> and<00:02:24.719> 2<00:02:25.170> gigabytes<00:02:25.590> of

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
gigabytes of storage and 2 gigabytes of

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.830 
gigabytes of storage and 2 gigabytes of
RAM<00:02:25.889> so<00:02:26.310> obviously<00:02:26.819> performance<00:02:27.180> will<00:02:27.569> differ

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
RAM so obviously performance will differ

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.869 
RAM so obviously performance will differ
even<00:02:28.170> if<00:02:28.469> only<00:02:28.859> slightly<00:02:29.159> between<00:02:29.579> the<00:02:29.700> two

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
even if only slightly between the two

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.119
