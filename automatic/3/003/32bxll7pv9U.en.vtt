there Delrin they're machined and what
it<00:01:45.690> does<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:46.050> it<00:01:46.170> takes<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.710> filament<00:01:48.650> from

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
it does is it takes the filament from

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.109 
it does is it takes the filament from

about<00:01:59.130> ten<00:01:59.399> windings<00:01:59.880> per<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.600> these<00:02:01.170> are

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
about ten windings per and these are

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:04.010 
about ten windings per and these are
grooved<00:02:01.700> so<00:02:02.700> they<00:02:02.820> grit<00:02:03.119> grip<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.630> filament

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
grooved so they grit grip the filament

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.340 
grooved so they grit grip the filament
very<00:02:04.229> nicely<00:02:05.149> come<00:02:06.149> past<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:07.530> bed<00:02:08.009> stand<00:02:08.580> here

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
very nicely come past the bed stand here

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.920 
very nicely come past the bed stand here
you<00:02:10.350> turn<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.649> corner<00:02:10.800> go<00:02:11.100> up<00:02:11.280> inside<00:02:11.870> one<00:02:12.870> of

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
you turn the corner go up inside one of

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.570 
you turn the corner go up inside one of
them<00:02:13.140> goes<00:02:13.350> past<00:02:13.850> the<00:02:14.850> carriage<00:02:15.180> up<00:02:16.280> past<00:02:17.280> all

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
them goes past the carriage up past all

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.430 
them goes past the carriage up past all
of<00:02:17.700> this

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
of this

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.759 
of this
another<00:02:19.440> idler<00:02:19.890> up<00:02:20.250> here<00:02:20.489> at<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.670> top

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
another idler up here at the top

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.160 
another idler up here at the top
basically<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:24.120> filament<00:02:24.450> passes<00:02:24.750> around<00:02:24.900> the

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
basically the filament passes around the

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.710 
basically the filament passes around the
top<00:02:25.380> and<00:02:26.010> this<00:02:26.280> is<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.519> adjuster<00:02:27.030> so<00:02:27.450> this<00:02:27.600> is

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
top and this is the adjuster so this is

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.240 
top and this is the adjuster so this is
the<00:02:27.840> tension<00:02:28.050> adjuster<00:02:28.590> for<00:02:28.769> the<00:02:28.830> filament

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
the tension adjuster for the filament

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.250 
the tension adjuster for the filament
you<00:02:29.310> push<00:02:29.489> up<00:02:29.670> you<00:02:30.390> tighten<00:02:30.570> the<00:02:30.780> bolt<00:02:30.989> on<00:02:31.170> the

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
you push up you tighten the bolt on the

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.890 
you push up you tighten the bolt on the
top<00:02:31.700> that<00:02:32.700> basically<00:02:33.180> pulls<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.570> filament

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
top that basically pulls the filament

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.000 
top that basically pulls the filament
tight<00:02:34.019> because<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.290> filament<00:02:34.650> winds<00:02:34.920> around

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
tight because the filament winds around

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.330 
tight because the filament winds around
and<00:02:35.549> comes<00:02:36.150> back<00:02:36.390> down<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:37.100> it<00:02:38.100> attaches

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
and comes back down and it attaches

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.100 
and comes back down and it attaches
inside

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.770 

speaking<00:02:42.950> focus<00:02:43.250> that<00:02:43.400> in<00:02:43.550> there

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:50.930 
directly in line with the centerline of
this<00:02:50.400> in<00:02:50.580> here

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
this in here

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.540 
this in here
so<00:02:51.510> both<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.930> filaments<00:02:52.410> top<00:02:52.710> and<00:02:52.920> bottom<00:02:53.220> are

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
so both the filaments top and bottom are

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.040 
so both the filaments top and bottom are
attached<00:02:53.910> right<00:02:54.150> at<00:02:54.300> that<00:02:54.420> center<00:02:54.660> point<00:02:54.840> with

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
attached right at that center point with

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.160 
attached right at that center point with
a<00:02:55.080> bolt<00:02:55.640> so<00:02:56.640> in<00:02:57.180> case<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.630> other<00:02:57.720> side<00:02:57.990> is

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
a bolt so in case the other side is

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.370 
a bolt so in case the other side is
attached<00:02:58.470> below<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.340> it<00:02:59.940> travels<00:03:00.300> down<00:03:00.510> and

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
attached below and it travels down and

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.810 
attached below and it travels down and
it<00:03:01.500> makes<00:03:02.040> up<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.220> other<00:03:02.340> side<00:03:02.640> of<00:03:02.760> the

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
it makes up the other side of the

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.360 
it makes up the other side of the
winding<00:03:03.209> so<00:03:03.720> as<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:04.140> as<00:03:04.320> the<00:03:04.620> motor<00:03:04.950> spins

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
winding so as the as the motor spins

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.340 
winding so as the as the motor spins
it's<00:03:06.000> basically<00:03:06.420> pulling<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.930> carriage<00:03:07.200> up

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
it's basically pulling the carriage up

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.160 
it's basically pulling the carriage up
and<00:03:07.530> down<00:03:07.700> on<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.730> extrusion<00:03:09.330> it's<00:03:09.900> very

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
and down on the extrusion it's very

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.449 
and down on the extrusion it's very
smooth<00:03:10.530> very<00:03:10.770> quiet<00:03:11.930> and<00:03:12.930> actually<00:03:13.290> very<00:03:13.459> very

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
smooth very quiet and actually very very

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.470 
smooth very quiet and actually very very
sturdy<00:03:14.910> so<00:03:15.709> it's<00:03:16.910> working<00:03:17.910> out<00:03:17.970> much<00:03:18.209> better

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
sturdy so it's working out much better

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.080 
sturdy so it's working out much better
than<00:03:18.660> I<00:03:18.750> had<00:03:18.840> anticipated

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
than I had anticipated

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.850 
than I had anticipated
we've<00:03:21.090> got<00:03:21.330> just<00:03:21.989> standard<00:03:22.650> Traxxas<00:03:24.110> 37<00:03:25.110> 45<00:03:25.620> so

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
we've got just standard Traxxas 37 45 so

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.220 
we've got just standard Traxxas 37 45 so
I<00:03:25.920> think<00:03:25.980> memory<00:03:26.610> serves<00:03:26.850> me<00:03:27.000> correctly<00:03:27.420> here

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
I think memory serves me correctly here

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.560 
I think memory serves me correctly here
these<00:03:28.320> are<00:03:28.470> just<00:03:28.530> RC<00:03:29.130> car<00:03:29.370> parts<00:03:29.700> and<00:03:29.850> these

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
these are just RC car parts and these

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.100 
these are just RC car parts and these
are<00:03:30.750> bonded<00:03:31.170> to<00:03:31.680> this<00:03:31.770> aluminum<00:03:32.280> rod<00:03:32.489> here

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
are bonded to this aluminum rod here

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.770 
are bonded to this aluminum rod here
with<00:03:34.110> some<00:03:34.580> two-part<00:03:35.580> epoxy<00:03:35.670> some<00:03:36.239> quick<00:03:36.570> set

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
with some two-part epoxy some quick set

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.770 
with some two-part epoxy some quick set
epoxy<00:03:39.320> let's<00:03:40.320> see<00:03:41.090> okay<00:03:42.090> let's<00:03:42.420> look<00:03:42.570> at<00:03:42.660> the

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
epoxy let's see okay let's look at the

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.810 
epoxy let's see okay let's look at the
base<00:03:42.959> here<00:03:43.290> so<00:03:43.470> at<00:03:44.130> the<00:03:44.220> bottom<00:03:44.370> of<00:03:44.670> each<00:03:44.760> of

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
base here so at the bottom of each of

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.759 
base here so at the bottom of each of
these<00:03:45.060> extrusions<00:03:45.720> this<00:03:45.870> is<00:03:47.090> 1515<00:03:48.090> light<00:03:48.769> by

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
these extrusions this is 1515 light by

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.759 
these extrusions this is 1515 light by
80/20<00:03:50.459> that's<00:03:51.209> the<00:03:51.450> name<00:03:51.600> of<00:03:51.630> the<00:03:51.840> company<00:03:52.049> and

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
80/20 that's the name of the company and

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.550 
80/20 that's the name of the company and
in<00:03:53.280> order<00:03:53.489> to<00:03:53.640> keep<00:03:53.820> them<00:03:54.090> perfectly<00:03:54.930> parallel

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
in order to keep them perfectly parallel

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.080 
in order to keep them perfectly parallel
to<00:03:55.920> each<00:03:56.010> other<00:03:56.130> and<00:03:56.250> vertical<00:03:56.730> I<00:03:56.790> made<00:03:56.970> these

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
to each other and vertical I made these

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.660 
to each other and vertical I made these
little<00:03:57.239> these<00:03:58.140> little<00:03:58.380> pockets<00:03:59.130> basically

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
little these little pockets basically

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.789 
little these little pockets basically
they<00:03:59.820> sit<00:04:00.030> flat<00:04:00.269> inside<00:04:00.600> there<00:04:00.840> and<00:04:00.989> then<00:04:01.049> this

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
they sit flat inside there and then this

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.660 
they sit flat inside there and then this
bar<00:04:02.100> slips<00:04:03.320> slips<00:04:04.320> actually<00:04:04.709> inside<00:04:05.340> the

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
bar slips slips actually inside the

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.340 
bar slips slips actually inside the
plastic<00:04:06.299> so<00:04:06.480> there's<00:04:06.630> actually<00:04:06.750> a<00:04:06.959> pocket

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
plastic so there's actually a pocket

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.530 
plastic so there's actually a pocket
that<00:04:07.500> goes<00:04:07.530> all<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.340> way<00:04:08.519> back<00:04:08.610> almost<00:04:09.239> all

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
that goes all the way back almost all

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.449 
that goes all the way back almost all
the<00:04:09.630> way<00:04:09.720> to<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:10.019> back<00:04:10.170> here<00:04:10.500> and<00:04:10.709> then<00:04:11.280> it's

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
the way to the back here and then it's

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.650 
the way to the back here and then it's
held<00:04:11.670> in<00:04:12.170> on<00:04:13.170> either<00:04:13.380> side<00:04:13.739> top<00:04:14.640> and<00:04:14.670> bottom<00:04:15.180> so

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
held in on either side top and bottom so

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.960 
held in on either side top and bottom so
it<00:04:15.780> guides<00:04:16.320> it<00:04:16.500> at<00:04:16.590> a<00:04:16.680> 60<00:04:16.979> degree<00:04:17.100> angle<00:04:17.280> over

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
it guides it at a 60 degree angle over

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.130 
it guides it at a 60 degree angle over
to<00:04:18.299> this<00:04:18.419> other<00:04:18.540> side<00:04:20.209> right<00:04:21.209> there<00:04:21.479> and<00:04:21.660> then

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
to this other side right there and then

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.210 
to this other side right there and then
the<00:04:22.229> whole<00:04:22.380> thing<00:04:22.410> is<00:04:22.710> held<00:04:22.890> together<00:04:23.010> with

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
the whole thing is held together with

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.760 
the whole thing is held together with
these<00:04:23.460> screws<00:04:23.760> now<00:04:23.970> those<00:04:24.120> screws<00:04:24.770> actually

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
these screws now those screws actually

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.000 
these screws now those screws actually
go<00:04:26.430> right<00:04:26.729> past<00:04:26.760> the<00:04:27.600> extrusion<00:04:28.020> so<00:04:28.470> and<00:04:28.770> the

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
go right past the extrusion so and the

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.860 
go right past the extrusion so and the
threads<00:04:29.490> just<00:04:29.610> engage<00:04:30.120> the<00:04:30.360> edge<00:04:30.510> of<00:04:30.780> the

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
threads just engage the edge of the

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.870 
threads just engage the edge of the
extrusion<00:04:31.200> right<00:04:31.470> here<00:04:31.680> so<00:04:32.280> once<00:04:32.580> you<00:04:32.700> put

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
extrusion right here so once you put

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.190 
extrusion right here so once you put
that<00:04:32.910> in<00:04:33.120> and<00:04:33.240> you<00:04:33.300> put<00:04:33.450> the<00:04:33.570> screw<00:04:33.870> through<00:04:34.110> it

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
that in and you put the screw through it

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.650 
that in and you put the screw through it
attaches<00:04:34.680> this<00:04:34.860> to<00:04:35.190> this<00:04:35.340> but<00:04:35.970> it<00:04:36.060> also<00:04:36.240> ties

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
attaches this to this but it also ties

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.900 
attaches this to this but it also ties
it<00:04:36.870> and<00:04:36.990> holds<00:04:37.260> it<00:04:37.350> onto<00:04:38.070> this<00:04:38.340> so<00:04:38.550> this<00:04:38.700> won't

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
it and holds it onto this so this won't

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.200 
it and holds it onto this so this won't
move<00:04:39.150> around<00:04:39.450> so<00:04:40.140> there's<00:04:40.290> actually<00:04:40.470> no<00:04:40.680> need

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
move around so there's actually no need

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.670 
move around so there's actually no need
to<00:04:42.210> put<00:04:42.360> in<00:04:42.450> the<00:04:42.540> four<00:04:42.780> bolts<00:04:42.990> that<00:04:43.169> I<00:04:43.290> had<00:04:43.500> at

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
to put in the four bolts that I had at

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.920 
to put in the four bolts that I had at
the<00:04:43.710> front<00:04:44.010> I<00:04:44.100> kind<00:04:44.310> of<00:04:44.370> redesigned<00:04:44.790> that<00:04:44.970> to

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
the front I kind of redesigned that to

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.450 
the front I kind of redesigned that to
make<00:04:46.080> it<00:04:46.169> even<00:04:46.290> easier<00:04:48.500> let's<00:04:49.500> see<00:04:49.740> yeah<00:04:50.160> my

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
make it even easier let's see yeah my

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.190 
make it even easier let's see yeah my
new<00:04:50.610> my<00:04:50.880> new<00:04:51.000> files<00:04:51.330> actually<00:04:51.630> these<00:04:51.900> pieces

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
new my new files actually these pieces

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.570 
new my new files actually these pieces
are<00:04:52.470> all<00:04:52.800> better<00:04:53.070> than<00:04:53.160> when<00:04:53.310> I<00:04:53.340> have<00:04:53.460> to

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
are all better than when I have to

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.300 
are all better than when I have to
reprint<00:04:53.910> them<00:04:54.349> my<00:04:55.349> new<00:04:55.500> piece<00:04:55.740> is<00:04:55.950> actually

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
reprint them my new piece is actually

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.110 
reprint them my new piece is actually
dropped<00:04:56.610> down<00:04:56.820> and<00:04:57.030> this<00:04:57.120> then<00:04:57.570> becomes<00:04:58.080> the

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
dropped down and this then becomes the

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.910 
dropped down and this then becomes the
the<00:05:00.480> mount<00:05:00.690> for<00:05:01.140> the<00:05:01.230> top<00:05:01.410> of<00:05:01.440> this<00:05:01.710> so

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920 
the mount for the top of this so

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.640 
the mount for the top of this so
everything<00:05:02.160> is<00:05:02.490> basically<00:05:03.290> parallel<00:05:04.290> to<00:05:04.500> it

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
everything is basically parallel to it

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.100 
everything is basically parallel to it
to<00:05:04.950> itself<00:05:05.280> and<00:05:05.550> registered<00:05:06.480> off<00:05:06.600> the<00:05:06.750> top<00:05:06.960> of

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
to itself and registered off the top of

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.180 
to itself and registered off the top of
these<00:05:07.580> on<00:05:08.580> all<00:05:08.820> three<00:05:09.060> sides<00:05:09.740> these<00:05:10.740> are<00:05:10.980> being

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
these on all three sides these are being

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.940 
these on all three sides these are being
reprinted<00:05:11.550> this<00:05:11.850> those<00:05:12.270> did<00:05:12.420> not<00:05:12.450> work<00:05:12.840> I<00:05:13.140> just

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
reprinted this those did not work I just

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.260 
reprinted this those did not work I just
mean<00:05:14.070> it<00:05:14.160> to<00:05:14.220> make<00:05:14.340> the<00:05:14.460> hole<00:05:14.610> a<00:05:14.640> little<00:05:14.820> larger

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
mean it to make the hole a little larger

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.670 
mean it to make the hole a little larger
my<00:05:15.720> screw<00:05:16.050> broke<00:05:16.290> through<00:05:18.140> let's<00:05:19.140> see<00:05:19.290> okay<00:05:19.530> at

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
my screw broke through let's see okay at

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.190 
my screw broke through let's see okay at
the<00:05:19.770> top<00:05:22.370> here<00:05:23.370> yeah<00:05:23.700> this<00:05:23.940> piece<00:05:24.270> is<00:05:24.510> also<00:05:24.930> a

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
the top here yeah this piece is also a

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.500 
the top here yeah this piece is also a
slip<00:05:25.950> piece<00:05:26.370> that<00:05:26.550> just<00:05:26.580> fits<00:05:26.970> in<00:05:27.150> through<00:05:27.390> the

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
slip piece that just fits in through the

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:32.690 
slip piece that just fits in through the
top<00:05:27.690> there<00:05:30.290> those<00:05:31.290> need<00:05:31.470> to<00:05:31.500> be<00:05:31.590> there<00:05:31.830> and<00:05:32.190> my

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
top there those need to be there and my

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.700 
top there those need to be there and my
new<00:05:32.880> piece<00:05:33.270> here<00:05:33.780> I<00:05:33.990> didn't<00:05:34.230> reprint<00:05:34.560> these

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
new piece here I didn't reprint these

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.710 
new piece here I didn't reprint these
either<00:05:34.890> but<00:05:35.190> the<00:05:35.280> new<00:05:35.400> piece<00:05:35.640> actually<00:05:36.060> slips

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
either but the new piece actually slips

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.410 
either but the new piece actually slips
inside<00:05:37.250> inside<00:05:38.250> of<00:05:38.370> this<00:05:38.460> area<00:05:38.700> here<00:05:39.150> so<00:05:39.210> at

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:39.420 
inside inside of this area here so at

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.230 
inside inside of this area here so at
all<00:05:39.570> it<00:05:39.900> all<00:05:39.990> kind<00:05:40.230> of<00:05:40.290> joins<00:05:40.560> together<00:05:40.800> and

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
all it all kind of joins together and

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.410 
all it all kind of joins together and
then<00:05:42.240> the<00:05:42.630> the<00:05:43.080> end<00:05:43.230> stop<00:05:43.590> is<00:05:44.060> just<00:05:45.060> bolted

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:45.420 
then the the end stop is just bolted

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.080 
then the the end stop is just bolted
directly<00:05:45.570> onto<00:05:46.050> the<00:05:46.290> face<00:05:46.530> of<00:05:46.980> that<00:05:47.850> right

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
directly onto the face of that right

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.730 
directly onto the face of that right
there<00:05:48.330> as<00:05:48.450> well<00:05:48.630> so<00:05:48.810> these<00:05:48.930> this<00:05:49.290> is<00:05:49.440> actually

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
there as well so these this is actually

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.220 
there as well so these this is actually
a<00:05:49.800> real<00:05:50.010> early<00:05:50.370> prototype<00:05:50.850> but<00:05:51.840> it<00:05:51.990> didn't

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:52.230 
a real early prototype but it didn't

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:54.370 
a real early prototype but it didn't
make<00:05:52.290> sense<00:05:52.530> to<00:05:52.650> throw<00:05:53.460> it<00:05:53.610> out<00:05:53.700> because<00:05:53.910> it

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.380 
make sense to throw it out because it

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.260 
make sense to throw it out because it
worked<00:05:55.380> exactly<00:05:55.590> the<00:05:55.950> same<00:05:56.220> as<00:05:56.430> the<00:05:56.580> one<00:05:56.730> that

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
worked exactly the same as the one that

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.650 
worked exactly the same as the one that
I<00:05:57.330> have<00:05:57.480> the<00:05:57.680> STL<00:05:58.680> files<00:05:58.950> available<00:05:59.550> on<00:05:59.700> my

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 
after that house spelled out for a

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.870 
after that house spelled out for a
second<00:06:15.510> and<00:06:15.800> so<00:06:16.800> this<00:06:17.190> is<00:06:17.400> what<00:06:17.550> I<00:06:17.580> just

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 
second and so this is what I just

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.870 
second and so this is what I just
printed<00:06:18.270> this<00:06:18.690> is<00:06:19.250> did<00:06:20.250> not<00:06:20.490> turn<00:06:20.700> out<00:06:20.850> that

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 
printed this is did not turn out that

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.960 
printed this is did not turn out that
great<00:06:22.220> especially<00:06:23.220> those<00:06:23.370> toppling<00:06:23.820> well

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:23.970 
great especially those toppling well

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:29.210 
great especially those toppling well
actually<00:06:24.240> you<00:06:24.450> know<00:06:24.540> what<00:06:25.669> so<00:06:26.669> bad<00:06:27.950> top<00:06:28.950> layers

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:29.220 
actually you know what so bad top layers

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:30.380 
actually you know what so bad top layers
didn't<00:06:29.550> quite<00:06:29.730> turn<00:06:29.850> out<00:06:29.940> right<00:06:30.120> this<00:06:30.210> isn't

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:30.390 
didn't quite turn out right this isn't

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.860 
didn't quite turn out right this isn't
one<00:06:30.600> of<00:06:30.690> us<00:06:30.780> this<00:06:31.080> is<00:06:31.140> the<00:06:31.290> second<00:06:31.650> print<00:06:32.870> since

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:33.870 
one of us this is the second print since

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.480 
one of us this is the second print since
I've<00:06:34.080> got<00:06:34.260> the<00:06:34.440> system<00:06:34.830> up<00:06:34.950> and<00:06:35.040> running<00:06:35.130> here

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490 
I've got the system up and running here

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.520 
I've got the system up and running here
so<00:06:35.640> I<00:06:35.669> haven't<00:06:35.850> quite<00:06:36.120> made<00:06:36.360> my<00:06:37.140> configuration

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:37.530 
so I haven't quite made my configuration

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.580 
so I haven't quite made my configuration
file<00:06:38.840> let's<00:06:39.840> see<00:06:40.050> if<00:06:40.110> there's<00:06:40.260> a<00:06:40.350> pull-off

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:40.590 
file let's see if there's a pull-off

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:54.769 
file let's see if there's a pull-off
there

00:06:54.769 --> 00:06:54.779 

00:06:54.779 --> 00:06:58.230 

that<00:06:55.379> doesn't<00:06:55.559> look<00:06:55.619> too<00:06:55.799> bad

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.480 

so<00:06:58.930> that's<00:06:59.199> point<00:06:59.530> one<00:06:59.740> millimetre<00:07:00.190> layer

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:00.490 
so that's point one millimetre layer

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:05.689 
so that's point one millimetre layer
height<00:07:02.190> and<00:07:03.190> with<00:07:03.340> a<00:07:03.370> point<00:07:03.699> four<00:07:04.000> millimeter

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:05.699 
height and with a point four millimeter

00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:09.659 
height and with a point four millimeter
extruder<00:07:06.699> J<00:07:07.150> hot<00:07:07.599> end<00:07:08.220> extruder<00:07:09.220> and<00:07:09.310> it

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:09.669 
extruder J hot end extruder and it

00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:12.990 
extruder J hot end extruder and it
doesn't<00:07:10.210> have<00:07:10.330> the<00:07:10.660> settings<00:07:11.550> set<00:07:12.550> properly

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:13.000 
doesn't have the settings set properly

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.439 
doesn't have the settings set properly
at<00:07:13.150> this<00:07:13.270> point<00:07:14.069> but<00:07:15.069> there<00:07:15.310> you<00:07:15.400> have<00:07:15.580> it<00:07:15.729> that

00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:16.449 
at this point but there you have it that

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:21.719 
at this point but there you have it that
is<00:07:16.479> service<00:07:18.210> working<00:07:19.830> and<00:07:20.830> that's<00:07:21.400> the

00:07:21.719 --> 00:07:21.729 
is service working and that's the

00:07:21.729 --> 00:07:25.159 
is service working and that's the
machine<00:07:22.060> right<00:07:22.240> there<00:07:22.349> 24<00:07:23.349> inch<00:07:23.530> print<00:07:23.919> height

00:07:25.159 --> 00:07:25.169
