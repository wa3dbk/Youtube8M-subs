heavy<00:00:49.280> but<00:00:50.280> they<00:00:50.399> were<00:00:50.460> more<00:00:50.700> than<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:50.969> needed

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
heavy but they were more than I needed

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.180

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.299 
for the small box as I was putting
together<00:00:55.850> so<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:57.149> picked<00:00:57.570> these<00:00:57.719> up<00:00:58.309> very

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
together so I picked these up very

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.509 
together so I picked these up very
simple<00:01:01.219> they<00:01:02.219> have<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.510> trigger<00:01:04.159> that<00:01:05.159> draw

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
simple they have a trigger that draw

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.300 
simple they have a trigger that draw
some<00:01:05.790> close<00:01:06.439> and<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.560> have<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.770> little<00:01:08.010> push

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
some close and you have a little push

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.520 
some close and you have a little push
piece<00:01:08.580> back<00:01:08.820> here<00:01:09.740> that<00:01:10.740> opens<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.159> back<00:01:11.310> up<00:01:12.530> so

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
piece back here that opens it back up so

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.080 
piece back here that opens it back up so
he's<00:01:13.680> got<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.890> fair<00:01:14.159> amount<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.490> strength<00:01:14.820> I've

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
he's got a fair amount of strength I've

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.899 
he's got a fair amount of strength I've
been<00:01:15.299> warmed<00:01:16.130> by<00:01:18.229> family<00:01:19.229> member<00:01:19.560> not<00:01:20.549> to

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
been warmed by family member not to

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.200 
been warmed by family member not to
clamp<00:01:21.900> them<00:01:22.049> too<00:01:22.290> tight<00:01:22.790> because<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:24.060> can

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
clamp them too tight because you can

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.109 
clamp them too tight because you can
actually<00:01:24.390> strip<00:01:24.810> them<00:01:24.960> out<00:01:25.140> but<00:01:25.880> that's<00:01:26.880> not

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
actually strip them out but that's not

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.670

then<00:02:19.730> again<00:02:20.739> you<00:02:21.739> just<00:02:22.010> crank<00:02:23.000> it<00:02:23.120> closed<00:02:23.420> I

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
then again you just crank it closed I

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.750 
then again you just crank it closed I
only<00:02:25.459> use<00:02:25.700> these<00:02:25.879> ones<00:02:26.120> so<00:02:26.299> far<00:02:26.420> but<00:02:27.760> again

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
only use these ones so far but again

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.520 
only use these ones so far but again
it's<00:02:29.329> the<00:02:29.540> sliding<00:02:29.930> type<00:02:30.139> as<00:02:30.349> they're

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
it's the sliding type as they're

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.520 
it's the sliding type as they're
ratcheting<00:02:31.129> this<00:02:31.280> is<00:02:31.430> a<00:02:31.459> smooth<00:02:31.819> bar<00:02:32.469> so<00:02:33.469> you

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
ratcheting this is a smooth bar so you

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.199 
ratcheting this is a smooth bar so you
would<00:02:33.950> want<00:02:34.159> to<00:02:34.280> put<00:02:34.700> it<00:02:34.790> down<00:02:34.939> real<00:02:35.180> tight

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
would want to put it down real tight

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.720 
would want to put it down real tight
you'll<00:02:35.599> probably<00:02:35.780> break<00:02:36.049> it<00:02:36.519> but<00:02:37.519> it's

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
you'll probably break it but it's

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.629 
you'll probably break it but it's
inexpensive<00:02:38.420> and<00:02:38.840> good<00:02:38.989> for<00:02:39.170> small<00:02:39.379> parts<00:02:39.769> and

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:40.639 
inexpensive and good for small parts and

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:45.610 
inexpensive and good for small parts and
then<00:02:41.329> I<00:02:41.510> leave<00:02:41.689> that<00:02:43.359> because<00:02:44.359> this<00:02:45.049> proved<00:02:45.500> to

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
then I leave that because this proved to

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.670 
then I leave that because this proved to
be<00:02:45.709> just<00:02:46.419> a<00:02:48.250> little<00:02:49.250> too<00:02:49.939> short<00:02:49.970> for<00:02:50.680> something

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
be just a little too short for something

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.280 
be just a little too short for something
almost<00:02:51.829> want<00:02:52.099> to<00:02:52.159> clamp<00:02:52.780> so<00:02:53.780> I<00:02:53.840> went<00:02:54.019> to<00:02:54.139> get

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
almost want to clamp so I went to get

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.509 
almost want to clamp so I went to get
another<00:02:54.560> one<00:02:55.599> and<00:02:56.599> I<00:02:57.169> should<00:02:57.409> have<00:02:57.560> maybe<00:02:58.280> took

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
another one and I should have maybe took

00:02:58.519 --> 00:02:59.740 
another one and I should have maybe took
this<00:02:58.700> with<00:02:58.939> me<00:02:59.120> as<00:02:59.180> a<00:02:59.299> size<00:02:59.510> comparison

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
this with me as a size comparison

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.149 
this with me as a size comparison
because<00:03:00.409> I<00:03:00.500> got<00:03:00.769> a<00:03:01.180> bigger<00:03:02.180> one<00:03:02.980> it<00:03:03.980> really

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:04.159 
because I got a bigger one it really

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:05.470 
because I got a bigger one it really
didn't<00:03:04.579> mean<00:03:04.669> to<00:03:04.760> get<00:03:04.879> one<00:03:05.060> this<00:03:05.239> big

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
didn't mean to get one this big

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.089 
didn't mean to get one this big
especially<00:03:05.780> since<00:03:06.230> I<00:03:06.379> have<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:07.700> other<00:03:09.069> solid

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
especially since I have the other solid

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:16.750 
especially since I have the other solid
well<00:03:10.340> that's<00:03:10.730> solid<00:03:11.120> metal<00:03:11.389> but<00:03:15.579> this<00:03:16.579> is

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
well that's solid metal but this is

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.219 
well that's solid metal but this is
actually<00:03:17.180> slightly<00:03:17.389> longer<00:03:17.810> than<00:03:17.930> what<00:03:18.199> a

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:18.229 
actually slightly longer than what a

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:22.960 
actually slightly longer than what a
hand<00:03:20.079> but<00:03:21.079> I've<00:03:21.199> already<00:03:21.440> bought<00:03:21.620> it<00:03:21.970> again

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
hand but I've already bought it again

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:33.819 
hand but I've already bought it again
it's<00:03:23.359> the<00:03:23.599> trigger<00:03:23.840> style<00:03:24.760> so<00:03:25.760> you<00:03:26.540> just<00:03:32.829> want

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
it's the trigger style so you just want

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:37.349 
it's the trigger style so you just want
the<00:03:33.979> trigger<00:03:34.250> to<00:03:34.400> plays<00:03:34.579> in<00:03:34.819> all<00:03:34.849> things<00:03:35.209> I

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:37.359 
the trigger to plays in all things I

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:43.179 
the trigger to plays in all things I
haven't<00:03:38.359> used<00:03:38.540> that<00:03:38.629> but<00:03:38.930> once<00:03:39.109> or<00:03:39.290> twice<00:03:42.189> I've

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:43.189 
haven't used that but once or twice I've

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:48.990 
haven't used that but once or twice I've
used<00:03:43.430> them<00:03:43.609> a<00:03:43.669> lot<00:03:43.699> of<00:03:45.549> these<00:03:46.549> jewelry<00:03:46.970> boxes<00:03:47.449> I

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
used them a lot of these jewelry boxes I

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.390 
used them a lot of these jewelry boxes I
think<00:03:50.000> this<00:03:50.150> was<00:03:50.359> one<00:03:50.599> of<00:03:50.629> the<00:03:50.750> ones<00:03:51.400> this

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
think this was one of the ones this

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.599 
think this was one of the ones this
wasn't<00:03:52.609> quite<00:03:52.849> big<00:03:53.150> enough<00:03:53.180> for<00:03:54.340> so<00:03:55.340> I<00:03:55.400> went

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:55.609 
wasn't quite big enough for so I went

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:00.480 
wasn't quite big enough for so I went
back<00:03:55.790> and<00:03:55.970> got<00:03:56.319> this<00:03:57.319> bounce<00:03:57.650> crossed
