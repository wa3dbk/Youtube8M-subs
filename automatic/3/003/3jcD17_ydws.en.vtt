00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:12.469 
the new revo series of drills we've done

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:14.529 
the new revo series of drills we've done
some<00:00:12.679> major<00:00:12.860> changes<00:00:12.980> on<00:00:13.429> the<00:00:13.519> revo<00:00:13.789> family<00:00:14.209> as

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:14.539 
some major changes on the revo family as

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:16.810 
some major changes on the revo family as
you<00:00:14.749> can<00:00:14.900> see<00:00:15.049> much<00:00:15.709> more<00:00:15.919> compact<00:00:16.309> in<00:00:16.520> design

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:16.820 
you can see much more compact in design

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.340 
you can see much more compact in design
really<00:00:17.480> fits<00:00:17.720> in<00:00:17.810> your<00:00:17.840> hand<00:00:17.960> really

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350 
really fits in your hand really

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.320 
really fits in your hand really
comfortably<00:00:18.800> a<00:00:19.070> lot<00:00:19.400> lower<00:00:19.580> profile<00:00:20.120> so

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
comfortably a lot lower profile so

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.330 
comfortably a lot lower profile so
really<00:00:20.690> much<00:00:21.410> more<00:00:21.560> comfortable<00:00:22.010> fit<00:00:22.160> with

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
really much more comfortable fit with

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.550 
really much more comfortable fit with
all<00:00:22.460> day<00:00:22.670> also<00:00:23.510> lightened<00:00:24.050> up<00:00:24.110> these<00:00:24.290> reels

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
all day also lightened up these reels

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.750 
all day also lightened up these reels
some<00:00:24.800> of<00:00:24.890> them<00:00:25.010> are<00:00:25.100> up<00:00:25.160> to<00:00:25.310> thirty<00:00:25.490> percent

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
some of them are up to thirty percent

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.640 
some of them are up to thirty percent
weight<00:00:26.000> saving<00:00:26.420> so<00:00:26.600> again<00:00:26.870> just<00:00:27.140> makes<00:00:27.530> it

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
weight saving so again just makes it

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.859 
weight saving so again just makes it
much<00:00:27.830> more<00:00:28.010> comfortable<00:00:28.400> to<00:00:28.490> fish<00:00:28.670> with<00:00:28.869> we

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
much more comfortable to fish with we

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:31.810 
much more comfortable to fish with we
also<00:00:29.990> have<00:00:30.110> a<00:00:30.260> new<00:00:30.470> gear<00:00:30.710> system<00:00:31.070> so<00:00:31.220> again<00:00:31.490> is

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
also have a new gear system so again is

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.299 
also have a new gear system so again is
there<00:00:32.029> a<00:00:32.059> new<00:00:32.390> more<00:00:32.629> powerful<00:00:32.659> real<00:00:33.320> this<00:00:33.890> D<00:00:34.129> to

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
there a new more powerful real this D to

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:36.520 
there a new more powerful real this D to
a<00:00:34.339> gear<00:00:34.579> system<00:00:34.940> is<00:00:35.510> much<00:00:35.809> more<00:00:36.050> efficient

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
a gear system is much more efficient

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.079 
a gear system is much more efficient
than<00:00:36.620> the<00:00:36.679> previous<00:00:37.100> gear<00:00:37.280> system<00:00:37.609> so<00:00:37.969> it's

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:38.089 
than the previous gear system so it's

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:40.930 
than the previous gear system so it's
easier<00:00:38.510> to<00:00:38.629> wind<00:00:38.870> in<00:00:39.079> bait<00:00:39.319> or<00:00:39.769> big<00:00:40.039> fish<00:00:40.309> also

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
easier to wind in bait or big fish also

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.819 
easier to wind in bait or big fish also
give<00:00:41.210> them<00:00:41.329> some<00:00:41.480> a<00:00:41.719> much<00:00:42.019> wider<00:00:42.260> ranging<00:00:42.679> ear

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
give them some a much wider ranging ear

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.399 
give them some a much wider ranging ear
