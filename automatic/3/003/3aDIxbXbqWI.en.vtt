we're gonna be taking a look at some
slime<00:00:09.660> block<00:00:09.900> powered<00:00:10.260> TNT<00:00:10.769> launchers

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
slime block powered TNT launchers

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.770 
slime block powered TNT launchers
recently<00:00:11.759> I<00:00:11.790> found<00:00:12.030> this<00:00:12.240> when<00:00:12.420> I<00:00:12.450> was<00:00:12.570> looking

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
recently I found this when I was looking

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.570 
recently I found this when I was looking
around<00:00:12.840> on<00:00:13.080> YouTube<00:00:13.230> this<00:00:13.799> was<00:00:13.980> made<00:00:14.160> by<00:00:14.190> nice

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
around on YouTube this was made by nice

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.790 
around on YouTube this was made by nice
marked<00:00:14.849> MC<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.509> what<00:00:16.139> was<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.529> inspiration

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
marked MC and what was the inspiration

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.529 
marked MC and what was the inspiration
for<00:00:17.279> my<00:00:17.490> slightly<00:00:17.880> smaller<00:00:18.119> design<00:00:18.359> over

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
for my slightly smaller design over

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.460 
for my slightly smaller design over
there<00:00:18.660> but<00:00:18.869> we're<00:00:18.960> gonna<00:00:19.050> take<00:00:19.199> a<00:00:19.260> look<00:00:19.350> at

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
there but we're gonna take a look at

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.500 
there but we're gonna take a look at
this<00:00:19.529> one<00:00:19.710> first<00:00:19.890> so<00:00:20.460> this<00:00:20.789> one<00:00:20.910> goes<00:00:21.029> up<00:00:21.330> and

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
this one first so this one goes up and

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.960 
this one first so this one goes up and
over<00:00:21.990> launches<00:00:22.529> TNT<00:00:23.010> blocks<00:00:23.279> roughly<00:00:23.760> thirty

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
over launches TNT blocks roughly thirty

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.320 
over launches TNT blocks roughly thirty
blocks<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.449> way<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:24.900> works<00:00:25.740> pretty<00:00:25.920> well

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
blocks that way and works pretty well

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.140 
blocks that way and works pretty well
5x5<00:00:27.330> one<00:00:27.900> block<00:00:28.109> wide<00:00:28.320> really<00:00:29.010> slim<00:00:29.429> really

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
5x5 one block wide really slim really

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.540 
5x5 one block wide really slim really
nice<00:00:30.330> I<00:00:30.660> like<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.199> with<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:31.890> when<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.160> saw<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.520> I

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
nice I like it with that when I saw it I

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.920 
nice I like it with that when I saw it I
thought<00:00:32.700> maybe<00:00:33.180> this<00:00:33.390> could<00:00:33.510> be<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.660> little<00:00:33.780> bit

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
thought maybe this could be a little bit

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.900 
thought maybe this could be a little bit
smaller<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.410> with<00:00:34.739> this<00:00:34.920> we<00:00:35.190> go<00:00:35.340> over<00:00:35.700> and

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
smaller and with this we go over and

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.389 
smaller and with this we go over and
then<00:00:36.090> up<00:00:36.270> rather<00:00:36.540> than<00:00:36.809> up<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.230> over<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.710> we

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
then up rather than up and over and we

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.650 
then up rather than up and over and we
don't<00:00:38.520> really<00:00:38.730> have<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.969> use<00:00:39.090> any<00:00:39.239> redstone

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
don't really have to use any redstone

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.630 
don't really have to use any redstone
other<00:00:39.870> than<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.079> couple<00:00:40.320> repeaters<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:40.980> we<00:00:41.520> do

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
other than a couple repeaters so we do

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.040 
other than a couple repeaters so we do
that<00:00:41.820> we<00:00:41.969> get<00:00:42.059> about<00:00:42.239> 30<00:00:42.420> blocks<00:00:42.690> from<00:00:42.840> the

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
that we get about 30 blocks from the

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.900 
that we get about 30 blocks from the
front<00:00:43.379> right<00:00:43.500> there

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
front right there

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.729 
front right there
starting<00:00:44.910> this<00:00:45.780> area<00:00:46.050> right<00:00:46.170> here<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:46.410> one

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
starting this area right here is one

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.150 
starting this area right here is one
that<00:00:47.129> would<00:00:47.250> be<00:00:47.340> 5<00:00:47.610> 10<00:00:47.910> 15<00:00:48.450> 20<00:00:48.480> 25<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.770> 30<00:00:50.039> would

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
that would be 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 would

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.650 
that would be 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 would
be<00:00:50.280> that<00:00:50.430> middle<00:00:50.610> bedrock<00:00:51.000> which<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.420> what<00:00:51.570> we

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
be that middle bedrock which is what we

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.510 
be that middle bedrock which is what we
land<00:00:51.870> on<00:00:52.050> pretty<00:00:52.620> much<00:00:52.739> every<00:00:53.070> time<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.460> we

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
land on pretty much every time that we

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.970 
land on pretty much every time that we
watch<00:00:53.699> this<00:00:53.940> over<00:00:54.170> so<00:00:55.170> from<00:00:55.350> here<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.649> can<00:00:55.770> see

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
watch this over so from here you can see

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.170 
watch this over so from here you can see
pretty<00:00:56.160> much<00:00:56.250> everything<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.670> this<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:56.969> made

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
pretty much everything that this is made

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.880 
pretty much everything that this is made
of<00:00:57.329> but<00:00:57.629> for<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.930> quick<00:00:58.079> tutorial<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.620> guess<00:00:58.770> we

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
of but for a quick tutorial I guess we

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.069 
of but for a quick tutorial I guess we
can<00:00:59.039> do<00:00:59.129> one<00:00:59.250> release<00:00:59.550> right<00:01:00.149> here<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:00.809> we're

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
can do one release right here so we're

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.299 
can do one release right here so we're
gonna<00:01:01.170> place<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.500> couple<00:01:01.710> blocks<00:01:01.980> right<00:01:02.219> here

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
gonna place a couple blocks right here

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.380 
gonna place a couple blocks right here
here<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:02.820> here

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
here and here

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.060 
here and here
block<00:01:04.049> here<00:01:04.290> just<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:04.559> we<00:01:04.589> can<00:01:04.739> place<00:01:04.890> our

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
block here just so we can place our

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.460 
block here just so we can place our
dispenser<00:01:05.790> facing<00:01:06.000> upwards<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.810> button<00:01:07.290> on<00:01:07.350> the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
dispenser facing upwards a button on the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.920 
dispenser facing upwards a button on the
side<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:07.860> fill<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.670> up<00:01:08.729> with<00:01:08.880> some<00:01:09.210> TNT

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
side of that fill that up with some TNT

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.080 
side of that fill that up with some TNT
then<00:01:10.320> on<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.189> front<00:01:11.430> we're<00:01:11.580> going<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.760> need<00:01:11.880> a

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
then on the front we're going to need a

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.270 
then on the front we're going to need a
redstone<00:01:12.600> repeater<00:01:12.840> on<00:01:13.409> its<00:01:13.590> second<00:01:13.950> tick<00:01:14.100> on

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
redstone repeater on its second tick on

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.969 
redstone repeater on its second tick on
the<00:01:14.850> back<00:01:15.030> one<00:01:15.390> on<00:01:15.509> its<00:01:15.630> first<00:01:15.780> tick<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.320> sticky

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
the back one on its first tick a sticky

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.370 
the back one on its first tick a sticky
piston<00:01:17.159> facing<00:01:17.700> forwards<00:01:18.210> one<00:01:18.900> facing

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
piston facing forwards one facing

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.740 
piston facing forwards one facing
upwards<00:01:19.890> on<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.130> front<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.610> sticky<00:01:21.540> block

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
upwards on the front a sticky block

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.929 
upwards on the front a sticky block
there<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.170> another<00:01:22.860> slime<00:01:23.159> block<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.640> that

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
there and another slime block and that

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.130 
there and another slime block and that
should<00:01:24.000> be<00:01:24.240> about<00:01:24.420> others<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.869> it

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
should be about others to it

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.080 
should be about others to it
hit<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.710> button<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.159> your<00:01:26.490> TNT<00:01:26.880> will<00:01:27.000> go
