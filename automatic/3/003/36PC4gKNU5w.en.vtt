a refund on your thing I know those are
two<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.650> stipulations<00:01:11.189> that's<00:01:11.369> correct

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
two of the stipulations that's correct

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.460 
two of the stipulations that's correct
but<00:01:11.760> we<00:01:11.909> also<00:01:12.119> we<00:01:12.780> have<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.080> protect<00:01:13.320> ourselves
