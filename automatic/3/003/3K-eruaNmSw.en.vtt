00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.639
 Well, since we are already 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:12.460
 we have the ship practically made 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:14.860
 We are going to perform the last steps 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.080
 which are a little more complicated and 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.570
 that half of them I think we're going to 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.099
 do on imaginary lines worth what 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.940
 first thing we're going to do is take the 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:25.850
 part of here 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.080
 up good before you start with the 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:31.100
 pins what we are going to do is prepare 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:34.119
 this is this we are going to fold it peak 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.119
 towards here 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.930
 and we turn it over and in the other peak 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.239
 we do exactly the same thing we are going 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.570
 to raise it up and apply it 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.950
 about yourself 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.420
 OK 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.420
 leaving us in this way 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.000
 once we have it so what are we going 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:01:00.660
 to do is let's start with the 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.670
 you 're here we're going to fold what 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.400
 on the center line if you notice 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.960
 is going to pull the wing is worth it because the 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.960
 wing we also have to fold over 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.710
 itself the central part we have it that 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.710
 make finite 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:22.940
 and force everything to fold 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:26.770
 towards the center here we bring it towards 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:30.160
 here and this wing we're going to hit 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.160
 in half 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.760
 let's mark it well as you see what 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.400
 we have done is would stay like this now what 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.160
 let's do on the other side we're 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.079
 let's take this one from here we're going to 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:49.630
 stick it on yourself 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:53.979
 We will pull the wing but I will 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.990
 I accompany is not accompanied, I accompany and 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:59.009
 he will also make the sheets 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.009
 for life 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:07.060
 if not adjust it worried the wall 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.060
 It depends a lot on paper 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.760
 with which we would remain 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:30.040
 at least this way you see that it was a 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.040
 little bit there marked but good 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.310
 Well now what we are going to do is with 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:41.310
 the other side equal 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.310
 ok let's go around the paper 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:48.670
 and we are going to do the same 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:51.020
 let's do everything the same until here 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:55.069
 let's have the finest plane 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:59.040
 ariel x with de alcer planes 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:01.750
 and arrest her equal we double 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.360
 by half 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:08.140
 we force 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.140
 we force that player 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:17.200
 OK 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.200
 and now the other one 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:27.920
 you see 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:27.920
 in the center and now the wing half 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.990
 but also practically half of the 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.380
 wind king room made now will 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.600
 for the others that remain open 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:48.390
 for that because we put it out to 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.580
 than the center and we look for those that do not 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:54.420
 we have folded in this case this 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.930
 to the center 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:00.939
 and it will not go 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.939
 and here equal to Celtic 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.200
 you have to adjust well 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:16.850
 and now on the other side it marks well in 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.420
 the other side 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.180
 same 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:25.949
 to finite 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.949
 and now what are we going 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.569
 and we mark very well 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.270
 OK 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:46.399
 we go back to its original state we already have 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.300
 two parts done you see it already we 

00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:51.960
 it would be the last 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.960
 we open 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.760
 and about yourself as we are doing 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.030
 we talk to the center 

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:05.819
 no way 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.430
 Gabriel 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.800
 these fish are very complicated very 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:22.009
 difficult and very much depends on the paper 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:24.670
 that we use in case then paper 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:27.110
 quite economic 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:29.000
 and on the other side 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.770
 the same and it is the last fold that 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.090
 we make 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.090
 to our ex wing 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.810
 and now 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.529
 plus 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:48.159
 rough 

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:51.159
 and we return it to its state it's worth it 

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:53.259
 would be more finite as you see it is already going 

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:55.689
 appreciating good now we are left with the 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:57.440
 engines that we have left two 

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:59.660
 peaks here 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:03.050
 it is not appreciated 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:05.870
 ok today we're going to do is we're going to 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.650
 apply in 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:11.780
 you see 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.780
 I pick up and fold in 

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:22.219
 arranged and in the other equal 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:38.770
 you see and we have already done what in the 

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:41.020
 back side 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:44.710
 so now we are going to make the peaks that 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:46.330
 already in the last ones always before are the 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:49.120
 folds 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:52.240
 that this if you want you do it or that is me 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:55.289
 like to mark everything before doing it 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.289
 just double 

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:00.509
 I doubled it 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:05.560
 and then I do the internal folds 

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:18.870
 so now we take this unfold 

00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:21.870
 for example 

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.870
 implementing 

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:30.040
 you have 

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:32.880
 Well, each and every one of 

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.880
 the peaks 

00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:37.309
 the lasers 

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.690
 OK 

00:07:55.430 --> 00:08:01.910
 well nothing 

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:01.910
 we already have it if you can appreciate 

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:08.540
 we have already finished it, we have 

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:08.540
 our x winder
