alright<00:02:11.730> so<00:02:11.849> there<00:02:12.030> you<00:02:12.060> can<00:02:12.180> see<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.540> size

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
alright so there you can see the size

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.170 
alright so there you can see the size
comparison<00:02:13.230> with<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.650> minifigs<00:02:14.099> and<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.700> Chi

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
comparison with the minifigs and the Chi

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.830 
comparison with the minifigs and the Chi
variant<00:02:15.750> of<00:02:16.200> those<00:02:16.640> so<00:02:17.640> if<00:02:18.000> you<00:02:18.060> take<00:02:18.270> a<00:02:18.510> quick

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
variant of those so if you take a quick

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.250 
variant of those so if you take a quick
look<00:02:19.140> you<00:02:19.560> can<00:02:20.370> kind<00:02:20.580> of<00:02:20.640> see<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:21.690> differences

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
look you can kind of see the differences

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.160 
look you can kind of see the differences
there<00:02:22.620> in<00:02:23.520> those<00:02:23.730> two<00:02:24.030> characters<00:02:24.690> I<00:02:25.020> mean

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
there in those two characters I mean

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.690 
there in those two characters I mean
they<00:02:25.290> are<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.560> same<00:02:25.770> character<00:02:26.250> just<00:02:26.459> the

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
they are the same character just the

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.020 
they are the same character just the
cheap<00:02:27.390> powered<00:02:27.810> version<00:02:28.290> of<00:02:28.440> it<00:02:28.560> so<00:02:29.400> really

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
cheap powered version of it so really

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.530 
cheap powered version of it so really
nice<00:02:30.150> details<00:02:30.780> there<00:02:32.690> really<00:02:33.690> like<00:02:33.989> these

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
nice details there really like these

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:42.479 
nice details there really like these
good<00:02:36.540> job<00:02:37.610> nice<00:02:38.610> little<00:02:38.970> quick

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:48.430 

she's<00:02:43.489> gonna<00:02:43.640> step<00:02:43.940> on<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.150> back

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.700 

that<00:02:49.440> was<00:02:50.300> war<00:02:51.300> Eze<00:02:51.570> all<00:02:52.170> right<00:02:52.260> so<00:02:52.410> let's<00:02:52.560> take

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
that was war Eze all right so let's take

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:53.660 
that was war Eze all right so let's take
a<00:02:52.770> look<00:02:52.920> at<00:02:53.040> cragger

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
a look at cragger

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.800 
a look at cragger
I<00:02:53.930> think<00:02:54.930> cragger<00:02:55.320> is<00:02:55.530> by<00:02:55.890> far<00:02:56.160> my<00:02:56.630> favorite<00:02:57.630> of

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
I think cragger is by far my favorite of

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.540 
I think cragger is by far my favorite of
the<00:02:58.530> Chi<00:02:58.830> variant

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
the Chi variant

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.610 
the Chi variant
he's<00:03:00.150> got<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:00.450> opening<00:03:00.900> and<00:03:01.050> closing<00:03:01.470> his

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
he's got the opening and closing his

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.820 
he's got the opening and closing his
mouth<00:03:01.890> on<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:02.820> headpiece<00:03:03.260> the<00:03:04.260> back<00:03:04.500> side<00:03:04.800> of

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
mouth on the headpiece the back side of

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.500 
mouth on the headpiece the back side of
the<00:03:05.400> set<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:06.420> spine<00:03:07.400> the<00:03:08.400> croc<00:03:08.670> is<00:03:09.000> very

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
the set the spine the croc is very

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.860 
the set the spine the croc is very
realized<00:03:09.990> the<00:03:10.290> nice<00:03:10.470> tail<00:03:11.390> his<00:03:12.390> weapon

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
realized the nice tail his weapon

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.960 
realized the nice tail his weapon
connects<00:03:13.530> to<00:03:13.650> both<00:03:13.800> hands<00:03:14.070> so<00:03:14.280> I<00:03:14.310> like<00:03:14.790> that

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
connects to both hands so I like that

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.160 
connects to both hands so I like that
kind<00:03:15.120> of<00:03:15.240> staff<00:03:15.510> that<00:03:16.340> axe<00:03:17.340> looked<00:03:17.700> to<00:03:17.850> it<00:03:18.170> lots

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
of details there in him and a comparison

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.990 
of details there in him and a comparison
with<00:03:22.650> his<00:03:24.230> minifig<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:26.160> only<00:03:26.550> thing<00:03:26.700> I<00:03:26.790> see

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
with his minifig the only thing I see

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.990 
with his minifig the only thing I see
here<00:03:27.240> is<00:03:27.390> the<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:28.140> left<00:03:28.410> eye<00:03:28.590> of<00:03:28.620> cragger<00:03:29.070> was

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
here is the the left eye of cragger was

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.210 
here is the the left eye of cragger was
damaged<00:03:30.570> but<00:03:31.260> doesn't<00:03:31.590> really<00:03:31.680> show<00:03:31.980> that

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
damaged but doesn't really show that

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.240 
damaged but doesn't really show that
here<00:03:32.490> on<00:03:32.670> the<00:03:32.820> larger<00:03:33.210> version<00:03:33.390> of<00:03:33.720> him<00:03:34.010> and<00:03:35.010> I

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
here on the larger version of him and I

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.950 
here on the larger version of him and I
don't<00:03:35.310> know<00:03:35.580> if<00:03:35.730> she<00:03:36.000> repairs<00:03:37.370> damages<00:03:38.840> to<00:03:39.840> the

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:39.960 
don't know if she repairs damages to the

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.830 
don't know if she repairs damages to the
body<00:03:40.170> but<00:03:41.960> neither<00:03:42.960> here<00:03:43.290> nor<00:03:43.320> there<00:03:43.730> really

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
body but neither here nor there really

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.260 
body but neither here nor there really
call<00:03:45.840> that<00:03:46.110> a<00:03:46.290> bad<00:03:46.760> but<00:03:47.760> just<00:03:47.790> some<00:03:48.120> of<00:03:48.150> the

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
call that a bad but just some of the

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:49.910 
call that a bad but just some of the
detail<00:03:48.600> that<00:03:48.630> I<00:03:48.840> think<00:03:49.080> Lego<00:03:49.530> could<00:03:49.710> have<00:03:49.800> put

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
detail that I think Lego could have put

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.770 
detail that I think Lego could have put
in<00:03:50.010> there<00:03:50.160> just<00:03:50.190> making<00:03:50.670> sure<00:03:50.910> they<00:03:51.120> they<00:03:51.570> look

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
in there just making sure they they look

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.220 
in there just making sure they they look
exactly<00:03:52.080> like<00:03:52.640> the<00:03:54.050> minifigure<00:03:55.050> thing

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
exactly like the minifigure thing

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.410 
exactly like the minifigure thing
representing<00:03:55.740> but<00:03:55.950> overall<00:03:56.730> these<00:03:57.000> sets<00:03:57.270> are

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
representing but overall these sets are

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.710 
representing but overall these sets are
probably<00:03:58.700> probably<00:03:59.700> the<00:04:00.000> best<00:04:00.210> I<00:04:00.390> would<00:04:00.450> say

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
probably probably the best I would say

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.960 
probably probably the best I would say
is<00:04:00.840> cragger<00:04:01.320> out<00:04:01.530> of<00:04:01.740> all<00:04:01.920> six<00:04:02.250> of<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:02.550> Chi

of<00:04:33.240> it's<00:04:33.420> almost<00:04:33.630> like<00:04:33.780> the<00:04:33.930> Creator<00:04:35.300> LEGO

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
of it's almost like the Creator LEGO

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.300 
of it's almost like the Creator LEGO
sets<00:04:36.540> there's<00:04:37.380> different<00:04:37.800> ways<00:04:37.950> that<00:04:38.010> you

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
sets there's different ways that you

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.770 
sets there's different ways that you
could<00:04:38.430> put<00:04:38.610> these<00:04:38.760> things<00:04:38.940> together<00:04:39.120> and<00:04:39.420> Lego

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
could put these things together and Lego

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.190 
could put these things together and Lego
gives<00:04:40.140> you<00:04:40.290> the<00:04:40.530> build<00:04:41.460> of<00:04:41.670> it<00:04:41.790> so<00:04:42.060> I<00:04:42.330> really

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
gives you the build of it so I really

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.890 
gives you the build of it so I really
like<00:04:43.380> this<00:04:43.560> it's<00:04:44.280> got<00:04:44.490> that<00:04:44.900> double-sided

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
like this it's got that double-sided

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.930 
like this it's got that double-sided
dual<00:04:46.590> wielding<00:04:47.100> going<00:04:47.370> on<00:04:47.490> there

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
dual wielding going on there

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.990 
dual wielding going on there
he's<00:04:48.940> got<00:04:49.120> a<00:04:49.150> tail<00:04:49.510> now<00:04:50.170> I<00:04:50.550> mean<00:04:51.550> wolves<00:04:51.820> have

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
he's got a tail now I mean wolves have

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.500 
he's got a tail now I mean wolves have
tails

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
tails

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.960 
tails
that's<00:04:53.290> not<00:04:53.500> outside<00:04:54.370> the<00:04:54.400> realm<00:04:54.580> of

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
that's not outside the realm of

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.150 
that's not outside the realm of
possibility

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
possibility

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.650 
possibility
much<00:04:57.160> more<00:04:57.370> aggressive<00:04:57.520> there<00:04:58.120> I<00:04:58.150> like<00:04:58.540> the

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
much more aggressive there I like the

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.930 
much more aggressive there I like the
dual<00:04:58.840> wielding<00:04:59.350> that's<00:05:00.220> a<00:05:00.400> look<00:05:00.610> at<00:05:00.820> the

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
dual wielding that's a look at the

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.400 
dual wielding that's a look at the
combination<00:05:01.210> of<00:05:01.750> Qi<00:05:02.260> war<00:05:02.620> is<00:05:02.800> with<00:05:03.190> Qi<00:05:03.550> cragger

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
combination of Qi war is with Qi cragger

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.300 
combination of Qi war is with Qi cragger
now<00:05:05.410> let's<00:05:05.590> take<00:05:05.710> a<00:05:05.740> look<00:05:05.890> at<00:05:06.040> the<00:05:06.100> combination

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
now let's take a look at the combination

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:11.370 
now let's take a look at the combination
of<00:05:06.760> Qi<00:05:06.970> cragger<00:05:07.270> which<00:05:07.600> she<00:05:07.840> wore<00:05:08.080> Eze<00:05:10.380> all

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
of Qi cragger which she wore Eze all

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.290 
of Qi cragger which she wore Eze all
right<00:05:11.530> so<00:05:11.680> this<00:05:11.860> is<00:05:11.920> Qi<00:05:12.520> cragger

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
right so this is Qi cragger

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.620 
right so this is Qi cragger
with<00:05:13.660> parts<00:05:14.140> from<00:05:14.230> Qi<00:05:14.770> war<00:05:15.100> as<00:05:15.310> to<00:05:15.730> make<00:05:15.910> the

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
with parts from Qi war as to make the

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.500 
with parts from Qi war as to make the
combined<00:05:17.020> version<00:05:17.500> of<00:05:17.770> the<00:05:18.100> two<00:05:18.280> I<00:05:18.940> have

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
combined version of the two I have

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.870 
combined version of the two I have
finally<00:05:20.110> been<00:05:20.290> able<00:05:20.410> to<00:05:20.650> get<00:05:20.950> online<00:05:21.250> not

thing<00:06:36.469> the<00:06:37.069> mouth<00:06:37.339> open<00:06:38.319> closes<00:06:39.399> which<00:06:40.399> is

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:40.669 
thing the mouth open closes which is

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:44.949 
thing the mouth open closes which is
another<00:06:41.469> plus<00:06:42.789> he<00:06:43.789> is<00:06:43.939> the<00:06:44.089> cragger's<00:06:44.779> the

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:44.959 
another plus he is the cragger's the

00:06:44.959 --> 00:06:47.349 
another plus he is the cragger's the
only<00:06:45.319> currently<00:06:45.859> available<00:06:46.279> set<00:06:46.909> that<00:06:47.179> has<00:06:47.329> a

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:47.359 
only currently available set that has a

00:06:47.359 --> 00:06:50.409 
only currently available set that has a
head<00:06:47.929> that<00:06:48.609> opened<00:06:49.609> the<00:06:49.699> closes<00:06:50.119> for<00:06:50.359> the

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:50.419 
head that opened the closes for the

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:53.199 
head that opened the closes for the
mouth<00:06:50.949> so<00:06:51.949> again<00:06:52.369> this<00:06:52.489> is<00:06:52.639> the<00:06:52.729> first<00:06:52.939> build

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:53.209 
mouth so again this is the first build

00:06:53.209 --> 00:06:54.429 
mouth so again this is the first build
that<00:06:53.359> I've<00:06:53.479> done<00:06:53.629> where<00:06:53.899> I<00:06:53.929> haven't<00:06:54.259> tried<00:06:54.409> to

00:06:54.429 --> 00:06:54.439 
that I've done where I haven't tried to

00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:55.959 
that I've done where I haven't tried to
do<00:06:54.589> it<00:06:54.709> just<00:06:54.949> off<00:06:55.129> of<00:06:55.159> the<00:06:55.369> photos<00:06:55.759> I've

00:06:55.959 --> 00:06:55.969 
do it just off of the photos I've

00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:57.809 
do it just off of the photos I've
actually<00:06:56.149> done<00:06:56.389> about<00:06:56.629> the<00:06:56.749> instruction

00:06:57.809 --> 00:06:57.819 
actually done about the instruction

00:06:57.819 --> 00:07:00.249 
actually done about the instruction
they're<00:06:58.819> building<00:06:59.239> instructions<00:06:59.689> from<00:06:59.929> Lego

00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:00.259 
they're building instructions from Lego

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:02.649 
they're building instructions from Lego
comm<00:07:00.679> so<00:07:01.549> that's<00:07:01.789> a<00:07:01.909> look<00:07:02.119> at<00:07:02.299> the<00:07:02.449> combination

00:07:02.649 --> 00:07:02.659 
comm so that's a look at the combination

00:07:02.659 --> 00:07:07.809 
comm so that's a look at the combination
of<00:07:03.169> Juarez<00:07:03.739> and<00:07:04.039> cragger<00:07:04.669> the<00:07:05.029> Chi<00:07:05.209> variants
