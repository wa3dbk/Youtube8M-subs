00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.620
 good day I'm going to explain to you how 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.080
 an alarm 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:12.790
 installs on a fosti grande retro 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:15.130
 scooter with a gy6 engine block 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.079
 i bought the alarm on ebay it is 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.710
 a small cupboard 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:22.810
 nice easy simple and nice and cheap 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.579
 this is the key ring that comes with it 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.839
 descent 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:31.329
 all works fine well you start with 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:32.470
 you to remove your hood and your room 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:34.540
 to expose the tree 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.890
 now i have a part this part i already have 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.110
 closed 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.040
 so I'm not going to let that go easily 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.870
 see 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.600
 maybe I will cut it open who knows 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.160
 we fine that you expose 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.780
 you search for the wire of the ignition switch 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.240
 ignition switch 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:53.590
 those followed thread and voila then you come 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:57.780
 at the socket of your ignition switch 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.780
 different valleys are logical 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:05.799
 here you have to watch out a bit because 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:08.679
 it starts here with a red rose 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:13.950
 black and a green wire when you get there 

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:13.950
 outcome looks like it can do magic 

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:21.189
 when I open it a dog gets one 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.619
 message connection to learn one 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:26.829
 little orange and black and white 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:29.439
 two green and one black wire 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:32.109
 keep in mind that it differs 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.729
 by measuring color by then you make no 

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:37.840
 wrong 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:40.149
 you start and very important guys like that 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.869
 goes loose otherwise you're right 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:45.130
 short circuit 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:47.259
 god makes something wrong and turn off contact 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.670
 then you take the lead from you 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.609
 alarm system 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:55.929
 you attach it to this on the side of 

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:59.289
 your key switch with the orange one 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:02.349
 thread little orange so on behind I call 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.899
 it also with smart and use subsite 

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:07.080
 clips easy to connect easy 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:10.080
 to release 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.930
 if you are connected then you go 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.350
 back to your room tree from your alarm 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:19.170
 Grab the black wire and make it 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:22.340
 attached to a piece of frame with a beautiful eye 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.340
 if you focus 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.250
 both that a bit blank is below 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.400
 so he makes good contact you to 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:35.460
 for a moment, for example 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:36.830
 then possibly q then you grab the two wires that 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.950
 from you 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:42.180
 ignition switch and sewing contact block 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.560
 that is the 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:49.040
 and white black wire there also the black 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.040
 you cut it 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:57.780
 on the side of your contact block 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.240
 connect the gray wire to the side 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:04.470
 of your ignition switch 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:08.850
 connect the pink wire if you have it 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:12.239
 done then you go back to your block 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.970
 of your alarm system 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:19.230
 then you grab the orange wire that you clamp 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:24.330
 stuck on the side of your ignition switch 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:27.030
 on the black thread then actually 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.940
 the most important wires stuck on 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:33.540
 one after that is the blue thread that 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.320
 runs here which will decrease that can 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.760
 not missing 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.810
 it is also on most 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:45.800
 descriptions such as this are a soap 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.800
 schedule and it fits perfectly 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:51.150
 then you grab the blue thread in that 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.630
 shock it 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:58.110
 protective cover we sit and thread and that 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:00.330
 is yellow with red 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:06.989
 that's right with a yellow and a red one 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:10.140
 wire and that I can fine so you see 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:12.350
 a bit of red but focus it 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.350
 unfortunately 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:20.239
 we look forward to asking for you there 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.550
 not the one but the entire one with smoking 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.210
 so with every engine is the same 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.170
 this 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:29.450
 you make the wiring harness the blue one there 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:32.540
 wire to it 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.160
 then I have two wires running that you can 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.130
 I felt they could not now see soon 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:42.169
 but go your lights 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:44.480
 cut lie where are you right now 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.730
 that you follow you pull on both sides 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:52.520
 so that you feel you are sure the 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:55.580
 good thread and those are the two 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:58.640
 so there is an orange and a green one 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.140
 and for me a blue light blue 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.610
 and green 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.520
 the two yellow wires are in front 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:07.780
 If you have that bill you can turn them on 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.950
 attach it to the blue and to the 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:13.520
 orange from the green 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:16.729
 threads of a green 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:20.240
 contact blocks when you have done it 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:23.710
 then you make sure all is well and late 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.710
 your key from the contact 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.900
 then i am going to do my mother here 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.150
 fine then you plug in your alarm 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.339

00:05:48.609 --> 00:05:52.359
 well plugged in fuses are good 

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:54.599

00:05:52.359 --> 00:05:54.599

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:04.349
 I have removed my alarm sound 

00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:07.389
 because it was a bit hard for here 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:11.519
 then you go see if it works 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:11.519
