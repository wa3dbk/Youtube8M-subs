00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.210
 Concealed models of the 23 series notes that from the mid-fifties 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.420
 from the past century to the year 2000, last lower Primex label 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.420
 pounded with polished wheels and fuels 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.590
 but also this cosmetics and worthy hide that the 23 outdated to 5 USD 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.629
 was 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:14.340
 That is why Merck's fans have turned to a modern one over the past few years 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.059
 Execution of the Bauer 23 serviced 

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:20.089
 with a contemporary look and an adequate drive 

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:24.579
 now finally the market leader lets this series on the model railway quietly 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:27.759
 Rolls and she needs visually and technically the comparison with the 

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:29.919
 Not to shy away from competition 

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:34.299
 many freestanding lines on the boiler dainty spoke wheels with their for 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.609
 Märklin ratio low lane limits 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:40.489
 and the perfect lighting with those requested by many model railways 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.889
 warm white Nele Days are a real feast for the eyes 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:47.639
 especially worthy of mention are the perfect hand Raúl on the kettle 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:50.819
 despite their minuteness, they break through and each have three 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.789
 Spokes open 

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:55.879
 the suitability for everyday use of the locomotive is very good 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:59.209
 Seegers soft roads through forgiven round problems 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.559
 the decoder gives the locomotive a silky smooth running and the sounds 

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:05.509
 from engine gearbox are barely audible 

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:08.649
 the traction properties leave nothing to be desired 

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:11.919
 the four wheels of the first and third axles have been pulling up on tack tires 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:15.889
 and because the middle axis is spring-mounted, it lures with its 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:19.079
 Weight of almost 300 grams completely on the prison sentences 

00:03:20.029 --> 00:03:23.559
 will they have been too heavily loaded the locomotive from on what the 

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:25.039
 Turn the wheels 

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:28.519
 Slopes on the system therefore masters the machine with flying colors 

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:36.040
 the locomotive is a representative of the week 3 that is the time between 05:40 

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:38.879
 Another is adorned 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:42.119
 if I had a desire in the markets designers free 

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:43.839
 here he is 

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:47.399
 makes at the steam locomotives finally the curve Sliders were mobile 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:52.359
 that can not be that hard the competition finally manages
