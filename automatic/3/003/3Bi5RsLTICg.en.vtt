00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.220 

last<00:00:22.910> week<00:00:23.090> we<00:00:23.240> talked<00:00:23.420> about<00:00:23.539> Rose<00:00:23.780> scoping

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
last week we talked about Rose scoping

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.779 
last week we talked about Rose scoping
and<00:00:24.560> how<00:00:24.680> useful<00:00:24.920> of<00:00:25.160> a<00:00:25.220> skull<00:00:25.430> can<00:00:25.610> be<00:00:25.700> in

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
and how useful of a skull can be in

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:27.250 
and how useful of a skull can be in
post-production<00:00:26.150> and<00:00:26.630> we<00:00:26.810> showed<00:00:26.990> you<00:00:27.110> how<00:00:27.200> to

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.260 
post-production and we showed you how to

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.570 
post-production and we showed you how to
use<00:00:27.350> the<00:00:27.529> pen<00:00:27.710> tool<00:00:27.740> to<00:00:28.070> mass<00:00:28.189> frame<00:00:28.400> by<00:00:28.550> frame

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
use the pen tool to mass frame by frame

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.790 
use the pen tool to mass frame by frame
which<00:00:29.480> is<00:00:29.630> actually<00:00:29.990> my<00:00:30.140> favorite<00:00:30.349> method

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
which is actually my favorite method

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.979 
which is actually my favorite method
because<00:00:31.130> of<00:00:31.279> how<00:00:31.369> accurate<00:00:31.759> you<00:00:31.849> can<00:00:31.880> be<00:00:32.090> wow

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
because of how accurate you can be wow

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.310 
because of how accurate you can be wow
we're<00:00:33.500> learning<00:00:33.680> so<00:00:34.100> much<00:00:34.309> about<00:00:34.370> you<00:00:35.320> but

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
we're learning so much about you but

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.600 
we're learning so much about you but
today<00:00:36.530> i'm<00:00:36.770> going<00:00:36.860> to<00:00:36.920> show<00:00:37.070> you<00:00:37.100> another<00:00:37.370> tool

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
today i'm going to show you another tool

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:38.920 
today i'm going to show you another tool
and<00:00:37.730> after<00:00:37.940> effects<00:00:38.180> that<00:00:38.300> accomplishes<00:00:38.809> is

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
and after effects that accomplishes is

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.600 
and after effects that accomplishes is
essentially<00:00:39.260> the<00:00:39.379> same<00:00:39.590> thing<00:00:39.650> but<00:00:40.129> it's

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
essentially the same thing but it's

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.340 
essentially the same thing but it's
actually<00:00:40.699> much<00:00:41.000> faster<00:00:41.059> it's<00:00:42.019> called<00:00:42.230> the

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
actually much faster it's called the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.049 
actually much faster it's called the
rotor<00:00:42.530> brush<00:00:42.710> tool<00:00:43.040> and<00:00:43.070> i<00:00:43.550> believe<00:00:43.820> it<00:00:43.970> was

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
rotor brush tool and i believe it was

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:45.970 
rotor brush tool and i believe it was
