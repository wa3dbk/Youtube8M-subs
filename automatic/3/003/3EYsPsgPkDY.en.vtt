one<00:00:54.420> thing<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.870> was<00:00:55.020> thinking<00:00:55.140> about<00:00:55.410> the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
one thing that I was thinking about the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.650 
one thing that I was thinking about the
maintenance<00:00:55.890> work<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:57.090> guess<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.329> little

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
maintenance work and I guess a little

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.470 
maintenance work and I guess a little
sad<00:00:57.899> was<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.350> fact<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:59.010> have<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.910> cat

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
sad was the fact that I have a cat

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.349

just<00:03:01.610> in<00:03:01.790> general<00:03:01.940> E<00:03:02.180> on<00:03:02.300> the<00:03:02.390> internet<00:03:02.690> really

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.870 
liked cats they really liked cat videos
and<00:03:05.510> I<00:03:05.870> think<00:03:06.050> it<00:03:06.110> would<00:03:06.200> be<00:03:06.290> so<00:03:06.500> cool<00:03:06.800> to

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
and I think it would be so cool to

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.449 
and I think it would be so cool to
document<00:03:07.880> the<00:03:08.209> cats<00:03:08.480> lives<00:03:08.959> you<00:03:09.950> know<00:03:10.130> from

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
document the cats lives you know from

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.000 
document the cats lives you know from
getting<00:03:11.420> them<00:03:11.630> to<00:03:11.900> you<00:03:12.170> know<00:03:12.290> growing<00:03:12.680> up<00:03:12.800> and

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
getting them to you know growing up and

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.530 
getting them to you know growing up and
it<00:03:13.130> wouldn't<00:03:13.340> be<00:03:13.430> a<00:03:13.459> daily<00:03:13.730> thing<00:03:13.940> but<00:03:14.390> you

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
it wouldn't be a daily thing but you

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.330 
it wouldn't be a daily thing but you
know<00:03:14.690> just<00:03:14.990> following<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:15.739> cat's<00:03:15.950> around<00:03:16.250> I

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
know just following the cat's around I

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.310 
know just following the cat's around I
think<00:03:16.519> that<00:03:16.610> would<00:03:16.700> be<00:03:16.730> so<00:03:16.970> cool<00:03:17.150> and<00:03:17.450> that

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
think that would be so cool and that

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.949 
think that would be so cool and that
would<00:03:18.410> just<00:03:18.440> tie<00:03:18.739> in<00:03:18.980> somewhat<00:03:19.880> with<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.180> vlog

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
would just tie in somewhat with the vlog

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.170 
would just tie in somewhat with the vlog
that<00:03:21.200> I<00:03:21.230> would<00:03:21.500> hopefully<00:03:21.950> still<00:03:22.760> be

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
that I would hopefully still be

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.620 
that I would hopefully still be
continuing<00:03:23.840> to<00:03:23.870> do<00:03:24.110> so<00:03:24.920> yeah<00:03:25.190> it<00:03:25.459> is<00:03:25.489> sad<00:03:26.269> with

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
continuing to do so yeah it is sad with

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.840 
continuing to do so yeah it is sad with
Rocco<00:03:27.230> and<00:03:27.380> all<00:03:27.500> but<00:03:27.709> there<00:03:28.160> is<00:03:28.280> a<00:03:28.310> positive

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
Rocco and all but there is a positive

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.340 
Rocco and all but there is a positive
aspect<00:03:28.940> of<00:03:29.360> it<00:03:29.480> looking<00:03:29.780> forward<00:03:30.080> to<00:03:30.200> these

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
aspect of it looking forward to these

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:31.960 
aspect of it looking forward to these
new<00:03:30.709> kitties<00:03:31.070> that<00:03:31.310> would<00:03:31.430> be<00:03:31.550> coming<00:03:31.760> into

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970
