but<00:00:05.240> we're<00:00:05.509> going<00:00:05.600> to<00:00:05.689> talk<00:00:05.870> to<00:00:05.990> you<00:00:06.080> about<00:00:06.170> now

00:00:06.429 --> 00:00:06.439 
but we're going to talk to you about now

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:09.190 
but we're going to talk to you about now
is<00:00:06.590> a<00:00:06.620> basic<00:00:07.069> pitch<00:00:07.340> now<00:00:08.240> pitch<00:00:08.540> is<00:00:08.809> one<00:00:08.990> that

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:09.200 
is a basic pitch now pitch is one that

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.100 
is a basic pitch now pitch is one that
actually<00:00:09.410> flights<00:00:09.920> more<00:00:10.490> than<00:00:10.670> it<00:00:10.790> runs<00:00:11.420> so

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110 
actually flights more than it runs so

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.499 
actually flights more than it runs so
what<00:00:12.350> happens<00:00:12.679> here<00:00:13.070> we<00:00:13.340> want<00:00:13.670> a<00:00:13.940> little<00:00:14.360> bit

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:14.509 
what happens here we want a little bit

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:16.960 
what happens here we want a little bit
of<00:00:14.630> cocking<00:00:15.139> in<00:00:15.320> the<00:00:15.440> actual<00:00:15.830> action<00:00:16.250> with<00:00:16.820> the

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970 
of cocking in the actual action with the

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.290 
of cocking in the actual action with the
chip<00:00:17.210> we<00:00:17.720> add<00:00:17.869> all<00:00:18.770> hinge<00:00:19.220> with<00:00:19.910> the<00:00:20.029> pitch

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
chip we add all hinge with the pitch

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.190 
chip we add all hinge with the pitch
it's<00:00:20.720> a<00:00:20.840> combination<00:00:21.230> of<00:00:22.640> and<00:00:22.930> the<00:00:23.930> wrist

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:24.200 
it's a combination of and the wrist

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.220 
it's a combination of and the wrist
hinge<00:00:24.770> so<00:00:25.340> a<00:00:25.369> combination<00:00:26.180> so<00:00:26.419> if<00:00:26.779> you<00:00:26.989> watch

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
hinge so a combination so if you watch

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.040 
hinge so a combination so if you watch
very<00:00:27.529> carefully<00:00:27.770> as<00:00:28.189> we<00:00:28.220> go<00:00:28.520> back<00:00:28.820> that's<00:00:29.720> at<00:00:29.960> a

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
very carefully as we go back that's at a

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.350 
very carefully as we go back that's at a
point<00:00:30.230> where<00:00:30.590> there's<00:00:30.829> no<00:00:31.009> real<00:00:31.340> risk

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
point where there's no real risk

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.930 
point where there's no real risk
and<00:00:32.599> as<00:00:32.960> we<00:00:33.140> go<00:00:33.320> beyond<00:00:33.710> that<00:00:34.010> first<00:00:34.550> movement

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
and as we go beyond that first movement

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.029 
and as we go beyond that first movement
then<00:00:35.300> the<00:00:35.450> wrist<00:00:35.989> now<00:00:36.559> we're<00:00:36.769> into<00:00:37.010> the

00:00:37.029 --> 00:00:37.039 
then the wrist now we're into the

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:39.069 
then the wrist now we're into the
pitching<00:00:37.519> mode<00:00:37.730> when<00:00:38.000> the<00:00:38.030> wrists<00:00:38.690> with

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
pitching mode when the wrists with

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:40.869 
pitching mode when the wrists with
that<00:00:39.230> natural<00:00:39.649> force<00:00:39.949> wanting<00:00:40.280> to<00:00:40.370> fall<00:00:40.609> we're

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
that natural force wanting to fall we're

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:42.669 
that natural force wanting to fall we're
going<00:00:41.030> to<00:00:41.089> make<00:00:41.210> sure<00:00:41.449> we<00:00:41.660> don't<00:00:41.809> react<00:00:42.440> to

00:00:42.669 --> 00:00:42.679 
going to make sure we don't react to

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:44.259 
going to make sure we don't react to
that<00:00:42.859> we've<00:00:43.489> got<00:00:43.609> to<00:00:43.699> move<00:00:43.850> it<00:00:44.030> into<00:00:44.149> a

00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:44.269 
that we've got to move it into a

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:46.419 
that we've got to move it into a
position<00:00:44.510> where<00:00:44.960> the<00:00:45.170> club<00:00:45.440> will<00:00:45.620> fall<00:00:45.980> down

00:00:46.419 --> 00:00:46.429 
position where the club will fall down

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:49.869 
position where the club will fall down
and<00:00:46.839> allow<00:00:47.839> us<00:00:48.079> the<00:00:48.350> momentum<00:00:48.499> force<00:00:49.280> to<00:00:49.640> pick

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
and allow us the momentum force to pick

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.049 
and allow us the momentum force to pick
the<00:00:50.149> ball<00:00:50.329> up<00:00:50.390> so<00:00:51.079> a<00:00:51.109> very<00:00:51.379> simple<00:00:51.739> pitch<00:00:52.699> is

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
the ball up so a very simple pitch is

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.270 
the ball up so a very simple pitch is
move<00:00:53.870> the<00:00:54.050> club<00:00:54.260> through<00:00:54.499> position<00:00:55.010> so

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
move the club through position so

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.579 
move the club through position so
there's<00:00:55.489> no<00:00:55.670> real<00:00:56.390> movement<00:00:56.960> in<00:00:57.289> the<00:00:57.379> wrist

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:57.589 
there's no real movement in the wrist

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:00.610 
there's no real movement in the wrist
 until<00:00:58.460> about<00:00:59.030> hip<00:00:59.329> height<00:00:59.569> then<00:01:00.379> the

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
 until about hip height then the

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.619 
 until about hip height then the
wrist<00:01:01.129> now<00:01:01.640> as<00:01:01.850> we<00:01:01.999> come<00:01:02.149> in<00:01:02.300> back<00:01:02.479> and

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
wrist now as we come in back and

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.000 
wrist now as we come in back and
move<00:01:02.780> the<00:01:02.899> club<00:01:03.140> back<00:01:03.350> into<00:01:03.649> this<00:01:03.769> natural

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
move the club back into this natural

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.240 
move the club back into this natural
force<00:01:04.550> where<00:01:05.300> it<00:01:05.479> hung<00:01:06.110> so<00:01:06.770> it's<00:01:06.950> a<00:01:07.040> very

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
force where it hung so it's a very

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.440 
force where it hung so it's a very
simple<00:01:08.090> wrist<00:01:09.040> wrist<00:01:10.040> Hong<00:01:10.340> Kong<00:01:10.640> as

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
simple wrist wrist Hong Kong as

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.200 
simple wrist wrist Hong Kong as
simple<00:01:11.870> as<00:01:11.960> that<00:01:11.990> really<00:01:12.940> pitching<00:01:13.940> could<00:01:14.060> be

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
simple as that really pitching could be

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.210 
simple as that really pitching could be
with<00:01:14.390> a<00:01:14.420> 52<00:01:15.080> or<00:01:15.320> 54<00:01:15.620> or<00:01:16.040> 56<00:01:17.260> and<00:01:18.260> I<00:01:18.890> wanted<00:01:19.130> to

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
with a 52 or 54 or 56 and I wanted to

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.440 
with a 52 or 54 or 56 and I wanted to
explain<00:01:19.660> how<00:01:20.660> we<00:01:20.720> design<00:01:21.940> that<00:01:22.940> particular

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
explain how we design that particular

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.010 
explain how we design that particular
wedge<00:01:23.660> and<00:01:23.990> we<00:01:24.950> we<00:01:25.340> have<00:01:25.610> a<00:01:25.880> positive<00:01:26.720> bounce

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
wedge and we we have a positive bounce

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.650 
wedge and we we have a positive bounce
angle<00:01:27.380> meaning<00:01:27.920> the<00:01:28.040> trailing<00:01:28.340> edge<00:01:28.700> is<00:01:29.000> lower

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
angle meaning the trailing edge is lower

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.960 
angle meaning the trailing edge is lower
than<00:01:29.930> the<00:01:30.050> leading<00:01:30.260> edge<00:01:30.530> if<00:01:31.430> I<00:01:31.580> go<00:01:31.760> like<00:01:31.910> this

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
than the leading edge if I go like this

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.840 
than the leading edge if I go like this
like<00:01:32.210> Peter<00:01:32.660> is<00:01:32.870> addressing<00:01:33.070> the<00:01:34.070> club<00:01:34.340> the

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
like Peter is addressing the club the

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.660 
like Peter is addressing the club the
trailing<00:01:35.270> edge<00:01:35.450> is<00:01:35.480> lower<00:01:35.870> this<00:01:36.650> is<00:01:36.860> the

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
trailing edge is lower this is the

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.230 
trailing edge is lower this is the
shortest<00:01:38.090> club<00:01:38.330> in<00:01:38.510> the<00:01:38.960> bag<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:39.440> wedges<00:01:39.830> and

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
shortest club in the bag the wedges and

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.000 
shortest club in the bag the wedges and
peter<00:01:41.240> is<00:01:41.450> very<00:01:41.690> steep<00:01:42.080> with<00:01:42.410> that<00:01:42.620> with<00:01:42.980> that

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
peter is very steep with that with that

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.820 
peter is very steep with that with that
attack<00:01:43.700> angle<00:01:44.120> and<00:01:44.330> you<00:01:45.110> don't<00:01:45.320> want<00:01:45.560> to<00:01:45.650> hit

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
attack angle and you don't want to hit

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.010 
attack angle and you don't want to hit
the<00:01:46.310> ground<00:01:46.580> with<00:01:47.150> the<00:01:47.330> leading<00:01:47.540> edge<00:01:47.810> you

the ground with the leading edge you

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.380 
the ground with the leading edge you
want<00:01:48.200> to<00:01:48.290> hit<00:01:48.440> it<00:01:48.560> with<00:01:48.680> the<00:01:48.740> sole<00:01:49.100> and<00:01:49.460> because

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
want to hit it with the sole and because

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.700 
want to hit it with the sole and because
of<00:01:50.420> his<00:01:51.830> and<00:01:52.130> the<00:01:52.850> hinge<00:01:53.090> action<00:01:53.660> he<00:01:54.470> gets

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
of his and the hinge action he gets

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.150 
of his and the hinge action he gets
steep<00:01:55.010> away<00:01:55.310> from<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:55.610> ball<00:01:55.820> and<00:01:55.850> comes<00:01:56.330> down

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
steep away from the ball and comes down

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.300 
steep away from the ball and comes down
from<00:01:58.160> from<00:01:58.430> this<00:01:58.640> from<00:01:59.090> this<00:01:59.270> position<00:01:59.450> and

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
from from this from this position and

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.150 
from from this from this position and
uses<00:02:01.310> the<00:02:01.460> sole<00:02:01.670> of<00:02:01.820> the<00:02:01.940> club<00:02:01.970> and<00:02:02.450> this<00:02:03.410> skids

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
uses the sole of the club and this skids

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.280 
uses the sole of the club and this skids
you<00:02:04.700> notice<00:02:05.060> there<00:02:05.240> wasn't<00:02:05.570> any<00:02:05.690> divot<00:02:06.050> airy

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
you notice there wasn't any divot airy

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.009 
you notice there wasn't any divot airy
skidding<00:02:07.190> and<00:02:07.340> hitting<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.209> ball<00:02:08.239> first<00:02:08.720> not

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019 
skidding and hitting the ball first not

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:11.110 
skidding and hitting the ball first not
the<00:02:09.050> big<00:02:09.349> ball<00:02:09.590> not<00:02:09.830> the<00:02:10.009> earth<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:10.819> little

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
the big ball not the earth the little

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.700 
the big ball not the earth the little
ball<00:02:11.269> first<00:02:11.660> and<00:02:11.930> this<00:02:12.650> afterwards

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
ball first and this afterwards

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.220 
ball first and this afterwards
to<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:13.950> ball<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:14.670> that<00:02:14.730> creates<00:02:15.360> spin<00:02:15.930> on<00:02:16.110> the

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
to the ball and that creates spin on the

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.040 
to the ball and that creates spin on the
ball<00:02:16.440> okay<00:02:16.910> creates<00:02:17.910> friction<00:02:18.150> by<00:02:18.810> hitting

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
ball okay creates friction by hitting

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.160 
ball okay creates friction by hitting
down<00:02:19.320> on<00:02:19.530> it<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:19.880> actually<00:02:20.880> bottoms<00:02:21.630> out<00:02:21.840> just

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
down on it and actually bottoms out just

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.830 
down on it and actually bottoms out just
after<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.650> ball
