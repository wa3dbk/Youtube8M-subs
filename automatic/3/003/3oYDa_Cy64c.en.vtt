hit<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:15.059> ramp<00:00:15.269> okay<00:00:16.049> ran<00:00:16.470> on<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.770> rail<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.520> then

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
hit a ramp okay ran on a rail and then

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.570 
hit a ramp okay ran on a rail and then
slide<00:00:18.180> off<00:00:18.210> that<00:00:18.510> rail<00:00:19.250> off<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.369> Grand

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
slide off that rail off the Grand

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.939 
slide off that rail off the Grand
Canyon's<00:00:20.970> yeah<00:00:21.289> every<00:00:22.289> time<00:00:22.439> I<00:00:22.500> think<00:00:22.650> about

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
Canyon's yeah every time I think about

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.700 
Canyon's yeah every time I think about
it<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.430> get<00:00:23.670> this<00:00:23.939> jittery<00:00:24.449> feeling<00:00:24.779> I<00:00:25.560> would

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
it I get this jittery feeling I would

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.140 
it I get this jittery feeling I would
say<00:00:26.010> there's<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.340> riskiest<00:00:26.640> thing<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:27.060> I

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
say there's the riskiest thing that I

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.410 
say there's the riskiest thing that I
ever<00:00:27.180> done

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.420 
ever done

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.080 
ever done
the<00:00:29.110> building<00:00:29.440> process<00:00:29.470> of<00:00:30.010> this<00:00:30.190> ramp<00:00:30.850> and

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 
the building process of this ramp and

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.390 
the building process of this ramp and
this<00:00:31.330> rail<00:00:31.570> is<00:00:31.780> pretty<00:00:32.110> intricate<00:00:32.890> we<00:00:33.250> got

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:33.400 
this rail is pretty intricate we got

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.580 
this rail is pretty intricate we got
these<00:00:33.520> two<00:00:33.580> jiving<00:00:33.940> and<00:00:34.450> they're<00:00:35.110> gonna<00:00:35.230> build

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 
these two jiving and they're gonna build

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.830 
these two jiving and they're gonna build
it<00:00:35.830> and<00:00:36.160> we're<00:00:36.760> gonna<00:00:36.850> push<00:00:37.180> it<00:00:37.360> out

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
it and we're gonna push it out

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.600 
it and we're gonna push it out
I<00:00:37.870> think<00:00:38.380> this<00:00:38.500> rail<00:00:38.740> slide<00:00:39.040> is<00:00:39.160> very<00:00:39.190> crucial

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610 
I think this rail slide is very crucial

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.280 
I think this rail slide is very crucial
because<00:00:39.850> that's<00:00:40.210> gonna<00:00:40.390> give<00:00:40.600> you<00:00:40.720> the<00:00:40.780> speed

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
because that's gonna give you the speed

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.800 
because that's gonna give you the speed
and<00:00:41.590> the<00:00:41.740> distance<00:00:41.950> it<00:00:42.490> took<00:00:42.700> away<00:00:43.150> from<00:00:43.540> that

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:43.810 
and the distance it took away from that

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.780 
and the distance it took away from that
big<00:00:44.200> scary<00:00:44.620> cliff<00:00:45.010> that<00:00:45.550> could<00:00:45.700> potentially

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 
big scary cliff that could potentially

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.840 
big scary cliff that could potentially
break<00:00:46.360> him<00:00:46.600> if<00:00:47.110> he<00:00:47.290> misses<00:00:47.500> the<00:00:47.800> rail<00:00:47.980> and<00:00:48.610> a

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
break him if he misses the rail and a

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.280 
break him if he misses the rail and a
base<00:00:49.030> jump<00:00:49.360> you<00:00:49.450> can't<00:00:49.660> make<00:00:49.809> mistakes<00:00:49.930> like

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
base jump you can't make mistakes like

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.710 
base jump you can't make mistakes like
that<00:00:50.350> I'm<00:00:50.739> not<00:00:50.980> afraid<00:00:51.280> of<00:00:51.309> dying<00:00:51.580> but<00:00:52.239> I<00:00:52.420> love

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
that I'm not afraid of dying but I love

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.560 
that I'm not afraid of dying but I love
living<00:00:53.559> I'll<00:00:53.710> use<00:00:53.860> my<00:00:53.890> fear<00:00:54.400> to<00:00:54.970> keep<00:00:55.180> that<00:00:55.420> in

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
living I'll use my fear to keep that in

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:20.340 
living I'll use my fear to keep that in
check<00:00:55.650> It's<00:00:56.650> Showtime

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.770 

it<00:01:20.590> just<00:01:20.800> scared<00:01:21.220> me<00:01:21.370> you<00:01:21.940> know<00:01:22.270> what<00:01:22.510> out<00:01:22.660> of

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
it just scared me you know what out of

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.810 
it just scared me you know what out of
it<00:01:22.870> looked<00:01:23.260> at<00:01:23.380> me<00:01:23.410> like<00:01:23.680> when<00:01:24.130> he<00:01:24.220> dropped<00:01:24.550> he

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
it looked at me like when he dropped he

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.810 
it looked at me like when he dropped he
was<00:01:25.000> literally<00:01:25.690> above<00:01:26.320> the<00:01:26.920> far<00:01:27.160> wall<00:01:27.460> and<00:01:27.760> I

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
was literally above the far wall and I

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.580 
was literally above the far wall and I
thought<00:01:27.970> oh<00:01:28.030> man<00:01:28.360> he's<00:01:28.480> gonna<00:01:28.630> hit<00:01:28.840> within<00:01:29.170> 200

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
thought oh man he's gonna hit within 200

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.240 
thought oh man he's gonna hit within 200
feet<00:01:29.650> of<00:01:29.830> where<00:01:30.010> he<00:01:30.070> jumped

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
feet of where he jumped
