00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
such a big change to the design that

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.209 
such a big change to the design that
they've<00:00:13.019> gone<00:00:13.230> ahead<00:00:13.380> and<00:00:13.500> changed<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.040> name

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.939 
that you've seen in the fourth
generation<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:21.900> earlier<00:00:22.199> generation<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:22.830> of

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
generation and earlier generation is of

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.040 
generation and earlier generation is of
the<00:00:23.130> iPad<00:00:23.490> but<00:00:24.090> this<00:00:24.269> generation<00:00:24.840> is

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
the iPad but this generation is

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.900 
the iPad but this generation is
critically<00:00:25.560> twenty<00:00:25.949> percent<00:00:26.250> thinner<00:00:26.609> and

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
critically twenty percent thinner and

critically twenty percent thinner and
forty<00:00:27.630> percent<00:00:27.990> lighter<00:00:28.320> that<00:00:29.189> may<00:00:29.310> not<00:00:29.340> sound

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
forty percent lighter that may not sound

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.429 
forty percent lighter that may not sound
like<00:00:30.000> big<00:00:30.390> numbers<00:00:30.750> but<00:00:30.929> actually<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.410> a

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
like big numbers but actually it is a

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.350 
like big numbers but actually it is a
very<00:00:31.710> noticeable<00:00:32.219> difference<00:00:32.579> when<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.180> pick

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
very noticeable difference when you pick

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.360 
very noticeable difference when you pick
up<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.660> hold<00:00:33.840> this<00:00:34.020> tablet<00:00:34.530> it's<00:00:34.710> incredibly

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
up and hold this tablet it's incredibly

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.310 
up and hold this tablet it's incredibly
light<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.880> incredibly<00:00:36.329> thin<00:00:36.570> much<00:00:36.809> more<00:00:37.079> so

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
light and incredibly thin much more so

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.290 
light and incredibly thin much more so
than<00:00:37.469> before<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:38.430> really<00:00:38.579> feels<00:00:38.760> great<00:00:39.059> much

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
than before it really feels great much

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.750 
than before it really feels great much
more<00:00:39.660> close<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.320> ipad<00:00:40.590> mini<00:00:40.649> than<00:00:41.460> indeed

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
more close to the ipad mini than indeed

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.920 
more close to the ipad mini than indeed
to<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.030> fourth<00:00:42.239> generation<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:42.870> the

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
to the fourth generation and the

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
before it has the a7 processor which we

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.130 
before it has the a7 processor which we
just<00:00:47.340> saw<00:00:47.430> introduced<00:00:47.940> in<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.180> iphone<00:00:48.539> 5s

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
just saw introduced in the iphone 5s

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.350 
just saw introduced in the iphone 5s
which<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.500> 64-bit<00:00:50.309> chip<00:00:50.610> which<00:00:51.120> gives

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
which is a 64-bit chip which gives

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.760 
which is a 64-bit chip which gives
really<00:00:51.660> great<00:00:51.930> performance<00:00:52.530> we've<00:00:52.620> actually

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
really great performance we've actually

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.529 
really great performance we've actually
seen<00:00:53.100> noticeable<00:00:53.610> improvements<00:00:54.270> over<00:00:54.360> the

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
seen noticeable improvements over the

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.240 
seen noticeable improvements over the
fourth-generation<00:00:55.050> ipad<00:00:55.649> which<00:00:55.829> itself<00:00:56.160> was

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
fourth-generation ipad which itself was

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.580 
fourth-generation ipad which itself was
quite<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.670> performer<00:00:57.300> games<00:00:57.899> will<00:00:58.109> run<00:00:58.289> really

it's<00:01:06.420> not<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.600> huge<00:01:06.869> difference<00:01:07.140> from<00:01:07.380> the

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
it's not a huge difference from the

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.289 
it's not a huge difference from the
previous<00:01:07.530> generation<00:01:08.310> interestingly<00:01:08.909> this

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
previous generation interestingly this

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.060 
previous generation interestingly this
is<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.570> same<00:01:09.810> cpu<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.500> found<00:01:10.740> in<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.950> iPhone

this is the same version benchmarks
prove<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.280> be<00:01:17.400> about<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.759> same<00:01:17.909> speed<00:01:18.330> as

the iPhone 5s that's not a bad thing by
any<00:01:20.880> means<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.180> 5s<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.720> indeed<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.020> very<00:01:22.080> quick

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
any means the 5s is indeed a very quick

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.109 
any means the 5s is indeed a very quick
phone<00:01:22.740> but<00:01:23.340> if<00:01:23.430> you're<00:01:23.549> hoping<00:01:23.790> for<00:01:23.850> something

phone but if you're hoping for something
even<00:01:24.330> quicker<00:01:24.659> you're<00:01:25.259> not<00:01:25.380> going<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.619> see

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
even quicker you're not going to see

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.710 
even quicker you're not going to see
that<00:01:25.830> here<00:01:26.430> now<00:01:27.210> we've<00:01:27.330> got<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.540> same

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
that here now we've got the same

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.240 
that here now we've got the same
selection<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.259> ports<00:01:28.590> as<00:01:28.740> before<00:01:29.070> which<00:01:29.189> is

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
selection of ports as before which is

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.770 
selection of ports as before which is
basically<00:01:29.640> just<00:01:29.759> one<00:01:30.090> port<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.479> Lightning

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
basically just one port the Lightning

basically just one port the Lightning
port<00:01:30.930> on<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.229> bottom<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.799> device<00:01:31.950> we<00:01:32.549> do

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
port on the bottom of the device we do

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.490

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
for the ipad air and that is the ipad

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.229 
for the ipad air and that is the ipad
mini<00:03:00.319> retina<00:03:00.409> which<00:03:00.950> apple<00:03:01.370> also<00:03:01.519> introduced

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
mini retina which apple also introduced

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:04.599 
mini retina which apple also introduced
the<00:03:02.810> ipad<00:03:03.139> mini<00:03:03.439> retina<00:03:03.709> doesn't<00:03:04.129> come<00:03:04.430> to<00:03:04.519> the

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.609 
the ipad mini retina doesn't come to the

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:06.369 
the ipad mini retina doesn't come to the
market<00:03:04.790> until<00:03:05.090> a<00:03:05.150> little<00:03:05.359> bit<00:03:05.510> after<00:03:05.689> the<00:03:05.959> ipad

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
market until a little bit after the ipad

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:08.679 
market until a little bit after the ipad
air<00:03:06.590> but<00:03:07.159> with<00:03:07.310> the<00:03:07.430> retina<00:03:07.730> display<00:03:08.060> and<00:03:08.299> also

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:08.689 
air but with the retina display and also

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:11.170 
air but with the retina display and also
the<00:03:08.870> a7<00:03:09.379> processor<00:03:09.530> inside<00:03:10.280> we<00:03:10.909> think<00:03:11.150> that

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
the a7 processor inside we think that

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.670 
the a7 processor inside we think that
apple's<00:03:11.659> got<00:03:11.810> more<00:03:12.079> competition<00:03:12.530> on<00:03:12.620> the

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
apple's got more competition on the

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.500 
apple's got more competition on the
inside<00:03:13.040> than<00:03:13.579> it<00:03:13.639> does<00:03:13.819> on<00:03:13.849> the<00:03:14.000> outside<00:03:14.389> of

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
inside than it does on the outside of

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.569 
inside than it does on the outside of
the<00:03:14.569> market<00:03:14.870> right<00:03:15.019> now<00:03:15.160> overall<00:03:16.160> again<00:03:16.430> we're

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
the market right now overall again we're

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:18.099 
the market right now overall again we're
really<00:03:16.730> happy<00:03:16.970> with<00:03:17.180> the<00:03:17.269> iPad<00:03:17.629> air<00:03:17.840> we<00:03:17.959> think

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
really happy with the iPad air we think

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:19.240 
really happy with the iPad air we think
it's<00:03:18.230> a<00:03:18.260> great<00:03:18.379> tablet<00:03:18.709> if<00:03:19.010> you've<00:03:19.160> been

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
it's a great tablet if you've been

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.830 
it's a great tablet if you've been
waiting<00:03:19.459> for<00:03:19.639> an<00:03:19.849> upgrade<00:03:20.000> I<00:03:20.239> think<00:03:20.510> now<00:03:20.660> is

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
waiting for an upgrade I think now is

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.869 
waiting for an upgrade I think now is
probably<00:03:21.079> the<00:03:21.470> time<00:03:21.650> to<00:03:21.829> do<00:03:21.980> so<00:03:22.220> but<00:03:22.699> if<00:03:22.790> you've

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:22.879 
probably the time to do so but if you've

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:24.280 
probably the time to do so but if you've
got<00:03:23.000> a<00:03:23.030> fourth-generation<00:03:23.359> iPad<00:03:24.139> the

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
got a fourth-generation iPad the

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.479 
got a fourth-generation iPad the
performance<00:03:24.739> difference<00:03:25.010> isn't<00:03:25.190> all<00:03:25.459> that

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
performance difference isn't all that

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.520 
performance difference isn't all that
drastic<00:03:26.209> unless<00:03:26.780> you're<00:03:26.959> really<00:03:27.139> looking<00:03:27.260> for

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
drastic unless you're really looking for

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.020 
drastic unless you're really looking for
something<00:03:27.769> thinner<00:03:28.010> and<00:03:28.190> lighter<00:03:28.340> we<00:03:28.849> think

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
something thinner and lighter we think

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.250 
something thinner and lighter we think
you'll<00:03:29.120> probably<00:03:29.299> be<00:03:29.599> happy<00:03:29.900> to<00:03:29.989> stick<00:03:30.139> with

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
you'll probably be happy to stick with

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.990 
you'll probably be happy to stick with
that<00:03:30.349> for<00:03:30.409> at<00:03:30.650> least<00:03:30.709> another<00:03:30.919> year<00:03:31.099> again

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
that for at least another year again

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.189 
that for at least another year again
