00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.650
 inti pestons and victories of the ambrÃ¬ in 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.540
 first derby of the season your first 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.900
 goal of the season we can say that yes 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.830
 is unlocked a bit finally yes but I think 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.259
 that the team made one today 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.940
 great job 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.859
 especially the boys playing in 4 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.900
 against 5 because we know against Lugano 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.490
 that always difficult and they really have 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.310
 held up well twice today against 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.980
 3 then the victory battery goes 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.340
 them as much as I did my first 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.769
 goal I'm happy for this but I don't have to 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.510
 think only of myself and make a joke 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.460
 where to go to the whole team 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.230
 results come to come as mentioned 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.700
 head there is one thing but you have to 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.559
 penalties are ready to improve 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.480
 some even taken in phase 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.920
 a bit stupid attack this is one 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.320
 what you need to improve pre we can 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.600
 yes we have taken lots of matches 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.910
 quality against a lugano who 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.430
 we know we don't have to take them but 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.730
 maybe redone, maybe some skate 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.140
 more 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.520
 we are tired without using too much 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.829
 stick because most of the 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.750
 shades come between little hooks 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.850
 so too for absurd the phases in 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.890
 boxplay were the ones he gave me 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.540
 more strength because you and always is 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.220
 exceeded quite well 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.750
 the first powerplay was deadly 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.040
 so let's say that special teams 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.979
 year they played in your favor 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.560
 tonight yes yes powerplay have made two 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.409
 goal so I think it's fine though 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.509
 well we can't always speculate like this 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.670
 because we saw their first power 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.380
 actively dangerous players and a 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.000
 player as metropÃ²li domenichelli 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.829
 so you can always take goals a moment 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.630
 to the other so it would be better not 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.610
 take it all and play it 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.259
 powerplay that helps us get started 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.729
 sampled for the tits put in the 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.079
 same line of last year is had 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.119
 a bit of difficulty 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.000
 now from Saturday and games with park and 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.290
 giroux do you think you found 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.659
 the right balance with this line 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.030
 if last year also last year 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.579
 shot enough in seven with a thousand 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.549
 riker then changed to straight after faith 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.430
 every foreign now coach must 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.900
 always try the lines a little now 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.880
 I feel good with these two I am 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.620
 well even with mirko yes but not 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.430
 they were able to score now 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.140
 changed it's pretty good so I want to 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.010
 I feel good with everyone anyway I have to 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.740
 do what the coach tells me 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.140
 john any player but point bar 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:15.230
 with park and ride they help me a lot 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.120
 that when they saw that it was there anyway 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.490
 so many people told me, and you do not sign here 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.170
 from there they helped me a lot to say 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.000
 bondi just think about what's there 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.870
 team don't get caught up in the 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.350
 comments 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.030
 the goals arrive will do it in the last few 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.590
 two games despite the absence of 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.230
 an hour from the team played anyway 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.400
 well and scraping four points from the 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.930
 next game there will be a new one 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.060
 foreigner in defense 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.590
 felt like a need for a hand in 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:44.180
 this sense or according to you the 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.860
 team was already going well so that one 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.350
 most foreigner can always help the 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.660
 attack defense team that is a 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.730
 defender especially now that the 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.980
 they are out could give us a great deal 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.120
 hand but we lost without player 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.830
 more important than the team seen 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.900
 what he does both forward and backward 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.390
 and now I see that the team has reacted 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.980
 well reacted well to this ugly 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.140
 injury we also won parity 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.030
 for him because he was very strong 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.130
 even when it's training and now 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.510
 we will play with each other in the first 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.610
 five games you got three 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.860
 wins in four you have scored points in 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.420
 less than that could not be started 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.730
 I think few expected it starts 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.470
 this way but also ourselves now 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.480
 we believe in ourselves we know that 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.610
 we can go and win at any 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.870
 track Friday we will go to bern with the 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.850
 same mentality that we can win 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.739
 not to wait but to do ours 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.549
 I think this game if the thing that goes 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.549
 better than constantins
