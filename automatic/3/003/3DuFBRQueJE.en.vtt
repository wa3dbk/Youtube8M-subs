collage<00:00:11.940> paper<00:00:12.509> so<00:00:13.080> jelly<00:00:13.950> plates<00:00:14.219> all<00:00:14.429> come

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
collage paper so jelly plates all come

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.120 
collage paper so jelly plates all come
in<00:00:14.849> this<00:00:15.000> clamshell<00:00:15.420> packaging<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:16.680> you<00:00:16.740> just

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
in this clamshell packaging and you just

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.130 
in this clamshell packaging and you just
pull<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:17.460> open<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.480> jelly<00:00:18.690> plate<00:00:18.960> is

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
pull it open and the jelly plate is

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.560 
pull it open and the jelly plate is
sandwiched<00:00:19.500> between<00:00:19.560> two<00:00:19.770> sheets<00:00:20.160> of<00:00:20.340> acetate

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
sandwiched between two sheets of acetate

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.240 
sandwiched between two sheets of acetate
so<00:00:21.570> you<00:00:21.630> remove<00:00:22.170> those<00:00:22.380> sheets<00:00:22.619> but<00:00:22.830> keep<00:00:23.039> them

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
so you remove those sheets but keep them

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.710 
so you remove those sheets but keep them
because<00:00:23.609> you<00:00:23.699> want<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:23.939> store<00:00:24.269> it<00:00:24.359> in<00:00:24.449> it<00:00:24.600> as

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
because you want to store it in it as

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.720 
because you want to store it in it as
you<00:00:24.840> can<00:00:24.930> see<00:00:25.109> my<00:00:25.289> plate<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.710> used<00:00:25.740> but<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.490> keep

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
you can see my plate is used but I keep

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.880 
you can see my plate is used but I keep
it<00:00:26.849> stored<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.390> way<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.900> then<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.650> really

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
it stored that way and then the really

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.349 
it stored that way and then the really
cool<00:00:29.070> thing<00:00:29.340> about<00:00:29.369> jelly<00:00:29.820> plates<00:00:30.060> is<00:00:30.210> they'll

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
cool thing about jelly plates is they'll

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.410 
cool thing about jelly plates is they'll
actually<00:00:30.390> stick<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.439> acrylic<00:00:31.740> blocks<00:00:32.270> so<00:00:33.270> this

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
actually stick to acrylic blocks so this

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.330 
actually stick to acrylic blocks so this
is<00:00:33.540> an<00:00:33.630> acrylic<00:00:33.840> stamping<00:00:34.590> block<00:00:34.800> from<00:00:35.130> Tim

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
is an acrylic stamping block from Tim

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.130 
is an acrylic stamping block from Tim
Holtz<00:00:35.520> very<00:00:35.910> thin<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:36.780> can<00:00:36.899> see<00:00:36.989> that

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
Holtz very thin and you can see that

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.350 
Holtz very thin and you can see that
four<00:00:37.350> inch<00:00:37.559> block<00:00:38.100> just<00:00:38.370> hangs<00:00:38.670> right<00:00:39.149> on

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
four inch block just hangs right on

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.850 
four inch block just hangs right on
there<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:39.690> basically<00:00:40.050> what<00:00:40.290> we<00:00:40.410> have<00:00:40.440> is<00:00:40.770> a

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
there so basically what we have is a

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.850 
there so basically what we have is a
blank<00:00:41.700> canvas<00:00:42.290> stamp<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.530> guess<00:00:43.680> that's<00:00:43.829> the

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
blank canvas stamp I guess that's the

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.020 
blank canvas stamp I guess that's the
way<00:00:43.980> I'm<00:00:44.100> thinking<00:00:44.219> about<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:44.879> we're

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
way I'm thinking about it and so we're

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.440 
way I'm thinking about it and so we're
gonna<00:00:45.120> be<00:00:45.329> using<00:00:45.510> stamps<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.500> create<00:00:47.210> well<00:00:48.210> new

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
gonna be using stamps to create well new

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.029 
gonna be using stamps to create well new
designs<00:00:48.780> so<00:00:48.989> I'm<00:00:49.110> using<00:00:49.289> these<00:00:49.469> are<00:00:49.620> my<00:00:49.800> balls

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
designs so I'm using these are my balls

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.619 
designs so I'm using these are my balls
or<00:00:50.160> design<00:00:50.399> stamps<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.059> they're<00:00:51.360> from

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
or design stamps and they're from

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.319 
or design stamps and they're from
impression<00:00:52.110> obsession<00:00:52.579> they're<00:00:53.579> unmounted

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
impression obsession they're unmounted

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.240 
impression obsession they're unmounted
rubber<00:00:54.570> which<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:54.960> perfect<00:00:55.559> for<00:00:55.649> using<00:00:55.980> with

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
rubber which is perfect for using with

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.560 
rubber which is perfect for using with
paint<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.699> they're<00:00:56.940> all<00:00:57.090> based<00:00:57.390> on

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
paint and they're all based on

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.540 
paint and they're all based on
hand-carved<00:00:58.350> stamps<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.829> I've<00:00:58.949> made<00:00:59.160> and

onto the paper that I have sitting on
the

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
the

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.380 
the
table<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.129> this<00:02:14.250> is<00:02:14.370> how<00:02:14.519> I<00:02:14.549> actually<00:02:14.909> make

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
table and this is how I actually make

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.869 
table and this is how I actually make
several<00:02:15.750> pieces<00:02:16.019> of<00:02:16.260> collage<00:02:16.590> paper<00:02:16.950> when<00:02:17.730> I'm

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
several pieces of collage paper when I'm

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.670 
several pieces of collage paper when I'm
making<00:02:18.090> collage<00:02:18.569> paper<00:02:18.840> because<00:02:19.319> all<00:02:19.530> that

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
making collage paper because all that

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.990 
making collage paper because all that
paper<00:02:19.920> that<00:02:20.129> you're<00:02:20.250> rubbing<00:02:20.610> your<00:02:20.640> brayer

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
paper that you're rubbing your brayer

paper that you're rubbing your brayer
off<00:02:21.239> onto<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.750> cleaning<00:02:22.110> can<00:02:22.319> become

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
off onto and cleaning can become

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.130 
off onto and cleaning can become
something<00:02:23.040> now<00:02:23.340> a<00:02:23.640> stamp<00:02:24.209> with<00:02:24.329> a<00:02:24.360> more<00:02:24.689> bold

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
something now a stamp with a more bold

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.080 
something now a stamp with a more bold
design<00:02:25.590> like<00:02:25.860> this<00:02:26.010> one<00:02:26.250> tends<00:02:26.549> to<00:02:26.730> work<00:02:26.879> a

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
design like this one tends to work a

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.539 
design like this one tends to work a
little<00:02:27.269> bit<00:02:27.629> better<00:02:28.159> you'll<00:02:29.159> see<00:02:29.400> in<00:02:29.489> the

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
little bit better you'll see in the

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.280 
little bit better you'll see in the
video<00:02:29.760> that<00:02:29.819> I<00:02:30.060> do<00:02:30.180> use<00:02:30.659> some<00:02:30.689> stamps<00:02:31.170> that<00:02:31.200> are

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
video that I do use some stamps that are

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.920 
video that I do use some stamps that are
a<00:02:31.379> thinner<00:02:32.060> finer<00:02:33.060> design<00:02:33.510> but<00:02:33.689> they<00:02:33.750> don't

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
a thinner finer design but they don't

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.809 
a thinner finer design but they don't
work<00:02:34.109> as<00:02:34.349> well<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:34.799> then<00:02:35.220> when<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:35.489> have<00:02:35.670> your

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
work as well and then when you have your

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.149 
work as well and then when you have your
sample<00:02:36.569> painted<00:02:37.140> you're<00:02:37.290> gonna<00:02:37.379> stamp<00:02:37.799> it<00:02:37.980> off

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
sample painted you're gonna stamp it off

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:39.500 
sample painted you're gonna stamp it off
and<00:02:38.400> you<00:02:38.459> can<00:02:38.549> see<00:02:38.609> it<00:02:38.790> there<00:02:38.939> on<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.090> black<00:02:39.329> so

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
and you can see it there on the black so

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.569 
and you can see it there on the black so
again<00:02:39.840> an<00:02:40.140> easy<00:02:40.439> way<00:02:40.680> to<00:02:40.739> create<00:02:40.950> extra

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
again an easy way to create extra

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:43.429 
again an easy way to create extra
collage<00:02:41.879> paper<00:02:42.090> as<00:02:42.390> you're<00:02:42.629> working<00:02:43.019> is<00:02:43.230> to

collage paper as you're working is to

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:45.080 
collage paper as you're working is to
stamp<00:02:43.799> it<00:02:43.980> off<00:02:44.129> if<00:02:44.400> I<00:02:44.519> had<00:02:44.549> a<00:02:44.700> colored

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
stamp it off if I had a colored

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.819 
stamp it off if I had a colored
background<00:02:45.329> or<00:02:45.780> something<00:02:46.019> like<00:02:46.139> that<00:02:46.200> it'll

white stamps on it

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:53.180 
white stamps on it
I<00:02:49.859> am<00:02:50.639> stamping<00:02:51.120> all<00:02:51.299> around<00:02:51.959> on<00:02:52.379> my<00:02:52.620> block<00:02:52.859> and

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
I am stamping all around on my block and

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.750 
I am stamping all around on my block and
then<00:02:54.290> making<00:02:55.290> sure<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:55.650> go<00:02:55.769> off<00:02:55.889> the<00:02:56.069> edges<00:02:56.250> of

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
then making sure to go off the edges of

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.729 
then making sure to go off the edges of
course<00:02:57.060> so<00:02:57.299> that<00:02:57.329> it<00:02:57.569> looks<00:02:57.780> like<00:02:57.840> a<00:02:57.989> full

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
course so that it looks like a full

course so that it looks like a full
design<00:02:58.950> I<00:02:59.489> also<00:03:00.120> am<00:03:00.629> going<00:03:00.720> to<00:03:01.139> add<00:03:01.290> in<00:03:01.530> a

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.670 
design I also am going to add in a
second<00:03:02.040> stamp<00:03:02.280> this<00:03:02.489> is<00:03:02.639> just<00:03:02.849> a<00:03:02.939> little<00:03:03.180> X

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
you can see I'm using pressure

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.379 
you can see I'm using pressure
especially<00:03:52.979> with<00:03:53.129> the<00:03:53.220> second<00:03:53.790> print<00:03:54.030> I<00:03:54.180> put

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
especially with the second print I put

especially with the second print I put
my<00:03:54.510> body<00:03:54.780> weight<00:03:55.079> behind<00:03:55.319> it<00:03:55.739> and<00:03:56.040> I<00:03:56.190> really

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
my body weight behind it and I really

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.580 
my body weight behind it and I really
push<00:03:56.790> down<00:03:57.090> and<00:03:57.419> then<00:03:57.930> you<00:03:58.079> can<00:03:58.229> clean<00:03:58.440> that

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
push down and then you can clean that

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.469 
push down and then you can clean that
plate<00:03:58.859> if<00:03:58.979> you<00:03:59.069> want<00:03:59.340> you<00:03:59.669> can<00:03:59.790> stamp<00:04:00.120> it<00:04:00.329> off

whatever you want to do but basically

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.129 
whatever you want to do but basically
I'm<00:04:02.489> just<00:04:02.519> gonna<00:04:02.819> keep<00:04:03.180> going<00:04:03.629> in<00:04:03.870> this

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:04.139 
I'm just gonna keep going in this

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:08.180 
I'm just gonna keep going in this
fashion<00:04:04.669> adding<00:04:05.669> paint<00:04:06.209> and<00:04:06.720> you<00:04:07.709> choosing

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
fashion adding paint and you choosing

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.490 
fashion adding paint and you choosing
various<00:04:08.549> stamps<00:04:09.269> and<00:04:09.479> creating<00:04:09.930> sort<00:04:10.109> of<00:04:10.199> new

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
various stamps and creating sort of new

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.559 
various stamps and creating sort of new
designs<00:04:10.919> from<00:04:11.190> the<00:04:11.340> stamps<00:04:11.669> I<00:04:11.760> already<00:04:12.090> have<00:04:12.299> I

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
designs from the stamps I already have I

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.629 
designs from the stamps I already have I
really<00:04:12.810> like<00:04:13.199> this<00:04:13.409> technique<00:04:13.650> as<00:04:13.949> a<00:04:14.010> way<00:04:14.609> of

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:14.639 
really like this technique as a way of

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:16.759 
really like this technique as a way of
personalizing<00:04:15.510> the<00:04:15.959> things<00:04:16.199> that<00:04:16.440> you<00:04:16.530> have

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
personalizing the things that you have

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.920 
personalizing the things that you have
you<00:04:17.010> know<00:04:17.130> I'm<00:04:17.250> all<00:04:17.459> about<00:04:17.630> personal<00:04:18.630> style

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
you know I'm all about personal style

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.599 
you know I'm all about personal style
and<00:04:19.169> really<00:04:19.289> making<00:04:19.709> your<00:04:19.829> own<00:04:19.859> statement<00:04:20.459> and

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
and really making your own statement and

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.330 
and really making your own statement and
when<00:04:20.849> you<00:04:21.440> take<00:04:22.440> what<00:04:22.680> you<00:04:22.830> have<00:04:22.979> the<00:04:23.099> tools

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
when you take what you have the tools

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.129 
when you take what you have the tools
that<00:04:23.490> you<00:04:23.550> have<00:04:23.580> and<00:04:23.909> transform<00:04:24.510> them<00:04:24.779> in<00:04:24.900> some

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
that you have and transform them in some

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:26.659 
that you have and transform them in some
way<00:04:25.289> I<00:04:25.320> just<00:04:25.529> think<00:04:25.800> it<00:04:25.860> makes<00:04:26.010> it<00:04:26.190> so<00:04:26.490> much

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
way I just think it makes it so much

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:27.290 
way I just think it makes it so much
more

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
more

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.820 
more
so<00:04:27.449> this<00:04:27.569> is<00:04:27.690> a<00:04:27.720> way<00:04:27.870> of<00:04:27.900> taking<00:04:28.319> your<00:04:28.440> stamps

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
so this is a way of taking your stamps

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.159 
so this is a way of taking your stamps
and<00:04:28.979> just<00:04:29.400> making<00:04:29.580> them<00:04:29.819> even<00:04:30.030> more<00:04:30.629> your<00:04:31.139> own

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
and just making them even more your own

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.110 
and just making them even more your own
now<00:04:31.770> of<00:04:31.860> course<00:04:32.069> you<00:04:32.220> could<00:04:32.400> do<00:04:32.490> this<00:04:32.610> in<00:04:32.789> color

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
now of course you could do this in color

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.999 
now of course you could do this in color
you<00:04:34.050> could<00:04:34.199> do<00:04:34.319> it<00:04:34.440> a<00:04:34.500> lot<00:04:34.650> of<00:04:34.740> different<00:04:34.949> ways

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:35.009 
you could do it a lot of different ways

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:36.950 
you could do it a lot of different ways
I<00:04:35.220> just<00:04:35.250> happen<00:04:35.789> to<00:04:35.879> be<00:04:36.000> obsessed<00:04:36.449> with<00:04:36.750> black

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
I just happen to be obsessed with black

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:37.969 
I just happen to be obsessed with black
and<00:04:37.199> white<00:04:37.229> a<00:04:37.319> little<00:04:37.560> bit<00:04:37.680> right<00:04:37.919> now

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
and white a little bit right now

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:39.770 
and white a little bit right now
partially<00:04:38.580> because<00:04:38.970> I<00:04:39.060> think<00:04:39.120> I<00:04:39.270> work<00:04:39.479> in<00:04:39.629> so

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
partially because I think I work in so

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.300 
partially because I think I work in so
much<00:04:39.930> color<00:04:40.139> that<00:04:40.620> black<00:04:40.800> and<00:04:41.009> white<00:04:41.129> is<00:04:41.280> a

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
much color that black and white is a

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.040 
much color that black and white is a
great<00:04:41.639> contrast<00:04:42.120> and<00:04:42.270> again<00:04:42.569> that's

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
great contrast and again that's

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.930 
great contrast and again that's
collaging<00:04:43.710> different<00:04:44.250> stamp<00:04:44.610> designs

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
collaging different stamp designs

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.059 
collaging different stamp designs
together<00:04:45.389> for<00:04:45.780> a<00:04:45.810> kind<00:04:46.080> of<00:04:46.169> really<00:04:46.650> cool

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:47.069 
together for a kind of really cool
