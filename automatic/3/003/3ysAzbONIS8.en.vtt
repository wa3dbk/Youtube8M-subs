00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.320
 did not wake up already the college was avoided 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.380
 because today is the day to put the video on 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.750
 content video channel and then I left 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.960

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.750
 There's no video on the channel. 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:45.860
 I went to see we were with 1% loaded 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:50.840
 the video and one full night of 1% 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:54.040
 I got to sleep and I did not see the 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.230
 Entirely I went there from anyone a modem 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.930
 reconnect and is now loading at 13% 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:03.050
 but imagine how angry I was 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.900
 because it's the fault of the internet and as always 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.070
 The guy comes here and says that everything is 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.989
 normal 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.810
 We are not always sure that the 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:14.030
 internet at the time catching complicated 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.190
 very complicated and today I was going to record a 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.870
 bedroom decor video but my 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.519

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.180

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:41.180

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.970
