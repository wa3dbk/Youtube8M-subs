00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:06.160
 hello friends let's go there a new game 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:09.400
 for the online chess channel 12 of 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:13.660
 June 2012 already started as you see me 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:16.630
 I wear the white pieces I played a great 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:20.050
 teacher I do not know him very well but 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.329
 good is a great chess master here 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:26.739
 I'm going to play extra structures and so that 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:30.160
 know her a little 3 my plan 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:33.960
 it is played on a horse basis of 2 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.739
 g3 g2 c4 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:41.360
 that's my plan let's see if I can 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.360
 develop it in this game 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:48.160
 the g24 horse c3 these are my plays 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:55.660
 so it's good that 5 h is normal for 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:58.870
 do h 4 and bother not to let me castle 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:04.320
 short but I'll go to the long castling 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:06.960
 in this case since he reacts 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.869
 with ax 5 and 4 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.240
 Well, I'm going quickly to castling 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.220
 long 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.820
 and I will try to play in the center 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.880
 with efe 3 and 4 I have several others 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.190
 plans in this position but good and 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.450
 that has not developed much I'll go to 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.670
 play in the center 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.659
 always keep in mind this that can 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:34.009
 be a good strategy 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.009
 play in the center 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.409
 if the rival is not very developed 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.640
 well here I go and good here 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.690
 example gentleman c4 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.920
 they give a pawn 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:53.009
 although he has a reaction with g5 and g4 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.380
 but I 'm going to see why it's not 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.479
 that this is not very developed 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:02.490
 so it's going to valley c4 to eat me 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:04.939
 the h3 pawn and with suit 4 I'm going to 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.939
 change 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.540
 and horse f4 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.890
 g4 change first because if not yes no 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:21.030
 change first he would put a pawn in f3 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.030
 that could be annoying 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.400
 and I would give you important boxes like this is 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.400
 what I eat 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:32.730
 and after horse f4 I'm going to do 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:36.989
 good if you eat horse I think about it 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:40.560
 I would obviously make another play but 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:43.230
 good pawn for horse efe 4 and good with 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.750
 that play I think the center gives me 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.140
 I'm going to do 4 and 5 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.630
 good let's leave 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.050
 The truth is that I think I 'm staying 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:56.620
 in a very good position because bishop 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.810
 g24 5 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:03.549
 I think he has problems let's see 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.990
 he is castling I'm going to do 4 yh 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:10.620
 3 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:10.620
 of 45 maybe first 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:17.020
 5 if I like 5 now because after 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:20.710
 bishop and 4 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:23.560
 I change his white bishop what 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:29.260
 who is defending his castling like this is 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:31.570
 that to file 4 and then h 3 and I think 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.090
 well I prepare to eat n 4 in case 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:37.150
 they change if he does not change he will eat me 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.870
 at night 7 so I get ready to 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.209
 eat in 4 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.659
 it's a fast game as you know to 5 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.659
 minutes 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.170
 and then I'm going to do h3 so that's 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.880
 is my simple plan the truth is that 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.130
 I think he has come a long way in the 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.730
 attack 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.730
 it has overtaken me 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.890
 and black women the truth is that they have not 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.319
 started no 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:07.160
 no good reaction has not eaten like this 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:10.650
 is that like me in h7 this will give me 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:14.100
 time for when to the h 3 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:16.920
 maybe I will do horse 4 first 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:20.040
 because because I do not see good box for 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:24.230
 your ladies and ladies f5 who is the only one who 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:30.570
 I am attacked by the horse I have a horse of 6 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:34.620
 followed by h3 and good winning I think is my 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:37.409
 opinion that if we give f5 horse yes and yes 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:43.639
 then I like it more than h 3 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:43.639
 yes lady f5 horse of 6 followed by h 3 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.060
 the truth is that I think I'm going to give 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:51.090
 tomato 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:54.260
 let's see if the lady goes somewhere else 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:05:00.440
 other than f5 to other reasonable sites 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:03.730
 I do h3 and I have an attack I think 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.730
 then mate attack 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:10.129
 or win some kind of material I have 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:13.110
 many plays good indeed has 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:15.900
 abandoned good 10 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:19.470
 I think it is not a criticizable decision 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:22.010
 leave because good to see the game 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.010
 How has it been 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.340
 I do not know for example if we give h 6 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:33.240
 h 3 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:38.190
 if we give is 7 h 3 if we give f 5 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:41.320
 horse of 6 followed by h 3 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:43.690
 opening the column of h 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:47.260
 and this would surely end up in some 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:49.529
 mate or gain of material I do not know anything 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:54.179
 more 7 

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:58.919
 yes lady f5 horse 6 and then h3 well 

00:05:54.179 --> 00:06:02.509
 is that nothing and yes lady because the 7th lady 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:02.509
 8 h 3 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:08.230
 and the truth is that yes, that is 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.820
 Black is lost so thank you 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:12.720
 friends a new game of chess
