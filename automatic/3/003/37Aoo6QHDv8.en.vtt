issues with this why I'm returning it

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.900 
issues with this why I'm returning it
first<00:00:22.050> of<00:00:22.230> all<00:00:22.439> this<00:00:22.800> thing<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:23.519> was<00:00:23.640> an<00:00:23.789> issue

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
first of all this thing it was an issue

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.279 
first of all this thing it was an issue
with<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.210> older<00:00:24.570> version<00:00:24.600> as<00:00:25.019> well

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
with the older version as well

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.839 
with the older version as well
this<00:00:25.560> thing<00:00:25.740> comes<00:00:25.949> on<00:00:26.070> done<00:00:26.250> on<00:00:26.340> its<00:00:26.490> own<00:00:26.670> and

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
this thing comes on done on its own and

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.529 
this thing comes on done on its own and
it's<00:00:27.570> too<00:00:28.109> short<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:29.220> actually<00:00:29.269> really<00:00:30.269> nicely

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
it's too short to actually really nicely

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.780 
it's too short to actually really nicely
grip<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.289> just<00:00:31.980> find<00:00:32.160> that<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.399> just<00:00:32.430> sort<00:00:32.730> of

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
grip it I just find that it just sort of

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.340 
grip it I just find that it just sort of
gets<00:00:33.420> in<00:00:33.510> my<00:00:33.660> way<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:33.960> its<00:00:34.050> really<00:00:34.110> annoying

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
gets in my way and its really annoying

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.959 
gets in my way and its really annoying
and<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.649> don't<00:00:34.710> use<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.430> sucks

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
and I don't use it and it sucks

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.520 
and I don't use it and it sucks
it<00:00:36.210> looks<00:00:36.450> nice<00:00:36.930> but<00:00:37.079> I<00:00:37.110> just<00:00:37.260> really<00:00:37.440> don't

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
it looks nice but I just really don't

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.470 
it looks nice but I just really don't
like<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.860> design<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.160> it

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
like the design of it

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.290 
like the design of it
secondly<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:40.890> has<00:00:41.160> been<00:00:41.309> redesigned<00:00:41.640> the

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
secondly this has been redesigned the

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.030 
secondly this has been redesigned the
older<00:00:42.600> version<00:00:42.930> this<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.140> my<00:00:43.230> second<00:00:43.649> unit<00:00:43.890> and

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
older version this is my second unit and

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.889 
older version this is my second unit and
I've<00:00:44.129> used<00:00:44.250> other<00:00:44.460> people's<00:00:44.640> units<00:00:45.210> as<00:00:45.420> well

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
I've used other people's units as well

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.660 
I've used other people's units as well
they<00:00:46.230> were<00:00:46.379> great<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.829> actually<00:00:47.039> really<00:00:47.489> love

they were great I actually really love
them<00:00:48.110> this<00:00:49.110> unit<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:49.829> not<00:00:50.309> great<00:00:50.550> at<00:00:50.670> all<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.600> 5

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
them this unit is not great at all the 5

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.590 
them this unit is not great at all the 5
6<00:00:52.530> 0b<00:00:53.160> HDV<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.820> small<00:00:54.059> unit<00:00:54.360> from<00:00:54.449> this

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
6 0b HDV the small unit from this

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.380 
6 0b HDV the small unit from this
there's<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.870> test<00:00:55.170> on<00:00:55.410> my<00:00:55.649> youtube<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.640> thought

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
there's a test on my youtube I thought

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.150 
there's a test on my youtube I thought
that<00:00:57.660> one<00:00:57.840> was<00:00:57.989> just<00:00:58.320> completely<00:00:58.829> terrible

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
that one was just completely terrible

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.660 
that one was just completely terrible
this<00:01:00.000> one<00:01:00.210> however<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.719> just<00:01:01.170> below<00:01:01.559> usable<00:01:02.100> so

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
this one however is just below usable so

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.490 
this one however is just below usable so
some<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.329> parts<00:01:03.600> are<00:01:03.660> still<00:01:03.870> good<00:01:04.049> quality

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
some of the parts are still good quality

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.980 
some of the parts are still good quality
however<00:01:04.710> there's<00:01:05.129> too<00:01:05.309> many<00:01:05.400> issues<00:01:05.869> first<00:01:06.869> of

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
however there's too many issues first of

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.420 
however there's too many issues first of
all<00:01:07.049> they've<00:01:07.170> added<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.500> counterweight<00:01:08.130> system

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
all they've added a counterweight system

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.330 
all they've added a counterweight system
a<00:01:08.760> counterbalance<00:01:09.360> system<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.890> head<00:01:11.130> and

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
a counterbalance system to the head and

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.580 
a counterbalance system to the head and
it's<00:01:11.909> too<00:01:12.119> strong<00:01:12.450> for<00:01:12.810> use<00:01:12.990> with<00:01:13.229> just

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
it's too strong for use with just

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.100 
it's too strong for use with just
something<00:01:13.920> like<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.070> camera<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:15.090> even<00:01:16.080> just

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
something like a camera so even just

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.960 
something like a camera so even just
aiming<00:01:16.619> down<00:01:16.860> there<00:01:17.130> it's<00:01:17.340> too<00:01:17.520> strong<00:01:17.790> it's

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
aiming down there it's too strong it's

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.160 
aiming down there it's too strong it's
pushing<00:01:18.299> back<00:01:18.420> up<00:01:18.570> as<00:01:18.689> soon<00:01:18.780> as<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:18.930> let<00:01:19.049> go

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
pushing back up as soon as you let go

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.929 
pushing back up as soon as you let go
it's<00:01:19.409> pushing<00:01:19.650> back<00:01:19.770> up<00:01:19.979> it's<00:01:20.640> definitely

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
it's pushing back up it's definitely

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.780 
it's pushing back up it's definitely
pushing<00:01:21.659> far<00:01:22.110> too<00:01:22.290> much<00:01:22.470> when<00:01:23.340> you're<00:01:23.549> at<00:01:23.670> that

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
pushing far too much when you're at that

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:24.859 
pushing far too much when you're at that
sort<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.090> way<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.270> know<00:01:24.360> if<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.570> wanted<00:01:24.750> to

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
sort of way you know if you wanted to

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.929 
sort of way you know if you wanted to
aim<00:01:25.049> at<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.350> sky<00:01:25.619> you're<00:01:26.280> sort<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.580> pushing

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
aim at the sky you're sort of pushing

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.469 
aim at the sky you're sort of pushing
against<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:28.610> counterbalance<00:01:29.610> system<00:01:30.180> which

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
against the counterbalance system which

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.050 
against the counterbalance system which
is<00:01:30.659> really<00:01:31.049> not<00:01:31.259> great<00:01:31.530> another<00:01:32.520> issue<00:01:32.729> which

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
is really not great another issue which

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.960 
is really not great another issue which
was<00:01:33.210> on<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.659> previous<00:01:34.110> one<00:01:34.140> as<00:01:34.409> well<00:01:34.880> first<00:01:35.880> of

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
was on the previous one as well first of

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.670 
was on the previous one as well first of
all<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.090> had<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.390> adjust<00:01:36.540> this<00:01:37.170> little<00:01:37.470> knob

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
all I had to adjust this little knob

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:35.770 
very slightly and it's kind of sort of
almost<00:03:33.440> impossible<00:03:34.100> to<00:03:34.280> not<00:03:35.000> move<00:03:35.180> completely

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
almost impossible to not move completely

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:36.849 
almost impossible to not move completely
when<00:03:35.900> you're<00:03:36.019> holding<00:03:36.170> the<00:03:36.319> monopod<00:03:36.650> like

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:36.859 
when you're holding the monopod like

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:39.940 
when you're holding the monopod like
this<00:03:37.040> and<00:03:38.260> eventually<00:03:39.260> you'll<00:03:39.440> move<00:03:39.650> enough

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
this and eventually you'll move enough

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.090 
this and eventually you'll move enough
and<00:03:40.250> it<00:03:40.430> will<00:03:40.549> go<00:03:40.730> cook<00:03:41.180> like<00:03:41.870> that<00:03:41.900> and<00:03:42.440> it's

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
and it will go cook like that and it's

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.740 
and it will go cook like that and it's
especially<00:03:43.340> difficult<00:03:43.790> if<00:03:44.239> you're<00:03:44.359> in<00:03:44.510> some

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
especially difficult if you're in some

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.000 
especially difficult if you're in some
wherewithal<00:03:45.170> of<00:03:45.230> movement<00:03:45.739> you<00:03:45.799> know<00:03:45.950> you

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
wherewithal of movement you know you

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.530 
wherewithal of movement you know you
look<00:03:46.250> away<00:03:46.430> from<00:03:46.489> the<00:03:46.700> camera<00:03:46.970> for<00:03:47.000> a<00:03:47.150> second

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
look away from the camera for a second

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.750 
look away from the camera for a second
and<00:03:47.660> you've<00:03:48.139> definitely<00:03:48.380> lost<00:03:48.709> the<00:03:49.280> shot

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
and you've definitely lost the shot

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.910 
and you've definitely lost the shot
it<00:03:49.819> definitely<00:03:50.120> has<00:03:50.870> sort<00:03:51.290> of<00:03:51.350> I'm<00:03:51.590> not<00:03:51.769> sure

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
it definitely has sort of I'm not sure

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.379 
it definitely has sort of I'm not sure
if<00:03:51.980> it's<00:03:52.130> by<00:03:52.400> the<00:03:52.459> way<00:03:52.609> if<00:03:52.700> the<00:03:52.819> audio<00:03:53.150> is<00:03:53.299> going

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:53.389 
if it's by the way if the audio is going

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:55.150 
if it's by the way if the audio is going
through<00:03:53.989> to<00:03:54.019> the<00:03:54.200> camera<00:03:54.470> but<00:03:54.590> it's<00:03:54.739> creaking

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
through to the camera but it's creaking

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.559 
through to the camera but it's creaking
every<00:03:55.670> time<00:03:55.819> it<00:03:55.940> does<00:03:56.060> that<00:03:56.239> at<00:03:56.329> creaks

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
every time it does that at creaks

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.690 
every time it does that at creaks
especially<00:03:57.560> if<00:03:57.650> I<00:03:57.769> were<00:03:57.859> to<00:03:57.980> try<00:03:58.130> and<00:03:58.310> move<00:03:58.430> and

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
especially if I were to try and move and

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.940 
especially if I were to try and move and
right<00:03:59.690> now<00:03:59.840> it's<00:04:00.019> set<00:04:00.200> to<00:04:00.260> the<00:04:00.470> middle<00:04:00.799> right

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
right now it's set to the middle right

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.640 
right now it's set to the middle right
so<00:04:01.069> it's<00:04:01.190> not<00:04:01.340> -<00:04:01.609> not<00:04:02.540> too<00:04:02.900> tight<00:04:03.230> down<00:04:03.590> there

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
so it's not - not too tight down there

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.220 
so it's not - not too tight down there
the<00:04:03.920> ball<00:04:04.100> joint<00:04:04.310> are<00:04:04.459> not<00:04:04.700> too<00:04:05.120> loose<00:04:05.900> and

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
the ball joint are not too loose and

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.220 
the ball joint are not too loose and
it's<00:04:06.799> still<00:04:07.069> not<00:04:07.190> usable<00:04:07.609> -<00:04:07.880> loose<00:04:08.150> as<00:04:08.630> soon<00:04:09.139> as

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
it's still not usable - loose as soon as

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.789 
it's still not usable - loose as soon as
you<00:04:09.290> try<00:04:09.440> and<00:04:09.530> pan<00:04:09.859> it<00:04:10.299> sort<00:04:11.299> of<00:04:11.359> slips<00:04:11.780> and<00:04:12.079> it

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
you try and pan it sort of slips and it

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:15.400 
you try and pan it sort of slips and it
sucks<00:04:13.100> and<00:04:13.340> then<00:04:13.670> to<00:04:14.510> loose<00:04:14.720> it<00:04:14.930> won't<00:04:15.139> stand

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
sucks and then to loose it won't stand

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.099 
sucks and then to loose it won't stand
up<00:04:15.650> on<00:04:15.859> its<00:04:15.980> own<00:04:16.070> either<00:04:16.539> and<00:04:17.539> right<00:04:17.780> now<00:04:17.900> it

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
up on its own either and right now it

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.219 
up on its own either and right now it
will<00:04:18.289> stand<00:04:18.590> up<00:04:18.769> on<00:04:18.889> its<00:04:19.039> own<00:04:19.479> but<00:04:20.479> then<00:04:21.109> if

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
will stand up on its own but then if

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:22.750 
will stand up on its own but then if
it's<00:04:21.409> too<00:04:21.620> tight<00:04:21.650> then<00:04:22.250> the<00:04:22.370> whole<00:04:22.520> thing

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
it's too tight then the whole thing

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:23.840 
it's too tight then the whole thing
becomes<00:04:22.909> so

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
becomes so

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.690 
becomes so
wobbly<00:04:24.720> in<00:04:24.840> a<00:04:24.930> weird<00:04:25.140> way<00:04:25.230> and<00:04:25.590> it's<00:04:26.160> and<00:04:26.550> it

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
wobbly in a weird way and it's and it

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.400 
wobbly in a weird way and it's and it
completely<00:04:27.240> creaks<00:04:27.690> the<00:04:28.080> entire<00:04:28.320> time<00:04:28.560> so

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
completely creaks the entire time so

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:36.200 
completely creaks the entire time so
definitely<00:04:31.410> not<00:04:32.750> great<00:04:34.520> system<00:04:35.520> anymore<00:04:35.850> at

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
definitely not great system anymore at

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.310 
definitely not great system anymore at
all<00:04:36.300> I<00:04:36.510> don't<00:04:36.570> know<00:04:36.660> if<00:04:36.780> they've<00:04:36.930> changed<00:04:37.170> the

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
all I don't know if they've changed the

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.230 
all I don't know if they've changed the
design<00:04:37.590> at<00:04:37.740> the<00:04:37.830> bottom<00:04:38.220> as<00:04:38.400> well<00:04:38.430> it<00:04:38.910> looks

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
design at the bottom as well it looks

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.170 
design at the bottom as well it looks
the<00:04:39.390> same<00:04:39.660> but<00:04:40.040> it<00:04:41.040> does<00:04:41.160> not<00:04:41.400> well<00:04:41.610> crack<00:04:42.000> well

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
the same but it does not well crack well

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.070 
the same but it does not well crack well
anymore<00:04:42.450> for<00:04:42.930> me<00:04:43.220> so<00:04:44.220> this<00:04:45.180> will<00:04:45.480> be<00:04:45.690> returned

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
anymore for me so this will be returned

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.890 
anymore for me so this will be returned
I'm<00:04:46.260> no<00:04:46.500> longer<00:04:46.920> happy<00:04:47.880> with<00:04:48.090> this<00:04:48.300> unit<00:04:48.690> it

one<00:05:18.720> or<00:05:19.080> maybe<00:05:19.260> even<00:05:19.380> if<00:05:19.980> it's<00:05:20.100> the<00:05:20.220> new<00:05:20.340> one

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
one or maybe even if it's the new one

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.090 
one or maybe even if it's the new one
maybe<00:05:20.850> you<00:05:21.150> will<00:05:21.360> like<00:05:21.390> it<00:05:21.860> again<00:05:22.860> some<00:05:23.070> people

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
maybe you will like it again some people

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.370 
maybe you will like it again some people
like<00:05:23.550> stuff<00:05:23.880> that<00:05:23.910> I<00:05:24.360> don't<00:05:24.660> a<00:05:24.840> lot<00:05:25.080> of<00:05:25.140> people

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
like stuff that I don't a lot of people

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.580 
like stuff that I don't a lot of people
do<00:05:25.620> like<00:05:25.890> the<00:05:26.340> Manfrotto<00:05:26.880> video<00:05:27.210> heads<00:05:27.590> the

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
do like the Manfrotto video heads the

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:29.960 
do like the Manfrotto video heads the
fact<00:05:28.800> that<00:05:28.860> I<00:05:28.980> don't<00:05:29.040> like<00:05:29.250> them<00:05:29.430> is<00:05:29.610> just

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
fact that I don't like them is just

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.690 
fact that I don't like them is just
personal<00:05:30.660> opinion<00:05:31.220> what<00:05:32.220> I<00:05:32.250> will<00:05:32.490> be<00:05:32.580> using

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
personal opinion what I will be using

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.930 
personal opinion what I will be using
instead<00:05:33.210> is<00:05:33.420> this<00:05:33.990> tiny<00:05:34.470> little<00:05:34.800> thing<00:05:35.190> that

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
instead is this tiny little thing that

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.370 
instead is this tiny little thing that
you<00:05:36.150> know<00:05:36.240> some<00:05:36.450> people<00:05:36.540> will<00:05:36.840> look<00:05:37.050> at<00:05:37.170> it<00:05:37.230> and

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
you know some people will look at it and

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.080 
you know some people will look at it and
go<00:05:37.470> what<00:05:37.710> you<00:05:38.040> know<00:05:38.160> that's<00:05:38.310> that's<00:05:38.610> you<00:05:38.940> know

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
go what you know that's that's you know

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.800 
go what you know that's that's you know
a<00:05:39.330> little<00:05:41.090> you<00:05:42.090> know<00:05:42.120> not<00:05:42.480> something<00:05:42.630> you

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
a little you know not something you

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.440 
a little you know not something you
would<00:05:42.930> consider<00:05:42.960> professional<00:05:43.940> but<00:05:44.940> having

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.450 
would consider professional but having

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.630 
would consider professional but having
tried<00:05:45.810> it<00:05:45.990> as<00:05:46.200> both<00:05:46.560> a<00:05:46.680> monopod<00:05:47.010> and<00:05:47.160> a<00:05:47.370> tripod

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:47.640 
tried it as both a monopod and a tripod

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.000 
tried it as both a monopod and a tripod
I<00:05:47.940> absolutely<00:05:48.330> love<00:05:48.630> it<00:05:48.780> it's<00:05:49.350> it's<00:05:49.830> really

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
I absolutely love it it's it's really

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.730 
I absolutely love it it's it's really
tiny<00:05:50.280> its<00:05:50.700> costs<00:05:51.510> way<00:05:51.900> less<00:05:51.930> than<00:05:52.350> this<00:05:52.470> thing

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
tiny its costs way less than this thing

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.240 
tiny its costs way less than this thing
and<00:05:53.270> as<00:05:54.270> a<00:05:54.540> monopod<00:05:55.020> it's<00:05:55.230> actually<00:05:55.560> just<00:05:56.100> as

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
and as a monopod it's actually just as

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.040 
and as a monopod it's actually just as
stable<00:05:56.520> and<00:05:56.850> has<00:05:57.060> less<00:05:57.270> issues<00:05:57.660> and<00:05:57.870> doesn't

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
stable and has less issues and doesn't

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.500 
stable and has less issues and doesn't
creak<00:05:58.410> and<00:05:58.680> as<00:05:59.520> a<00:05:59.550> manova<00:05:59.940> because<00:06:00.210> it's<00:06:00.360> got

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:00.510 
creak and as a manova because it's got

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.680 
creak and as a manova because it's got
three<00:06:00.780> legs<00:06:00.960> then<00:06:01.560> it's<00:06:01.890> eliminating<00:06:02.690> because

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 
three legs then it's eliminating because

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.720 
three legs then it's eliminating because
with<00:06:03.900> most<00:06:04.050> monopods<00:06:04.560> the<00:06:04.860> only<00:06:05.190> real<00:06:05.400> issue

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:05.730 
with most monopods the only real issue

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:09.410 
with most monopods the only real issue
there<00:06:06.060> is<00:06:06.180> is<00:06:06.360> sideways<00:06:06.960> shake<00:06:07.440> and<00:06:08.210> that<00:06:09.210> is

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:09.420 
there is is sideways shake and that is

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.060 
there is is sideways shake and that is
eliminating<00:06:10.170> because<00:06:10.380> it's<00:06:10.530> got<00:06:10.650> three<00:06:10.890> legs

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.070 
eliminating because it's got three legs

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.400 
eliminating because it's got three legs
nice<00:06:11.550> and<00:06:11.700> close<00:06:11.820> together<00:06:12.000> when<00:06:12.930> used<00:06:13.170> as<00:06:13.380> a

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:13.410 
nice and close together when used as a

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.620 
nice and close together when used as a
monopod<00:06:13.800> it's<00:06:14.100> eliminating<00:06:14.880> that<00:06:15.090> shake<00:06:15.390> and

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:15.630 
monopod it's eliminating that shake and

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.430 
monopod it's eliminating that shake and
that's<00:06:15.780> actually<00:06:16.560> quite<00:06:17.010> lovely

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 
that's actually quite lovely

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.440 
that's actually quite lovely
so<00:06:19.440> buff<00:06:19.860> from<00:06:19.950> that<00:06:20.130> using<00:06:20.520> it<00:06:20.700> for<00:06:21.120> sit-down

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:21.450 
so buff from that using it for sit-down

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.720 
so buff from that using it for sit-down
interviews<00:06:21.900> using<00:06:22.470> it<00:06:22.620> for<00:06:22.890> travel<00:06:23.310> using<00:06:23.460> it

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:23.730 
interviews using it for travel using it

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:25.520 
interviews using it for travel using it
for<00:06:23.970> time<00:06:24.210> lapses<00:06:24.630> when<00:06:25.140> I<00:06:25.170> don't<00:06:25.350> want<00:06:25.470> to

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:25.530 
for time lapses when I don't want to

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.770 
for time lapses when I don't want to
carry<00:06:25.710> around<00:06:26.000> something<00:06:27.000> even<00:06:27.360> as<00:06:27.480> big<00:06:27.630> as

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:27.780 
carry around something even as big as

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.640 
carry around something even as big as
this<00:06:27.960> which<00:06:28.230> by<00:06:28.440> the<00:06:28.500> way<00:06:28.590> is<00:06:28.680> a<00:06:28.770> lot<00:06:28.920> heavier

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:30.650 
this which by the way is a lot heavier

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.060 
this which by the way is a lot heavier
then<00:06:31.650> yeah<00:06:32.160> this<00:06:32.550> little<00:06:32.880> tiny<00:06:33.300> little<00:06:33.570> tripod

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.070 
then yeah this little tiny little tripod

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.549 
then yeah this little tiny little tripod
actually<00:06:35.070> does<00:06:35.280> the<00:06:35.520> job

00:06:36.549 --> 00:06:36.559 
actually does the job

00:06:36.559 --> 00:06:38.619 
actually does the job
and<00:06:36.649> I<00:06:37.189> actually<00:06:37.729> really<00:06:38.059> like<00:06:38.239> it<00:06:38.419> and<00:06:38.509> it's

00:06:38.619 --> 00:06:38.629 
and I actually really like it and it's

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:40.299 
and I actually really like it and it's
actually<00:06:38.839> something<00:06:39.049> that<00:06:39.349> I<00:06:39.709> find<00:06:40.189> really

00:06:40.299 --> 00:06:40.309 
actually something that I find really

00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:42.669 
actually something that I find really
nice<00:06:40.669> to<00:06:40.879> work<00:06:41.029> with<00:06:41.259> compared<00:06:42.259> to<00:06:42.379> this<00:06:42.499> and

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:42.679 
nice to work with compared to this and

00:06:42.679 --> 00:06:44.379 
nice to work with compared to this and
of<00:06:42.889> course<00:06:43.099> it's<00:06:43.219> not<00:06:43.279> a<00:06:43.399> fluid<00:06:43.699> head<00:06:43.729> so<00:06:44.329> you

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:44.389 
of course it's not a fluid head so you

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:46.899 
of course it's not a fluid head so you
won't<00:06:44.659> be<00:06:44.779> able<00:06:44.959> to<00:06:45.109> do<00:06:45.859> sort<00:06:46.219> of<00:06:46.279> a<00:06:46.339> sideways

00:06:46.899 --> 00:06:46.909 
won't be able to do sort of a sideways

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:49.089 
won't be able to do sort of a sideways
move<00:06:47.089> but<00:06:47.449> I<00:06:47.629> actually<00:06:47.869> am<00:06:48.289> not<00:06:48.859> that

00:06:49.089 --> 00:06:49.099 
move but I actually am not that

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:51.249 
move but I actually am not that
impressed<00:06:49.489> with<00:06:50.089> the<00:06:50.239> moves<00:06:50.479> I<00:06:50.689> can<00:06:50.899> get<00:06:51.079> with

00:06:51.249 --> 00:06:51.259 
impressed with the moves I can get with

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:55.269 
impressed with the moves I can get with
this<00:06:51.849> the<00:06:52.849> fact<00:06:53.209> that<00:06:53.539> you<00:06:53.629> have<00:06:53.899> one<00:06:54.379> joint<00:06:54.739> at

00:06:55.269 --> 00:06:55.279 
this the fact that you have one joint at

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:58.629 
this the fact that you have one joint at
the<00:06:55.339> bottom<00:06:55.969> and<00:06:56.239> then<00:06:56.779> one<00:06:57.499> joint<00:06:57.859> at<00:06:58.129> the<00:06:58.219> top

00:06:58.629 --> 00:06:58.639 
the bottom and then one joint at the top

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:02.199 
the bottom and then one joint at the top
being<00:06:59.089> pan<00:06:59.679> at<00:07:00.679> the<00:07:00.829> bottom<00:07:01.189> and<00:07:01.429> then<00:07:01.699> tilt<00:07:01.999> at

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:02.209 
being pan at the bottom and then tilt at

00:07:02.209 --> 00:07:04.449 
being pan at the bottom and then tilt at
the<00:07:02.389> top<00:07:02.629> you<00:07:03.589> have<00:07:03.739> to<00:07:03.859> sort<00:07:04.039> of<00:07:04.099> move<00:07:04.249> the

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:04.459 
the top you have to sort of move the

00:07:04.459 --> 00:07:08.229 
the top you have to sort of move the
entire<00:07:04.999> system<00:07:06.099> to<00:07:07.099> sort<00:07:07.279> of<00:07:07.339> do<00:07:07.519> a<00:07:07.549> pan<00:07:07.819> tilt

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:08.239 
entire system to sort of do a pan tilt

00:07:08.239 --> 00:07:09.609 
entire system to sort of do a pan tilt
to<00:07:08.419> follow<00:07:08.659> let's<00:07:08.929> say<00:07:09.049> if<00:07:09.109> you<00:07:09.199> want<00:07:09.379> to<00:07:09.439> go

00:07:09.609 --> 00:07:09.619 
to follow let's say if you want to go

00:07:09.619 --> 00:07:13.149 
to follow let's say if you want to go
like<00:07:10.219> that<00:07:10.489> and<00:07:10.699> do<00:07:10.849> move<00:07:11.119> like<00:07:11.779> that<00:07:11.919> it<00:07:12.919> just

00:07:13.149 --> 00:07:13.159 
like that and do move like that it just

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:14.709 
like that and do move like that it just
feels<00:07:13.489> weird<00:07:13.609> and<00:07:14.029> it<00:07:14.179> doesn't<00:07:14.599> feel<00:07:14.659> natural

00:07:14.709 --> 00:07:14.719 
feels weird and it doesn't feel natural

00:07:14.719 --> 00:07:18.189 
feels weird and it doesn't feel natural
in<00:07:15.169> it<00:07:15.229> and<00:07:15.379> the<00:07:15.499> move<00:07:15.709> isn't<00:07:15.979> as<00:07:16.959> fluid<00:07:17.959> and

00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:18.199 
in it and the move isn't as fluid and

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:20.949 
in it and the move isn't as fluid and
isn't<00:07:18.559> as<00:07:18.709> stable<00:07:19.219> and<00:07:19.819> I<00:07:20.179> don't<00:07:20.239> like<00:07:20.929> it

00:07:20.949 --> 00:07:20.959 
isn't as stable and I don't like it

00:07:20.959 --> 00:07:23.829 
isn't as stable and I don't like it
anymore<00:07:21.649> so<00:07:22.129> I<00:07:22.159> hope<00:07:22.819> my<00:07:22.969> opinion<00:07:23.389> about<00:07:23.569> this

00:07:23.829 --> 00:07:23.839 
anymore so I hope my opinion about this

00:07:23.839 --> 00:07:27.099 
anymore so I hope my opinion about this
has<00:07:24.139> been<00:07:24.319> useful<00:07:24.769> to<00:07:24.799> you<00:07:25.599> again<00:07:26.599> this<00:07:26.899> is
