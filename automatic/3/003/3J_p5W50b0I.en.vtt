00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.090
 so I take the brick is so a 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:13.139
 360 degree rotation thereby 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.210
 end a point to which is 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.760
 the vein that should flow under our 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:25.320
 feet here so she is 25 feet from 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:29.130
 my place 3 4 5 6 7 and take it back on 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.580
 vigilant momentum advance until wait 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.580
 movement 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.290
 one validates the movement of the rod 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.320
 bank 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.300
 the first arrives as a river in 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.520
 to the right bank and the left bank we 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.190
 determines the right bank of the source and 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.200
 the left is the two which releases so 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.750
 of energy since there is a friction 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.809
 on the right bank and left bank 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.250
 after the water will be so in the middle 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.809
 so here we will determine the meaning of 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.449
 current 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:02.430
 it validates if she too has 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.470
 not in France but horizontally and in 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.570
 simply advance until the 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.760
 wand moves there goes down so that 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.500
 the in my back a polarity merchant 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.229
 it's like an electric current more - 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.670
 there is a sense of flow in a 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.130
 time we had the sense that in the back 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:21.750
 So we turn around and face each other 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.290
 alas the show so the go up against 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.189
 man so come from there up and she's going 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.189
 down so 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.930
 so the chopsticks years she can 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.220
 determine the direction of flow following the 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.420
 controls with the chopsticks we're going to 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.550
 do with the chopstick test so 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.320
 that they are this plastic wrists 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.140
 or in Bakelite and who turns on it 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.850
 even what they will tell us the 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.820
 sense of the current if they cross each other on 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.180
 in the lot c-on on the face sow 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.290
 that's what makes it possible to control 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.400
 compared to the baguette to see if 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.260
 it's going to give me exactly the same thing 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.510
 if it gives the same thing it's good 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.370
 sign it does not give the same the same thing 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.790
 it's not good that there is 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.740
 a problem 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.290
 so we stand between the two banks 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.710
 mounts the two chopsticks not quite 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.540
 horizontally and we advance alas they 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.760
 have to cross which is a good 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.730
 sign kicks it on 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.470
 connects one disconnects each stroke of 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.209
 hilal foot will do it more and more 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:23.490
 quickly now I'm connected the 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.250
 fish that makes the continent fish and 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:29.310
 well he is facing the current and he 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.970
 wait for the food generally so 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:36.180
 we take the fish like those in 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.430
 balance and there we will move between 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.470
 both banks 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.510
 here I show you and do so we get 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.030
 moves and he will turn directly 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:49.620
 towards the direction of the current 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:51.030
 it also goes in the direction of the current on 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.440
 advance we advance we advance 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.630
 and there we tighten our wrists and we 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.140
 do not try to flop alas the bucket of 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.300
 to defend oneself 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.650
 it's a huge force the field 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.930
 Magnetic is pretty sturdy 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:07.040
 good it must be done do 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.040
 it's not overnight 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.900
 here we go between the two banks we put a 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.700
 arm in the air and we will let 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.620
 the pendulum logically and turn 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.480
 seven times stop hoping to launch this 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:24.420
 times 5 6 7 and he wants to stop 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.780
 that's what proves to me that he's on 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.780
 a vein of water
