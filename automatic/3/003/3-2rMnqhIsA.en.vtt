00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.800
 today I want to talk about radiola and if 

00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:05.750
 had to put a title would be radio 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.100
 now it's going away from the budget is a 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.860
 very curious book the form has about 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.139
 150 chapters that can be read in two 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.169
 forms or see it in the normal order 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.240
 from 1 to 56 more or less forget about the 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:19.519
 others or read the seconds of 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.170
 apparently random that is exposed to 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.609
 beginning of the book I chose to read it from 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.320
 the longest way to end here all 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.240
 the chapters because I assumed that that 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.949
 would give a more complete vision and in 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.689
 effect the extended version is not only 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.369
 tells you the central story but 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.140
 also the intention of the author at the time 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.820
 to write the novel if you read the version 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.920
 long I think it's very clear from the 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.710
 first page that what this is about 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.030
 book is about how to live life as it is 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.160
 from the routine of the banal 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.899
 in fact the lines from where I inferred this 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.660
 they seemed like a genius to me and I want 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.760
 read it, but who will cure us 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.590
 fire deaf of fire without color that 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.530
 runs at nightfall by the light of the uset 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.230
 coming out through the worm-eaten portals of 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.480
 the taguanes barbels of the fire without image 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.519
 that licks stones and lurks vain 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.170
 of the doors as we will do for 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:04.339
 wash us from your sweet burn that 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.469
 continue 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.840
 to last allied time and 

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:10.789
 I remember the sticky substances that 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.270
 they keep us on this side and that we 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:15.789
 will burn sweetly this calcined 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.219
 then it is better to agree like cats 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:20.740
 and the mosses work immediate friendship 

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:22.570
 with the porters of hoarse voices with the 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.490
 pale and suffering creatures that 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.409
 they lurk in the windows playing with a 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.899
 pot I think the game symbolizes 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.729
 the time the life that happens and consumes us 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:32.709
 little by little but inevitably 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.090
 pale creatures playing in the window 

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:36.340
 with a dry branch it seems like a 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.860
 genius they observe the people who 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.450
 It goes down the street to the people who live and 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.700
 meanwhile playing on a dry branch 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.489
 a branch that had life but no longer the 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.840
 it has a memory the distance but 

00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:48.340
 this I have taxes and what very 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.380
 honestly also in the first 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.270
 leaves a little later is questioned 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.789
 if this issue if the mere fact of 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.619
 questioning how to enjoy life is 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:58.780
 legitimate, maybe by questioning that 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.270
 same as enjoying life we 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.679
 We turn away from it going to literature 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.259
 the writing or any other height 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:06.579
 as it says cut and that way it's not 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.200
 impossible to enjoy life 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:09.789
 fully in the first part of the book 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.799
 I think this is appreciated very well because 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.319
 prayer spend a lot of time with the beloved 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:15.549
 whom she admires because she lives 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.920
 she does not understand conversations 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:19.599
 between now and his intellectual friends 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.239
 because he is dedicated to living his life instead 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:23.620
 to think how they all do each 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.870
 one in his field so he wants to live 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.849
 he wants to experiment and that's why he wanders 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.069
 but when he sees something he fails to react 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:31.989
 to be part of the situation and live 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.180
 like me that I am with another old plan 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.829
 who does not do anything only observes then a 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.750
 concert is a terrible failure and 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:40.060
 feels sorry for the concert 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.409
 the fund is like the achievement company without 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.510
 know a medium because with certain 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:45.159
 shame be an older woman and finished 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.169
 this time try to be part of the 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:48.790
 situation but fails also tries 

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:50.859
 help the woman but she rejected her 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.329
 help stating that he does not need it he 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:53.680
 feel identified with this lady that 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:56.049
 is what makes him take part in the 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.310
 problems of it but nevertheless not 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.049
 does a lot to fix his own 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.299
 juncture finally and how does the 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.889
 part of countries wanting to experiment and 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.109
 for it uses as solid 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:07.540
 spend time with a beggar at dawn 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:09.489
 as a place to discuss with your friends the 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.049
 intellectuals however he continues without 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.480
 face the real problems and 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.620
 terrible that happen around him and that 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.730
 would involve living 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.170
 later many things happen 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.910
 I do not want to go much deeper into the 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.140
 story because, as I said, they have 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.910
 taken of course as to the 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.530
 protagonist as I was reading my image 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.820
 of him and he's becoming increasingly poor 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.430
 who at first seems to me a man 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.070
 interesting cult happens to be a selfish 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.870
 then for the loss and then someone 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.460
 what is happening to someone who does not achieve 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.600
 reason and act with a minimum of 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.270
 sanity I think this book is 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.160
 very powerful and I stay with 20% all 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.470
 what is it, I miss many things 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.000
 levels both the thousands of references to 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.830
 pieces of art that cut is included 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.420
 as the same literature of the book there is 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.370
 many literary figures and one 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.740
 corner of anger is that now I get 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.420
 locate people and understand them 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.730
 to analyze them on the fly in the 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.400
 case of raiola is mate and tobacco 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.500
 Canadian also the most obvious radio 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.970
 among other things I read the version 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.280
 long because I wanted to read the most 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.740
 complete possible but I think it can 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.510
 be quite dense for readers 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.890
 amateur like me since not only do you 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.570
 tells the story but also it 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.480
 they add many reflections of the character 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:19.109
 principal and also talking about putting it 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:22.000
 in the mouth of a fictional writer 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:24.370
 the book talks about living and how to live 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.900
 what decisions to take leave of mind 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.210
 since it's a great book and you can 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.340
 help maybe is not accompanied perhaps 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.050
 it just upsets you and makes you think 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.400
 what are you doing to build this is a 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.080
 little terrible but it can also be 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.060
 great utility commented that here you 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.780
 made me think and hopscotch made me 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.069
 think who wants to do community and 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.050
 quite besides and comment that 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:46.469
 I find some answer until the 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.469
 next
