00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
at so when when do you typically inspect

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.640 
at so when when do you typically inspect
brakes<00:00:17.430> every<00:00:18.240> time<00:00:18.420> we<00:00:18.539> do<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.720> tire<00:00:18.990> rotation

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
brakes every time we do a tire rotation

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.420 
brakes every time we do a tire rotation
okay

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
okay

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.859 
okay
so<00:00:20.550> every<00:00:20.699> time<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.910> Tigers<00:00:21.180> come<00:00:21.270> off<00:00:21.420> you

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
so every time the Tigers come off you

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.179 
so every time the Tigers come off you
take<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.080> look<00:00:22.199> at<00:00:22.320> all<00:00:22.410> four<00:00:22.650> sets<00:00:22.890> of<00:00:22.980> brakes

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
take a look at all four sets of brakes

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.420 
take a look at all four sets of brakes
or<00:00:23.490> all<00:00:23.609> four<00:00:24.300> stations<00:00:24.510> yeah<00:00:25.080> okay<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:25.980> then

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
or all four stations yeah okay and then

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.460 
or all four stations yeah okay and then
how<00:00:26.550> do<00:00:26.609> you<00:00:26.699> determine<00:00:27.060> if<00:00:27.689> brake<00:00:28.080> pads<00:00:28.349> are

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
how do you determine if brake pads are

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.349 
how do you determine if brake pads are
good<00:00:28.710> or<00:00:28.949> if<00:00:29.070> they're<00:00:29.310> with<00:00:29.730> their<00:00:29.910> bad<00:00:30.060> well

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
good or if they're with their bad well

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.959 
good or if they're with their bad well
we<00:00:30.840> use<00:00:31.349> this<00:00:31.619> gauge<00:00:32.540> which<00:00:33.540> shows<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.969> good

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
we use this gauge which shows a good

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.660 
we use this gauge which shows a good
brake<00:00:36.210> pad<00:00:36.680> brake<00:00:37.680> pads<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.129> are<00:00:38.309> starting

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
brake pad brake pads that are starting

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.990 
brake pad brake pads that are starting
to<00:00:38.820> get<00:00:38.940> worn<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.620> red<00:00:40.620> definitely<00:00:41.280> should<00:00:41.910> be

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
to get worn and red definitely should be

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.180 
to get worn and red definitely should be
replaced<00:00:42.329> after<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.320> have<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.649> tire<00:00:43.860> off<00:00:44.160> I

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
replaced after I have the tire off I

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.389 
replaced after I have the tire off I
look<00:00:47.190> in<00:00:47.370> here<00:00:47.640> with<00:00:48.030> my<00:00:48.180> flashlight<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.399> find

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
look in here with my flashlight and find

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.010 
look in here with my flashlight and find
the<00:00:50.550> gauge<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:50.789> matches<00:00:51.420> up<00:00:51.570> with<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.840> brake

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
the gauge that matches up with the brake

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.850 
the gauge that matches up with the brake
pad<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.879> I<00:00:53.879> check<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:54.930> know<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.050> top<00:00:55.379> bottom

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
pad and I check it you know a top bottom

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.240 
pad and I check it you know a top bottom
and<00:00:55.949> middle<00:00:56.510> ok<00:00:57.510> sure<00:00:57.719> there's<00:00:57.960> no<00:00:58.250> abnormal

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
and middle ok sure there's no abnormal

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.040 
and middle ok sure there's no abnormal
wear<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.820> there<00:01:00.090> anything<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.809> would<00:01:00.930> let

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
wear is there anything that would let

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.299 
wear is there anything that would let
somebody<00:01:01.260> know<00:01:01.379> they<00:01:01.620> should<00:01:01.829> be<00:01:01.920> coming<00:01:02.190> in

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
somebody know they should be coming in

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.280 
somebody know they should be coming in
soon<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:03.210> have<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.480> brakes<00:01:03.690> looked<00:01:03.930> at<00:01:04.080> is

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
means that the brake rotors themselves

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.620 
means that the brake rotors themselves
are<00:01:35.100> work<00:01:35.750> and<00:01:37.520> sometimes<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:39.090> can<00:01:39.479> also

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
here all right mining what we look for

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.740 
here all right mining what we look for
on<00:02:09.980> the<00:02:10.130> rear<00:02:10.340> is<00:02:10.700> we<00:02:11.030> inspect<00:02:11.450> the<00:02:11.600> wheel

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
on the rear is we inspect the wheel

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.280 
on the rear is we inspect the wheel
cylinder<00:02:12.940> and<00:02:13.940> all<00:02:14.240> the<00:02:14.360> springs<00:02:14.750> make<00:02:15.110> sure

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
cylinder and all the springs make sure

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.230 
cylinder and all the springs make sure
nothing's<00:02:15.680> broken<00:02:15.770> make<00:02:16.760> sure<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.090> wheel

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
nothing's broken make sure the wheel

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.510 
nothing's broken make sure the wheel
cylinder<00:02:17.540> is<00:02:18.080> not<00:02:18.350> leaking<00:02:18.590> brake<00:02:19.010> fluid<00:02:19.400> and

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
cylinder is not leaking brake fluid and

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.200 
cylinder is not leaking brake fluid and
then<00:02:20.360> we<00:02:20.480> use<00:02:20.660> our<00:02:20.900> gauge<00:02:21.220> to<00:02:22.220> inspect<00:02:23.030> the

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
then we use our gauge to inspect the

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.960 
then we use our gauge to inspect the
rear<00:02:23.450> and<00:02:23.750> these<00:02:24.710> are<00:02:24.920> at<00:02:25.040> four<00:02:25.370> millimeters

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
rear and these are at four millimeters

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.630 
rear and these are at four millimeters
now<00:02:26.630> with<00:02:26.810> rear<00:02:27.080> brake<00:02:27.320> shoes<00:02:27.680> they<00:02:28.370> don't

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
now with rear brake shoes they don't

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.120 
now with rear brake shoes they don't
they're<00:02:29.150> not<00:02:29.180> as<00:02:29.570> thick<00:02:29.870> as<00:02:30.140> a<00:02:30.590> front<00:02:30.980> brake

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
they're not as thick as a front brake

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.690 
they're not as thick as a front brake
pad<00:02:31.540> brand-new<00:02:32.540> out-of-the-box<00:02:33.460> but<00:02:34.460> rear

brakes<00:02:35.000> don't<00:02:35.330> do<00:02:35.570> as<00:02:35.810> much<00:02:35.870> braking<00:02:36.710> as<00:02:36.860> the

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
brakes don't do as much braking as the

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.980 
brakes don't do as much braking as the
front<00:02:37.490> so<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.150> front<00:02:38.390> brakes<00:02:38.630> would<00:02:38.810> usually

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
front so the front brakes would usually

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.920 
front so the front brakes would usually
get<00:02:39.290> replaced<00:02:40.090> sooner<00:02:41.090> or<00:02:41.270> more<00:02:41.480> often<00:02:41.780> than

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
get replaced sooner or more often than

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.600 
get replaced sooner or more often than
they<00:02:42.020> usually<00:02:42.170> figure<00:02:42.890> one<00:02:43.100> on<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.430> back

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
they usually figure one on the back

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:44.140 
they usually figure one on the back
