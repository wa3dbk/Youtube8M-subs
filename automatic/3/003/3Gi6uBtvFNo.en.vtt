results<00:04:48.529> the<00:04:48.830> first<00:04:49.069> like<00:04:49.610> week<00:04:50.169> but<00:04:51.169> or<00:04:51.740> I

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
results the first like week but or I

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.939

you<00:04:55.039> use<00:04:55.099> it<00:04:55.430> about<00:04:55.969> three<00:04:56.960> times<00:04:56.990> you're

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620
