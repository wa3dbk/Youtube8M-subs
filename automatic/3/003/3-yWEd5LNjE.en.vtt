00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
there was I kind of I guess a spinoff

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:38.960 
there was I kind of I guess a spinoff
DVD<00:01:37.439> released<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:38.430> one<00:01:38.640> was<00:01:38.759> just<00:01:38.820> the

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
DVD released and this one was just the

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.649 
DVD released and this one was just the
the<00:01:39.140> the<00:01:40.140> pilots<00:01:41.040> episode<00:01:41.549> or<00:01:42.030> episodes<00:01:42.509> I

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
the the pilots episode or episodes I

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.200 
the the pilots episode or episodes I
should<00:01:42.810> say<00:01:42.990> made<00:01:43.710> into<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.070> kind<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:44.939> feature

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
should say made into a kind of feature

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.789 
should say made into a kind of feature
with<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:45.659> believe<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.020> little<00:01:46.290> bit<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.590> extra

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
with I believe a little bit of extra

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.940 
with I believe a little bit of extra
footage<00:01:47.009> added<00:01:47.640> back<00:01:47.850> into<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:49.229> it's

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
footage added back into it so it's

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.090 
footage added back into it so it's
called<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.340> house<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.670> cath<00:01:50.909> on<00:01:51.649> so<00:01:52.649> it's<00:01:52.950> not

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
called the house of cath on so it's not

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.190 
called the house of cath on so it's not
that<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.790> won't<00:01:53.939> have<00:01:54.119> seen<00:01:54.390> really<00:01:54.630> aside

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
that you won't have seen really aside

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.630 
that you won't have seen really aside
from<00:01:55.350> maybe<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.590> few<00:01:55.799> scenes<00:01:56.100> in<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.310> standard

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
from maybe a few scenes in the standard

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.550 
from maybe a few scenes in the standard
series<00:01:59.780> any<00:02:00.780> different<00:02:01.079> issue<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.380> there's

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
series any different issue that there's

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.310 
series any different issue that there's
a<00:02:01.619> cut<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.490> an<00:02:02.579> uncut<00:02:03.060> version<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.570> believe<00:02:03.600> so

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
a cut of an uncut version I believe so

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.340 
a cut of an uncut version I believe so
this<00:02:05.310> one<00:02:05.520> being<00:02:05.640> off<00:02:05.759> in<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.119> uncut<00:02:06.479> one<00:02:06.689> so

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
this one being off in the uncut one so

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.020 
this one being off in the uncut one so
that's<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.310> difference<00:02:08.670> now<00:02:10.430> what<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.520> can<00:02:11.730> get

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
that's a difference now what you can get

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.790
