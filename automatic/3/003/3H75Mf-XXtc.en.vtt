00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.980
 It is Velika 

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:09.790
 I wonder 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:16.680
 It is also serving as an offer for Fukuchi. 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:23.470
 In addition, we have raised more than 600 minutes of video 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:26.740
 As you see it like this , I think that you are looking at this kind of feeling he's feeling like pc 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.780
 It is not just this kind of video I have sent a variety of 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.400
 Hmm 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.279
 My 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.370
 In the video 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.860
 Let's decide the top 10 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.000
 I think I'm a runner 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.090
 Because 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.380
 High 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:50.650
 That this video was good That video was good 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:54.730
 It No was by all means does not matter at all until a new one from the great old days 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:57.150
 The person in charge is the comment section of this video 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.680
 I want you to write 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.100
 Calculate it 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.750
 Made later 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.370
 Top 10 Ranking 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.980
 I want to put out a video 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.430
 There is a pod 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.430
 Hey this 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.450
 Why do I top 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.450
 Well this 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:25.570
 My videos of Tteyuu person who began to see I recently is you'llcome a lot 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:34.990
 I don't follow the fish I guess it is 600 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:40.150
 If I'm a viewer from the 6 cap model 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:43.409
 I do not feel that say quite a click document was the old videos 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:49.040
 I So I do not know whether to take any video 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:54.070
 Though I am a little in the black history - like moving from the old days is full out 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:58.390
 And I think we made the opportunity to get to know also the video of the so kind of mustard Namukashi 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:01.860
 Play-by-play that guy in that said Oh was doing this kind of play-by-play 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.430
 And if Tsunagare also marked with 9 Introduction 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.050
 think 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:10.810
 7 Good 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:12.220
 People who have been watching since long ago should be good, and those who have started recently may have had such a way 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.120
 By 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:19.629
 I want you to write, so I'll take care when writing 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.629
 For example 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:29.020
 It is like a becozal to select bamboo 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:34.590
 I want kana and write accurately 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.590
 There are as many as 600 tar titles. 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:42.519
 Easy to determine and get to back to as accurately as possible 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.150
 If you have a pc copy the cat 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.500
 Just paste it 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:55.780
 I I'd say is a comment column 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:03:00.180
 It is this and submit here Te ban 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.180
 The title alone is OK Comments Yes 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:07.159
 But if you have a smartphone 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.319
 I guess this piano face will be difficult 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:10.440
 Depending on the model, depending on the model 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.810
 Oh dear 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.470
 So that way as much as possible 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.330
 It stores rely on 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.830
 Or have you understand 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.819
 Because this is said 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:26.210
 As much as possible 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.760
 I think if you can write in detail 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:33.370
 Oh dear 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:35.180
 I I'd come into the obsession Monet to comment say I'm embarrassed 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.380
 For example 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:43.270
 It is vertical 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:43.270
 It says to be this way in the selection will go in there if you have is written in the comments 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.530
 Nde there is evaluation button like 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.210
 If you can do the glacier boti 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.710
 that 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:56.569
 I because the comments will be plus 1 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:04:01.380
 It is why there is a like a good button 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:05.540
 Maybe I can't see the smartphone again tomorrow, so maybe 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.540
 I think only pc will be 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:15.940
 Well processed 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:17.080
 If you want to leave the movie for a while again, there are typical things here 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.540
 I'm holding up 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:22.620
