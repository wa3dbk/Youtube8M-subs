00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
this is the lower frame that is almost

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.150 
this is the lower frame that is almost
completely<00:00:08.880> done<00:00:09.120> now<00:00:09.650> this<00:00:10.650> side<00:00:10.920> is<00:00:10.950> a

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
completely done now this side is a

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.950 
completely done now this side is a
little<00:00:11.400> bit<00:00:11.490> blank<00:00:11.759> I<00:00:12.120> still<00:00:12.509> have<00:00:12.630> to<00:00:12.750> drill

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.939 
little bit blank I still have to drill
some<00:00:13.139> holes<00:00:13.549> but<00:00:14.549> you<00:00:14.700> can<00:00:14.849> see<00:00:15.059> on<00:00:15.150> here<00:00:15.570> I've

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:15.949 
some holes but you can see on here I've

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.140 
some holes but you can see on here I've
got<00:00:16.949> them<00:00:17.130> pretty<00:00:17.340> much<00:00:17.490> all<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.820> way<00:00:17.940> done

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
got them pretty much all the way done

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.300 
got them pretty much all the way done
those<00:00:18.720> are<00:00:19.199> over<00:00:19.470> this<00:00:19.590> should<00:00:19.800> be<00:00:19.980> so<00:00:20.189> I'm

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
those are over this should be so I'm

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.640 
those are over this should be so I'm
pretty<00:00:20.550> happy<00:00:20.699> that<00:00:21.539> is<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.720> nail<00:00:22.080> actually

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
pretty happy that is a nail actually

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.790 
pretty happy that is a nail actually
holding<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.189> hammer<00:00:23.369> in<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:24.560> I'm<00:00:25.560> gonna

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
holding the hammer in and I'm gonna

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.410 
holding the hammer in and I'm gonna
probably<00:00:26.250> countersink<00:00:26.849> that<00:00:27.000> so<00:00:27.180> it's<00:00:27.300> not

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
probably countersink that so it's not

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.310 
probably countersink that so it's not
sticking<00:00:27.689> out<00:00:28.019> anymore<00:00:28.670> but<00:00:29.670> other<00:00:29.939> than<00:00:30.090> that

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
sticking out anymore but other than that

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.959 
sticking out anymore but other than that
everything's<00:00:31.320> pretty<00:00:31.890> flushed<00:00:32.340> down<00:00:32.730> here's

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
everything's pretty flushed down here's

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.600 
everything's pretty flushed down here's
the<00:00:33.059> mainspring<00:00:33.420> housing<00:00:33.800> and<00:00:34.800> that's<00:00:35.040> just<00:00:35.399> a

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
the mainspring housing and that's just a

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.270 
the mainspring housing and that's just a
really<00:00:36.030> really<00:00:36.149> large<00:00:36.620> binder<00:00:37.620> clip<00:00:38.040> that<00:00:38.250> I

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
really really large binder clip that I

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.510 
really really large binder clip that I
just<00:00:38.520> cut<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.059> it's<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.739> right<00:00:40.890> width<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.309> fit

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
just cut and it's the right width to fit

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.580 
just cut and it's the right width to fit
in<00:00:41.640> there<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.780> mainspring<00:00:43.079> housing<00:00:43.140> feels

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
in there the mainspring housing feels

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.139 
in there the mainspring housing feels
really<00:00:43.800> smooth<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.430> was<00:00:44.550> basically<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.969> big

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
really smooth it was basically a big

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.119 
really smooth it was basically a big
block<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.570> paper<00:00:45.750> like<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.440> big<00:00:46.710> square<00:00:46.920> block

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
block of paper like a big square block

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.069 
block of paper like a big square block
of<00:00:47.309> paper<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:47.579> just<00:00:47.879> kept<00:00:48.090> standing<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.660> swollen

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
of paper I just kept standing it swollen

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.740 
of paper I just kept standing it swollen
right<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:50.010> hammer<00:00:50.300> functions<00:00:51.300> like<00:00:51.570> it

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
right the hammer functions like it

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.740 
right the hammer functions like it
should<00:00:55.489> it's<00:00:56.489> pretty<00:00:56.910> strong<00:00:57.239> spring<00:00:57.539> in

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
should it's pretty strong spring in

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.319 
should it's pretty strong spring in
there<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.710> creaking<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.280> actually<00:00:59.699> I'm

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
there and the creaking is actually I'm

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.180 
there and the creaking is actually I'm
not<00:01:00.449> sure<00:01:00.539> what<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.840> creaking<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:02.039> know<00:01:02.129> I

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
not sure what the creaking is you know I

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.410 
not sure what the creaking is you know I
think<00:01:02.219> it's<00:01:02.520> rubbing<00:01:03.860> the<00:01:04.860> arm<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:06.150> connects

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
think it's rubbing the arm that connects

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.050 
think it's rubbing the arm that connects
the<00:01:06.570> hammer<00:01:07.340> to<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.369> mainspring<00:01:09.030> housing

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
the hammer to the mainspring housing

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.810 
the hammer to the mainspring housing
this<00:01:09.450> arm<00:01:09.720> right<00:01:09.900> there<00:01:10.280> you<00:01:11.280> can<00:01:11.430> kind<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.640> see

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
this arm right there you can kind of see

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.140 
this arm right there you can kind of see
how<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:13.040> how<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.070> moves<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.549> think<00:01:14.729> it's<00:01:14.820> rubbing

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
how it how it moves I think it's rubbing

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.670 
how it how it moves I think it's rubbing
something<00:01:15.420> that's<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:15.869> creaking<00:01:16.380> I'm

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
something that's that creaking I'm

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.899 
something that's that creaking I'm
getting<00:01:17.040> but<00:01:18.080> you<00:01:19.080> know<00:01:19.170> what<00:01:19.259> are<00:01:19.350> gonna<00:01:19.439> do<00:01:19.680> I

getting but you know what are gonna do I

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.850 
getting but you know what are gonna do I

out<00:01:22.979> jb<00:01:23.280> weld<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.479> way<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.600> did<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:24.960> was<00:01:25.140> I

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
out jb weld and the way I did that was I

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.780 
out jb weld and the way I did that was I
literally<00:01:25.500> just<00:01:25.799> mixed<00:01:26.100> up<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.250> batch<00:01:26.400> of<00:01:26.430> Jamie

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
literally just mixed up a batch of Jamie

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.300 
literally just mixed up a batch of Jamie
wild<00:01:27.150> poured<00:01:27.900> in<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.200> little<00:01:28.409> cup<00:01:28.619> let<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.040> sit

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
wild poured in a little cup let it sit

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.880 
wild poured in a little cup let it sit
until<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.759> had<00:01:29.939> like<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.229> hard<00:01:31.229> gray<00:01:31.560> black<00:01:31.860> and

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
until I had like a hard gray black and

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.280 
until I had like a hard gray black and
sanded<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.700> down<00:01:32.880> into<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.299> shape<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.900> this<00:01:34.020> here

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
sanded it down into a shape of this here

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.140 
sanded it down into a shape of this here
and<00:01:34.890> I'm<00:01:34.979> trying<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.220> put<00:01:35.369> together<00:01:35.490> now<00:01:35.820> let

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
and I'm trying to put together now let

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.590 
and I'm trying to put together now let
me<00:01:36.210> see<00:01:36.360> if<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.509> got<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:37.070> and<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.520> did<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:38.939> got<00:01:39.509> to

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
me see if I got it and I did it I got to

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.050 
me see if I got it and I did it I got to
put<00:01:39.750> together<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.890> put<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.520> in<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.670> gun<00:01:41.820> and

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
put together and I put it in a gun and

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.310 
put together and I put it in a gun and
it<00:01:42.119> was<00:01:42.210> working<00:01:42.509> real<00:01:42.659> great<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.110> then<00:01:43.290> I

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
it was working real great and then I

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.219 
it was working real great and then I
gave<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.680> gun<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.799> my<00:01:43.920> wife<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.460> she<00:01:45.420> cranked

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
gave the gun to my wife and she cranked

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.289 
gave the gun to my wife and she cranked
that<00:01:46.350> hammer<00:01:46.530> back<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:47.070> stamp<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.820> things<00:01:48.030> so

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
that hammer back and stamp the things so

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.910 
that hammer back and stamp the things so
I<00:01:48.329> guess<00:01:48.630> jb<00:01:48.899> weld<00:01:48.990> wasn't<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.409> best<00:01:49.619> thing

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
I guess jb weld wasn't the best thing
