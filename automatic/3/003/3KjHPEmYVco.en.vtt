clogged<00:00:07.589> ear<00:00:07.830> we<00:00:07.950> got<00:00:08.069> to<00:00:08.189> think<00:00:08.340> about<00:00:08.429> what

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
clogged ear we got to think about what

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.540 
clogged ear we got to think about what
part<00:00:09.120> of<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.389> ear<00:00:09.540> is<00:00:09.719> clogged<00:00:10.019> and<00:00:10.490> how<00:00:11.490> we

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
part of the ear is clogged and how we

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.810 
part of the ear is clogged and how we
might<00:00:11.910> fix<00:00:12.269> it<00:00:12.480> looking<00:00:13.019> at<00:00:13.110> this<00:00:13.230> ear<00:00:13.530> model

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:13.820 
might fix it looking at this ear model

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.919 
might fix it looking at this ear model
clogs<00:00:14.820> can<00:00:15.059> occur<00:00:15.269> in<00:00:15.360> a<00:00:15.420> couple<00:00:15.690> of<00:00:15.750> places

clogs can occur in a couple of places

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.680 
clogs can occur in a couple of places
this<00:00:16.650> is<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.859> external<00:00:17.460> auditory<00:00:17.910> canal<00:00:18.029> and

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
this is the external auditory canal and

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.380 
this is the external auditory canal and
it<00:00:19.350> ends<00:00:19.859> in<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.160> eardrum<00:00:20.340> this<00:00:20.760> is<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:20.910> sealed

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
it ends in the eardrum this is a sealed

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.200 
it ends in the eardrum this is a sealed
system<00:00:21.570> here<00:00:22.230> that<00:00:22.859> starts<00:00:23.369> at<00:00:23.519> that<00:00:23.670> or<00:00:23.939> here

system here that starts at that or here

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.650 
system here that starts at that or here
and<00:00:24.480> if<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:25.439> get<00:00:25.560> swimmers<00:00:26.099> here<00:00:26.550> swelling<00:00:27.510> a

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
and if you get swimmers here swelling a

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.859 
and if you get swimmers here swelling a
foreign<00:00:28.170> body<00:00:28.439> or<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:29.039> wax<00:00:29.369> impaction<00:00:30.179> that<00:00:30.660> can

the<00:00:33.180> ear<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.690> best<00:00:34.410> way<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.649> figure<00:00:34.920> this<00:00:35.010> out

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
the ear the best way to figure this out

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.760 
the ear the best way to figure this out
is<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.820> let<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.120> doctor<00:00:36.329> get<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.719> look<00:00:37.050> at<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.590> ear

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
is to let a doctor get a look at the ear

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.680 
is to let a doctor get a look at the ear
canal<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.370> see<00:00:39.000> if<00:00:39.120> there's<00:00:39.329> actually

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
canal and see if there's actually

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.090 
canal and see if there's actually
something<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.079> needs<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.530> be<00:00:40.559> treated
