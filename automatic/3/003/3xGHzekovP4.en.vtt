00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 
badly I suck the first tip would be

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.480 
badly I suck the first tip would be
practice<00:06:09.169> I've<00:06:09.409> said<00:06:09.650> this<00:06:09.770> a<00:06:09.800> thousand<00:06:10.460> times

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:10.490 
practice I've said this a thousand times

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.089 
practice I've said this a thousand times
before<00:06:11.000> but<00:06:11.210> it<00:06:11.330> bears<00:06:11.360> saying<00:06:11.960> again<00:06:12.320> you<00:06:12.860> can

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:13.099 
before but it bears saying again you can

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:15.969 
before but it bears saying again you can
only<00:06:13.460> ever<00:06:13.940> get<00:06:14.389> as<00:06:14.599> good<00:06:14.690> as<00:06:15.169> how<00:06:15.650> much<00:06:15.800> you

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:15.979 
only ever get as good as how much you

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:18.279 
only ever get as good as how much you
practice<00:06:16.159> the<00:06:16.610> more<00:06:16.759> time<00:06:17.060> you<00:06:17.210> put<00:06:17.449> in<00:06:17.810> the

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:37.340 
you should probably be shooting

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.300 
you should probably be shooting
somewhere<00:06:38.060> in<00:06:38.210> the<00:06:38.270> ballpark<00:06:38.390> of<00:06:38.890> 800<00:06:39.890> hours

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:40.310

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:44.510 
it well then I would probably take a

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.150 
it well then I would probably take a
step<00:06:44.780> back<00:06:44.930> and<00:06:45.080> reassess<00:06:45.410> what<00:06:45.830> you<00:06:45.920> want<00:06:46.100> to
