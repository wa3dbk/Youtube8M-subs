00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:07.490
 [Music] 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:10.099
 how about youtube my name is for you 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.379
 so this is mobile are today I bring you a 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:15.889
 Brief review of what is custom 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:17.660
 role of windows 8 for samsung galaxy 6 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:21.290
 As you can see now I'm not going to 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:24.590
 show in more detail and is 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:26.870
 currently angry phones 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.310
 nokia mobiles exist better done the 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.730
 processed operating system the 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:34.220
 mobile nokia rather the lumia family 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.520
 what I bring to you is a rom 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.140
 that is, the mobile does not stop being Android 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.910
 and now I'm going to show you some 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.540
 details of this rom but it's very 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.700
 interesting is disguised very well 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.670
 windows 8 interface so let's go to 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.530
 see what you think 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.370
 good now that we start with the 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.680
 review of the custom rom 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.950
 here we are going to unblock the cell phone as 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:04.239
 can see the start 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:07.710
 the start is very very is identical to that of 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:10.409
 windows 18 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.049
 although with some details that make 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.119
 Note that the phone has no system 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.440
 factory operative for example the 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:22.780
 rector will have to come with the windows 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:26.000
 the margin of windows with 4 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.280
 although this I prefer the project since 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.800
 applications for phones with 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.360
 operative resolutions with very bad and 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:37.320
 I say it because I've seen many phones 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.320
 as well said 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.740
 this 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.440
 change the color 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.060
 [Music] 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.630
 you can change things with two 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.630
 screens 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.940
 for putting him 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:05.000
 [Applause] 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:07.520
 for our new configuration now 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.500
 I'm going to show you something that I liked what 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.950
 I like that it is very fast 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.980
 mobile 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.720
 this is quite sustainable not only 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.720
 we can move it at our whim 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:27.000
 [Music] 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:29.370
 being here again you can 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.240
 account quite the subject of the 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.710
 space between each square this time 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.090
 it's quite interesting 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:40.770
 here are the applications that can 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:44.110
 change this list mode with 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.670
 grids and castel big icons 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.940
 the 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.250
 the hardware wind and g1 another of the 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.370
 flaws is that many icons are 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:58.810
 shares with with android for example 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:01.540
 you cameras downloads and from time to time 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.480
 when up appears in the bar 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.819
 notifications queue with the battery this 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.950
 there are times when it appears appears 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:12.750
 the same way of android works the 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:16.030
 can be more Android phones 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.069
 but so despite the criticism it is 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:22.090
 quite interesting romantic capitalist 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:25.030
 just to see how it was for 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.370
 curiosity nothing that someone something that I 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:31.810
 Interested enough is the following 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.210
 one can go in there one can 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.130
 select 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.630
 that the applications that are in the 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.400
 external memory directly without 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.160
 memory partition or anything 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.830
 thickness I liked and something that I also 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.600
 liked is that it frees up a lot of space in 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.640
 the internal memory since we do not have 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.590
 so many bills invoices though 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.410
 it seems that yes no 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.390
 now they are going to see that he goes to the bar of 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.810
 is 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.980
 52 the baby and done that update all 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.460
 many applications 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:07.580
 [Music] 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:11.960
 until a while ago I had 70 mb something that 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:14.060
 with android I'm never going to be good 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.380
 long as for mendez 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.709
 however, to look like a 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.709
 TV 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.770
 and well this if we get with my masters 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.500
 we have the little sign 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.910
 press if you select the application that 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.610
 I would have to go there ours because only 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.289
 that is, we press the internet and we 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:35.100
 dismissed application selection that said 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:36.720
 that is here and good now only in the 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.370
 description I'm going to leave the link for 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.650
 install it 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.169
 for those who know how to install it 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:47.750
 because I only encourage myself to make a video 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:47.750
 explaining why being something wrong 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.110
 with our users is that I do not know either 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.820
 if it would have to be but good something that 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:59.970
 because I like it is that despite having 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.500
 this this windows 8 interface the 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.060
 applications have their own 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.210
 from android since android just want 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.210
 what 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.960
 so good tonight not think 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.070
 that will show you to remove the more your 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.710
 weather 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.180
 this is all already have seen now 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.980
 we do in the camera that is the last thing 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:25.540
 that would be more or less worth 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:27.430
 show them this is the one that comes 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.950
 by default to the dolphin browser 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.640
 [Music] 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.640
 there was a photo 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:41.690
 this collection this is proper of 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:43.790
 the hearts in which will appear the 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:47.660
 coquito Ã¡vila last tank taken from 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:49.990
 down I like this last round not 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.990
 I had 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.030
 I'm going to look for new rom 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:02.110
 this rambla I recommend but of you 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:15.000
 by default it is very fast 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:19.100
 there is no need to show why 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.100
 windows interfacing 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.050
 it does not finish to convince me but it is 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:25.110
 acceptable 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.110
 [Music] 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:31.820
 this is that we stay pure or android 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:33.870
 4.2.1 that they want to call us 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.880
 [Music] 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:41.400
 and there appears another type of bar 

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.400
 notification bar tools 

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:46.869
 so I fly 

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:53.840
 I hope this video should be useful 

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:54.560
 I recommend it is more than anything 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.689
 do 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.479
 so they can see how it is but I do not know if it is 

00:06:56.689 --> 00:07:01.310
 very very practical of livestock is very 

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:03.909
 practice to have it for life 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:06.830
 daily so good this was all 

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:10.879
 I hope you have served them 

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:12.319
 I like it and subscribe good this 

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:16.779
 is all for today 

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:16.779
 and these dead until the next
