an<00:05:50.380> easy<00:05:50.530> game<00:05:50.800> but<00:05:51.159> not<00:05:51.280> too<00:05:51.460> hard<00:05:51.729> and<00:05:51.909> it's<00:05:52.570> a

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
an easy game but not too hard and it's a

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.980 
an easy game but not too hard and it's a
