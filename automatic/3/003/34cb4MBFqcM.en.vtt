00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
really confusing so I just wanted to

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.720 
really confusing so I just wanted to
clarify<00:02:27.180> that<00:02:28.180> you<00:02:28.269> was<00:02:28.359> placed<00:02:28.599> in<00:02:28.810> groups<00:02:29.109> of

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
clarify that you was placed in groups of

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.699 
clarify that you was placed in groups of
depend<00:02:30.730> on<00:02:30.819> your<00:02:30.939> clan<00:02:31.209> the<00:02:31.329> size<00:02:31.540> if<00:02:32.469> you<00:02:32.650> were

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
depend on your clan the size if you were

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:33.899 
depend on your clan the size if you were
only<00:02:32.859> two<00:02:33.040> clan<00:02:33.310> members<00:02:33.579> you<00:02:33.670> wouldnt<00:02:33.879> place

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:33.909 
only two clan members you wouldnt place

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:36.209 
only two clan members you wouldnt place
in<00:02:34.180> a<00:02:34.239> group<00:02:34.420> to<00:02:34.719> other<00:02:34.900> two<00:02:35.049> members<00:02:35.799> and

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:36.219 
in a group to other two members and

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:38.039 
in a group to other two members and
stuff<00:02:36.489> like<00:02:36.700> that<00:02:36.760> so<00:02:37.150> I<00:02:37.180> think<00:02:37.389> the<00:02:37.659> grouping

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
stuff like that so I think the grouping

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.530 
stuff like that so I think the grouping
went<00:02:38.260> two<00:02:38.469> three<00:02:38.769> four<00:02:39.010> five<00:02:39.219> six<00:02:39.280> seven<00:02:39.879> then

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
went two three four five six seven then

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.209 
went two three four five six seven then
it<00:02:40.659> jumped<00:02:40.989> nine<00:02:41.170> eleven<00:02:41.769> twelve<00:02:42.099> thirteen

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:42.219 
it jumped nine eleven twelve thirteen

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:44.369 
it jumped nine eleven twelve thirteen
and<00:02:42.609> so<00:02:43.090> on<00:02:43.239> until<00:02:43.389> the<00:02:43.599> maximum<00:02:43.989> was<00:02:44.109> reached

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 
and so on until the maximum was reached

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:48.780 
and so on until the maximum was reached
