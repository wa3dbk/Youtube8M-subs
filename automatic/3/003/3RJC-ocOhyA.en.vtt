00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
first and like as you can see some of

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.310 
first and like as you can see some of
them<00:00:37.519> like<00:00:37.699> home<00:00:38.180> sweet<00:00:38.210> home<00:00:38.600> is<00:00:38.720> a<00:00:38.750> thousand

points<00:00:39.500> just<00:00:39.860> because<00:00:40.070> it's<00:00:40.220> so<00:00:40.460> difficult<00:00:40.729> so

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
points just because it's so difficult so

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:42.910 
points just because it's so difficult so
i'm<00:00:41.690> going<00:00:41.809> to<00:00:41.870> start<00:00:42.049> off<00:00:42.290> because<00:00:42.589> i<00:00:42.620> did<00:00:42.830> the

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
i'm going to start off because i did the

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.860 
i'm going to start off because i did the
wayne<00:00:43.070> gretzky<00:00:43.400> one<00:00:43.519> it<00:00:43.640> was<00:00:43.699> 200<00:00:44.180> and<00:00:44.360> i'm

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
wayne gretzky one it was 200 and i'm

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.149 
wayne gretzky one it was 200 and i'm
going<00:00:45.019> to<00:00:45.080> basically<00:00:45.440> go<00:00:45.710> through<00:00:45.739> all<00:00:46.040> the

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:46.159 
going to basically go through all the

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:47.920 
going to basically go through all the
100<00:00:46.670> levels<00:00:47.089> and<00:00:47.330> then<00:00:47.479> i'll<00:00:47.570> go<00:00:47.600> through<00:00:47.839> all

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
100 levels and then i'll go through all

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.930 
100 levels and then i'll go through all
the<00:00:48.019> 200<00:00:48.470> and<00:00:48.589> then<00:00:48.799> I<00:00:49.010> think<00:00:49.159> it's<00:00:49.280> 400<00:00:49.790> and

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
the 200 and then I think it's 400 and

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.799 
the 200 and then I think it's 400 and
such<00:00:50.260> so<00:00:51.260> the<00:00:51.350> first<00:00:51.559> 100<00:00:52.159> level<00:00:52.400> will<00:00:52.610> be

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
such so the first 100 level will be

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.680 
such so the first 100 level will be
