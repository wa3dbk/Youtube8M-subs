 self-help personal development coach 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.859
 what technologist is your guide to the world 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.269
 luck and fulfillment of desires and today 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.010
 we will talk with you about how to 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.719
 save and save as 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.210
 to save and save money with 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.029
 point of view of our unconscious then 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.529
 there is how to do it technologically and psycho 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.730
 I'll say right away that you save money 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.050
 save money in terms of 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.060
 unconscious psychology is in 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.519
 the principle is normal to save correctly and 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.230
 save money for something or just 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.179
 run them in a job invest in 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.800
 something to put under the percentage that is to 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.340
 they worked because money is all 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.820
 flow you they love momentum if your 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.620
 money 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.660
 stagnate for example you buy them 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.579
 just under the pillow as a rule your 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.219
 life there are some problems where 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.780
 this money and merge or appear 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.789
 some relatives and acquaintances who 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.579
 eventually borrow this money can then 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.379
 by the way and do not return them I think you are familiar 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.090
 all these situations are more than sure even 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.430
 that anything like this is life ever 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.079
 yes it happened but it is a separate topic for 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.030
 conversation we are here to develop this topic is not 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.680
 we will not develop as well as the topic 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.170
 investing other correct scheme 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.360
 work with money we'll talk a little bit 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.310
 another thing is that so many people 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.380
 save money for reasons 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.390
 some kind of security on verbal 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.640
 level it usually sounds with such 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.759
 terms like airbag or 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.740
 what's more disastrous for a rainy day and 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.320
 let's consider what happens here 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.299
 going on in our psy and how it responds 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.280
 on this is our unconscious 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.350
 It turns out that when we 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.390
 save money for a rainy day there and 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.640
 Essentially we program in my head 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.280
 that such a situation is such a day that is 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.290
 a rainy day sometime come 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.060
 what happens next you all probably 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.650
 know who doesn't know that know what 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.579
 performance psycho techniques 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.530
 desires 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.200
 after you are technologically advanced 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.570
 make a wish 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.729
 let go that is stop steaming by 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.350
 about her performance then she 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.180
 quality falls into 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.250
 unconscious and starts 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.229
 be realized your life 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.479
 reality in our case with money 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.280
 about the same thing happens here 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.950
 assume that you have in life can 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.020
 come some black day postponing 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.110
 on him some money that is create 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.890
 some airbag 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.060
 and putting aside this money you kind of like 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.790
 calm down stop bathing 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.100
 about this black day and right here 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.130
 the worst comes your 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.690
 unconscious unconscious 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.850
 perceives this situation like this 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.650
 same as with the fulfillment of desires she 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.900
 of course she understands that itâ€™s a rainy day 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.360
 bad because someone else but she 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.910
 cares about your safety first 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.070
 turn but she sees that you are ready for 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.490
 this black day you have postponed for him 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:43.250
 some money and your best interest and 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.020
 since you are at the level of your consciousness so 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.870
 sure that he is a rainy day 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.090
 sure your life will happen and feet 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.250
 brings him closer to you as soon as possible 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.010
 passed him and lived a happy life 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.930
 without these notorious black days and this 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.940
 black shadow well then there are any there 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.970
 problems in life for example fired you with 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.280
 work it comes into your life and you all 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.580
 this money that was on him 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.739
 deposited on him and merge that 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.300
 happens then later most people 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.830
 instead of doing some 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.690
 correct conclusions and no longer 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.880
 set aside for a rainy day 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.590
 for some reason begins to think that one time 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.170
 such a rainy day happened this will happen 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.910
 and the other one and again start putting off on 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.820
 your next rainy day 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.970
 your money and thus fall into 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.980
 a loop of my own negative experiences and this 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.959
 by the way very relevant information like 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.930
 once in our time when some yard 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.880
 another crisis with might and main are rampant 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.860
 some sanctions falls ruble expensive 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.720
 dollar increase in the price, and so on that is 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.330
 this is the time when so many 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.130
 people can get into this horrible black 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.950
 trap how to do right and 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.140
 ask you answer everything is very simple 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.980
 don't save money right 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.430
 rainy day 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.830
 and let's say on a white day what is 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.630
 white day we are by no means 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.519
 set even once in the black day 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.120
 white day is when in your life 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.820
 will come 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.430
 abundance and prosperity you will fall into 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.500
 some kind of cash flow that you are in your 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.299
 Life, in principle, stop steaming 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.980
 about money they will always be with you 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:14.630
 will come to you constantly to 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.859
 ensure you your comfortable and 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.060
 quality of life 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:20.009
 accordingly when you money 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.389
 set aside for a white day then in your 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:23.449
 unconscious happens about 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.349
 the same processes as with the black day 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:27.810
 unconsciously understands that you are 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:30.479
 program yourself this white day she 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.819
 his life begins to attract 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:35.280
 and your deposits for this day are yours 

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:36.930
 humble friendly conscious 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.699
 participating in this magnificent work on 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.189
 bringing your life abundance 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:43.020
 prosperity well and actually that means 

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:45.210
 set aside for a white day it means that 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.370
 when this day is yours 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.949
 accumulation will be more like and not 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.110
 need you calmly take it off 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:54.479
 from your bank account there for example 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.490
 and recommend spending it somehow 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:58.919
 in a joyful and helpful way in honor 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.050
 of your mighty unconscious therefore 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:03.960
 save and save money correctly 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:06.449
 forget the dark days just think about 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.729
 whites is one of the positive elements 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:11.400
 thinking is one of the elements of working with 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:13.229
 their limiting beliefs and this 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.360
 an important attraction element in your life 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:17.490
 and scored prosperity actually this 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.699
 such an internal driver that will 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.289
 move you in that direction 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:24.870
 the only thing I will add is not to try 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:27.509
 deceive your unconscious and yourself 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.460
 it is necessary to postpone yourself clearly and truly 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:32.190
 on a white day they cover formally 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.620
 this is your fear of the future your fear 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.599
