00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:13.460
 you can even play it by the way 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:20.279
 cool cool option 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:22.380
 Yes, it will be necessary to come up with something 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.410
 so you saw so that the egg so 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:31.080
 led 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:33.320
 it's just a paragraph it's not me really not a ball 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.320
 and them 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:46.790
 won to how much it so now I can 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:52.760
 still take a natural egg what are you 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:01:05.619
 saw shorter clear jumped 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:08.869
 and here it is already visible yes here it is soup 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:10.490
 here's the calcium all gone and the shell 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:14.930
 this is left 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:18.310
 it happened one day shorter 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:22.250
 You can take this option 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:27.220
 let's say and argue that my egg will be 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:32.649
 bounce like this and will not break 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:37.160
 argue well come here and now 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:40.640
 that it was clear that this is not no balls 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:47.450
 egg I'll just cut through it now 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:49.819
 see here is how did this egg 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.920
 but we will not eat him of course because 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:59.780
 what a bunch of here 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:02:05.739
 I do not know, but you were aware that 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:08.360
 it turns out if you throw an egg in vinegar 

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:13.510
 all success subscribe to the channel 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.510
 there are many interesting experiments ahead
