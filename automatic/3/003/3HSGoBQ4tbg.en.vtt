00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:10.999
 mimmo 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.759
 now let's start with the tagliatelle then let's make the dough 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:29.689
 200 grams of flour and put two eggs because the recipe is 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.810
 cont a new every 100 grams of flour 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.910
 problem we have and share the eggs because they don't always have the same 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:38.740
 weight 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.920
 and consequently we keep a small amount of flour 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.510
 because we add only if necessary the eggs we steal apart not 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.210
 directly into the dough because if there was a man 8 flop it 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.210
 throw away everything was a security 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.600
 you can even do it directly with your hands, we prefer to do it directly 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.710
 first with a fork 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.810
 because it is easier and then boh. we will use our hands 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.060
 ecm 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.830
 movement to bring inside 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.230
 and the flour a little at a time to mix it 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.740
 and all this time also serves to bring air convent 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.940
 in the dough the mixture that will come 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.860
 pe worked for quite a while this is the most important phase the first aspect 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.510
 because from this dough there is not working a lot starting from starting 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.310
 that the process is older than gluten 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.570
 that villa 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.090
 in the guardian triggered this 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.400
 doing then bring it back 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.900
 the bed is 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.710
 the beer we get product 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.710
 very elastic that does not break 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.530
 the difference between 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.070
 but this pasta is that of semolina is made only with water and note 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.660
 elasticity. 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.660
 of the product 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.199
 let's say that this type of work takes 15 to 20 minutes 

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:16.649
 we must get to work this does not need strength is just a matter 

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:20.929
 of movement from we have to prenatal external bring it inward 

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:21.910
 cover it 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.490
 ie the way that t. pasta, pasta of the same type of movement 

00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:31.409
 d we had to work as long as 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:34.229
 as long as the surface becomes smooth 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:38.679
 e and elastic and elasticity have the bull eyes we attest 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.349
 spigelon vico according to the speed with which you speak with an endorsement 

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:50.290
 and we worked it with glue 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.149
 and now it should be about we do a test 

00:02:54.149 --> 00:03:00.559
 here ask for it enough elastic and consequently we put it to rest 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:03.329
 hospitalized at least 20 minutes 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:09.819
 re or half an hour we put it on a plate on a surface and lissia 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.760
 not on the wooden legs sobre would take away the moisture 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.219
 which instead serves to keep it elastic 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:18.159
 the soft 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:24.009
 here it is pasta type since we are continuing s ... spoken with a rolling pin 

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:30.659
 at this point we will be able to learn many things with the tfa machine 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:33.779
 this function is formed by coloring 

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:36.789
 to these things without 

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:38.739
 shalalalalalala 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.129
 the custom of making the dough roll out the pearl expired auction 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:49.319
 com + computer manages to make a perfect bottom it rains good even if on average 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.799
 do not need for that type the brood - it is all pasta that must be cut and of 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:55.289
 consequence indeed 

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:58.099
 computer to buy the more we waste it 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.409
 it's not a problem because you don't boast it's not a minute used to do 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:06.519
 and pasta and beans always make us from the center outwards without arriving 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:09.529
 aphids ford or why 

00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:13.949
 going down it would go to crush profile power go 2 levels 

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:17.030
 wise to try to always have the same level 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:23.630
 hey acquire the power to have it not bigger than a109 and lower because 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.630
 after a year it is more possible to enlarge 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.550
 when we have problems 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.119
 king of roundness that does more damage 4 lovato is used 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.940
 the village tel if the rolling pin that had a figure on the punk side 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.610
 create recover the part of the circumference. 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.219
 now we understand that he cannot forget that he has the right thickness 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.400
 and we are not set up because you have to look for a person 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.680
 if the population on to cut them the noodles would stick instead 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.229
 we have to count and make sure that ccr5 melts a moment after the 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:08.090
 offer 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.750
 and let's cut some canonical measure 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.550
 of tagliatelle with the tester 87 the dough 

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:18.199
 announcements are slightly discarded 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:23.800
 too much because otherwise it would break we can to the popular but so that 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.800
 don't stick 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.710
 now we have changed with this special knife that has no tip but 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.680
 square and made just to cut the noodles 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.719
 self 

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:37.250
 we support the Rome 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.520
 to the notes and not to pay the fingers 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.870
 and the noodle is cut 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.080
 Heera 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:51.189
 termination of you I repeat 0 8 if true, 8 centimeters 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:55.759
 this is the card canon measure 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:05:59.979
 they contain only with milk 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.580
 mss scale 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.610
 can be done at the nest 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:06.529
 but 

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:08.839
 you can't depend on when 

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:12.509
 after how long they are cooked and eaten
