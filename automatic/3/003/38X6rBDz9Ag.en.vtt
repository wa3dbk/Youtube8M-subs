basically<00:03:00.200> you<00:03:00.410> start<00:03:00.770> up<00:03:01.010> the<00:03:01.040> engine<00:03:01.220> and

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
basically you start up the engine and

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.670 
basically you start up the engine and
you<00:03:02.030> pinch<00:03:02.360> the<00:03:02.600> fuel<00:03:02.810> lines<00:03:02.990> to<00:03:03.110> see<00:03:03.260> how<00:03:03.470> long

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
you pinch the fuel lines to see how long

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.760 
you pinch the fuel lines to see how long
it<00:03:03.860> takes<00:03:03.890> really<00:03:04.760> engine<00:03:05.180> to<00:03:05.300> quit<00:03:05.570> and<00:03:06.290> the

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
it takes really engine to quit and the

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.670 
it takes really engine to quit and the
ideal<00:03:07.250> I<00:03:07.520> miss<00:03:08.330> reading<00:03:08.510> a<00:03:08.750> setting<00:03:09.170> is<00:03:09.410> where

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
ideal I miss reading a setting is where

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.790 
ideal I miss reading a setting is where
the<00:03:10.250> engines<00:03:10.670> to<00:03:10.880> take<00:03:10.910> around<00:03:11.450> 3<00:03:12.080> seconds<00:03:12.590> to

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
the engines to take around 3 seconds to

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.100 
the engines to take around 3 seconds to
quit<00:03:15.610> if<00:03:16.610> it<00:03:16.790> cuts<00:03:17.360> off<00:03:17.540> straightaway<00:03:17.840> you

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
quit if it cuts off straightaway you

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.900 
quit if it cuts off straightaway you
file<00:03:18.350> a<00:03:18.380> lien<00:03:18.620> setting<00:03:19.100> if<00:03:19.190> it<00:03:19.310> takes<00:03:19.490> ages<00:03:19.670> to

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
file a lien setting if it takes ages to

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:42.190 
file a lien setting if it takes ages to
quit<00:03:20.180> that<00:03:20.660> means<00:03:20.900> you<00:03:20.990> have<00:03:21.140> a<00:03:21.170> rich

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.760 

that<00:03:43.190> was<00:03:43.310> about<00:03:43.490> six<00:03:43.550> seconds<00:03:44.420> so<00:03:45.200> in<00:03:45.650> order

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
that was about six seconds so in order

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.949 
that was about six seconds so in order
to<00:03:45.950> sort<00:03:46.610> this<00:03:46.730> out<00:03:46.910> you<00:03:47.180> see<00:03:47.360> it<00:03:47.420> took<00:03:47.569> a<00:03:47.720> long

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
to sort this out you see it took a long

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.660 
to sort this out you see it took a long
long<00:03:48.260> time<00:03:48.560> to<00:03:49.780> stop<00:03:50.780> so<00:03:51.110> turn<00:03:51.680> the<00:03:51.980> low-speed

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
long time to stop so turn the low-speed

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.510 
long time to stop so turn the low-speed
needle<00:03:53.120> that<00:03:53.690> is<00:03:53.750> the<00:03:53.989> one<00:03:54.140> given<00:03:54.620> here<00:03:54.860> touch

one<00:03:55.910> eighth<00:03:56.239> of<00:03:56.270> a<00:03:56.510> turn<00:03:56.690> clockwise<00:03:57.140> just<00:03:59.050> one

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 
one eighth of a turn clockwise just one

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:16.570 
one eighth of a turn clockwise just one
return

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:16.580 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:21.710 

was<00:04:17.580> about<00:04:17.900> earlier<00:04:20.540> remember<00:04:21.540> we're<00:04:21.690> looking

was about earlier remember we're looking

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.880 
was about earlier remember we're looking
at<00:04:22.080> it<00:04:22.200> to<00:04:22.320> stop

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
at it to stop

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:40.860 
at it to stop
in<00:04:23.280> about<00:04:23.520> three<00:04:24.090> seconds

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.900 

okay<00:04:41.870> so<00:04:42.260> that<00:04:42.560> seems<00:04:42.980> like<00:04:43.190> we<00:04:43.430> have<00:04:43.580> a<00:04:43.610> good

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
okay so that seems like we have a good

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.210 
okay so that seems like we have a good
setting<00:04:44.360> now<00:04:44.540> I<00:04:44.840> wanna<00:04:45.440> leave<00:04:45.650> it<00:04:45.680> running<00:04:45.890> Rex

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220
