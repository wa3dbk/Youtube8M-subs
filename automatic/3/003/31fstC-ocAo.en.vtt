understand and imagine which is
difficult<00:00:45.290> to<00:00:45.650> do<00:00:45.860> is<00:00:46.760> that<00:00:47.090> everybody<00:00:47.630> had<00:00:47.870> to

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
difficult to do is that everybody had to

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.480 
difficult to do is that everybody had to
come<00:00:48.490> to<00:00:49.490> monotype<00:00:50.060> if<00:00:50.300> they<00:00:50.480> had<00:00:50.740> a<00:00:51.740> logo<00:00:52.460> that

we've all got copper letter patterns
here<00:01:20.960> whether<00:01:21.950> it's<00:01:22.159> chess<00:01:23.409> anything<00:01:24.409> you

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
here whether it's chess anything you

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.130 
here whether it's chess anything you
care<00:01:24.950> to<00:01:25.010> think<00:01:25.400> of<00:01:25.610> had<00:01:26.210> to<00:01:26.360> come<00:01:26.570> to<00:01:26.720> monitor

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
care to think of had to come to monitor

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.940 
care to think of had to come to monitor
and<00:01:28.780> it's<00:01:29.780> not<00:01:29.930> something<00:01:30.200> that<00:01:30.500> normally

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
here's capital letter U for example well

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.429 
here's capital letter U for example well
this<00:02:07.159> is<00:02:07.280> all<00:02:07.430> just<00:02:07.700> years<00:02:08.030> yeah<00:02:08.479> just<00:02:08.810> use<00:02:09.019> if

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:09.439 
this is all just years yeah just use if

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:11.920 
this is all just years yeah just use if
you<00:02:09.590> think<00:02:09.649> about<00:02:09.950> it<00:02:10.340> companies<00:02:10.879> depended<00:02:11.810> on

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
you think about it companies depended on

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.039 
you think about it companies depended on
monotype<00:02:12.500> rather<00:02:12.920> like<00:02:13.280> we<00:02:14.120> all<00:02:14.269> now<00:02:14.569> depend

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 
monotype rather like we all now depend

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:18.550 
monotype rather like we all now depend
on<00:02:15.230> electronics<00:02:15.889> to<00:02:16.099> do<00:02:16.219> things<00:02:16.519> for<00:02:17.269> us<00:02:17.560> they

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
on electronics to do things for us they

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.300 
on electronics to do things for us they
were<00:02:18.620> a<00:02:18.709> force<00:02:19.040> of

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
were a force of

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.780 
were a force of
nature<00:02:20.980> and<00:02:21.980> I<00:02:22.099> don't<00:02:22.310> think<00:02:22.580> they<00:02:22.670> ever

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
nature and I don't think they ever

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.030 
nature and I don't think they ever
realized<00:02:23.330> how<00:02:23.510> important<00:02:24.080> they<00:02:24.230> were<00:02:24.260> or<00:02:25.069> how

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
realized how important they were or how

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.229 
realized how important they were or how
fundamentally<00:02:28.040> they<00:02:28.220> affected<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:28.790> human

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
fundamentally they affected the human

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.680 
fundamentally they affected the human
race<00:02:29.420> I<00:02:29.720> think<00:02:29.930> they<00:02:30.080> were<00:02:30.250> just<00:02:31.390> like<00:02:32.390> any

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
race I think they were just like any

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.770 
race I think they were just like any
normal<00:02:32.840> business<00:02:33.760> making<00:02:34.760> a<00:02:34.849> profit<00:02:35.120> and

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
normal business making a profit and

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:44.050 
normal business making a profit and
