00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.110
 the side 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.940
 welcome today we are going to make cookies 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.910
 I hope you like it and that we enjoy 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.590
 everyone, see you later 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.590
 these are the ingredients 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.570
 we incorporate the butter and beat it 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.570
 well until it is well creamy 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.550
 we incorporate the icing sugar that 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.050
 previously it has to be sifted without 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.270
 lumps 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.090
 we beat well until everything is fine 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.160
 incorporated we add the aroma this time 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.410
 I have chosen coconut aroma that remains 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.980
 great 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.870
 we beat it we incorporated two eggs 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.590
 two eggs you can beat them previously 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.590
 a little 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.710
 you add them to the mixture 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.300
 and beat it is all very well until it gives 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.300
 more is fully incorporated 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.140
 let's add the flour gradually 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:15.340
 to teaspoons and mixing well 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:19.679
 you can first use it with a shovel 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.679
 and then you can finish with the hands 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.900
 when the dough is finished 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.270
 We distribute and wrap it in film 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.920
 we keep it in the fridge at least 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.920
 three hours before working it 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.179
 we stretch the dough as you will see this dough 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:53.859
 it's with chocolate that in the next video 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:56.530
 I will teach you how to make our cookies 

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:58.780
 with chocolate we stretch it well with 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.399
 our roller and we take the cutter and 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.929
 we started cutting with the shapes that 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.630
 more we like these are reasons 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:07.030
 Christmas we put them in the tray 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.580
 be careful that some are separated 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.720
 among the others so that once in the 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.720
 oven do not stick 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.800
 We preheat the oven to 175 degrees and 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.680
 we bake for 15 minutes to this 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.930
 temperature 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.930
 we let them cool before decorating 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.310
 but things 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.310
 Y
