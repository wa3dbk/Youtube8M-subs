 Silver commenting and good first of all 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.460
 I wanted to tell you that it is not uploaded 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.200
 no video during all this time 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.440
 a week I think it has not gone up 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.150
 videos for a few reasons the 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.920
 first the computer is not going 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.439
 well enough to climb the 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.109
 videos to the contrary if you do not fuck everything 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.880
 computer just turn it on for a 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.949
 time or read the messages that you leave me 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.199
 that's why some comments 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.730
 responded sent some videos in 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.340
 youtube that still leaves me the 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.200
 computer equally and good is the 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.870
 first case the second one wanted to upload the 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.680
 videos 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:42.500
 the calculator in the xbox and I was going to 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.420
 buy modern warfare 2 as it is 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.329
 one of the games one of the only ones that 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.430
 admits for 52 he was going to rise but not 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.410
 there was no store either so 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:55.030
 if you see a misfortune and good 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:57.890
 I will probably ask for the windows xp 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.740
 professional the disk to install it 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:04.500
 all over again the lunnis computer 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.150
 and see how good today but I get no 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.960
 we are here today we are here to 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.960
 show you a video 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.850
 well I will not be in minecraft but 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:14.740
 which is nothing else I'm going to teach because I see 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.380
 that there are many people who know how to do this 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.149
 so I'll teach you how to go to the 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.549
 moon in minecraft to make a portal 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:26.170
 the moon I will leave in the description of 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:28.970
 minecraft dot net and good here you have 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.180
 a few screenshots 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.490
 this is the moon in the portals love you 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.070
 here it says that it is compatible with the mold 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.930
 martel morpheus here you have some videos 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.930
 but if you do not know how to install it 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.970
 of the gamer boot have of minecraft mother 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.760
 and after casting the moon and some mold 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.070
 how many videos of him and good before 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.370
 nothing to build blocks of to 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.140
 go or are these same blocks to make 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:57.230
 portal the first thing we have to do 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.350
 it's milk cubes because of course you think 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:02.570
 with six cubes or nine cubes 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.300
 putting all what it is to create 'aces' 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.610
 two cheese blocks and that in your 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.770
 just like you but with cheese also that 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.450
 they will include you the mop you can create the 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.610
 blocks equally and with four blocks 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.220
 of good cheese with four pieces of 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.520
 clear cheese a block then you can 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.860
 create walls reinforced with wool and in 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.990
 gold block in the middle it 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.880
 they will create eight reinforced walls 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.420
 It seems like a good idea because you do not spend 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.420
 both battery 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:36.810
 well then you can create 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:39.090
 spatial doors pieces with three 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.299
 Reinforced parts and a wooden door 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.019
 in the middle you can create 20 lamps with 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:48.750
 a rest in the middle two ingots of 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:50.760
 iron two crystals you can and then 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.069
 you can go creating the space suit that 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.319
 is with the wool reinforced with the part 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:58.950
 reinforced as you want to wear what good 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.810
 the helmet is created with five clear pieces 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.849
 with a helmet when you create a 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:08.099
 normal helmet the minecraft and putting in 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:12.500
 the middle of a crystal then the suit is 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.500
 it creates putting everything happening 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.630
 Reinforced wool and putting a block 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.580
 in the box in the middle above in the 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.170
 middle box below the middle no 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.000
 not the middle one, there you have to 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.260
 put the face above the middle and the 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.140
 down the middle 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.210
 then the pants you put as always 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.270
 normal ones but you remove the block of 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.690
 medium and the institute ispo ingots 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.060
 iron 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.940
 down all the iron blocks in 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:42.720
 the half-floor medium is up when 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:45.330
 you are going to create plantaron and down another two 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.430
 ingots then the shoes is the same as 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.650
 always also the only thing that changes is 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.760
 the top part instead of putting the 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.230
 same material 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.850
 the miners iron blocks and two 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.480
 reinforced blocks below and you're 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:04:00.060
 then you can create a sonic is richter 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.340
 which rain is to be able to go 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.560
 portal with this here you have the portal and 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:08.250
 you can 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:11.660
 activate it and the moon is created with a 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:15.130
 kind of spear all in line 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:18.580
 online jover 9 leaves now 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.650
 vertical two iron blocks 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:23.920
 forgive iron ingots and once 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:26.200
 rest to load the recharges with rest 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.690
 you usually put 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:32.050
 the gadget above and the rest below 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:34.710
 and only the materials are downloaded later 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.710
 like the sachet 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:41.629
 there has also been the weather boudou that 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.629
 I suppose it will be 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.569
 use the switch the sonic script 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:51.449
 driver is to be in relation to that 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:53.930
 that is created with blocks of 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:53.930
 if I see well 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.750
 with blocks of new materials that 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:02.340
 they will give you that it is a white ingot for 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.910
 up down and the middle you put the 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.290
 left water in the middle a block of 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.810
 new block of the new ones already together 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.820
 four complete everything rather not four 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.440
 sorry, you put the whole box together and with the 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.630
 new material I believe in block to see 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:19.040
 cast this then you can create a rocket 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:22.110
 core that is to build a rocket 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.249
 well this is built with 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.349
 juice of 

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:30.139
 games and what when you take for 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:32.749
 example me that I know flowers or whatever 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:34.520
 the portfolios and if I went looking for the 

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:36.860
 wool to value the color for the same 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.889
 but like cheese and you put three blocks 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.810
 of the new material and the rest in the 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:45.139
 medium and good also you have to the tnt 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.729
 but that already with new materials with the 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:49.789
 new gravel I think it's also process 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:51.560
 It is normal and good, this was not everything 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:56.180
 I wanted to teach the kids and give 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:06:00.020
 like favorites, comment and subscribe 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:03.439
 well before finishing the video left us 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:06.199

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:09.529
 commented that this model Monday for the 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:11.750
