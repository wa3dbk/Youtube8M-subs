going on today and you need to be very

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.920 
going on today and you need to be very
careful<00:02:22.440> about<00:02:22.770> it<00:02:23.100> I'm<00:02:23.310> not<00:02:23.550> aware<00:02:24.090> that<00:02:24.660> this

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
careful about it I'm not aware that this

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.470 
careful about it I'm not aware that this
would<00:02:25.200> become<00:02:25.380> an<00:02:26.480> indisputable

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
would become an indisputable

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.780 
would become an indisputable
archaeological<00:02:28.470> evidence<00:02:28.650> at<00:02:29.130> this<00:02:29.280> point<00:02:29.400> in

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
archaeological evidence at this point in

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.510 
archaeological evidence at this point in
time<00:02:29.820> I<00:02:30.330> don't<00:02:30.960> preclude<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.740> possibility<00:02:31.770> in

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520

the future but I think there's a lot of
sensationalism<00:02:34.710> that's<00:02:35.100> associated<00:02:35.460> this

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030
