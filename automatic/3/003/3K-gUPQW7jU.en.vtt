the<00:02:00.869> upper<00:02:01.140> here<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.740> it's<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.040> little<00:02:02.250> bit

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
the upper here and it's a little bit

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.590 
the upper here and it's a little bit
thicker<00:02:02.520> as<00:02:02.700> well<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:02.969> can<00:02:03.060> guys<00:02:03.210> see<00:02:03.390> through

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
thicker as well you can guys see through

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.050 
thicker as well you can guys see through
this<00:02:03.750> little<00:02:04.399> the<00:02:05.399> side<00:02:05.579> of<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.759> shoots<00:02:05.939> a

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
this little the side of the shoots a

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.219 
this little the side of the shoots a
little<00:02:06.270> bit<00:02:06.390> thicker<00:02:06.570> but<00:02:06.780> there's<00:02:06.960> not<00:02:07.049> much

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
little bit thicker but there's not much

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.930 
little bit thicker but there's not much
padding<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:07.799> as<00:02:07.920> well<00:02:08.099> so<00:02:08.340> you're<00:02:08.789> going<00:02:08.879> to

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
padding to it as well so you're going to

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.639 
padding to it as well so you're going to
have<00:02:09.000> not<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.690> barefoot<00:02:10.170> feel<00:02:10.319> but<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.560> can

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
have not a barefoot feel but you can

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.229 
have not a barefoot feel but you can
have<00:02:10.770> that<00:02:10.800> painting<00:02:11.220> feel<00:02:11.430> where<00:02:11.670> there's

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
have that painting feel where there's

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:12.720 
have that painting feel where there's
not

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
not

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.220 
not
much<00:02:12.849> padding<00:02:13.120> between<00:02:13.420> your<00:02:13.750> foot<00:02:13.930> and<00:02:14.110> the

my website you'll be able to get a
better<00:02:47.349> idea<00:02:47.440> of<00:02:47.739> how<00:02:47.920> that<00:02:47.980> actually<00:02:48.310> does

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
better idea of how that actually does

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.660 
better idea of how that actually does
look<00:02:48.750> but<00:02:49.750> um<00:02:49.959> and<00:02:50.379> how<00:02:51.069> it<00:02:51.160> actually<00:02:51.310> raises

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.409 
without rubbing away or wearing it way
too<00:04:10.959> fast<00:04:11.349> it's<00:04:11.949> partly<00:04:12.519> gum<00:04:12.790> rubber<00:04:13.000> it's

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:13.419 
too fast it's partly gum rubber it's

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:15.960 
too fast it's partly gum rubber it's
mixtures<00:04:13.870> of<00:04:13.900> harder<00:04:14.470> rubbers<00:04:14.799> as<00:04:14.949> well<00:04:15.160> so

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
mixtures of harder rubbers as well so

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.670 
mixtures of harder rubbers as well so
you<00:04:16.060> have<00:04:16.150> this<00:04:16.269> kind<00:04:16.449> of<00:04:16.570> diagonal<00:04:17.440> pattern

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
you have this kind of diagonal pattern

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.839 
you have this kind of diagonal pattern
running<00:04:18.099> through<00:04:18.250> here<00:04:18.430> which<00:04:18.579> is<00:04:18.699> going<00:04:18.789> to

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:18.849 
running through here which is going to

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:20.129 
running through here which is going to
provide<00:04:19.090> really<00:04:19.419> good<00:04:19.449> grip<00:04:19.750> as<00:04:19.870> far<00:04:20.049> as

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
provide really good grip as far as

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:21.839 
provide really good grip as far as
stopping<00:04:20.560> and<00:04:20.709> starting<00:04:20.859> then<00:04:21.549> you<00:04:21.669> have<00:04:21.760> this

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:21.849 
stopping and starting then you have this

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:23.370 
stopping and starting then you have this
crazy<00:04:22.150> pattern<00:04:22.599> running<00:04:22.870> through<00:04:23.020> the<00:04:23.110> inside

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
crazy pattern running through the inside

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.110 
crazy pattern running through the inside
which<00:04:23.560> a<00:04:23.650> lot<00:04:23.770> of<00:04:23.800> people<00:04:23.890> were<00:04:24.190> kind<00:04:25.030> of

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
which a lot of people were kind of

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.340 
which a lot of people were kind of
wondering<00:04:25.479> why<00:04:25.960> that

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
wondering why that

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.020 
wondering why that
there<00:04:26.560> and<00:04:26.950> I<00:04:27.280> found<00:04:27.430> that<00:04:27.610> really<00:04:27.670> didn't

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
there and I found that really didn't

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.310 
there and I found that really didn't
make<00:04:28.090> any<00:04:28.300> kind<00:04:28.450> of<00:04:28.540> difference<00:04:28.810> at<00:04:28.930> all<00:04:28.960> as

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
make any kind of difference at all as

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.010 
make any kind of difference at all as
far<00:04:29.530> as<00:04:29.910> traction<00:04:30.910> was<00:04:31.210> concerned<00:04:31.600> it's<00:04:31.840> kind

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
far as traction was concerned it's kind

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.360 
far as traction was concerned it's kind
of<00:04:32.050> just<00:04:32.170> there<00:04:32.350> to<00:04:32.380> look<00:04:32.650> cool<00:04:32.890> and<00:04:33.190> that's

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
of just there to look cool and that's

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.370 
of just there to look cool and that's
about<00:04:33.490> it<00:04:33.690> so<00:04:34.690> if<00:04:34.810> you're<00:04:34.930> wondering<00:04:35.050> what

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
about it so if you're wondering what

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.410 
about it so if you're wondering what
that<00:04:35.530> actually<00:04:35.830> does<00:04:35.890> as<00:04:36.190> far<00:04:36.370> as<00:04:36.520> doing

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:37.420 
that actually does as far as doing

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.000 
that actually does as far as doing
anything<00:04:37.750> at<00:04:38.020> all<00:04:38.050> it<00:04:38.380> really<00:04:38.650> doesn't<00:04:38.920> do

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
anything at all it really doesn't do

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.410 
anything at all it really doesn't do
anything<00:04:39.370> it's<00:04:39.550> pretty<00:04:39.790> much<00:04:39.940> just<00:04:40.000> there<00:04:40.390> for

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.420 
anything it's pretty much just there for

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.070 
anything it's pretty much just there for
looks<00:04:40.840> but<00:04:41.050> it's<00:04:41.890> one<00:04:42.070> of<00:04:42.160> those<00:04:42.280> try<00:04:43.080> Souls

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
looks but it's one of those try Souls

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.020 
looks but it's one of those try Souls
that's<00:04:44.290> going<00:04:44.440> to<00:04:44.500> withstand<00:04:44.980> really<00:04:45.820> well<00:04:46.000> on

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
that's going to withstand really well on

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.910 
that's going to withstand really well on
indoor<00:04:46.540> court<00:04:46.780> services<00:04:46.960> as<00:04:47.410> well<00:04:47.440> as<00:04:47.710> street
