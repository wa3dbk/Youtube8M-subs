00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.650 
tri-level texturing so it has three
different<00:01:45.070> levels<00:01:45.430> of<00:01:45.729> texture<00:01:46.180> on<00:01:46.210> awesome

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
different levels of texture on awesome

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.150 
different levels of texture on awesome
it<00:01:46.810> works<00:01:46.899> really<00:01:47.290> really<00:01:47.440> well<00:01:47.680> these<00:01:48.040> are

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
it works really really well these are

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.650 
it works really really well these are
the<00:01:48.220> prototypes<00:01:48.460> of<00:01:48.910> course<00:01:49.149> some<00:01:49.570> more

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660 
the prototypes of course some more

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.389 
the prototypes of course some more
close-up<00:01:50.080> shots<00:01:50.320> of<00:01:50.440> that<00:01:50.590> texture<00:01:50.860> possibly

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
close-up shots of that texture possibly

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:54.240 
close-up shots of that texture possibly
before<00:01:51.550> blade<00:01:51.910> show<00:01:52.210> okay<00:01:52.780> and<00:01:52.990> you<00:01:53.979> can<00:01:54.100> feel

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
before blade show okay and you can feel

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.620 
before blade show okay and you can feel
the<00:01:54.340> texture<00:01:54.550> it's<00:01:54.729> really<00:01:55.030> not<00:01:55.149> absolutely

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
the texture it's really not absolutely

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.749 
the texture it's really not absolutely
and<00:01:56.229> we're<00:01:56.710> going<00:01:56.830> to<00:01:56.860> put<00:01:57.040> good<00:01:57.220> steel<00:01:57.490> and

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
and we're going to put good steel and

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.370 
and we're going to put good steel and
I'm<00:01:57.850> it's<00:01:58.210> not<00:01:58.360> decided<00:01:58.660> yet<00:01:58.990> whether<00:01:59.140> we'll

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
I'm it's not decided yet whether we'll

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.670 
I'm it's not decided yet whether we'll
use<00:01:59.560> the<00:01:59.800> s30v<00:02:00.640> or<00:02:00.880> 154cm<00:02:01.509> awesome<00:02:02.320> they<00:02:02.470> even

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
use the s30v or 154cm awesome they even

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.609 
use the s30v or 154cm awesome they even
do<00:02:02.770> a<00:02:02.800> special<00:02:03.100> run<00:02:03.369> of<00:02:03.550> s35vn<00:02:04.360> or<00:02:04.780> or<00:02:05.140> d2<00:02:05.500> or

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
do a special run of s35vn or or d2 or

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.020 
do a special run of s35vn or or d2 or
something<00:02:05.860> like<00:02:05.920> that<00:02:06.130> but<00:02:06.580> we<00:02:06.729> have<00:02:06.880> the

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
something like that but we have the

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.730 
something like that but we have the
capability<00:02:07.630> of<00:02:07.720> that<00:02:07.780> with<00:02:08.080> these<00:02:08.259> because

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
capability of that with these because

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.490 
capability of that with these because
it's<00:02:09.520> an<00:02:09.640> injection<00:02:09.940> molded<00:02:10.450> handle<00:02:10.869> it's

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
it's an injection molded handle it's

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.800 
it's an injection molded handle it's
three<00:02:11.860> screws<00:02:12.220> to<00:02:12.430> put<00:02:12.459> it<00:02:12.610> together<00:02:12.819> yeah<00:02:13.420> the

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
three screws to put it together yeah the

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.210 
three screws to put it together yeah the
customer<00:02:14.170> can<00:02:14.200> still<00:02:14.470> take<00:02:14.650> it<00:02:14.770> apart<00:02:15.040> if

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
customer can still take it apart if

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.380 
customer can still take it apart if
something<00:02:15.459> happens<00:02:15.850> or

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
something happens or

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.210 
something happens or
spring<00:02:17.140> or<00:02:17.260> something<00:02:17.530> you<00:02:17.590> and<00:02:17.710> I<00:02:17.740> have<00:02:17.980> and

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
summertime but you could see production

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.890 
summertime but you could see production
on<00:02:33.430> these<00:02:33.670> and<00:02:33.970> several<00:02:34.300> different<00:02:34.600> colors

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900

Bible eight show okay almost our first
run<00:02:37.209> will<00:02:37.390> do<00:02:37.480> about<00:02:37.660> five<00:02:37.840> thousand<00:02:38.290> we'll

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
run will do about five thousand we'll

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.930 
run will do about five thousand we'll
see<00:02:38.530> how<00:02:38.590> they<00:02:38.740> sell<00:02:38.980> so<00:02:39.400> I<00:02:39.430> think<00:02:39.760> a<00:02:39.850> little

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
see how they sell so I think a little

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.030 
see how they sell so I think a little
more<00:02:40.420> higher<00:02:40.630> end<00:02:40.870> down<00:02:41.020> here<00:02:41.080> more<00:02:41.830> higher

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
more higher end down here more higher

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.979 
more higher end down here more higher
