00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
just following the same pattern of the S

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.430 
just following the same pattern of the S
as<00:02:22.980> we<00:02:23.160> made<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:24.390> I'm<00:02:24.540> also<00:02:24.720> doing<00:02:24.990> the<00:02:25.200> dots

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
as we made and I'm also doing the dots

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.250 
as we made and I'm also doing the dots
in<00:02:25.650> gold

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.899 

now<00:02:30.860> I'm<00:02:30.950> gonna<00:02:31.129> move<00:02:31.310> a<00:02:31.459> little<00:02:31.640> bit<00:02:31.849> higher

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:31.909 
now I'm gonna move a little bit higher

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:34.600 
now I'm gonna move a little bit higher
and<00:02:32.510> I'm<00:02:32.870> going<00:02:33.110> to<00:02:33.170> be<00:02:33.319> creating<00:02:33.590> another<00:02:34.280> s

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
and I'm going to be creating another s

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.589 
and I'm going to be creating another s
I'm<00:02:35.299> gonna<00:02:35.480> start<00:02:35.780> in<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:35.959> middle<00:02:36.379> and

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
I'm gonna start in the middle and

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.240 
I'm gonna start in the middle and
there's<00:02:38.599> one<00:02:39.049> of<00:02:39.080> my<00:02:39.349> assets<00:02:39.860> the<00:02:40.010> one<00:02:40.129> that

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
there's one of my assets the one that

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.920 
there's one of my assets the one that
goes<00:02:40.400> on<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:40.610> top<00:02:40.849> I'm<00:02:41.090> gonna<00:02:41.599> do<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:41.900> same

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
goes on the top I'm gonna do the same

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.130 
goes on the top I'm gonna do the same
exact<00:02:42.620> thing<00:02:42.849> run<00:02:43.849> another<00:02:44.180> s<00:02:44.450> coming<00:02:44.900> this

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
exact thing run another s coming this

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.740 
exact thing run another s coming this
way<00:02:45.379> close<00:02:46.099> it<00:02:46.340> off<00:02:46.489> until<00:02:47.030> I<00:02:47.060> can't<00:02:47.390> fit<00:02:47.599> it

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
way close it off until I can't fit it

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.720 
way close it off until I can't fit it
anymore<00:02:47.989> so<00:02:48.830> for<00:02:49.040> this<00:02:49.190> side<00:02:49.430> we're<00:02:49.580> also

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
anymore so for this side we're also

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.699 
anymore so for this side we're also
gonna<00:02:49.940> start<00:02:50.150> it<00:02:50.510> this<00:02:50.690> way<00:02:50.900> and<00:02:51.080> then<00:02:51.410> close

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
gonna start it this way and then close

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:52.570 
gonna start it this way and then close
it<00:02:51.920> off<00:02:52.010> like<00:02:52.280> that

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
it off like that

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.900 
it off like that
and<00:02:53.049> to<00:02:54.049> finish<00:02:54.290> off<00:02:54.590> this<00:02:55.160> design<00:02:55.580> I'm<00:02:55.760> just

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
and to finish off this design I'm just

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.490 
and to finish off this design I'm just
gonna<00:02:56.000> be<00:02:56.209> placing<00:02:56.860> one<00:02:58.090> two<00:02:59.090> dots<00:02:59.450> or<00:03:00.140> as<00:03:00.349> many

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
gonna be placing one two dots or as many

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.319 
gonna be placing one two dots or as many
as<00:03:00.650> you<00:03:00.799> can<00:03:00.980> fit<00:03:01.220> so<00:03:01.430> this<00:03:01.610> is<00:03:01.790> the<00:03:01.940> design

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
as you can fit so this is the design

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:05.199 
as you can fit so this is the design
that<00:03:02.870> I<00:03:02.930> used<00:03:03.260> for<00:03:03.500> for<00:03:04.310> these<00:03:04.489> nails<00:03:04.819> so

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
that I used for for these nails so

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:06.910 
that I used for for these nails so

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
nails are longer then that won't be a

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.740 
nails are longer then that won't be a
problem<00:04:29.310> but<00:04:29.760> another<00:04:30.030> thing<00:04:30.240> you<00:04:30.390> can<00:04:30.540> opt

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
problem but another thing you can opt

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.960 
problem but another thing you can opt
for<00:04:30.900> doing<00:04:31.290> is<00:04:31.410> also<00:04:31.800> dots<00:04:32.130> instead<00:04:32.520> of<00:04:32.820> the

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
for doing is also dots instead of the

for doing is also dots instead of the
little<00:04:33.180> leaf<00:04:33.450> like<00:04:33.690> shapes<00:04:34.050> so<00:04:34.590> I'm<00:04:34.680> making

going to move over and I'm just going to
continue<00:04:53.790> doing<00:04:53.940> that<00:04:54.240> all<00:04:54.480> the<00:04:54.780> way<00:04:54.900> around

I'm gonna go in and I'm just going to be

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.380 
I'm gonna go in and I'm just going to be
placing<00:05:22.220> a<00:05:22.400> little<00:05:22.820> dot

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.390 
placing a little dot

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.100 
placing a little dot
in<00:05:23.840> between<00:05:24.380> the<00:05:24.710> little<00:05:24.890> asses<00:05:25.690> just<00:05:26.690> a<00:05:26.840> tiny

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110
