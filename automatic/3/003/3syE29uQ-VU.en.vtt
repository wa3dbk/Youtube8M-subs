ionics<00:01:54.829> recent<00:01:55.829> leak<00:01:56.070> bug<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.939> they<00:01:57.119> used<00:01:57.360> in

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
ionics recent leak bug that they used in

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.209 
ionics recent leak bug that they used in
the<00:01:57.600> first<00:01:57.840> version<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:58.740> means<00:01:58.979> they

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
the first version so that means they

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.580 
the first version so that means they
remove<00:01:59.520> some<00:01:59.790> of<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.939> stuff<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:01.110> then<00:02:01.320> went

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.560 
remove some of the stuff and then went
ahead<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:02.040> used<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.579> different<00:02:02.969> exploit<00:02:03.329> and

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
ahead and used a different exploit and

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.170 
ahead and used a different exploit and
also<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.170> doesn't<00:02:04.320> add<00:02:04.590> any<00:02:04.890> extra<00:02:05.180> like

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
also it doesn't add any extra like

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.949

chinese<00:02:06.689> apps<00:02:07.680> or<00:02:08.099> anything<00:02:08.520> like<00:02:08.550> that<00:02:08.959> so

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
chinese apps or anything like that so

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.210
