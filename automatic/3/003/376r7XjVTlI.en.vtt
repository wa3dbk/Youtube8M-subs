00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:01.960
BOO

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:02.780
Hey!

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.540
It's me, Clara, I'm back again!

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.060
Here I am, with a pumpkin, one and a half week post-Halloween

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.480
And I know what you're thinking:

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.020
Clara? What are you doing? Pull yourself together? Get realistic?

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.880
But according to me, if you're taggad by the one and only MissLisibell

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.500
and didn't have the time to do The Lussetti Pumpkin Tag in the past two weeks

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.560
then it is okay to do the tag a while in arrears.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.180
And furthermore, we're like right between Halloween and Christmas

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.040
so I might as well do a Christmas pumpkin.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.060
Cheers!

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.640
The Lussetti Pumpkin Tag was created by Simon Lussetti's sister, Emma Lussetti.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.840
and is all about carving a pumpkin.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.300
And that's that.

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:53.318
LET'S KILL THIS B*TCH

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.140
This feels safe.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.540
Why am I moaning like this

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.200
I'm almost all the way around! IIIIH

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.993
JIPPIEEEEHOOOOO

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.100
Uuurrghhhhhh, nasty shiet

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.860
And the pumpkin is clean!

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.360
I'm keeping these pumpkin seeds, to... fry in the oven, or something.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.420
I'm not completely sure about how to do that, but...

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.480
... well. Google is my friend.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.560
Time to make this pumpkin Christmas-y!

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.080
So that we can celebrate Halloween in arrears and Christmas in advance.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.520
You can thank me later.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.200
Kids, if you're younger than 25 and don't have your parents' permission...

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.300
... don't do this at home.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.080
I don't have my parents' permission. But I'm a rebel.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.720
Dang, this is gonna look good! How long does a pumpkin stay fresh?

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.120
Do you think it's gonna last until Christmas, if I keep it?

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:08.120
WHO needs lanterns or Christmas stars, when you can have a pumpkin in your window?

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.580
Not me.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.820
This is how much I've done now.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.540
Ã–

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.580
I'm doing a Christmas tree... oh wow, I got pumpkin juice all over my face. 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.460
And if you don't celebrate Christmas, feel free to carve any tree of your desire.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.140
A birch, for example.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.020
That may be a bit harder, though, since birchs have a lot of branches.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.180
This is a really stereotype Christmas tree. There's no rule that says how a Christmas tree should look.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.700
If there's anything in this life that I'm afraid of, then that is this knife.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.940
It's so sharp that I actually could kill myself with it.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.040
There we go! Here's my pumpkin!

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.420
A Christmas tree!

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.890
And, to add the final touch...

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:17.260
... it's a gift from me... to you &lt;3333

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.800
Is this lit at all? I have no idea.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.440
Let's pull down the curtains.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.120
And my Christmas pumpkin is finitooooo

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.640
Do you want to make your own Christmas pumpkin?

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.620
Buy one!

00:03:34.682 --> 00:03:36.682
Before they... rot.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.600
I'm tagging BeasLiv and MileyCool551 (links below, Swedish speakers both of them)

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.720
Make your own Christmas pumpkins...

00:03:48.253 --> 00:03:50.253
... and let's celebrate Christmas a month early YAAAAZ

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.800
And if you're interested in buying this kind of beautiful stuff to drink coffee from,

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.880
then this print is available in five different colour on 100 different

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.140
well not 100, but a LOT of different stuff

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.048
at CLARAHENRY.SPREADSHIRT.SE

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.480
Links below.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.060
There are cups, t-shirts, hoodies, pins, bags,

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.220
... there are caps, and that is what there is.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.440
And I think that a lot of people would appreciate something like this as a Christmas gift...?

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.840
HINTHINT

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.480
Thank you for watching, I'll see you all next monday!

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.400
Ouch! ...what?!
