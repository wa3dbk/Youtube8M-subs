00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.280 
and on the back you get the security
lock<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.149> believe<00:02:03.479> there's<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.750> reset

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
lock and I believe there's a reset

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.999 
lock and I believe there's a reset
button<00:02:05.180> so<00:02:06.180> yeah<00:02:06.509> on<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.229> above<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:07.829> are

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
button so yeah on the above that are

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.669 
button so yeah on the above that are
just<00:02:08.220> like<00:02:08.429> I<00:02:08.459> guess<00:02:08.759> small<00:02:09.750> air<00:02:09.959> holes<00:02:10.200> or<00:02:10.500> air

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
just like I guess small air holes or air

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.620 
just like I guess small air holes or air
vents<00:02:11.039> so<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.730> air<00:02:11.849> can<00:02:12.000> come<00:02:12.150> out

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
vents so the air can come out

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.620 
vents so the air can come out
won't<00:02:12.810> overheat<00:02:13.530> oh<00:02:13.820> yeah<00:02:14.820> that's<00:02:15.060> about<00:02:15.150> it

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
won't overheat oh yeah that's about it

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.750 
won't overheat oh yeah that's about it
