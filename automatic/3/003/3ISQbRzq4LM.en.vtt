00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.010
 in 77 x 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:17.779
 but I have time I thought 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.850
 buy the listener and honda launched the pcx 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:24.480
 150 and I decided to buy a motorcycle vineyard 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.480
 to try it and here's the bike on 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.050
 truth is a listening 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:35.640
 There you will find the red beach on the 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.860
 At first I wanted white more then 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.980
 I got the red one, I said no. 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.210
 I regretted not listening red is 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.370
 very beautiful 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:50.519
 So I'll tell her a little bit about you. 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:54.180
 The pcx it came full of technology is not 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:56.850
 You must already be tired of knowing that 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.600
 the great attraction of her system start 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.150
 stop that wave of another name she I 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.850
 I'll show you later but the 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:12.330
 engine is very well finished she has 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.920
 11 no part fees have been made as 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.840
 You may realize you have no 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.370
 screw 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:25.910
 the beautiful fairing is all clean are one 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:30.660
 x perfect very succinct the screw 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:31.590
 pedal supports the leg it is of 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:36.650
 eraser 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:43.020
 is the aluminum rear pedal 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:46.140
 retractable is the little bitch it really is a lot 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.430
 cool, very cool to see the disc in 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.260
 forward 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:54.590
 it comes with two headlights or the lights 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:02:00.390
 of position 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:03.720
 the built-in turn signals also comes with 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.070
 bubble alone smoked very dark early 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.390
 I thought until she was not 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:12.420
 transparent but she is so that's it 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:16.500
 the automatic transmission 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.659
 cvt're the kind I'll put it here in 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.730
 center rest to get better 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:23.640
 dilma 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.129
 ready is there it rests is central 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.590
 Another advantage that besides not Stephano 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:32.099
 offers the option of lateral rest 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:35.489
 this person x she already comes with rest 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:38.489
 side and how can you rest me 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.920
 also makes it easier for some 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:44.549
 easy to clean situations 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:48.510
 So it's good to have this central rest. 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:50.579
 very easy to listen and light and 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.370
 a lever is big then you 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:59.879
 easily put she did not rest 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:02.220
 central has more to say 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:06.510
 sometimes I can be repetitive because 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:09.329
 she already has a time in the market still has 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.310
 A lot of people are wanting to buy me 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:13.410
 I took time to buy 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.440
 initially I stayed a maximum time 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.940
 Waiting just now began to appear 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.530
 concessionaires in some 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.190
 dealerships you already have some time 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:27.269
 who has the bike to speak and then my in 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:30.269
 67 x lately it has stayed like this 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:33.630
 leaned back but I did not leave 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:36.120
 I had not yet saved 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.940
 let's talk a little here so of the px 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.959
 panel for very beautiful 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:46.859
 I'll call you here to see 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:50.669
 beautiful blue illumination and the 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:54.709
 liquid crystal and amber yellow and she 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:57.630
 mark both the name having the total domain 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:00.510
 the partial odometer 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.889
 hence the total rodeo 172 kilometers I 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.160
 I think I'd better go back for a bit 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:07.109
 know more about the dispute and talk about it 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.239
 the fuel marker is much more 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:12.239
 I need them and she has nine 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:16.079
 bars on the fuel marker 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:19.590
 I think it's cool, she does a scan. 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:21.989
 the speedometer is that it shows that the 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.099
 speedometer is fully electronic not 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.840
 has cable 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:30.480
 Look at this is the light indication of the 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:35.580
 start stop system o 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:40.440
 is connected to if I click the button here 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:43.920
 to turn off the lusinha paid here looks the 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.620
 button and the light better right 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.570
 I particularly prefer it always 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.820
 connected left disconnected there are no people 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:54.330
 What do you think it's better to go with him? 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:56.700
 I cool it off alone will 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.280
 to say something very very nice she 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:03.950
 very chromed here on the table the cables 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:08.370
 all built-in different from motorbikes is 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:09.570
 cool zinha even looks only 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.750
 it's nice 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:17.040
 in front of her I changed her so that 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:19.860
 come on i will have a led bulb leave 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:24.120
 the most attractive look 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:27.870
 I think it was good with her lets 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.190
 show that perhaps the 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:36.120
 door objects 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:40.350
 here is a cell phone wallet is 11 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:45.270
 glove, something small I think 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:47.400
 It should come with with 11 keys but 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.770
 unfortunately it does not have a key so always 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:53.100
 When they have stopped, they can leave things behind. 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:56.730
 they kept it is not right here come the 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:59.580
 information on tire size 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:03.930
 calibration for pilot pilots and 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:08.820
 croup has information here that is 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:10.920
 interesting to read before using motorbike and 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:14.360
 every week to calibrate the tire 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:19.380
 things are good always keep order 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:22.350
 You are here or can turn off key has 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:24.900
 a position that allows us to have 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:26.910
 access to the fuel tank it says 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:30.780
 locked is not access the camera 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:36.230
 competitive here button tightening on the 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:38.740
 panel and up the bank and if people 

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:42.819
 down 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:44.860
 she opens the bank 

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:46.240
 We have access to door objects and 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.810
 I think objects by size 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.970
 very cool for the helmet 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:54.699
 quietly and there is still room for 

00:06:51.970 --> 00:07:01.479
 carry a lot of stuff there, a backpack 

00:06:54.699 --> 00:07:02.620
 a tablet a rain cover only on the cable and 

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:05.229
 two helmets 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:08.889
 but if the helmet off with what I 

00:07:05.229 --> 00:07:13.169
 I said you can see that the fittings in the 

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:13.169
 fairing made me a long time ago 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:19.090
 the very good finish a good culture 

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:22.990
 very cool also very good do not have 

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:25.840
 much the word even when the object 

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:33.280
 many screws appear 

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:35.979
 I found really cool is essentially going 

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.960
 speak only a little about it and 

00:07:35.979 --> 00:07:40.120
 then the post a video talking more 

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:43.509
 about what I found of performance 

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:45.849
 her walking comfort and nothing else 

00:07:43.509 --> 00:07:49.889
 Okay, okay. For now I'll stick around. 

00:07:45.849 --> 00:07:49.889
 a hug for you to go to the next
