the season but did he get some runs and
it<00:00:44.710> loosens<00:00:44.860> everything<00:00:45.340> pitching<00:00:45.760> well<00:00:45.910> out

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
it loosens everything pitching well out

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.639 
it loosens everything pitching well out
there<00:00:46.059> for<00:00:46.360> the<00:00:46.420> most<00:00:46.600> part<00:00:46.750> you<00:00:46.930> know<00:00:47.020> ash<00:00:47.469> I

there for the most part you know ash I

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:49.740 
there for the most part you know ash I
didn't<00:00:47.800> feel<00:00:47.920> great<00:00:48.190> out<00:00:48.340> there<00:00:48.370> my<00:00:49.300> control

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
didn't feel great out there my control

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.979 
didn't feel great out there my control
wasn't<00:00:50.140> when<00:00:50.680> normally<00:00:51.190> as<00:00:51.309> at<00:00:51.489> least<00:00:51.870> also<00:00:52.870> my

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
wasn't when normally as at least also my

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:55.200 
wasn't when normally as at least also my
curve<00:00:53.260> didn't<00:00:53.649> feel<00:00:53.770> great<00:00:54.039> but<00:00:54.280> I<00:00:54.550> was

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
curve didn't feel great but I was

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.930 
curve didn't feel great but I was
throwing<00:00:55.420> strike<00:00:55.719> two<00:00:55.870> times<00:00:56.140> I<00:00:56.559> and<00:00:57.460> then<00:00:57.579> our

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
throwing strike two times I and then our

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.069 
throwing strike two times I and then our
fielder's<00:00:58.270> played<00:00:58.480> great<00:00:58.660> if<00:00:58.809> I<00:00:58.930> don't

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
fielder's played great if I don't

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:00.810 
fielder's played great if I don't
believe<00:00:59.260> that<00:00:59.590> was<00:01:00.129> the<00:01:00.160> key<00:01:00.340> I<00:01:00.370> thought<00:01:00.640> I

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
believe that was the key I thought I

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.250 
believe that was the key I thought I
just<00:01:01.030> want<00:01:01.149> to<00:01:01.180> hit<00:01:01.270> the<00:01:01.390> ball<00:01:01.539> I<00:01:01.600> really<00:01:02.109> had

just want to hit the ball I really had

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.139
