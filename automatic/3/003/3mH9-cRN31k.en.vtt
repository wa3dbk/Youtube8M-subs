00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.929

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.610
 go for another goal in 90 and today I go 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.839
 show you my pics and also 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.960
 a lot of people understand that it 's easier 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.970
 you tap last video knew about 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.619
 My childbirth I know my room and not 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.960
 understood how it is possible for some 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.269
 70 so i decided maceiÃ³ 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.609
 his settings and how it works 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.769
 everything that sets right before I 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.260
 I wanted to say that this computer is not 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.690
 Sponsored I bought because I was 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.890
 missing a computer and I 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.160
 I do not know if she had to ask for a 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.370
 partnership I arrived with tata to contact you 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.160
 partnership in the dust then I 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.190
 I had to buy even then he is mine. 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.110
 do not have credit for anyone you can 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.110
 think of it, you already made a video 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.180
 talking about ketam I made in portugal 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.190
 you were also there that was an asset 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.430
 that the notebook that was the case 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.080
 so who would paste a notebook here when 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.610
 I got the computer here that I did not have 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.740
 nothing special 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.970
 nothing even he was a gift from 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.010
 2013 birthday but 2013 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.960
 really did not understand what i 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.670
 needed a tie including bigger 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.530
 part was tending I already had 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.750
 bought a video card to win 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.250
 he improved and yet he was not 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.920
 having world he starts to work 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.530
 too and I thought oh yes no I did not 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.579
 I can do without video does not 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.740
 so I bought this so I go 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.390
 show that now for you I hope 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.970
 that you like but before I go 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.880
 start showing an industry page 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.310
 what a joke is cooking games 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.159
 because to understand that he used the same 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:52.350
 simpler office chair only 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:54.840
 that she falls one arm then the other 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.799
 and then leave 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.460
 as it was very weak very very fragile 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:04.140
 short 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.220
 broke his leg with a night like the 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.440
 beautiful city 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:12.660
 then all free while until a new 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.060
 so now how do I go? 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.950
 hit first have the office 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.280

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:33.090
 mark the rock and it's a b 7 5 megl 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.310

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.120
 more inputs than dsde inputs and cds 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.510

 days to complement the processor is 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.550
 an intel and 7 and the video card one gtx 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:53.550
 760 to handle all this has a 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.620
 uninterruptible power supply of pc thousand mark 200 volts 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.959
 it for me the computer to suffer some 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.840
 damage if power fails or lightning strikes 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:04.680
 or something like that my monitor 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:08.299
 philips monitor the only one I use 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:12.989
 how did hot is a webcam from logitech 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:15.989
 c270 my keyboard he's gay me is 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:18.060
 mechanic and to mark the zone 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:22.200
 he is from a series called strike and he 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:24.120
 is the strike pro the mouse 1 cm storm is the 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.150
 set of respect of codemasters comes 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.040
 the mouse and the entire keyboard not only the mouse 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.640
 mouse it changes the speed you 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.829
 want to fiddle with a pointer on the computer 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.049
 Finally the headset for more than is 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:39.900
 everything is broken it's a 500 series of 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:41.670
 codemat it is game and also it is of the series c 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.350
 and makes me particularly like 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.180
 So much of it so if you ask 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.310
 me the headset I recommend I recommend 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.290
 But, but I hope you sold them. 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.660
 I was being right explained everything 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.970
 but that does not let anything happen 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.459
 after I got my camera that 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.519
 I think the movie is now the mother who does not 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.720
 leave the center then if you want 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.660
 a recommendation of 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.270
 I recommend this or earlier she had 600 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:11.610
 b essences with water or series 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:13.830
 ramÃ³n that is t13 t and looks is something more 65 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.049
 it's something if not all of you 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.630
 wanted camera recommendation, I 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.489

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.269
 I said everything I hope you have 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.770
