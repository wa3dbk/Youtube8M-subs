made a different way this is something
you<00:01:23.580> can<00:01:23.790> mix<00:01:24.000> with<00:01:24.090> protein<00:01:24.600> powder<00:01:24.810> use<00:01:25.350> with

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
you can mix with protein powder use with

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.530 
you can mix with protein powder use with
cereal<00:01:25.950> or<00:01:26.220> using<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:26.939> same<00:01:27.150> way<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.420> you
