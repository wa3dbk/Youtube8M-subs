that's<00:02:11.930> crazy<00:02:12.200> got<00:02:12.950> a<00:02:12.980> lot<00:02:13.160> of<00:02:13.190> launch<00:02:15.010> yeah

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
that's crazy got a lot of launch yeah

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.190 
that's crazy got a lot of launch yeah
it's<00:02:16.190> got<00:02:16.370> a<00:02:16.430> tile<00:02:16.700> launch<00:02:19.390> you<00:02:20.390> went<00:02:20.540> 10<00:02:20.720> 38<00:02:21.080> I

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
it's got a tile launch you went 10 38 I

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.420 
it's got a tile launch you went 10 38 I
go<00:02:21.440> 1026<00:02:23.050> that's<00:02:24.050> not<00:02:24.230> bad<00:02:24.410> though<00:02:24.590> that's

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
go 1026 that's not bad though that's

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:33.850 
go 1026 that's not bad though that's
close<00:02:25.610> that's<00:02:25.910> like<00:02:26.060> pretty<00:02:26.420> evenly<00:02:26.750> matched

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.680 

I<00:02:33.950> think<00:02:34.160> better<00:02:34.490> tires<00:02:34.850> may<00:02:35.270> make<00:02:35.540> the

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
I think better tires may make the

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.530 
I think better tires may make the
difference<00:02:35.720> in<00:02:36.170> this<00:02:36.260> case

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.570
