 you decide to take a video to be less 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.839
 less visible and immediately cute although i'm at 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.670
 In principle, all the classes have been cut through, but here 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.449
 can this tourist 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.869
 indicator 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.730
 ha mean, let's go up on the grid 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:28.289
 the tool was originally chisel 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.330
 Therefore, the guardian of the laptop itself is further such 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.800
 rubber pad and just squandered 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.420
 hand and will also describe him for 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:39.750
 cut into the hands of the air still on the region 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.140
 pen knob covers like with earphones 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.260
 make it easier on and grumble her cutter 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:49.020
 to the world side that knee wasted 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.890
 what was only niche and softer then report 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:56.370
 glad to cross like a hand and get blades 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:00.180
 a detachment from his penis buttered tea pit 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.480
 But even the most oil to grow so let's say 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.430
 cutter let's try to show 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:11.400
 whether my equipment just try 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:15.860
 put on the channel as we proceed to 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.969
 matches butter not 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:25.729
 here is the price 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:25.729
 demand to go let the beluga and 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:39.280
 this can be just as silent and I know that 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:41.950
 our azure we can oil better 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.649
 The nuance of the trend is in order here itself 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:48.100
 implementation nazar if something I'm cutting 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:49.950
 completely foresee mathematics by 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.659
 order 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:02:00.100
 survived all this meat and I cut 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:02.170
 cut let's say you're still a sidewall here 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.509
 also on the side everything is ready tons when 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:09.850

 the cleaners cut themselves 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.210
 basically 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.210
 want 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.549
 and 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.870
 then you say about the field, I tried bits 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.900
 hammer on chisel 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.450
 so rude to them it turns out better 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.390
 to know that the lowest of the rice is already curves such 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.519
 naive up down there everything is scotch here 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:05.230
 in this way we can already see 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:07.640
 it turns out clearly shows that requires Rafi 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.860
 adjust but because you know yourself 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.140
 call him like that he was kind 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.530
 drooped and people still peacefully army 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:23.299
 started oil again and again everything turns out 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:27.230
 lower class here such for from obviously too 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:30.440

 where Wednesday and for there times and assigned 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:10.069
 persist and then I see this principle 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:12.669
 Metabo bhe there is already all your 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:16.239

 and significant miracles reaching before cutting 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:10.350
 fills it was still more expensive than pull 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.180
 and so saunas producing then after a couple 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.630
 options for there he went
