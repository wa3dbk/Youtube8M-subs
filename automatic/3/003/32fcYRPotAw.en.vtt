00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
to blend it out go in a little bit into

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.230

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.410 
bottom here and apply some of that
powder<00:02:17.140> depending<00:02:18.140> you<00:02:18.590> know<00:02:18.710> what<00:02:19.640> exactly

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
powder depending you know what exactly

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
what effect you want to thin or not that

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.370 
what effect you want to thin or not that
thin<00:02:23.030> that's<00:02:23.390> how<00:02:23.630> much<00:02:23.810> color<00:02:24.080> you're<00:02:24.230> going

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
thin that's how much color you're going

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.080

to<00:02:24.620> apply<00:02:24.830> but<00:02:25.400> then<00:02:25.490> again<00:02:25.730> you<00:02:25.880> don't<00:02:25.970> want

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
to apply but then again you don't want

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.090 
to apply but then again you don't want
to<00:02:26.240> make<00:02:26.390> it<00:02:26.540> too<00:02:26.810> obvious<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:27.590> point<00:02:27.860> is<00:02:27.950> to

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
to make it too obvious the point is to

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.730 
to make it too obvious the point is to
trick<00:02:28.340> people<00:02:28.700> into<00:02:29.570> believing<00:02:29.900> that<00:02:30.200> your
