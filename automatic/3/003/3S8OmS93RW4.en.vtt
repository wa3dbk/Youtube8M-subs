any kind of editorial control and in my

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.010 
any kind of editorial control and in my
experience<00:04:42.910> of<00:04:43.030> not<00:04:43.300> being<00:04:43.479> independent

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
experience of not being independent

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.670 
experience of not being independent
which<00:04:44.229> I<00:04:44.410> have<00:04:44.590> done<00:04:44.770> briefly<00:04:46.320> it's<00:04:47.320> actually

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
which I have done briefly it's actually

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.409 
which I have done briefly it's actually
it<00:04:47.800> is<00:04:47.979> literally<00:04:48.389> psychologically<00:04:49.389> not

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
it is literally psychologically not

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:51.480 
it is literally psychologically not
possible<00:04:50.139> to<00:04:50.380> be<00:04:50.500> independent<00:04:51.070> under

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
possible to be independent under

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.310 
possible to be independent under
corporate<00:04:51.729> conditions<00:04:52.300> if<00:04:52.570> you<00:04:52.780> get<00:04:53.050> paid

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
corporate conditions if you get paid

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.290 
corporate conditions if you get paid
it's<00:04:53.620> not<00:04:53.770> possible<00:04:54.190> and<00:04:54.370> so<00:04:55.000> it's<00:04:55.120> absolutely

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
it's not possible and so it's absolutely

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.330 
it's not possible and so it's absolutely
important<00:04:56.110> to<00:04:56.169> me<00:04:56.320> to<00:04:56.500> be<00:04:56.530> independent<00:04:57.220> and

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
important to me to be independent and

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.830 
important to me to be independent and
actually<00:04:57.699> this<00:04:57.820> is<00:04:57.880> one<00:04:58.120> of<00:04:58.240> the<00:04:58.360> the<00:04:58.630> things

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
actually this is one of the the things

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.960 
actually this is one of the the things
which<00:04:58.990> facilitates<00:04:59.620> my<00:04:59.800> work<00:05:00.010> is<00:05:00.580> that<00:05:00.849> I'm

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 
that way so it was dangerous it was the

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.760 
that way so it was dangerous it was the

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 
whether or not they're able to

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.300 
whether or not they're able to
psychologically<00:06:16.840> deal<00:06:17.050> with<00:06:17.349> that<00:06:17.590> trust<00:06:18.070> me

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310
