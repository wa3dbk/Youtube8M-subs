00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
just kept taking it for a while and then

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.450 
just kept taking it for a while and then
once<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.140> saw<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.380> wasn't<00:01:52.770> really<00:01:53.100> having<00:01:53.280> any

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
folds in my arms some time not too much

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.140 
folds in my arms some time not too much

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
but sometimes in the backs money pretty

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.910 
but sometimes in the backs money pretty
much<00:02:55.330> wherever<00:02:55.540> those<00:02:55.810> decrease<00:02:56.260> and<00:02:56.590> on

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
much wherever those decrease and on

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.540 
much wherever those decrease and on
there<00:02:57.850> could<00:02:58.750> possibly<00:02:59.230> like<00:02:59.800> course<00:03:00.190> what

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
there could possibly like course what

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.040 
there could possibly like course what
would<00:03:00.670> be<00:03:00.850> where<00:03:01.090> you'd<00:03:01.240> sweat<00:03:01.630> where<00:03:01.870> there's

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
would be where you'd sweat where there's

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.250 
would be where you'd sweat where there's
a<00:03:02.140> crease<00:03:02.470> that's<00:03:03.190> where<00:03:03.430> I<00:03:03.460> would<00:03:03.910> um<00:03:04.260> mostly

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
a crease that's where I would um mostly

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.810 
a crease that's where I would um mostly
get<00:03:05.560> my<00:03:05.740> outbreak<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:07.450> um<00:03:07.900> so<00:03:08.530> I<00:03:08.920> just<00:03:09.490> I

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
started seeing result of up to two to

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.120 
started seeing result of up to two to
three<00:03:12.430> weeks<00:03:12.490> after<00:03:12.880> dig<00:03:13.210> net<00:03:13.420> and<00:03:13.739> I<00:03:14.739> just

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
kept taking it just I probably took it

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.760 
kept taking it just I probably took it

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
because I got in the habit of taking it

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.490 
because I got in the habit of taking it
as<00:03:24.310> a<00:03:24.340> routine<00:03:24.700> and<00:03:25.110> eventually<00:03:26.110> just<00:03:26.260> died
