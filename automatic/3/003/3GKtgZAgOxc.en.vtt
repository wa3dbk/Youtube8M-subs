00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.410 
probably go check it because my house
could<00:03:36.480> be<00:03:36.570> burning<00:03:36.900> down<00:03:37.079> or<00:03:37.670> maybe<00:03:38.670> I<00:03:38.760> put<00:03:39.299> my

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
could be burning down or maybe I put my

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.300 
could be burning down or maybe I put my
combustible<00:03:39.959> lemons<00:03:40.260> too<00:03:40.560> close<00:03:40.769> to<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.070> oven

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
combustible lemons too close to the oven

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.849 
combustible lemons too close to the oven
and<00:03:41.519> so<00:03:42.120> life<00:03:42.690> is<00:03:42.900> going<00:03:43.079> to<00:03:43.170> burn<00:03:43.380> my<00:03:43.650> house

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
and so life is going to burn my house

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.880 
and so life is going to burn my house
down<00:03:43.890> with<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:44.489> lemons<00:03:44.840> anyways<00:03:45.859> you<00:03:46.859> should

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890
