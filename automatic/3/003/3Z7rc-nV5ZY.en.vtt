00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.070
 little video but really very very 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.870

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:24.210
 it's just to show you my 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.820
 first intec crowd pig and especially 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.730
 the attacked he spawned an attack 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.170
 at I had a lot of goals 1 so by 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.489
 against just now I was trying 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.190
 to record his us blind and 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.190
 completely so I said I need 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.210
 that you obey the pink rock loan 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.550
 Celtic who said hello 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.300
 so I make you a little dedication I 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:52.739
 also make a dedication to all 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:54.840
 subscribers and then also to stanislas jamie 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:59.340
 and Julian c friends who support me 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.559
 in my videos and so it's the small 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.789
 attack that I did it's not the 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.600
 little striker it was a big 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.280
 attack that I did was so it was 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.619
 the level 9 town hall it's really 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.540
 very very big level with a super 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.130
 village but really very very good 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.030
 town 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.640
 that is, there were towers of 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.580
 wizard level 5 and 4 but against a 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.189
 big fat inactive so these mines were 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.060
 completely full of stroke I got 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.590
 created a good booty the jacques so there 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.360
 I attracted the king of the barbarians and I 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.939
 went to City Hall with his 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.000
 and then send him from dragon to kill the 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.530
 king of the barbarians so janraie all 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.420
 the giants next to the anti is reindeer 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.030
 with a stormy night and bim more 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.130
 anti-aircraft and direct sending the 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.049
 healer up in addition to the healer 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.149
 with a stormy evening it does not heal thoroughly 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.950
 it's incredible brief 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.270
 so here's where I sent spell of 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.470
 care about their age because I wanted 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.649
 sent everything in one go to make 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.649
 incredible damage and well it worked 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.190
 so you see that there really needs to be 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.599
 when one attacks one must as one says 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.250
 the union is strength is someone 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.780
 who told me in a clan is 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.040
 actually the union is strength 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.780
 that's why we have to send his 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.849
 troops as much as possible at the same time 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.260
 never sent for example that these giants 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.540
 wait for it to do a lot of damage 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.420
 is then sent the rest it takes everything 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.540
 sent at the same time you have to have a 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.000
 good timing and that's really what makes 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.500
 the difference and I advise you this 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.080
 that I did not do unfortunately 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.459
 keep some archers for 6 or 7 48% 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.790
 to fetch a percentage 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.940
 for free because if I had 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.880
 kept two kinds and win but hey 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.170
 it is not very serious 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:51.780
 finally I would have won 2 stars yes I 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:53.820
 am already 45% up 46% 48% and here it is 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.739
 all the rest of my troops are going to get 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.019
 to explode 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:00.120
 unfortunately it's not very good 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.549
 I had a great scorer 200000 almost 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.049
 of each and then 700 and 800 black it's 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.910
 especially that interested me since I 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.549
 tell him well let's make an attack 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.859
 fall researcher during a small 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:15.420
 little pleasure I would have seen what happened 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:16.680
 gone ok well so now I 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.060
 will show you my attack for this 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.769
 hardworking and I explain to you how the 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.680
 then make an insane attack on 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:24.510
 rider first of all the first 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.620
 to do is to see if there are any 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.910
 troubles a cat all clan in 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.319
 the occurrence there the guy he did not care 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.400
 totally from his castle of clans and he 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.819
 there was no troop in it so 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.819
 fell well 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.370
 then send you some archers 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.709
 to have blackjack percentages 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.370
 since the clan castle there is nothing 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:45.620
 in then you 'll have two three 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.620
 researchers to see if there are any pitfalls 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.989
 hello big strategic so here we can 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.610
 see that I have not found any traps and 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.739
 Thursday we will send everything there so the 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.379
 rochard games you have to send everything everything 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:02.349
 all too soon send everything to the 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:03.879
 less right so since they are together 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:07.720
 they will if they will gather on 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:11.920
 the defenses and and you'll see that 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.750
 it's a carnage and there you 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.150
 see all these shoes that they are there 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:20.169
 to resume 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:21.400
 So suddenly it's great so there I see 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.050
 that they start to really drop to 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.410
 to be in the red so I cast a spell 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.360
 of care and 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.920
 and lower healing spell heal and Valais 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.260
 since they are all in the same place it 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:34.280
 is going to be super efficient and it's really 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:39.630
 the basis of the trick 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:44.820
 so here I am with a care spell of the 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:46.050
 blow I will use and then way I 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.120
 did not need others since there 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.610
 you can see that I'm looking in 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.610
 train to really do the carnage they 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:56.640
 have shaved the whole base there's no more 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:05:00.660
 defense is there so they're just going 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:04.100
 to have fun so I offer you 2 and 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.100
 they will take the league this is a black 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.670
 so really researchers this is a 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.870
 very good troops but the thing that 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.760
 I do not like it is that it is done in 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.800
 Neglecting black and when we are hotel 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.380
 2007 the black elixir is not at all 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.640
 that we have en masse and that's why I 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.670
 will soon be passing city hall 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:25.380
 level fast because I'm starting to be 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:27.120
 in need of and elixir me we will say the 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.490
 big game will be local level 8 this is 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.590
 much simpler to get and that 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.210
 is going to be super cool so you see 38 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.650
 riding a dozen archers I 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.410
 not have all used and then as 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.390
 healing spells that's not it was a very 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.500
 very short video 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.790
 I hope you have enjoyed it in everything 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:46.200
 If I have been very happy with you 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:48.680
 present it to everyone was their 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.680
 of Aix-les-Bains
