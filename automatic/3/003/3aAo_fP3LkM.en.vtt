00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.730 

destruction<00:01:25.530> over<00:01:25.619> there<00:01:25.830> on<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:25.950> side<00:01:27.740> on

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
destruction over there on the side on

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.499 
destruction over there on the side on
equality<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.310> gonna<00:01:29.430> be<00:01:29.520> very<00:01:29.729> good<00:01:29.970> on<00:01:30.000> this<00:01:30.299> I

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.100 
definitely have to say as far as the
video<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:32.790> concerned<00:01:32.970> there's<00:01:33.570> something<00:01:33.840> if

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
video is concerned there's something if

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.050 
video is concerned there's something if
he<00:01:34.140> doesn't<00:01:34.650> stepped<00:01:34.860> up<00:01:35.040> on<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.820> video

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060

he doesn't stepped up on the video
quality<00:01:36.299> seems<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:37.049> be<00:01:37.229> blocking<00:01:37.890> side<00:01:38.280> there

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
quality seems to be blocking side there

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.609 
quality seems to be blocking side there
a<00:01:38.520> little<00:01:38.729> bit<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.390> that's<00:01:39.960> an<00:01:40.500> a

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
a little bit and that's an a

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.789 
a little bit and that's an a
