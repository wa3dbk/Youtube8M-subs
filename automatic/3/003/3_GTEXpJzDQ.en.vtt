minecraft<00:00:23.130> let's<00:00:23.430> play<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:24.240> showcase<00:00:24.750> type

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
minecraft let's play a showcase type

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.410 
minecraft let's play a showcase type
thing<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.380> he<00:00:25.859> incorporated<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.670> light<00:00:27.180> switch

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
thing and he incorporated a light switch

wheat<00:00:27.750> farm<00:00:28.080> in<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.710> basically<00:00:29.189> how<00:00:29.519> it

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
wheat farm in it and basically how it

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.700 
wheat farm in it and basically how it
works<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:30.090> you<00:00:30.449> flip<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.840> lever<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.439> then

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
works is you flip the lever and then

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.370 
works is you flip the lever and then
these<00:00:32.130> lights<00:00:32.460> will<00:00:32.610> turn<00:00:32.730> off<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.480> all<00:00:34.140> the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
these lights will turn off and all the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.560 
these lights will turn off and all the
wheat<00:00:34.800> will<00:00:34.980> get<00:00:35.100> harvested<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.300> I'll<00:00:36.420> go

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
wheat will get harvested and I'll go

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.940 
wheat will get harvested and I'll go
into<00:00:37.219> how<00:00:38.219> this<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.640> how<00:00:39.270> this<00:00:39.510> happens<00:00:39.950> but

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
into how this is how this happens but

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.910 
into how this is how this happens but
the<00:00:41.280> difference<00:00:41.399> is<00:00:41.760> in<00:00:42.090> his<00:00:42.469> let's<00:00:43.469> play<00:00:43.710> or

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
the difference is in his let's play or

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.360 
the difference is in his let's play or
in<00:00:44.070> his<00:00:44.219> design<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:45.420> have<00:00:45.800> these<00:00:46.800> redstone

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
in his design you have these redstone

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.520 
in his design you have these redstone
lamps<00:00:47.700> all<00:00:47.850> across<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.629> ceiling<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.320> it's

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
lamps all across the ceiling and it's

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.389 
lamps all across the ceiling and it's
very<00:00:50.149> not<00:00:51.149> resource<00:00:51.719> friendly<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:52.800> took<00:00:53.070> the

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
very not resource friendly so I took the

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.540 
very not resource friendly so I took the
time<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:54.110> make<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.140> design<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.739> resource

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
time to make a design that is resource

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.250 
time to make a design that is resource
friendly<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.600> will<00:00:57.780> allow<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:59.120> use

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
friendly that will allow you to use

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.549 
friendly that will allow you to use
minimal<00:01:01.260> resources<00:01:02.300> so<00:01:03.300> yeah<00:01:03.480> again<00:01:04.199> i'm<00:01:04.530> not

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
minimal resources so yeah again i'm not

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.770 
minimal resources so yeah again i'm not
sure<00:01:05.129> if<00:01:05.369> he<00:01:05.580> was<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.970> original<00:01:06.060> creator<00:01:06.720> of

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
sure if he was the original creator of

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.990 
sure if he was the original creator of
the<00:01:07.080> design<00:01:07.729> so<00:01:08.729> yeah<00:01:09.479> um<00:01:09.890> so<00:01:10.890> ok<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:11.610> we're<00:01:11.970> in

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
the design so yeah um so ok so we're in

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.609 
the design so yeah um so ok so we're in
our<00:01:12.240> room<00:01:12.270> right<00:01:12.630> here<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:13.049> we<00:01:13.290> have<00:01:13.320> our

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
weight all around us just flip the lever

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.380 
weight all around us just flip the lever
Kolgrim<00:01:16.950> becomes<00:01:17.250> dark<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:18.060> can<00:01:18.210> see

Kolgrim becomes dark and you can see

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.770 
Kolgrim becomes dark and you can see
everything<00:01:19.080> just<00:01:19.200> got<00:01:19.380> harvested<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.820> of

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
course i'm lagging really bad so i'll

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.200 
course i'm lagging really bad so i'll
let<00:01:24.420> me<00:01:24.509> turn<00:01:24.990> back<00:01:25.229> on<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.560> lights

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
let me turn back on the lights

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.500 
let me turn back on the lights
and<00:01:27.100> then<00:01:28.100> the<00:01:28.310> doors<00:01:28.520> open<00:01:28.909> and<00:01:29.090> then<00:01:29.330> as<00:01:29.479> long

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
and then the doors open and then as long

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.690 
and then the doors open and then as long
as<00:01:29.840> you<00:01:29.960> don't<00:01:30.229> jump<00:01:30.619> you<00:01:30.920> can<00:01:31.100> actually<00:01:31.430> pick

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
as you don't jump you can actually pick

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.840 
as you don't jump you can actually pick
all<00:01:31.940> the<00:01:32.119> seeds<00:01:32.420> up<00:01:32.630> right<00:01:32.869> here<00:01:33.550> so<00:01:34.550> you<00:01:34.640> can

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
all the seeds up right here so you can

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.880 
all the seeds up right here so you can
just<00:01:34.880> walk<00:01:35.270> you'll<00:01:35.630> quick<00:01:35.900> walkthrough<00:01:36.409> and

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
just walk you'll quick walkthrough and

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.580 
just walk you'll quick walkthrough and
then<00:01:37.070> hopefully<00:01:37.460> my<00:01:38.420> game<00:01:38.690> will<00:01:38.869> stop<00:01:39.110> lagging

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
then hopefully my game will stop lagging

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.719 
then hopefully my game will stop lagging
once<00:01:40.400> I<00:01:40.700> pick<00:01:41.540> up<00:01:41.720> the<00:01:41.869> majority<00:01:42.020> of<00:01:42.409> these<00:01:42.729> so

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
once I pick up the majority of these so

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.570 
once I pick up the majority of these so
just<00:01:43.940> walk<00:01:44.119> through<00:01:44.180> and<00:01:44.780> pick<00:01:45.050> up<00:01:45.580> seeds

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
just walk through and pick up seeds

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.820 
just walk through and pick up seeds
along<00:01:46.820> here<00:01:47.300> and<00:01:47.840> what's<00:01:48.200> nice<00:01:48.350> about<00:01:48.409> this

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
along here and what's nice about this

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.740 
along here and what's nice about this
design<00:01:49.190> though<00:01:49.460> is<00:01:49.729> while<00:01:50.030> you're<00:01:50.240> walking<00:01:50.450> to

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
design though is while you're walking to

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.510 
design though is while you're walking to
pick<00:01:50.899> up<00:01:51.020> seeds<00:01:51.290> you<00:01:51.440> can<00:01:51.470> actually<00:01:51.770> replant

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
pick up seeds you can actually replant

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.680 
pick up seeds you can actually replant
them<00:01:52.640> at<00:01:52.790> the<00:01:52.940> same<00:01:53.119> time<00:01:53.390> so<00:01:54.310> yeah<00:01:55.310> so<00:01:56.240> I<00:01:56.270> hold

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
them at the same time so yeah so I hold

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.480 
them at the same time so yeah so I hold
on<00:01:56.810> I'm<00:01:57.140> just<00:01:57.290> gonna<00:01:57.440> put<00:01:57.860> some<00:01:58.040> of<00:01:58.159> the<00:01:58.220> stuff

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
on I'm just gonna put some of the stuff

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.749 
on I'm just gonna put some of the stuff
away<00:01:58.640> you<00:01:58.820> get<00:01:59.119> a<00:01:59.179> lot<00:01:59.479> of<00:02:00.100> seeds<00:02:01.100> and<00:02:01.460> wheat

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
away you get a lot of seeds and wheat

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.020 
away you get a lot of seeds and wheat
from<00:02:02.270> this<00:02:02.509> so<00:02:03.350> like<00:02:04.190> I<00:02:04.310> said<00:02:04.369> you<00:02:04.670> can<00:02:04.700> just

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
from this so like I said you can just

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.169 
from this so like I said you can just
walk<00:02:05.330> long<00:02:06.110> and<00:02:06.350> then<00:02:06.500> plant<00:02:06.860> more<00:02:07.610> seeds<00:02:07.820> as

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
walk long and then plant more seeds as

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.530 
walk long and then plant more seeds as
you<00:02:08.360> pick<00:02:08.570> up<00:02:08.690> more<00:02:08.989> items<00:02:09.380> and<00:02:10.000> to<00:02:11.000> be<00:02:11.120> honest

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
you pick up more items and to be honest

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.199 
you pick up more items and to be honest
there's<00:02:12.470> really<00:02:12.680> no<00:02:13.010> point<00:02:13.310> of<00:02:13.760> a<00:02:13.970> water

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
there's really no point of a water

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.229 
there's really no point of a water
stream<00:02:14.540> to<00:02:14.780> come<00:02:15.620> and<00:02:15.800> carry<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:16.640> items<00:02:16.970> and

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
stream to come and carry the items and

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.040 
stream to come and carry the items and
the<00:02:17.780> harvest<00:02:18.140> wheat<00:02:18.350> to<00:02:18.800> you<00:02:18.980> automatically

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
the harvest wheat to you automatically

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.330 
the harvest wheat to you automatically
because<00:02:21.050> I<00:02:21.080> mean<00:02:21.470> you're<00:02:21.620> gonna<00:02:21.709> have<00:02:21.950> to<00:02:22.100> walk

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
because I mean you're gonna have to walk

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.520 
because I mean you're gonna have to walk
and<00:02:22.640> replant<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.269> seeds<00:02:23.300> anyway<00:02:23.959> so<00:02:24.019> what's

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
and replant the seeds anyway so what's

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.220 
and replant the seeds anyway so what's
the<00:02:24.620> whole<00:02:24.830> point<00:02:24.860> of<00:02:25.160> that<00:02:25.340> unless<00:02:26.209> you<00:02:26.420> want

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
the whole point of that unless you want

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.750 
the whole point of that unless you want
to<00:02:27.290> be<00:02:27.380> lazy<00:02:27.560> and<00:02:27.739> don't<00:02:28.010> want<00:02:28.069> to<00:02:28.190> replant<00:02:28.610> the

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
to be lazy and don't want to replant the

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.300 
to be lazy and don't want to replant the
seeds<00:02:29.170> but<00:02:30.170> yeah<00:02:30.530> so<00:02:30.860> I'm<00:02:30.950> just<00:02:31.100> going<00:02:31.220> to

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
seeds but yeah so I'm just going to

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.600 
seeds but yeah so I'm just going to
finish<00:02:31.459> collecting<00:02:32.329> all<00:02:32.840> this<00:02:33.019> and<00:02:33.290> from<00:02:34.130> four

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
finish collecting all this and from four

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.819 
finish collecting all this and from four
modules<00:02:34.850> or<00:02:35.329> four<00:02:35.660> yeah<00:02:36.049> like<00:02:36.320> four<00:02:36.620> modules

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:36.829 
modules or four yeah like four modules

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:40.319 
modules or four yeah like four modules
of<00:02:37.280> this<00:02:37.459> you<00:02:37.610> get<00:02:37.730> about<00:02:37.970> five<00:02:38.420> stacks<00:02:38.780> of

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 
of this you get about five stacks of

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:43.509 
of this you get about five stacks of
seed<00:02:41.329> I<00:02:41.360> think<00:02:41.720> I<00:02:42.019> think<00:02:42.560> five<00:02:42.799> stacks<00:02:43.130> a<00:02:43.280> seat

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
seed I think I think five stacks a seat

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.699 
seed I think I think five stacks a seat
and<00:02:43.700> then<00:02:43.850> a<00:02:43.880> couple<00:02:44.150> stacks<00:02:44.540> of<00:02:44.810> wheat<00:02:45.530> I

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
and then a couple stacks of wheat I

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.569 
and then a couple stacks of wheat I
forgot<00:02:46.450> what<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.570> numbers<00:02:47.930> were<00:02:47.959> but<00:02:48.440> yeah<00:02:49.190> so

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
forgot what the numbers were but yeah so

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:52.720 
forgot what the numbers were but yeah so
let<00:02:49.880> me<00:02:49.940> just<00:02:50.120> put<00:02:50.329> this<00:02:50.360> away<00:02:50.630> and<00:02:51.340> we<00:02:52.340> can<00:02:52.549> get

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
let me just put this away and we can get

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.030 
let me just put this away and we can get
into<00:02:53.799> actually<00:02:54.799> how<00:02:55.100> you<00:02:55.720> how<00:02:56.720> this<00:02:56.840> works<00:02:57.110> so

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
into actually how you how this works so

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.340 
into actually how you how this works so
I'm<00:02:58.489> not<00:02:58.700> going<00:02:58.880> to<00:02:58.970> go<00:02:59.150> into<00:02:59.299> like<00:02:59.810> actually

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
I'm not going to go into like actually

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.319 
I'm not going to go into like actually
how<00:03:00.410> you<00:03:00.470> build<00:03:01.010> this<00:03:01.220> because<00:03:02.000> it's<00:03:02.150> pretty

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
how you build this because it's pretty

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:04.360 
how you build this because it's pretty
self-explanatory<00:03:02.690> I<00:03:03.320> mean<00:03:03.530> this<00:03:04.040> is<00:03:04.250> the

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
self-explanatory I mean this is the

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.020 
self-explanatory I mean this is the
wiring<00:03:04.760> on<00:03:04.880> top<00:03:05.090> very<00:03:05.570> basic<00:03:06.170> but<00:03:06.850> let's<00:03:07.850> get

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
wiring on top very basic but let's get

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.039 
wiring on top very basic but let's get
get<00:03:08.390> into<00:03:08.600> this<00:03:08.720> so<00:03:10.570> first<00:03:11.570> I'm<00:03:11.780> going<00:03:11.870> to<00:03:11.959> talk

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
get into this so first I'm going to talk

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.890 
get into this so first I'm going to talk
about<00:03:12.230> lighting<00:03:12.620> right<00:03:12.950> here<00:03:13.190> so<00:03:13.940> wheat<00:03:14.450> needs

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
about lighting right here so wheat needs

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.039 
about lighting right here so wheat needs
a<00:03:15.049> light<00:03:15.290> level<00:03:15.620> of<00:03:15.829> at<00:03:16.310> least<00:03:16.430> 15<00:03:17.120> or<00:03:17.390> not<00:03:17.750> of

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
a light level of at least 15 or not of

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:21.490 
a light level of at least 15 or not of
at<00:03:18.650> least<00:03:18.799> nine<00:03:19.160> to<00:03:19.340> grow<00:03:19.579> and<00:03:20.079> redstone<00:03:21.079> lamps

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
at least nine to grow and redstone lamps

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.580 
at least nine to grow and redstone lamps
give<00:03:21.560> out<00:03:21.799> a<00:03:22.100> light<00:03:22.310> level<00:03:22.640> of<00:03:22.880> 15<00:03:23.450> so<00:03:23.870> let<00:03:24.560> me

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
give out a light level of 15 so let me

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.030 
give out a light level of 15 so let me
get<00:03:24.799> out<00:03:24.920> some<00:03:25.310> glass

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
get out some glass

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.140 
get out some glass
I<00:03:26.900> can<00:03:27.900> never<00:03:28.079> find<00:03:28.349> anything<00:03:28.500> here<00:03:29.099> we<00:03:29.250> go<00:03:29.370> so

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
I can never find anything here we go so

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.059 
I can never find anything here we go so
I'm<00:03:30.420> I<00:03:30.719> believe<00:03:30.959> this<00:03:31.109> is<00:03:31.230> correct<00:03:31.590> all<00:03:31.829> around

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
I'm I believe this is correct all around

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.839 
I'm I believe this is correct all around
this<00:03:33.030> redstone<00:03:33.420> lamp<00:03:33.719> is<00:03:34.019> 15<00:03:34.650> a<00:03:35.010> light<00:03:35.549> level

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
this redstone lamp is 15 a light level

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:40.280 
this redstone lamp is 15 a light level
of<00:03:36.030> 15<00:03:36.540> right<00:03:37.049> ok<00:03:37.829> so<00:03:38.599> this<00:03:39.599> block<00:03:40.049> right<00:03:40.079> here

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
of 15 right ok so this block right here

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.780 
of 15 right ok so this block right here
this<00:03:40.500> piece<00:03:40.680> of<00:03:40.799> glass<00:03:40.950> would<00:03:41.159> be<00:03:41.280> light<00:03:41.549> level

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
this piece of glass would be light level

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.509 
this piece of glass would be light level
15<00:03:42.299> then<00:03:42.750> this<00:03:42.930> next<00:03:43.230> one<00:03:43.349> be<00:03:43.530> 14<00:03:44.329> 13<00:03:45.329> 12<00:03:45.599> 11<00:03:46.519> 10

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
15 then this next one be 14 13 12 11 10

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.880 
15 then this next one be 14 13 12 11 10
and<00:03:47.879> the<00:03:48.120> 9<00:03:48.299> I<00:03:48.329> think<00:03:48.659> it<00:03:48.720> did<00:03:48.810> that<00:03:48.959> right<00:03:49.109> 15

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
and the 9 I think it did that right 15

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:55.509 
and the 9 I think it did that right 15
14<00:03:50.370> 13<00:03:50.640> 12<00:03:51.329> 11<00:03:51.900> 10<00:03:52.620> and<00:03:53.370> 9<00:03:53.790> so<00:03:54.239> right<00:03:54.569> here<00:03:54.840> is<00:03:54.870> um

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
14 13 12 11 10 and 9 so right here is um

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.399 
14 13 12 11 10 and 9 so right here is um
the<00:03:56.519> light<00:03:56.700> level<00:03:57.000> we<00:03:57.299> can<00:03:57.540> grow<00:03:57.750> at<00:03:57.930> in<00:03:58.200> net

00:03:58.399 --> 00:03:58.409 
the light level we can grow at in net

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:01.429 
the light level we can grow at in net
for<00:03:58.889> the<00:03:59.430> diagonal<00:04:00.090> parts<00:04:00.389> right<00:04:00.510> here<00:04:00.569> it

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:01.439 
for the diagonal parts right here it

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:13.429 
for the diagonal parts right here it
would<00:04:01.590> be<00:04:01.739> like<00:04:02.720> 15<00:04:03.720> 14<00:04:04.709> 13<00:04:06.620> 12<00:04:07.620> 11<00:04:10.519> 11<00:04:11.519> 10<00:04:12.079> 9<00:04:13.079> and

00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:13.439 
would be like 15 14 13 12 11 11 10 9 and

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:19.879 
would be like 15 14 13 12 11 11 10 9 and
so<00:04:14.430> on<00:04:14.609> so<00:04:16.160> now<00:04:17.160> that<00:04:17.190> you<00:04:17.459> know<00:04:18.139> you<00:04:19.139> know<00:04:19.650> the

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
so on so now that you know you know the

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.159 
so on so now that you know you know the
light<00:04:20.160> level<00:04:20.459> that<00:04:20.820> redstone<00:04:21.449> lamps<00:04:21.810> give<00:04:21.870> off

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
light level that redstone lamps give off

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:23.740 
light level that redstone lamps give off
you<00:04:22.440> just<00:04:22.620> have<00:04:22.740> to<00:04:22.770> incorporate<00:04:23.190> that

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
you just have to incorporate that

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.560 
you just have to incorporate that
incorporate<00:04:24.750> that<00:04:24.990> into<00:04:25.940> actual<00:04:26.940> one<00:04:27.330> module

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
incorporate that into actual one module

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.510 
incorporate that into actual one module
so<00:04:28.169> another<00:04:28.620> thing<00:04:28.740> I'm<00:04:29.039> going<00:04:29.130> to<00:04:29.190> talk<00:04:29.340> about

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
so another thing I'm going to talk about

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.750 
so another thing I'm going to talk about
it<00:04:29.849> really<00:04:30.270> quickly<00:04:30.510> is<00:04:31.220> water<00:04:32.220> right<00:04:32.580> here

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
it really quickly is water right here

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.020 
it really quickly is water right here
until<00:04:32.940> did<00:04:33.389> dirt<00:04:33.840> so<00:04:34.680> as<00:04:35.520> you<00:04:35.580> can<00:04:35.820> see<00:04:36.000> right

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
until did dirt so as you can see right

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.120 
until did dirt so as you can see right
here<00:04:36.360> we<00:04:36.570> have<00:04:36.780> a<00:04:36.990> water<00:04:37.320> source<00:04:37.650> block<00:04:37.949> right

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
here we have a water source block right

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.120 
here we have a water source block right
here<00:04:38.159> and<00:04:38.580> it<00:04:38.699> is<00:04:38.880> able<00:04:39.449> to<00:04:39.599> till<00:04:40.289> a<00:04:40.560> nine<00:04:40.889> by

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
here and it is able to till a nine by

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.420 
here and it is able to till a nine by
nine<00:04:42.020> it's<00:04:43.020> able<00:04:43.409> to<00:04:43.440> fertilize<00:04:43.710> a<00:04:43.949> nine<00:04:44.250> by

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
nine it's able to fertilize a nine by

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.550 
nine it's able to fertilize a nine by
nine<00:04:44.550> square<00:04:45.060> right<00:04:45.210> here<00:04:45.270> from<00:04:45.780> this<00:04:45.930> central

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
nine square right here from this central

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.610 
nine square right here from this central
water<00:04:47.039> source<00:04:47.340> block<00:04:47.610> because<00:04:48.380> four<00:04:49.380> blocks

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
water source block because four blocks

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.430 
water source block because four blocks
away<00:04:49.770> from<00:04:49.970> the<00:04:50.970> water<00:04:51.150> is<00:04:51.510> able<00:04:51.930> to<00:04:52.050> be<00:04:52.080> tilled

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
away from the water is able to be tilled

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.159 
away from the water is able to be tilled
so<00:04:52.710> one<00:04:53.220> two<00:04:53.699> three<00:04:54.180> four<00:04:54.479> you<00:04:54.810> see<00:04:54.990> I<00:04:55.020> have

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
so one two three four you see I have

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.800 
so one two three four you see I have
four<00:04:55.440> block<00:04:55.680> for<00:04:56.250> dirt<00:04:56.520> blocks<00:04:56.789> from<00:04:56.909> here<00:04:57.210> dad

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
four block for dirt blocks from here dad

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.200 
four block for dirt blocks from here dad
diagonally<00:04:58.770> one<00:04:59.070> two<00:04:59.220> three<00:04:59.250> four<00:04:59.460> and<00:04:59.760> then

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
diagonally one two three four and then

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.529 
diagonally one two three four and then
all<00:05:00.360> around<00:05:00.690> to<00:05:00.810> making<00:05:00.990> nine<00:05:01.500> by<00:05:01.680> nine<00:05:01.860> square

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:02.539 
all around to making nine by nine square

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:05.870 
all around to making nine by nine square
then<00:05:03.539> don't<00:05:04.530> pay<00:05:04.680> attention<00:05:04.770> to<00:05:05.159> those<00:05:05.340> glass

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
then don't pay attention to those glass

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.580 
then don't pay attention to those glass
imagine<00:05:06.419> this<00:05:06.510> as<00:05:06.570> a<00:05:06.750> stone<00:05:07.199> brick<00:05:07.440> or

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
imagine this as a stone brick or

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.820 
imagine this as a stone brick or
whatever<00:05:07.830> right<00:05:08.820> here<00:05:09.210> is<00:05:09.479> the<00:05:09.750> setup<00:05:10.169> for<00:05:10.710> the

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
whatever right here is the setup for the

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.250 
whatever right here is the setup for the
lights<00:05:11.070> right<00:05:11.310> here<00:05:11.520> it's<00:05:11.699> very<00:05:12.000> simple<00:05:12.300> from

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
lights right here it's very simple from

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.020 
lights right here it's very simple from
the<00:05:13.409> corners<00:05:13.800> you<00:05:14.010> will<00:05:14.130> have<00:05:14.250> to<00:05:14.610> write<00:05:14.849> here

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
the corners you will have to write here

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.290 
the corners you will have to write here
this<00:05:15.300> is<00:05:15.510> three<00:05:15.960> high<00:05:16.340> so<00:05:17.340> directly<00:05:17.940> above

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
this is three high so directly above

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.000 
this is three high so directly above
your<00:05:18.720> dirt<00:05:19.020> here<00:05:19.260> you're<00:05:19.440> going<00:05:19.530> to<00:05:19.590> have<00:05:19.860> to

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
your dirt here you're going to have to

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.300 
your dirt here you're going to have to
build<00:05:20.190> a<00:05:20.280> ceiling<00:05:20.669> three<00:05:21.150> high<00:05:21.330> and<00:05:21.570> then<00:05:22.409> from

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
build a ceiling three high and then from

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.249 
build a ceiling three high and then from
the<00:05:23.430> corners<00:05:23.849> on<00:05:24.120> the<00:05:24.360> sides<00:05:24.570> you<00:05:24.840> have<00:05:24.870> stone

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:25.259 
the corners on the sides you have stone

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:27.350 
the corners on the sides you have stone
brick<00:05:25.530> here<00:05:25.800> or<00:05:25.889> whatever<00:05:26.130> you<00:05:26.310> want<00:05:26.520> from<00:05:27.240> the

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
brick here or whatever you want from the

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.689 
brick here or whatever you want from the
corners<00:05:27.690> you<00:05:27.840> count<00:05:28.050> 12<00:05:28.590> then<00:05:28.949> place<00:05:29.280> a<00:05:29.310> lamp

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:29.699 
corners you count 12 then place a lamp

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:33.210 
corners you count 12 then place a lamp
one<00:05:30.449> to<00:05:30.659> place<00:05:31.020> the<00:05:31.169> lamp<00:05:31.470> 12<00:05:32.400> +<00:05:32.639> lamb

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220 
one to place the lamp 12 + lamb

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.010 
one to place the lamp 12 + lamb
or<00:05:33.310> from<00:05:33.520> the<00:05:33.640> central<00:05:34.030> you<00:05:34.180> go<00:05:34.330> one<00:05:34.630> place<00:05:34.930> a

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
or from the central you go one place a

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.220 
or from the central you go one place a
lamp<00:05:35.380> one<00:05:35.590> place<00:05:35.920> a<00:05:35.950> lamp<00:05:36.280> so<00:05:37.060> this<00:05:38.020> is

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:38.230 
lamp one place a lamp so this is

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.950 
lamp one place a lamp so this is
basically<00:05:38.530> what<00:05:38.920> I<00:05:38.980> had<00:05:39.160> over<00:05:39.370> here<00:05:39.870> so<00:05:40.870> you

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
basically what I had over here so you

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.980 
basically what I had over here so you
can<00:05:41.140> see<00:05:41.350> right<00:05:41.560> here<00:05:42.570> would<00:05:43.570> be<00:05:43.600> like<00:05:43.870> the

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
can see right here would be like the

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.590 
can see right here would be like the
central<00:05:44.500> this<00:05:45.430> would<00:05:45.610> be<00:05:45.700> that<00:05:45.880> this<00:05:46.240> is<00:05:46.300> where

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
central this would be that this is where

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.080 
central this would be that this is where
the<00:05:46.780> water<00:05:46.960> this<00:05:47.860> water<00:05:48.130> source<00:05:48.490> block<00:05:48.730> is<00:05:48.910> is

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 
the water this water source block is is

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.590 
the water this water source block is is
right<00:05:49.330> there<00:05:49.540> and<00:05:50.170> then<00:05:50.980> one<00:05:51.670> then<00:05:51.940> the<00:05:52.360> lamp

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 
right there and then one then the lamp

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.870 
right there and then one then the lamp
is<00:05:52.780> placed<00:05:53.050> and<00:05:53.350> then<00:05:53.620> they're<00:05:54.040> like<00:05:54.370> that<00:05:54.610> and

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
is placed and then they're like that and

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.300 
is placed and then they're like that and
then<00:05:55.510> because<00:05:56.320> this<00:05:56.470> is<00:05:56.590> all<00:05:56.740> symmetrical

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
then because this is all symmetrical

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.730 
then because this is all symmetrical
it's<00:05:57.520> pretty<00:05:57.760> easy<00:05:57.970> to<00:05:58.390> figure<00:05:58.750> out<00:05:59.290> where<00:05:59.560> the

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
it's pretty easy to figure out where the

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.920 
it's pretty easy to figure out where the
other<00:06:00.070> lamps<00:06:00.430> are<00:06:00.640> supposed<00:06:00.850> to<00:06:00.940> go<00:06:01.150> just<00:06:01.810> by

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
other lamps are supposed to go just by

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.770 
other lamps are supposed to go just by
looking<00:06:02.260> at<00:06:02.350> the<00:06:02.740> one<00:06:03.040> you<00:06:03.310> have<00:06:03.430> right<00:06:03.460> here

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 
looking at the one you have right here

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.000 
looking at the one you have right here
and<00:06:04.780> then<00:06:04.900> you<00:06:05.020> just<00:06:05.170> wire<00:06:05.410> it<00:06:05.560> up<00:06:05.650> pretty

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.010 
and then you just wire it up pretty

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.190 
and then you just wire it up pretty
self-explanatory<00:06:06.550> you<00:06:07.180> just<00:06:07.360> torch<00:06:07.750> and<00:06:08.080> then

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:08.200 
self-explanatory you just torch and then

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.070 
self-explanatory you just torch and then
yeah<00:06:08.740> so<00:06:09.580> there's<00:06:09.940> actually<00:06:10.240> two<00:06:10.510> parts<00:06:10.780> to

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
yeah so there's actually two parts to

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.920 
yeah so there's actually two parts to
this<00:06:11.230> and<00:06:12.100> actually<00:06:13.060> let<00:06:13.450> me<00:06:13.510> just<00:06:13.690> show<00:06:13.900> you

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
this and actually let me just show you

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.440 
this and actually let me just show you
really<00:06:14.170> quick<00:06:14.440> when<00:06:14.830> I<00:06:14.860> flip<00:06:15.220> this<00:06:15.370> lever<00:06:15.610> you

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:16.450 
really quick when I flip this lever you

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.000 
really quick when I flip this lever you
can<00:06:16.630> see<00:06:16.780> that<00:06:16.960> the<00:06:17.080> whole<00:06:17.290> room<00:06:17.470> gets<00:06:17.680> dark

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.010 
can see that the whole room gets dark

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.910 
can see that the whole room gets dark
and<00:06:18.250> these<00:06:18.850> doors<00:06:19.210> closed<00:06:19.510> right<00:06:19.780> here<00:06:20.080> and

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:20.920 
and these doors closed right here and

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.920 
and these doors closed right here and
the<00:06:21.100> reason<00:06:21.280> why<00:06:21.520> I<00:06:21.550> do<00:06:21.760> that<00:06:22.120> is<00:06:22.330> because<00:06:22.570> you

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:22.930 
the reason why I do that is because you

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.430 
the reason why I do that is because you
want<00:06:23.110> this<00:06:23.260> room<00:06:23.440> to<00:06:23.500> be<00:06:23.710> completely<00:06:24.250> dark

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 
want this room to be completely dark

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.290 
want this room to be completely dark
when<00:06:26.440> you<00:06:26.620> harvest<00:06:27.130> you<00:06:27.730> don't<00:06:27.910> want<00:06:28.090> any

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.300 
when you harvest you don't want any

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.420 
when you harvest you don't want any
light<00:06:28.600> through<00:06:28.870> so<00:06:29.200> you<00:06:29.230> don't<00:06:29.530> get<00:06:29.710> any<00:06:29.980> wheat

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.430 
light through so you don't get any wheat

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.580 
light through so you don't get any wheat
on<00:06:30.640> the<00:06:30.730> side<00:06:30.940> here<00:06:31.300> that<00:06:31.480> didn't<00:06:31.840> harvest<00:06:32.320> and

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:32.590 
on the side here that didn't harvest and

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:34.350 
on the side here that didn't harvest and
then<00:06:33.010> you<00:06:33.070> have<00:06:33.160> to<00:06:33.280> hit<00:06:33.460> it<00:06:33.520> all<00:06:33.760> and<00:06:34.090> then<00:06:34.210> as

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360 
then you have to hit it all and then as

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.970 
then you have to hit it all and then as
you<00:06:34.480> can<00:06:34.630> see<00:06:34.750> will<00:06:34.900> automatically<00:06:35.500> harvest

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:35.980 
you can see will automatically harvest

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:39.990 
you can see will automatically harvest
like<00:06:36.669> that<00:06:36.880> now<00:06:37.690> some<00:06:38.470> problems<00:06:38.919> with<00:06:39.040> bigger

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.000 
like that now some problems with bigger

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.940 
like that now some problems with bigger
larger<00:06:40.480> farms<00:06:40.990> like<00:06:41.140> this<00:06:41.320> is<00:06:41.500> obviously<00:06:41.860> lag

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:43.950 
larger farms like this is obviously lag

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:45.630 
larger farms like this is obviously lag
especially<00:06:44.950> if<00:06:45.010> you<00:06:45.100> don't<00:06:45.250> have<00:06:45.340> that<00:06:45.400> good

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:45.640 
especially if you don't have that good

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.570 
especially if you don't have that good
of<00:06:45.700> a<00:06:45.820> computer<00:06:46.210> and<00:06:46.450> another<00:06:46.810> one<00:06:47.050> would<00:06:47.470> be

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:47.580 
of a computer and another one would be

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:52.290 
of a computer and another one would be
because<00:06:48.630> mobs<00:06:49.630> can<00:06:50.020> spawn<00:06:50.640> in<00:06:51.640> a<00:06:51.760> light<00:06:51.970> level

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:52.300 
because mobs can spawn in a light level

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:57.030 
because mobs can spawn in a light level
of<00:06:52.540> seven<00:06:53.110> I<00:06:53.290> think<00:06:53.800> seven<00:06:54.520> or<00:06:54.729> below<00:06:55.169> so<00:06:56.169> even

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:57.040 
of seven I think seven or below so even

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.000 
of seven I think seven or below so even
if<00:06:57.190> it<00:06:57.310> was<00:06:57.460> like<00:06:57.640> for<00:06:57.910> split<00:06:58.240> second<00:06:58.860> if<00:06:59.860> you

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.010 
if it was like for split second if you

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:03.409 
if it was like for split second if you
have<00:07:00.160> all<00:07:00.370> the<00:07:00.490> caves<00:07:00.729> lit<00:07:01.120> up<00:07:01.300> around<00:07:01.900> you<00:07:02.200> and

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:03.419 
have all the caves lit up around you and

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:05.969 
have all the caves lit up around you and
there's<00:07:04.419> like<00:07:04.630> nowhere<00:07:04.930> other<00:07:05.290> place<00:07:05.680> where

00:07:05.969 --> 00:07:05.979 
there's like nowhere other place where

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:07.530 
there's like nowhere other place where
mobs<00:07:06.190> can<00:07:06.460> spawn<00:07:06.640> they're<00:07:06.880> obviously<00:07:07.270> going

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:07.540 
mobs can spawn they're obviously going

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.990 
mobs can spawn they're obviously going
to<00:07:07.630> spawn<00:07:07.960> in<00:07:08.260> your<00:07:08.620> little<00:07:09.160> wheat<00:07:09.460> farm<00:07:09.760> here

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.000 
to spawn in your little wheat farm here

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.030 
to spawn in your little wheat farm here
so<00:07:10.300> what<00:07:11.200> you're<00:07:11.350> going<00:07:11.470> to<00:07:11.560> want<00:07:11.710> to<00:07:11.800> do<00:07:11.919> is

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:12.040 
so what you're going to want to do is

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.130 
so what you're going to want to do is
you<00:07:12.070> want<00:07:12.160> to<00:07:12.310> keep<00:07:12.490> it<00:07:12.729> low<00:07:13.300> like<00:07:13.330> maybe<00:07:13.810> four

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:14.140 
you want to keep it low like maybe four

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:16.409 
you want to keep it low like maybe four
modules<00:07:14.350> here<00:07:14.890> it<00:07:15.070> would<00:07:15.190> be<00:07:15.340> good<00:07:15.520> because

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:16.419 
modules here it would be good because

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:18.719 
modules here it would be good because
mobs<00:07:16.960> cannot<00:07:17.290> spawned<00:07:17.650> 20<00:07:18.190> blocks<00:07:18.370> away<00:07:18.700> from

00:07:18.719 --> 00:07:18.729 
mobs cannot spawned 20 blocks away from

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:21.630 
mobs cannot spawned 20 blocks away from
you<00:07:19.090> so<00:07:19.320> yeah<00:07:20.320> so<00:07:20.650> just<00:07:20.680> something<00:07:21.160> to<00:07:21.280> keep<00:07:21.490> in

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:21.640 
you so yeah so just something to keep in

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.950 
you so yeah so just something to keep in
mind<00:07:22.710> and<00:07:23.710> then<00:07:24.370> the<00:07:24.669> wiring<00:07:25.120> for<00:07:25.360> the<00:07:25.390> piston

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:25.960 
mind and then the wiring for the piston

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.240 
mind and then the wiring for the piston
door<00:07:26.110> here<00:07:26.320> is<00:07:26.410> pretty<00:07:26.800> self-explanatory

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:27.250 
door here is pretty self-explanatory

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:31.050 
door here is pretty self-explanatory
it's<00:07:28.030> just<00:07:29.040> not<00:07:30.040> letting<00:07:30.280> me<00:07:30.370> fly<00:07:30.550> okay<00:07:31.000> so

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:31.060 
it's just not letting me fly okay so

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.380 
it's just not letting me fly okay so
it's<00:07:31.479> just<00:07:31.600> I've<00:07:32.320> redstone<00:07:33.000> under<00:07:34.000> here<00:07:34.210> that

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:34.390 
it's just I've redstone under here that

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:36.500 
it's just I've redstone under here that
will<00:07:34.570> just<00:07:35.110> go<00:07:35.260> into<00:07:35.530> the<00:07:35.620> Pistons<00:07:35.979> and<00:07:36.130> power

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:36.510 
will just go into the Pistons and power

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:40.280 
will just go into the Pistons and power
so<00:07:37.500> that<00:07:38.250> is<00:07:38.580> the<00:07:38.610> light<00:07:39.180> switch<00:07:39.510> weed<00:07:39.990> farm

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:40.290 
so that is the light switch weed farm

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.230 
so that is the light switch weed farm
and<00:07:40.500> I<00:07:40.800> just<00:07:40.950> explained<00:07:41.340> to<00:07:41.370> you<00:07:41.550> how<00:07:41.580> you<00:07:41.880> can
