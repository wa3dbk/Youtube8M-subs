00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.490
 we found six daughters

 what to keep 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:27.419
 currently there may be 120 thousand hectares of these 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:33.599
 look at tasks strong defense is usual the two uniformed the colorados not 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.649
 the sanctuary 

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:44.789
 that forest project 

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:47.789
 largest of the mountains of Mary and it becomes 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.329
 in an important support for the province more 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.650
 an increase of more than 40 mammals has been recorded in terms of avifauna 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:02.019
 between the portraits moment 256 unemployed 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.619

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:06.019
 46 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.599
 they are migratory 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.689
 It is important to highlight the importance of the sanctuary for migratory birds 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:13.970
 since they become 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.130
 jae repudio power 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.860
 to know that they visit us between the months of September and October at the end 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.259
 of March 

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:24.459
 then with a very important strategic point 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.719
 for the conservation of these birds this significant number is very important 

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:31.539
 since in Colombia there are 

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:33.079
 very few places 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:34.679
 with more than 40 

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:37.149
 migratory bird species 

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:39.709
 and it becomes can be in 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.349
 to the important 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:44.049
 walls development of victory 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.049
 as one try it 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.049
 for the conservation and protection of birds 

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:54.169
 the monitoring 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:55.540
 in the sanctuary 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.819
 It is done systematically 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:59.559
 and planned 

00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:01.759
 during tours 

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:03.779
 previously planned 

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:05.359
 data is taken 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:07.099
 in terms of fame 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:11.609
 they evaluate is a behavior sun state 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.289
 in terms of population this data 

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:15.870
 they pass 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.529
 to Marta 

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:19.289
 which are analyzed 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:22.400
 the maps are generated through the cic de san juan a 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.580
 and through this a decision will be made regarding conservation 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.449
 of the species 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:29.969
 the flora 

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:32.659
 its distribution in the area is determined 

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:35.120
 phenology data are taken 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.979
 then collect seeds and they are reproduced as plant material for 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:43.090
 repopulation project of the times in me in the same saints 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:45.499
 the fable 

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:49.270
 of the colorado fauna and flora sanctuary in general is located in 

00:04:49.269 --> 00:04:50.779
 Good condition 

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:54.559
 but due to the degree of isolation in which this protected area is located 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.840
 The expansion is urgent and necessary, either ahota the patches 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.200
 of forest through corridors that connect the sanctuary and this form 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.680
 expand the vital area of ​​the species 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.759
 we are moving slowly but surely towards the expansion of the sanctuary and 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:11.280
 there are important steps 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.350
 for an effective connection and very surely it's going to be a fact 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.860
 the expansion of this protected area 

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:27.550
 we are developing the environmental education strategy 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.419
 conservation and preservation of the natural and cultural resources of 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:32.379
 municipality 

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:33.849
 in that way as it is not 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:37.139
 municipality of colombia and lung of the montes de maría 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:40.680
 This strategy has been significant because we have had the 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.150
 accompaniment of the educational institution 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.180
 isea have strengthened the communications collective 

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:50.409
 environmental that is one of the strategies that raised the education project 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:51.620
 environmental 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.030
 and the most significant thing is that the community 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.029
 has rated 

00:05:56.029 --> 00:06:00.479
 the sanctuary of fauna and flora and has appropriated this process as their own 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:03.710
 we identify a conservation culture 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.830
 and preservation of natural and cultural resources 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.900
 It was important to link young girls and teenagers to the process of 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:11.949
 open voting 

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:16.449
 because we understand that this generation is fulfilling a significant role for the 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:18.259
 valuation of Tahrir Square 

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:21.699
 and in the future we are seeing many projects that will defend this 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:24.939
 generation is our grandparents and the researchers 

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:26.969
 we have found that 

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:30.129
 the culture depends on the Malibu is 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:33.690
 claimed that this habit this region of which 

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:36.279
 that apart 

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:38.659
 the colorado sanctuary of flora and fauna 

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:43.789
 the most important thing that were the manuel serrano that inhabited the human being and 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:45.300
 they used everything is everything 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.120
 as their territory we learned the culture of conservation and 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.120
 preservation act natural resources therefore our sanctuary will 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.279
 converts into natural heritage of animals
