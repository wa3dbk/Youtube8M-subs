00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.909
 May together today I wanted you 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.270
 Show me how this wedding 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:09.030
 have made inspired nail art and 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:14.070
 Let's go with the studio as always 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:17.150
 nails top coat railways i wear 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.430
 on all lines on after that comes 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.960
 red thread son pale pink 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.090
 nail polish is just looking for me 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.869
 except that I have now the of 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.060
 new dawn french set will be the first 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.570
 design then you need a glitter top 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.370
 I have those from this coat as well 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.950
 always eat cele this last one 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.890
 taken current and you carry on 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.690
 the lower half of the nail up and 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.190
 The glitter particles try so far 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.870
 but to push down as possible 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.969
 it's normal automatically so so that 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.829
 one relatively above in the middle of the 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.840
 nail relatively little glitter particles 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.199
 has and then further down 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.199
 pull 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.530
 and after all that a bit 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.649
 I have dried one more 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.030
 given that layer so that me 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.090
 really a lot of glitter at the top 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:11.490
 So have my arsonist complete 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:13.820
 covered with glitter so it looks 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.820
 then get out 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.250
 for the second you need the 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.080
 dining table painter or just stop 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.820
 a white nail polish unfortunately that's me 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.400
 Picture blurred I do not know 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.650
 but ultimately, you just have to 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.600
 just a white tip in a bow 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.700
 you see the result the same as 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.680
 that looks and I have the left 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.290
 pulled to the right in such a triangle 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.030
 with such a curved arch at the 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.530
 tv interest so he quite a lot of paint 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.970
 that's why I have one more 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.399
 have to apply a bit of the whole 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.909
 that's not so thick 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.680
 and funny gaelic looks but on 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.950
 just take a white tip 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.579
 triangle and now comes the 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.070
 offender in metallic jumpy with it I paint 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.110
 now a few accents with go there 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.579
 I just go along this arch 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.950
 See also how this arch looks 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.689
 then walk along as you can see 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.560
 this too takes up too much color 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.129
 So this one needs a little bit now 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.380
 be distributed and it works like one 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:19.850
 top 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:23.140
 the white tip along and will now 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:27.380
 distributed differently and in addition to that 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.510
 Two arrows, so to speak , go into the 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:35.590
 opposite direction once from the 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.590
 in the middle of the nail that comes from and now 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.260
 just pull in like this 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.580
 Of course you do a lot of foresting 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.980
 somehow comes some leaves or 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:50.000
 so reinbauen and once on the white 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.780
 tip once again simple 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.430
 easy to have its accents in it 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.440
 the next variant is with one 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.900
 stamp technique and for that I have mine 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.880
 set of essens also the template of 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.390
 Essens, however, is from an older one 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.010
 version so I think they have after 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.200
 the range changeover bit 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.330
 other templates in it but had it around 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.690
 blÃ¼mchen reinke with the right everywhere 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.370
 apply normally after varnish 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.410
 stamp and there it must be there on the 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.890
 stamp and then simply nail 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.890
 transfer 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.300
 Finished off the last one is actually 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.680
 so simple for those who really 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.300
 a bit subtle anyway 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.450
 want to have failed 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.090
 for that i have the hint ainedter of 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.890
 Taken in a metallic 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.350
 and I'm just the tip of 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:43.370
 a little finger in this so with 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:45.709
 This nail polish is painted so 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.709
 actually a breakfast just stop in 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.880
 metallic champaign and the whole thing 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.070
 I made a bit wider what we did 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.610
 at the beginning of this very thin then 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:57.530
 this time was and just nicely distributed 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.730
 so i can be very good to somehow 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.959
 still champagne colors and clyde 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:05.180
 not everybody knows wearing white and 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:08.209
 seal all designs again with the 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:11.360
 it instruments bed jamie glossy 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:14.180
 no idea top coat is still 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.970
 my absolute favorite and that are the ones 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.560
 finished t write me in 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.570
