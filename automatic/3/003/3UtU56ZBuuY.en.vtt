00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
I want to show you kind of work we're

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.280

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
talking about here there's a little

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.030 
talking about here there's a little
flange<00:01:49.710> here<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.850> steps<00:01:51.210> out<00:01:51.860> about<00:01:52.860> an

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
flange here that steps out about an

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.240 
flange here that steps out about an
eighth<00:01:53.189> of<00:01:53.369> an<00:01:53.490> inch<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:54.229> made<00:01:55.229> my<00:01:55.380> panel<00:01:55.860> so

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
eighth of an inch I made my panel so

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.450 
eighth of an inch I made my panel so
leaky<00:01:57.110> right<00:01:58.110> into<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:58.530> flange<00:01:58.920> which<00:01:59.280> it

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
leaky right into that flange which it

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.030 
leaky right into that flange which it
does

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
does

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.910 
does
and<00:02:00.370> then<00:02:01.180> so<00:02:01.390> that<00:02:01.420> it<00:02:01.660> would<00:02:01.810> follow<00:02:03.360> pci

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
and then so that it would follow pci

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.300 
and then so that it would follow pci
backplane<00:02:06.150> perfectly<00:02:07.200> touching<00:02:08.200> it<00:02:08.350> can't

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
backplane perfectly touching it can't

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.150 
backplane perfectly touching it can't
get<00:02:09.460> any<00:02:09.520> tighter<00:02:09.910> and<00:02:10.869> i<00:02:11.320> made<00:02:11.560> it<00:02:11.680> so<00:02:11.890> that<00:02:11.920> it

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
get any tighter and i made it so that it

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.960 
get any tighter and i made it so that it
would<00:02:12.280> have<00:02:13.020> absolutely<00:02:14.020> no<00:02:14.200> gap<00:02:14.470> and<00:02:15.100> fit

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
would have absolutely no gap and fit

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.950 
would have absolutely no gap and fit
this<00:02:16.150> panel<00:02:16.950> perfectly<00:02:18.960> ok<00:02:19.960> you<00:02:20.860> see<00:02:21.130> all

they're<00:04:52.470> specially<00:04:53.010> shaped<00:04:53.280> in<00:04:53.550> the<00:04:53.580> back<00:04:53.880> to

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
they're specially shaped in the back to

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.960 
they're specially shaped in the back to
fit<00:04:54.630> them<00:04:54.900> so<00:04:55.860> they<00:04:55.980> have<00:04:56.130> a<00:04:56.160> round<00:04:56.460> front<00:04:56.790> and
