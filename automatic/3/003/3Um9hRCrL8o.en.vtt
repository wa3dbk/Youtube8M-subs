00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
and you risk melting parts of the light

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.200 
and you risk melting parts of the light
when<00:00:31.170> you<00:00:31.289> bake<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.619> make<00:00:31.830> sure<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:32.210> nothing

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
when you bake it make sure that nothing

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.110 
when you bake it make sure that nothing
touches<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.719> metal<00:00:33.870> like<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.649> sides<00:00:35.120> like

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
touches the metal like the sides like

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.330 
touches the metal like the sides like
this<00:00:36.180> part<00:00:36.690> make<00:00:37.350> sure<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.590> this<00:00:37.890> doesn't

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
this part make sure that this doesn't

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.389 
this part make sure that this doesn't
touch<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.850> side<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.600> your<00:00:39.719> oven<00:00:40.190> many<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.309> the

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
touch the side of your oven many of the

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.299 
touch the side of your oven many of the
corners<00:00:41.730> don't<00:00:41.930> okay<00:00:42.930> so<00:00:43.020> once<00:00:43.410> it's<00:00:43.980> based

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
corners don't okay so once it's based

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.850 
corners don't okay so once it's based
and<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.730> take<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.270> out<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.510> oven<00:00:45.860> might

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
and you take it out of the oven might

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.639 
and you take it out of the oven might
have<00:00:47.070> already<00:00:47.219> opened<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.000> it's<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.660> lot<00:00:49.530> easier

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
have already opened so it's a lot easier

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.819 
have already opened so it's a lot easier
to<00:00:49.860> open<00:00:50.100> one<00:00:50.390> you<00:00:51.390> just<00:00:51.570> take<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.829> flathead

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
to open one you just take a flathead

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.160 
to open one you just take a flathead
screwdriver

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
screwdriver

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.139 
screwdriver
something<00:00:55.170> like<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:55.610> preferably<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.640> big<00:00:56.940> one

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
something like this preferably a big one

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.389 
something like this preferably a big one
because<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.199> bigger<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.500> more<00:00:58.800> leverage<00:00:59.219> you

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
because the bigger the more leverage you

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.790 
because the bigger the more leverage you
can<00:00:59.430> get<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.390> like<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.320> said<00:01:01.530> it's<00:01:01.649> pretty

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
can get and like I said it's pretty

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
now they still it the fit that Nissan

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.639 
now they still it the fit that Nissan

so<00:02:11.400> you're<00:02:11.489> gonna<00:02:11.610> have<00:02:11.790> some<00:02:12.330> issues<00:02:12.360> with

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
so you're gonna have some issues with

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.930 
so you're gonna have some issues with
I<00:02:13.260> right<00:02:14.260> here<00:02:14.770> as<00:02:14.950> you<00:02:15.370> can<00:02:15.520> see<00:02:15.670> there's<00:02:15.880> a

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
I right here as you can see there's a

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.780 
I right here as you can see there's a
clip<00:02:16.390> that<00:02:16.690> is<00:02:17.530> attached<00:02:18.130> to<00:02:18.280> this<00:02:18.460> chrome

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
clip that is attached to this chrome

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.330 
clip that is attached to this chrome
piece<00:02:18.820> and<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:20.050> sealant<00:02:20.560> helped<00:02:20.860> hold<00:02:21.070> it<00:02:21.220> in

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
piece and the sealant helped hold it in

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.060 
piece and the sealant helped hold it in
place<00:02:21.460> so<00:02:22.390> I<00:02:22.420> took<00:02:22.540> just<00:02:22.990> a<00:02:23.140> razor<00:02:23.470> blade<00:02:23.710> and<00:02:23.980> I

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
place so I took just a razor blade and I

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.610 
place so I took just a razor blade and I
try<00:02:24.400> to<00:02:24.430> cut<00:02:24.760> some<00:02:24.970> of<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.120> sealant<00:02:25.600> also<00:02:26.260> like

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
try to cut some of the sealant also like

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.100 
try to cut some of the sealant also like
I<00:02:26.740> said<00:02:26.950> it<00:02:27.100> helps<00:02:27.370> a<00:02:27.580> lot<00:02:28.000> really<00:02:28.750> a<00:02:28.870> lot<00:02:29.080> to

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
I said it helps a lot really a lot to

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.840 
I said it helps a lot really a lot to
have<00:02:29.410> a<00:02:29.440> heat<00:02:29.740> gun<00:02:29.980> so<00:02:30.190> you<00:02:30.340> could<00:02:30.459> heat<00:02:30.670> it<00:02:30.790> up

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
have a heat gun so you could heat it up

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.190 
have a heat gun so you could heat it up
because<00:02:31.000> this<00:02:31.150> stuff<00:02:31.360> gets<00:02:31.570> really<00:02:31.810> hard<00:02:31.959> once

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
because this stuff gets really hard once

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.080 
because this stuff gets really hard once
it<00:02:32.320> starts<00:02:32.530> to<00:02:32.560> cool<00:02:32.740> down<00:02:32.950> with<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.760> heat<00:02:33.940> gun

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
it starts to cool down with the heat gun

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.120 
it starts to cool down with the heat gun
you<00:02:34.150> could<00:02:34.420> heat<00:02:35.230> it<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.500> it<00:02:35.620> starts<00:02:35.860> to<00:02:35.950> get<00:02:36.100> a

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
you could heat it and it starts to get a

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.400 
you could heat it and it starts to get a
little<00:02:36.250> weaker<00:02:37.240> and<00:02:37.750> with<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:37.959> razor<00:02:38.140> blade

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
little weaker and with the razor blade

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.970 
little weaker and with the razor blade
just<00:02:38.620> cut<00:02:38.860> it<00:02:39.010> so<00:02:39.640> this<00:02:39.790> part<00:02:40.060> comes<00:02:40.240> off<00:02:40.980> once

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
just cut it so this part comes off once

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.790 
just cut it so this part comes off once
you<00:02:42.130> unscrew<00:02:42.400> this<00:02:42.959> this<00:02:43.959> chrome<00:02:44.290> piece<00:02:44.500> comes

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
you unscrew this this chrome piece comes

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.660 
you unscrew this this chrome piece comes
out<00:02:44.980> and<00:02:46.830> then<00:02:47.830> there's<00:02:48.070> a<00:02:48.130> screw<00:02:48.489> right<00:02:48.520> here

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
out and then there's a screw right here

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.699 
out and then there's a screw right here
and<00:02:49.620> a<00:02:50.620> screw<00:02:50.980> right<00:02:51.010> here<00:02:51.220> and<00:02:52.320> I<00:02:53.320> believe

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
and a screw right here and I believe

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.410 
and a screw right here and I believe
that's<00:02:53.890> it<00:02:54.220> and<00:02:54.459> then<00:02:54.610> you<00:02:54.730> could<00:02:54.880> separate

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
that's it and then you could separate

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.680 
that's it and then you could separate
the<00:02:56.170> rest<00:02:56.440> of<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:56.770> light<00:02:56.950> from<00:02:57.459> the<00:02:58.360> clear

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
the rest of the light from the clear

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.810 
the rest of the light from the clear
part<00:02:58.930> and<00:02:59.440> once<00:02:59.890> you've<00:03:00.010> separated<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:00.640> rest

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
part and once you've separated the rest

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:06.900 
part and once you've separated the rest
of<00:03:00.970> the<00:03:01.060> light<00:03:03.360> you<00:03:04.360> could<00:03:04.510> then<00:03:05.220> paint<00:03:06.220> it<00:03:06.370> and

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
of the light you could then paint it and

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.000 
of the light you could then paint it and
then<00:03:07.870> after<00:03:08.200> you<00:03:08.290> paint<00:03:08.500> it<00:03:08.650> you<00:03:08.800> just

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
then after you paint it you just

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.290 
then after you paint it you just
reassemble<00:03:09.940> it<00:03:10.270> and<00:03:10.620> yeah<00:03:11.940> put<00:03:12.940> it<00:03:13.030> back<00:03:13.150> in

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
reassemble it and yeah put it back in

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.170 
reassemble it and yeah put it back in
the<00:03:13.420> oven<00:03:14.280> heat<00:03:15.280> it<00:03:15.430> up<00:03:15.489> a<00:03:15.640> little<00:03:15.790> bit<00:03:15.940> just<00:03:15.970> to

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
the oven heat it up a little bit just to

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.960 
the oven heat it up a little bit just to
weaken<00:03:16.630> the<00:03:16.840> sealant<00:03:20.100> pretty<00:03:21.100> much<00:03:21.250> apply

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
weaken the sealant pretty much apply

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.410 
weaken the sealant pretty much apply
some<00:03:22.209> force<00:03:23.280> with<00:03:24.280> me<00:03:24.519> I<00:03:24.549> ended<00:03:24.910> up<00:03:25.150> just<00:03:25.330> using

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
some force with me I ended up just using

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.180 
some force with me I ended up just using
some<00:03:26.049> random<00:03:27.480> clear<00:03:28.480> silicone<00:03:29.380> that<00:03:29.650> my

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
some random clear silicone that my

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.150 
some random clear silicone that my
friend<00:03:30.459> had<00:03:30.670> and<00:03:31.470> let's<00:03:32.470> see<00:03:32.590> how<00:03:32.739> that<00:03:32.920> works

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
friend had and let's see how that works

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.280 
friend had and let's see how that works
hopefully<00:03:34.000> that<00:03:34.360> works<00:03:34.510> good<00:03:34.780> and<00:03:34.840> my<00:03:35.049> lights

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
hopefully that works good and my lights

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.100 
hopefully that works good and my lights
hold<00:03:35.530> up<00:03:35.680> and<00:03:35.860> I<00:03:35.920> don't<00:03:36.070> have<00:03:36.220> any<00:03:36.400> sort<00:03:36.640> of
