00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:07.050
 you are immediately given such a blogs 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:10.410
 such a snowball you do not need as in 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.209
 last release click well let me 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.950
 eg 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.560
 things are there on the green button and he just 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.430
 gives a snowball and you just take and throw 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:25.500
 this snowball and here you see here 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:28.620
 Here they are located at home as if they climbed 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.230
 these are the blocks I think he doesn't 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.920
 will make such with them but that's what he 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.530
 vyperla blocks us but the main thing away 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.489
 from buildings to do this can be done on 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.830
 your server build a new city with 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.610
 skyscrapers then pop there dudes 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.040
 but 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.690
 or how to sell these premises as 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.510
 hotel or something 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.730
 and on the server it will look very 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.310
 cool after you line up 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.430
 the city is now finished with us 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:02.160
 here are the cuttings and this one this building 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.250
 for example yes was built already here 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:09.170
 several buildings that we have 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.750
 under the house that we have it loaded for a long time 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:15.080
 I get over a long time I do not understand why 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:18.990
 this is probably because I built it 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:21.930
 here is this car so we have 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:24.240
 little is not being completed there and we are not 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.930
 I'm given a snowball de Building today 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:31.950
 machines too, and build this car 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:37.280

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.840

 dungeons on the server so that you have it 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.840
