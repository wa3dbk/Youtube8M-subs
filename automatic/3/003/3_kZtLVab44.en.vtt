a bunch of energy what we have over here
is<00:00:46.729> an<00:00:46.879> example<00:00:47.720> of<00:00:47.960> one<00:00:48.350> of<00:00:48.379> the<00:00:48.530> traps<00:00:51.610> called

a figure 4 deadfall trap essentially the
setup<00:00:56.750> we<00:00:56.900> have<00:00:57.049> going<00:00:57.379> here<00:00:57.620> is<00:00:57.710> a

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:58.339 
setup we have going here is a

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:24.969 
setup we have going here is a
combination<00:00:59.299> of<00:00:59.390> the<00:00:59.510> modern<00:01:00.309> world<00:01:18.700> we<00:01:23.979> have

combination of the modern world we have

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.880 
combination of the modern world we have
a<00:01:25.039> log<00:01:25.280> underneath<00:01:25.840> so<00:01:26.840> you<00:01:27.170> get<00:01:27.439> that<00:01:27.590> hammer

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
a log underneath so you get that hammer

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.010 
a log underneath so you get that hammer
and<00:01:28.130> anvil<00:01:28.280> effect<00:01:28.820> of<00:01:29.060> the<00:01:29.179> top<00:01:29.390> log<00:01:29.659> getting

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
and anvil effect of the top log getting

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.830 
and anvil effect of the top log getting
the<00:01:30.109> bottom<00:01:30.259> log<00:01:30.820> and<00:01:31.820> what<00:01:32.030> happens<00:01:32.479> is<00:01:32.689> on

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
the bottom log and what happens is on

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.310 
the bottom log and what happens is on
the<00:01:32.899> inside<00:01:33.109> of<00:01:33.560> this<00:01:33.710> concrete<00:01:34.670> tube<00:01:35.030> is<00:01:35.359> the

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
the inside of this concrete tube is the

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.289 
the inside of this concrete tube is the
head<00:01:37.100> of<00:01:37.340> a<00:01:37.460> beaver<00:01:37.640> that<00:01:38.000> we<00:01:38.149> trap<00:01:38.420> and

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
head of a beaver that we trap and

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.609 
head of a beaver that we trap and
basically<00:01:41.299> what's<00:01:41.719> gonna<00:01:41.840> happen<00:01:41.960> or<00:01:42.469> what

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
basically what's gonna happen or what

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.499 
basically what's gonna happen or what
hopefully<00:01:43.189> would<00:01:43.280> happen<00:01:43.670> is<00:01:43.820> that<00:01:44.030> some

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
hopefully would happen is that some

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.310 
hopefully would happen is that some
animal<00:01:44.929> a<00:01:44.960> raccoon<00:01:45.439> opossum<00:01:45.799> maybe<00:01:47.320> they're

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
animal a raccoon opossum maybe they're

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.050 
animal a raccoon opossum maybe they're
wandering<00:01:48.829> around<00:01:48.920> the<00:01:49.159> woods<00:01:49.189> smelling

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
wandering around the woods smelling

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.580 
wandering around the woods smelling
looking<00:01:50.359> for<00:01:50.570> food<00:01:50.749> they<00:01:50.960> catch<00:01:51.170> wind<00:01:51.200> of<00:01:51.530> that

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
looking for food they catch wind of that

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.130 
looking for food they catch wind of that
beavers<00:01:52.070> beaver<00:01:52.579> head<00:01:52.759> in<00:01:52.909> there<00:01:53.090> they<00:01:53.899> come

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
beavers beaver head in there they come

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.529 
beavers beaver head in there they come
down<00:01:54.289> the<00:01:54.469> path<00:01:54.679> here<00:01:55.069> and<00:01:55.310> in<00:01:55.789> order<00:01:56.060> order<00:01:56.390> to

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
down the path here and in order order to

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:58.809 
down the path here and in order order to
get<00:01:56.749> into<00:01:57.140> the<00:01:57.229> concrete<00:01:57.710> tube<00:01:57.979> they're<00:01:58.729> gonna

00:01:58.809 --> 00:01:58.819 
get into the concrete tube they're gonna

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:00.819 
get into the concrete tube they're gonna
have<00:01:58.999> to<00:01:59.060> brush<00:01:59.390> right<00:01:59.689> by<00:01:59.929> the<00:01:59.990> trigger<00:02:00.439> stick

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
have to brush right by the trigger stick

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.069 
have to brush right by the trigger stick
on<00:02:01.069> that<00:02:01.100> figure<00:02:01.579> for<00:02:01.819> traffic<00:02:02.390> which<00:02:02.899> is

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
on that figure for traffic which is

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:04.599 
on that figure for traffic which is
basically<00:02:03.530> a<00:02:03.649> long<00:02:03.890> stick<00:02:04.249> and<00:02:04.280> we<00:02:04.490> have<00:02:04.579> a

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:04.609 
basically a long stick and we have a

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:07.239 
basically a long stick and we have a
branch<00:02:04.939> tied<00:02:05.270> to<00:02:05.509> it<00:02:05.659> and<00:02:06.499> what's<00:02:06.710> essentially

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:07.249 
branch tied to it and what's essentially

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:09.160 
branch tied to it and what's essentially
gonna<00:02:07.369> happen<00:02:07.819> and<00:02:08.149> I'll<00:02:08.240> set<00:02:08.509> this<00:02:08.630> trap<00:02:08.840> off

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
gonna happen and I'll set this trap off

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.930 
gonna happen and I'll set this trap off
here<00:02:09.500> or<00:02:10.369> would<00:02:10.640> hopefully<00:02:10.850> happen

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
here or would hopefully happen

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:20.280 
here or would hopefully happen
is<00:02:13.940> that<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:18.530> animals<00:02:18.920> gonna<00:02:19.040> come<00:02:19.310> along<00:02:19.430> and

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
is that the animals gonna come along and

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.559 
is that the animals gonna come along and
it's<00:02:21.290> going<00:02:21.500> to<00:02:21.590> as<00:02:21.980> it<00:02:22.250> tries<00:02:22.430> to<00:02:22.610> enter<00:02:23.000> this

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
it's going to as it tries to enter this

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.899 
it's going to as it tries to enter this
tube<00:02:23.840> do<00:02:24.110> you<00:02:24.170> get<00:02:24.349> the<00:02:24.500> beaver<00:02:25.129> skull<00:02:25.430> it's

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:25.909 
tube do you get the beaver skull it's

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:27.490 
tube do you get the beaver skull it's
gonna<00:02:26.030> hit<00:02:26.269> this<00:02:26.420> stick<00:02:26.810> and<00:02:26.840> I'm<00:02:27.110> going<00:02:27.260> to<00:02:27.319> do

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
gonna hit this stick and I'm going to do

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.839 
gonna hit this stick and I'm going to do
this<00:02:27.650> and<00:02:27.980> move<00:02:28.190> out<00:02:28.340> of<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.519> way<00:02:28.549> very

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
this and move out of the way very

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:35.170 
this and move out of the way very
quickly<00:02:29.530> like<00:02:30.530> so<00:02:33.610> obviously<00:02:34.610> the<00:02:34.849> animal

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
quickly like so obviously the animal

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.059 
quickly like so obviously the animal
trips<00:02:35.450> that<00:02:35.659> that<00:02:36.200> log<00:02:36.440> isn't<00:02:36.709> gonna<00:02:36.799> come

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
trips that that log isn't gonna come

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.640 
trips that that log isn't gonna come
down<00:02:37.280> on<00:02:37.489> the<00:02:37.610> Ted<00:02:37.849> and<00:02:38.599> very<00:02:38.959> quickly<00:02:39.349> and

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
down on the Ted and very quickly and

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.740 
down on the Ted and very quickly and
humanely<00:02:39.950> end<00:02:40.370> its<00:02:40.549> life<00:02:40.640> you<00:02:41.090> know<00:02:41.390> whenever

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
humanely end its life you know whenever
