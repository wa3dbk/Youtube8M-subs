00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.720

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.110
 the model in the description 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.840
 for those who would be interested it is 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.690
 really an excellent microphone I have to say 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.390

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.640
