00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
different color or here's another one in

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.679 
different color or here's another one in
that<00:00:25.140> pack<00:00:25.470> see<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.099> back<00:00:26.279> was<00:00:26.670> dead<00:00:27.150> design

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
that pack see the back was dead design

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.389 
that pack see the back was dead design
so<00:00:28.380> it's<00:00:28.650> all<00:00:28.859> white<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:29.779> black<00:00:30.779> this<00:00:31.230> paper<00:00:31.529> so

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
so it's all white in black this paper so

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.660 
so it's all white in black this paper so
you<00:00:32.430> can<00:00:32.610> add<00:00:33.059> colors<00:00:33.860> like<00:00:34.860> this<00:00:35.070> one<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.340> use

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
you can add colors like this one I use

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.540 
you can add colors like this one I use
the<00:00:35.910> green<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.739> orange<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:38.010> then<00:00:38.309> they

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
the green the orange and then they

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.069 
the green the orange and then they
yellow<00:00:39.210> so<00:00:39.480> that<00:00:39.690> would<00:00:40.020> be<00:00:41.570> by<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.629> way<00:00:42.840> it's

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
yellow so that would be by the way it's

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.200 
yellow so that would be by the way it's
not<00:00:43.260> marker<00:00:43.710> it's<00:00:43.890> blendabilities<00:00:44.399> so<00:00:45.090> it

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
not marker it's blendabilities so it

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.410 
not marker it's blendabilities so it
works<00:00:45.539> awesome<00:00:46.260> for<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.760> ear<00:00:48.149> it

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
works awesome for that and the ear it

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.860 
works awesome for that and the ear it
was<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:49.280> the<00:00:50.280> rich<00:00:50.460> Razzleberry<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.329> think<00:00:51.750> it

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870

can<00:02:13.769> see<00:02:14.010> what<00:02:14.159> I'm<00:02:14.310> talking<00:02:14.849> about<00:02:16.069> like<00:02:17.069> this

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
can see what I'm talking about like this

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.220 
can see what I'm talking about like this
and<00:02:17.579> then<00:02:17.849> come<00:02:18.090> back<00:02:18.120> with<00:02:18.510> your<00:02:18.720> brush<00:02:18.989> and

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
and then come back with your brush and

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.270 
and then come back with your brush and
just<00:02:19.560> blend<00:02:19.709> it<00:02:20.750> and<00:02:21.750> when<00:02:22.439> you<00:02:22.620> blend<00:02:22.950> the

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
just blend it and when you blend the

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.179 
just blend it and when you blend the
brush<00:02:23.549> it's<00:02:23.819> not<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.329> best<00:02:24.569> friendly<00:02:25.439> one<00:02:25.890> to

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:26.189 
brush it's not the best friendly one to

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:29.330 
brush it's not the best friendly one to
blend<00:02:26.489> wit<00:02:26.819> I<00:02:27.060> like<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.629> have<00:02:27.750> this<00:02:28.340> sharper

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
blend wit I like to have this sharper

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.119 
blend wit I like to have this sharper
tip<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:29.939> smaller<00:02:30.239> tip<00:02:30.599> but<00:02:31.290> it<00:02:31.470> still<00:02:31.829> work

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
tip the smaller tip but it still work

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.369 
tip the smaller tip but it still work
you<00:02:32.400> can<00:02:32.609> see<00:02:32.970> maybe<00:02:33.540> I<00:02:33.659> should<00:02:33.750> bring<00:02:34.230> it

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
you can see maybe I should bring it

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.309 
you can see maybe I should bring it
closer<00:02:34.859> you<00:02:35.640> can<00:02:35.849> see<00:02:35.909> you<00:02:36.359> get<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:36.750> two-tone

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
closer you can see you get the two-tone

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.160 
closer you can see you get the two-tone
there<00:02:37.739> it's<00:02:38.430> just<00:02:38.760> that<00:02:38.939> it<00:02:39.120> will<00:02:39.420> not<00:02:39.720> lend

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
there it's just that it will not lend

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.520 
there it's just that it will not lend
like<00:02:40.620> another<00:02:41.250> white<00:02:42.090> cardstock<00:02:42.540> it's<00:02:43.140> still

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
like another white cardstock it's still

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.610 
like another white cardstock it's still
blend<00:02:43.890> but<00:02:44.310> not<00:02:44.519> the<00:02:44.700> same<00:02:44.959> so<00:02:45.959> that's<00:02:46.170> how<00:02:46.319> I

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
blend but not the same so that's how I

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.259 
blend but not the same so that's how I
add<00:02:46.980> color<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:47.579> my<00:02:48.920> cards<00:02:49.920> not<00:02:50.459> cardstock<00:02:51.000> but

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.930 
add color to my cards not cardstock but

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.050 
design your paper black to black this
one<00:02:54.299> here<00:02:54.810> when<00:02:55.620> I<00:02:55.650> color<00:02:56.040> this<00:02:56.340> one<00:02:56.639> over<00:02:57.030> here

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
one here when I color this one over here

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.839 
one here when I color this one over here
when<00:02:57.959> I<00:02:57.989> was<00:02:58.319> done<00:02:58.590> it<00:02:58.889> looked<00:02:59.250> like<00:02:59.370> it<00:02:59.519> looked

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
when I was done it looked like it looked

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.720 
when I was done it looked like it looked
darker<00:03:00.450> where<00:03:00.810> I<00:03:01.019> pass<00:03:01.530> so<00:03:02.099> I<00:03:02.129> went<00:03:02.639> through

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
darker where I pass so I went through

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.940 
darker where I pass so I went through
the<00:03:03.030> whole<00:03:03.239> thing<00:03:03.299> pretty<00:03:03.870> much<00:03:03.989> and<00:03:04.349> wipe<00:03:04.709> it

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
the whole thing pretty much and wipe it

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.729 
the whole thing pretty much and wipe it
not<00:03:05.370> wipe<00:03:05.670> it<00:03:05.939> but<00:03:06.180> you<00:03:06.750> know<00:03:06.780> color<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.470> black

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
not wipe it but you know color the black

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.390 
not wipe it but you know color the black
but<00:03:08.459> I<00:03:08.639> think<00:03:09.450> that<00:03:09.689> if<00:03:09.959> I<00:03:10.170> were<00:03:10.349> to<00:03:10.409> wait

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
but I think that if I were to wait

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.970 
but I think that if I were to wait
patiently<00:03:11.840> it<00:03:12.840> woulda<00:03:13.170> went<00:03:13.409> away<00:03:13.620> it's

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
patiently it woulda went away it's

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.330 
patiently it woulda went away it's
because<00:03:14.069> it<00:03:14.430> was<00:03:14.670> kind<00:03:15.060> of<00:03:15.209> still<00:03:15.569> wet<00:03:16.200> so<00:03:16.560> see

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
because it was kind of still wet so see

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.270 
because it was kind of still wet so see
you<00:03:17.519> just<00:03:17.849> color<00:03:18.180> here<00:03:18.660> and<00:03:18.690> there<00:03:19.139> so<00:03:20.069> that's

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
you just color here and there so that's

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.479 
you just color here and there so that's
a<00:03:20.519> way<00:03:20.730> that<00:03:21.030> you<00:03:21.299> can<00:03:21.540> add<00:03:21.870> color<00:03:22.349> and<00:03:22.680> you

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
a way that you can add color and you

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.520 
a way that you can add color and you
don't<00:03:23.699> have<00:03:23.849> to<00:03:24.030> color<00:03:24.239> the<00:03:24.480> whole<00:03:24.810> thing<00:03:25.290> you

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
don't have to color the whole thing you

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.979 
don't have to color the whole thing you
can<00:03:25.769> just<00:03:26.040> color<00:03:26.310> a<00:03:26.430> few<00:03:26.879> piece<00:03:27.180> here<00:03:27.540> and

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
can just color a few piece here and

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.270 
can just color a few piece here and
there<00:03:28.290> just<00:03:28.530> add<00:03:29.310> some<00:03:29.370> pop<00:03:30.150> on<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.750> paper<00:03:31.280> so

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280
