00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.680
 hello sir, welcome to the modest Taste video recipes section 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:18.360
 today we will share a different description specific to our beautiful city, our capital city, Ankara 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.200
 "Spoon Throw" 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.520
 but if you want to learn the necessary materials before 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.480
 1 piece of egg 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.920
 2 cups of water 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.560
 4 glasses of flour 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.120
 1 teaspoon salt 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.000
 For the above; 2 tablespoons of butter 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.760
 250 grams of tulum cheese 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.520
 and half a glass of walnut 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.520
 now we know the materials necessary for spoon throwing 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.120
 let's go first to the furnace to boil water 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.480
 we put the pot on fire 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:15.160
 1 - 1.5 liters of water are leaving 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.040
 add some salt 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.040
 and we're going to mix our dough 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.040
 Now we can beat our dough 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.040
 we said we have one egg 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.040
 water... 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.080
 and salt 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.080
 a nice mix 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.880
 4 x cups 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.960
 but let's not give up the measure, let's add half before 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.040
 whisking, the rest of us 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.920
 let's add some more 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.800
 dough 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.040
 now we have added the last remaining 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.440
 full 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.640
 but as we say there is a difference from cup to cup 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.640
 important consistency 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.880
 this is our consistency 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.440
 we can cook our dough 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.880
 the water started to boil, we first wet our spoon 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.320
 Spoon with the dough we prepared ... 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.160
 boil 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.440
 dough 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.720
 doughs hit the water's face 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.200
 now we are getting a rough 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.480
 remaining doughs will continue to boil in the same way 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.680
 we took the last doughs, now let's prepare for service 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.480
 Yeah, spoonflat is OK, let's go to the final touches. 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.480
 butter 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.480
 Ankara people practicing people 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.520
 in such a short time such a rare condition 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.400
 now we're sprinkling a lot of coconut on it 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:55.120
 Finally, we grate on the grated cheese, preferably tulum cheese. 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.120
 I will give this cheese already taste 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.080
 eating with appetite 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.040
 Modest Flavors in this part of the kitchen ... 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.600
 we shared a recipe for local and different pastries 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.680
 We learned the construction of "Spoon Throw" 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.800
 I would like you to remember your experiment, us and Ankara 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.600
 Goodbye sir ...
