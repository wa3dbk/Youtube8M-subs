stoic<00:01:33.359> Otto<00:01:34.100> white<00:01:35.100> mass<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.520> very<00:01:35.700> fast<00:01:36.359> and

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:37.620 
stoic Otto white mass is very fast and

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.360 
stoic Otto white mass is very fast and
in<00:01:37.890> gville<00:01:38.280> deserts<00:01:38.850> much<00:01:39.390> more<00:01:40.100> much<00:01:41.100> more

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.370 
in gville deserts much more much more

00:01:41.370 --> 00:02:31.210 
in gville deserts much more much more
slow<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.890> the<00:01:43.890> result<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:44.880> different

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:40.330 

which<00:02:32.220> is<00:02:32.489> a<00:02:35.480> which<00:02:36.480> is<00:02:36.629> a<00:02:36.690> big<00:02:36.959> vintage<00:02:38.360> here

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
which is a which is a big vintage here

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.470 
which is a which is a big vintage here
2004<00:02:42.380> is<00:02:43.380> a<00:02:43.440> very<00:02:43.830> good<00:02:43.920> vintage<00:02:44.280> made<00:02:45.030> me<00:02:45.269> more

classic maybe more for aging I don't
know<00:02:50.150> but<00:02:51.150> 2005<00:02:52.080> as<00:02:52.319> this<00:02:52.440> kind<00:02:52.739> of<00:02:53.000> richness

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
know but 2005 as this kind of richness

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:02.630 
know but 2005 as this kind of richness
and<00:02:59.540> so<00:03:00.540> here<00:03:00.870> we<00:03:01.049> have<00:03:01.080> sixty<00:03:01.799> percent<00:03:01.980> of

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
and so here we have sixty percent of

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.839 
and so here we have sixty percent of
connection<00:03:04.040> and<00:03:05.040> then<00:03:05.730> we<00:03:05.940> have<00:03:06.150> 15<00:03:06.769> novella

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
connection and then we have 15 novella

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:12.920 
connection and then we have 15 novella
15cm<00:03:08.849> ha<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:09.769> then<00:03:10.769> we<00:03:10.980> have<00:03:11.010> a<00:03:11.730> touch<00:03:12.450> of<00:03:12.660> sin

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
15cm ha and then we have a touch of sin

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.160 
15cm ha and then we have a touch of sin
showing<00:03:13.470> clear<00:03:13.829> that<00:03:14.040> this<00:03:14.459> white<00:03:14.790> wave<00:03:15.170> there

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
showing clear that this white wave there

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.729 
showing clear that this white wave there
too<00:03:18.319> so<00:03:19.319> that<00:03:19.530> was<00:03:19.769> built<00:03:20.069> on<00:03:20.250> in<00:03:20.579> July<00:03:21.380> and<00:03:22.380> now

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
too so that was built on in July and now

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.479 
too so that was built on in July and now
we<00:03:23.370> began<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:24.060> gender<00:03:24.840> step<00:03:25.260> of<00:03:25.530> this<00:03:26.160> voyage

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
we began the gender step of this voyage

00:03:26.489 --> 00:04:28.810 
we began the gender step of this voyage
is<00:03:26.880> vintage<00:03:28.400> next<00:03:29.400> last<00:03:30.000> attempt

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.990 

the<00:04:29.820> ones<00:04:30.060> which<00:04:30.390> are<00:04:30.600> used<00:04:30.870> here<00:04:31.550> an<00:04:32.550> average

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
the ones which are used here an average

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.880 
the ones which are used here an average
of<00:04:33.210> 60<00:04:33.690> years<00:04:33.870> old<00:04:34.790> so<00:04:35.870> we<00:04:36.870> know<00:04:37.080> that<00:04:37.110> these

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
of 60 years old so we know that these

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.680 
of 60 years old so we know that these
lines<00:04:38.430> are<00:04:39.050> able<00:04:40.050> to<00:04:40.260> produce<00:04:40.500> the<00:04:41.250> schedule

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
lines are able to produce the schedule

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:47.030 
lines are able to produce the schedule
