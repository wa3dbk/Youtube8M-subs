00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.749
 today we prepare a recipe with that 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.850
 that put me in the fridge a 

00:00:33.749 --> 00:00:39.210
 a little bit of mortadella a little flat 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.609
 spicy a little bit of raisin a 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.370
 little bit of speck maybe in this case 

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:47.010
 of use to prepare a meeting a 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.199
 salami base and for this preparation 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.269
 I also need some tomatoes 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:54.929
 pine nuts datterini 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:56.219
 I was slightly baked eight 

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:58.729
 I like them better in this 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.889
 preparation is a bit of aromatic herbs 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:05.820
 sage and rosemary thyme the 

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:07.979
 parsley extra virgin olive oil and a little 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.350
 of salt pepper to taste 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.460
 then we begin the preparation 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:18.270
 Meanwhile, cut the cherry tomatoes 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.729
 even here we make cubes then 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.240
 we make these cherry tomatoes 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.520
 jump yourself in a pan with 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.840
 oil with extra virgin olive oil 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.590
 take the shallots to clean and 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.689
 debris years 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:41.179
 let's try to make them quite fine but 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:43.069
 it doesn't really matter to make them mush or 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:46.789
 I think quite big stairs 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:49.340
 that the medium will be could also be 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:54.740
 just put the pan on 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:58.780
 fire we put the oil 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.780
 themes let's brown quickly 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:10.860
 I'm thinking view of a shallot 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:14.190
 before that in blond ska 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.020
 add the meats we do it 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.610
 flavor well 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:25.260
 we always keep the flame very high 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:28.890
 so that we have a browning and not 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.690
 a boiling at this point we can 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.000
 take our glass of wine 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:37.590
 white and put in a medium 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.990
 let's leave the glass to fade for good 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.700
 because we want it to evaporate all over 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.130
 the acidity of the wine 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.230
 now add the tomatoes that 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.810
 we have previously jumped into 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.340
 this recipe we could also use gods 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:56.490
 dried tomatoes so we avoid perhaps 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:59.630
 this phase of cooking that you can but 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:03.330
 some people slow down the kitchen slows down 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:06.270
 we say that this preparation results 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:10.380
 already quite tasty if we put the 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:13.410
 dry tomatoes will certainly become 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.350
 even tastier so I recommend it 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.390
 to use fresh tomatoes and indeed 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.209
 try not to add salt during 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:25.190
 the preparation because in the end we will have 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.190
 really a too tasty dish 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:32.690
 waiting for the tomatoes to be ready 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.599
 we can also add before the 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.430
 cherry tomatoes and immediately the cherry tomatoes 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:41.450
 half of the chopped herbs that 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:44.239
 we prepared earlier then 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.300
 add the tomatoes we make 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:49.370
 add flavor for a moment we put the 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.780
 pine nuts that car was slightly in 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.780
 oven before this preparation 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.950
 we can put out the fire and add 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:02.940
 the chopped herbs are set on fire 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:06.209
 aromatic that we did not put before 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.209
 here we are 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.290
 the dish is ready our ragÃ¹ of 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.810
 cold cuts and ready we can use it 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:17.430
 on a short pasta like strozzapreti a 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.430
 what I'd like to do
