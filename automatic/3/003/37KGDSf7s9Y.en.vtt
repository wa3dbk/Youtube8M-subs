hi<00:00:01.319> everybody<00:00:01.949> this<00:00:02.490> is<00:00:02.760> the<00:00:03.000> video<00:00:03.120> for<00:00:03.510> week

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
hi everybody this is the video for week

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.130 
hi everybody this is the video for week
3<00:00:04.020> of<00:00:04.230> X<00:00:04.620> I<00:00:04.770> 232<00:00:05.660> this<00:00:06.660> week<00:00:06.870> we<00:00:07.049> were

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
3 of X I 232 this week we were

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.080 
3 of X I 232 this week we were
continuing<00:00:07.770> using<00:00:08.130> this<00:00:08.280> new<00:00:08.610> actuarial

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
continuing using this new actuarial

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.820 
continuing using this new actuarial
notation<00:00:09.840> that<00:00:10.019> we<00:00:10.139> introduced<00:00:10.530> at<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.800> end

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
notation that we introduced at the end

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.370 
notation that we introduced at the end
of<00:00:11.040> last<00:00:11.219> week<00:00:11.370> and<00:00:11.730> we<00:00:12.389> actually<00:00:12.540> expressed

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
of last week and we actually expressed

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.200 
of last week and we actually expressed
many<00:00:13.650> of<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.070> earlier<00:00:14.460> results<00:00:14.940> that<00:00:15.089> we've

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
many of the earlier results that we've

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.180 
many of the earlier results that we've

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.580 
already derived in terms of this new
actuarial<00:00:17.580> don't<00:00:18.029> take<00:00:18.210> notation<00:00:18.779> so<00:00:19.410> the

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
actuarial don't take notation so the

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.920 
actuarial don't take notation so the
piece<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.460> probability<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.090> surviving<00:00:21.270> a

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
into the future so there were a number

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.440 
into the future so there were a number
of<00:00:39.719> results<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.260> we<00:00:40.379> can<00:00:40.920> now<00:00:41.730> express<00:00:42.210> using

of results that we can now express using
these<00:00:42.719> new<00:00:42.960> symbols<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.590> two<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.370> most

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
these new symbols and two of the most

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.880 
these new symbols and two of the most
important<00:00:45.059> ones<00:00:45.239> are<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.289> probability

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
important ones are that the probability

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.250 
important ones are that the probability
density<00:00:47.340> function<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.850> T<00:00:48.000> X<00:00:48.180> that's<00:00:48.660> little<00:00:49.079> F

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
density function of T X that's little F

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.459 
density function of T X that's little F
sub<00:00:49.530> X<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.950> T<00:00:50.160> can<00:00:50.969> be<00:00:51.000> expressed<00:00:51.210> as<00:00:51.660> TP<00:00:52.350> x

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
sub X of T can be expressed as TP x

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.100 
sub X of T can be expressed as TP x
times<00:00:53.070> mu<00:00:53.460> X<00:00:53.670> plus<00:00:53.910> T<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.629> that's<00:00:54.809> going<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.020> be

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
times mu X plus T so that's going to be

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.660 
times mu X plus T so that's going to be
really<00:00:55.260> helpful<00:00:55.500> for<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.890> later<00:00:56.070> stuff<00:00:56.370> and

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
really helpful for the later stuff and

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.209 
really helpful for the later stuff and
the<00:00:57.239> other<00:00:57.360> one<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.870> nice<00:00:58.219> relationship

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
the other one is a nice relationship

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.609 
the other one is a nice relationship
that<00:00:59.340> exists<00:00:59.699> between<00:00:59.960> t<00:01:00.960> QX<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:02.719> TP<00:01:03.719> x<00:01:03.840> mu<00:01:04.199> x<00:01:04.379> +

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
that exists between t QX and TP x mu x +

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.550 
that exists between t QX and TP x mu x +
T<00:01:04.799> in<00:01:05.309> fact<00:01:05.580> what<00:01:05.939> we<00:01:06.060> get<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.450> T<00:01:06.780> QX<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.320> just

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
T in fact what we get is T QX is just

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.730 
T in fact what we get is T QX is just
the<00:01:07.650> integral<00:01:08.189> from<00:01:08.700> 0<00:01:09.150> up<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.360> T<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.930> that

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
the integral from 0 up to T of that

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.030 
the integral from 0 up to T of that
probability<00:01:11.220> density<00:01:11.820> function<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:12.860> if<00:01:13.860> we

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
probability density function so if we

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.230 
probability density function so if we
use<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.250> dummy<00:01:14.460> variable<00:01:14.549> we'll<00:01:15.030> have<00:01:15.150> the

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
use a dummy variable we'll have the

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.429 
use a dummy variable we'll have the
integral<00:01:15.390> from<00:01:15.659> 0<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.049> t<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.560> our<00:01:17.280> P<00:01:18.030> X<00:01:18.210> mu<00:01:18.689> x<00:01:18.960> +<00:01:19.229> r

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
integral from 0 to t of our P X mu x + r

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.999 
integral from 0 to t of our P X mu x + r
dr<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.880> all<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.540> just<00:01:21.570> equal<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.080> t<00:01:22.619> QX

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
dr and all of that is just equal to t QX

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.440 
dr and all of that is just equal to t QX
so<00:01:23.790> there<00:01:23.909> were<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.000> number<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.299> other

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
so there were a number of other

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.940 
so there were a number of other
relationships<00:01:25.049> as<00:01:25.200> well<00:01:25.380> but<00:01:25.590> those<00:01:25.740> are<00:01:25.920> just

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
relationships as well but those are just

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.490 
relationships as well but those are just
the<00:01:26.159> two<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.310> wanted<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.729> highlight<00:01:27.320> once<00:01:28.320> we

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
the two I wanted to highlight once we

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.170 
the two I wanted to highlight once we
have<00:01:28.680> those<00:01:28.890> especially<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:29.790> first<00:01:29.939> one<00:01:30.119> I

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
have those especially that first one I

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.850 
have those especially that first one I
mentioned<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.869> probability<00:01:31.710> density

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
mentioned the probability density

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.219 
mentioned the probability density
function<00:01:32.430> we<00:01:32.850> can<00:01:33.030> then<00:01:33.150> calculate<00:01:33.360> moments

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
function we can then calculate moments

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.679 
function we can then calculate moments
of<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:35.250> future<00:01:35.700> life<00:01:35.850> time<00:01:36.030> random<00:01:36.360> variable

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
of the future life time random variable

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.200 
of the future life time random variable
T<00:01:36.869> X<00:01:37.049> so<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.130> first<00:01:38.340> moment<00:01:38.549> obviously<00:01:38.790> the

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
T X so the first moment obviously the

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.490 
T X so the first moment obviously the
one<00:01:39.329> that's<00:01:39.479> most<00:01:39.630> important<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.140> us<00:01:40.229> would<00:01:40.439> be

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
one that's most important to us would be

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.319 
one that's most important to us would be
the<00:01:40.710> mean<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.820> would<00:01:41.909> be<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.119> mean

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
the mean and that would be the mean

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.600 
the mean and that would be the mean
future<00:01:42.780> lifetime<00:01:43.200> or<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:44.009> average<00:01:44.340> future

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
future lifetime or the average future

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.980 
future lifetime or the average future
lifetime<00:01:44.939> or<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.180> expected<00:01:45.479> future<00:01:45.780> lifetime

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
lifetime or the expected future lifetime

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.609 
lifetime or the expected future lifetime
of<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:47.280> life<00:01:47.579> that's<00:01:47.939> currently<00:01:48.329> age<00:01:48.570> X<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.500> we

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
of a life that's currently age X and we

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.910 
of a life that's currently age X and we
call<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.250> circle<00:01:51.000> X<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.530> that's<00:01:52.530> just

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
call that a circle X and that's just

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.280 
call that a circle X and that's just
known<00:01:53.340> as<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.850> complete<00:01:54.329> expectation<00:01:55.140> of

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
known as the complete expectation of

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.340 
known as the complete expectation of
life<00:01:55.470> for<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.040> life<00:01:56.369> Ajax<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:57.960> turns<00:01:58.170> out

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
life for a life Ajax and it turns out

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.219 
life for a life Ajax and it turns out
that<00:01:59.009> if<00:01:59.340> we<00:01:59.729> start<00:02:00.210> by<00:02:00.420> using<00:02:00.899> first

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
that if we start by using first

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.260 
that if we start by using first
principles<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:01.799> expectation<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:02.640> integrate

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
principles of expectation and integrate

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.389 
principles of expectation and integrate
by<00:02:03.450> parts<00:02:03.479> we<00:02:04.380> end<00:02:04.560> up<00:02:04.710> with<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.920> nice<00:02:05.159> simple

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
by parts we end up with a nice simple

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.059 
by parts we end up with a nice simple
formula<00:02:05.909> for<00:02:06.180> e<00:02:06.420> circlex<00:02:06.930> it's<00:02:07.619> just<00:02:07.950> the

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
formula for e circlex it's just the

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.680 
formula for e circlex it's just the
integral<00:02:08.310> from<00:02:08.640> 0<00:02:09.000> all<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.390> way<00:02:09.479> up<00:02:09.569> to

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
integral from 0 all the way up to

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.230 
integral from 0 all the way up to
infinity<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:11.160> survival<00:02:11.580> function<00:02:11.700> t<00:02:12.300> PX<00:02:12.599> d

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
infinity of the survival function t PX d

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.840 
infinity of the survival function t PX d
so<00:02:13.900> that's<00:02:14.050> a<00:02:14.140> pretty<00:02:14.260> nice<00:02:14.470> result<00:02:14.860> we<00:02:15.700> can

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
so that's a pretty nice result we can

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.920 
so that's a pretty nice result we can
also<00:02:16.030> get<00:02:16.360> a<00:02:16.390> result<00:02:16.720> for<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:16.990> variance<00:02:17.410> of<00:02:17.620> TX

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
also get a result for the variance of TX

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.180 
also get a result for the variance of TX
and<00:02:19.930> I<00:02:19.990> didn't<00:02:20.380> write<00:02:20.500> it<00:02:20.620> out<00:02:20.740> and<00:02:20.920> I'm<00:02:21.040> not

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
and I didn't write it out and I'm not

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.460 
and I didn't write it out and I'm not
going<00:02:21.430> to<00:02:21.550> but<00:02:21.880> we<00:02:22.060> can<00:02:22.210> get<00:02:22.390> that<00:02:22.540> as<00:02:22.690> well<00:02:22.720> by

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
going to but we can get that as well by

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.260 
going to but we can get that as well by
first<00:02:23.830> calculate<00:02:24.250> in<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.430> second<00:02:24.790> moment<00:02:25.090> and

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
first calculate in the second moment and

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.240 
first calculate in the second moment and
then<00:02:25.750> subtracting<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.680> first<00:02:26.890> moment

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
then subtracting the first moment

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.990 
then subtracting the first moment
squared<00:02:28.080> from<00:02:29.080> there<00:02:29.350> we<00:02:29.620> moved<00:02:29.860> on<00:02:30.100> to<00:02:30.400> the

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
squared from there we moved on to the

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.730 
squared from there we moved on to the
curt<00:02:31.210> eight<00:02:31.420> future<00:02:32.020> lifetime<00:02:32.440> random

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
curt eight future lifetime random

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.250 
curt eight future lifetime random
variable<00:02:33.130> which<00:02:33.370> is<00:02:33.550> KX<00:02:34.030> and<00:02:34.390> we<00:02:34.870> had<00:02:34.990> to<00:02:35.110> shift

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
variable which is KX and we had to shift

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.470 
variable which is KX and we had to shift
gears<00:02:35.410> a<00:02:35.680> little<00:02:35.740> bit<00:02:35.950> here<00:02:36.250> because<00:02:36.370> KX<00:02:36.910> is<00:02:37.120> a

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
gears a little bit here because KX is a

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.630 
gears a little bit here because KX is a
discrete<00:02:38.050> random<00:02:38.080> variable<00:02:38.860> it<00:02:39.220> measures<00:02:39.610> the

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
discrete random variable it measures the

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.580 
discrete random variable it measures the
number<00:02:40.090> of<00:02:40.180> complete<00:02:40.690> years<00:02:41.050> of<00:02:41.260> future

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
number of complete years of future

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:42.870 
number of complete years of future
lifetime<00:02:41.980> so<00:02:42.250> basically<00:02:42.640> we're<00:02:42.850> just

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
lifetime so basically we're just

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.900 
lifetime so basically we're just
chopping<00:02:43.300> off<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:43.810> decimal<00:02:44.200> of<00:02:44.380> T<00:02:45.190> X<00:02:45.340> and<00:02:45.670> that

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
chopping off the decimal of T X and that

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.870 
chopping off the decimal of T X and that
gives<00:02:45.970> us<00:02:46.360> K<00:02:46.750> X<00:02:46.930> so<00:02:47.230> because<00:02:48.130> it's<00:02:48.430> a<00:02:48.490> discrete

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
gives us K X so because it's a discrete

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.460 
gives us K X so because it's a discrete
random<00:02:48.910> variable<00:02:49.630> it<00:02:49.960> doesn't<00:02:50.320> have<00:02:50.440> a

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
random variable it doesn't have a

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.560 
random variable it doesn't have a
probability<00:02:50.980> density<00:02:51.250> function<00:02:51.850> anymore<00:02:52.060> it

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
probability density function anymore it

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.020 
probability density function anymore it
just<00:02:52.630> has<00:02:52.960> a<00:02:53.170> probability<00:02:53.710> function<00:02:54.010> so<00:02:54.940> the

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
just has a probability function so the

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.540 
just has a probability function so the
probability<00:02:55.660> of<00:02:55.690> K<00:02:56.530> X<00:02:56.560> equaling<00:02:57.190> a<00:02:57.280> certain

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
probability of K X equaling a certain

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.760 
probability of K X equaling a certain
value<00:02:57.730> K<00:02:58.120> is<00:02:58.420> just<00:02:59.200> K<00:02:59.560> deferred<00:03:00.150> 1q<00:03:01.150> X<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:02.470> we

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
value K is just K deferred 1q X and we

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.530 
value K is just K deferred 1q X and we
developed<00:03:03.130> a<00:03:03.220> couple<00:03:03.490> of<00:03:03.550> results<00:03:03.820> as<00:03:04.120> to<00:03:04.330> what

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
developed a couple of results as to what

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.200 
developed a couple of results as to what
the<00:03:05.130> cumulative<00:03:06.130> distribution<00:03:06.310> function<00:03:07.120> and

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.210 
the cumulative distribution function and

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.520 
the cumulative distribution function and
the<00:03:07.360> survival<00:03:07.810> function<00:03:07.930> are<00:03:08.230> going<00:03:08.350> to<00:03:08.410> look

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
the survival function are going to look

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.130 
the survival function are going to look
like<00:03:08.590> in<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.370> case<00:03:09.580> of<00:03:09.790> this<00:03:10.360> now<00:03:10.570> discrete

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
like in the case of this now discrete

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.890 
like in the case of this now discrete
random<00:03:11.320> variable<00:03:11.890> of<00:03:11.980> K<00:03:12.190> X<00:03:12.370> and<00:03:12.700> another<00:03:13.600> thing

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900

random variable of K X and another thing
we<00:03:13.990> can<00:03:14.110> do<00:03:14.290> of<00:03:14.410> course<00:03:14.440> is<00:03:14.800> find<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.460> mean<00:03:15.670> and

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
we can do of course is find the mean and

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.600 
we can do of course is find the mean and
variance<00:03:15.850> of<00:03:16.330> that<00:03:16.720> random<00:03:16.960> variable<00:03:17.610> the

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
variance of that random variable the

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.510 
variance of that random variable the
mean<00:03:18.820> we<00:03:19.360> call<00:03:19.600> e^x<00:03:20.080> and<00:03:20.380> that's<00:03:20.890> known<00:03:21.100> as<00:03:21.310> the

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
mean we call e^x and that's known as the

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.850 
mean we call e^x and that's known as the
Kirti<00:03:21.910> future<00:03:22.420> lifetime<00:03:22.870> and<00:03:23.260> again<00:03:23.650> that's

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
Kirti future lifetime and again that's

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.410 
Kirti future lifetime and again that's
just<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.160> average<00:03:24.580> number<00:03:24.790> of<00:03:24.910> complete

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
just the average number of complete

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.020 
just the average number of complete
years<00:03:25.720> that<00:03:26.140> a<00:03:26.410> life<00:03:26.800> age<00:03:27.040> x<00:03:27.310> is<00:03:27.550> going<00:03:27.700> to<00:03:27.880> live

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
years that a life age x is going to live

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.680 
years that a life age x is going to live
in<00:03:28.240> the<00:03:28.330> future<00:03:28.480> and<00:03:28.810> we<00:03:29.710> can<00:03:29.860> obtain<00:03:29.980> that

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
in the future and we can obtain that

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.150 
in the future and we can obtain that
using<00:03:31.690> some<00:03:31.900> summation<00:03:32.380> techniques<00:03:32.770> that

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
using some summation techniques that

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.430 
using some summation techniques that
ends<00:03:33.430> up<00:03:33.520> just<00:03:33.640> equaling<00:03:34.120> the<00:03:34.240> sum<00:03:34.480> of<00:03:34.690> K<00:03:35.200> going

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
ends up just equaling the sum of K going

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:42.330 
ends up just equaling the sum of K going
from<00:03:35.500> 1<00:03:36.040> to<00:03:36.400> infinity<00:03:36.430> of<00:03:37.030> K<00:03:38.190> px<00:03:40.230> we<00:03:41.230> get<00:03:41.500> the

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
from 1 to infinity of K px we get the

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.770 
from 1 to infinity of K px we get the
variance<00:03:42.610> as<00:03:42.790> well<00:03:42.970> we've<00:03:43.150> got<00:03:43.240> a<00:03:43.270> result<00:03:43.540> for

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
variance as well we've got a result for

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.920 
variance as well we've got a result for
that<00:03:43.810> that<00:03:44.200> is<00:03:45.040> a<00:03:45.100> nice<00:03:45.910> result<00:03:46.270> as<00:03:46.480> well<00:03:46.660> and

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
that that is a nice result as well and

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.230 
that that is a nice result as well and
then<00:03:47.650> finally<00:03:47.680> we<00:03:48.310> looked<00:03:48.340> at<00:03:48.640> the

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
then finally we looked at the

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.970 
then finally we looked at the
relationship<00:03:49.510> between<00:03:49.960> the<00:03:50.560> complete

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
relationship between the complete

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.650 
relationship between the complete
expectation<00:03:51.640> of<00:03:51.730> life<00:03:51.850> and<00:03:52.090> the<00:03:52.240> Curt<00:03:52.450> ate

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
expectation of life and the Curt ate

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.170 
expectation of life and the Curt ate
expectation<00:03:53.410> of<00:03:53.500> life<00:03:53.650> and<00:03:53.920> a<00:03:54.580> very<00:03:54.850> very<00:03:55.090> good

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
expectation of life and a very very good

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.620 
expectation of life and a very very good
approximation<00:03:55.540> is<00:03:56.260> just<00:03:56.950> that<00:03:57.130> e<00:03:57.430> circlex<00:03:58.360> is

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
approximation is just that e circlex is

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.040 
approximation is just that e circlex is
e<00:03:58.900> x<00:03:59.200> plus<00:03:59.530> 1/2<00:03:59.830> so<00:04:00.280> on<00:04:00.490> average<00:04:01.050> someone's

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
e x plus 1/2 so on average someone's

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.020 
e x plus 1/2 so on average someone's
going<00:04:02.230> to<00:04:02.290> die<00:04:02.440> halfway<00:04:03.010> through<00:04:03.220> a<00:04:03.280> year<00:04:03.550> on

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
going to die halfway through a year on

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.180 
going to die halfway through a year on
average<00:04:04.560> reasonable<00:04:05.560> assumption<00:04:05.920> to<00:04:06.010> make

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
average reasonable assumption to make

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.490 
average reasonable assumption to make
especially<00:04:06.730> at<00:04:06.790> younger<00:04:06.970> ages<00:04:07.060> and<00:04:07.570> finally

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
especially at younger ages and finally

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.780 
especially at younger ages and finally
the<00:04:08.620> last<00:04:08.830> thing<00:04:08.980> we<00:04:09.160> looked<00:04:09.310> at<00:04:09.430> this<00:04:09.550> week

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
the last thing we looked at this week

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.390 
the last thing we looked at this week
was<00:04:10.060> just<00:04:10.090> a<00:04:10.510> quick<00:04:11.020> rundown<00:04:11.290> of<00:04:11.710> some<00:04:11.800> of<00:04:12.220> the

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
was just a quick rundown of some of the

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.240 
was just a quick rundown of some of the
common<00:04:12.970> mortality<00:04:13.510> models<00:04:13.840> that<00:04:13.990> are<00:04:14.110> used<00:04:14.250> so

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
common mortality models that are used so

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.530 
common mortality models that are used so
I'm<00:04:15.550> not<00:04:15.640> going<00:04:15.790> to<00:04:15.880> list<00:04:16.030> them<00:04:16.120> all<00:04:16.330> there

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
I'm not going to list them all there

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.120 
I'm not going to list them all there
were<00:04:16.630> seven<00:04:16.960> of<00:04:17.049> them<00:04:17.200> some<00:04:17.830> of<00:04:17.920> them<00:04:18.040> were

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
were seven of them some of them were

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.770 
were seven of them some of them were
more<00:04:18.310> useful<00:04:18.489> than<00:04:18.820> others<00:04:18.910> some<00:04:19.600> of<00:04:19.690> them

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
more useful than others some of them

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.240 
more useful than others some of them
we've<00:04:19.900> already<00:04:20.080> seen<00:04:20.350> before<00:04:20.500> in<00:04:20.770> class<00:04:20.890> and

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
we've already seen before in class and

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.160 
we've already seen before in class and
some<00:04:21.549> of<00:04:21.640> them<00:04:21.760> we<00:04:21.850> will<00:04:22.030> be

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.170 
some of them we will be

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.260 
some of them we will be
seeing<00:04:22.410> a<00:04:22.530> little<00:04:22.650> bit<00:04:22.770> later<00:04:23.040> as<00:04:23.250> well<00:04:23.400> but

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
seeing a little bit later as well but

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.480 
seeing a little bit later as well but
that's<00:04:24.600> just<00:04:24.870> a<00:04:24.960> good<00:04:25.140> thing<00:04:25.500> to<00:04:25.770> take<00:04:26.040> to<00:04:26.100> keep

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
that's just a good thing to take to keep

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.890 
that's just a good thing to take to keep
in<00:04:26.610> mind<00:04:26.760> many<00:04:27.090> of<00:04:27.210> those<00:04:27.300> are<00:04:27.480> used<00:04:27.600> on<00:04:27.780> the

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
in mind many of those are used on the

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.500 
in mind many of those are used on the
exams<00:04:28.230> so<00:04:28.740> now<00:04:29.250> you<00:04:29.310> sort<00:04:29.580> of<00:04:29.640> get<00:04:30.030> an<00:04:30.150> idea<00:04:30.240> of

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
exams so now you sort of get an idea of

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.110 
exams so now you sort of get an idea of
what<00:04:31.200> types<00:04:31.950> of<00:04:32.100> mortality<00:04:32.580> models<00:04:32.880> are<00:04:33.000> out

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
what types of mortality models are out

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.150 
what types of mortality models are out
there<00:04:33.330> so<00:04:34.290> next<00:04:34.470> week<00:04:34.680> we'll<00:04:34.800> start<00:04:34.890> talking

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
there so next week we'll start talking

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.040 
there so next week we'll start talking
about<00:04:35.400> life<00:04:35.640> tables<00:04:36.090> I<00:04:36.270> hope<00:04:36.720> you<00:04:36.840> have<00:04:37.020> a

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
about life tables I hope you have a

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.460 
about life tables I hope you have a
great<00:04:37.230> weekend<00:04:37.650> and<00:04:37.770> I'll<00:04:38.010> see<00:04:38.130> you<00:04:38.220> on<00:04:38.340> Monday
