00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.509 

well<00:02:29.110> it<00:02:29.230> should<00:02:29.440> work<00:02:29.650> as<00:02:29.860> long<00:02:30.040> as<00:02:30.190> you<00:02:30.280> fit

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
well it should work as long as you fit

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.990 
well it should work as long as you fit
you<00:02:30.610> know<00:02:30.760> exactly<00:02:31.209> what<00:02:31.659> type<00:02:32.170> of<00:02:32.200> a<00:02:32.590> team<00:02:33.549> I

guess for parks just search it and it
should<00:02:37.659> work<00:02:37.690> because<00:02:38.590> I<00:02:38.769> did<00:02:38.950> that<00:02:39.069> early<00:02:39.370> I

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
should work because I did that early I

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.850 
should work because I did that early I
don't<00:02:39.519> know<00:02:39.700> why<00:02:39.849> it<00:02:40.180> didn't<00:02:40.690> do<00:02:41.200> that<00:02:41.440> I<00:02:41.680> don't
