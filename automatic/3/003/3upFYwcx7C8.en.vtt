00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.620
 This big door is the one I'm going to 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.790
 change everything that 's in black, I'm going 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.879
 to change 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:18.120
 I'll pitch the paper contact 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:01:07.509
 to change 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:01:13.810
 large small cling on the wood a 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:18.520
 aluminum ruler but it may be that you 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:23.039
 you have a screwdriver or filipe for 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:35.280
 pull the drawers out of the drawers 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:35.280
 pilot a pen and can be plastic 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:50.500
 to use a wooden surface 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:59.039
 cut the thick fabric and put this 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:02:02.170
 another sponsor on to power in a day 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:06.640
 you will loosen the screws that 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:11.920
 My case was two 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:14.080
 that I dropped 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.350
 now I'm going to drop this part of the 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:23.670
 handle are two eye bolts have a 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:27.310
 I have here and have another here 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.040
 there I marked with the ruler to 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:36.610
 stay the same distance you see 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:38.260
 You can cut that was just right and 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.030
 now comes with a stylus or with 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.380
 scissors you prefer that already have the 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.540
 mark here 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:49.000
 also in this line is my 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:51.220
 delimiter where I'll cut here the O 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.320
 cut girls is very simple me 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.900
 I put the ruler to support you and 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.150
 pass a stiletto I'm not the hubby who 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.150
 It's a lot that's a little dangerous. 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.980
 There you make sure to hold 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.320
 ruler and passes this milk 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.260
 if you are sure to make the 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:11.110
 ask for someone else the person has 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.299
 greater firmness in the hand will measure from the other 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:17.650
 side and do the same cut 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:18.820
 You 're also going to cut one 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.579
 one 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:24.310
 now you can position the wood in the 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:29.620
 half the paper you cut and you go 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:32.250
 mark with the pen the whole extension 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.680
 of the wood you're going to stick 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:38.709
 After doing this you will cut 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:43.150
 here the tip is like it was here 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:45.070
 Moorish line from the four sides will draw 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.579
 A little bit of the champion coming, we're going. 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.110
 necklace is already in the wood 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:55.520
 here I had a piece of paper where 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:58.850
 You will start gluing to wood. 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:03.970
 So you can see that I can make it easy for you there. 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.970
 will put the wood in that piece 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:10.460
 Checking always, there are girls for 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.860
 not the boys so that not an end in itself 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.890
 pasting and pulling several times 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:20.000
 so here we have to put a 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:23.690
 once there was not in the right way 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:28.340
 We wanted to go out again 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:30.560
 paper to reposition now yes 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.150
 this marking on the marking of the 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:37.310
 The little ear we made 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:39.140
 now it can be glued, we take the 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.710
 contact in the wood 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:44.420
 Can you pass it like this? 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.720
 handing out a little cloth to take the 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:51.350
 balls balls of air that can can 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.940
 form and to secure enough contact I 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.070
 I was going to pass the spatula but did not 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:59.630

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:15.680

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:25.370
 dry the wood to you can the 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:26.569
