airport so he's going to he can use his
computer<00:03:12.460> screen<00:03:12.880> to<00:03:13.210> pick<00:03:13.390> out<00:03:13.540> the<00:03:13.690> nearest

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
computer screen to pick out the nearest

airport and then he has a checklist that
he<00:03:17.080> can<00:03:17.200> go<00:03:17.350> through<00:03:18.180> so<00:03:19.180> Steve<00:03:19.710> hopefully<00:03:20.710> is

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
he can go through so Steve hopefully is

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.120 
he can go through so Steve hopefully is
picking<00:03:22.690> out<00:03:22.780> a<00:03:22.840> nearby<00:03:23.110> airport<00:03:23.440> he's<00:03:23.890> gone

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
picking out a nearby airport he's gone

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.760 
picking out a nearby airport he's gone
by<00:03:24.340> and<00:03:24.670> and<00:03:25.330> picked<00:03:25.690> that<00:03:25.870> out<00:03:25.930> so<00:03:26.590> this<00:03:26.740> is

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
by and and picked that out so this is

has no engine right now all he can do is

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.610 
has no engine right now all he can do is
steer<00:03:42.970> there's<00:03:43.210> right<00:03:43.510> that<00:03:43.840> is<00:03:43.960> now<00:03:44.140> fallen

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
outside it's moving around you students

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.480 
outside it's moving around you students
had<00:04:13.450> ever<00:04:13.600> actually<00:04:13.720> gotten<00:04:14.050> sick<00:04:14.260> before<00:04:14.500> but

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.490 
had ever actually gotten sick before but

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:16.920 
had ever actually gotten sick before but
we've<00:04:15.760> had<00:04:15.910> to<00:04:16.060> ask<00:04:16.150> students<00:04:16.600> to<00:04:16.660> step

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
we've had to ask students to step

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.470 
we've had to ask students to step
they've<00:04:17.320> asked<00:04:17.560> to<00:04:17.709> step<00:04:17.920> outside<00:04:18.190> so<00:04:19.030> Steve

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
they've asked to step outside so Steve

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.599 
they've asked to step outside so Steve
just<00:04:20.140> slipped<00:04:20.440> the<00:04:20.590> airplane<00:04:20.980> some<00:04:21.220> to<00:04:21.430> lose

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
just slipped the airplane some to lose

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.760 
just slipped the airplane some to lose
some<00:04:21.820> altitude<00:04:22.000> so<00:04:22.990> he<00:04:23.110> doesn't<00:04:23.320> overshoot

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
some altitude so he doesn't overshoot

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.560 
some altitude so he doesn't overshoot
this<00:04:23.980> Airport<00:04:24.520> what<00:04:24.940> does<00:04:25.030> it<00:04:25.090> mean<00:04:25.240> to<00:04:25.270> slip

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
this Airport what does it mean to slip

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.270 
this Airport what does it mean to slip
the<00:04:25.690> airplane<00:04:26.050> okay<00:04:26.290> what<00:04:26.530> he<00:04:26.590> does<00:04:26.770> he<00:04:26.980> brings

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
the airplane okay what he does he brings

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.280 
the airplane okay what he does he brings
a<00:04:27.460> wing<00:04:27.670> down<00:04:27.940> we're<00:04:28.270> no<00:04:28.600> longer<00:04:28.660> is<00:04:29.020> flying

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
a wing down we're no longer is flying

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.360 
a wing down we're no longer is flying
efficiently<00:04:29.980> and<00:04:30.870> the<00:04:31.890> slipstream<00:04:32.890> hits<00:04:33.220> the

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
efficiently and the slipstream hits the

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.670 
efficiently and the slipstream hits the
side<00:04:33.580> of<00:04:33.640> the<00:04:33.820> airplane<00:04:34.120> and<00:04:34.540> creates<00:04:35.470> a<00:04:35.560> lot

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
side of the airplane and creates a lot

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.310 
side of the airplane and creates a lot
of<00:04:35.740> friction<00:04:36.070> to<00:04:36.520> let<00:04:37.390> the<00:04:37.510> airplane<00:04:37.840> lose<00:04:38.110> out

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
of friction to let the airplane lose out

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.320 
of friction to let the airplane lose out
to<00:04:38.350> you<00:04:38.620> we're<00:04:39.070> creating<00:04:39.460> extra<00:04:39.730> work<00:04:40.000> where

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
to you we're creating extra work where

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.730 
to you we're creating extra work where
they<00:04:40.450> are<00:04:40.540> playing<00:04:40.810> whoa<00:04:41.020> conscious<00:04:41.590> that

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
they are playing whoa conscious that

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.190 
they are playing whoa conscious that
he's<00:04:41.890> doing<00:04:42.070> some<00:04:42.400> turns<00:04:42.700> and<00:04:43.300> he's<00:04:43.570> just<00:04:44.020> a

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
he's doing some turns and he's just a

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.110 
he's doing some turns and he's just a
maneuvers<00:04:44.710> to<00:04:44.740> lose<00:04:45.070> altitude<00:04:45.310> and<00:04:45.850> he<00:04:45.970> said

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
maneuvers to lose altitude and he said

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.110 
maneuvers to lose altitude and he said
about<00:04:46.300> a<00:04:46.360> thousand<00:04:46.900> feet<00:04:47.110> right<00:04:47.290> now<00:04:48.120> looks

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
about a thousand feet right now looks

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.760 
about a thousand feet right now looks
like<00:04:49.330> he's<00:04:49.540> at<00:04:49.690> night<00:04:49.870> yes<00:04:50.080> he's<00:04:50.590> going

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
like he's at night yes he's going

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.010 
like he's at night yes he's going
through<00:04:50.860> 900<00:04:51.520> feet<00:04:51.669> right<00:04:51.910> now<00:04:51.970> that<00:04:52.690> he<00:04:52.840> has

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
through 900 feet right now that he has

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.659 
through 900 feet right now that he has
some<00:04:53.260> help<00:04:53.500> because<00:04:53.680> the<00:04:53.980> lights<00:04:54.190> at<00:04:54.430> the<00:04:54.550> end

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
some help because the lights at the end

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.760 
some help because the lights at the end
of<00:04:54.760> the<00:04:54.850> runway<00:04:55.060> there<00:04:55.419> therefore<00:04:56.260> lights<00:04:56.560> at
