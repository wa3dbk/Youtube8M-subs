00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.259
 hello how about the project that we are going to 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:09.110
 do today are ceramic pots 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:12.920
 decorated with mandalas we are working 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:15.830
 with acrylic enamels of eternal in the 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.470
 case of the pots are pots of 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:22.720
 red clay in which we are going to give 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.720
 a white acrylic base 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:29.110
 We are going to give you two hands to increase this 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:31.990
 attitude so that it is well be well 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.600
 ready to work and once you already 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.990
 we have two acrylic-based hands 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.690
 white we grab a design in the case of 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.290
 this flowerpot I grabbed the design of these 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.579
 mandalas 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.829
 grabbed the carbon 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.840
 and once I put it down I start 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:54.140
 work with acrylic enamels 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.650
 in this case I start to outline all 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.650
 the mandalas 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.860
 I begin to outline the entire mandala 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.860
 with black acrylic enamel 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:15.500
 once I have it all outlined 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:19.060
 is a finite brush like that for the stroke 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:22.380
 be thinner but it is short hair 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.079
 once I have it delineated 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.500
 mandala I start working the fund in 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:31.979
 this case with synthetic enamel or 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.880
 celestial bay and white everything with 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.880
 loose brush strokes 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:44.500
 in this work I worked a lot with the 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.080
 acrylic enamel well watered 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.860
 so that I have the texture 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:55.620
 and with the well-marked brushstrokes 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.620
 and I'm filling all the holes 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.840
 once the whole background is going I start 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.840
 to work with colors 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.580
 I brought a piece of wood here 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.740
 but it is the same way of working the 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.240
 I brought that out so that you can see well the 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.700
 colors that I put 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:22.210
 and I start working on the case by 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.210
 example of violet seat 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.660
 at stake the brush always with little 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:33.660
 load in play the brush and with 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.660
 the water I stretch the color 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:42.209
 If so, proceed with all the colors of 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.209
 the mandala 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.690
 I'm going to make another color for example 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.280
 that 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:57.840
 the red is a red christmas i'm going 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.840
 filling the holes 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:09.590
 and so on 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.590
 I'm working with the colors 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:16.290
 in this case the mandalas are drawings 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.620
 with great you can apply great 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:22.579
 range of colors if for example in the 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.579
 green case 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:29.420
 I'm filling in, I put a little bit of 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.670
 paint in play the brush and with the 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:35.650
 same amount of water that he took out of the 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.650
 I'm going to stretch it 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.000
 once I already have all the 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:48.540
 colors placed I proceed with the enamel 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.840
 white acrylic to give a little light 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:56.540
 so that I do not have that flat color 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.540
 if in the center too 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:04.230
 and so on I'm filling everything 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.299
 the drawing this as the enamel 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.670
 white acrylics forgive the enamels 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:11.159
 acrylics have a high brightness and a 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.799
 quite great healing power this already 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:16.950
 is protected if they act as 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:19.740
 traditional glazes 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.450
 with this work with this, that is, with 

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:24.000
 These details are already finished on 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:28.160
 I hope you liked the work 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.160
 project and good and see you next
