primarily meant for bosses if you go

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.220 
primarily meant for bosses if you go
into<00:02:44.430> fights<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:45.090> you<00:02:45.150> want<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.540> take<00:02:45.720> on<00:02:45.930> ads

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
into fights and you want to take on ads

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.920 
into fights and you want to take on ads
it's<00:02:46.739> very<00:02:47.010> difficult<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.760> be<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:48.299> viable

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
it's very difficult to be a viable

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.990 
it's very difficult to be a viable
source<00:02:49.379> for<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.739> rest<00:02:49.920> of<00:02:50.010> your<00:02:50.099> team<00:02:50.459> when

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
source for the rest of your team when

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000 
source for the rest of your team when
you're<00:02:51.150> only<00:02:51.329> spitting<00:02:51.900> out<00:02:51.989> so<00:02:52.379> many<00:02:52.530> orders

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
you're only spitting out so many orders

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.910 
you're only spitting out so many orders
because<00:02:53.220> it<00:02:53.790> only<00:02:54.060> gives<00:02:54.510> you<00:02:54.720> one<00:02:55.260> shot<00:02:55.290> if

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
because it only gives you one shot if

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.270 
because it only gives you one shot if
you<00:02:56.160> have<00:02:56.549> say<00:02:57.120> for<00:02:57.150> instance<00:02:57.920> the<00:02:58.920> other<00:02:59.010> helm

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
you have say for instance the other helm

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.680 
you have say for instance the other helm
that<00:02:59.430> actually<00:02:59.760> gives<00:02:59.880> you<00:03:00.060> four<00:03:00.359> shots

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
that actually gives you four shots

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.180 
that actually gives you four shots
you're<00:03:01.139> going<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.319> course<00:03:01.530> spit<00:03:01.829> out<00:03:01.859> more

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
you're going to course spit out more

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.970 
you're going to course spit out more
orbs<00:03:02.760> so<00:03:03.120> in<00:03:03.269> that<00:03:03.420> situation<00:03:03.750> you<00:03:04.680> would<00:03:04.859> be

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
orbs so in that situation you would be

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.250 
orbs so in that situation you would be
better<00:03:05.250> fit<00:03:05.790> for<00:03:05.819> your<00:03:06.120> team<00:03:06.450> now<00:03:06.870> this<00:03:07.200> thing
