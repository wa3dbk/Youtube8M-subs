 up every night it is knows everything 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.190

 possible this family prayer which 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.080
 always turn around a pot of du 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.030
 even ritually deaths to introduce 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.400
 habits to get into 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.869
 the atmosphere we lit a candle we go out 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.299
 crosses and prayer books 

00:00:57.869 --> 00:01:05.400
 everyone settles comfortably 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:09.270
 when you entrust also wrote our 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.280
 week end the holidays a prayer that 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.860
 unfolds almost always of the same 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.259
 way to fans who do not crack after one 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:21.119
 says prayers makes us intentions 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:23.670
 of touching prayers did not kill me bah 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:31.800
 yes but in fact there is an ondama hunt 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:33.210
 in my prayers and fear forget this 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.640
 time allows to initiate sybille and 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.979
 clemency to the word of God a text 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.350
 sometimes complicated to understand when we 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.940
 is that 8 and 5 years we will be all 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.490
 Sunday morning is reading the gospel 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.620
 before mass and be the first 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.940
 reading on the second in the 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.049
 beautiful hat that is hyper town hall 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.090
 monique four juniors who is fine 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.550
 adapted there I read the gospel of the day there 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.130
 is long enough I told myself oh la la 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.370
 I have Pope as we have shown by step in 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.660
 done it's always in the moments it's 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.880
 embarrass me in addition to cutting a gospel 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.580
 so if the courses and if he is 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.430
 understandable so if we worked 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.570
 before it's a good sign 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:13.120
 but the hardest part is finding 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.070
 time every day for god between the 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.520
 parents' work and the activities of 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.710
 children 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:22.030
 the days are busy we did not 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:24.300
 not always time to pray 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.300
 true 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.970
 the best way to learn to pray 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.310
 it is to pray and therefore I really invite 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.070
 parents who can price it with 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.150
 their children on a regular basis and 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.250
 it is true that it is also in the 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.840
 practice that one learns to pray and 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.959
 then actually we can also 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.180
 sometimes explain some things but 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.190
 what seems fundamental to me is 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.810
 to live it regularity is something 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.550
 very important thing and at the same time 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.500
 which is not easy 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.840
 there are days after a day of 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.959
 work one is tired so one and then 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.220
 we feel that children are nervous 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.930
 but at the same time I think it's 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.360
 also see the family is also a 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.270
 school of prayer and I think that's 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.370
 important for the child to in his 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.459
 education precisely to have these times of 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.440
 prayer with his parents and it's small 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.930
 will also take autonomy see because 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.910
 that family prayer brings her 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.010
 also to the more personal prayer that 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.480
 lives in his room but I think 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.720
 that indeed it is like any 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.130
 reality it is educated then after 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.910
 actually there are times when that's 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.190
 more difficult 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.320
 there are times when sometimes prayer 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.750
 it can be very fast when you feel 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.130
 really that there is a difficult climate the 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.040
 same time it's important i think of 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.780
 to be able to persevere a little and at the same 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.250
 time must ever it's what I say 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.200
 often people I meet 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.690
 that they speak of their prayer life 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.410
 must never have bigger eyes 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.450
 that belly 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.690
 that is, do not be too greedy 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.459
 when for example there are parents they 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.430
 are not too motivated often these kids 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:05.560
 sailboats that claims or sometimes it's 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.049
 parents who say we are going to pray holy 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.260
 these mutuals see that goes in both 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.260
 meaning
