temp image we saw the gap between what

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.160 
temp image we saw the gap between what
was<00:00:23.880> out<00:00:23.970> there<00:00:24.150> for<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.359> cross-country<00:00:24.630> shoe

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
super stiff but also something that we

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.010 
super stiff but also something that we
can<00:00:40.440> walk<00:00:40.680> in<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:41.579> was<00:00:41.700> comfortable<00:00:42.270> we<00:00:42.840> didn't

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
can walk in it was comfortable we didn't

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.410

want<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.230> look<00:00:43.530> goofy<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:45.500> little<00:00:46.500> bit

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
want to look goofy and a little bit

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.180 
want to look goofy and a little bit
about<00:00:48.420> what's<00:00:49.050> cool<00:00:49.289> about<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.649> bottom<00:00:50.100> of

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
about what's cool about the bottom of

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.430 
about what's cool about the bottom of
this<00:00:50.280> thing<00:00:50.340> we<00:00:51.329> knew<00:00:51.480> we<00:00:51.600> wanted<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.230> start

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
this thing we knew we wanted to start

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.990 
this thing we knew we wanted to start
off<00:00:52.559> with<00:00:52.800> rubber<00:00:53.070> we<00:00:53.370> had<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.610> have<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.760> rubber

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
off with rubber we had to have a rubber

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.150 
off with rubber we had to have a rubber
outsole<00:00:54.120> gives<00:00:54.780> us<00:00:54.930> great<00:00:55.199> grip<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:55.800> we<00:00:55.890> wanted

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
outsole gives us great grip so we wanted

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.220 
outsole gives us great grip so we wanted
to<00:00:56.250> actually<00:00:56.399> put<00:00:56.789> some<00:00:57.030> pretty<00:00:57.510> grooves<00:00:57.960> in

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
to actually put some pretty grooves in

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.810 
to actually put some pretty grooves in
it<00:00:58.379> so<00:00:58.559> we<00:00:58.649> get<00:00:58.770> some<00:00:58.949> traction<00:00:59.250> going<00:00:59.430> uphill

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
it so we get some traction going uphill

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.099 
it so we get some traction going uphill
and<00:01:00.090> downhill<00:01:00.300> it's<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.660> little<00:01:00.870> bit<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.050> a

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
and downhill it's a little bit of a

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.170 
and downhill it's a little bit of a
temper<00:01:01.680> tradition<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.640> good<00:01:02.850> traction

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
temper tradition of that good traction

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.119 
temper tradition of that good traction
in<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.510> heel<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.899> toe<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.619> we<00:01:04.979> also

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
in the heel and the toe and we also

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.740 
in the heel and the toe and we also
wanted<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.489> really<00:01:05.700> reduce<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.119> amount<00:01:06.299> of

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
wanted to really reduce the amount of

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.660 
wanted to really reduce the amount of
rubber<00:01:06.960> just<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.740> keep<00:01:07.890> this<00:01:08.010> thing<00:01:08.220> as<00:01:08.340> light

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
rubber just to keep this thing as light

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.070 
rubber just to keep this thing as light
as<00:01:08.880> possible<00:01:09.420> we<00:01:09.540> all<00:01:09.659> know<00:01:09.810> you're<00:01:09.990> all

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
as possible we all know you're all

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.859 
as possible we all know you're all
sensitive<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:10.909> as<00:01:11.909> far<00:01:12.150> as<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.390> shank

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
sensitive to that as far as the shank

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.870 
sensitive to that as far as the shank
none<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.439> us<00:01:13.619> pedal<00:01:13.920> bikes<00:01:14.220> with<00:01:14.460> our<00:01:14.580> toes<00:01:14.850> and

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
none of us pedal bikes with our toes and

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.670 
none of us pedal bikes with our toes and
our<00:01:15.270> heels<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:15.869> we<00:01:16.020> really<00:01:16.259> wanted<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.560> make

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
our heels so we really wanted to make

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.590 
our heels so we really wanted to make

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
sure that it was nice and stiff in the

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.899 
sure that it was nice and stiff in the
middle<00:01:19.049> but<00:01:19.530> allowed<00:01:19.799> for<00:01:20.040> good<00:01:20.220> flexibility

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
middle but allowed for good flexibility

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.789 
middle but allowed for good flexibility
in<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.119> toe<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.509> heel<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.960> everything

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.530 
little rubber gasket underneath this
this<00:03:28.200> plate<00:03:28.799> so<00:03:29.100> all<00:03:29.609> that<00:03:29.880> water<00:03:30.120> and<00:03:30.390> debris

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
this plate so all that water and debris

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.449 
this plate so all that water and debris
just<00:03:31.019> stays<00:03:31.260> on<00:03:31.440> the<00:03:31.530> outside<00:03:31.950> so<00:03:32.190> you<00:03:32.220> never

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
just stays on the outside so you never

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:33.860 
just stays on the outside so you never
get<00:03:32.609> that<00:03:32.670> stuff<00:03:33.030> soaking<00:03:33.329> up<00:03:33.540> through<00:03:33.750> the

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
get that stuff soaking up through the

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:34.310 
get that stuff soaking up through the
bottom

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
bottom

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.949 
bottom
now<00:03:35.070> a<00:03:35.609> couple<00:03:35.790> pedal<00:03:36.180> systems<00:03:36.570> don't<00:03:36.690> allow

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
now a couple pedal systems don't allow

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:37.580 
now a couple pedal systems don't allow
for<00:03:37.019> that

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
for that

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.150 
for that
so<00:03:38.100> with<00:03:38.790> looking<00:03:39.150> time<00:03:39.420> you<00:03:40.019> can<00:03:40.200> still<00:03:40.470> mount

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
so with looking time you can still mount

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.590 
so with looking time you can still mount
the<00:03:41.430> look<00:03:41.609> in<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:41.820> time<00:03:42.030> or<00:03:42.299> the

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600
