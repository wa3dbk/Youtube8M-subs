00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.200 

if<00:01:39.290> you<00:01:39.440> go<00:01:39.650> too<00:01:39.710> far<00:01:40.100> out<00:01:40.250> just<00:01:40.670> take<00:01:40.790> a<00:01:40.820> q-tip

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
and clean it up it's easy to do because

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.460 
and clean it up it's easy to do because
we<00:01:47.390> are<00:01:47.420> actually<00:01:47.750> chopping<00:01:48.380> off<00:01:50.110> the<00:01:51.110> end<00:01:51.290> of

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
we are actually chopping off the end of

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:58.180 
we are actually chopping off the end of
our<00:01:51.530> own<00:01:51.740> brow<00:01:52.070> and<00:01:52.490> shortening<00:01:53.479> it<00:01:56.890> so<00:01:57.890> a<00:01:57.920> few

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
our own brow and shortening it so a few

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.230 
our own brow and shortening it so a few
tips<00:01:58.369> the<00:01:58.520> easiest<00:01:58.940> way<00:01:59.060> to<00:01:59.090> fix<00:01:59.390> that

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.630 

and<00:02:03.870> we're<00:02:04.229> just<00:02:04.440> working<00:02:04.680> our<00:02:04.950> way<00:02:04.979> up<00:02:05.130> from

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
and we're just working our way up from

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:12.890 
and we're just working our way up from
the<00:02:06.090> outside<00:02:06.590> corner<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.799> our<00:02:08.399> eye<00:02:11.870> and<00:02:12.870> just

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
the outside corner of our eye and just

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.630 
the outside corner of our eye and just
kind<00:02:13.530> of<00:02:13.620> blending<00:02:14.100> out<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.250> edges<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:17.430> best

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
kind of blending out the edges the best

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:31.160 
kind of blending out the edges the best
way<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:17.819> do<00:02:18.060> that<00:02:18.209> is<00:02:18.390> with<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.660> finger

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.280 

so<00:02:31.740> now<00:02:31.920> that<00:02:31.980> we<00:02:32.280> have<00:02:32.520> created<00:02:32.819> our<00:02:33.360> I<00:02:33.390> with

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
so now that we have created our I with

fill with the white so basically where

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.980 
fill with the white so basically where
we<00:02:40.260> have<00:02:40.380> all<00:02:40.530> this<00:02:40.680> skin<00:02:41.010> we<00:02:41.730> are<00:02:41.880> just<00:02:42.240> going

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
we have all this skin we are just going

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.600 

and<00:02:54.990> now<00:02:55.260> we're<00:02:55.590> going<00:02:55.800> to<00:02:55.890> take<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.400> white

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
and now we're going to take the white

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.140 
and now we're going to take the white
and<00:02:56.880> just<00:02:56.910> go<00:02:57.270> over<00:02:57.300> the<00:02:57.690> eyebrow<00:02:59.060> kind<00:03:00.060> of

just give it that appearance that I got

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.240 
just give it that appearance that I got
chopped<00:03:02.790> off<00:03:03.080> and<00:03:04.080> then<00:03:04.380> just<00:03:04.650> fill<00:03:04.950> in<00:03:05.160> the

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
chopped off and then just fill in the

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.210 
chopped off and then just fill in the
middle<00:03:05.610> of<00:03:05.910> where<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.270> black<00:03:06.510> is<00:03:06.980> and<00:03:07.980> just

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
middle of where the black is and just

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:14.380 
middle of where the black is and just
scoop<00:03:08.700> it<00:03:08.790> up

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.420 

of<00:03:14.960> course<00:03:15.230> we<00:03:15.410> can<00:03:15.560> bring<00:03:15.800> the<00:03:15.920> black<00:03:16.130> down<00:03:16.370> a

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
of course we can bring the black down a

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.680 
of course we can bring the black down a
little<00:03:16.760> more<00:03:17.030> and<00:03:19.060> really<00:03:20.060> just<00:03:20.210> marry<00:03:20.600> the

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
little more and really just marry the

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.550 
little more and really just marry the
two<00:03:20.960> colors<00:03:21.350> together<00:03:21.590> so<00:03:23.170> we<00:03:24.170> get<00:03:24.320> a<00:03:24.350> little

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
two colors together so we get a little

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.500 
two colors together so we get a little
bit<00:03:24.770> of<00:03:24.860> a<00:03:24.950> gray<00:03:25.250> effect<00:03:25.640> in<00:03:25.820> there<00:03:26.000> as<00:03:26.120> well

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.790 

and<00:03:29.510> then<00:03:29.810> we're<00:03:29.960> gonna<00:03:30.110> go<00:03:30.350> to<00:03:30.410> the<00:03:30.680> other
