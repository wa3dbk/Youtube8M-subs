00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.700
 hi dear viewers this is a series 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.620
 fence installation 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:13.110
 from a to i and at this stage we see that 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:16.460
 I have already installed all the pillars and if 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:20.750
 you look then you will see how much 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:23.220
 they all stand straight and straight 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.910
 all this was done thanks to this one 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.970
 the string that I now swing in front of 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.279
 yours on your monitors 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:36.690
 that's it for me I was guided 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.280
 and exhibited and got here such 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.090
 excellent result 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:50.219
 really excellent and deserves 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:55.260
 I think respect so this country was 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:59.820
 stretched from one corner post to 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:03.660
 friend friend criminal post and on 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.030
 something with the help of cargo is not easy 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.010
 bolted precisely stretched by 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:15.299
 cargo and here is such a result 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:20.509
 look from this post that's what 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.509
 it turns out like this 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:30.270
 no pillar anywhere protrudes everything in 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.610
 overall wonderful many commit 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.149
 big mistake 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:38.090
 pulling this string down the bottom and but sort of 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:41.220
 somehow think it 's easier to start 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.860
 dig well actually this 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.789
 a big mistake to pull the string 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.460
 better on top though in general 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:53.940
 it seems a little harder but really 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.539
 makes it much easier to work like you 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.990
 you see 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:59.850
 the subject is simplified by what has become 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.500
 I would have turned out perfectly 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.390
 even all on the same level 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:12.870
 accordingly i don't need to spend 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:15.810
 time to reconcile these pillars and on so 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.459
 say the installation process is easier in 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.180
 installing pillars easier to navigate 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:23.970
 on the occasion of this string rather than measure from 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.920
 bottom so to speak with the help of the level 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.850
 it is not known what will actually happen 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.340
 on to string easier to navigate 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:36.570
 I therefore recommend that you use 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:41.519
 string on top and in general now 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:44.970
 it's time to shoot this country for 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:51.370
 this i will go to the opposite side 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:54.459
 and show you the game with the help of which 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.739
 fixed this string will now start itself 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:01.690
 play bark dog for sure 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:08.310
 Neighborhood well I will try to show you and 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:11.590
 you look also mean both 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.129
 the last pillar is our string and 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.690
 using these children bricks 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:20.230
 stretched this string now i 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.560
 quietly let's turn off the camera of course 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.940
 but explain what I do means and 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.720
 gradually brick by brick 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.420
 I will remove all these bricks and weaken 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:35.829
 string 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:39.299
 weaken the string and here you are kind 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.299
 from this side 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:48.709
 here's how you see all the columns 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:52.340
 on the same level and here is the straightness 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:55.609
 these mean pillars on this side 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.450
 but the result is the same here and so 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:01.659
 if you look 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:05.420
 principle we see the same thing and it means 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:07.579
 big means the advantage of what 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.519
 would you not be on par 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:12.859
 I will be allowed to install later 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:17.440
 guides like here if you look at 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:21.199
 the fence that was made by me too 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.810
 we see guides as they are very 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:25.910
 nice rovnenko look the same 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.250
 here will be fixed guide and 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.599
 here and they will be the same way 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.599
 look beautiful 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.430
 Well, as long as it was all a series of installation 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.250
 fence from a to z 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.940
 with you was pashkin frezer in continuation 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.260
 follows 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.260
 goodbye
