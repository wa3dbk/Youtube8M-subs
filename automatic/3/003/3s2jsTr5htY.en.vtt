00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
I feel like this would look good with

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.550 
I feel like this would look good with
just<00:04:04.850> some<00:04:05.090> like<00:04:05.270> distressed<00:04:05.750> jeans<00:04:06.260> and

maybe like converse okay at forever 21 I

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.070 
maybe like converse okay at forever 21 I
picked<00:04:09.769> up<00:04:09.950> two<00:04:10.400> things<00:04:10.760> and<00:04:11.150> this<00:04:11.660> looks

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
picked up two things and this looks

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.500 
picked up two things and this looks
really<00:04:12.350> similar<00:04:12.680> to<00:04:12.860> the<00:04:13.040> flannel<00:04:13.459> I<00:04:13.610> got<00:04:13.820> but

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
really similar to the flannel I got but

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.030 
really similar to the flannel I got but
it's<00:04:14.720> this<00:04:15.050> long<00:04:15.590> flannel<00:04:16.630> t-shirt<00:04:17.630> dress

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
it's this long flannel t-shirt dress

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.190 
it's this long flannel t-shirt dress
this<00:04:19.040> print<00:04:19.400> is<00:04:19.609> lighter<00:04:20.060> than<00:04:20.479> the<00:04:20.750> other<00:04:20.930> one

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
this print is lighter than the other one

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.840 
this print is lighter than the other one
and<00:04:21.470> there's<00:04:21.680> less<00:04:22.100> red

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
and there's less red

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.320 
and there's less red
so<00:04:23.420> there's<00:04:23.930> my<00:04:24.110> justification<00:04:25.150> but<00:04:26.150> it's

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
so there's my justification but it's

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.700 
so there's my justification but it's
just<00:04:26.540> this<00:04:26.690> long<00:04:26.990> flannel<00:04:28.600> dress<00:04:29.600> and<00:04:30.050> it<00:04:30.500> also
