 members of the local council of veterans 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.989

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.329
 may indicate a specific person but 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.129
 veterans say that Maslov is this one 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.840
 elegant man he is present 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.969
 almost every solemn 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.960
 event went to school talking about 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.059
 protection of the fatherland 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.160
 although almost the entire war went on 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.180
 side of the nazis served in punitive 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.969
 detachment in Belarus 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.930
 these troops destroyed nearly 3 million 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.940
 a man was talking about the war he 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:07.260
 told all this a terrible thing and so 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:11.790
 further on personally sean was somewhere 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:14.430

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.159
 Verdun and camp worked for the Germans 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.869

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.840

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.000

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.210

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.090
 participation in the Moscow battle which 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.310
 went just in time 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.470
 Germany in 2007 one of the veterans 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.510
 wrote in the paper that the oil in 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.400

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.110
 veteran was not believed and publicly 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.780

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.190
 the prosecutor's office of the Moscow region contacted 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.280
 with the prosecutor's office of Belarus and everything came together 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.110

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.680
