00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.240 
your bike which is very critical because
most<00:04:05.230> of<00:04:05.320> the<00:04:05.410> batteries<00:04:05.710> are<00:04:05.830> right<00:04:06.070> at<00:04:06.190> the

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
most of the batteries are right at the

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.920 
most of the batteries are right at the
top<00:04:06.400> of<00:04:06.460> the<00:04:06.640> chassis<00:04:06.850> which<00:04:07.480> is<00:04:07.600> why<00:04:07.720> this<00:04:07.780> is

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
top of the chassis which is why this is

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.350 
top of the chassis which is why this is
so<00:04:08.140> important<00:04:08.530> for<00:04:08.590> the<00:04:08.680> handling<00:04:09.070> and<00:04:09.360> just

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
so important for the handling and just

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.000 
so important for the handling and just
the<00:04:10.540> all<00:04:10.990> the<00:04:11.140> characteristics<00:04:11.500> bought<00:04:11.920> the

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
the all the characteristics bought the

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.250 
the all the characteristics bought the
bike<00:04:12.190> making<00:04:12.520> it<00:04:12.640> react<00:04:13.240> plug<00:04:13.510> quicker<00:04:13.720> so<00:04:14.020> all

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
bike making it react plug quicker so all

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.199 
bike making it react plug quicker so all
the<00:04:14.470> off-road<00:04:14.890> racers<00:04:15.280> that<00:04:15.490> have<00:04:15.670> East<00:04:16.000> our

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
the off-road racers that have East our

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.640 
the off-road racers that have East our
bikes<00:04:16.420> will<00:04:17.020> put<00:04:17.290> in<00:04:17.380> the<00:04:17.470> lightweight

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
bikes will put in the lightweight

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.020 
bikes will put in the lightweight
lithium<00:04:18.100> batteries<00:04:18.370> especially<00:04:18.790> the<00:04:18.850> Moto

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
lithium batteries especially the Moto

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.699 
lithium batteries especially the Moto
bikes<00:04:19.270> that<00:04:19.390> have<00:04:19.450> got<00:04:19.660> that<00:04:19.810> some<00:04:20.380> will<00:04:20.500> run

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
bikes that have got that some will run

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.140 
bikes that have got that some will run
even<00:04:21.010> smaller<00:04:21.280> battery<00:04:21.670> which<00:04:21.790> will<00:04:21.940> give<00:04:22.090> you

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
even smaller battery which will give you

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.940 
even smaller battery which will give you
a<00:04:22.210> few<00:04:22.420> quick<00:04:22.630> starts<00:04:22.960> right<00:04:23.140> in<00:04:23.230> a<00:04:23.260> row<00:04:23.380> which

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
a few quick starts right in a row which

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.230 
a few quick starts right in a row which
should<00:04:24.100> take<00:04:24.220> about<00:04:24.280> four<00:04:24.730> pounds<00:04:24.880> off<00:04:25.120> the

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
should take about four pounds off the

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.730 
should take about four pounds off the
lights<00:04:25.420> so<00:04:25.540> that<00:04:25.810> that's<00:04:26.020> really<00:04:26.380> a<00:04:26.410> benefit

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
lights so that that's really a benefit

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.470 
lights so that that's really a benefit

some of the UTV guys like that big

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.220 
some of the UTV guys like that big
battery<00:04:36.250> for<00:04:36.490> extra<00:04:37.060> capacity<00:04:37.180> for<00:04:37.780> lights<00:04:37.990> or

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
battery for extra capacity for lights or

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.940 
battery for extra capacity for lights or
sound<00:04:38.830> systems<00:04:39.220> what<00:04:39.370> I<00:04:39.400> really<00:04:39.580> wanted

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
sound systems what I really wanted

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.740 
sound systems what I really wanted
and<00:04:40.250> those<00:04:40.610> units<00:04:40.940> would<00:04:41.030> take<00:04:41.210> eight<00:04:41.420> to<00:04:41.450> ten

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
and those units would take eight to ten

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.990 
and those units would take eight to ten
pounds<00:04:42.050> off<00:04:42.170> me<00:04:42.320> so<00:04:43.130> it's<00:04:43.730> just<00:04:43.820> a<00:04:43.970> really

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
pounds off me so it's just a really

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.730 
pounds off me so it's just a really
really<00:04:44.450> great<00:04:44.630> product<00:04:45.140> the<00:04:45.410> lithium

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
really great product the lithium

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.170 
really great product the lithium
technology<00:04:45.890> is<00:04:46.370> going<00:04:46.520> to<00:04:46.580> just<00:04:47.030> keep

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
technology is going to just keep

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.580 
technology is going to just keep
advancing<00:04:47.360> and<00:04:47.870> just<00:04:47.990> taking<00:04:48.230> more<00:04:48.410> weight

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
advancing and just taking more weight

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.130 
advancing and just taking more weight
adding<00:04:49.430> more<00:04:49.550> power<00:04:49.790> to<00:04:50.090> the<00:04:50.210> the<00:04:50.690> starting<00:04:51.050> of

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.140 
adding more power to the the starting of

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.870 
adding more power to the the starting of
the<00:04:51.170> bikes<00:04:51.380> and<00:04:51.560> it<00:04:52.100> fires<00:04:52.310> them<00:04:52.490> off<00:04:52.610> a<00:04:52.640> lot

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
the bikes and it fires them off a lot

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:53.920 
the bikes and it fires them off a lot
quicker<00:04:53.030> so<00:04:53.270> that's<00:04:53.420> even<00:04:53.630> better<00:04:53.720> when

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
quicker so that's even better when

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.060 
quicker so that's even better when
you've<00:04:54.050> got<00:04:54.110> a<00:04:54.170> dent<00:04:54.440> engine<00:04:54.650> start<00:04:54.920> like<00:04:55.040> a

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
you've got a dent engine start like a

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.030 
you've got a dent engine start like a
GNCC<00:04:55.520> so<00:04:56.360> pretty<00:04:56.810> much<00:04:56.900> all<00:04:57.170> the<00:04:57.350> all<00:04:57.590> the<00:04:57.620> GNCC
