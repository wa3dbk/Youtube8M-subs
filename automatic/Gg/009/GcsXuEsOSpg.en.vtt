00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
other bands that weren't really making

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.500 
other bands that weren't really making
us<00:01:16.070> all<00:01:16.190> that<00:01:16.370> happy<00:01:16.729> I<00:01:16.909> mean<00:01:17.150> we<00:01:17.390> were<00:01:17.450> just

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
us all that happy I mean we were just

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.670 
us all that happy I mean we were just
kind<00:01:17.780> of<00:01:17.870> going<00:01:18.140> through<00:01:18.200> the<00:01:18.350> motions<00:01:18.620> with

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
kind of going through the motions with

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.039

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
them we didn't see them going very far

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.170 
them we didn't see them going very far
so<00:01:21.979> we<00:01:22.070> really<00:01:22.250> get<00:01:22.369> why<00:01:22.580> the<00:01:22.640> hell<00:01:22.760> not<00:01:22.909> why

all<00:01:29.120> of<00:01:29.570> the<00:01:29.690> experimental<00:01:30.350> stuff<00:01:30.560> that<00:01:30.740> we

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
all of the experimental stuff that we

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.190 
all of the experimental stuff that we
think<00:01:32.000> about<00:01:32.120> doing<00:01:32.360> our<00:01:32.570> regular<00:01:32.690> bands<00:01:33.110> that

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
think about doing our regular bands that

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.380 
think about doing our regular bands that
we<00:01:33.290> can't<00:01:33.560> do<00:01:33.770> due<00:01:34.250> to<00:01:34.370> creative<00:01:34.640> you<00:01:35.360> know

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
it's a that's the simplest answer I can

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.380 
it's a that's the simplest answer I can
give<00:01:54.230> you<00:01:54.320> the<00:01:54.470> metal<00:01:54.680> never<00:01:54.860> ended<00:01:55.220> as<00:01:55.390> it

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
give you the metal never ended as it

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.510 
give you the metal never ended as it
evolved<00:01:57.080> and<00:01:57.290> this<00:01:57.500> is<00:01:57.650> just<00:01:57.860> one<00:01:58.400> little

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
evolved and this is just one little

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.150 
evolved and this is just one little
branch<00:01:58.820> on<00:01:59.090> that<00:01:59.240> tree<00:01:59.510> and<00:01:59.690> and<00:02:00.500> on<00:02:00.920> top<00:02:01.130> of

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
branch on that tree and and on top of

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.450 
branch on that tree and and on top of
that<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.490> bands<00:02:01.760> that<00:02:01.910> do<00:02:02.740> even<00:02:03.740> recognize

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
that the bands that do even recognize

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.490 
that the bands that do even recognize
themselves<00:02:04.700> as<00:02:04.970> a<00:02:05.030> post<00:02:05.270> metal<00:02:05.540> band<00:02:05.720> we<00:02:05.990> feel

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
themselves as a post metal band we feel

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.080 
themselves as a post metal band we feel
very<00:02:06.530> little<00:02:06.980> in<00:02:07.070> common<00:02:07.250> with<00:02:07.490> with<00:02:07.850> bands

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
very little in common with with bands

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.020 
very little in common with with bands
like<00:02:08.209> that<00:02:08.450> we<00:02:09.229> really<00:02:09.459> so<00:02:10.459> we<00:02:10.580> really<00:02:10.789> do<00:02:10.879> try

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
bands that try to follow your footsteps

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.710 
bands that try to follow your footsteps
what<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.650> key<00:02:35.610> in<00:02:35.790> my<00:02:35.970> opinion<00:02:36.360> is<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.570> fact

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
what the key in my opinion is the fact

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.200 
what the key in my opinion is the fact
that<00:02:36.750> we<00:02:36.930> don't<00:02:37.080> tour<00:02:37.850> nine<00:02:38.850> months<00:02:39.090> out<00:02:39.150> of

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
that we don't tour nine months out of

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.710 
that we don't tour nine months out of
the<00:02:39.360> year

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
the year

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.570 
the year
in<00:02:40.200> fact<00:02:40.500> we<00:02:40.620> just<00:02:40.650> do<00:02:40.890> these<00:02:41.040> six<00:02:41.310> months

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
in fact we just do these six months

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.510 
in fact we just do these six months
stretches<00:02:42.050> I'm<00:02:43.050> excuse<00:02:43.320> me<00:02:43.440> six<00:02:43.650> weeks<00:02:43.830> we

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
stretches I'm excuse me six weeks we

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.890 
stretches I'm excuse me six weeks we
just<00:02:44.700> do<00:02:44.790> six<00:02:45.030> weeks<00:02:45.210> stretches<00:02:45.600> and<00:02:45.780> that's

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
just do six weeks stretches and that's

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.530 
just do six weeks stretches and that's
really<00:02:46.020> the<00:02:46.200> key<00:02:46.410> is<00:02:46.620> that<00:02:46.680> during<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:48.210> year

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
really the key is that during the year

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.290 
really the key is that during the year
we'll<00:02:48.780> do<00:02:48.930> weekend's<00:02:49.560> throughout<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.670> fall

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
we'll do weekend's throughout the fall

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.330 
we'll do weekend's throughout the fall
and<00:02:51.330> spring<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:52.170> then<00:02:52.620> in<00:02:52.800> the<00:02:52.890> summer<00:02:53.100> time

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
and spring and then in the summer time

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.830 
and spring and then in the summer time
is<00:02:53.640> when<00:02:53.850> we'll<00:02:53.970> hit<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.180> road<00:02:54.210> really<00:02:54.540> hard

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
is when we'll hit the road really hard

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.570 
is when we'll hit the road really hard
whether<00:02:55.200> we're<00:02:55.500> in<00:02:55.530> Europe<00:02:55.950> whether<00:02:56.310> we're<00:02:56.550> in

Australia or the United States at that

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.430 
Australia or the United States at that
moment<00:03:00.120> when<00:03:00.510> we're<00:03:00.660> on<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.870> road<00:03:01.020> for<00:03:01.290> six

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
moment when we're on the road for six

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.740 
moment when we're on the road for six
weeks<00:03:01.680> it<00:03:02.340> can<00:03:02.490> be<00:03:02.610> a<00:03:02.640> little<00:03:02.970> it<00:03:03.510> can<00:03:03.660> be

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
weeks it can be a little it can be

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.900
