the answer down start problems or

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.130 
the answer down start problems or
approximations<00:00:26.420> so<00:00:27.420> I'm<00:00:27.539> gonna<00:00:27.689> go<00:00:27.869> over<00:00:27.960> the

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
approximations so I'm gonna go over the

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.019 
approximations so I'm gonna go over the
first<00:00:28.439> few<00:00:28.650> here<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.160> I'm<00:00:29.550> going<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.730> enlarge

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
first few here and I'm going to enlarge

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.049 
first few here and I'm going to enlarge
this<00:00:30.510> so<00:00:31.380> we<00:00:31.500> can<00:00:31.650> have<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.859> better<00:00:32.099> view<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.790> the

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
this so we can have a better view of the

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.549 
this so we can have a better view of the
problems<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:33.840> we're<00:00:33.960> going<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.170> take<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.350> look

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
problems that we're going to take a look

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:44.930 
problems that we're going to take a look
at<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.840> number<00:00:36.840> one<00:00:37.260> is<00:00:39.800> 2012<00:00:41.090> plus<00:00:42.590> 2013<00:00:43.940> well

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
at and number one is 2012 plus 2013 well

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.319 
at and number one is 2012 plus 2013 well
2000<00:00:45.719> plus<00:00:45.960> 2000<00:00:46.739> that's<00:00:47.160> going<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.399> be<00:00:47.489> 4000

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
2000 plus 2000 that's going to be 4000

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.540 
2000 plus 2000 that's going to be 4000
so<00:00:49.110> I'm<00:00:49.200> going<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.350> have<00:00:49.500> four<00:00:49.800> thousand<00:00:50.399> and

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
so I'm going to have four thousand and

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.540 
so I'm going to have four thousand and
twelve<00:00:50.850> plus<00:00:51.149> thirteen<00:00:51.719> that's<00:00:52.320> 25

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
twelve plus thirteen that's 25

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.020 
twelve plus thirteen that's 25
that's<00:00:54.030> four<00:00:54.239> thousand<00:00:54.719> 25<00:00:55.579> the<00:00:56.579> next<00:00:56.610> one<00:00:56.940> I'm

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
that's four thousand 25 the next one I'm

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.639 
that's four thousand 25 the next one I'm
gonna<00:00:57.210> multiply<00:00:57.300> two<00:00:57.570> thousand<00:00:58.109> twelve<00:00:58.320> times

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
gonna multiply two thousand twelve times

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.580 
gonna multiply two thousand twelve times
six<00:00:58.980> I<00:00:59.250> can<00:00:59.370> do<00:00:59.489> 12<00:00:59.760> times<00:00:59.969> 6<00:01:00.300> that's<00:01:00.420> 72<00:01:00.989> and

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
six I can do 12 times 6 that's 72 and

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.850 
six I can do 12 times 6 that's 72 and
then<00:01:02.309> 0<00:01:02.609> times<00:01:02.910> 6<00:01:03.120> that's<00:01:03.300> 0<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.019> 2<00:01:04.170> times<00:01:04.470> 6<00:01:04.710> is

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
then 0 times 6 that's 0 and 2 times 6 is

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.190 
then 0 times 6 that's 0 and 2 times 6 is
12

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
12

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.890 
12
number<00:01:07.200> 3<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.970> 2100<00:01:08.970> 2<00:01:09.210> minus<00:01:09.920> 2012<00:01:11.479> mm<00:01:12.479> cancel

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
number 3 is 2100 2 minus 2012 mm cancel

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.060 
number 3 is 2100 2 minus 2012 mm cancel
out<00:01:13.049> so<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:13.439> have<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.740> hundred<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.310> 2<00:01:14.490> minus<00:01:14.970> 12

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
out so I have a hundred and 2 minus 12

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.190 
out so I have a hundred and 2 minus 12
that's<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.189> same<00:01:17.430> as<00:01:17.580> saying<00:01:17.729> 100<00:01:18.299> minus<00:01:18.780> 10

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
that's the same as saying 100 minus 10

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.330 
that's the same as saying 100 minus 10
that's<00:01:19.799> 90<00:01:21.259> number<00:01:22.259> four<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.740> two<00:01:22.920> thousand

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
that's 90 number four is two thousand

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.940 
that's 90 number four is two thousand
twelve<00:01:23.549> divided<00:01:23.939> by<00:01:24.030> five<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.439> answer<00:01:25.860> is

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
twelve divided by five and the answer is

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.840 
twelve divided by five and the answer is
required<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.580> be<00:01:26.729> as<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.299> decimal<00:01:27.900> so<00:01:28.759> what<00:01:29.759> I'm

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
required to be as a decimal so what I'm

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.819 
required to be as a decimal so what I'm
gonna<00:01:29.939> do<00:01:30.150> is<00:01:30.299> I'm<00:01:30.479> gonna<00:01:30.799> double<00:01:31.799> the

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
gonna do is I'm gonna double the

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.100 
gonna do is I'm gonna double the
numerator<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.670> denominator<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:33.420> if<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.780> double

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
numerator and denominator so if I double

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.890 
numerator and denominator so if I double
that<00:01:34.140> I'm<00:01:34.380> gonna<00:01:34.470> have<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.740> divisor<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.310> ten

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
that I'm gonna have a divisor of ten

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.140 
that I'm gonna have a divisor of ten
twenty<00:01:36.900> twelve<00:01:37.470> times<00:01:37.920> two<00:01:38.220> that's<00:01:38.460> forty

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
twenty twelve times two that's forty

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.429 
twenty twelve times two that's forty
twenty<00:01:39.780> four<00:01:40.520> and<00:01:41.520> when<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.450> divide<00:01:42.659> by<00:01:43.049> 10

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
twenty four and when I divide by 10

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.730 
twenty four and when I divide by 10
that's<00:01:43.680> four<00:01:44.070> Oh<00:01:44.100> two<00:01:44.399> point<00:01:44.729> four<00:01:45.530> three<00:01:46.530> and

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
that's four Oh two point four three and

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.490 
that's four Oh two point four three and
four<00:01:46.950> fifths<00:01:47.189> that's<00:01:47.520> three<00:01:47.729> point<00:01:48.030> eight<00:01:48.180> as

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
four fifths that's three point eight as

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.620 
four fifths that's three point eight as
a<00:01:49.500> percent<00:01:50.070> multiplied<00:01:50.820> by<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.060> hundred<00:01:51.149> that's

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
a percent multiplied by a hundred that's

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.679 
a percent multiplied by a hundred that's
three<00:01:51.840> hundred<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.290> eighty<00:01:53.149> percent<00:01:54.149> three

memorize your squares for a number since

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.459 
memorize your squares for a number since
otherwise<00:02:03.630> you're<00:02:03.840> gonna<00:02:03.930> wind<00:02:04.170> up<00:02:04.290> working

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
otherwise you're gonna wind up working

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.749 
otherwise you're gonna wind up working
those<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.009> it's<00:02:05.100> going<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.310> take<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.520> lot<00:02:05.729> of

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
those and it's going to take a lot of

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.540 
those and it's going to take a lot of
time<00:02:06.090> one<00:02:06.960> in<00:02:07.110> three<00:02:07.350> fifths<00:02:07.770> plus<00:02:08.009> two<00:02:08.429> and

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
time one in three fifths plus two and

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.720 
time one in three fifths plus two and
three<00:02:08.789> quarters<00:02:09.209> as<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.810> mixed<00:02:10.319> number<00:02:10.379> so<00:02:10.860> I'm

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
three quarters as a mixed number so I'm

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.180 
three quarters as a mixed number so I'm
going<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:11.910> add<00:02:12.060> three<00:02:12.480> fifths<00:02:12.959> plus<00:02:13.170> three

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
going to add three fifths plus three

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.320 
going to add three fifths plus three
and<00:02:14.550> if<00:02:15.360> I<00:02:15.690> do<00:02:15.750> a<00:02:16.170> cross<00:02:16.830> product<00:02:17.190> here<00:02:17.550> 4<00:02:17.970> times

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
and if I do a cross product here 4 times

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.190 
and if I do a cross product here 4 times
3<00:02:18.690> that's<00:02:18.720> 12<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.880> 5<00:02:20.880> times<00:02:21.150> 3<00:02:21.390> that's<00:02:21.420> 15<00:02:22.050> I'm

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
3 that's 12 and 5 times 3 that's 15 I'm

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.820 
3 that's 12 and 5 times 3 that's 15 I'm
gonna<00:02:22.320> add<00:02:22.470> 12<00:02:22.800> plus<00:02:23.130> 15<00:02:23.400> I<00:02:23.760> have<00:02:23.850> 27<00:02:24.570> over<00:02:25.260> 20

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
gonna add 12 plus 15 I have 27 over 20

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:26.960 
gonna add 12 plus 15 I have 27 over 20
my<00:02:25.980> denomination<00:02:26.460> 20

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
my denomination 20

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.560 
my denomination 20
so<00:02:27.510> I'll<00:02:27.630> write<00:02:27.780> 7<00:02:28.260> over<00:02:28.440> 20<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:28.980> carry<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.370> 1<00:02:29.670> 1

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
so I'll write 7 over 20 and carry a 1 1

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.680 
so I'll write 7 over 20 and carry a 1 1
2<00:02:30.900> plus<00:02:31.710> the<00:02:31.890> one<00:02:32.100> that's<00:02:32.370> gonna<00:02:32.490> be<00:02:32.640> 4<00:02:32.940> 4<00:02:33.360> &amp;<00:02:33.510> 7

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
2 plus the one that's gonna be 4 4 &amp; 7

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.270 
2 plus the one that's gonna be 4 4 &amp; 7
points

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
points

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.400 
points
number<00:02:35.970> 8<00:02:36.590> you<00:02:37.590> have<00:02:37.890> 20<00:02:38.460> times<00:02:38.700> 12<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.450> 20

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
number 8 you have 20 times 12 and 20

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.860 
number 8 you have 20 times 12 and 20
times<00:02:40.590> 13<00:02:41.220> you<00:02:41.370> could<00:02:41.520> factor<00:02:41.790> out<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.060> 20<00:02:42.570> so<00:02:42.780> if

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
times 13 you could factor out a 20 so if

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.260 
times 13 you could factor out a 20 so if
I<00:02:43.020> was<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.230> factor<00:02:43.620> out<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.770> 20<00:02:44.130> mentally<00:02:44.610> you

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
I was to factor out the 20 mentally you

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.790 
I was to factor out the 20 mentally you
would<00:02:45.390> have<00:02:45.570> 12<00:02:45.900> plus<00:02:46.260> 13<00:02:47.240> 25<00:02:48.240> times<00:02:48.600> 20<00:02:49.080> if<00:02:49.590> I

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
would have 12 plus 13 25 times 20 if I

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.490 
would have 12 plus 13 25 times 20 if I
take<00:02:50.040> 1/4<00:02:50.700> of<00:02:50.880> 20<00:02:51.240> that's<00:02:51.390> 5<00:02:51.720> that's<00:02:52.110> an<00:02:52.260> even

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
take 1/4 of 20 that's 5 that's an even

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.360 
take 1/4 of 20 that's 5 that's an even

500 every time you'll fly by 25 25 is

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.890 
500 every time you'll fly by 25 25 is

the quarter that's 5 over 4 and if I

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
take reciprocal of that point 8 I just

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.260 
take reciprocal of that point 8 I just
want<00:03:16.470> to<00:03:16.560> play<00:03:16.620> that<00:03:16.890> times<00:03:17.130> point<00:03:17.520> 8<00:03:17.670> so<00:03:17.970> 8

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
want to play that times point 8 so 8

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.150 
want to play that times point 8 so 8
times<00:03:18.600> 6<00:03:18.990> is<00:03:19.200> 48<00:03:19.890> carry<00:03:20.610> a<00:03:20.730> 4<00:03:21.060> and<00:03:21.390> then<00:03:22.100> 8<00:03:23.100> times

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
times 6 is 48 carry a 4 and then 8 times

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.880 
times 6 is 48 carry a 4 and then 8 times
5<00:03:23.910> is<00:03:23.970> 40<00:03:24.330> plus<00:03:24.990> the<00:03:25.320> 4<00:03:25.530> that's<00:03:25.830> 4<00:03:26.570> 48<00:03:27.570> and<00:03:28.080> my

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
5 is 40 plus the 4 that's 4 48 and my

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.610 
5 is 40 plus the 4 that's 4 48 and my
dad<00:03:29.100> someone<00:03:29.430> goes<00:03:29.790> right<00:03:30.060> there<00:03:30.380> number<00:03:31.380> 10

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
dad someone goes right there number 10

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.370 
dad someone goes right there number 10
is<00:03:31.740> an<00:03:31.860> approximation<00:03:32.550> and<00:03:33.000> on<00:03:33.960> this<00:03:34.170> one

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
is an approximation and on this one

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.650 
is an approximation and on this one
we're<00:03:34.530> going<00:03:34.650> to<00:03:34.710> have<00:03:36.830> 2128<00:03:37.880> so<00:03:38.880> I<00:03:38.940> have<00:03:39.270> 20

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
we're going to have 2128 so I have 20

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.680 
we're going to have 2128 so I have 20
100<00:03:40.170> minus<00:03:40.560> 10<00:03:40.770> hundred<00:03:41.070> that's<00:03:41.190> 1100<00:03:42.090> plus

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
100 minus 10 hundred that's 1100 plus

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.110 
100 minus 10 hundred that's 1100 plus
another<00:03:42.960> hundred<00:03:43.260> I'm<00:03:43.590> gonna<00:03:43.770> have<00:03:44.120> 436

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
another hundred I'm gonna have 436

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.390 
another hundred I'm gonna have 436
that's<00:03:45.480> an<00:03:45.630> approximation<00:03:45.900> and<00:03:46.680> that's<00:03:47.160> well

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
that's an approximation and that's well

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.850 
that's an approximation and that's well
within<00:03:47.580> the<00:03:47.820> range<00:03:48.090> so<00:03:49.020> we'll<00:03:49.200> pause<00:03:49.440> it<00:03:49.710> right

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
within the range so we'll pause it right

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.310 
within the range so we'll pause it right
here
