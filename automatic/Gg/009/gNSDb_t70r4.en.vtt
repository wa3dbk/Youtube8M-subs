00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.760
 how about friends of your gameplay andrew 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.250
 Welcome again to this your channel 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.120
 thank you very much for following us 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.860
 thank you very much that is that they have 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.419
 subscribed and those who are not subscribed 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.759
 Well, I invite you to subscribe 

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:22.519
 to this channel and good this time 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:26.140
 we bring what is a super cool texture 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:29.570
 for what is our pocket edition 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.480
 that would have a texture as well as type 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.500
 silent hill 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.990
 excellent for all those who like 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.940
 of good terror because it would be very good 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.380
 so they will create their maps and well 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.240
 let's see for example here we have 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.090
 let's enter the texture map as 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.650
 can see appear like this and we're going to 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.020
 start here I have my legion of 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:51.170
 guardians let's make day so that 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:54.080
 can see all the icons and all the 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:57.950
 items so they can see how it is 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:00.290
 move and how is it that they have their interface 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:03.790
 each one of them will be able to see for example 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.790
 let's start from here 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.030
 here they are from the woods and all 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.850
 all the cubes for example the pumpkin 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.840
 It makes me very cool we can see that 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.090
 he has a smiling face here 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.440
 excellent for our mods since 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.470
 some of us on our maps 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.600
 when you love having those who 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.790
 We like good horror as something 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.979
 similar with what you can give us a little 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.720
 of fear and good for example well here 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:36.090
 they are all all 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.369
 the blocks 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.490
 some that I assure you for example all 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.219
 most plants have bug 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.619
 As you can see, they look almost black 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:48.929
 all good if not all 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.079
 two are fine but well there in 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.670
 outside everything else is normal by 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.140
 example let's see here the crystal 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.070
 I also loved it very much 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:03.010
 transparent in almost lines the bars 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.440
 here we can see the trees and also 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:08.470
 we have the crystals as you can see 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.840
 here the two doors are very 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.480
 well as I tell you already when you enter 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.610
 you ' good map because it will look very good 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.100
 here we have the villagers can 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.560
 see the cows as if they were 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.180
 skulls skeletons the chickens by 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.340
 I do not know what you are seeing here 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.200
 of metiche has wanted to eat my 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:31.110
 chick holes 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.860
 you can see them here because the good side 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.490
 we have the sheep and we will see what 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.930
 what are the 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.810
 the spaces that are 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.269
 the bats I say to me I loved it 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.970
 this texture to make some map of 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.790
 terror 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:55.060
 look at the bats they look very, very 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.060
 ok here we have the squids 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.040
 here we have the 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.110
 the trails 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.530
 something like that silent hill style and with the 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.150
 head of the triangle these that are that 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.319
 they are golden weight I do not know what they are but 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.480
 they are very nice 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.269
 and I loved the clipper can see it 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.859
 you I think playing in the night 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:21.860
 and so in the dark with tenuous music 7 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:23.690
 it is with its tone 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.060
 if you see one out there in the 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.550
 night here, well, there are the wolves 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.850
 You can see what they bring but it seems that 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:34.160
 they bring earphones and here 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.690
 and the domesticated as I say, look 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.480
 in the head of the triangle in the 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.390
 skeletons looks very good good similar 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.530
 to clover because everything here is Cuban 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:47.650
 Men also look very good 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:51.280
 here we can see the spiders I missed 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.650
 the day iu spiders the sands of 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.230
 day the test spiders but good 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.800
 they are very good there, we can see 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:02.620
 the cubes lemon and we have later to 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.260
 the cubes that we did not see them I think if it's not 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.500
 that have already left 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.810
 they left but well let's put the 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.460
 active marm 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:16.090
 let's look 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:20.200
 and we can see that it has very good for 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:22.870
 our terror maps seems to me very 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:26.260
 very well I loved here all my 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:29.320
 puppies guarding the place 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:33.160
 and let's try it inside a map 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:35.440
 so that you see more or less the 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.690
 credits will appear in the description 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.630
 of the video so you can see and 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:43.380
 You can see here how beautiful it looks 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.380
 for example 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:52.690
 to go to the mental hospital of a gamer 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:57.400
 Well, it also has its channel 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:59.850
 very good to have in the pictures the 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.850
 zombies 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.510
 we can go looking good with music 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:07.590
 as I tell them all the environment because it 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.590
 I would see very well 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:17.620
 the beds also have nothing but good 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:20.940
 I hope that later they will improve 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.940
 let's see here 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.930
 the very old booksellers look very 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:27.830
 all right 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.830
 the spiderlings 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:33.729
 scripps I tell you that if you were consulted or 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.500
 be that it appears this dark and in 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:38.319
 the night and nothing else suddenly between 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:41.139
 dark and dim and opening the Bogota 

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:43.949
 positive with your thrones 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:43.949
 here 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:52.259
 can you see how all this is that these 

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:55.860
 blocks I think are the blocks of 

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:55.860
 Obsidian I think they are 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:01.420
 there the ropes as I say they look 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:04.870
 very very well this I think it also has 

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:07.849
 a small long level let's move it to 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:11.419
 survival mode 

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:13.789
 I do not have the thought I see a line 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:15.860
 black but the posters are also seen 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:19.099
 very very well for those I tell you 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:21.919

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:25.009
 island or we will love this this 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:26.899
