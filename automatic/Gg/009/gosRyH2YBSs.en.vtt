00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.340
 So the dice friends dog is released 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.990
 I want to do it all day again 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.429
 shortly after , nothing else 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.440

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.420

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.279
 been for a few dog tags but me 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.770
 Of course, I'm not even a rudimentary 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.840
 just remotely so important or something 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.060
 interesting as the first 20 guys 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.310
 Now here once by the coveted dog 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.869
 have received tags so warm 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.550
 do not even welcome the video as an extra 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.140
 not at all not a bit at all 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.219
 some way together because 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.600
 You 've heard it, I'm still in it 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.710
 already said the last videos I am 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.600
 still on the way 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.120
 for nvidia and you can of course me 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.820
 still meet every day on the 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.800
 corresponding locations or in the 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.140
 corresponding atelco stores information about it 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.430
 you will find in our corresponding 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.989
 trailer and height pretty sure that 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.180
 I also have one or the other blog 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.750
 so have uploaded so cordial 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.399
 congratulation 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.379
 First of all, all those who came by 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.170
 are and of course now in london all 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.440
 yes users who have made it now 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.210
 very first dyson friends dog tags too 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.189
 get link to that you'll find below in 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.990
 the description is the link to the me 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.930
 Now say English original source 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.390
 and it shows which of the user 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.400
 now, first of all, get the whole 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.030
 and how am i supposed to do that? 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.850
 saying 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.439
 Personally, I think that's really nice 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.939
 there is now in this case again 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.290
 Has also decided a few trends 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.640
 dog tags rauszugeben 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.960
 I expected it to be one 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.250
 So it's a little earlier 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.420
 a little faster then we are 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.820
 let's be honest now they are already 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.650
 all official dlc released 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.909
 been so from the beginning about the 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.409
 has been spoken and mine 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.759
 personal tip would have been that 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.500
 somehow in the middle of the year already the 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.000
 of the dog tag area as hewn out 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.729
 but of course, they have been completely 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.470
 clear the geis so see now had very 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.850
 very much to do with battlefield 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.829
 4 again in the right light too 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.960
 and I can do that accordingly 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.850
 also understand that something like the 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.680
 frendzy dog ​​tags first behind 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.960
 I will not be scheduled now 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.909
 read all the people in the list with 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.930
 there are only a few in it with me 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.520
 either my own 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.100
 maybe I've had some experience 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.380
 me in 100 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.780
 also met or user me so 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.430
 already on the way 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.350
 First and foremost I would like to talk about six now 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.360
 very good talks will not cracks 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.190
 Yes, he should really have something in there 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.520
 Battlefield missed English speaking 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.310
 yes youtuber the extreme in the eastereggs 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.470
 search yes is captured with or with 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.300
 's inside and the tracks are videos 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.770
 simply a unique feature 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.630
 what the man does you can just him 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.700
 Watch and listen for half an hour 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.230
 it's just always a new one 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.940
 happening I believe it is one 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.260
 British pretty sure beat me 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.519
 not if that is wrong he is so much 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.560
 been traveling the world now 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.420
 this year too for battlefield that 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.550
 I'm not sure anymore 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.750
 So this is the channel from Jack Blacks 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.130
 you would have to find all by yourself 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.390
 otherwise there is my youtube 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.850
 search and even if that is complete 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.440
 Wrong writes her room find the 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.519
 circle I met or 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.650
 shaking hands with a few words 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:53.500
 when I moved to America 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.720
 have been invited by and that is 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.370
 really always the one from my point of view 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.140
 it has stayed on the ground too 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.850
 It is called although he call extremely high 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.769
 pay has extremely successful channel 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.660
 just another absolutely cool sow 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.790
 so thumbs up is still high for tech 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.280
 Freaks at this point then the user 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.769
 number two of the ndr got is 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.540
 a german colleague april so when 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.820
 Apple is the account of him that is 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.380
 the user of the battlefield 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.230
 pages not last hosted 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.519
 battlefield 4 sex.com site where ever 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.200
 again some very interesting ones 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.320
 Get information on the daylight 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.790
 for example, that a user has 666 kills 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.980
 for example, by hand torch or 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.450
 was that was that the flatrate was me 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.980
 did not know and did not 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.090
 Such things you can of course on 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.519
 best meeting if you want the sign 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.900
 clearly has to stop there, of course 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.340
 also to come on so who of you 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.840
 you should not know that yet 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.760
 once the site visit you once 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.320
 as register and from the time is 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.470
 then and I even believe retroactively 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.549
 then your sz on the website 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.950
 then also tracked and 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.720
 Accordingly determined apple was too 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.829
 I now tell me about responsible 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.470
 We also have a plug in for 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:04:00.010
 provided as we like a yes 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.510
 ip dog tag took place event 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.680
 has been a bit longer and 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.160
 have him live again afterwards 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.980
 met neil last on one 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.630
 yes I think I think that was me 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.530
 I quite sure where exactly but now 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.570
 that was definitely one too 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.220
 event also have him 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.170
 Of course we met as well 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.880
 flew together to the states 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.200
 because he is also at that time 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.250
 hardliner event on the besides me 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.230
 I have been invited 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.850
 having been at the start so battlefield 4 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.480
 stats there definitely come 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.220
 look at 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.990
 anyone who is looking for stents or anything 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.790
 going beyond battlefield is interested 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.500
 is definitely in good hands 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.180
 then the user is not the third 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.000
 want to introduce or want to show is 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.920
 the floppy director of power with distance 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.080
 the hottest fenway trailers the man 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.290
 can imagine for battlefield 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.490
 Everybody should understand you 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.350
 the so a little deeper in the 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.610
 Matter in there is not quite sure 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.350
 now comes from new zealand or 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.270
 Australia not my from New Zealand 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.850
 certainly very far down 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.260
 under and he makes the extremely hottest 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.790
 fans trailer and always has 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.840
 problems with the copyrights was then 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.370
 but again somehow a schnitzel with 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.180
 rim is he not allowed to use 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:04.620
 and so on last at the trailer too 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.450
 that was the final stand 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.520
 really nice colleague was on the 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:10.110
 america also meet with it totally 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.720
 of course it radiates because he believes me 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.610
 a journey of 29 hours and so on had 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.980
 but still extremely cool 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.870
 then a user or a user 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.210
 who is also very active on twitter 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.830

 to bring to battlefield generally and 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.900

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.060
