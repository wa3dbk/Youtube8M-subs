it<00:01:33.180> with<00:01:33.210> equal<00:01:33.750> parts<00:01:33.930> shampoo<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.189> AJAX<00:01:36.110> so

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
it with equal parts shampoo and AJAX so

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.580 
it with equal parts shampoo and AJAX so
I<00:01:37.140> can<00:01:37.619> get<00:01:37.770> like<00:01:37.950> max

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
I can get like max

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.940 
I can get like max
left<00:01:39.780> okay<00:01:40.780> so<00:01:40.840> this<00:01:41.109> is<00:01:41.320> what<00:01:41.469> it<00:01:41.560> looks<00:01:41.740> like

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
left okay so this is what it looks like

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.429 
left okay so this is what it looks like
and<00:01:42.219> makes<00:01:42.609> it<00:01:42.789> out<00:01:42.939> of<00:01:42.969> a<00:01:43.149> should<00:01:43.390> be<00:01:43.539> probably

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
and makes it out of a should be probably

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:46.740 
and makes it out of a should be probably
pretty<00:01:44.679> frothy<00:01:45.369> all<00:01:45.969> right<00:01:46.090> so<00:01:46.270> once<00:01:46.479> it<00:01:46.600> looks

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
pretty frothy all right so once it looks

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.020 
pretty frothy all right so once it looks
like<00:01:47.020> this<00:01:47.259> just<00:01:47.950> put<00:01:48.130> it<00:01:48.250> through<00:01:48.609> your<00:01:48.789> hair

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
going to come out this time it might

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.050 
going to come out this time it might
even<00:02:30.959> take<00:02:31.290> somewhere<00:02:32.130> close<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:32.370> 10<00:02:32.760> times

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
which I would recommend doing over a

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.979 
which I would recommend doing over a
matter<00:02:35.160> of<00:02:35.310> days<00:02:35.580> your<00:02:36.030> shower<00:02:36.330> cap<00:02:36.720> that

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
matter of days your shower cap that

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.830 
matter of days your shower cap that
works<00:02:37.200> but<00:02:37.470> since<00:02:37.739> I<00:02:37.860> do<00:02:37.920> this<00:02:38.190> so<00:02:38.519> often<00:02:38.790> I<00:02:39.239> I

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
works but since I do this so often I I

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.530 
works but since I do this so often I I
would<00:02:40.230> go<00:02:40.319> broke<00:02:40.560> for<00:02:40.860> buying<00:02:41.069> shower<00:02:41.370> caps<00:02:41.730> so

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.379 
going to do and I almost never do it
just<00:03:36.930> because<00:03:37.109> I<00:03:37.319> usually<00:03:37.639> go<00:03:38.639> a<00:03:38.670> color<00:03:39.090> that

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
just because I usually go a color that

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:43.270 
just because I usually go a color that
is<00:03:39.540> really<00:03:39.840> close<00:03:40.139> in<00:03:40.560> this<00:03:40.829> case<00:03:41.069> I'm<00:03:41.370> going

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
is really close in this case I'm going

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.810 
is really close in this case I'm going
this<00:03:43.430> light<00:03:43.850> blue<00:03:44.120> is<00:03:44.450> called<00:03:45.220> observe<00:03:46.220> that

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
should cover this and the light purple

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.890 
should cover this and the light purple
stains<00:03:49.760> so<00:03:50.570> this<00:03:51.170> is<00:03:51.650> one<00:03:52.460> of<00:03:52.490> my<00:03:52.700> VP<00:03:53.240> fashion

hair extensions that are already dyed
and<00:03:56.210> being<00:03:56.540> processed<00:03:56.810> but<00:03:57.620> it's<00:03:57.950> about<00:03:58.250> the

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
and being processed but it's about the

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.990 
and being processed but it's about the
same<00:03:58.970> color<00:03:59.709> at<00:04:00.709> least<00:04:00.950> the<00:04:01.100> same<00:04:01.310> depth<00:04:01.700> of
