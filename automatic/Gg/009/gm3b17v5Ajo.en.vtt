question okay so the first thing I'm
going<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.730> discuss<00:00:18.029> is<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:19.880> improvisation

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
going to discuss is the improvisation

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.120 
going to discuss is the improvisation
and<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.180> scale<00:00:21.510> are<00:00:21.689> used<00:00:21.869> for<00:00:22.050> 99%<00:00:22.890> of<00:00:22.920> what<00:00:23.070> I

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
and the scale are used for 99% of what I

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.210 
and the scale are used for 99% of what I
do<00:00:23.189> so<00:00:23.970> learn<00:00:24.539> this<00:00:24.750> pattern<00:00:25.109> over<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.070> next

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
do so learn this pattern over the next

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.939 
do so learn this pattern over the next
series<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.939> small<00:00:27.539> instructional<00:00:28.410> videos<00:00:28.710> you

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
series of small instructional videos you

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.169 
series of small instructional videos you
will<00:00:29.010> sort<00:00:29.220> of<00:00:29.279> understand<00:00:29.640> how<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.970> use<00:00:30.150> it

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
will sort of understand how to use it

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.350 
will sort of understand how to use it
more<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.510> what<00:00:30.660> keys<00:00:30.900> they<00:00:31.080> are<00:00:31.260> but<00:00:32.009> first

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
more and what keys they are but first

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:53.689 
more and what keys they are but first
learn<00:00:33.360> this<00:00:33.540> pattern<00:00:52.250> if<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.370> learn<00:00:53.520> that

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
learn this pattern if you learn that

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.260 
learn this pattern if you learn that
shape<00:00:54.800> memorize<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:56.070> their<00:00:56.640> pattern<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.149> it

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
shape memorize that their pattern of it

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.279 
shape memorize that their pattern of it
that's<00:00:57.600> what<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:57.809> always<00:00:57.930> do

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
that's what I always do

fourth finger same again the next one on
the<00:01:17.040> D<00:01:17.189> string<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.580> just<00:01:17.759> 12<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.090> 14<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:19.159> next

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
the D string is just 12 to 14 the next

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.240 
the D string is just 12 to 14 the next
one<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.909> actually<00:01:21.000> go<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.990> 11th<00:01:22.290> fret<00:01:22.439> 11

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
one you actually go to the 11th fret 11

one you actually go to the 11th fret 11
12<00:01:23.700> 14<00:01:24.650> and<00:01:25.650> then<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:25.920> go<00:01:26.040> 12<00:01:26.430> 13<00:01:27.119> 14<00:01:28.520> because

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
12 14 and then you go 12 13 14 because

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.640 
12 14 and then you go 12 13 14 because
last<00:01:30.119> string<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.570> also<00:01:30.720> eats<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.229> same<00:01:31.409> as<00:01:31.560> the
