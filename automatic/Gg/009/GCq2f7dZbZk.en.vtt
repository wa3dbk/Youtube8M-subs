00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
locations quite quickly and I don't

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.700 
locations quite quickly and I don't
always<00:00:31.279> have<00:00:31.520> the<00:00:31.610> time<00:00:31.820> to<00:00:32.029> set<00:00:32.239> my<00:00:32.450> camera<00:00:32.710> so

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.370 
always have the time to set my camera so
this<00:00:34.579> is<00:00:34.700> basically<00:00:34.970> putting<00:00:35.300> using<00:00:35.930> manual

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
this is basically putting using manual

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.709 
this is basically putting using manual
mode<00:00:36.559> or<00:00:36.890> aperture<00:00:37.610> priority<00:00:37.910> but<00:00:38.270> making<00:00:38.600> it

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
mode or aperture priority but making it

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.470 
mode or aperture priority but making it
much<00:00:39.140> more<00:00:39.430> automatic<00:00:40.430> except<00:00:41.210> for<00:00:41.360> it's

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
much more automatic except for it's

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.180 
much more automatic except for it's
controlled<00:00:42.110> so<00:00:42.440> you've<00:00:42.590> got<00:00:42.770> still<00:00:43.010> full

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
controlled so you've got still full

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.430

I'm just going to drop that down to law

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:13.990 
I'm just going to drop that down to law
now<00:01:09.259> we'll<00:01:09.439> switch<00:01:10.329> that<00:01:11.329> on<00:01:12.520> now<00:01:13.520> I've<00:01:13.820> got

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
now we'll switch that on now I've got

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.270 
now we'll switch that on now I've got
maximum<00:01:14.630> set<00:01:14.960> at<00:01:15.140> three<00:01:15.530> thousand<00:01:15.979> ten<00:01:16.100> which

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
maximum set at three thousand ten which

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.550 
maximum set at three thousand ten which
is<00:01:16.340> quite<00:01:16.579> high<00:01:16.790> for<00:01:16.820> this<00:01:17.270> camera<00:01:17.630> so<00:01:18.469> I'm

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
is quite high for this camera so I'm

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.580 
is quite high for this camera so I'm
going<00:01:18.679> to<00:01:18.740> drop<00:01:18.829> that<00:01:18.889> down<00:01:19.039> to<00:01:19.420> 1600<00:01:20.420> and<00:01:20.659> then

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
going to drop that down to 1600 and then

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.760 
going to drop that down to 1600 and then
there's<00:01:21.920> a<00:01:22.009> minimum<00:01:22.310> shutter<00:01:22.639> speed<00:01:23.499> now<00:01:24.499> this

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
there's a minimum shutter speed now this

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.099 
there's a minimum shutter speed now this
obstacle<00:01:25.280> depend<00:01:25.850> on<00:01:25.999> what<00:01:26.149> lens<00:01:26.569> you've<00:01:26.840> got

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:27.109 
obstacle depend on what lens you've got

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:30.370 
obstacle depend on what lens you've got
on<00:01:27.259> the<00:01:27.380> camera<00:01:27.770> at<00:01:27.889> the<00:01:27.979> time<00:01:28.249> and<00:01:28.719> I'm<00:01:29.719> going

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
on the camera at the time and I'm going

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.660 
on the camera at the time and I'm going
to<00:01:30.469> assume<00:01:30.859> I've<00:01:31.130> got<00:01:31.369> my<00:01:31.990> 28<00:01:32.990> 270<00:01:33.829> in<00:01:34.039> which

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
to assume I've got my 28 270 in which

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.349 
to assume I've got my 28 270 in which
case<00:01:34.999> I<00:01:35.270> can<00:01:35.389> set<00:01:35.749> this<00:01:35.959> to<00:01:36.369> 1/8<00:01:37.369> teeth<00:01:37.939> of<00:01:38.240> a

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:38.359 
case I can set this to 1/8 teeth of a

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:42.849 
case I can set this to 1/8 teeth of a
second<00:01:38.810> and<00:01:40.030> that's<00:01:41.030> it<00:01:41.359> done<00:01:41.569> so<00:01:42.529> what<00:01:42.679> that<00:01:42.799> I

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:42.859 
second and that's it done so what that I

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:44.169 
second and that's it done so what that I
mean<00:01:43.100> now<00:01:43.249> when<00:01:43.429> I<00:01:43.490> go<00:01:43.639> to<00:01:43.759> start<00:01:43.999> taking

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:44.179 
mean now when I go to start taking

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:47.050 
mean now when I go to start taking
photos<00:01:44.539> in<00:01:45.079> aperture<00:01:45.380> mode<00:01:45.799> the<00:01:46.609> cameras

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
photos in aperture mode the cameras

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.550 
photos in aperture mode the cameras
going<00:01:47.209> to<00:01:47.329> choose<00:01:47.689> the<00:01:48.319> best<00:01:48.560> options<00:01:51.700> m4i<00:01:52.700> so

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
going to choose the best options m4i so

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.139 
going to choose the best options m4i so
depending<00:01:54.560> on<00:01:54.649> the<00:01:55.009> settings<00:01:55.520> I'm<00:01:55.639> using<00:01:55.909> on

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
depending on the settings I'm using on

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.469 
depending on the settings I'm using on
the<00:01:56.240> camera<00:01:57.130> so<00:01:58.130> if<00:01:58.490> you've<00:01:58.849> got<00:01:59.029> a<00:01:59.060> Nikon

the camera so if you've got a Nikon

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.209 
the camera so if you've got a Nikon
give<00:01:59.869> it<00:01:59.959> a<00:01:59.990> try<00:02:00.139> I'm<00:02:00.319> not<00:02:00.560> sure<00:02:00.799> about<00:02:00.950> other

will because a very good thing to to use
and<00:02:10.369> put<00:02:10.490> into<00:02:10.610> practice<00:02:10.990> and<00:02:11.990> I'll<00:02:12.319> do<00:02:12.650> a

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
and put into practice and I'll do a

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.960 
and put into practice and I'll do a

video review or tutorial later on where
I<00:02:17.000> show<00:02:17.270> me<00:02:17.569> putting<00:02:17.930> that<00:02:18.020> into<00:02:18.170> action<00:02:18.740> and

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
I show me putting that into action and

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.550 
I show me putting that into action and
also<00:02:19.700> using<00:02:20.060> a<00:02:20.090> speed<00:02:20.390> light<00:02:20.630> for<00:02:21.049> bouncing
