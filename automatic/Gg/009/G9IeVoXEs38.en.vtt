 we are in valls in tarragona and we said 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.729
 that we were going to do calçot because 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.570
 we are precisely in the cradle of 

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:49.430
 scaffold 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.189
 mercedes in the area known here as 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.110
 'the cam with whom we cook 

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:55.280
 make up the kitchen with our 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.989
 friend antón good afternoon to all the 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.519
 good afternoon that at the moment we are going to 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.350
 start by explaining what are the calçots 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:01.850
 Mercedes sure knows it but there will be 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.710
 many people who do not know him 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.390
 it's an onion exactly the case that 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.400
 it's an onion we could say it 's from 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.040
 the 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.520
 the grandson of the pearl is first planted 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.190
 the seed then once I was fat I was 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.550
 take part in half you plant another 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.590
 time and what comes out is an outbreak of the 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.940
 onion now we will apply how they are made 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.710
 we leave it here for the moment 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.650
 we should take grilled but 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.570
 let's focus on the antón sauce that 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.370
 what we have done is to grilled 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.740
 also tomato and garlic 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.590
 first we put tomatoes and 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.290
 grilled garlic then we launch and 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.960
 once it's done then we have to 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.390
 move to prepare the garlic sauce 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.369
 we have to leave long because if not the 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.380
 skin is in the sauce not and the 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.660
 tomato also all this you have to put it 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.940
 in the mortar with a hazelnut almonds 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.710
 result after cleaning everything well 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.660
 how do you say a little trick so that 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.369
 know how strong is this we start to 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.220
 work in the big mountain very well 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:02.990
 Well, first we take 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.620
 the hazelnut 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.600
 almond 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.270
 and all this we are crushing everything 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.160
 well crushing this does not need to 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.260
 patience if it takes your time takes your 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.350
 time you have to ensure that it is fine 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.870
 no if not then you find the increases and 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.850
 the whole hazelnut and not not suitable 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.010
 not because it is convenient that we have everything 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.050
 well crushed once we have all this 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.350
 well crushed you have to add the 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.450
 tomato and garlic that we have gone through 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.760
 elaboration the one that we have is already taken out 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.010
 mind the garlic so it is not so strong 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.770
 there are people who like that is from the 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:42.160
 stronger sauce and then add you 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.710
 add a clove of raw garlic 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:49.240
 this is not the case with us now 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:51.220
 we put the roasted tomato and the garlic 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.750
 and you this sauce in quantities 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.760
 industrial because here they come to eat 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.490
 every day more and a half ago a thousand 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:01.590
 people every day but the ends of 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:04.330
 week yes and more and more 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.170
 we have added the tomato nuts 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.750
 toasted 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.310
 we are crushing we are crushing here 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.690
 that has an ingredient with would be two 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.430
 then we would throw what is the 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.500
 help that I have here in the pulp 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.630
 prepared and a little chilli 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.550
 taste of each one titled the flesh of 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.980
 the refrigerator with the chilli pepper exactly 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.980
 all this here well fine chopped 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:30.890
 and we have to be very fine very thin 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:34.650
 we are cooking but we remember that 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:37.810
 we have to study well crushed there 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:40.209
 to go through the next phase 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.739
 the next phase which antón we are going to 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.020
 teach how it has to be what we 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.060
 would be like that and makes me forward 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.800
 following dishes that we are going to 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.599
 cook the vitaly stew itself that's 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.030
 beef stew and a tasty 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:54.500
 lobster can not only see ahead with 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.420
 snails 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.210
 Here we put some pepper to 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:02.000
 taste of each one a little bit of paprika 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.530
 this sweet sweet case 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.600
 that we like it spicy as well 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.600
 we can spice but good and 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.720
 we take the pepper we put a little 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.590
 of salt and crush antonia march 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.090
 We review all the ingredients for 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.269
 that nobody miss us at home first 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:20.959
 and the almond almonds hazelnuts garlic 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:25.310
 tomato then help the chilli salt 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:28.340
 paprika pepper and I am doll 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.610
 what is missing the doll then come 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.500
 we throw in there 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.440
 the vinegar with a splash of vinegar 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:39.950
 I also like each one 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.780
 and then we are throwing oil 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.620
 and black and finally oil of 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.620
 exactly and then 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.180
 to get a sauce to our 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:54.320
 excited taste then we tried it on 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:57.080
 taste if it's good salt 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.820
 we are adding oil is necessary 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.770
 great look at home because I 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.470
 I want you to see the whole process the sauce 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.390
 we would have finished it but I want 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.100
 that you look at those cases that the 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:11.400
 we have right here once they have 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.510
 gone through the grill how they eat what 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.280
 first antonio you put a bib 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:18.660
 exactly the first thing that there is that 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:22.320
 to do is to see how I have left 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:28.020
 this movement tightens 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:29.820
 not so silly super the wood 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.890
 important because we left and what 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.930
 we clean to see how we get anything 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.950
 we take the pants and what to do 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.950
 is to catch the central leaves 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:47.050
 we get everything burned and we have the 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:47.050
 clean trousers to dip it in the sauce 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:59.020
 with the help of a little bread we 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:06:01.360
 we approach the mouth with care 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:04.650
 and there I go merced 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:08.289
 and be careful that you will not be able to speak 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:10.030
 after testing this case with a 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:12.219
 rich sauce with nuts with 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:14.229
 tomato with crying in order that quiet 

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:16.360
 roberto that I can continue 

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:18.129
 speaking we remember what we are going to do in 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.280
 just two minutes a stew of 

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:20.280
 meat
