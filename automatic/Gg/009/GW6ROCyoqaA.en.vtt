that<00:02:04.200> when<00:02:04.350> they're<00:02:04.530> in<00:02:04.619> micro<00:02:05.070> trauma<00:02:05.430> after

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
that when they're in micro trauma after

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.440 
that when they're in micro trauma after
your<00:02:06.210> training<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:07.469> can<00:02:07.979> actually<00:02:08.450> rebuild

your training you can actually rebuild

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.839 
your training you can actually rebuild
the<00:02:09.569> cells<00:02:09.899> in<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.979> right<00:02:11.160> way<00:02:11.370> by<00:02:11.580> taking

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
the cells in the right way by taking

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.160 
the cells in the right way by taking
this<00:02:12.239> supplement

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
this supplement

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.680
