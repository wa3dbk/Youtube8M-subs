00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.510 

here<00:02:59.020> we<00:02:59.170> see<00:02:59.350> a<00:02:59.380> shaft<00:02:59.680> that's<00:03:00.010> been<00:03:00.280> milled

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
here we see a shaft that's been milled

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.790 
here we see a shaft that's been milled
and<00:03:00.670> drilled<00:03:00.940> compared<00:03:01.900> with<00:03:02.050> one<00:03:02.260> yet<00:03:02.650> to

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
and drilled compared with one yet to

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.030 
and drilled compared with one yet to
undergo<00:03:03.160> the<00:03:03.280> process

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.050 

next<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.310> shaft<00:03:08.579> gets<00:03:08.849> a<00:03:08.939> protective<00:03:09.420> coating

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
next the shaft gets a protective coating

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.429 
next the shaft gets a protective coating
then<00:03:12.060> it's<00:03:12.239> time<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:12.629> bring<00:03:12.780> all<00:03:13.049> the<00:03:13.200> pieces

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:13.439 
then it's time to bring all the pieces

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:16.610 
then it's time to bring all the pieces
of<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.769> ice<00:03:13.889> axe<00:03:14.219> together<00:03:14.670> a<00:03:15.200> worker<00:03:16.200> applies

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
of the ice axe together a worker applies

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.830 
of the ice axe together a worker applies
epoxy<00:03:16.829> to<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:17.489> inside<00:03:17.939> of<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.180> rubber<00:03:18.389> handle

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210 
little more epoxy onto it and then

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:38.590 
little more epoxy onto it and then

plunging it into a snowy slope will help
the<00:03:48.920> climber<00:03:49.190> maintain<00:03:49.700> balance

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400

climbers<00:04:05.379> use<00:04:05.410> the<00:04:05.769> ads<00:04:05.950> to<00:04:06.430> chop<00:04:06.670> steps<00:04:07.060> in

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
climbers use the ads to chop steps in

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:15.259 
climbers use the ads to chop steps in
hard<00:04:07.629> snow<00:04:07.810> and<00:04:08.140> ice
