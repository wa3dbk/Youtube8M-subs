00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.210
 today I bring you a bread that is recorded 

00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:08.250
 take away any fear that you have the 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.070
 qualifying because with this without a prescription 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.230
 baquedano is a bread of 10 representation 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.879
 great and flavor is surmountable and not 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.740
 will sink or nothing is always left 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:19.439
 perfect so the next thing is that 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.420
 let's use they'll be hundred 700 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.000
 milliliters of water 100 milliliters of 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.339
 milk 3 tablespoons of oil about 15 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.130
 milliliters 300 grams of flour 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:32.070
 breadmaking force 200 grams of 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.200
 wholemeal flour about 3 grams of salt 6 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.470
 grams of sugar and one envelope of yeast 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.940
 baker's first thing we'll do as 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.340
 they always take out our bucket so as not to 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.190
 stain the resistance and we will adjust 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.810
 the blades 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.820
 first we throw the water leaving a 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.070
 little reserved for then do not go to 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.200
 be that we do not want so much need 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.090
 mass though I tell you that this amount is 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.980
 with all this water 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.020
 we throw our milk and then the oil 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.010
 great clark flours we will extend a 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.589
 bit 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.650
 then we will explore better 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:07.229
 over the sesame seeds and then 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.149
 we will put our pixar in a corner 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.850
 add sugar in the other corner 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:14.130
 our pinch of salt and in the middle 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.939
 we will open a small volcano quoted where 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.939
 we will put the yeast 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.870
 and when we do not have it, we go back to 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.380
 introduce our bucket in the 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.380
 bakery 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.700
 I simply chose the program in 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.979
 this time he has chosen the program 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.299
 good that corresponds normal to choose a 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:38.670
 weight of these 50 grams 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.619
 and we give the start button we see 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.450
 when the first kneading ends and we 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.330
 has remained in the mass and we cast our 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.160
 remains of water 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.930
 it is all that can change the rise 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.600
 from the beginning to another but perhaps not 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.220
 we press a little water and until 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.200
 really with this recipe does not allow a 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.950
 problem you see we have our ball 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.950
 based 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.409
 and now before the baking starts 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.270
 I recommend that you remove the blades 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.000
 just then the start button to 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.729
 paralyze the system the program the 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.470
 withdrawals and there is no problem and so 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.239
 I really recommend this because the kit 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.340
 when removing it after the breadmaker goes to 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.110
 be much more simple and also 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.420
 we take advantage to extend a little bit in 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.160
 our mass distribute it so that 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.569
 when it comes out it's a palm shape ine 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.489
 climbed more on the one hand and we can 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.370
 take advantage also then look 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.810
 with milk on the surface and 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.569
 we can sprinkle it with some 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:36.620
 sesame seeds you can also put 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:38.540
 for example pumpkin pipes or before in 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.269
 the mixture of the dough with the 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.650
 seeds you can also put a 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.650
 mixed with poppy seeds 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.330
 so you see when these two happen 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.069
 hours will not be a perfect bread a bread 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.410
 which can be cut nicely sliced 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.190
 that we can freeze after choosing 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.110
 loyal to your blog 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.840
 later put them in the toaster 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:02.140
 the cortex of sight is conscious 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.820
 the friend is very compact and juicy and 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.590
 true that flavor is second to none 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.840
 I hope you liked it 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.760
 make you enjoy it and you will tell me 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.200

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.510

 social networks and give me some likes

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.580

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:28.019
