kind of allowed this f5 I think this is
okay<00:02:54.870> because<00:02:54.959> it<00:02:55.109> sort<00:02:55.290> of<00:02:55.379> improves<00:02:55.829> my

okay because it sort of improves my

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.610 
okay because it sort of improves my
default<00:02:56.549> control<00:02:56.939> it<00:02:57.120> does<00:02:57.269> open<00:02:57.510> up<00:02:57.720> that<00:02:58.319> F

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
default control it does open up that F

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.099 
default control it does open up that F
file<00:02:59.120> there<00:03:00.120> but<00:03:00.420> I'm<00:03:00.510> marking<00:03:01.230> out<00:03:01.349> D<00:03:01.379> for

something or coping dangerous so it

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:44.880 
something or coping dangerous so it

um<00:03:46.680> I'm<00:03:47.680> okay<00:03:48.010> here<00:03:48.300> probably<00:03:49.300> look<00:03:49.390> at<00:03:49.480> this

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
um I'm okay here probably look at this

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:57.150 
um I'm okay here probably look at this
position<00:03:51.450> hmm<00:03:54.090> also<00:03:55.319> structurally<00:03:56.319> you<00:03:56.530> know

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
position hmm also structurally you know

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.949 
position hmm also structurally you know
the<00:03:57.340> sea<00:03:57.550> farm<00:03:57.850> could<00:03:58.330> actually<00:03:58.480> be<00:03:58.720> very

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
the sea farm could actually be very

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.949 
the sea farm could actually be very
useful<00:03:58.990> for<00:03:59.319> black<00:03:59.620> later<00:04:00.459> I<00:04:00.819> mean<00:04:01.600> okay<00:04:01.720> why

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
useful for black later I mean okay why

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.530 
useful for black later I mean okay why
it's<00:04:02.110> got<00:04:02.200> the<00:04:02.320> f<00:04:02.470> far<00:04:02.800> but<00:04:03.070> this<00:04:03.160> C<00:04:03.490> file<00:04:03.820> c2

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
it's got the f far but this C file c2

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.430 
it's got the f far but this C file c2
could<00:04:04.959> be<00:04:05.110> a<00:04:05.140> an<00:04:05.920> exploitable<00:04:06.400> target

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
could be a an exploitable target

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.050 
could be a an exploitable target
especially<00:04:08.440> this<00:04:08.770> may<00:04:09.250> be<00:04:09.310> Bishop<00:04:09.760> wasn't

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
especially this may be Bishop wasn't

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.030 
especially this may be Bishop wasn't
protecting<00:04:10.540> see<00:04:11.050> to<00:04:11.200> later<00:04:13.920> so<00:04:14.920> I<00:04:14.980> think

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
protecting see to later so I think

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.449 
protecting see to later so I think
that's<00:04:15.280> another<00:04:15.670> thing<00:04:15.910> about<00:04:16.030> this<00:04:17.459> actually

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
that's another thing about this actually

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.190 
that's another thing about this actually
it's<00:04:18.549> quite<00:04:18.700> rare<00:04:19.030> that<00:04:19.209> someone<00:04:19.540> you<00:04:20.109> know

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
it's quite rare that someone you know

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.080 
it's quite rare that someone you know
makes<00:04:20.410> a<00:04:20.560> blundering<00:04:20.980> officer<00:04:21.669> join<00:04:21.910> and

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
makes a blundering officer join and

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.930 
makes a blundering officer join and
doesn't<00:04:22.360> move<00:04:22.510> up<00:04:22.810> not<00:04:23.230> actually<00:04:23.530> had<00:04:23.680> that

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
doesn't move up not actually had that

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.990 
doesn't move up not actually had that
thought<00:04:24.940> I<00:04:26.280> don't<00:04:27.280> think<00:04:27.430> I<00:04:27.460> remember<00:04:27.669> having

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
thought I don't think I remember having

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.760 
thought I don't think I remember having

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
that before it's a topping it's only

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.010 
that before it's a topping it's only
happened<00:04:30.070> if<00:04:30.700> it<00:04:30.850> has<00:04:30.970> happened<00:04:31.210> before<00:04:31.450> a

happened if it has happened before a

happened if it has happened before a
long<00:04:32.470> time<00:04:32.500> ago<00:04:33.120> then<00:04:34.120> you<00:04:34.240> only<00:04:34.360> have<00:04:34.690> full<00:04:34.900> of

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
games it doesn't seem very mature thing

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.140 
games it doesn't seem very mature thing

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
a blunder I mean okay he has this plan

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.990 
a blunder I mean okay he has this plan
you<00:04:44.919> know<00:04:45.010> to<00:04:45.070> attack<00:04:45.400> default<00:04:45.820> but<00:04:45.910> i've

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
you know to attack default but i've

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.430 
you know to attack default but i've
always<00:04:46.120> got<00:04:46.330> the<00:04:46.360> finch<00:04:46.600> at<00:04:46.780> bishop<00:04:47.140> I<00:04:47.230> mean<00:04:47.350> in

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
always got the finch at bishop I mean in

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.740 
always got the finch at bishop I mean in
principle<00:04:47.980> this<00:04:48.520> is<00:04:48.700> this<00:04:48.820> is<00:04:48.940> nonsense<00:04:49.180> I've

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
principle this is this is nonsense I've

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.630 
principle this is this is nonsense I've
got<00:04:49.900> the<00:04:49.990> Finch<00:04:50.169> at<00:04:50.350> Bishop<00:04:50.740> sort<00:04:51.550> of

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
got the Finch at Bishop sort of

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.820 
got the Finch at Bishop sort of
indirectly<00:04:52.030> guarding<00:04:53.070> the<00:04:54.070> d4<00:04:54.520> pawn<00:04:55.800> also<00:04:56.800> I

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
indirectly guarding the d4 pawn also I

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.640 
indirectly guarding the d4 pawn also I
think<00:04:57.010> here<00:04:57.460> you<00:04:57.880> know<00:04:58.000> Bishop<00:04:58.240> b5<00:04:58.900> I<00:04:59.290> was

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
think here you know Bishop b5 I was

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.830 
think here you know Bishop b5 I was
quickly<00:04:59.890> checking<00:05:00.370> maybe<00:05:01.120> just<00:05:01.300> Bishop<00:05:01.690> d7

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
quickly checking maybe just Bishop d7

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.770 
quickly checking maybe just Bishop d7
other<00:05:04.950> 94<00:05:05.950> might<00:05:06.790> add<00:05:07.030> should<00:05:07.210> be<00:05:07.300> on<00:05:07.419> now<00:05:07.720> it

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
other 94 might add should be on now it

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.630 
other 94 might add should be on now it
takes<00:05:08.020> takes<00:05:08.710> Queen<00:05:09.160> v6<00:05:09.640> check<00:05:11.430> so<00:05:12.430> yeah<00:05:12.610> I

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640 
takes takes Queen v6 check so yeah I

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.670 
takes takes Queen v6 check so yeah I
think<00:05:12.729> Bishop<00:05:13.210> b5<00:05:13.479> Bishop<00:05:13.840> d7<00:05:14.050> I<00:05:14.470> mean<00:05:14.590> this

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
think Bishop b5 Bishop d7 I mean this

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.040 
think Bishop b5 Bishop d7 I mean this
bishop<00:05:15.160> isn't<00:05:15.850> that<00:05:16.120> brilliant<00:05:16.630> at<00:05:16.930> the

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
bishop isn't that brilliant at the

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.790 
bishop isn't that brilliant at the
moment<00:05:18.660> I've<00:05:19.660> it<00:05:19.870> feeling<00:05:20.140> chato's<00:05:20.500> I<00:05:20.650> mean

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
moment I've it feeling chato's I mean

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.300 
moment I've it feeling chato's I mean
what<00:05:20.979> is<00:05:21.070> it<00:05:21.190> was<00:05:21.460> actually<00:05:21.850> heading<00:05:22.919> is<00:05:23.919> this

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
what is it was actually heading is this

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.860 
what is it was actually heading is this
is<00:05:24.460> quite<00:05:24.669> solid<00:05:25.030> wall<00:05:25.210> for<00:05:25.390> a<00:05:25.450> thin<00:05:25.630> chatter

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
is quite solid wall for a thin chatter

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.640 
is quite solid wall for a thin chatter
so<00:05:26.140> maybe<00:05:26.350> I'd<00:05:26.650> wants<00:05:27.130> us<00:05:27.280> off<00:05:28.380> try<00:05:29.380> and<00:05:29.500> play

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
so maybe I'd wants us off try and play

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:36.090 
so maybe I'd wants us off try and play
Bishop<00:05:29.860> d7<00:05:30.160> in<00:05:30.729> the<00:05:30.910> future<00:05:31.240> Roxy<00:05:31.690> 8<00:05:33.000> we<00:05:35.100> so
