00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
PVR uh sometimes wouldn't really record

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.290 
PVR uh sometimes wouldn't really record
right<00:02:42.110> because<00:02:43.040> it's<00:02:43.490> um<00:02:43.640> when<00:02:43.850> i<00:02:43.880> pressed

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
right because it's um when i pressed

when i try recorded its record file you

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.270 
when i try recorded its record file you
maybe<00:02:50.660> like<00:02:51.170> nine<00:02:51.380> min<00:02:51.530> a<00:02:51.560> second<00:02:51.980> and<00:02:52.130> it

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
maybe like nine min a second and it

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.130 
maybe like nine min a second and it
stops<00:02:52.580> recording<00:02:53.090> it<00:02:53.210> works<00:02:53.480> it<00:02:53.750> does<00:02:53.930> up
