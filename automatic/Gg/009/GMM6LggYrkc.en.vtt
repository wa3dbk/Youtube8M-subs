00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.460
 hello dear i have a little case 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.990
 for you and we were in dresden 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.460
 The last three days have one 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.840
 small cities are printing and 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.490
 of course I had to go there too 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.650
 rossmann come in because there is in 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.059
 koblenz not only exist in neuwied 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.590
 and for that I would have to go to the car 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.810
 and then I usually see that 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.430
 but not ready for that and that 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.660
 I could use the opportunity and 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.550
 I would like to show you what I am 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.740
 want that bought family with 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.449
 I already have several from alterra 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.619
 products and has always been 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.130
 very happy with it 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.690
 that's why I had absolutely none 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.530
 Scheider back a few new products 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.930
 to take with me because I actually 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.940
 I am quite convinced that the 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.129
 also determines what will be good and indeed 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.260
 First, the rich body cream 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.309
 for very dry skin with bio 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.559
 pomegranate and organic shea butter and what 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.510
 it could have been different than that 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.510
 smell that convinced me of course 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.020
 the rare excuse but that is 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.629
 delicious 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:06.900
 it smells so fruity and light 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.820
 slightly sourish, why lemony than it 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.530
 right after lemon but that's how it should be 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.400
 annually offer a lemon so that one 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.630
 almost the water in the mouth gets together 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.880
 and even if the care effect is not 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.560
 so insane is like 24 hours moderately 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.470
 here they claim dehydration 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.850
 and anti- roughness even then I am 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:30.240
 probably still excited 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:32.340
 So the main thing is the fragrances holds but then 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.920
 I have next from alterra 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.079
 Also bought the massage oil have three 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.280
 various body cavity had one 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:43.619
 normal body pflegeÃ¶l this then 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.540
 also an anti cellulite oil and this one 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.840
 Massages and this is with almond and 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.909
 celebrate and has practically a coup 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.850
 donor and smells like it could be different 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.020
 its also very good here are 100 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.520
 milliliter in it 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.909
 I think that's pretty much 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:04.500
 for a massage and the great thing is that 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:06.260
 It really is not easy at all 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.229
 Artificially there is that 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.190
 really great with the alta products at the 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.950
 natural cosmetics in general that is 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.510
 you just smell that there is no chemistry 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.030
 that sometimes it smells like that 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.530
 unfortunately and it does not and there I am 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.840
 I'm very curious if I will 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.280
 probably as body oil to 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.900
 still use it on 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.520
 especially women but I believe 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.320
 one or the other massage becomes so 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.930
 also take place and not already 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.700
 very curious because actually it is yes 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.140
 A contradiction with a massage is yes 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.700
 actually beneficial if it is not so 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.090
 quickly moves in during the 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.130
 Massage does not constantly need to oil and 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.200
 when creaming or when you have his 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.670
 then it is 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.170
 yes an advantage if move in quickly 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.950
 so you do not have to wait that long 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.800
 can watch 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:53.120
 I'm very excited then I have 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:57.440
 I also from altera now we come 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:01.250
 not for a very intimate moment 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:07.400
 necessarily the team but yes I have 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:08.810
 be the first anti aging products for me 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.760
 probably share the opinions 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.050
 the one to be you can never soon enough 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.730
 start and the others say 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:18.320
 you're probably still all you 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:20.630
 I'm only 25 anyway I am 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.610
 in opinion one can not actually 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.420
 Start early enough, that means i is with you 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.400
 I am not very nice yet 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.459
 but better too early than too soon 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.340
 late and I prefer to start 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.440
 natural cosmetics products to my skin 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.180
 to care for that specifically 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.670
 face as with chemistry bon because of that 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.739
 I find that a sorry boarding 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:46.740
 easier and yes I do not have me 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:49.350
 this is in a radio transmitter if 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:52.590
 he wants to come out and he looks like this 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:56.640
 here are orchids in there for mature 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.830
 Sophisticated skin cares with hyaluron 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.300
 server and natural qc and that is 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.590
 namely exactly what convinced me 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.320
 that's natural too 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.640
 start you came for yours 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.390
 Taut us even longer 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:11.880
 can not look a bit fresh 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.200
 damage and as it also for dry skin 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.030
 I'll probably think so 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.880
 Use in winter if it really is 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.010
 Absolutely necessary is therefore no worry 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.750
 I do not fall democratically now 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.860
 get in the first case now has to go there 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:27.120
 Now let's stay at Alterra 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.320
 I have two more hand creams 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.820
 I've already taken one with me 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.190
 I can use it several times already 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.170
 say great 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.780
 this one is also pomegranate and 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:41.430
 aloe vera not insane this time 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:43.170
 Becker is not so tasty this one is 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.060
 for very dry skin and this for 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.530
 normal skin that means I use 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.990
 right now it does not have to be that way yet 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.420
 but it is freezing cold when it is 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.590
 so I get into the minus area 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.400
 very quickly that she was inhibited and there 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.150
 I'll probably be the one 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.470
 So I need that here 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.450
 say that really absorbs quickly 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:04.620
 not too pleasant here is bio 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:07.020
 chameleon bio super delicious super 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.760
 pleasant, wonderful, so good 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.530
 great care effect does not last 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.510
 necessarily on the hand washing 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.220
 after that I have to be new again 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:17.960
 creaming this is a small minus point 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:20.130
 but still very good throughout 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.170
 what actually with the terra 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.000
 but here are handcremes following 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.640
 synergies I took another 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.480
 but only because they are so delicious after vanilla 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:32.580
 has done or not quite great here 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.860
 so sweet little bees and bunnies and 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.940
 chicks are baptized 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.110
 yes you also have it extra 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.570
 written not suitable for consumption 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.190
 Just to taste licks smells 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.800
 want to almost say that one 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.870
 is probably enticed to yes 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.070
 This is 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.750
 I'm really looking forward to that 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.700
 not said the great care effect 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.320
 although it appears that it is dry 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:54.200
 skin is and also 24 hours 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.550
 moisture promises and but that 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.980
 Here I am really more like that 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.000
 I was able to take a few high up 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.700
 but do not let it stand 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.350
 also nail polish remover one can 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:06.140
 somehow also need 250 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:09.860
 milliliter pack super relatively cheap 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:12.980
 in the relationship with dismiss also 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:15.170
 i had dm in the last roll 

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.310
 also buy nail polish in craps 

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.020
 to do likewise because as I said 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.240
 sometimes you just need that 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.530
 after which color and obmann glitter 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.480
 lag is used that is very 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.860
 meaningful 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.360
 this one will always be in the 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.070
 highest praised praise so I guess 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.830
 Here is really well spent money 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:31.280
 And yes, you can not do more than that 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.990
 say 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.940
 besides, I only have two more dry ones 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.370
 Schampus bought which I like to test 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.110
 would like him to do that for himself 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.150
 dry barriers for immediately refreshed 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.460
 the hair i think there is designer 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.640
 only one variety as far as I can see 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:48.050
 could 

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:51.230
 I can not talk too much about that yet 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:53.960
 say there was another spray nozzle in there 

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:56.780
 shelf that was already wants he already has 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.220
 had someone pushed it the 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.140
 I then use more make time 

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:03.080
 So the nose was kept so far 

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:05.120
 pleasant what I can say what I am 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:09.890
 I do not like when the dry came 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:12.830
 so yes, yes, there are also disgusting 

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:14.600
 dry bent and especially if you are 

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:16.220
 which then gets the whole day because that 

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:19.400
 yes on my head and then 

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:24.550
 does not evaporate the other is by looking 

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:26.840
 Let's cook the fresh dry shampoo and 

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:28.970
 It also smells very pleasantly fresh 

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.470
 say yes and I will definitely 

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:32.540
 case I compare so far 

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:36.260
 three different dry shampoo it 

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:37.700
 Tried and now I will the times 

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.020
 still to take and the comparison 

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.670
 let's see if it is 

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.490
 even worth a video if you like that 

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:45.890
 interested please let me know 

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:47.330
 and yes, I'm very excited 

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:49.940
 I took the two with me and gave it 

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:51.500
 then two more were mine 

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.350
 but frankly so expensive that in 

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.290
 the 2 

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:56.000
 cheapest in comparison 100 milliliters 

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:58.290
 etc 

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.950
 and therefore we are the times
