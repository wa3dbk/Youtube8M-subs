you're going to bring it to the to the

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.080 
you're going to bring it to the to the
sand<00:05:49.360> over<00:05:49.690> here<00:05:49.900> so<00:05:50.050> it<00:05:50.170> copies<00:05:50.560> a<00:05:50.910> piece<00:05:51.910> of

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090 
sand over here so it copies a piece of

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:58.950 
sand over here so it copies a piece of
sand

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:05.550 

just<00:05:59.740> a<00:06:00.039> tad<00:06:00.280> more<00:06:03.690> right<00:06:04.690> about<00:06:04.990> there<00:06:05.259> that's

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
just a tad more right about there that's

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:11.909 
just a tad more right about there that's
good<00:06:09.539> now<00:06:10.539> see<00:06:10.930> that<00:06:11.080> green<00:06:11.440> I<00:06:11.560> want<00:06:11.740> to<00:06:11.800> get

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:11.919
