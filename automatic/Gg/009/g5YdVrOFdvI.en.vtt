that's<00:03:48.849> pretty<00:03:49.030> much<00:03:49.269> all<00:03:49.479> I<00:03:49.540> use<00:03:49.930> now<00:03:50.680> now<00:03:51.129> and

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
that's pretty much all I use now now and

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.460 
that's pretty much all I use now now and
then<00:03:51.519> I<00:03:51.759> will<00:03:51.819> use<00:03:52.269> a<00:03:52.329> bit<00:03:52.659> of<00:03:52.689> argan<00:03:53.349> oil

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
then I will use a bit of argan oil

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.009 
then I will use a bit of argan oil
