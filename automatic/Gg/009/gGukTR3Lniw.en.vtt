00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
45 degrees means you're gonna go with

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.560 
45 degrees means you're gonna go with
the<00:01:40.890> game<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:41.730> if<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:41.910> press<00:01:42.060> down<00:01:42.330> you're

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
the game so if you press down you're

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.290 
the game so if you press down you're
gonna

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
gonna

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.929 
gonna
for<00:01:43.630> the<00:01:43.690> right

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
for the right

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.230 
for the right
so<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.479> thought

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
so I thought

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.630 
so I thought
I<00:01:47.270> think<00:01:47.990> if<00:01:48.110> permission<00:01:48.410> is<00:01:48.740> a<00:01:48.860> 90-degree<00:01:49.310> one

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
I think if permission is a 90-degree one

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.680 
I think if permission is a 90-degree one
now<00:01:50.980> so<00:01:51.980> would<00:01:52.460> you<00:01:52.550> stop<00:01:52.940> falling<00:01:53.240> in<00:01:53.480> hurry

of being just killing me so we're gonna
go<00:04:09.710> into<00:04:09.950> single-player<00:04:10.850> mode<00:04:11.120> for<00:04:11.330> a<00:04:11.360> while

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
go into single-player mode for a while

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.860 
go into single-player mode for a while
and<00:04:11.660> let<00:04:11.780> her<00:04:11.960> I<00:04:12.260> wonder<00:04:13.130> if<00:04:13.280> you'll<00:04:13.550> read<00:04:13.870> all

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
and let her I wonder if you'll read all

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.259 
and let her I wonder if you'll read all
those<00:04:15.140> black<00:04:16.010> sides<00:04:16.340> you're<00:04:16.910> seeing<00:04:17.180> right

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
those black sides you're seeing right

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.420 
those black sides you're seeing right
now<00:04:17.329> they're<00:04:17.660> up<00:04:17.870> have<00:04:18.320> a<00:04:18.350> rubber<00:04:18.829> bouncing

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
now they're up have a rubber bouncing

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.640 
now they're up have a rubber bouncing
material<00:04:19.850> so<00:04:20.060> they<00:04:20.180> bounce<00:04:20.390> and<00:04:20.840> when<00:04:21.290> you<00:04:21.410> hit

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
material so they bounce and when you hit

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.890 
material so they bounce and when you hit
the<00:04:21.890> side<00:04:22.130> that<00:04:22.460> totally<00:04:22.850> you<00:04:23.540> go<00:04:23.660> in<00:04:23.810> the

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
the side that totally you go in the

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.180 
the side that totally you go in the
opposite<00:04:24.230> direction<00:04:24.290> which<00:04:24.770> makes<00:04:25.040> it<00:04:25.160> a

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190
