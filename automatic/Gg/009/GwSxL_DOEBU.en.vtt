 this video what I will not show you as 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.470
 uninstall a skin for anyone 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.840
 we will use a very good application the 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.090
 revo uninstaller also in case you do not 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.010
 works and does not take away all the 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.029
 changes that the skin made so that in its 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.190
 computer 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.470
 after uninstalling the skin pack with 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.750
 the revo uninstaller will execute the 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.900
 little program called ring in speak in your 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.900
 watch 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:40.150
 as you can see the skin pack that 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.130
 I have installed now on my pc is one of 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.500
 the ones that people ask me like 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.840
 can do to uninstall it since 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.390
 this skin so that it applies a change almost 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.430
 total in our operating system you will be 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.550
 it makes it difficult to be uninstalled with the 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.380
 classic windows uninstaller good 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.750
 we'll start running the revo 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.850
 uninstaller and we will proceed to search in 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.100
 the list provided by the revo 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.850
 Vistalegre the skin pack we would have 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.460
 to definitely remove from our pc 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.619
 there it is, we select it with a click 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.140
 over it and then we go up to the 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.900
 Uninstalled eyelash 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.940
 we click on uninstall we will leave 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:23.220
 what if we are sure of wanting 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.220
 uninstall the skin we give yes 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.420
 here he asks us for an uninstall mode 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.810
 we choose the last option mode 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.810
 advanced 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.970
 now it will create a point of 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:50.280
 restoration for security is automatic 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.650
 you do not have to do anything 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.700
 we just wait for the installer 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.700
 finish your work 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.390
 now pay attention here 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.790
 we select all the boxes that we 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.040
 this goes to completely eliminate the 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.730
 modifications made by the skin so that 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.730
 in our system 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.319
 and we click on wing salt now if 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.930
 the program is removing all the 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.379
 pac components we hope a 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.379
 moment 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.260

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.260

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.190

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:18.269
 the original windows components 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:20.670
 like registry folders cmd console panel 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.180

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.180
 more things 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.180
 what we will do is select all 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.550
 the options of this window and give 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.490
 click on re on 'talk ask us 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:38.220
 restart the operating system because what 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:41.750
 we reboot since the effects will arise 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.750
 only after a restart 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.120

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.670
 second time we will see what of the skin pad 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.790

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.750
 home windows icons folders 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.790
