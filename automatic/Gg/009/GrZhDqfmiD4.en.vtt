00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.789 
facing square and it's facing to the
side<00:02:23.450> then<00:02:23.810> you<00:02:23.930> should<00:02:24.109> mess<00:02:24.260> up<00:02:24.410> your<00:02:24.590> back

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799 
side then you should mess up your back

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.509 
side then you should mess up your back
someday<00:02:25.700> and<00:02:26.859> make<00:02:27.859> sure<00:02:28.010> they<00:02:28.190> stretch

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
someday and make sure they stretch

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.370 
someday and make sure they stretch
properly<00:02:28.820> because<00:02:29.299> if<00:02:29.780> you<00:02:29.900> stretch<00:02:30.170> properly

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
properly because if you stretch properly

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.710 
properly because if you stretch properly
then<00:02:30.890> your<00:02:31.430> needle<00:02:31.820> will<00:02:31.970> look<00:02:32.150> better<00:02:32.390> and<00:02:32.600> it

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
then your needle will look better and it

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.259 
then your needle will look better and it
won't<00:02:32.900> look<00:02:33.019> sloppy<00:02:33.350> like<00:02:34.220> a<00:02:34.250> scale<00:02:34.670> because

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
won't look sloppy like a scale because

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.539 
won't look sloppy like a scale because
some<00:02:35.480> people<00:02:35.810> who<00:02:36.200> they<00:02:36.709> try<00:02:36.890> to<00:02:36.950> rush<00:02:37.250> getting

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
some people who they try to rush getting

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.090 
some people who they try to rush getting
their<00:02:37.820> needles<00:02:38.150> and<00:02:38.359> when<00:02:39.170> you<00:02:39.350> do<00:02:39.500> that<00:02:39.680> you

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
their needles and when you do that you

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.160 
their needles and when you do that you
make<00:02:40.340> it<00:02:40.519> look<00:02:40.730> sloppy<00:02:41.090> and<00:02:41.570> it<00:02:41.780> looks<00:02:41.959> like<00:02:42.140> a

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
make it look sloppy and it looks like a

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:48.420 
make it look sloppy and it looks like a
scale<00:02:43.480> so<00:02:44.480> make<00:02:45.440> sure<00:02:45.470> that<00:02:46.299> when<00:02:47.299> you're

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
scale so make sure that when you're

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.500 
scale so make sure that when you're
practicing<00:02:49.430> for<00:02:49.459> your<00:02:49.700> needle<00:02:50.030> stretching
