00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 What chavalada in view of the 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.359
 last two videos that I made of kitchen os 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.790
 they had flown or had enough 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.550
 interaction in plan retained talking 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.830
 Miami or answering we tell you things 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.650
 philosophical of life touches us and cooks 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.710
 shabby are not the way of ninja not of 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.359
 each one and I've decided that perhaps more 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.390
 videos of this style because it would not be 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.120
 bad not so, apparently you like it 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.900
 see how 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.779
 yes 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.750
 as then today what he is going to touch is 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.900
 make a delicious strawberry cake and I'm going to 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.180
 say no cheese not a cheesecake 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.370
 we 're not going to because I'm the tips of 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.860
 the cheese cakes and I say a 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.379
 cheesecake here here and now for you 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.199
 of respect 'an English with a very accent 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:55.489
 Russian and good first thing we're going to 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:58.489
 catch is milk and cheese obviously the 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.489
 cream 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:10.370
 host after 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.370
 I do not have cheese 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.870
 If you do not forget your Christmas or buy the 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.350
 cheese 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.350
 yes 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:28.620
 cheese cake not without that not being a 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.620
 temporary paradox 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.470
 today speaking of cheese the cheese is 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.110
 made of milk 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.330
 have you ever stopped to think about 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.810
 that we are the only species that 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.130
 we drink the milk of another species 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.430
 because we usually have 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:49.250
 milk or cow's milk, not for the 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.190
 cheeses that goat and things like that but 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:56.330
 I say there is no other fucking bitch in 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:59.090
 the land that drinks milk of another species 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.100
 you know, it's like 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.929
 it's really a bit weird is not it 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.109
 because it makes us sick to see how milk 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:08.750
 human but it would be theirs but instead 

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:10.759
 drink us the milk of another species is 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.130
 that we think with an idea suddenly 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:16.340
 very good not bone 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.440
 I do not know is that all this was 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.680
 talking and the other day a friend who 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.049
 now he is vegetarian 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.689
 plan commenting a bit on the subject and she 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:29.200
 I explain it to myself, not in the sense that 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:31.000
 She still became vegan but that 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.269
 plan reasoning a bit the fact that 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.889
 I see the milk of another species not 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:41.109
 I mean, it's like it's happening, it's not happening to you 

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:44.409
 and I do not know or is the cows so 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:47.799
 produce milk they have to have babies 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:50.889
 not the calves and we eat 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:53.100
 the calves and we're left with their milk 

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:57.000
 uncle 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:59.340
 and it's like to see how I explain to you 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.220
 let's kill the young you just 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.960
 have and we will stay with your milk 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.990
 for us 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:12.820
 and then we kill you also not be 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:17.000
 it's like you said you know in plan of the real 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:20.690
 write or be century 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.970
 or because nature is like 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.640
 tiger eats the zebra and shits like that 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.010
 not in plan hunting or the birds at 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.070
 insects not in plan they go for their prey and 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:34.850
 they eat it but other races know 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:37.459
 that catches another species I killed their young 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:40.840
 and stay or stay with their 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.840
 shits not be 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.770
 not equal he eats his young and he throws 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.200
 but plan to eat their young 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:51.580
 precisely to stay then with their 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.580
 with his things is like 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:00.010
 but that is, if you think about it 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:02.790
 it's really a pretty gel 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.790
 I dont know 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.850
 it's pretty heavy
