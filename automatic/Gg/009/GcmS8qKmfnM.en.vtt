hi<00:00:00.240> this<00:00:00.299> is<00:00:00.510> Jeff<00:00:00.810> again<00:00:01.079> I<00:00:01.260> just<00:00:01.560> wanted<00:00:01.770> to

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
hi this is Jeff again I just wanted to

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.770 
hi this is Jeff again I just wanted to
show<00:00:02.010> you<00:00:02.040> you<00:00:02.159> do<00:00:02.490> your<00:00:02.639> self<00:00:02.909> nitrate

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
show you you do your self nitrate

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.329 
show you you do your self nitrate
reactor<00:00:04.500> that<00:00:04.740> I<00:00:04.830> built

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
reactor that I built

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.120 
reactor that I built
it's<00:00:05.609> a<00:00:05.670> soulful<00:00:05.910> reactor<00:00:06.859> the<00:00:07.859> water

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
it's a soulful reactor the water

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.020 
it's a soulful reactor the water
actually<00:00:08.400> comes<00:00:08.820> in<00:00:09.360> on<00:00:09.929> this<00:00:10.139> pipe<00:00:10.349> here<00:00:11.030> goes

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
actually comes in on this pipe here goes

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.440 
actually comes in on this pipe here goes
into<00:00:12.210> this<00:00:12.360> chamber<00:00:12.660> and<00:00:13.410> because<00:00:13.740> this<00:00:13.950> is<00:00:14.099> a

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:14.450 
into this chamber and because this is a

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.870 
into this chamber and because this is a
I<00:00:15.450> can<00:00:16.199> take<00:00:16.350> this<00:00:16.470> apart<00:00:16.949> all<00:00:17.430> right<00:00:17.550> this<00:00:17.730> is

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
I can take this apart all right this is

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.510 
I can take this apart all right this is
just<00:00:17.910> abnormal<00:00:18.539> plumbing<00:00:18.930> piece<00:00:19.400> that<00:00:20.400> allows

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
just abnormal plumbing piece that allows

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.519 
just abnormal plumbing piece that allows
you<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.820> separate<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.300> this<00:00:21.779> whole<00:00:21.990> chamber<00:00:22.260> is

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
you to separate it this whole chamber is

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.910 
you to separate it this whole chamber is
full<00:00:22.769> of<00:00:22.980> sulfur<00:00:24.320> this<00:00:25.320> is<00:00:25.529> just<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.740> water

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
full of sulfur this is just a water

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.519 
full of sulfur this is just a water
chamber<00:00:26.250> here<00:00:26.550> at<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.760> top<00:00:26.939> this<00:00:27.840> is<00:00:27.900> allow<00:00:28.349> me

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
chamber here at the top this is allow me

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.460 
chamber here at the top this is allow me
to<00:00:28.650> let<00:00:29.039> out<00:00:29.160> any<00:00:29.369> excess<00:00:29.760> gas<00:00:30.260> and<00:00:31.260> then<00:00:31.380> it

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
to let out any excess gas and then it

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.659 
to let out any excess gas and then it
goes<00:00:31.560> back<00:00:31.710> into<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.070> chamber<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.550> this

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
goes back into this chamber and this

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.170 
goes back into this chamber and this
chamber<00:00:32.969> is<00:00:33.030> full<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.420> coal<00:00:33.860> and<00:00:34.940> then<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.030> just

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
chamber is full of coal and then it just

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.940 
chamber is full of coal and then it just
comes<00:00:36.329> down<00:00:36.450> into<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.809> drip<00:00:37.110> now<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.410> problem<00:00:37.860> I

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
comes down into a drip now the problem I

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.000 
comes down into a drip now the problem I
had<00:00:38.070> with<00:00:38.190> this<00:00:38.370> reactor<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.510> can't<00:00:40.350> control

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
had with this reactor is I can't control

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.729 
had with this reactor is I can't control
the<00:00:41.340> output<00:00:41.489> flow<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.690> finite<00:00:43.200> amount<00:00:43.440> of

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
the output flow and a finite amount of

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.470 
the output flow and a finite amount of
level<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.309> have<00:00:44.610> difficulty<00:00:45.120> getting<00:00:45.270> the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
level so I have difficulty getting the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.049 
level so I have difficulty getting the
right<00:00:45.660> drip<00:00:45.870> speed<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.739> as<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.430> can<00:00:47.520> see<00:00:47.579> here

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
right drip speed and as you can see here

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.920 
right drip speed and as you can see here
but<00:00:48.930> actually<00:00:49.079> running<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:49.910> out<00:00:50.910> into<00:00:53.449> as<00:00:54.449> a

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
but actually running this out into as a

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.299 
but actually running this out into as a
waste<00:00:55.289> right<00:00:55.530> now<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:56.039> know<00:00:56.129> I'm<00:00:56.190> trying

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
waste right now it you know I'm trying

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.709 
waste right now it you know I'm trying
to<00:00:56.460> get<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.640> drip<00:00:56.820> rate<00:00:57.030> going<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:58.530> see

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
to get the drip rate going you see

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:02.270 
to get the drip rate going you see
that's<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.899> drip<00:01:01.170> rate<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:01.620> have<00:01:01.920> for

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
that's the drip rate that I have for

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.859 
that's the drip rate that I have for
this<00:01:02.430> reactor<00:01:02.930> that<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.080> now<00:01:04.350> producing<00:01:05.869> zero

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
this reactor that is now producing zero

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.789 
this reactor that is now producing zero
nitrites<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.740> zero<00:01:08.189> nitrates<00:01:09.560> pretty<00:01:10.560> small

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
nitrites and zero nitrates pretty small

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.260 
nitrites and zero nitrates pretty small
drip<00:01:11.040> rate<00:01:11.220> but<00:01:11.430> if<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.580> add<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:11.850> up<00:01:12.030> you're

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
drip rate but if you add that up you're

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.670 
drip rate but if you add that up you're
probably<00:01:12.540> it's<00:01:12.869> probably<00:01:13.140> going<00:01:13.260> at<00:01:13.470> about<00:01:13.650> a

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
probably it's probably going at about a

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.070 
probably it's probably going at about a
gallon<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.159> day<00:01:14.250> maybe<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.330> have<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.479> 300<00:01:15.990> gallon

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
gallon a day maybe I have a 300 gallon

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.730 
gallon a day maybe I have a 300 gallon
tank<00:01:16.500> so<00:01:17.210> over<00:01:18.210> time<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.630> will<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:19.049> has<00:01:19.080> already

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
tank so over time it will it has already

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.249 
tank so over time it will it has already
helps<00:01:20.430> me<00:01:20.520> drop<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.970> nitrites<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.689> nitrate

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
helps me drop the nitrites and nitrate

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.630 
helps me drop the nitrites and nitrate
levels<00:01:22.790> the<00:01:23.790> nitrates<00:01:24.450> actually<00:01:25.080> went<00:01:25.290> up

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
levels the nitrates actually went up

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.030 
levels the nitrates actually went up
because<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:26.820> turned<00:01:27.720> this<00:01:27.900> thing<00:01:28.140> up<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.530> and

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
because I turned this thing up and and

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.060 
because I turned this thing up and and
turn<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.490> on<00:01:29.549> too<00:01:29.790> fast<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:31.590> started<00:01:32.040> to

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
turn it on too fast and it started to

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.850 
turn it on too fast and it started to
produce<00:01:32.850> nitrites<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.780> nitrates<00:01:33.869> which<00:01:34.530> way

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
produce nitrites and nitrates which way

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.170 
produce nitrites and nitrates which way
right<00:01:35.130> into<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.400> main<00:01:35.549> tank<00:01:35.790> which<00:01:36.030> was

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
right into the main tank which was

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.450 
right into the main tank which was
mistake<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.140> make<00:01:37.290> sure<00:01:37.320> when<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.799> turn<00:01:38.310> that

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
mistake so make sure when you turn that

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.600 
mistake so make sure when you turn that
speed<00:01:38.759> up<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.509> push<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.170> flow<00:01:40.610> you

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
speed up that you push that flow you

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.149 
speed up that you push that flow you
capture<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.090> somewhere<00:01:42.409> or<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.649> send<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.040> out

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
capture it somewhere or you send it out

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.780 
capture it somewhere or you send it out
to<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.700> waste<00:01:45.090> receptacle<00:01:46.159> until<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.369> those

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
to a waste receptacle until that those

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.969 
to a waste receptacle until that those
nitrates<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.420> nitrates<00:01:48.840> are<00:01:49.500> reduced

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
nitrates and nitrates are reduced

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.980 
nitrates and nitrates are reduced
alright<00:01:50.820> I'm<00:01:51.030> gonna<00:01:51.180> let<00:01:51.329> this<00:01:51.420> guy<00:01:51.600> run<00:01:51.810> down

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
alright I'm gonna let this guy run down

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.499 
alright I'm gonna let this guy run down
because<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.649> level<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.009> correct<00:01:53.360> it's<00:01:54.360> not

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
because the level is correct it's not

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.440 
because the level is correct it's not
going<00:01:54.750> into<00:01:54.869> my<00:01:55.049> name<00:01:55.290> ain't<00:01:55.649> Inc<00:01:56.210> and<00:01:57.210> just<00:01:57.390> to

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
going into my name ain't Inc and just to

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.010 
going into my name ain't Inc and just to
show<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.659> here<00:01:57.869> this<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.079> my<00:01:58.320> outside<00:01:59.009> sump

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
show you here this is my outside sump
