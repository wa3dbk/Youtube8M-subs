that you have these applications running

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.380 
that you have these applications running
in<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.740> background<00:00:31.890> like<00:00:32.520> for<00:00:32.700> example<00:00:32.940> I

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
in the background like for example I

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.380 
in the background like for example I
have<00:00:33.420> safari<00:00:33.930> running<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.790> have<00:00:35.910> my<00:00:36.090> mail

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.740 
have safari running and I have my mail
application<00:00:36.690> running<00:00:37.469> i<00:00:37.800> got<00:00:37.980> my<00:00:38.750> settings

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
application running i got my settings

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.860 
application running i got my settings
running<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:41.180> what<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.329> can<00:00:42.450> do<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:42.629> can

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
running and what you can do you can

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.979 
running and what you can do you can
simply<00:00:43.410> click<00:00:43.649> on<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.920> corner<00:00:44.370> here<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.879> X<00:00:45.750> I

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
simply click on the corner here and X I

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.170 
simply click on the corner here and X I
the<00:00:46.050> process<00:00:46.980> therefore<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.670> will<00:00:47.789> not<00:00:48.000> be

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
the process therefore it will not be

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.630 
the process therefore it will not be
running<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.870> helps<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:49.860> conserve<00:00:50.250> memory

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
running and it helps you conserve memory

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.310 
running and it helps you conserve memory
and<00:00:51.059> stuff<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.629> therefore<00:00:52.079> your

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
and stuff and therefore your

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.619 
and stuff and therefore your
applications<00:00:52.980> will<00:00:53.100> open<00:00:53.370> up<00:00:53.460> faster<00:00:54.059> because

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
applications will open up faster because

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.170 
applications will open up faster because
as<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.770> lot<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.280> may<00:00:56.430> know<00:00:56.610> if<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:56.850> have<00:00:56.969> too

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
as a lot of you may know if you have too

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.080 
as a lot of you may know if you have too
many<00:00:57.300> applications<00:00:58.109> open<00:00:58.800> they<00:00:59.550> hog<00:00:59.789> up<00:00:59.969> the

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
many applications open they hog up the

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.130 
many applications open they hog up the
memory<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:02.000> yeah<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.270> makes<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.780> whole

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
memory and yeah it makes the whole

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.250 
memory and yeah it makes the whole
device<00:01:04.530> running<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.920> little<00:01:05.070> bit<00:01:05.250> slower<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:06.570> I

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
device running a little bit slower so I

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.640 
device running a little bit slower so I
got<00:01:07.770> YouTube<00:01:08.220> open<00:01:08.520> over<00:01:08.729> here<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.650> notice

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.420 
pretty sure there might be something
something<00:01:58.380> that's<00:01:58.560> addressed<00:01:58.829> in<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.219> later

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
something that's addressed in a later

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.760 
something that's addressed in a later
update<00:01:59.640> but<00:02:00.149> for<00:02:00.360> now<00:02:00.479> I'm<00:02:00.990> not<00:02:01.320> too<00:02:01.500> sure

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
update but for now I'm not too sure

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.289 
update but for now I'm not too sure
about<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:02.219> little<00:02:02.399> glowing<00:02:02.700> effect<00:02:03.119> that

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
about the little glowing effect that

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.419 
about the little glowing effect that
they<00:02:03.420> talked<00:02:03.689> about<00:02:03.990> with<00:02:04.140> this<00:02:04.549> tweak<00:02:06.140> and<00:02:07.429> if

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
they talked about with this tweak and if

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.070 
they talked about with this tweak and if
you<00:02:08.550> go<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.700> settings<00:02:09.149> here<00:02:10.849> you<00:02:11.849> can

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
you go to settings here you can

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.460 
you go to settings here you can
uh<00:02:13.940> go<00:02:14.940> to<00:02:15.000> running<00:02:15.300> indicator<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:16.170> you<00:02:16.320> can

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
uh go to running indicator and you can

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.060 
uh go to running indicator and you can
remove<00:02:16.710> the<00:02:16.890> exes<00:02:17.960> so<00:02:18.960> show<00:02:19.260> close<00:02:19.560> buttons

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
remove the exes so show close buttons

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.070 
remove the exes so show close buttons
you<00:02:20.280> can<00:02:20.310> cut<00:02:20.550> that<00:02:20.700> off<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:21.180> it<00:02:21.540> removes<00:02:21.840> them

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
you can cut that off and it removes them

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.420 
you can cut that off and it removes them
but<00:02:22.290> i'm<00:02:22.470> pretty<00:02:22.620> sure<00:02:22.860> you<00:02:22.890> want<00:02:23.160> to<00:02:23.250> go<00:02:23.340> ahead

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
but i'm pretty sure you want to go ahead

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.190 
but i'm pretty sure you want to go ahead
and<00:02:23.670> keep<00:02:23.760> those<00:02:23.970> on<00:02:24.270> just<00:02:24.690> so<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:24.870> can<00:02:25.020> know

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
and keep those on just so you can know

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.320 
and keep those on just so you can know
if<00:02:25.410> your<00:02:26.070> applications<00:02:26.790> are<00:02:26.940> running<00:02:27.060> in<00:02:27.270> the

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
if your applications are running in the

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.050 
if your applications are running in the
background<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:28.080> you<00:02:28.230> not<00:02:28.830> are<00:02:29.070> injured<00:02:29.820> that

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
background and you not are injured that

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.610 
background and you not are injured that
you're<00:02:30.240> not<00:02:30.390> completely<00:02:30.690> sure<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.290> all<00:02:31.410> that

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
you're not completely sure and all that

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.010 
you're not completely sure and all that
so<00:02:32.280> overall<00:02:33.030> this<00:02:33.330> is<00:02:33.480> one<00:02:33.660> of<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.840> most

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
so overall this is one of the most

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.500 
so overall this is one of the most
useful<00:02:34.380> tweaks<00:02:34.710> I've<00:02:35.070> found<00:02:35.340> so<00:02:35.670> far<00:02:35.700> in<00:02:36.120> cydia
