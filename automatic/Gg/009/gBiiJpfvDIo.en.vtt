00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 very good and today we are again in the 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.170
 review in a very interesting way very 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.620
 useful and that will allow us to troll to 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.349
 our friends or hunt so 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:17.070
 tactical this mod is called trap craft and 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:20.609
 now we will see what gives us here what 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.380
 we have the first fun fans we 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.539
 brings fans that really are 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:29.849
 very very useful you will see for example 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:34.050
 put a fan here and another 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:37.170
 example here and a third 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.000
 here is worth all are activated with reston 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.820
 for example with something that gives them energy 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.420
 just like a piston is worth it then we put 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.460
 here a little more and here not here and 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.950
 now we put on and as you can see is a 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.410
 air path transport us alone is 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.039
 perfect to be able to do well roads 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.440
 more efficient and fast good as 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:03.269
 create the fan now you will see 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.159
 is created like this by putting rock with one of 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.470
 iron and the advantage is that rock by 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.600
 merapi case you can stay and that 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.860
 fan that we have the most because 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.810
 example we have this grass cover 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.149
 what is the grass cover for? 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.640
 now you will see for example here we make a 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.490
 perfect hole let's do the 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.030
 biggest hole 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.560
 here and there we will take the 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:34.200
 creative 4 1 2 3 4 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.880
 and pam pum when we step we fall and it's 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.979
 a good way to cheat then 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.689
 to troll our teammates or 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.189
 to hunt and keep the animals 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:47.520
 there as you catch this grass very 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:50.549
 easy so we put grass that is caught with 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.530
 some shears and sticks sticks down already 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.960
 is when the animal also falls 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.530
 returns the stick so it comes out very 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.340
 very well priced and we also have 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.440
 we have spikes spikes from here I do not have 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.420
 to tell a lot of truth what they do 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.920
 the spikes because when you fall 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.869
 over you click 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.349
 They are skewers and skewers 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:16.380
 pinch is very clear and this is craft 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:20.099
 And so you see doing as a kind of 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:24.330
 skewer with iron ingots is worth 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:25.799
 now the magnetic box is missing, you'll see 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.870
 you'll see why this one confirms critical 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:30.630
 look how thank you garcia well 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.160
 putting any type of wood with a 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.890
 ingot iron and one of rest 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.090
 very very useful because look we can say 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.800
 magnetic comfort and for example 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.780
 we throw sticks we throw sticks here 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.210
 It is worth absorbing them and now we 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.210
 we are inside is really very 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.890
 useful for example for that struggling 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.630
 against many monsters put a chest 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.490
 magnetic and that the objects that are going 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.320
 releasing those monsters go being 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.990
 attracted by the chest and therefore later 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:02.440
 you have everything so together and we 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:04.810
 something else will be missing if the bear trap 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.400
 the trap for things that really do not 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.620
 it has to be for bears can be 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.460
 for any animal that you will see as 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.980
 how it is used for example here we put it 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.540
 you see would be perfect open we can 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.910
 going over we do not hurt ourselves and 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.280
 now for example let's catch chickens and 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:25.630
 seeds this we can return it to 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:28.660
 perfect creative here and there and 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.660
 we take chickens and seeds worth 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.390
 now let's wait a little bit here and 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.370
 we are going to teach you these little seeds that 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:40.540
 so much you like then you will come by 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.550
 here is going to come here and stay 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.890
 caught if you try to move as if 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.560
 trying to move because it hurts 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.260
 until he dies evidently and loose 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.810
 good your little things and if we want this not 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.240
 is lost this we give a click 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.300
 right and it's open again for 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:00.880
 hunt another very useful animal no longer so much 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.650
 to hunt animals and food but to 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.330
 protect you from the zombies at night 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.760
 and call him zombies 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.440
 call him creepers called farmers but it's 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.959
 very useful because they are retained 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.720
 so if you surround yourself around your house 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.930
 this will not be able to happen and yet 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.310
 you do because you do not get caught 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:22.090
 good what would be the perfect combination 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:26.740
 of all this, now you will see I'm missing 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:30.729
 some fans to see 12 and I'm missing 1 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:33.150
 antorchitas of rest 1 and 2 perfect 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:36.310
 now I put the fan for example 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:40.240
 here it is and no no no no no 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:42.009
 concretely I have to put it here 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.220
 who does not want to put you hear what we put 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:47.470
 so and now we activate it then it does 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.960
 a current of air very well then 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.360
 we put chicks for example we put 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:57.699
 chicks and what happens that the combination 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:05:00.400
 between trampitas de de hierba and los 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:02.620
 sticks and all this can be a trap 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.530
 to hunt a trap to hunt 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:08.590
 perfect because look good and we leave 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:11.650
 of spurring chicks and you will see that 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:14.229
 past beijing look how he gets 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.240
 in the chest because I go here 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:18.699
 and I say obvious I have food over here 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.900
 food and sticks that are the sticks of 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:25.370
 these traps 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:29.120
 more sticks and food and feathers great and 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:31.220
 creates a perfect trap to hunt or if 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.830
 you can put lava or spikes like 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.919
 here and comment to your friends for 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:40.310
 passing and die and die for 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:41.960
 stuck in the pinchitos I hope that you 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.240
 this mode has been useful because I want 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.669
 that can be very very fun to 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.470
 do all kinds of traps and os 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:50.300
 I leave the download link in the 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.889
 description if you liked it you already know 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.660
 to like to share it with everyone 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:55.660
