00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
ever since i've been using all of that

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.490 
ever since i've been using all of that
hand<00:04:43.490> sanitizer<00:04:44.000> at<00:04:44.210> work<00:04:44.450> they've<00:04:45.170> become

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
hand sanitizer at work they've become

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.070 
hand sanitizer at work they've become
really<00:04:45.740> weak<00:04:46.490> and<00:04:46.820> they<00:04:47.150> peel<00:04:47.630> they<00:04:47.900> don't

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
really weak and they peel they don't

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.380 
really weak and they peel they don't
break<00:04:48.470> but<00:04:48.860> they<00:04:48.980> peel<00:04:49.460> like<00:04:49.790> every<00:04:50.090> time<00:04:50.210> it

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 
break but they peel like every time it

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.659 
break but they peel like every time it
gets<00:04:50.480> to<00:04:50.630> the<00:04:50.840> end<00:04:50.990> right<00:04:51.350> here<00:04:51.650> they<00:04:52.100> peel<00:04:52.430> off

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
gets to the end right here they peel off

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:56.560 
gets to the end right here they peel off
and<00:04:53.030> so<00:04:54.280> my<00:04:55.280> end<00:04:55.700> up<00:04:55.850> having<00:04:56.120> to<00:04:56.210> cut<00:04:56.360> my<00:04:56.510> nails

when<00:05:56.060> i<00:05:56.150> buy<00:05:56.360> white<00:05:56.630> nail<00:05:56.840> polishes<00:05:57.500> they

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 
when i buy white nail polishes they

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.340 
when i buy white nail polishes they
thicken<00:05:58.490> up<00:05:58.700> really<00:05:59.090> fast<00:05:59.360> what<00:06:00.080> ends<00:06:00.290> up

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:00.350 
thicken up really fast what ends up

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:01.719 
thicken up really fast what ends up
happening<00:06:00.410> is<00:06:00.890> I<00:06:01.010> don't<00:06:01.070> even<00:06:01.370> get<00:06:01.580> through

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:01.729 
happening is I don't even get through

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:03.580 
happening is I don't even get through
the<00:06:01.850> entire<00:06:02.120> bottle<00:06:02.390> because<00:06:02.870> it<00:06:02.900> thickens<00:06:03.440> up

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:03.590 
the entire bottle because it thickens up

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.530 
the entire bottle because it thickens up
so<00:06:03.770> much<00:06:03.950> I<00:06:04.160> can't<00:06:04.400> use<00:06:04.610> it<00:06:04.790> it<00:06:05.120> gets<00:06:05.360> to<00:06:05.450> the

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:05.540 
so much I can't use it it gets to the

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.510 
so much I can't use it it gets to the
point<00:06:05.780> where<00:06:05.900> I<00:06:06.020> have<00:06:06.350> to<00:06:06.380> shake<00:06:07.070> it<00:06:07.100> in

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 
point where I have to shake it in

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.000 
point where I have to shake it in
between<00:06:07.790> of<00:06:08.150> each<00:06:08.360> nail<00:06:08.690> for<00:06:09.380> it<00:06:09.470> even<00:06:09.680> to

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.010 
between of each nail for it even to

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.250 
between of each nail for it even to
spread<00:06:10.430> and<00:06:10.700> then<00:06:10.850> probably<00:06:11.690> about<00:06:11.960> a<00:06:12.020> third

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:12.260 
spread and then probably about a third

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.600 
spread and then probably about a third
or<00:06:12.410> way<00:06:12.500> through<00:06:12.740> the<00:06:12.830> bottle<00:06:13.160> I<00:06:13.280> have<00:06:13.490> to

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610

one of these

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.590 
one of these
and<00:06:24.600> I<00:06:24.840> put<00:06:25.110> it<00:06:25.200> on<00:06:25.260> today<00:06:25.440> so<00:06:26.340> far<00:06:26.370> so<00:06:27.060> good<00:06:27.090> of

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 
and I put it on today so far so good of

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.390 
and I put it on today so far so good of
course<00:06:27.930> is<00:06:28.080> the<00:06:28.260> first<00:06:28.500> use<00:06:28.800> and<00:06:29.040> usually

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 
course is the first use and usually

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.910 
course is the first use and usually
they're<00:06:29.610> always<00:06:29.790> okay<00:06:30.450> but<00:06:30.660> then<00:06:30.900> over<00:06:31.080> time<00:06:31.500> I

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:31.920 
they're always okay but then over time I

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.550 
they're always okay but then over time I
think<00:06:32.310> um<00:06:32.880> the<00:06:33.300> oxidation<00:06:33.810> kind<00:06:34.260> of<00:06:34.380> makes

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 
think um the oxidation kind of makes

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.450 
think um the oxidation kind of makes
them<00:06:34.770> harder<00:06:35.270> if<00:06:36.270> you<00:06:36.330> guys<00:06:36.600> have<00:06:36.900> a<00:06:36.930> white<00:06:37.460> if
