00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
your body is fighting off something more

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.700 
your body is fighting off something more
serious<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:12.270> already<00:01:12.690> takes<00:01:13.050> up<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.500> lot

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
serious and that already takes up a lot

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.310 
serious and that already takes up a lot
of<00:01:13.740> its<00:01:14.070> resources<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:15.119> if<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.600> then<00:01:15.840> go<00:01:16.080> and

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
of its resources and if you then go and

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.580 
of its resources and if you then go and
pile<00:01:16.619> more<00:01:16.920> stress<00:01:17.369> on<00:01:17.580> top<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.530> by<00:01:19.530> doing

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
pile more stress on top of that by doing

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.490 
pile more stress on top of that by doing
the<00:01:19.979> workout<00:01:20.460> which<00:01:21.270> heats<00:01:21.899> your<00:01:22.080> body<00:01:22.290> up

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
even more then that may mean that you

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.180 
even more then that may mean that you
simply<00:01:26.060> delay<00:01:27.060> your<00:01:27.450> body's<00:01:27.930> ability<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.860> cure

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
itself and in the long run you might

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.060 
itself and in the long run you might
miss<00:01:32.250> more<00:01:32.909> workouts<00:01:33.479> than<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.259> would<00:01:34.500> if<00:01:34.710> you

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
miss more workouts than you would if you

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.300 
miss more workouts than you would if you
simply<00:01:35.970> left<00:01:36.539> out<00:01:36.750> one<00:01:37.110> or<00:01:37.259> two<00:01:37.440> sessions<00:01:37.770> and

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
simply left out one or two sessions and

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.600 
simply left out one or two sessions and
give<00:01:38.640> your<00:01:38.880> body<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.420> chance<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.920> sort<00:01:41.280> itself

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
give your body a chance to sort itself

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:48.160 
give your body a chance to sort itself
out

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170

take<00:01:51.470> an<00:01:51.590> aspirin<00:01:51.979> and<00:01:52.189> then<00:01:52.549> I<00:01:52.640> won't<00:01:52.850> have

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
take an aspirin and then I won't have

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.410 
take an aspirin and then I won't have
fever<00:01:53.330> so<00:01:53.900> I<00:01:53.930> can<00:01:54.170> work<00:01:54.290> out<00:01:54.560> but<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:55.939> aspirin

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
fever so I can work out but the aspirin

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.870

fever<00:01:59.090> and<00:01:59.390> feeling<00:01:59.750> ill<00:01:59.990> is<00:02:00.170> just<00:02:00.939> masking

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
fever and feeling ill is just masking

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.840 
fever and feeling ill is just masking
the<00:02:02.540> symptoms<00:02:03.049> of<00:02:03.500> your<00:02:03.860> illness<00:02:04.009> and<00:02:04.460> your

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
the symptoms of your illness and your

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.380 
the symptoms of your illness and your
buddy<00:02:05.060> still<00:02:05.450> is<00:02:05.840> ill<00:02:06.320> so<00:02:06.560> if<00:02:07.369> you<00:02:07.789> take<00:02:08.149> a

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
buddy still is ill so if you take a

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.930 
buddy still is ill so if you take a
medication<00:02:08.989> against<00:02:09.950> the<00:02:10.039> symptoms<00:02:10.489> don't

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
medication against the symptoms don't

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.270 
medication against the symptoms don't
think<00:02:11.270> that<00:02:11.450> your<00:02:11.630> body<00:02:11.840> is<00:02:12.050> back<00:02:12.350> to<00:02:12.560> 100%

think that your body is back to 100%

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.090 
think that your body is back to 100%
just<00:02:13.940> because<00:02:14.300> you<00:02:14.510> don't<00:02:14.690> feel<00:02:15.319> as<00:02:15.590> ill<00:02:15.860> as

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
just because you don't feel as ill as

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:24.720 
just because you don't feel as ill as
you<00:02:16.700> did<00:02:16.910> before<00:02:17.180> you<00:02:17.510> took<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:18.230> medication

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.880 

now<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.599> best<00:02:25.810> thing<00:02:25.930> of<00:02:26.140> course<00:02:26.319> is<00:02:26.409> to<00:02:26.769> not

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
now the best thing of course is to not

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.830 
now the best thing of course is to not
get<00:02:27.069> your<00:02:27.250> cold<00:02:27.430> in<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:27.700> first<00:02:27.940> place<00:02:28.180> because

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
get your cold in the first place because

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.570 
get your cold in the first place because
if<00:02:29.110> you<00:02:29.200> don't<00:02:29.319> have<00:02:29.560> a<00:02:29.590> cold<00:02:29.890> then<00:02:30.220> we<00:02:30.340> can<00:02:30.459> of

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
if you don't have a cold then we can of

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.280 
if you don't have a cold then we can of
course<00:02:30.610> work<00:02:31.090> out<00:02:31.330> to<00:02:31.480> our<00:02:31.629> hearts<00:02:32.080> content

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
course work out to our hearts content

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.070 
course work out to our hearts content
and<00:02:32.830> give<00:02:33.040> one<00:02:33.489> hundred<00:02:33.640> percent<00:02:33.849> and<00:02:34.569> there

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
and give one hundred percent and there

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.839 
and give one hundred percent and there
are<00:02:35.230> two<00:02:35.440> simple<00:02:35.799> things<00:02:35.830> you<00:02:36.129> can<00:02:36.220> do<00:02:36.519> to<00:02:36.549> make

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
are two simple things you can do to make

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.360 
are two simple things you can do to make
your<00:02:36.909> chances<00:02:37.750> of<00:02:37.900> not<00:02:37.959> catching<00:02:38.409> code<00:02:38.860> much

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
your chances of not catching code much

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.940 
your chances of not catching code much
higher<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:40.450> first<00:02:40.720> is<00:02:40.930> to<00:02:41.260> simply<00:02:41.560> get<00:02:41.680> enough

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
higher the first is to simply get enough

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.789 
higher the first is to simply get enough

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
very little and all they can really do

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:50.129 
very little and all they can really do
is<00:03:47.349> if<00:03:48.129> you<00:03:48.310> have<00:03:48.579> a<00:03:48.609> code<00:03:49.030> they<00:03:49.569> can<00:03:49.750> make<00:03:49.930> the

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
is if you have a code they can make the

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:53.490 
is if you have a code they can make the
symptoms<00:03:51.010> a<00:03:51.219> bit<00:03:51.489> less<00:03:52.120> severe<00:03:52.629> and<00:03:52.930> maybe

symptoms a bit less severe and maybe

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.360 
symptoms a bit less severe and maybe
make<00:03:54.340> them<00:03:54.370> last<00:03:54.790> a<00:03:55.780> little<00:03:56.290> less<00:03:56.769> long<00:03:57.340> than

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
make them last a little less long than

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.990 
make them last a little less long than
without<00:03:58.150> your<00:03:58.959> best<00:03:59.409> bet<00:03:59.560> is<00:03:59.950> still<00:04:00.010> getting

without your best bet is still getting
enough<00:04:01.329> sleep<00:04:01.569> and<00:04:02.010> washing<00:04:03.010> your<00:04:03.310> hands
