myself you can actually tell how thin

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.330 
myself you can actually tell how thin
the<00:00:51.539> beam<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:51.899> as<00:00:52.170> opposed<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.949> where<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.250> would

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
the beam is as opposed to where it would

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.750 
the beam is as opposed to where it would
be<00:00:53.370> at<00:00:53.520> this<00:00:53.640> point<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.449> can<00:00:54.570> see<00:00:54.750> there<00:00:55.760> and

them back into view there that's the

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.619 
them back into view there that's the
thinnest<00:00:59.699> point<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.030> beam<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.539> we're

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
thinnest point of the beam and we're

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:01.549 
thinnest point of the beam and we're
gonna<00:01:00.719> do<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:00.930> we're<00:01:01.020> just<00:01:01.050> gonna<00:01:01.199> pop<00:01:01.440> this

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
match here just by holding map that beam

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.539 
match here just by holding map that beam
steady<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.740> can<00:01:13.890> see<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.130> match<00:01:14.310> go

that match alright next things next is
we've<00:01:24.210> got<00:01:24.420> we've<00:01:24.869> got<00:01:24.990> ourselves<00:01:25.080> kind<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.470> an

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
we've got we've got ourselves kind of an

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.960 
we've got we've got ourselves kind of an
unfocused<00:01:25.860> beam<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.280> can<00:01:26.340> probably<00:01:26.580> see<00:01:26.820> that

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
unfocused beam you can probably see that

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.580 
unfocused beam you can probably see that
pretty<00:01:27.180> well<00:01:27.450> but<00:01:28.200> I'm<00:01:28.290> gonna<00:01:28.409> go<00:01:28.470> head<00:01:28.560> and

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
pretty well but I'm gonna go head and

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.859 
pretty well but I'm gonna go head and
bring<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:28.860> beam<00:01:29.009> into<00:01:29.220> focus<00:01:29.579> for<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.659> long

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
bring that beam into focus for a long

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.120 
bring that beam into focus for a long
distance<00:01:31.079> pop<00:01:31.560> right<00:01:31.740> there<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.950> can<00:01:32.040> see

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
distance pop right there you can see

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.380 
distance pop right there you can see
that<00:01:32.159> balloon<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.610> corner<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:32.970> gonna<00:01:33.119> be

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
that balloon in the corner is gonna be

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.749 
that balloon in the corner is gonna be
the<00:01:34.229> history<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.740> just<00:01:35.009> about<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.280> second<00:01:35.670> or

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
the history and just about a second or

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.450 
the history and just about a second or
so<00:01:39.590> and<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.710> course<00:01:40.920> we're<00:01:41.100> we<00:01:41.220> be<00:01:41.340> without

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
so and of course we're we be without

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.060 
so and of course we're we be without
beam<00:01:41.759> shots<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.299> course<00:01:42.710> go<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.890> bring<00:01:43.979> a

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
beam shots of course go and bring a

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.649 
beam shots of course go and bring a
laser<00:01:44.250> into<00:01:44.520> semi<00:01:44.880> focus<00:01:45.210> here<00:01:45.360> but<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.540> can

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
laser into semi focus here but you can

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.710 
laser into semi focus here but you can
actually<00:01:45.780> see<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.710> this<00:01:47.159> dot<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:48.479> what<00:01:48.630> it

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
actually see this this dot and what it

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.499 
actually see this this dot and what it
looks<00:01:48.810> like<00:01:48.990> from<00:01:49.110> here<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.530> roughly<00:01:50.509> two

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
looks like from here is roughly two

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.050 
looks like from here is roughly two
millimeters<00:01:52.049> across<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.850> we're<00:01:53.850> getting<00:01:53.939> a

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
millimeters across and we're getting a

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.240 
millimeters across and we're getting a
pretty<00:01:54.180> good<00:01:54.329> pretty<00:01:55.320> good<00:01:55.439> bright<00:01:55.799> beam<00:01:56.070> on

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
pretty good pretty good bright beam on

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.700 
pretty good pretty good bright beam on
it<00:01:56.369> as<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.490> fresh<00:01:56.820> battery<00:01:57.090> fresh<00:01:57.420> 18<00:01:57.810> v<00:01:57.990> 6<00:01:58.170> 18

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
it as a fresh battery fresh 18 v 6 18

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.310 
it as a fresh battery fresh 18 v 6 18
650<00:01:59.040> so<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.399> put<00:01:59.700> in<00:01:59.790> there<00:01:59.960> but<00:02:00.960> that's<00:02:01.140> what

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
650 so I put in there but that's what

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.709 
650 so I put in there but that's what
this<00:02:01.439> is<00:02:01.500> looking<00:02:01.860> like<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.420> you<00:02:03.420> can<00:02:03.570> see

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
this is looking like and you can see

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.190 
this is looking like and you can see
pretty<00:02:04.530> clearly<00:02:04.770> it's<00:02:05.100> very<00:02:06.000> bright<00:02:06.990> beam

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
pretty clearly it's very bright beam

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.970 
pretty clearly it's very bright beam
very<00:02:07.409> bright<00:02:07.710> cool<00:02:08.310> blue

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.520 

okay<00:02:12.980> here's<00:02:13.190> my<00:02:13.340> messy<00:02:13.730> desk<00:02:14.230> and<00:02:15.230> this<00:02:15.410> is

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
okay here's my messy desk and this is

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.840 
okay here's my messy desk and this is
the<00:02:15.620> last<00:02:15.800> bit<00:02:16.100> of<00:02:16.130> the<00:02:16.250> demonstration<00:02:16.760> we're

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
the last bit of the demonstration we're

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:17.800 
the last bit of the demonstration we're
going<00:02:16.880> to<00:02:17.000> do<00:02:17.090> here<00:02:17.270> but<00:02:17.330> I'm<00:02:17.420> willing<00:02:17.630> to<00:02:17.720> do

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
going to do here but I'm willing to do

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.420 
going to do here but I'm willing to do
is<00:02:17.900> I'm<00:02:17.960> just<00:02:17.990> going<00:02:18.170> to<00:02:18.230> cut<00:02:18.470> a<00:02:18.710> piece<00:02:19.220> of

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
is I'm just going to cut a piece of

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.200 
is I'm just going to cut a piece of
plain<00:02:20.030> old<00:02:20.590> electrical<00:02:21.590> tape<00:02:22.000> pretty<00:02:23.000> quickly

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
plain old electrical tape pretty quickly

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.640 
plain old electrical tape pretty quickly
with<00:02:23.450> this<00:02:23.510> beam<00:02:23.750> as<00:02:24.170> soon<00:02:24.290> as<00:02:24.350> they<00:02:24.410> turn<00:02:24.560> it

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
with this beam as soon as they turn it

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.580 
with this beam as soon as they turn it
on<00:02:24.740> of<00:02:24.920> course<00:02:25.990> works<00:02:26.990> best<00:02:27.170> when<00:02:27.320> it's<00:02:27.470> turned

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
on of course works best when it's turned

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:37.090 
on of course works best when it's turned
on<00:02:28.240> and<00:02:29.240> here<00:02:29.570> we<00:02:29.720> are<00:02:34.690> all<00:02:35.690> right<00:02:36.020> so<00:02:36.920> you<00:02:37.010> guys

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
yourself a couple parts make a laser if

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.680 
yourself a couple parts make a laser if
not<00:02:42.560> don't<00:02:43.010> care<00:02:43.340> I<00:02:43.580> wanted<00:02:44.300> to<00:02:44.360> do<00:02:44.480> it<00:02:44.600> anyway
