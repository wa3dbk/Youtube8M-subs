day<00:02:48.690> but<00:02:49.500> i<00:02:49.530> decided<00:02:49.890> against<00:02:50.400> it<00:02:50.490> just<00:02:51.450> like

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
day but i decided against it just like

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.870 
day but i decided against it just like
my<00:02:51.750> last<00:02:51.990> review<00:02:52.200> on<00:02:52.440> dark<00:02:52.650> tranquillity<00:02:53.280> this

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
my last review on dark tranquillity this

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.500 
my last review on dark tranquillity this
is<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.180> CD<00:02:54.510> that<00:02:54.930> grows<00:02:55.170> on<00:02:55.880> at<00:02:56.880> the<00:02:57.030> moment<00:02:57.150> I

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
is the CD that grows on at the moment I

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.900 
is the CD that grows on at the moment I
think<00:02:57.810> it's<00:02:57.960> a<00:02:58.170> very<00:02:58.530> good<00:02:58.680> CD<00:02:59.160> there's<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.880> lot

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
think it's a very good CD there's a lot

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.750 
think it's a very good CD there's a lot
of<00:03:00.060> good<00:03:00.270> songs<00:03:00.510> on<00:03:00.720> here<00:03:00.930> is<00:03:01.020> very<00:03:01.260> solid<00:03:01.760> it's

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
of good songs on here is very solid it's

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.760 
of good songs on here is very solid it's
another<00:03:02.910> Kalos<00:03:03.240> CD<00:03:03.660> and<00:03:03.990> they<00:03:04.470> built<00:03:04.680> this

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
another Kalos CD and they built this

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.900 
another Kalos CD and they built this
point<00:03:05.130> that's<00:03:05.430> for<00:03:05.640> damn<00:03:05.790> sure

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.300 

I<00:03:07.970> don't<00:03:08.840> think<00:03:08.930> it's<00:03:09.170> as<00:03:09.320> good<00:03:09.500> as<00:03:09.860> the

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
I don't think it's as good as the

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.820 
I don't think it's as good as the
previous<00:03:10.580> work<00:03:11.000> but<00:03:11.630> that's<00:03:11.900> a<00:03:11.990> lot<00:03:12.200> to<00:03:12.410> say

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
previous work but that's a lot to say

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.170 
previous work but that's a lot to say
about<00:03:12.860> these<00:03:13.160> guys<00:03:13.370> because<00:03:13.610> their<00:03:13.820> previous

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
about these guys because their previous

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.750 
about these guys because their previous
workers<00:03:14.540> for<00:03:14.810> Gaza<00:03:15.340> they're<00:03:16.340> kind<00:03:16.520> of<00:03:16.550> moving

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
workers for Gaza they're kind of moving

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.290 
workers for Gaza they're kind of moving
into<00:03:17.300> a<00:03:17.330> heavier<00:03:17.990> darker<00:03:18.680> approach<00:03:19.300> whereas

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
into a heavier darker approach whereas

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.190 
into a heavier darker approach whereas
that<00:03:20.660> older<00:03:20.930> stuff<00:03:21.140> is<00:03:21.290> more<00:03:21.440> melodic<00:03:21.800> and

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
that older stuff is more melodic and

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.110 
that older stuff is more melodic and
I<00:03:23.440> was<00:03:23.860> in<00:03:24.040> catchy

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
I was in catchy

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.870 
I was in catchy
it's<00:03:25.540> a<00:03:25.569> little<00:03:25.780> different

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
it's a little different

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.110
