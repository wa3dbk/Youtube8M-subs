hey what's up everybody today is July

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.880 
hey what's up everybody today is July
the<00:00:04.670> 14th<00:00:05.670> and<00:00:06.000> it<00:00:06.420> has<00:00:06.629> been<00:00:06.899> two<00:00:07.230> weeks<00:00:07.259> since

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
the 14th and it has been two weeks since

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.629 
the 14th and it has been two weeks since
I<00:00:08.700> started<00:00:08.970> my<00:00:09.240> project<00:00:09.710> so<00:00:10.710> initially<00:00:11.280> this

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
I started my project so initially this

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.580 
I started my project so initially this
plant<00:00:11.969> didn't<00:00:12.269> want<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.509> grow<00:00:12.690> so<00:00:13.230> I<00:00:13.259> took<00:00:13.349> it

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
plant didn't want to grow so I took it

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.620 
plant didn't want to grow so I took it
out<00:00:13.799> of<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.009> dirt<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.460> then<00:00:14.940> I<00:00:15.089> placed<00:00:15.389> it

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
out of the dirt and then I placed it

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.050 
out of the dirt and then I placed it
into<00:00:15.780> this<00:00:16.049> container<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.830> now<00:00:17.580> here's<00:00:17.850> 2

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
into this container and now here's 2

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.880 
into this container and now here's 2
weeks<00:00:18.270> later<00:00:18.539> so<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.140> leaves<00:00:19.439> are<00:00:19.740> starting

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
weeks later so the leaves are starting

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.290 
weeks later so the leaves are starting
to<00:00:20.100> grow<00:00:20.310> so<00:00:21.000> it's<00:00:21.480> it's<00:00:21.750> it's<00:00:22.109> really<00:00:22.380> working

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
to grow so it's it's it's really working

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.450 
to grow so it's it's it's really working
the<00:00:24.300> these<00:00:24.750> here<00:00:25.080> were<00:00:25.470> really<00:00:25.859> tiny<00:00:26.130> leaves

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
the these here were really tiny leaves

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.429 
the these here were really tiny leaves
and<00:00:26.730> now<00:00:26.820> look<00:00:27.570> at<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.720> size<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:28.080> these<00:00:28.199> now

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
and now look at the size of these now

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.189 
and now look at the size of these now
after<00:00:28.859> two<00:00:29.039> weeks<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.580> so<00:00:30.390> in<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.869> few<00:00:31.080> more

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
after two weeks and so in a few more

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.139 
after two weeks and so in a few more
weeks<00:00:31.380> they<00:00:31.560> would<00:00:31.679> be<00:00:31.830> much<00:00:32.130> much<00:00:32.430> bigger<00:00:32.669> so

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
weeks they would be much much bigger so

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.240 
weeks they would be much much bigger so
it's<00:00:34.050> really<00:00:34.380> what<00:00:34.590> you're<00:00:34.710> working<00:00:35.100> really

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
it's really what you're working really

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.049 
it's really what you're working really
well<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.960> then<00:00:36.960> my<00:00:37.260> other<00:00:37.530> plant<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.430> larger

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
well and then my other plant the larger

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.080 
well and then my other plant the larger
hydroponic<00:00:39.750> one<00:00:39.899> this<00:00:40.829> one<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.309> really<00:00:41.700> really

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
hydroponic one this one is really really

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.350 
hydroponic one this one is really really
nice<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.989> it's<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.100> gotten<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.610> size<00:00:44.940> where

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
nice and it's the gotten to a size where

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.430 
nice and it's the gotten to a size where
it<00:00:46.050> started<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.500> develop<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:47.399> Y<00:00:48.300> shape<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.170> then

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
it started to develop a Y shape and then

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.360 
it started to develop a Y shape and then
fruits<00:00:50.280> has<00:00:50.700> started<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.559> to<00:00:52.559> form<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:53.070> fruit

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
fruits has started to to form that fruit

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.209 
fruits has started to to form that fruit
but<00:00:53.610> flowers<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.329> there<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.660> right<00:00:54.840> there

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
but flowers so there it is right there

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.310 
but flowers so there it is right there
so<00:00:56.219> what<00:00:56.309> I'm<00:00:56.430> gonna<00:00:56.550> do<00:00:56.789> now<00:00:56.969> for<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:58.020> is

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
so what I'm gonna do now for this is

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.950 
so what I'm gonna do now for this is
because<00:00:58.680> I'm<00:00:58.829> not<00:00:58.980> ready<00:00:59.250> for<00:00:59.340> these<00:00:59.670> two<00:01:00.030> two

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
because I'm not ready for these two two

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.080 
because I'm not ready for these two two
fruit<00:01:01.260> yet<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:02.250> I'm<00:01:02.399> gonna<00:01:02.539> top<00:01:03.539> this<00:01:03.809> off<00:01:05.090> so

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
fruit yet so I'm gonna top this off so

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.850 
fruit yet so I'm gonna top this off so
what<00:01:06.240> I'm<00:01:06.330> going<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.479> do<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:07.020> I'm<00:01:07.229> going<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.439> cut

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to cut

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:15.560 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to cut
whether<00:01:08.700> Y<00:01:09.049> starts<00:01:10.049> off<00:01:11.180> and<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:13.170> way<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:14.570> it

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
whether Y starts off and that way and it

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.480 
whether Y starts off and that way and it
doesn't<00:01:15.840> flower<00:01:16.200> too<00:01:16.500> early<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.040> now<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.189> have

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
doesn't flower too early and now I have

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.050 
doesn't flower too early and now I have
more<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.869> side<00:01:19.140> shoots<00:01:19.470> grow<00:01:20.040> out<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.549> and

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
more of the side shoots grow out and and

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.240 
more of the side shoots grow out and and
what<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:22.020> would<00:01:22.259> become<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.799> bush<00:01:23.040> here

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
what this would become a bush here

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.840 
what this would become a bush here
plants<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:24.600> here<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.560> what<00:01:25.950> I'm<00:01:26.040> gonna<00:01:26.159> do<00:01:26.400> you

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
plants so here is what I'm gonna do you

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.300 
plants so here is what I'm gonna do you
can<00:01:26.970> use<00:01:27.119> my<00:01:27.299> scissor<00:01:29.659> and<00:01:30.799> you<00:01:31.799> find<00:01:32.220> a

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
can use my scissor and you find a

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:45.649 
can use my scissor and you find a
perfect<00:01:32.610> angle<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.150> cut<00:01:33.450> this

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:56.860 

so<00:01:46.200> cut<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:46.530> right<00:01:46.710> run<00:01:47.159> right<00:01:47.400> there

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:56.870 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.180 

so<00:01:57.870> I'm<00:01:57.930> doing<00:01:58.110> this<00:01:58.290> with<00:01:58.470> one<00:01:58.620> hand<00:01:58.860> so<00:01:58.979> it's

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
so I'm doing this with one hand so it's

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:07.410 
so I'm doing this with one hand so it's
kind<00:01:59.370> of<00:01:59.400> difficult<00:02:01.430> there<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.520> go

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.559 

so<00:02:07.960> this<00:02:08.110> is<00:02:08.259> how<00:02:08.470> much<00:02:08.649> we<00:02:09.490> took<00:02:09.640> off<00:02:10.650> and

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
so this is how much we took off and

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.390 
so this is how much we took off and
that's<00:02:13.569> where<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:13.900> wife<00:02:14.110> starts<00:02:14.770> with<00:02:15.190> the

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
that's where the wife starts with the

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.780 
that's where the wife starts with the
fruit<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:15.850> stuff<00:02:16.530> so<00:02:17.530> hopefully<00:02:17.709> when<00:02:18.100> this

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
fruit and stuff so hopefully when this

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.750 
fruit and stuff so hopefully when this
grow<00:02:19.090> back<00:02:19.360> it<00:02:20.290> would<00:02:20.500> become<00:02:20.980> a<00:02:21.190> bushier

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
grow back it would become a bushier

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.699 
grow back it would become a bushier
plant<00:02:22.060> so<00:02:22.450> I'm<00:02:22.690> trying<00:02:22.959> to<00:02:22.990> keep<00:02:23.200> this<00:02:23.350> as<00:02:23.530> low

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
plant so I'm trying to keep this as low

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.470 
plant so I'm trying to keep this as low
as<00:02:23.890> possible<00:02:23.950> so<00:02:24.520> I'm<00:02:24.580> going<00:02:24.730> to<00:02:24.790> stop<00:02:25.000> pruning

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
as possible so I'm going to stop pruning

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.690 
as possible so I'm going to stop pruning
this<00:02:25.600> really<00:02:25.959> aggressively<00:02:26.560> so<00:02:27.400> that<00:02:27.550> it

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
this really aggressively so that it

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.160 
this really aggressively so that it
would<00:02:27.850> become<00:02:28.000> a<00:02:28.120> smaller<00:02:28.510> plant<00:02:28.840> just<00:02:29.050> like

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
would become a smaller plant just like

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.940 
would become a smaller plant just like
that<00:02:29.470> one<00:02:29.590> there<00:02:29.770> but<00:02:30.640> anyway<00:02:30.910> that's<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.950> the

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
that one there but anyway that's the the

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.070 
that one there but anyway that's the the
first<00:02:33.190> update<00:02:33.400> after<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.180> initial

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
first update after the initial
