00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
anyway let's say I get on to it and this

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.299 
anyway let's say I get on to it and this
special<00:00:48.480> I'll<00:00:48.629> show<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.530> sin<00:00:49.829> generator

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
special I'll show you the sin generator

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.160 
special I'll show you the sin generator
and<00:00:50.820> I'm<00:00:50.910> sure<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.239> have<00:00:51.390> seen<00:00:51.570> other<00:00:51.780> scent

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
and I'm sure you have seen other scent

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.660 
and I'm sure you have seen other scent
generators<00:00:53.210> basically<00:00:54.210> where<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:55.070> saw<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.100> was

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
generators basically where I saw it was

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.319 
generators basically where I saw it was
on<00:00:56.940> statics<00:00:57.480> Channel<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:58.079> believe<00:00:59.270> I'm<00:01:00.270> not

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
on statics Channel I believe I'm not

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.330 
on statics Channel I believe I'm not
eternally<00:01:01.020> sure<00:01:01.199> though<00:01:01.379> it's<00:01:01.620> quite<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.190> long

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
eternally sure though it's quite a long

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.789 
eternally sure though it's quite a long
time<00:01:02.520> ago<00:01:03.120> now<00:01:03.710> and<00:01:05.659> you<00:01:06.659> don't<00:01:06.840> activate<00:01:07.650> it

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
time ago now and you don't activate it

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.899 
time ago now and you don't activate it
like<00:01:07.920> that

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.389 

as<00:01:12.909> you<00:01:13.060> can<00:01:13.210> see<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:14.590> works<00:01:14.829> just<00:01:14.979> fine

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
as you can see it works just fine

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:19.770 
as you can see it works just fine
produces<00:01:16.179> sand<00:01:16.420> butts<00:01:17.789> and<00:01:18.789> I<00:01:19.210> have<00:01:19.600> become

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
produces sand butts and I have become

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.910 
produces sand butts and I have become
quite<00:01:20.590> the<00:01:21.210> geek<00:01:22.210> when<00:01:22.899> it<00:01:23.020> comes<00:01:23.229> to<00:01:23.409> redstone

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
quite the geek when it comes to redstone

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.539 
quite the geek when it comes to redstone
and<00:01:25.110> it's<00:01:26.110> very<00:01:26.319> important<00:01:26.890> to<00:01:27.039> me<00:01:27.159> that<00:01:27.189> if

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
and it's very important to me that if

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:29.100 
and it's very important to me that if
you<00:01:27.670> can<00:01:27.850> automate<00:01:28.209> something<00:01:28.569> that<00:01:28.990> you

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
you can automate something that you

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.330 
you can automate something that you
automate<00:01:29.590> it<00:01:29.709> and<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:32.170> took<00:01:32.409> me<00:01:32.469> quite<00:01:33.069> a<00:01:33.189> while

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
automate it and it took me quite a while

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.550 
automate it and it took me quite a while
it's<00:01:34.060> actually<00:01:34.479> an<00:01:34.569> old<00:01:34.659> project<00:01:34.929> something<00:01:35.500> I

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
it's actually an old project something I

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.789 
it's actually an old project something I
completed<00:01:36.009> a<00:01:36.100> long<00:01:36.219> time<00:01:36.459> ago<00:01:37.469> and<00:01:38.469> didn't

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
completed a long time ago and didn't

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:39.959 
completed a long time ago and didn't
know<00:01:38.920> if<00:01:39.100> I<00:01:39.189> was<00:01:39.340> gonna<00:01:39.490> share<00:01:39.759> with<00:01:39.909> you

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:39.969 
know if I was gonna share with you

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:41.370 
know if I was gonna share with you
because<00:01:40.240> I<00:01:40.509> knew<00:01:40.630> other<00:01:40.780> people<00:01:40.899> had<00:01:41.200> done

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
because I knew other people had done

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.979 
because I knew other people had done
sent<00:01:42.099> generators<00:01:42.610> but<00:01:43.299> I<00:01:43.329> haven't<00:01:43.659> seen<00:01:43.840> one

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:43.989 
sent generators but I haven't seen one

00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:47.459 
sent generators but I haven't seen one
who<00:01:44.110> has<00:01:44.229> done<00:01:44.380> one<00:01:44.590> that's<00:01:46.049> come<00:01:47.049> on

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:47.469 
who has done one that's come on

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:54.979 
who has done one that's come on
alright<00:01:48.369> I<00:01:48.520> gotta<00:01:48.759> turn<00:01:48.969> it<00:01:49.090> off<00:01:49.209> there<00:01:49.450> I

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:54.989 

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:57.779 

haven't<00:01:55.989> seen<00:01:56.140> anyone<00:01:56.409> who<00:01:56.770> has<00:01:56.799> made<00:01:57.189> it<00:01:57.429> also

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 
haven't seen anyone who has made it also

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:01.109 
haven't seen anyone who has made it also
married<00:01:58.119> yet<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:59.469> actually<00:02:00.399> this<00:02:00.610> discovery

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
married yet and actually this discovery

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.869 
married yet and actually this discovery
or<00:02:01.420> invention<00:02:02.009> happened<00:02:03.009> sort<00:02:03.729> of

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:03.879 
or invention happened sort of

00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:07.639 
or invention happened sort of
accidentally<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:06.369> what<00:02:06.520> I<00:02:06.549> mean<00:02:06.759> by<00:02:06.909> that<00:02:06.939> is

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
accidentally and what I mean by that is

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.690 
accidentally and what I mean by that is
even<00:02:08.649> though<00:02:08.799> this<00:02:09.009> works

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
even though this works

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.440 
even though this works
I<00:02:09.819> cannot<00:02:10.470> completely<00:02:11.790> describe<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:12.819> reason

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
I cannot completely describe the reason

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.830 
I cannot completely describe the reason
to<00:02:13.690> you<00:02:14.200> as<00:02:14.560> of<00:02:15.040> why<00:02:15.310> that's<00:02:15.579> the<00:02:16.239> case<00:02:16.269> I<00:02:16.810> don't

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
to you as of why that's the case I don't

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.129 
to you as of why that's the case I don't
know<00:02:17.459> really<00:02:18.459> but<00:02:19.389> we'll<00:02:19.569> get<00:02:19.810> to<00:02:20.019> the

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:20.139 
know really but we'll get to the

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:22.289 
know really but we'll get to the
circuitry<00:02:20.560> in<00:02:20.680> a<00:02:20.739> moments<00:02:21.069> then<00:02:22.000> I<00:02:22.030> made

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
circuitry in a moments then I made

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:23.729 
circuitry in a moments then I made
another<00:02:22.540> one<00:02:22.660> here<00:02:23.019> this<00:02:23.260> was<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.470> next

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
another one here this was the next

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.539 
another one here this was the next
generation<00:02:23.920> one<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:27.040> only<00:02:27.190> thing<00:02:27.400> that's

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
generation one and the only thing that's

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:28.860 
generation one and the only thing that's
really<00:02:27.670> different<00:02:27.760> between<00:02:28.239> this<00:02:28.480> and<00:02:28.720> that

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
really different between this and that

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.170 
really different between this and that
is<00:02:29.109> this<00:02:29.440> is<00:02:29.560> more<00:02:29.739> neatly<00:02:29.950> packed<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:30.849> it<00:02:31.030> has

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
is this is more neatly packed and it has

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.020 
is this is more neatly packed and it has
ice<00:02:31.389> beneath<00:02:31.630> it<00:02:31.870> and<00:02:32.380> then<00:02:33.069> there's<00:02:33.340> this<00:02:33.549> and

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
ice beneath it and then there's this and

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.670 
ice beneath it and then there's this and
this<00:02:34.209> is<00:02:34.359> the<00:02:34.450> one<00:02:34.599> I'm<00:02:34.750> planning<00:02:35.139> on<00:02:35.200> making<00:02:35.410> a

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
this is the one I'm planning on making a

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.470 
this is the one I'm planning on making a
schematic<00:02:36.010> off<00:02:36.280> for<00:02:36.700> you<00:02:36.819> guys<00:02:37.000> so<00:02:37.329> you<00:02:37.420> can

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
schematic off for you guys so you can

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.670 
schematic off for you guys so you can
download<00:02:37.780> and<00:02:38.169> play<00:02:38.500> with<00:02:38.889> it<00:02:39.160> yourself<00:02:40.680> but

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
download and play with it yourself but

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.099 
download and play with it yourself but
there<00:02:41.950> I'll<00:02:42.280> show<00:02:42.310> you<00:02:42.549> the<00:02:42.790> settings<00:02:43.109> right

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:44.109 
there I'll show you the settings right

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:47.550 
there I'll show you the settings right
now<00:02:44.290> actually<00:02:44.760> first<00:02:45.760> you<00:02:46.150> make<00:02:46.359> a<00:02:46.599> lever<00:02:47.169> you

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
now actually first you make a lever you

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.009 
now actually first you make a lever you
know<00:02:48.130> power<00:02:48.370> of<00:02:48.700> redstone<00:02:49.239> wire<00:02:49.480> and<00:02:49.840> that's

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
know power of redstone wire and that's

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.020 
know power of redstone wire and that's
the<00:02:50.139> one<00:02:50.290> you<00:02:50.410> see<00:02:50.590> here<00:02:50.620> going<00:02:51.190> behind<00:02:51.370> in

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
the one you see here going behind in

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.620 
the one you see here going behind in
there<00:02:52.389> underneath<00:02:53.109> the<00:02:53.440> whole<00:02:53.560> thing<00:02:53.769> and

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
there underneath the whole thing and

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.020 
there underneath the whole thing and
that<00:02:55.630> goes<00:02:55.930> to<00:02:55.959> this<00:02:56.440> piston<00:02:56.709> which<00:02:57.519> when

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
that goes to this piston which when

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.000 
that goes to this piston which when
you're<00:02:58.150> activated<00:02:58.599> by<00:02:58.959> flipping<00:02:59.230> this<00:02:59.470> the

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
you're activated by flipping this the

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.819 
you're activated by flipping this the
lever<00:03:00.660> it<00:03:01.660> pushes<00:03:02.109> this<00:03:02.290> block<00:03:02.560> down

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
lever it pushes this block down

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:05.129 
lever it pushes this block down
completing<00:03:03.669> the<00:03:03.849> circuit<00:03:04.269> here<00:03:04.540> which<00:03:04.780> starts

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:05.139 
completing the circuit here which starts

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:08.909 
completing the circuit here which starts
the<00:03:05.290> clock<00:03:06.299> and<00:03:07.299> then<00:03:07.540> you<00:03:07.780> basically<00:03:07.989> wire

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:08.919 
the clock and then you basically wire

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:12.720 
the clock and then you basically wire
all<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.730> outputs<00:03:10.209> which<00:03:11.109> is<00:03:11.349> all<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:11.769> what

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
all the outputs which is all the what

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.699 
all the outputs which is all the what
they<00:03:12.849> call<00:03:13.000> repeaters<00:03:13.480> now<00:03:14.079> see<00:03:14.290> I<00:03:14.319> have<00:03:14.620> an

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
they call repeaters now see I have an

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.520 
they call repeaters now see I have an
output<00:03:14.859> there<00:03:15.340> and<00:03:15.760> I'll<00:03:16.389> put<00:03:16.690> there<00:03:17.049> and<00:03:17.409> up

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
output there and I'll put there and up

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.210 
output there and I'll put there and up
with<00:03:17.709> their<00:03:17.950> in<00:03:18.099> and<00:03:18.219> up<00:03:18.340> with<00:03:18.549> their

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
with their in and up with their

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.250 
with their in and up with their
you<00:03:19.820> put<00:03:20.090> all<00:03:20.270> of<00:03:20.300> those<00:03:20.570> except<00:03:21.050> for<00:03:21.200> the

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
you put all of those except for the

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.230 
you put all of those except for the
middle<00:03:21.410> one<00:03:21.530> this<00:03:22.010> one<00:03:22.310> will<00:03:22.520> go<00:03:22.700> straight

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240 
middle one this one will go straight

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.390 
middle one this one will go straight
along<00:03:23.420> the<00:03:23.690> line<00:03:23.840> off<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:24.380> pistons<00:03:24.770> here<00:03:24.920> you

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
along the line off the pistons here you

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.580 
along the line off the pistons here you
don't<00:03:25.640> put<00:03:25.790> any<00:03:25.970> extra<00:03:26.270> Peters<00:03:26.660> there<00:03:26.900> but<00:03:27.440> the

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
don't put any extra Peters there but the

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.470 
don't put any extra Peters there but the
rest<00:03:27.830> of<00:03:27.920> them<00:03:28.070> you<00:03:28.400> put<00:03:28.640> two<00:03:28.850> repeaters<00:03:29.210> on

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
rest of them you put two repeaters on

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.310 
rest of them you put two repeaters on
once<00:03:30.320> it's<00:03:30.590> a<00:03:30.680> four<00:03:30.920> and<00:03:31.130> one<00:03:31.280> set<00:03:31.520> to<00:03:31.670> one<00:03:32.320> as

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
once it's a four and one set to one as

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.020 
once it's a four and one set to one as
you<00:03:33.410> can<00:03:33.470> see<00:03:33.770> there's<00:03:34.250> two<00:03:34.460> there<00:03:34.700> for<00:03:34.910> that

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
you can see there's two there for that

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.860 
you can see there's two there for that
output<00:03:35.450> and<00:03:35.570> two<00:03:36.350> therefore<00:03:37.510> this<00:03:38.510> up<00:03:38.720> for

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
output and two therefore this up for

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.270 
output and two therefore this up for
break<00:03:39.050> here

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
break here

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.150 
break here
and<00:03:40.880> then<00:03:41.060> you<00:03:41.180> said<00:03:41.360> all<00:03:41.600> that<00:03:42.050> you<00:03:42.650> can<00:03:42.890> set

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
and then you said all that you can set

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.840 
and then you said all that you can set
all<00:03:43.370> these<00:03:44.200> ticks<00:03:45.200> to<00:03:45.470> one<00:03:45.770> but<00:03:46.220> I<00:03:46.250> found<00:03:46.610> it's

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
all these ticks to one but I found it's

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.910 
all these ticks to one but I found it's
kind<00:03:47.090> of<00:03:47.180> delete<00:03:47.480> if<00:03:47.750> you<00:03:47.810> do<00:03:47.960> it<00:03:48.050> like<00:03:48.170> that

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
kind of delete if you do it like that

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.770 
kind of delete if you do it like that
and<00:03:49.250> this<00:03:49.460> one<00:03:49.640> always<00:03:49.850> has<00:03:50.150> to<00:03:50.270> remain<00:03:50.480> for

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
and this one always has to remain for

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.210 
and this one always has to remain for
keep<00:03:51.200> that<00:03:51.350> in<00:03:51.470> mind<00:03:51.650> by<00:03:51.830> the<00:03:51.860> way<00:03:51.950> the

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
keep that in mind by the way the

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.420 
keep that in mind by the way the
repeater<00:03:52.750> next<00:03:53.750> to<00:03:54.170> the<00:03:54.650> one<00:03:54.890> that<00:03:55.220> has<00:03:55.400> no

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
repeater next to the one that has no

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.120 
repeater next to the one that has no
extra<00:03:56.060> Peters<00:03:56.420> the<00:03:56.690> output<00:03:57.410> doesn't<00:03:57.890> have<00:03:57.980> any

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
extra Peters the output doesn't have any

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.880 
extra Peters the output doesn't have any
extra<00:03:58.520> Peters<00:03:59.150> always<00:03:59.750> get<00:04:00.080> a<00:04:00.110> bit<00:04:00.260> for<00:04:00.560> but<00:04:00.800> if

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
extra Peters always get a bit for but if

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.400 
extra Peters always get a bit for but if
you<00:04:00.980> set<00:04:01.160> them<00:04:01.250> all<00:04:01.459> to<00:04:01.490> four<00:04:01.910> it's<00:04:02.720> extremely

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
you set them all to four it's extremely

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.710 
you set them all to four it's extremely
reliable<00:04:03.800> if<00:04:04.430> they<00:04:04.640> actually<00:04:05.030> I<00:04:05.300> haven't

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
reliable if they actually I haven't

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.990 
reliable if they actually I haven't
experienced<00:04:06.410> it<00:04:06.530> glitching<00:04:07.100> yet<00:04:07.280> sometimes

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
experienced it glitching yet sometimes

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.560 
experienced it glitching yet sometimes
the<00:04:08.270> blocks<00:04:08.600> gets<00:04:08.870> stuck<00:04:09.320> underneath<00:04:09.920> these

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
the blocks gets stuck underneath these

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.650 
the blocks gets stuck underneath these
where<00:04:11.570> they<00:04:11.840> punch<00:04:12.230> down<00:04:13.070> the<00:04:13.100> st.<00:04:13.459> but<00:04:14.390> that's

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
where they punch down the st. but that's

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.390 
where they punch down the st. but that's
basically<00:04:14.930> the<00:04:15.410> only<00:04:15.530> problem<00:04:16.040> that<00:04:16.070> I<00:04:16.220> have

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
basically the only problem that I have

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.979 
basically the only problem that I have
experienced<00:04:16.850> so<00:04:16.940> far<00:04:16.970> so<00:04:17.390> anyway<00:04:17.600> let's<00:04:17.810> turn

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
experienced so far so anyway let's turn

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:30.910 
experienced so far so anyway let's turn
it<00:04:18.079> on

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.150 

and<00:04:31.920> basically<00:04:32.190> it<00:04:32.550> produces<00:04:33.770> st.<00:04:34.770> every

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
and basically it produces st. every

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.510 
and basically it produces st. every
three<00:04:35.600> times<00:04:36.600> it's<00:04:36.960> the<00:04:37.020> ground<00:04:37.490> should<00:04:38.490> be

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
three times it's the ground should be

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:45.590 
three times it's the ground should be
more<00:04:42.230> again<00:04:43.230> as<00:04:43.410> for<00:04:43.920> white<00:04:44.160> works<00:04:44.550> I<00:04:44.880> cannot

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
more again as for white works I cannot

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.680 
more again as for white works I cannot
tell<00:04:46.110> you<00:04:46.220> I<00:04:47.220> simply<00:04:47.850> don't<00:04:47.970> know<00:04:48.120> I<00:04:48.240> know<00:04:48.450> it's

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
tell you I simply don't know I know it's

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.210 
tell you I simply don't know I know it's
a<00:04:48.920> it's<00:04:49.920> weird<00:04:50.250> I<00:04:50.520> guess<00:04:50.580> it's<00:04:50.970> like<00:04:52.040> you<00:04:53.040> know

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
a it's weird I guess it's like you know

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.400 
a it's weird I guess it's like you know
oh<00:04:53.550> I<00:04:53.640> don't<00:04:53.850> remember<00:04:54.120> who<00:04:54.540> it<00:04:54.570> was<00:04:55.020> but<00:04:55.290> there

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
oh I don't remember who it was but there

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.290 
oh I don't remember who it was but there
was<00:04:55.440> some<00:04:55.650> guy<00:04:55.830> who<00:04:56.030> discovered<00:04:57.030> some<00:04:57.180> very

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
was some guy who discovered some very

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.530 
was some guy who discovered some very
important<00:04:57.900> fish<00:04:59.420> fact

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
important fish fact

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.960 
important fish fact
in<00:05:00.690> within<00:05:01.320> physics<00:05:01.830> and<00:05:02.220> I<00:05:02.490> think<00:05:02.820> it<00:05:02.880> was

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
in within physics and I think it was

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.210 
in within physics and I think it was
Isaac<00:05:03.090> Newton<00:05:03.600> about<00:05:03.810> the<00:05:03.990> gravity<00:05:04.440> he<00:05:04.920> just

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
Isaac Newton about the gravity he just

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.100 
Isaac Newton about the gravity he just
knew<00:05:05.490> it<00:05:05.640> was<00:05:05.880> that<00:05:06.180> way<00:05:06.300> just<00:05:06.810> couldn't

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
knew it was that way just couldn't

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
knew it was that way just couldn't
really<00:05:07.230> describe<00:05:07.650> why<00:05:08.390> and<00:05:09.680> still<00:05:10.680> today<00:05:10.860> we

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
really describe why and still today we

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.980 
really describe why and still today we
don't<00:05:11.340> know<00:05:11.520> why<00:05:11.700> Kravitz<00:05:12.150> it<00:05:12.330> really<00:05:12.540> works<00:05:12.690> I

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
don't know why Kravitz it really works I

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.450 
don't know why Kravitz it really works I
mean<00:05:13.140> you<00:05:13.320> can<00:05:13.470> look<00:05:13.620> it<00:05:13.740> up<00:05:13.830> and<00:05:14.130> you<00:05:14.340> could

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
mean you can look it up and you could

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.310 
mean you can look it up and you could
say<00:05:14.700> oh<00:05:14.730> that's<00:05:15.300> because<00:05:15.450> of<00:05:15.720> mass<00:05:15.930> and<00:05:16.170> stuff

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
say oh that's because of mass and stuff

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.050 
say oh that's because of mass and stuff
but<00:05:16.530> really<00:05:16.740> underneath<00:05:17.220> it<00:05:17.490> we<00:05:17.610> don't<00:05:17.820> know

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
but really underneath it we don't know

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.360 
but really underneath it we don't know
why<00:05:18.210> it<00:05:18.270> works<00:05:18.540> and<00:05:18.840> that's<00:05:19.650> the<00:05:19.860> same<00:05:20.010> for<00:05:20.250> me

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
why it works and that's the same for me

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.200 
why it works and that's the same for me
here<00:05:20.610> I<00:05:20.790> don't<00:05:20.850> really<00:05:21.330> know<00:05:23.090> comparing<00:05:24.090> this

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
here I don't really know comparing this

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.460 
here I don't really know comparing this
to<00:05:24.270> fit<00:05:24.630> to<00:05:24.980> gravity<00:05:25.980> I<00:05:26.130> won't<00:05:27.169> but<00:05:28.169> that<00:05:28.200> it

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
to fit to gravity I won't but that it

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:29.990 
to fit to gravity I won't but that it
seems<00:05:28.740> like<00:05:28.919> it's<00:05:29.220> because<00:05:29.550> this<00:05:29.760> thing

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
seems like it's because this thing

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.150 
seems like it's because this thing
actually<00:05:30.210> stops<00:05:30.780> at<00:05:31.020> four<00:05:31.230> seconds<00:05:31.800> you<00:05:31.980> see

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
actually stops at four seconds you see

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.780 
actually stops at four seconds you see
stuff<00:05:32.520> sit<00:05:32.700> for<00:05:32.850> a<00:05:32.880> second<00:05:33.560> and<00:05:34.640> that<00:05:35.640> is

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790 
stuff sit for a second and that is

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:44.060 
stuff sit for a second and that is
enough<00:05:36.060> to<00:05:36.090> make<00:05:37.020> it<00:05:37.050> flesh<00:05:42.290> that<00:05:43.290> is<00:05:43.560> my<00:05:43.770> best

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
enough to make it flesh that is my best

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.240 
enough to make it flesh that is my best
bet<00:05:44.430> but<00:05:44.850> as<00:05:45.000> recreating<00:05:45.720> the<00:05:46.080> timings<00:05:46.650> with

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
bet but as recreating the timings with

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.720 
bet but as recreating the timings with
you<00:05:47.700> know<00:05:47.820> other<00:05:48.000> settings<00:05:48.570> I<00:05:49.160> have<00:05:50.160> I<00:05:50.580> just

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:50.730 
you know other settings I have I just

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.850 
you know other settings I have I just
can't<00:05:51.180> do<00:05:51.300> that<00:05:51.330> this<00:05:51.840> is<00:05:52.169> the<00:05:52.380> only<00:05:52.710> way<00:05:52.830> that

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
can't do that this is the only way that

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.890 
can't do that this is the only way that
I<00:05:53.070> found<00:05:53.280> that<00:05:53.430> works<00:05:53.700> if<00:05:54.360> someone<00:05:54.720> can

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
I found that works if someone can

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.290 
I found that works if someone can
actually<00:05:55.070> tinker<00:05:56.070> out<00:05:56.220> why<00:05:56.580> it<00:05:56.640> works<00:05:57.000> and

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
actually tinker out why it works and

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.990 
actually tinker out why it works and
maybe<00:05:57.750> yeah<00:05:58.220> you<00:05:59.220> know<00:05:59.340> make<00:05:59.580> it<00:05:59.669> work<00:05:59.820> for

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
maybe yeah you know make it work for

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.060 
maybe yeah you know make it work for
every<00:06:00.390> time<00:06:00.630> it<00:06:00.840> punches<00:06:01.230> up<00:06:01.440> and<00:06:01.590> down<00:06:01.740> and

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070 
every time it punches up and down and

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.510 
every time it punches up and down and
then<00:06:02.820> that<00:06:03.630> would<00:06:03.750> be<00:06:03.900> awesome<00:06:04.290> but

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 
then that would be awesome but

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.590 
then that would be awesome but
personally<00:06:05.520> I<00:06:05.550> will<00:06:05.970> leave<00:06:06.150> it<00:06:06.270> here<00:06:06.300> because

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:06.600 
personally I will leave it here because

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.690 
personally I will leave it here because
it's<00:06:07.110> working<00:06:07.590> I<00:06:07.770> just<00:06:08.040> thought<00:06:08.520> I<00:06:08.580> would

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:08.700 
it's working I just thought I would

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.780 
it's working I just thought I would
share<00:06:08.970> that<00:06:09.060> with<00:06:09.210> you<00:06:09.360> guys<00:06:10.190> so<00:06:11.190> anyway<00:06:11.580> I

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:11.790 
share that with you guys so anyway I

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:14.000 
share that with you guys so anyway I
hope<00:06:12.540> you<00:06:12.600> guys<00:06:12.840> enjoyed<00:06:13.230> the<00:06:13.320> video<00:06:13.410> and<00:06:13.740> if
