only a little less quality it's not very

only a little less quality it's not very

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
noticeable this of course is a gaming

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.830 
noticeable this of course is a gaming
headset<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:41.670> we'll<00:00:41.790> focus<00:00:42.149> is<00:00:42.300> more<00:00:42.540> on<00:00:42.600> the

headset so we'll focus is more on the

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.290 
headset so we'll focus is more on the
strongness<00:00:43.649> under<00:00:44.550> sound<00:00:44.730> rather<00:00:44.940> than<00:00:45.149> the

strongness under sound rather than the

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.000 
strongness under sound rather than the
richness<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.840> quality<00:00:46.320> however<00:00:46.860> the

richness and quality however the
richness<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.430> quality<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.030> what<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.360> find

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
richness and quality is what you find

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.170 
richness and quality is what you find
equivalent<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.800> plantronics<00:00:50.399> 370<00:00:50.969> and

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
equivalent of the plantronics 370 and

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.240 
equivalent of the plantronics 370 and
that's<00:00:51.930> what<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.110> have<00:00:52.350> my<00:00:52.500> basic<00:00:52.770> opinion

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
that's what I have my basic opinion

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.950 
that's what I have my basic opinion
because<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.579> my<00:00:54.000> friend<00:00:54.239> owns<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.629> plantronics

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
because I my friend owns a plantronics

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.040 
because I my friend owns a plantronics
370<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:56.309> found<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.699> only<00:00:56.879> difference<00:00:57.840> is

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
370 and I found the only difference is

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.229 
370 and I found the only difference is
that<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.440> plantronics<00:00:58.890> 370<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.609> bit<00:01:00.059> more

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
that the plantronics 370 is a bit more

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.290 
that the plantronics 370 is a bit more
bigger<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.710> bit<00:01:01.890> more<00:01:02.010> durable<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:03.120> one

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
bigger and a bit more durable this one

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.600 
bigger and a bit more durable this one
is<00:01:03.390> durable<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.870> course<00:01:04.140> as<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.949> see<00:01:05.189> here

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
is durable of course as you see here

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.240 
is durable of course as you see here
it's<00:01:05.790> hard<00:01:06.150> plastic<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.900> will<00:01:07.650> tap<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:08.070> right

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
it's hard plastic I will tap it right

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.170 
it's hard plastic I will tap it right
now<00:01:09.950> hard<00:01:10.950> plastic<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.640> drop<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:11.939> as<00:01:12.000> many
