00:00:00.233 --> 00:00:01.233
Hi everyone!

00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:03.200
I am Powerslide from team Na’Vi.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.067
In the last episode of Science of Victory Luke told you about an all-purpose setup

00:00:07.167 --> 00:00:09.700
which is the easiest to use when playing Team Battles.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.667
This is the setup of 2 T1s, 2 IS-3s, 2 50-100s and a 13-90.

00:00:15.767 --> 00:00:17.767
I have my own opinion on this matter.

00:00:17.867 --> 00:00:22.533
I will tell about the setup I think is the most efficient, and the reasons for it.

00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:25.833
In addition I will answer the questions you posted in the comments.

00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:40.700
I suggest trying this setup: 2 T1s, 2 IS-3s, an AMX 50-100, a T32 and an AMX 13-90.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.133
The only difference is using an American heavy instead of a French one.

00:00:44.233 --> 00:00:48.733
In my opinion this is the best setup when you don’t know which map the battle will be fought on.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.733
You do need more individual skill and good teamwork when using my setup.

00:00:53.833 --> 00:00:58.600
The tanks are very different, and each player has to understand their role clearly to accomplish their tasks.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.800
Basically, this setup can make winning easier,

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.367
but only when you have a good team where every player has a clear understanding

00:01:05.467 --> 00:01:08.700
on what needs to be done, on each and every map.

00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:15.567
On open and mixed maps, of which there are many you can’t fight without an AMX 13-90.

00:01:15.767 --> 00:01:17.733
This tank is very important for scouting.

00:01:17.833 --> 00:01:20.267
The two IS-3s are the main strike force.

00:01:20.367 --> 00:01:26.033
These tanks have the highest damage per shot, and they are very good for positional warfare.

00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:31.600
The AMX 50-100 can be used for quick strikes on most maps, because of its autoloader.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.300
And finally, the T32 is great for both city- and mixed maps, where it’s possible to tank shots with its turret.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.667
Why is my setup better than the one suggested in the past episode of our show?

00:01:43.767 --> 00:01:49.267
I’m convinced that the two AMX 50 100s can’t reach their full potential on mixed and open maps,

00:01:49.367 --> 00:01:51.833
where engagements result in positional warfare.

00:01:51.933 --> 00:01:55.900
A T32 replacing one AMX 50 100 will be much more useful,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.900
mainly because of its almost impenetrable turret and great gun depression.

00:02:03.367 --> 00:02:08.967
Many will ask: “why not use the Pershing? It’s faster and has a sturdy mantlet”.

00:02:09.067 --> 00:02:14.333
First of all, the Pershing’s turret armor is much worse than that of the T32,

00:02:14.433 --> 00:02:17.600
and the regions outside the mantlet can be penetrated easily.

00:02:17.733 --> 00:02:21.967
Second, the T32 is a much better pick for city maps due of several factors:

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.967
It has more hit points, better frontal armor and a higher average damage per shot.

00:02:28.067 --> 00:02:33.867
Somebody will no doubt ask “Why not take a 3rd IS-3, since it’s such a versatile tank”.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.033
I will explain.

00:02:35.133 --> 00:02:39.833
Many maps require a tank which doesn’t only have a high damage per shot and an armored turret,

00:02:39.933 --> 00:02:42.567
but also features good gun depression.

00:02:42.767 --> 00:02:45.733
This greatly expands the range of tactical possibilities.

00:02:45.833 --> 00:02:50.800
It immediately turns bumps in the terrain from irritating obstacles to trusted allies.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.333
There are many such terrain features in the game, and to use them you want the not-fast-but-thick T32.

00:02:57.767 --> 00:02:59.233
We’ll go to your questions now.

00:02:59.333 --> 00:03:03.667
Many of you have asked about the effectiveness of some particular tanks in “Team combat” mode.

00:03:03.767 --> 00:03:06.267
You can find these answers in our previous episodes.

00:03:06.367 --> 00:03:08.233
We have covered this topic through six episodes.

00:03:08.333 --> 00:03:10.633
I’m sure you can find the answers there.

00:03:10.733 --> 00:03:13.167
I will answer one of the questions, though.

00:03:13.267 --> 00:03:17.000
Powerslide, wouldn’t the 110 be superior to the IS-3?

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.000
It has better armor, better accuracy and DPM at the minor cost of a slightly lower alpha.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.200
How is the IS-3 better?

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.967
Many are troubled by this Chinese tank.

00:03:27.067 --> 00:03:30.067
I will tell you why we rarely use it in our matches.

00:03:30.633 --> 00:03:35.100
The tanks has very poor mobility, which limits its ability to freely roam the map.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.000
Yes, the Chinaman can take a beating, thanks to the high frontal hull armor,

00:03:40.167 --> 00:03:44.500
but the Soviet heavy is superior in top speed and has better turret armor.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.167
Besides, the IS-3 can tank with its sides and the 110 can’t.

00:03:48.267 --> 00:03:52.533
The lack of view range on the IS-3 can be compensated for with optics.

00:03:52.633 --> 00:03:57.067
On which tanks does it make sense to use extra rations or cola instead of an extinguisher?

00:03:57.167 --> 00:03:59.967
Should I focus on the firefighting skill in this case?

00:04:00.067 --> 00:04:04.767
I use extra rations on all of my tanks which have at least some firefighting skill.

00:04:05.567 --> 00:04:09.867
Picking the firefighting skill for everyone is only useful after getting the 4th perk.

00:04:09.967 --> 00:04:12.167
The other skills are more important.

00:04:12.567 --> 00:04:16.100
What do you think about replacing one IS-3 with a T-32?

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.767
Less firepower but more armor could be good for maps like steppes, mines...

00:04:21.467 --> 00:04:25.700
The T32 is a really great tank, and that’s why I advise using it in this setup.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.367
I think that it’s an AMX 50 100 that should be swapped for a T32 and not the IS-3 however,

00:04:31.467 --> 00:04:36.167
because it’s very difficult for two AMX 50-100s to reach their potential on most maps.

00:04:36.267 --> 00:04:41.800
A T32 is more useful in a positional firefight, when using its turret and being supported by two IS-3s.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.367
Which map, do you think results in the most complex battles?

00:04:45.467 --> 00:04:47.733
In my opinion, it’s Himmelsdorf.

00:04:47.833 --> 00:04:50.933
It’s really hard to predict enemy tank positioning.

00:04:51.033 --> 00:04:56.933
There are many positions on the map, and they are connected to each other with long passages.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.600
In general it’s not an easy map for playing defensively.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.467
Often the commander and the players need to make very quick decisions on this map.

00:05:05.567 --> 00:05:09.167
When does it make sense to spread out? Is it always a bad idea?

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.767
It makes sense to spread out when attacking enemies entrenched in their base,

00:05:13.867 --> 00:05:16.433
a pretty common situation in team battles.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:22.000
To do this you have to be ABSOLUTELY certain of their positions, and you need to be very careful.

00:05:22.333 --> 00:05:24.633
Here is a typical battle on the Steppes:

00:05:24.733 --> 00:05:28.000
The enemy was nowhere to be seen for the first few minutes of the battle.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.733
As soon as the team was sure that the enemy wasn’t at the rocks,

00:05:30.833 --> 00:05:34.167
it became clear that they were behind the railroad, or near it.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.167
The ISs engage the main forces, but didn’t rush into battle.

00:05:38.267 --> 00:05:40.633
Two TDs were aiming at them.

00:05:40.733 --> 00:05:43.233
Meanwhile the 50 100 sneaked up from line 1

00:05:43.333 --> 00:05:46.967
and destroyed both TDs with one drum before they know what hit them.

00:05:47.133 --> 00:05:49.933
Yes, the enemy left one heavy to guard the flank,

00:05:50.033 --> 00:05:52.733
but you can see how it didn’t do them much good.

00:05:53.233 --> 00:05:57.867
Please, explain the importance of mobility and map control, in one or two episodes

00:05:57.967 --> 00:06:01.400
When should the team attack and when should they play defense?

00:06:01.833 --> 00:06:06.767
We will discuss these topics in the next couple of episodes of “Science of Victory”.

00:06:06.867 --> 00:06:13.333
The next episode will tell you about analyzing the enemy team’s setup and choosing your tactics accordingly.

00:06:13.433 --> 00:06:16.267
Then we’ll more on to a detailed analysis on playing the maps

00:06:16.367 --> 00:06:19.200
with the all-purpose setup we talked about last time.

00:06:20.825 --> 00:06:24.799
And finally a few words about the contest we announced in the previous episode of “Science of Victory”.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.999
Several of you could guess the setup I picked.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.299
You can see the winners on the screen.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.299
Each one of them gets a thousand gold.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:33.199
Congratulations!

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.200
And that’s it! I hope you liked the show.
