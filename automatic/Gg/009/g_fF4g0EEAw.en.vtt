00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:42.280
 Hi, I'm Alex Ax and this review of 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:45.220
 fault to blue cup 171 and the UN 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.220
 the name already writes an effect that 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:51.160
 basically shakes a change 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:54.430
 cyclical volume and that you have 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.559
 controlling climate so well 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:01.180
 interesting 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:04.440
 SRG're connected in the center position here 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:08.650
 guitar controls not linked by hare 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:11.430
 in line and circulation of up to 30 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.430
 is 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.119
 let's turn it all on flash 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.850
 is 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.790
 the government can give you one of the 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.410
 cool weather and let's go to the controls 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.770
 is the first control you see that the 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:43.800
 rage noticed an important detail here 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.720
 it blinks at the speed at which it 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:51.810
 The king is in place this is well 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:55.700
 interesting right because you reduce the 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.700
 flasher corresponded 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.829
 A fan 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.730
 i 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.310
 the next button is the deficit is 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:19.069
 depth of effect the more 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.069
 deep, more audible it stays 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.930
 all 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:38.580
 I'm looking for, nor is everything, and being more 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.580
 discreet 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:47.380
 and here I have the waveform 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:50.030
 if I want him more pointed or more 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.050
 will say yes pointy 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.050
 stay a little softer 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.770
 it will be hard 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.400
 is basically more triangular than 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.400
 grid 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.400
 i 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.330
 framed tona 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.380
 hi 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:53.770
 so I mean the idea is it's a one pedal 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:59.890
 relatively simple late you operate 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:04:02.740
 because basically a ground one and it is 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.590
 works one of the prose balconies that in this 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:08.590
 pedal is precisely the fact of having fun 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:11.530
 he is from this light it is flashing then 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:15.490
 You have what it's like to have a sense of 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:18.910
 accompany neon though it does not have a 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:20.739
 Do not listen to the numerical question 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.530
 take the battery tell you the time 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:27.370
 mentally you can keep up with 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:31.510
 The blinks he blinks at her beauty. 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:34.690
 For hire, it's the hell, it's for 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.010
 who likes to create such climates and 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:41.260
 that suddenly I 'm a little tired 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:44.760
 leave her from koro c franju made 87 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.760
 Can you put some nuances 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:07.180
 23 looks good and I liked most handsome 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.840
 from the position here triangular even that 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.840
 it gets very 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.640
 is 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:20.920
 the most modern and right so to speak 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.920
 he even more here 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:54.780
 It's bacaninha, right? 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:56.760
 exploring new horizons I think it is 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.940
 It's a cool idea. A cool idea. 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:03.320
 beauty until the next then until the next 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.320
