00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:21.180
 it's not normal because we do not have many 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.170
 weeks to train us 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.330
 good we do 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.460
 when it is particular we only have 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.000
 the possibility of forgiving the 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:34.020
 next match 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.090
 to work in the weeks with a load 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.090
 normal training 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.550
 in general the match was very good 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.880
 because it is true that at first 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:02.470
 we have spoken with great intensity but 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.470
 we played Thursday evening 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.520
 then at the beginning we have given 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.310
 quite slow after the second part 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.550
 it was much more intense I liked the team 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.960
 because he has had intelligence in the 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.960
 manage the party has arranged 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.320
 well over the whole second part and 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:26.550
 then small details but the play 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.760
 of karim is spectacular I do not know what to say 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.760
 plus 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.540
 d 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.150
 sportive best 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:44.710
 we suffer 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:44.710
 and I think the whole team played well 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:53.900
 but the key of the party certainly 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.530
 it was the wave of affection that has made a 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.530
 extraordinary thing 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.690
 what 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.760
 this first part of the season the 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.640
 League we have done it very well it is true 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.410
 that we do not see we have started with some 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.280
 problems after we had a streak 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.280
 very very good 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.530
 the part of the defeat of valencia I think 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.130
 what 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.680
 the team continues with wins we have a lot 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:37.630
 this competition we are fine 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.630
 positioned we have to continue 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.810
 partly imparts I think 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:03:02.290
 the intensity with which we finished 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:04.540
 before Christmas is a little bit better 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:09.560
 but I think the team is improving 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:12.860
 also players I think at the beginning 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.560
 for example galmÃ©s was not so good 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.239
 physically but today he has made a match 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.780
 extraordinary has returned to the best 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:24.340
 condition then little by little the team 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.340
 returns to its greatest condition 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.500
 if you arrive 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.110
 everyone is happy I think that 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.220
 they were collective plays this is very 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.990
 good 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.070
 the bonus was fantastic assistance 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:54.690
 for Christians of karim the other two 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.690
 we leave to see the Christian then 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.490
 it is clear that Christian is the 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:06.400
 completion for us also of the 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:10.480
 front part the first part where 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:13.800
 we have had some problems the 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.800
 second part was much better 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:34.700
 Caritas is fine, it's just a blow 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:37.110
 he has no problem his physical state is 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:40.950
 very very good 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:43.740
 of motril more or less a month or so 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:47.730
 is not recovering well started to 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:51.650
 work individual to run but 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.650
 we still need a month 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:05.340
 I think it was a match 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:07.110
 smart we do not see takers behind 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.100
 the controlled ones may well be that 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.930
 we have to improve the pressure without the ball 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:15.509
 when the team is 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:18.830
 a compact in the field the first part 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:20.630
 we have not put pressure 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:24.820
 for this rhythm of the game now a 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.820
 little bit slower with our question
