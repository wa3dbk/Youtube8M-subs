00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:05.350
 between the wounded 5 and 11 Europe lives a transitional period that will take them 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:06.820
 Romanesque 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:11.080
 in these six centuries the dance sculpture of minor importance in front of the 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.619
 architecture 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:14.130
 in my Carolingian era 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.380
 we found some figures of round shape and reliefs 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:19.510
 the Visigothic sculpture 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.220
 Athens is developed 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.359
 but it highlights the excellent capitals of san pedro de la nave 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.029
 and the quintaillilla reliefs of the vineyards 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:29.820
 of the Asturian sculpture 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.370
 there are only small remains of reliefs of the Naranco complex 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:35.910
 Romanesque 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.080
 will bring with it a recovery of the sculpture that right now 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.470
 will perform a didactic and moralistic hour when placed in the house 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.470
 of God to become a book in stone 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.060
 one of the most constant representations 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.830
 the mesh these Dominican pantocrator 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.510
 figure of Christ in glory seated on a throne as the beginning and end of all 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:59.390
 things 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.630
 next to him are the four evangelists the tetra mozos 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.190
 the lives of Christ and the virgin are usually chosen to accompany the 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.470
 previous scenes while the apocalypse of san juan will be a source 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.910
 exceptional for the 24 elders by the resurrection of the dead 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.390
 Most of the figures are characterized by their strong character 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.670
 symbolic 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.230
 showing majestic stiff 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.560
 and erratic 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.549
 with certain apocalyptic notes but full of ingenuity and impact 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.549
 expressive force at the same time 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.630
 The cooperators will be able to harmonize the realism that shows 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.340
 Exterior 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.190
 with a deep inner idealism 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.660
 the conventions to extracts of Romanesque give way to a new sense 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.660
 of naturalness and humanization of religion 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.690
 although it is true that Gothic sculpture is subordinated to the 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:53.770
 architecture 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.390
 we began to observe also the first 60 figures 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.530
 the covers of churches and cathedrals 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.680
 they are the most impressive sets of this artistic moment 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.360
 with the statues attached to never imagine them almost turned into bulk 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.980
 round and the reliefs decorating the eardrums pediments and archivolts with a 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.980
 obvious theological sense and say tico 

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:22.310
 the funerary art begins to emerge with force 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.110
 observing at first the type grave maybe 

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:31.369
 with the figure lying on the grave giving way to the so-called model wins what 

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:35.739
 consists of a sarcophagus dug into the wall with the figure lying on top 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.049
 while in later centuries the figures will abandon their statism 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.049
 habitual to become living characters 

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:48.139
 the exempted figures mentioned above are presented with tea majors 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:52.739
 appreciating in them a singular vitalist note and a significant tendency 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.049
 to flexibility 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.139
 in the 15th century we find the moment of apogee of the Gothic sculpture 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:04.079
 creating images loaded with pathos and with more outstanding perfection 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:08.049
 technique as seen in the German school hello burgundy 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:12.040
 without forgetting the Spaniards who have an accentuated influence 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.349
 flamenco in their works
