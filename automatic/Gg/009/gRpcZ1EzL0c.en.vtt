00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.640
 we are uned 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.520
 to know the uned is to know the history 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.380
 of the people who one day trusted 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.000
 in a new way of understanding the 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.189
 education 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.270
 visionaries perhaps ahead of their 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:32.490
 possibly time 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.980
 but those founders there by the 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.930
 70s understood that a new 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.180
 way of understanding education and 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.670
 understanding distance was a way of 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.300
 create a more plural and 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.300
 globalized 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.210
 the uned was created following the wake of 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.800
 the open university of the united kingdom- 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.350
 they would also follow others like the German 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.140
 fermÃ­n university the dutch or 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.469
 Universitet or the Portuguese university 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.469
 from alberta 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.390
 they all form the pillars of what 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.170
 that today is the European association of 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.170

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.600
