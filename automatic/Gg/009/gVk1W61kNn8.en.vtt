00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
android gesture typing hey let's just

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.240 
android gesture typing hey let's just

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
type the same exact thing so see how

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.980 
type the same exact thing so see how
accurate<00:01:53.610> this<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.329> hey<00:01:56.240> now<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.299> first<00:01:57.689> part

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
accurate this is hey now the first part

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.980 
accurate this is hey now the first part
is<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.409> can<00:01:58.890> do<00:01:59.070> all<00:01:59.189> this<00:01:59.430> all<00:01:59.700> at<00:01:59.909> once<00:02:00.119> i<00:02:00.360> first

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
is I can do all this all at once i first

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.719 
is I can do all this all at once i first
have<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.229> do<00:02:01.530> hey<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.189> then<00:02:03.140> house<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.799> then

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
have to do hey and then house and then

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.380 
have to do hey and then house and then
it<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.570> then<00:02:07.170> going

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
it and then going

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.520 
it and then going
and<00:02:09.229> then<00:02:09.740> I<00:02:09.860> have<00:02:10.039> to<00:02:10.130> put<00:02:10.460> the<00:02:10.490> question<00:02:10.850> mark

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
and then I have to put the question mark

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.699 
and then I have to put the question mark
so<00:02:12.530> it's<00:02:12.800> a<00:02:12.950> little<00:02:13.310> complicated<00:02:13.730> it's<00:02:14.709> but

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
so it's a little complicated it's but

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.730 
so it's a little complicated it's but
it's<00:02:15.980> easier<00:02:16.550> on<00:02:16.819> swiftkey<00:02:17.480> flow<00:02:17.510> because<00:02:18.440> in

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
it's easier on swiftkey flow because in

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.190 
it's easier on swiftkey flow because in
a<00:02:18.830> way<00:02:18.860> you<00:02:19.069> don't<00:02:19.430> have<00:02:19.490> to<00:02:19.720> stop<00:02:20.720> anywhere

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
a way you don't have to stop anywhere

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.490 
a way you don't have to stop anywhere
you<00:02:21.380> can<00:02:21.560> just<00:02:21.770> keep<00:02:22.520> on<00:02:22.760> going<00:02:22.790> till<00:02:23.450> till<00:02:24.380> I

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
you can just keep on going till till I

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.610 
you can just keep on going till till I
