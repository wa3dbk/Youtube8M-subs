00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:06.010
 today we will see together 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.689
 the different points in order to acquire a 

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.370
 used car a few points 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:10.990
 important not to be fooled 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.270
 when you buy a used car 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.610
 you can check if the vehicle has 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:18.100
 been hilly or repainted just by 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:21.429
 simply looking at the light 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:24.939
 two body parts next see 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:26.679
 if the color is the same or not so 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.199
 it is often possible that on vehicles 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:31.150
 a solid color you find the park 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.710
 shocked a little darker or lighter 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.539
 that the rest of the vehicle in this case 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.609
 it will mean that the bumper has been 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:38.320
 repainted to verify that the vehicle 

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:40.000
 is not stolen just enough 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.000
 simply check the number of 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.680
 vehicle chassis that are here 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.079
 to the one written on your registration card at 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.969
 location number 1 have checked if the 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:52.870
 vehicle was crashed or not everything 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:54.969
 just look at the level of the day 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.920
 here and day 2 the side it's this 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:00.399
 that 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:03.280
 the gap will be identical to these levels 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:05.799
 at the door level at the 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.830
 record amount but essentially to 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.759
 level of the bumper and bonnet in order to 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.399
 do not be fooled 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.960
 it is better but not required 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:16.539
 to release a language certificate 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.140
 visible on the internet on the website of 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:19.689
 government 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.490
 there is some information indicated 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:23.229
 now let's check the 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.610
 underbody of the vehicle so the whole 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:30.580
 part that is below the 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:33.640
 vehicle if you have the opportunity 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.619
 then to check especially the underbody 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.270
 of cash and adios all that is 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.340
 underneath the vehicle you are not 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.280
 visible to anyone and who can 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.920
 hide a lot of faults the train 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.850
 back that the rear shock absorbers the 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.340
 exhaust line 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.259
 front axle and front shock absorbers 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.270
 long now see things 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.470
 essential to check in the engine 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.659
 so the essential things in the 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.179
 engine part are the oil level 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.610
 the coolant is the state 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:02.500
 of the battery these three things there are 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.729
 key signs to know if the 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.200
 vehicle is well maintained by 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.450
 their former owners for 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.979
 check the mileage of a vehicle there 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.260
 just look at the mileage 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.290
 which is on the dashboard of 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:17.400
 compare the cost the mileage to the state 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.890
 general steering wheel pedal 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.570
 w speed and seat now we 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.230
 let's see the pitfalls to avoid on a 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.230
 rolling vehicle 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.240
 the different essential points to 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.640
 check on a used vehicle 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.770
 before any acquisition are the 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.349
 direction whether it crackles or not 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:39.110
 the gearbox to know if when 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:41.390
 you move speed from a1 to 5 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:46.069
 there is a noise or not where I avoided it 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:48.770
 pleasant space to test also the 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.810
 reversing who can also have a 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.850
 slight snags when you 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.160
 once in a straight line behind the wheel 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.810
 of the vehicle let go of the steering wheel and and 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.209
 keep your foot on the accelerator 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.860
 in order to find out if the steering wheel third to 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.400
 left or right what could be 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.200
 synonymous with shock left or right good ben 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.910
 here I hope I have brought you all 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.549
 the necessary solutions so 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.090
 to acquire a used vehicle without 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.090
 to make you have
