your ability to succeed
think<00:02:00.840> about<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.200> typically<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.979> things<00:02:02.009> that

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
think about it typically the things that

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.709 
think about it typically the things that
people<00:02:02.610> see<00:02:02.909> as<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.090> must

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
people see as a must

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.330 
people see as a must
the<00:02:03.930> reason<00:02:04.259> they<00:02:04.350> see<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.649> as<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.799> must<00:02:05.130> is

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
the reason they see it as a must is

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.010 
the reason they see it as a must is
because<00:02:05.729> it's<00:02:05.939> tied<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.570> negative

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
because it's tied to negative

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.469 
because it's tied to negative
consequences<00:02:07.200> for<00:02:08.129> example<00:02:08.330> let's<00:02:09.330> go<00:02:09.390> back

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
consequences for example let's go back

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.550 
consequences for example let's go back
to<00:02:09.690> some<00:02:09.840> of<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:09.989> things<00:02:10.170> that<00:02:10.289> we<00:02:10.349> just
