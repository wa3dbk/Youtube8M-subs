00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
all righty here we are and I am going to

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.690 
all righty here we are and I am going to
make<00:00:06.240> the<00:00:06.480> dehydrated<00:00:07.200> remains<00:00:08.040> from<00:00:08.460> the

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
make the dehydrated remains from the

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.129 
make the dehydrated remains from the
mushroom<00:00:09.059> stock<00:00:09.360> that<00:00:09.570> I<00:00:09.660> made<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:09.960> other<00:00:10.019> day

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
mushroom stock that I made the other day

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.830 
mushroom stock that I made the other day
so<00:00:10.950> what<00:00:11.219> I<00:00:11.250> did<00:00:11.370> was<00:00:11.670> I<00:00:11.849> strained<00:00:12.389> it<00:00:12.509> all<00:00:12.599> and

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
so what I did was I strained it all and

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.720 
so what I did was I strained it all and
I<00:00:12.900> put<00:00:13.110> everything<00:00:13.320> in<00:00:13.530> a<00:00:13.590> bowl<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:14.070> this<00:00:14.580> is

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
I put everything in a bowl and this is

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.250 
I put everything in a bowl and this is
all<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.179> mushrooms<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.809> it<00:00:15.870> even<00:00:16.080> has<00:00:16.230> the

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
all the mushrooms and it even has the

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.810 
all the mushrooms and it even has the
carrots<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:16.949> celery<00:00:17.160> now<00:00:17.520> I'm<00:00:17.580> going<00:00:17.760> to

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
carrots and celery now I'm going to

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.279 
carrots and celery now I'm going to
leave<00:00:17.970> those<00:00:18.180> in<00:00:18.390> there<00:00:18.570> because<00:00:18.750> I<00:00:18.960> think<00:00:19.020> it

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
leave those in there because I think it

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.560 
leave those in there because I think it
adds<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.650> little<00:00:19.830> bit<00:00:19.949> more<00:00:20.100> flavor<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.789> I'm

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
adds a little bit more flavor and I'm

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.160 
adds a little bit more flavor and I'm
simply<00:00:21.900> putting<00:00:22.230> it<00:00:22.350> into<00:00:22.619> my<00:00:22.920> blender<00:00:23.730> and

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.170 
simply putting it into my blender and

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.689 
simply putting it into my blender and
then<00:00:25.170> I'm<00:00:25.500> gonna<00:00:25.650> blend<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.310> up<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.640> that's

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
then I'm gonna blend it up and that's

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.910 
then I'm gonna blend it up and that's
kind<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.029> loud<00:00:27.150> so<00:00:27.480> I'll<00:00:27.599> do<00:00:27.779> it<00:00:27.960> I'll<00:00:28.740> come

I've done and I put on my round

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.170 
I've done and I put on my round
dehydrator<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.430> can<00:00:35.610> see<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:35.910> there<00:00:36.059> it's

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
dehydrator and you can see it there it's

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.180 
dehydrator and you can see it there it's
kind<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.450> just<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.719> thick<00:00:37.020> paste<00:00:37.680> kind<00:00:38.040> of

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
reminds me of when I did that dehydrated

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.340

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
looks like as soon as I'm done blending

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.420 
looks like as soon as I'm done blending
it<00:00:47.309> up

second and it blends all down like I
said<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.100> reminds<00:00:56.730> me<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:56.850> refried<00:00:57.360> beans

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:57.630

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.260 
my big square dehydrator it doesn't so I
just<00:01:10.200> covered<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.680> trays<00:01:10.950> with<00:01:11.220> some<00:01:11.520> plastic

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
nice and thin put it in the dehydrator

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.719 
nice and thin put it in the dehydrator
and<00:01:22.260> I'm<00:01:22.320> gonna<00:01:22.470> let<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.680> go<00:01:22.770> overnight<00:01:23.369> and

tomorrow when I come home from work and
I'll<00:01:27.690> be<00:01:27.720> able<00:01:28.050> to<00:01:28.440> powder<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.460> up<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.970> then<00:01:30.150> if

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
I'll be able to powder it up and then if

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.380 
I'll be able to powder it up and then if
you<00:01:31.110> do<00:01:31.680> powder<00:01:32.010> and<00:01:32.460> it's<00:01:32.670> still<00:01:32.910> a<00:01:32.940> little

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
you do powder and it's still a little

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.910 
you do powder and it's still a little
like<00:01:33.510> it<00:01:33.630> all<00:01:33.720> clumps<00:01:34.110> up<00:01:34.229> in<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.470> jar<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.710> can

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
like it all clumps up in the jar you can

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.710 
like it all clumps up in the jar you can
spread<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.580> out<00:01:35.790> in<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:35.970> dehydrator<00:01:36.479> and

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
spread that out in the dehydrator and

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.320 
spread that out in the dehydrator and
you<00:01:37.290> can<00:01:37.530> dry<00:01:37.950> even<00:01:38.369> after<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.820> powder<00:01:39.060> is

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330
