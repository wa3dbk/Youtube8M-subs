00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.209
 welcome to paul is easy 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:12.370
 today we will see the river 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:14.559
 screen the vacuum with fines also 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.390
 reminded angel and with more your anthem 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.099
 from the beginner level it's also a 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.750
 little of the first as we go towards the 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:21.130
 mecque the bar of a go so it would 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.410
 be particularly vigilant 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.840
 to warm the shoulders to the maximum of 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:34.390
 their amplitude I show it and learn 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:36.160
 the French you will see at the beginning it 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.900
 seems a little complicated to take off from 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.860
 the bar but to settle for placement a 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.410
 impractical 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.970
 he lives to become son and graceful then 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.370
 to do that we 're going to go through 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.650
 several stages the first is to 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.050
 get my hands on the bar I'm going 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:53.140
 go from water to the bar and I'm going to do 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.660
 a club of tricks to place my shoulder 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:59.350
 against the bar and put my king in 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.600
 direction of the ground from there I'm going to bend the 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.720
 knees and pointing errors as 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.060
 stack of the majolica thriller will leave 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.070
 in front of and will make a big green circle 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.320
 career the idea is to come replace 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:17.020
 our country a little pop on their head away 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:20.100
 I put you in between them I do them in our 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.100
 meaning for you to see badly 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.539
 once this first step completed 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.909
 successfully you can move to the second 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:37.170
 step that consists of doing my marine life 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.299
 in its entirety 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.289
 so to break out fights get put 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.450
 a little bit like we wanted to do 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:44.670
 a pivot I want to put on half a point 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.789
 tram agents outside I put my hand 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.920
 are there I give you back ben I place 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:52.350
 in August against the other fingers I'm going 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.090
 the back of the hand be there down I'm going 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.979
 to leave as if I wanted to live 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.689
 where I'm going to do that half and I 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:02.130
 will take my life to where I'll be 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.280
 shows in our direction for whatever 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.950
 other thing so I'm going to jean luc 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.110
 hallowed the girl on a tip the dollar 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.450
 against the mark seek the bar be 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.450
 inside and I'm my towards this country 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.080
 so if you are 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.040
 this movement this part of the video 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.410
 is for you 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.330
 the first thing that we will try to 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.459
 see with those river girl knows how 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.500
 our outside kind can you 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:35.610
 train and how can use 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:39.000
 the safe haven to turn we go 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.830
 so put our bar to the feeling it is to 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.720
 to say that the bar is free she from 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.510
 turn on itself and we're going 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.730
 try to redo the first half 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.340
 then we will be ready if national the 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.519
 sort of because I put my hand along 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.370
 from there I put my right leg August 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.870
 the yellows outside in front and I'm going 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.209
 try to make a big circle 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:06.360
 until I feel a little hippie 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:09.420
 taken by my back I do them 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.269
 in the other direction for you to see I have 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.549
 a job very early at the bar the price 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.799
 that a little while young and will undermine 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:19.379
 sun direction I bend my legs 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.870
 I love Jean FerriÃ¨res very far 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:24.989
 in front and I draw a big circle 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:31.739
 possible and see me stay close 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:34.109
 fun once I felt the strength 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.970
 centrifuge an embellished to turn I 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:37.709
 so go see how I can pay my 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.139
 leg for her to come after more 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:43.590
 easily on the ground so I will iron 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:44.549
 by the same position the legs I tend 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.280
 my outer leg 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:49.440
 I'm going to make my big circle when 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.299
 I feel that my feet jostle me that I 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:56.549
 suppressed in January had pushed with 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:04:02.790
 the front officer I 'm doing them in 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:05.549
 your sense I am good 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.849
 the poles of the var against the pond the finger 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:11.280
 towards the right major ground and in 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:13.590
 the more she will do an inventory my 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.789
 toes creek end of the final game I find 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:20.130
 Charles Saint Christie and I 'm well worth 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:21.900
 to realize a jury the winter it is necessary 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.300
 never that butt touches art 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.440
 so we'll see now and who 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.180
 plays streaming 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.039
 how we can take off from a 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.729
 buttock of the bar we will be ironing 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:36.539
 by our position is ticking on the 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:38.490
 side I fall on his knees before I go 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:40.440
 this time I'll go if you 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.360
 can benefit well and tender 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.590
 but two kinds so that doing it 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.020
 believe in the cumulards 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.000
 so you see to do this exercise 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.280
 you really have to shoot at your 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.260
 arm that in water for you come 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:56.849
 I put you down on the ground now 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.130
 I understood that I succeeded in the 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:00.960
 paul mfer the bar we will try 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.020
 to make our opinion green and in 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.969
 completeness and always finished I had 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:11.400
 so this half point on the leg 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:13.600
 outside this level I see it there and I 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.250
 do not mind 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:19.190
 finally we will realize our 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:21.770
 static and way versions 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.270
 integral so this time the bar does not 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.639
 find more so we'll have to leave 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.229
 slide zuma for from the bar and well 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:29.150
 heard not too much shaking the bottom hand 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:31.669
 because the more we rhyme a big 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.180
 turn I am so a new function 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:36.110
 of our points 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:41.479
 i will start in 2006 beautiful robert 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:42.800
 worse and I well and you are dear 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:45.710
 all the cards in hand to achieve 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.360
 brilliantly on the spin winter do not forget 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.160
 that it takes a little bit of strength to 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.259
 many packages of the bar so do not hesitate 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.699
 not to do it and to do it right again at 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:53.960
 start of the session once you have 

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:57.789
 ended that the warm ups 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.789
 see you soon for a new round
