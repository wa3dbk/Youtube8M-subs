00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.610 

seemed<00:00:40.150> like<00:00:40.180> you<00:00:40.870> guys<00:00:40.900> had<00:00:41.260> a<00:00:41.290> hard<00:00:41.560> time

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
seemed like you guys had a hard time

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.800 
seemed like you guys had a hard time
getting<00:00:42.160> them<00:00:42.310> off<00:00:42.490> the<00:00:42.700> field<00:00:43.000> on<00:00:43.180> third<00:00:43.540> down

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:43.810 
getting them off the field on third down

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.450 
getting them off the field on third down
you<00:00:44.020> had<00:00:44.110> a<00:00:44.170> couple<00:00:44.380> third<00:00:44.710> and<00:00:44.920> longs<00:00:45.100> in<00:00:45.370> the

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
you had a couple third and longs in the

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.670 
you had a couple third and longs in the
first<00:00:45.730> half<00:00:46.000> they're<00:00:46.720> able<00:00:46.960> to<00:00:47.170> convert<00:00:47.530> you

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
first half they're able to convert you

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.840 
first half they're able to convert you
think<00:00:47.890> that<00:00:48.040> was<00:00:48.160> the<00:00:48.280> difference<00:00:48.430> of<00:00:48.760> the

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
think that was the difference of the

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.910 
think that was the difference of the
first<00:00:49.120> half<00:00:49.330> definitely<00:00:50.080> definitely<00:00:50.590> they

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
first half definitely definitely they

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.979 
first half definitely definitely they
