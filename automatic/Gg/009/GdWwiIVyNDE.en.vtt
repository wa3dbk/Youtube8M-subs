00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.000
 Hi, I am Sarah Maxwell and have been a fitness coach for over 20 years. 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.500
 I am also NIVEA's fitness and lifestyle expert. I'm here in Montreal 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.400
 to do something exciting. 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 I think the thought that people take with this game 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 is that exercises can also be fun and not a threshold. 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.000
 And I also think it's amazing that Nivea has chosen me. There are 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.190
 hundreds of other trainers; I have a life like everyone else. 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.809
 I don't work with very obsessive fitness exercises. 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.479
 n what I want everyone to learn is that training can also be fun. 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.670
 Nobody is perfect. 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.450
 Nivea approached me because of my philosophy. They didn't come to me and said, "We want you to say this." 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.780
 So this is what you get. This is me completely 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.159
 and everything is real. And they said, "We like how you think" 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.159
 "We want to be honest and tell people that they only do the maximum 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.469
 can get this cream if they use it in combination with a healthy diet and exercise. " 

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:37.380
 I think the combination of me, the Your Shape game and NIVEA is great. 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.990
 Many people have never thought about using a video game for their fitness exercises. 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.429
 Yet now they suddenly think: "Wait a minute, I can do this too!" 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:50.000
 All right! Good job! Let's go on like this! 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.259
 Because Nivea is such a trusted brand, 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.960
 people say: "If Nivea does this, it will work." 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.619
 I make an appearance in Your Shape: Fitness Evolved and we have a special NIVEA 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:11.619
 program I have worked on. The program fits in perfectly with your life pattern. 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.310
 My name is Nicola Godin. I work at Ubisoft Montreal and I am one 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.510
 from the game designers of Your Shape: Fitness Evolved. 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.010
 We are working with many people on this title and also very closely with Sarah Maxwell from Nivea. 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:39.010
 She came to Montreal to work with us and to incorporate one of her own programs into the game. 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.790
 Because it is a very time-consuming process to manually program these animations, we have used our 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.489
 MoCap studio and motion capture applied. As you see behind me, Sarah has Maxwell 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.659
 her suit already complete with the sensors. We can keep track of all her movements 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:03:01.659
 and making sure that they all come into the game exactly. 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:20.209
 After this workout with Nivea and Your Shape: Fitness Evolved you will notice the effect 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.349
 has on your whole body. The intention is that you get a full workout. 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:27.799
 From head to toe, including the abs because there is a lot 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:33.209
 use of balance training in this workout. It is really worth doing. 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.870
 Use the cream, do the exercises and eat healthy!
