00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:04.390
 in this video we will learn to have the color of the trilateral cover of our folklore 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.870
 we are obedient 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.129
 very well 

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:11.620
 it's not that I'm messed up the cover of the sports world the theme of my 

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:14.539
 It's a horrible travel photo 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:15.839
 So 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.499
 I have several reports 

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:21.499
 Anyway, let's go to the cover that's what matters 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.640
 as guilty will have injured body of fund of the cover of the year after 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:31.449
 only here when you select field you can click this bottom button 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:34.579
 note that the pages do not appear so close to the bottom 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.440
 How to choose a background color 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.970
 I can choose any of these things that will appear 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.220
 on the right-hand side of the album 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.330
 afternoon in the essential cabin if it is blank has nothing covering 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.370
 and in the final stage 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.640
 Let's suppose I want to leave white. 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.570
 if I leave white that is the default when you win a photobook it 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.090
 White 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.840
 the whole cover of the world illustrates white - even the text marks the bada 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.190
 so everything can be configured what we are going to do 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.490
 I want to leave this color green with all cars clearer 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.400
 Let's choose a color 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.450
 however hand stress 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.080
 I want to leave that brown color for our cover to our laterally to the 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.620
 final stage of the course 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.410
 this highlight in the plot can be configured just give two clicks of ti 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.550
 you can choose what you want can set a font 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.270
 the source I chose here to comics 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.430
 I can choose the regular font but criticize the boot 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.670
 and what I did 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.010
 the size can not be changed this is the default will always keep what you 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.040
 you may be changing this color in the text 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.860
 I have all the races I have chosen to choose. 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.010
 always in this clip a strong color and a weak color 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.480
 or do not try to put a very dark color that will not get good 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.960
 dow jones worth 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.590
 I do not remember right 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.230
 so if our color of guilt dark 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.440
 we choose a broker that looks better as white for example 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:09.809
 or maybe even MaranhÃ£o 

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:12.329
 But how are you going to stay? 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:15.349
