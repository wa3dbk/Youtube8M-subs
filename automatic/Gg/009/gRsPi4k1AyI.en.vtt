00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.240 
flipping on the phone open I'm gonna
take<00:01:33.540> out<00:01:33.659> another<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.259> little<00:01:34.530> glass<00:01:34.829> like

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
take out another of a little glass like

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.370 
take out another of a little glass like
so<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:36.090> find<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.570> actual<00:01:36.869> screen

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
so you find that the actual screen

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.780 
so you find that the actual screen
itself<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.829> quite<00:01:37.950> small<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.549> going<00:01:38.729> around

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
itself is quite small and going around

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.090 
itself is quite small and going around
1.5<00:01:39.479> inches<00:01:39.840> diagonally<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:40.680> it's<00:01:40.829> pretty

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
1.5 inches diagonally so it's pretty

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.679 
1.5 inches diagonally so it's pretty
small<00:01:41.460> motorola<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.270> could<00:01:42.450> have<00:01:42.540> done<00:01:42.659> a

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
small motorola I could have done a

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.270 
small motorola I could have done a
better<00:01:42.810> job<00:01:42.930> at<00:01:43.259> optimizing<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.890> size<00:01:44.070> and

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
better job at optimizing the size and

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.679 
better job at optimizing the size and
expanding<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.030> little<00:01:45.210> bit<00:01:45.390> but<00:01:45.570> overall

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
expanding it a little bit but overall

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.020 
expanding it a little bit but overall
does<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.500> nice<00:01:46.740> job<00:01:46.860> by<00:01:47.130> displaying<00:01:47.640> basic

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
does a nice job by displaying basic

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.179 
does a nice job by displaying basic
content<00:01:48.360> like<00:01:48.479> emails<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.229> call<00:01:49.530> logs<00:01:49.799> and

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
content like emails and call logs and

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.679 
content like emails and call logs and
it's<00:01:50.549> pretty<00:01:50.759> bright<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.119> vibrant<00:01:51.210> in<00:01:51.509> our

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
it's pretty bright and vibrant in our

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.120 
it's pretty bright and vibrant in our
test<00:01:51.930> so<00:01:52.140> far<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.560> have<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.710> little<00:01:52.950> bit<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.070> a

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
test so far you have a little bit of a

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.830 
test so far you have a little bit of a
speaker<00:01:53.399> on<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.700> top<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.119> on<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.509> bottom<00:01:54.810> we

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
speaker on the top and on the bottom we

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.649 
speaker on the top and on the bottom we

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
have the dial pad v 180 logo the numbers

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.090 
have the dial pad v 180 logo the numbers
are<00:01:57.840> pretty<00:01:57.869> large<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.409> they<00:01:58.530> are<00:01:58.710> spaced

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
are pretty large and they are spaced

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.310 
are pretty large and they are spaced
apart<00:01:59.399> fairly<00:01:59.729> well<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.930> buttons<00:02:01.200> are

even gets worse than the front and just

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.089 
even gets worse than the front and just
as<00:02:23.329> a<00:02:23.420> result<00:02:23.780> we<00:02:24.230> found<00:02:24.439> this<00:02:24.560> device<00:02:24.739> to<00:02:24.980> have

a<00:02:25.129> very<00:02:25.370> you<00:02:25.700> know<00:02:25.730> poor<00:02:26.120> plastic<00:02:26.659> feel<00:02:26.989> to<00:02:27.200> it

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
a very you know poor plastic feel to it

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:28.569 
a very you know poor plastic feel to it
especially<00:02:27.530> that's<00:02:27.859> your<00:02:27.950> dialing<00:02:28.370> really

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 
especially that's your dialing really

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:30.910

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
fast you'll feel that the keypad is very

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.300 
fast you'll feel that the keypad is very
slippery<00:02:31.340> and<00:02:32.560> just<00:02:33.560> doesn't<00:02:33.769> feel<00:02:34.069> as<00:02:34.280> good

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
decent call quality was a little bit

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.849 
decent call quality was a little bit
staticky<00:02:55.879> which<00:02:56.030> is<00:02:56.150> kind<00:02:56.810> of<00:02:56.870> surprising<00:02:57.019> for
