00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.000

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.900
 This device is very fresh today 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.610

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.460

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.529
 Always show the device is again 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.970
 So, a big one has grown up 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:27.390
 bolide the nano million has front and 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.529
 Aluminum buttons I'll show you quite a bit 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.730
 like here in front 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.350
 the buttons the buttons for you to see 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.710
 could what the device has so everything and 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.579
 can 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.579
 we see here again as I said 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:45.420
 hdmi 7 input because you can front one 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.059
 connect a camera or usb an ipod 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.200
 or iphone 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.719
 here are a few small things 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.140
 we'll just have a look 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.820
 very short to elisabeth happ that is 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.719
 you can also do that and use it 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:04.250
 image networked distributed in the house and sound 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:08.030
 then we have the new denon link hd 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.619
 This is now perks 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.030
 not recorded as at the time 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.909
 other dishes from those by 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.060
 network and perks that goes seven 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.240
 inputs hdmi and outputs like hdmi 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.400
 exits the three can, for example 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.830
 a sound a picture transmitted 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.170
 and another sound and picture at the same time 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.450
 in other room and the third socket 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.909
 can be used independently to 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.869
 example the bedroom for example 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:40.020
 with picture and sound as at 4 k 4 k worth 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.750
 also played high by this device 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.740
 is when you play once a film 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:50.130
 with 2k or 27 14 80 p we can 4k 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:54.210
 this can be done too, for example 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.159
 very good the new sony 1000 and then 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.600
 Can you say with the Danes directly 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.579
 connect the four source 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.759
 We hope that next year 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.200
 will be more enjoyable with 4k me 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.750
 go times now on the back of the 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:11.099
 device and show here again completely 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:13.230
 like the outside inputs 479 the hd link 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.410
 as I said the messed up plays drives 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.500
 the 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.740
 have the antenna for radio fm4 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.210
 readers next network jacks here 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.710
 below we have tricker that again 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.110
 means that we can again to the 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.520
 turn on the screen or shut down 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.850
 beamer assumes 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.760
 Here the boxes are denon 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:35.610
 speaker boxes here a cap 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.890
 but you have a lot on it 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.750
 Just remove it then here 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.400
 Bananas stronger from the 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.800
 plug in the loudspeaker cable 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.750
 in the past five years ago 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.700
 you could not get these cards yet 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.680
 The simplest thing you have to do with that 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.290
 screwdriver erupting with violence 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.480
 that is the reason that years ago only 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.340
 a child a power plug in this 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.200
 devices and has one 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.670
 got electric shock and there has the 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.800
 industry the regulation also receive 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.210
 to make boxers on it and the 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.280
 Now we have very flexible that you 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.230
 Immediately take what you can 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.780
 here we are here now 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.590
 nor component which has remained her 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:16.470
 at the device g7 these cures three hdmi 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:21.959
 exits and at least the seven 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:25.020
 inputs still analog audio again 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.940
 everything and playout is for example 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.870
 you are allowed to have extra external power amplifiers 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.360
 wants to use 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.100
 it is also suitable for that 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.950
 external close to play 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:38.100
 yes I wanted you to get this once 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.450
 By the way, the device has exactly the same 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:44.030
 still spotify 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:47.100
 this is for example for internetradio 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.780
 Here's even the device can be 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.880
 just stop airplay that means we 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.500
 For example, here he should express 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.680
 from apple 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.870
 the web is brought into the network and already 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.520
 Can you use the music with this device in 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.370
 bring a space and can in this 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:05.130
 simply music of which now 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.120
 about playing without great cables yet 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:10.190
 relocate 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:14.370
 that's exactly what the company was like cinema 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:17.310
