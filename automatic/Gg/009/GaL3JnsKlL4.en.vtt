00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
of light created yet so therefore there

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.949 
of light created yet so therefore there
couldn't<00:02:10.170> be<00:02:10.259> any<00:02:10.709> lights<00:02:11.459> on<00:02:11.760> day<00:02:12.030> one<00:02:12.360> so

couldn't be any lights on day one so

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.150 
couldn't be any lights on day one so
there<00:02:13.110> was<00:02:13.200> obviously<00:02:13.530> not<00:02:13.800> a

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
there was obviously not a

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.830 
there was obviously not a
night<00:02:14.490> on<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.760> first<00:02:14.970> day<00:02:15.180> because<00:02:15.330> there<00:02:15.690> was

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
night on the first day because there was

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.290

no<00:02:15.990> Sun<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.410> Moon<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.680> stars<00:02:16.800> created<00:02:17.370> yet<00:02:17.580> so

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
no Sun and Moon and stars created yet so

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.630
