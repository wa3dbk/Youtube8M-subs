00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
short is kobe was anything on this team

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:18.840 
short is kobe was anything on this team
with<00:01:16.939> Dwight<00:01:17.180> Howard<00:01:17.570> it'd<00:01:17.840> be<00:01:18.170> a<00:01:18.200> lot<00:01:18.500> easier

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
with Dwight Howard it'd be a lot easier

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.429 
with Dwight Howard it'd be a lot easier
to<00:01:19.850> just<00:01:20.060> play<00:01:20.210> against<00:01:20.479> the<00:01:20.570> team<00:01:20.810> Dwight<00:01:21.290> is

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
to just play against the team Dwight is

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:22.960 
to just play against the team Dwight is
that<00:01:21.649> by<00:01:21.920> how<00:01:22.100> is<00:01:22.220> the<00:01:22.310> only<00:01:22.460> force<00:01:22.729> on<00:01:22.850> this

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
that by how is the only force on this

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.999 
that by how is the only force on this
team<00:01:23.180> it<00:01:23.570> seemed<00:01:23.810> to<00:01:23.930> be<00:01:23.960> a<00:01:24.049> lot<00:01:24.170> simpler<00:01:24.530> this

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
team it seemed to be a lot simpler this

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.160 
team it seemed to be a lot simpler this
is<00:01:25.189> coby<00:01:25.579> Steve<00:01:25.820> Nash<00:01:26.060> and<00:01:26.329> everyone's<00:01:27.079> just

on<00:01:27.470> this<00:01:27.590> team<00:01:27.829> that<00:01:27.860> seemed<00:01:28.130> is<00:01:28.220> basically<00:01:28.640> an

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
on this team that seemed is basically an

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:30.459 
on this team that seemed is basically an
all-star<00:01:29.090> team<00:01:29.299> I<00:01:29.509> don't<00:01:30.020> care<00:01:30.140> what<00:01:30.290> it<00:01:30.350> was

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:30.469
