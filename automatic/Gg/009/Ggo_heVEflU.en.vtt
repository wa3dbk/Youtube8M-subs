finger again you hit it and you slide
down

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.110 

and<00:02:40.900> then<00:02:41.739> I<00:02:41.920> don't<00:02:42.099> I<00:02:42.430> can't<00:02:42.459> do<00:02:42.819> a<00:02:42.849> pic

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
and then I don't I can't do a pic

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.179 
and then I don't I can't do a pic
harmonic<00:02:43.569> to<00:02:43.689> this<00:02:43.840> so<00:02:44.049> I'm<00:02:44.170> going<00:02:44.799> to<00:02:44.890> slide

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:45.189 
harmonic to this so I'm going to slide

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:48.420 
harmonic to this so I'm going to slide
up<00:02:45.370> a<00:02:45.489> fret<00:02:45.760> your<00:02:46.920> middle<00:02:47.920> fingers<00:02:48.189> gonna<00:02:48.340> be

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
up a fret your middle fingers gonna be

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.649 
up a fret your middle fingers gonna be
on<00:02:48.519> the<00:02:48.609> second<00:02:48.939> straiten<00:02:49.209> you're<00:02:49.390> gonna<00:02:49.480> hit
