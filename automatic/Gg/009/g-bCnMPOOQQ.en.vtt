00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.020 
traditionally geo system audio has been
pretty<00:01:57.330> difficult<00:01:58.190> you<00:01:59.190> have<00:01:59.220> to<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.940> know

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
pretty difficult you have to you know

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.280 
pretty difficult you have to you know
kind<00:02:00.210> of<00:02:00.270> lug<00:02:00.420> around<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.720> whole<00:02:00.870> lot<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.050> gear

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
kind of lug around a whole lot of gear

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.940 
kind of lug around a whole lot of gear
and<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.670> can<00:02:02.790> get<00:02:02.850> pretty<00:02:03.000> expensive<00:02:03.180> as<00:02:03.630> well

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
and it can get pretty expensive as well

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.970 
and it can get pretty expensive as well
now<00:02:04.950> with<00:02:05.220> the<00:02:05.670> road<00:02:06.480> by<00:02:06.870> Chevy<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.830> can

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:07.980 
now with the road by Chevy you can

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.240 
now with the road by Chevy you can
actually<00:02:08.220> mount<00:02:08.430> the<00:02:08.880> XY<00:02:09.440> and<00:02:10.440> get<00:02:10.680> super<00:02:11.009> high

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
actually mount the XY and get super high

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.190 
actually mount the XY and get super high
definition<00:02:11.400> recording<00:02:11.970> directly<00:02:12.750> on<00:02:12.930> top<00:02:13.110> of

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
definition recording directly on top of

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.190 
definition recording directly on top of
the<00:02:13.290> camera<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:14.640> at<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.850> same<00:02:15.090> time<00:02:15.360> you<00:02:16.080> can

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
the camera and at the same time you can

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.120 
the camera and at the same time you can
actually<00:02:16.350> run<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:17.120> copy<00:02:18.120> of<00:02:18.270> that<00:02:18.300> track

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
actually run a copy of that track

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.920 
actually run a copy of that track
straight<00:02:20.130> into<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.580> microphone<00:02:21.360> input<00:02:21.600> from

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
straight into the microphone input from

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.729 
straight into the microphone input from
the<00:02:22.020> camera

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.319 

and<00:02:26.859> then<00:02:27.489> you've<00:02:27.609> got<00:02:27.640> scratch<00:02:27.969> already<00:02:28.239> on

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.329 
and then you've got scratch already on

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:30.209 
and then you've got scratch already on
your<00:02:28.480> camera<00:02:28.750> which<00:02:28.900> is<00:02:29.079> super<00:02:29.650> easy<00:02:29.680> to<00:02:29.920> sync

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:30.219 
your camera which is super easy to sync

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:31.770 
your camera which is super easy to sync
because<00:02:30.489> it's<00:02:30.640> basically<00:02:30.939> the<00:02:31.120> same<00:02:31.269> waveform

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
because it's basically the same waveform

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.720 
because it's basically the same waveform
and<00:02:32.049> you've<00:02:32.590> got<00:02:32.739> complete<00:02:33.159> dual<00:02:33.430> system

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
and you've got complete dual system
