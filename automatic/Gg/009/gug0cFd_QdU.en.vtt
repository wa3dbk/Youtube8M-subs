00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.519
 hello everyone I'm race or 96 and I like them 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:19.570
 my french fries like your mom 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:21.789
 hacks hashtags I come with a new 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.650
 video after the success of my last 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:25.779
 video that became my most watched video 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.150
 in just two more months that made my 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.949
 subscribers will double now 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.300
 let's start with this new video of 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.600
 criticize your fucking mother 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.580
 I say call of duty the famous game of 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.250
 activision that has become the game more 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.199
 popular in the universal universe so 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.479
 least was very successful in the seventh 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:45.519
 generation of consoles you have to wait for 

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:48.339
 see how it is doing in this current generation 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:50.589
 note that a game is successful 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:53.650
 It is necessarily a good game and call 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:55.600
 of duty is the perfect example let's see a 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.180
 little about its evolution when passing from 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.710
 time call of duty started as a 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.989
 Shooting game in first person 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.390
 based on the Second World War 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.690
 first it came out on pc and then on consoles 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.359
 in 2003 as well as call of duty 2 and 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.290
 3 that came out in 2005 and 2006 

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:13.390
 respectively 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.400
 with the very theme of the second 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.650
 world war these first three 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.290
 games went on sale in the sixth 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.170
 generation of consoles like ps2 and the 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.720
 xbox I also started from here 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.270
 the call of duty 4 modern warfare comes out 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.830
 this was the first call of duty that 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.260
 it came out on the seventh consoles 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.770
 generation of consoles like the ps3 and the 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.720
 xbox 360 was the first call of dutty that 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.270
 made his multiplayer worth it 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.910
 this is where they began to agglomerate 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.740
 fans of the franchise this game is 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.869
 the game that made the games of 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.460
 first-person shocks became 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.800
 a great pod in the world of 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.340
 video games based only on uploading 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.470
 level 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.750
 unlock weapons and kill players like that 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.820
 of simple and it's basically what you 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.009
 base all the games from here 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.800
 In addition, it is considered the best call of 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.960
 existing duty then came out the call of 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.240
 duty world at war where a 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.009
 zombies game mode very fun but 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.100
 the multiplayer's gameplay does not 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.320
 changed then the 2009 comes out the modern 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.420
 warfare 2 my favorite staff and the 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.220
 first that I bought by very simple that 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.010
 out for me is the best for his 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.320
 and in 2010 the call of duty black 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.270
 ops' that I also liked about the mode 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.100
 zombies and it was excellent but I already know 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.290
 The game in the 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.650
 graphics and maps were not so good 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:35.110
 the 2011 modern disaster happens 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.960
 warfare 3 was basically the same 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.940
 modern warfare 2 with worse maps almost 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.380
 the same weapons and basically everything 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.390
 same 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.310
 then in 2012 came the call of duty 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.620
 black ops 2 that I thought it would be so 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.180
 good as 1 but it did not turn out to be a 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.420
 first person shooting game 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.190
 ridiculous in every way the maps 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.230
 app were in the depths of the 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.540
 meaning of that word were of 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.880
 basically cartoon only walls where 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.070
 hide and holes to fall where the 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.020
 sniper had no place at least 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.090
 that you were a moron who uses it to short 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.280
 distance that I doubt that I war a 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.560
 really use it hitting the sight 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.430
 eye and spinning and screaming through the air 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:18.100
 quique idiots scouts in the end weapons 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.050
 they were fine nothing special and the 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.630
 game modes equal in all call 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.400
 of duty the zombie mode was a 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.200
 shit nothing compared to the zombies of 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.470
 black ops 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.450
 and this year 2013 came the call of duty 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.190
 ghosts I have played little but what 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.410
 Enough to say I do not want it 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.440
 play more and I threw by battlefield 4 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.300
 but do not think it's the worst in my 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.940
 opinion is better than black ops 2 and 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.580
 modern warfare 3 but simply in 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.410
 battlefield 4 looks much better at 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.569
 play it I realized that the weapons 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.700
 the maps are very good too 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.380
 they liked it a lot but it's still the 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.420
 same fucking game that always 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.480
 disappoints three months to stop it 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.580
 besides that the graphics suck but 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.650
 All these aspects are related to 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.340
 multiplayer that is not the problem of 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.260
 this game 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.959
 the problem for me are the players 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.090
 mainly another problem is that no 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.579
 has changed virtually nothing during 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.980
 the last seven games although without 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:16.380
 generalize the biggest change was black 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.570
 ops 2 to call of duty ghosts and that's from 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.549
 respect even a little bit just because 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.979
 I noticed the changes and it feels a bit more 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.960
 ordered at least for now that the 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:27.210
 game is new and even the idiots do not 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.550
 they discover how to ruin it like in all 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.729
 the others something I do think I can 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.219
 rescue from this game is the campaign 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:36.469
 the story is always very interesting 

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:38.960
 not as much as the gameplay that is very 

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:40.879
 linear but the story is worth it to me 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.830
 seem the best is that of black ops 1 

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:46.219
 followed by ghosts and then black 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.349
 ops 2 and then the modern warfare but at 

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:50.839
 get all this data about the games 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:54.229
 there is a question on the air and please 

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:55.909
 gave me is of call of duty because if the 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:57.680
 game was so good before and has not 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:05:00.080
 changed nothing over the years 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.490
 because now we say that the game is 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.630
 bad 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:10.240
 that's a good question idiot fan 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:15.110
 thanks greet me your mom idiot fan 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:17.270
 shit the answer to that question is 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.849
 very simple the evolution of the 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.830
 video games just when it came out 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:24.110
 modern warfare the quality of the games 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.060
 It was not so good games were found 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.729
 that were at their same quality level 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.080
 graphic and everything else going on from the 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:32.599
 years the game has remained 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.849
 basically the same graphics do not 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:36.860
 can call improved and players 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:39.139
 they have become more idiots and the games 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.090
 that are coming out next to the call of duty 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:43.789
 newest that is the ghosts are a lot 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:46.819
 but much better than what they were before 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:48.919
 as for example for field 4 that 

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:50.210
 it has some great destructible maps 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:52.400
 GTA 5 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.319
 infamous second are from steam and that is a 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.539
 call of duty mixed with halo in a 

00:05:54.319 --> 00:06:00.080
 massive multiplayer that so cool is 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:02.210
 that plus many more games and that's 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.620
 the reason why call of duty happened 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.199
 from being good game to bad game 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.210
 staying the same always but if you 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:10.160
 you want to buy a call of duty 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:13.190
 problem for the tastes are the 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.110
 colors and whores anyway as I said 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.419
 not everything is bad in this game the 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.069
 campaigns are short but fun and 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:21.289
 the extra modes like zombies or 

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:23.840
 extinction are much more fun than 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:26.840
 the multiplayer see you in a next 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.940
 video subscribe to carrot squat already arrived 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.919
