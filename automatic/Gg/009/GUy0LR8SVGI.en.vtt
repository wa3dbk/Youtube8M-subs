00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
glitch and it's quite cool to get out

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.310 
glitch and it's quite cool to get out
just<00:01:36.210> do<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.420> same<00:01:36.630> we<00:01:36.750> go<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.110> door

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
which I just shot and then I've got a

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.030 
which I just shot and then I've got a
clever<00:01:39.840> man<00:01:40.049> at<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.259> end<00:01:40.439> as<00:01:40.590> well<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:40.979> you

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
clever man at the end as well so you

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.639 
clever man at the end as well so you
guys<00:01:41.250> can<00:01:41.520> see<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.570> this<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.409> what<00:01:43.560> the

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
guys can see that and this is what the

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.499 
guys can see that and this is what the
map<00:01:43.799> looks<00:01:43.829> like<00:01:44.130> inside<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.939> quite<00:01:45.149> like

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
map looks like inside is quite like

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.670 
map looks like inside is quite like
small<00:01:45.869> quite<00:01:46.290> weird

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
small quite weird

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.889 
small quite weird
some<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.250> stuff<00:01:47.490> isn't<00:01:47.820> actually<00:01:48.270> there

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
some of the stuff isn't actually there

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.679 
some of the stuff isn't actually there
it's<00:01:49.170> like<00:01:49.490> there's<00:01:50.490> like<00:01:50.670> no<00:01:50.909> barrier<00:01:51.360> on<00:01:51.540> it

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
it's like there's like no barrier on it

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:52.550 
it's like there's like no barrier on it
if<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:51.840> makes<00:01:52.170> sense

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
if that makes sense

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.800
