00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.379
 explain more or less know the pace of 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.459
 the song that I want more from you and that's 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:16.459
 a video response 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:23.769
 a friend a brother that I leave there in the 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.090
 channel concept out the rhythm then 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:28.029
 I will try to explain so 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.210
 simple the rhythm or use would be the 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.210
 following 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.940
 then we started 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.200
 part by part let's start first 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.550
 saying 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.760
 in this rhythm their honors guides 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:01.430
 and top up descending and 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:05.239
 ascending for this case 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:08.480
 I will try to focus on what is the 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.090
 right hand not so much in the 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.810
 in the left hand 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:16.540
 then it would be the kingdom 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:20.230
 you would hear Asia more or less 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:25.690
 explain would be like that then 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:28.740
 the 13th rhythm would be first down 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.740
 next up 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:37.750
 then down then up and down 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.910
 that is a first sentence 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.409
 from what is the pace that would be no 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.040
 low 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.670
 above 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:50.650
 down up and down 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.650
 that yes with rhythm would be heard well 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.920
 for this to play with a 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:09.310
 with the right hand I use the finger 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.580
 index down and with the thumb towards 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.580
 above 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.060
 and 5a but already with could it be and so 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.970
 if they want at the moment of doing it towards 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.450
 above it is not necessary to take all 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.910
 the ropes 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.910
 If you want the first 300 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.900
 it would be like that would be down upstairs down 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.900
 up and down 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:55.150
 then the first sentence of what is 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:59.700
 the rhythm after would be like this after 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.700
 start with 1 upwards down 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.900
 and up is when it happens to the 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.900
 next take 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.239
 and he would listen to himself 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.820
 in the first part in the second part 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.820
 It starts like this 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.970
 and the second part would be heard 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:35.310
 and nothing is finished 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.310
 upwards 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.600
 and the change of disorder 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.890
 completely and deeply the first 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.890
 phrase I will listen like this 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.010
 and there we change the tone that would be 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:58.340
 pure down and up 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:01.180
 I think I do not have much much 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.180
 difficulty is not up towards 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.180
 above 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.910
 the phrase after the second well 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:17.060
 it would be like this 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.160
 would have I had participated in playing and 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.340
 this would be if the first part would be 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.340
 A) Yes 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.639
 it's a cherry depressor 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.010
 and already way you according 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.390
 do not 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.810
 i 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:44.600
 would be the rhythm then that would be all 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.890
 from me but that has been a blessing 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.860
 for your life 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:50.570
 this is minis the then any doubt 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.550

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.710
