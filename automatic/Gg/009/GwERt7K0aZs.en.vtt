know it says that you should have a
torque<00:03:24.390> wrench<00:03:24.600> if<00:03:24.810> you<00:03:24.870> guys<00:03:24.989> don't<00:03:25.170> have<00:03:25.200> a

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
torque wrench if you guys don't have a

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.270 
torque wrench if you guys don't have a
torque<00:03:25.530> wrench<00:03:26.000> just<00:03:27.049> feel<00:03:28.049> the<00:03:28.680> screw<00:03:29.069> as

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
torque wrench just feel the screw as

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.920 
torque wrench just feel the screw as
it's<00:03:29.459> coming<00:03:29.670> out<00:03:29.850> and<00:03:30.000> see<00:03:30.269> how<00:03:30.390> tight<00:03:30.660> it<00:03:30.810> is

right and then you know just measure

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.309 
right and then you know just measure
that<00:03:34.530> tightness<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:35.400> then<00:03:35.790> apply<00:03:36.239> that<00:03:36.319> same

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
that tightness and then apply that same

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.770 
that tightness and then apply that same
tightness<00:03:37.859> that<00:03:38.010> you<00:03:38.130> felt<00:03:38.569> unscrewing<00:03:39.569> it

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
so that's that side you come around to

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.800

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.620 
the left side I'm sorry the right side
this<00:04:35.250> another<00:04:36.250> thing<00:04:36.490> that<00:04:36.580> I<00:04:36.610> fail<00:04:36.970> to<00:04:37.270> tell

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
this another thing that I fail to tell

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.900 
this another thing that I fail to tell
you<00:04:37.780> guys<00:04:37.930> is<00:04:37.990> that<00:04:38.440> the<00:04:38.860> right<00:04:39.040> side<00:04:39.310> frame

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
you guys is that the right side frame

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.970 
you guys is that the right side frame
slider<00:04:40.240> is<00:04:40.450> much<00:04:40.660> shorter<00:04:40.900> than<00:04:41.320> the<00:04:41.470> left<00:04:41.680> so

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
slider is much shorter than the left so

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.490 
slider is much shorter than the left so
don't<00:04:42.160> go<00:04:42.370> install<00:04:42.820> the<00:04:43.030> short<00:04:43.390> one<00:04:44.080> on<00:04:44.110> the

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
don't go install the short one on the

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.800 
don't go install the short one on the
left<00:04:45.280> side<00:04:45.490> because<00:04:45.970> then<00:04:46.240> it<00:04:46.480> defeats<00:04:46.690> the

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
left side because then it defeats the

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:47.760 
left side because then it defeats the
purpose<00:04:46.870> you<00:04:47.290> know<00:04:47.380> what<00:04:47.470> I<00:04:47.500> mean

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
purpose you know what I mean

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.470 
purpose you know what I mean
and<00:04:47.980> this<00:04:48.370> one<00:04:48.580> it<00:04:48.700> tells<00:04:48.910> you<00:04:49.150> you<00:04:49.360> know

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480

remove this if you want to actually this

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:54.750 
remove this if you want to actually this

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.520 
because it's impossible for this to
touch<00:05:37.300> the<00:05:37.419> ferry<00:05:37.660> now<00:05:37.720> if<00:05:37.900> this<00:05:38.050> is<00:05:38.260> touching

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
touch the ferry now if this is touching

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:39.960 
touch the ferry now if this is touching
the<00:05:38.590> fairing<00:05:38.890> for<00:05:38.919> some<00:05:39.160> odd<00:05:39.280> reason<00:05:39.310> then<00:05:39.790> you

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
the fairing for some odd reason then you

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:41.400 
the fairing for some odd reason then you
probably<00:05:40.180> got<00:05:40.450> the<00:05:40.480> wrong<00:05:40.570> set<00:05:40.960> for<00:05:41.140> your<00:05:41.260> bike

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410 
probably got the wrong set for your bike

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.530 
probably got the wrong set for your bike
so<00:05:42.340> make<00:05:42.520> sure<00:05:42.550> that<00:05:42.669> you<00:05:42.940> also<00:05:43.120> have<00:05:43.419> the

so make sure that you also have the

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.200 
so make sure that you also have the
right<00:05:43.690> set<00:05:43.960> right<00:05:44.740> okay<00:05:45.550> now<00:05:45.760> once<00:05:46.030> you

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210 
right set right okay now once you

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.480 
right set right okay now once you
tighten<00:05:46.750> this<00:05:47.020> it<00:05:47.260> says<00:05:47.470> 305<00:05:47.860> foot-pounds

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
tighten this it says 305 foot-pounds

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.260 
tighten this it says 305 foot-pounds
tighten<00:05:49.180> it<00:05:49.270> as<00:05:49.390> much<00:05:49.600> as<00:05:49.720> you<00:05:49.750> can<00:05:50.050> okay<00:05:51.040> and

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
tighten it as much as you can okay and

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.909 
tighten it as much as you can okay and
until<00:05:52.270> it's<00:05:52.419> really<00:05:52.750> really<00:05:52.990> tight<00:05:53.169> then<00:05:53.860> you

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 
until it's really really tight then you

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:55.380 
until it's really really tight then you
install<00:05:54.370> this<00:05:54.490> guy<00:05:54.700> and<00:05:54.880> again<00:05:55.060> you<00:05:55.180> put

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:55.390 
install this guy and again you put

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:59.520 
install this guy and again you put
Loctite<00:05:55.960> right<00:05:56.350> here<00:05:57.900> the<00:05:58.900> of<00:05:59.050> course<00:05:59.380> this

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530 
Loctite right here the of course this

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.180 
Loctite right here the of course this
would<00:05:59.710> be<00:05:59.830> exposed<00:06:00.190> so<00:06:00.490> let's<00:06:01.180> just<00:06:01.390> say<00:06:01.540> that

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
would be exposed so let's just say that

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.190 
would be exposed so let's just say that
down<00:06:03.190> in<00:06:03.340> the<00:06:03.400> frame<00:06:03.580> slider<00:06:03.790> right<00:06:03.970> here<00:06:04.200> and

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:05.200 
down in the frame slider right here and

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.140 
down in the frame slider right here and
let's<00:06:05.380> say<00:06:05.500> this<00:06:05.680> would<00:06:05.860> be<00:06:05.890> exposed<00:06:06.370> you

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
let's say this would be exposed you

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.940 
let's say this would be exposed you
would<00:06:07.330> go<00:06:07.480> ahead<00:06:07.600> and<00:06:07.960> apply<00:06:08.200> a<00:06:08.230> lock<00:06:08.560> tied<00:06:08.800> to

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:08.950 
would go ahead and apply a lock tied to

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.870 
would go ahead and apply a lock tied to
that<00:06:09.130> and<00:06:09.340> then<00:06:09.720> you<00:06:10.720> would<00:06:10.930> apply<00:06:11.800> this

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:11.880 
that and then you would apply this

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.200 
that and then you would apply this
tighten<00:06:12.880> it<00:06:13.000> and<00:06:13.120> in<00:06:13.630> here<00:06:14.100> lies<00:06:15.100> an<00:06:15.550> 8

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.210 
tighten it and in here lies an 8

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.390 
tighten it and in here lies an 8
millimeter<00:06:16.480> hex<00:06:16.870> you<00:06:17.620> go<00:06:17.770> ahead<00:06:17.890> and<00:06:18.100> tighten

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 
millimeter hex you go ahead and tighten

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.909
