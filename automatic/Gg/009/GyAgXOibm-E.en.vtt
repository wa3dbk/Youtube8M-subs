112 I went in to a very rare monthly
which<00:04:35.370> meant<00:04:35.699> the<00:04:35.819> Kowalski<00:04:36.599> as<00:04:37.110> go<00:04:37.729> through

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
which meant the Kowalski as go through

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:44.059 
which meant the Kowalski as go through
the<00:04:38.940> steps<00:04:42.110> to<00:04:43.110> do<00:04:43.229> that<00:04:43.470> you're<00:04:43.770> a<00:04:43.919> little

the steps to do that you're a little

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:48.980 
the steps to do that you're a little
talk<00:04:44.340> to<00:04:44.639> your<00:04:45.180> science<00:04:45.780> officer<00:04:46.129> I<00:04:47.870> went<00:04:48.870> the

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
talk to your science officer I went the

00:04:48.990 --> 00:05:00.340 
talk to your science officer I went the
wrong<00:04:49.110> way<00:04:50.330> science<00:04:51.330> officer

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:08.450

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.300 
fail the mission so that's it after you

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.210 
fail the mission so that's it after you
do<00:05:50.450> that<00:05:50.480> you<00:05:50.660> will<00:05:50.930> have<00:05:51.110> a<00:05:51.140> mark<00:05:51.470> 12<00:05:51.890> and<00:05:54.220> very

but<00:06:20.960> there's<00:06:21.590> a<00:06:21.710> different<00:06:22.130> reward<00:06:22.580> if<00:06:22.880> you're

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:23.540 
but there's a different reward if you're

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.380 
but there's a different reward if you're
doing<00:06:23.780> it<00:06:23.900> during<00:06:24.410> normal<00:06:24.770> hours<00:06:25.130> as<00:06:25.610> opposed

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:26.390 
doing it during normal hours as opposed

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.130 
doing it during normal hours as opposed
to<00:06:26.600> doing<00:06:26.780> it<00:06:27.040> during<00:06:28.040> the<00:06:28.310> actual<00:06:28.790> event<00:06:29.140> you

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:30.140 
to doing it during the actual event you

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.990 
to doing it during the actual event you
want<00:06:30.290> to<00:06:30.410> do<00:06:30.560> it<00:06:30.710> during<00:06:30.920> the<00:06:31.190> actual<00:06:31.580> event

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 
want to do it during the actual event

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.030 
want to do it during the actual event
because<00:06:32.840> that's<00:06:33.110> when<00:06:33.320> the<00:06:33.470> riemann<00:06:33.860> data

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:34.040 
because that's when the riemann data

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:38.680 
because that's when the riemann data
logs<00:06:34.340> are<00:06:34.730> the<00:06:34.910> reward<00:06:37.090> so<00:06:38.090> there<00:06:38.510> you<00:06:38.660> go

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:38.690 
logs are the reward so there you go

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.780 
logs are the reward so there you go
that's<00:06:38.990> how<00:06:39.200> you<00:06:39.290> picture<00:06:39.890> Raymond<00:06:40.520> shield

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:40.790 
that's how you picture Raymond shield

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:42.850 
that's how you picture Raymond shield
and<00:06:41.030> how<00:06:41.120> you<00:06:41.180> upgrade<00:06:41.690> it<00:06:41.840> it's<00:06:42.620> not<00:06:42.800> that

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:42.860 
and how you upgrade it it's not that

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.180 
and how you upgrade it it's not that
hard<00:06:43.250> the<00:06:43.940> hardest<00:06:44.240> part<00:06:44.360> is<00:06:44.720> probably

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:45.190 
hard the hardest part is probably

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.740 
hard the hardest part is probably
