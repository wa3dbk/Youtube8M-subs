time easy driving the other main feature
of<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:54.000> board<00:00:54.210> is<00:00:54.360> actually<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:55.410> deck<00:00:56.039> the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
of the board is actually the deck the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.029 
of the board is actually the deck the
concave<00:00:56.879> deck<00:00:57.120> on<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.809> on<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.710> nose<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:58.890> the

concave deck on the on the nose of the

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.580 
concave deck on the on the nose of the
board<00:00:59.219> which<00:00:59.789> allows<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.510> first<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.500> all

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
board which allows you to first of all

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.900 
board which allows you to first of all
reduce<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.039> volume<00:01:02.340> on<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.579> nose<00:01:02.699> section

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
reduce the volume on the nose section

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.060 
reduce the volume on the nose section
which<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.539> weight<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.290> in<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.559> end<00:01:04.710> allow

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
which is the weight and in the end allow

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.000 
which is the weight and in the end allow
you<00:01:05.129> also<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.820> better<00:01:06.210> trim<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.229> your<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.950> your

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
you also a better trim of your of your

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.920 
you also a better trim of your of your
rig<00:01:08.610> while<00:01:09.060> you're<00:01:09.240> sailing<00:01:09.450> with<00:01:09.630> different

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
rig while you're sailing with different

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.740 
rig while you're sailing with different
sizes<00:01:10.340> the<00:01:11.340> other<00:01:11.460> great<00:01:11.729> important<00:01:12.299> feature

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
sizes the other great important feature

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.750 
sizes the other great important feature
of<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.049> board<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.530> actually<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.610> high

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
of the board is actually that the high

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.120 
of the board is actually that the high
configuration<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:15.990> changed<00:01:16.619> compared<00:01:17.040> to

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
configuration is changed compared to

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.640 
configuration is changed compared to
last<00:01:17.280> year<00:01:17.549> where<00:01:17.880> we<00:01:17.909> have<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.390> complete<00:01:18.900> V<00:01:19.140> in

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
last year where we have a complete V in

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.530 
last year where we have a complete V in
the<00:01:19.740> front<00:01:20.009> right<00:01:20.610> towards<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.060> middle<00:01:21.420> and

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
the front right towards the middle and

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.920 
the front right towards the middle and
going<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.110> disappear<00:01:22.710> towards<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.220> tail<00:01:23.430> and

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
going to disappear towards the tail and

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.420 
going to disappear towards the tail and
of<00:01:24.930> course<00:01:25.290> together<00:01:25.500> with<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.860> V<00:01:25.979> complete

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
of course together with the V complete

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.160 
of course together with the V complete
combination<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.450> scoop<00:01:27.689> rocker<00:01:27.930> line

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
combination the scoop rocker line

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.819 
combination the scoop rocker line
changes<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.270> we<00:01:30.270> have<00:01:30.299> one<00:01:31.079> board<00:01:31.409> which<00:01:31.680> is

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
changes and we have one board which is

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.039 
changes and we have one board which is
135<00:01:32.430> liter<00:01:32.759> which<00:01:32.909> is<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.150> shortest<00:01:33.600> one<00:01:33.810> and

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
135 liter which is the shortest one and

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.289 
135 liter which is the shortest one and
the<00:01:34.530> 90<00:01:34.799> liters<00:01:35.130> which<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.790> longest<00:01:36.150> one

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
the 90 liters which is the longest one

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.120 
the 90 liters which is the longest one
because<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.049> used<00:01:37.439> completely<00:01:37.979> two<00:01:38.100> different

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
because it used completely two different

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.609 
because it used completely two different
type<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.579> trims<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.360> water<00:01:39.570> with<00:01:40.229> light

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
type of trims in the water with light

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.740 
type of trims in the water with light
winds<00:01:40.890> use<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.189> bigger<00:01:41.460> sail<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.150> with<00:01:42.420> heavy

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
winds use a bigger sail and with heavy

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.600 
winds use a bigger sail and with heavy
weight<00:01:42.990> into<00:01:43.200> this<00:01:43.350> smaller<00:01:43.860> sail<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.369> for

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
weight into this smaller sail that for

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.870 
weight into this smaller sail that for
you<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:45.360> have<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.950> shorter<00:01:46.950> board<00:01:47.369> for

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
you it to have a shorter board for

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.490 
you it to have a shorter board for
lighter<00:01:48.060> winds<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.720> much<00:01:48.930> longer<00:01:49.259> board

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
lighter winds and a much longer board

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.560 
lighter winds and a much longer board
for<00:01:50.189> strong<00:01:50.520> winds<00:01:50.759> when<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.180> actually<00:01:51.270> want

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
for strong winds when you actually want

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.590 
for strong winds when you actually want
