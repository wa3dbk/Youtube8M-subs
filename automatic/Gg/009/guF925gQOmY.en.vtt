bedside manners now walking into a

patient's room can be pretty anxiety
inducing<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:30.000> think<00:00:30.210> walking<00:00:30.510> up<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.960> a

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
inducing and I think walking up to a

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.650 
inducing and I think walking up to a
one-ton<00:00:31.619> animal<00:00:32.070> who<00:00:32.309> can<00:00:32.730> kick<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.239> bite<00:00:33.420> is

one-ton animal who can kick and bite is

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.040 
one-ton animal who can kick and bite is
just<00:00:33.719> as<00:00:34.710> anxiety<00:00:34.860> inducing<00:00:35.809> first<00:00:36.809> thing<00:00:36.960> we

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
just as anxiety inducing first thing we

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.630 
just as anxiety inducing first thing we
had<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.230> do<00:00:37.410> was<00:00:37.590> actually<00:00:37.890> just<00:00:38.010> go<00:00:38.250> up<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.550> the

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
had to do was actually just go up to the

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.270 
had to do was actually just go up to the
horse<00:00:38.930> until<00:00:39.930> you<00:00:40.469> felt<00:00:40.680> comfortable<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.219> the

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
horse until you felt comfortable and the

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.950 
horse until you felt comfortable and the
horse<00:00:41.460> felt<00:00:41.790> comfortable<00:00:42.090> as<00:00:42.270> well<00:00:42.450> reading

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
horse felt comfortable as well reading

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.690 
horse felt comfortable as well reading
its<00:00:43.140> body<00:00:43.320> language<00:00:43.829> reading<00:00:44.129> if<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.520> runs

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
its body language reading if it runs

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.600 
its body language reading if it runs
away<00:00:44.850> from<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.239> if<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.480> runs<00:00:45.629> towards<00:00:46.110> you

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
away from you if it runs towards you

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.369 
away from you if it runs towards you
picking<00:00:47.610> up<00:00:47.730> small<00:00:48.180> details<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.289> would

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
picking up small details that you would

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.049 
picking up small details that you would
never<00:00:49.590> notice<00:00:49.829> with<00:00:50.100> another<00:00:50.340> human<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.940> think

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
never notice with another human I think

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.270 
never notice with another human I think
working<00:00:51.629> with<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.020> horses<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.800> learn<00:00:53.010> about

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
working with the horses to learn about

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.580 
working with the horses to learn about
body<00:00:53.610> language<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.180> longer<00:00:54.989> communication

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
body language and longer communication

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.279 
body language and longer communication
works<00:00:55.860> because<00:00:56.640> horses<00:00:57.090> are<00:00:57.329> able<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.660> elicit

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
works because horses are able to elicit

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.029 
works because horses are able to elicit
a<00:00:58.739> very<00:00:59.640> honest<00:01:00.000> mirror<00:01:00.359> as<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:01.590> what<00:01:01.829> your

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
a very honest mirror as to what your

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.609 
a very honest mirror as to what your
body<00:01:02.250> language<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:03.090> at<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.809> moment<00:01:04.049> when<00:01:04.530> I

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
body language is at that moment when I

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:05.870 
body language is at that moment when I
say<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:04.979> clearly<00:01:05.220> because<00:01:05.430> it's<00:01:05.700> really

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
say that clearly because it's really

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.100 
say that clearly because it's really
about<00:01:06.000> present<00:01:06.390> moment<00:01:06.720> it's<00:01:06.810> what<00:01:06.960> are<00:01:07.049> you

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
about present moment it's what are you

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.679 
about present moment it's what are you
displaying<00:01:07.500> right<00:01:07.770> now<00:01:08.390> the<00:01:09.390> way<00:01:09.510> you're

interacting<00:01:10.020> with<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.290> horse<00:01:10.530> really<00:01:11.040> reflects

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
interacting with a horse really reflects

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.609 
interacting with a horse really reflects
how<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.670> approach<00:01:12.659> people<00:01:12.900> how<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.320> approach
