something<00:02:26.100> amazing<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:26.790> make<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.030> full-on

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
something amazing and make a full-on

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.720 
something amazing and make a full-on
montage<00:02:27.989> or<00:02:28.290> you<00:02:28.470> know<00:02:28.620> what<00:02:28.860> hold<00:02:29.310> on<00:02:29.489> I<00:02:29.700> have

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
montage or you know what hold on I have

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.940 
montage or you know what hold on I have
a<00:02:29.880> better<00:02:30.090> idea<00:02:30.150> what<00:02:30.720> if<00:02:30.810> I<00:02:30.930> do<00:02:30.989> a<00:02:31.200> top<00:02:31.590> five<00:02:31.620> of

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
a better idea what if I do a top five of

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.190 
a better idea what if I do a top five of
those<00:02:32.340> I<00:02:32.700> do<00:02:32.970> feel<00:02:33.269> like<00:02:33.360> a<00:02:33.450> top<00:02:33.660> five<00:02:33.900> would<00:02:34.170> be

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
those I do feel like a top five would be

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.199 
those I do feel like a top five would be
better<00:02:34.530> so<00:02:34.950> maybe<00:02:35.220> each<00:02:35.489> week<00:02:35.760> i<00:02:35.880> can<00:02:36.030> pick

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
better so maybe each week i can pick

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.910 
better so maybe each week i can pick
five<00:02:36.420> different<00:02:36.840> people<00:02:37.170> but<00:02:37.440> overall<00:02:37.650> the
