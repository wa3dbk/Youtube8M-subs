battery life on this now I'm going to
close<00:01:20.250> this<00:01:20.430> up<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.820> give<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.060> look<00:01:21.330> around

close this up and give you a look around

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.840 
close this up and give you a look around
how<00:01:21.930> small<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.770> but<00:01:22.979> before<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.400> close<00:01:23.670> I

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
how small this is but before I close I

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.820 
how small this is but before I close I
want<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.119> show<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.330> your<00:01:24.509> trick<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:25.680> is

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
want to show you your trick that this is

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.010 
want to show you your trick that this is
graphic<00:01:26.159> sleeve<00:01:26.460> not<00:01:27.060> sure<00:01:27.240> how<00:01:27.420> useful<00:01:27.689> this

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
graphic sleeve not sure how useful this

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.840 
graphic sleeve not sure how useful this
is<00:01:28.170> but<00:01:28.470> if<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.680> look<00:01:28.890> at<00:01:29.009> this<00:01:29.189> if<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.579> pull

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
is but if you look at this if I pull

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.569 
is but if you look at this if I pull
this<00:01:30.000> forwards<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.950> can<00:01:31.950> actually<00:01:32.070> push<00:01:32.400> the

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
this forwards I can actually push the

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.120 
this forwards I can actually push the
screen<00:01:32.850> down<00:01:33.439> until<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.590> flat<00:01:34.890> on<00:01:34.950> the

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
screen down until it is flat on the

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.980 
screen down until it is flat on the
table<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.299> can<00:01:36.540> use<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:37.079> on<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.500> table

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
table so you can use this on a table

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.109 
table so you can use this on a table
more<00:01:39.990> like<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.229> tablet<00:01:40.799> now<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.159> actual<00:01:41.820> hinge

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
more like a tablet now the actual hinge

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.789 
more like a tablet now the actual hinge
won't<00:01:42.360> go<00:01:42.509> all<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.869> way<00:01:42.899> around<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.710> only

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
won't go all the way around so it only

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.940 
won't go all the way around so it only
goes<00:01:43.920> into<00:01:44.340> this<00:01:44.460> flat<00:01:44.759> position<00:01:44.990> but<00:01:45.990> it's

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
goes into this flat position but it's

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.859 
goes into this flat position but it's
got<00:01:47.100> limited<00:01:47.369> uses<00:01:47.909> like<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.540> suppose

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
got limited uses like this I suppose

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.420 
got limited uses like this I suppose
it's<00:01:49.049> good<00:01:49.229> for<00:01:49.470> if<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.649> want<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.890> sort<00:01:50.399> of

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
it's good for if you want to sort of

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.039 
it's good for if you want to sort of
play<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.670> game<00:01:50.939> with<00:01:51.149> somebody<00:01:51.329> flat<00:01:51.810> on<00:01:51.960> the

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
play a game with somebody flat on the

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.740 
play a game with somebody flat on the
table<00:01:52.229> but<00:01:53.040> limited<00:01:53.579> use<00:01:53.759> but<00:01:54.000> nice<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.570> fact

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
table but limited use but nice the fact

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.660 
table but limited use but nice the fact
it<00:01:54.930> actually<00:01:55.229> does<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:56.310> once<00:01:56.490> I've<00:01:56.640> got

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
it actually does that and once I've got

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.609 
it actually does that and once I've got
it<00:01:56.850> on<00:01:56.909> this<00:01:57.119> particular<00:01:57.540> angle<00:01:57.840> for<00:01:58.259> you<00:01:58.409> I

it on this particular angle for you I

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.899 
it on this particular angle for you I

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
want to show you how thin it is when

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.969 
want to show you how thin it is when
it's<00:02:00.030> actually<00:02:00.210> closed<00:02:00.600> up<00:02:00.869> so<00:02:01.110> if<00:02:01.619> we<00:02:01.710> go<00:02:01.799> all

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
it's actually closed up so if we go all

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.819 
it's actually closed up so if we go all
the<00:02:02.100> way<00:02:02.130> over<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.790> close<00:02:03.270> this<00:02:03.509> up<00:02:03.689> look<00:02:04.680> at

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
the way over and close this up look at

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.369 
the way over and close this up look at
this<00:02:05.420> wow<00:02:06.420> this<00:02:07.259> is<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.829> very<00:02:08.369> very<00:02:09.000> thin

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379 
this wow this is a very very thin

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.720 
this wow this is a very very thin
ultrabook<00:02:10.379> let's<00:02:10.950> have<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.129> look<00:02:11.310> around<00:02:11.459> the

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
ultrabook let's have a look around the

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.700 
ultrabook let's have a look around the
pores<00:02:12.000> so<00:02:12.690> first<00:02:13.020> of<00:02:13.110> all<00:02:13.140> we've<00:02:13.290> got<00:02:13.319> the

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
pores so first of all we've got the

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.770 
pores so first of all we've got the
our<00:02:13.860> input<00:02:14.310> port<00:02:14.550> here<00:02:14.850> this<00:02:15.270> is<00:02:15.420> obviously

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
our input port here this is obviously

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.940 
our input port here this is obviously
for<00:02:16.170> charging

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
for charging

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.760 
for charging
we've<00:02:17.340> got<00:02:17.490> HDMI<00:02:18.060> out<00:02:18.210> headphone<00:02:19.110> port<00:02:19.410> power

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
we've got HDMI out headphone port power

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.800 
we've got HDMI out headphone port power
on/off<00:02:20.190> and<00:02:20.490> then<00:02:21.030> if<00:02:21.120> we<00:02:21.210> go<00:02:21.330> around<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.630> the

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
on/off and then if we go around to the

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.410 
on/off and then if we go around to the
front<00:02:22.080> sort<00:02:22.740> of<00:02:22.800> aspect<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:23.310> this<00:02:23.460> very<00:02:24.270> very

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
front sort of aspect to this very very

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.770 
front sort of aspect to this very very
thin<00:02:24.690> again<00:02:25.020> so<00:02:25.980> so<00:02:26.340> thin<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:26.940> then<00:02:27.480> if<00:02:27.570> we<00:02:27.660> go

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
thin again so so thin and then if we go

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.620 
thin again so so thin and then if we go
round<00:02:27.990> on<00:02:28.350> to<00:02:28.530> this<00:02:28.800> side<00:02:29.370> we<00:02:29.940> have<00:02:30.210> got<00:02:30.240> two

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
round on to this side we have got two

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.440 
round on to this side we have got two

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
on the back we just got some ventilation

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.660 
on the back we just got some ventilation
and<00:02:39.330> there<00:02:39.870> also<00:02:40.050> is<00:02:40.500> a<00:02:40.530> couple<00:02:40.860> of<00:02:40.920> LEDs<00:02:41.340> here

here we've just got what looks like some

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.140 
here we've just got what looks like some
more<00:03:01.350> ventilation<00:03:01.710> this<00:03:02.460> is<00:03:02.640> actually<00:03:03.000> where

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
more ventilation this is actually where

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.470 
more ventilation this is actually where
the<00:03:03.330> battery<00:03:03.900> resides<00:03:04.290> just<00:03:04.980> in<00:03:05.160> here<00:03:05.520> so

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
the battery resides just in here so

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.250 
the battery resides just in here so
let's<00:03:06.840> take<00:03:07.080> a<00:03:07.110> look<00:03:07.410> at<00:03:07.650> this<00:03:07.890> open<00:03:08.310> again<00:03:08.550> and

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
let's take a look at this open again and

let's take a look at this open again and
I'll<00:03:10.260> give<00:03:10.410> you<00:03:10.500> my<00:03:10.650> opinion<00:03:11.160> on<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:12.450> aspire

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
I'll give you my opinion on the aspire

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.760 
I'll give you my opinion on the aspire
s7<00:03:13.580> let's<00:03:14.580> first<00:03:14.880> of<00:03:15.030> all<00:03:15.060> take<00:03:15.330> a<00:03:15.570> look<00:03:15.870> at<00:03:16.170> the

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
s7 let's first of all take a look at the

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.010 
s7 let's first of all take a look at the
keyboard<00:03:17.060> so<00:03:18.060> let's<00:03:18.300> have<00:03:18.390> a<00:03:18.450> look<00:03:18.660> at<00:03:18.810> the

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
keyboard so let's have a look at the

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.530 
keyboard so let's have a look at the
construction<00:03:19.710> of<00:03:19.770> the<00:03:19.860> keyboard<00:03:20.310> and<00:03:20.520> this<00:03:21.270> is

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
construction of the keyboard and this is

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.810 
construction of the keyboard and this is
a<00:03:21.570> really<00:03:22.200> really<00:03:22.380> high<00:03:22.650> quality<00:03:22.820> it's

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
a really really high quality it's

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.640 
a really really high quality it's
actually<00:03:24.120> a<00:03:24.150> backlit<00:03:24.600> keyboard<00:03:24.660> so<00:03:25.320> we<00:03:25.410> do<00:03:25.530> get

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
actually a backlit keyboard so we do get

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.050 
actually a backlit keyboard so we do get
some<00:03:25.800> lighting<00:03:26.040> if<00:03:26.370> you're<00:03:26.490> using<00:03:26.670> this<00:03:26.910> in

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
some lighting if you're using this in

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.540 
some lighting if you're using this in
the<00:03:27.150> dark<00:03:27.330> we've<00:03:27.990> got<00:03:28.260> various<00:03:28.800> or<00:03:29.100> function

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550

the dark we've got various or function
keys<00:03:29.760> that<00:03:30.000> we<00:03:30.120> can<00:03:30.270> access<00:03:30.600> by<00:03:30.750> holding<00:03:31.050> down

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
keys that we can access by holding down

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.040 
keys that we can access by holding down
the<00:03:31.320> function<00:03:31.740> key<00:03:32.340> here<00:03:32.670> very<00:03:33.420> well<00:03:33.540> spaced

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050

the function key here very well spaced
very<00:03:34.280> low-profile<00:03:35.280> though<00:03:35.550> they<00:03:36.030> don't

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
very low-profile though they don't

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.820 
very low-profile though they don't
protrude<00:03:36.630> a<00:03:36.750> lot<00:03:36.870> from<00:03:37.020> the<00:03:37.140> actual<00:03:37.320> casing

during<00:06:56.860> this<00:06:56.979> review<00:06:57.219> it<00:06:57.879> doesn't<00:06:58.239> take<00:06:58.419> a<00:06:58.449> lot

00:06:58.889 --> 00:06:58.899 
during this review it doesn't take a lot

00:06:58.899 --> 00:07:00.749 
during this review it doesn't take a lot
to<00:06:58.959> actually<00:06:59.439> get<00:06:59.589> those<00:06:59.709> fans<00:07:00.099> to<00:07:00.309> turn<00:07:00.519> on

00:07:00.749 --> 00:07:00.759 
to actually get those fans to turn on

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:03.029 
to actually get those fans to turn on
but<00:07:01.360> that<00:07:01.509> said<00:07:01.839> they're<00:07:02.319> not<00:07:02.529> too<00:07:02.769> intrusive

00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:03.039 
but that said they're not too intrusive

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:05.789 
but that said they're not too intrusive
and<00:07:03.549> overall<00:07:04.299> this<00:07:04.479> is<00:07:04.539> a<00:07:04.689> great<00:07:05.139> performing

00:07:05.789 --> 00:07:05.799

laptop in such a small and compact
package<00:07:08.739> this<00:07:09.519> is<00:07:10.169> really<00:07:11.169> sort<00:07:11.829> of<00:07:11.889> thinner

00:07:12.149 --> 00:07:12.159 
package this is really sort of thinner

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:14.069 
package this is really sort of thinner
than<00:07:12.610> the<00:07:12.759> MacBook<00:07:12.939> Air<00:07:13.269> it<00:07:13.719> feels<00:07:13.899> a<00:07:13.989> little

00:07:14.069 --> 00:07:14.079 
than the MacBook Air it feels a little

00:07:14.079 --> 00:07:14.819 
than the MacBook Air it feels a little
bit<00:07:14.229> weightier

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:14.829 
bit weightier

00:07:14.829 --> 00:07:17.189 
bit weightier
and<00:07:15.610> maybe<00:07:15.819> not<00:07:16.029> as<00:07:16.089> portable<00:07:16.539> but<00:07:17.079> it

00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:17.199 
and maybe not as portable but it

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:18.839 
and maybe not as portable but it
certainly<00:07:17.439> is<00:07:17.709> thin<00:07:17.979> now<00:07:18.069> it<00:07:18.249> has<00:07:18.399> got<00:07:18.579> a<00:07:18.610> few

00:07:18.839 --> 00:07:18.849 
certainly is thin now it has got a few
