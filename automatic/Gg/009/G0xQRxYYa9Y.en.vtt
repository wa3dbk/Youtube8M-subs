00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.920 
he said I want to come up with some way
to<00:02:24.760> make<00:02:25.569> a<00:02:25.630> game<00:02:25.900> that<00:02:26.140> uses<00:02:26.620> this<00:02:27.040> character

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
to make a game that uses this character

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.920 
to make a game that uses this character
so<00:02:28.930> about<00:02:29.050> 10<00:02:29.290> minutes<00:02:29.440> later

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
so about 10 minutes later

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.860 
so about 10 minutes later
he'd<00:02:31.500> figured<00:02:31.859> it<00:02:31.980> out<00:02:32.099> and<00:02:32.430> a<00:02:33.299> thousand

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
he'd figured it out and a thousand

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.630 
he'd figured it out and a thousand
programming<00:02:34.680> hours<00:02:34.980> later<00:02:35.870> pitfall<00:02:36.870> was<00:02:37.019> born

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
programming hours later pitfall was born

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.160 
programming hours later pitfall was born
is<00:02:38.640> actually<00:02:39.150> one<00:02:39.390> of<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.659> most<00:02:39.930> successful

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
is actually one of the most successful

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.410 
is actually one of the most successful
games<00:02:40.920> that<00:02:41.340> ever<00:02:41.489> came<00:02:41.700> up<00:02:41.849> for<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.090> Atari

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.679 
at in the world of Atari games I'm
probably<00:02:52.799> making<00:02:52.980> this<00:02:53.219> really<00:02:53.849> easy<00:02:54.450> but

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:54.689 
probably making this really easy but

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:56.599 
probably making this really easy but
it's<00:02:54.870> not<00:02:55.049> now<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:55.590> don't<00:02:55.859> have<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.129> stay<00:02:56.489> up

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
it's not now you don't have to stay up

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.759 
it's not now you don't have to stay up
on<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.790> top<00:02:57.060> in<00:02:57.900> fact<00:02:58.079> some<00:02:58.290> of<00:02:58.349> the<00:02:58.500> treasure

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.949 
on the top in fact some of the treasure
is<00:02:59.040> actually<00:02:59.939> underground<00:03:00.359> so<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.629> next<00:03:00.750> time

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
is actually underground so the next time

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.740 
is actually underground so the next time
I<00:03:01.019> find<00:03:01.260> a<00:03:01.409> ladder<00:03:01.590> let's<00:03:01.920> go<00:03:02.069> down<00:03:02.750> whoo-hoo

I find a ladder let's go down whoo-hoo
that<00:03:04.019> was<00:03:04.169> close<00:03:04.700> here<00:03:05.700> we<00:03:05.760> go

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.600 

there<00:03:13.870> we<00:03:14.080> go<00:03:14.200> you<00:03:14.920> can<00:03:15.100> go<00:03:15.190> either<00:03:15.400> direction
