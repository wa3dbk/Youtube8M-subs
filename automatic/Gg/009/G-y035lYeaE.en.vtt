as<00:02:37.450> you're<00:02:37.600> recording<00:02:37.750> you<00:02:38.260> can<00:02:38.290> go<00:02:38.590> through

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
as you're recording you can go through

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.310 
as you're recording you can go through
and<00:02:38.950> you<00:02:38.980> can<00:02:39.310> put<00:02:39.370> markers<00:02:40.240> in<00:02:40.450> you<00:02:41.050> know<00:02:41.110> for

you get to export export don't see you
have<00:03:07.630> your<00:03:07.810> tracks<00:03:08.170> here<00:03:08.590> tracks<00:03:08.950> 15<00:03:09.340> 16<00:03:09.820> I

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
have your tracks here tracks 15 16 I

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.290 
have your tracks here tracks 15 16 I
recorded<00:03:10.660> with<00:03:10.960> two<00:03:11.230> microphones<00:03:11.800> and<00:03:12.300> on

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
recorded with two microphones and on

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.190 
recorded with two microphones and on
tracks<00:03:13.630> one<00:03:13.810> and<00:03:13.960> two<00:03:14.140> and<00:03:14.440> you<00:03:15.370> would<00:03:15.490> think

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
tracks one and two and you would think

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.630 
tracks one and two and you would think
go<00:03:17.200> in<00:03:17.320> tracks<00:03:17.620> 1<00:03:17.830> and<00:03:17.980> 2<00:03:18.130> that<00:03:18.340> would<00:03:18.460> make

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
go in tracks 1 and 2 that would make

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.000 
go in tracks 1 and 2 that would make
sense<00:03:18.910> but<00:03:19.600> what<00:03:19.810> it<00:03:19.930> does<00:03:20.140> is<00:03:20.410> it<00:03:20.530> mixes<00:03:20.830> it

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
sense but what it does is it mixes it

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.480 
sense but what it does is it mixes it
down<00:03:21.160> to<00:03:21.340> a<00:03:21.370> stereo<00:03:21.790> file<00:03:22.200> left<00:03:23.200> and<00:03:23.410> right<00:03:23.620> 1<00:03:24.340> &amp;

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
down to a stereo file left and right 1 &amp;

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.130 
down to a stereo file left and right 1 &amp;
2<00:03:24.610> respectively<00:03:24.760> and<00:03:25.390> that's<00:03:25.510> not<00:03:25.750> what<00:03:25.990> we

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
2 respectively and that's not what we

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.890 
2 respectively and that's not what we
want<00:03:26.470> because<00:03:27.190> I<00:03:27.490> use<00:03:27.670> two<00:03:27.940> very<00:03:28.690> different

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
want because I use two very different

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.470 
want because I use two very different
microphones<00:03:29.620> and<00:03:29.950> that<00:03:30.430> would<00:03:30.580> just<00:03:30.790> be<00:03:30.910> weird

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
microphones and that would just be weird

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.610 
microphones and that would just be weird
so<00:03:32.080> we'll<00:03:32.260> go<00:03:32.670> not<00:03:33.670> stereo<00:03:34.180> but<00:03:34.690> 1<00:03:34.900> through<00:03:35.230> 16

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
so we'll go not stereo but 1 through 16

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.830 
so we'll go not stereo but 1 through 16
and<00:03:36.370> even<00:03:36.610> though<00:03:36.730> it's<00:03:36.850> 1<00:03:37.060> through<00:03:37.270> 16<00:03:37.570> it's

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
and even though it's 1 through 16 it's

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.600 
and even though it's 1 through 16 it's
not<00:03:37.900> going<00:03:38.230> to<00:03:38.320> give<00:03:38.470> me<00:03:38.650> 16<00:03:39.040> separate<00:03:39.400> wav

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
not going to give me 16 separate wav

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.540 
not going to give me 16 separate wav
files<00:03:39.940> but<00:03:40.360> just<00:03:40.630> the<00:03:41.220> tracks<00:03:42.220> that<00:03:42.430> were

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
files but just the tracks that were

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.420 
files but just the tracks that were
recorded<00:03:43.030> on<00:03:43.290> so<00:03:44.290> you<00:03:45.010> know<00:03:45.100> we<00:03:45.220> go<00:03:45.400> through

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
recorded on so you know we go through

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.210 
recorded on so you know we go through
here<00:03:46.030> that's<00:03:46.450> our<00:03:46.630> beginning<00:03:47.050> time<00:03:47.260> in<00:03:47.650> our

here that's our beginning time in our

other<00:04:43.080> ones<00:04:43.350> I've<00:04:43.590> done<00:04:44.510> per<00:04:45.510> wave<00:04:46.229> track<00:04:46.680> it

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
other ones I've done per wave track it

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.010 
other ones I've done per wave track it
does<00:04:47.160> about<00:04:47.460> four<00:04:47.940> times<00:04:48.120> as<00:04:48.360> fast<00:04:48.389> as<00:04:48.780> real

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
does about four times as fast as real

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.129 
does about four times as fast as real
time<00:04:49.370> you<00:04:50.370> know<00:04:50.490> and<00:04:50.610> this<00:04:50.700> one<00:04:50.910> does<00:04:51.090> it<00:04:51.240> much

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 
time you know and this one does it much

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:57.620 
time you know and this one does it much
faster<00:04:53.900> so<00:04:54.900> it<00:04:55.320> would<00:04:55.470> have<00:04:55.590> taken<00:04:55.770> a<00:04:56.630> whole

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
faster so it would have taken a whole

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.510 
faster so it would have taken a whole
minute<00:04:57.960> just<00:04:58.110> to<00:04:58.229> do<00:04:58.410> that<00:04:58.590> that<00:04:59.040> much<00:04:59.280> with

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
minute just to do that that much with

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.900 
minute just to do that that much with
other<00:05:00.020> things<00:05:01.020> that<00:05:01.200> I<00:05:01.229> used<00:05:01.530> anyway<00:05:02.280> so<00:05:02.760> now

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
other things that I used anyway so now

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.850 
other things that I used anyway so now
that<00:05:02.970> we're<00:05:03.240> done<00:05:03.270> with<00:05:03.540> that<00:05:03.570> it's<00:05:04.530> on<00:05:04.710> the

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
that we're done with that it's on the

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.710 
that we're done with that it's on the
internal<00:05:05.280> memory<00:05:05.400> we<00:05:06.120> go<00:05:06.300> to<00:05:06.360> utility<00:05:06.990> and<00:05:08.720> you

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
internal memory we go to utility and you

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.420 
internal memory we go to utility and you
click<00:05:10.680> around<00:05:10.830> until<00:05:11.370> you<00:05:11.460> get<00:05:11.610> to<00:05:11.789> USB<00:05:12.620> now<00:05:13.620> if

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
click around until you get to USB now if

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.400 
click around until you get to USB now if
you've<00:05:14.580> never<00:05:15.080> connected<00:05:16.080> it<00:05:16.200> to<00:05:16.289> your

you've never connected it to your

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.890 
you've never connected it to your
computer<00:05:16.800> before<00:05:17.360> it<00:05:18.360> comes<00:05:18.660> with<00:05:18.810> an

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
computer before it comes with an

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:24.680 
computer before it comes with an
installation<00:05:19.229> disk<00:05:20.660> looks<00:05:21.660> like<00:05:21.900> that<00:05:23.690> you

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
installation disk looks like that you

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.490 
installation disk looks like that you
know<00:05:24.840> and<00:05:25.580> you<00:05:26.690> go<00:05:27.690> through<00:05:27.840> this<00:05:27.960> complicated

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
know and you go through this complicated

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.440 
know and you go through this complicated
process<00:05:28.610> it's<00:05:29.610> in<00:05:29.700> the<00:05:29.820> instruction<00:05:30.270> booklet

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
process it's in the instruction booklet

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.900 
process it's in the instruction booklet
but<00:05:31.289> basically<00:05:31.710> you<00:05:31.890> have<00:05:31.919> a<00:05:32.070> power<00:05:32.370> this

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910 
but basically you have a power this

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.680 
but basically you have a power this
thing<00:05:32.970> powered<00:05:33.539> off<00:05:33.630> first<00:05:35.300> you<00:05:36.300> upload<00:05:36.660> that

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
thing powered off first you upload that

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.340 
thing powered off first you upload that
on<00:05:36.960> your<00:05:37.080> computer<00:05:37.229> and<00:05:38.840> then<00:05:39.840> you<00:05:39.870> have<00:05:40.169> to

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
on your computer and then you have to

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.409 
on your computer and then you have to
you<00:05:40.590> know<00:05:40.680> just<00:05:40.919> install<00:05:41.340> the<00:05:41.490> Yamaha<00:05:41.910> USB
