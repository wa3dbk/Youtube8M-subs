00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.839 
smart choice for him and worked out so
at<00:00:25.949> what<00:00:26.099> point<00:00:26.130> did<00:00:26.519> you<00:00:26.670> start

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
at what point did you start

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.400 
at what point did you start
concentrating<00:00:27.330> more<00:00:27.750> on<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.930> hundred<00:00:28.260> as

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
concentrating more on the hundred as

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.860 
concentrating more on the hundred as
opposed<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.010> 200<00:00:31.309> probably<00:00:32.309> like<00:00:33.239> middle

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
opposed to the 200 probably like middle

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.220 
opposed to the 200 probably like middle
of<00:00:33.989> last<00:00:34.140> year<00:00:35.540> freshman<00:00:36.540> year<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.899> lot<00:00:37.079> of

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
of last year freshman year is a lot of

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.510 
of last year freshman year is a lot of
focus<00:00:37.530> on<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.010> 200<00:00:39.980> after<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.309> times

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
focus on the 200 after that of times

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.549 
focus on the 200 after that of times
worked<00:00:41.879> on<00:00:42.030> developing<00:00:42.180> speed<00:00:42.809> like<00:00:43.290> every

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
worked on developing speed like every

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.410 
worked on developing speed like every
year<00:00:43.820> hundreds<00:00:44.820> become<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.059> little<00:00:45.210> bit<00:00:45.300> more

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
year hundreds become a little bit more

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.080 
year hundreds become a little bit more
natural<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:46.500> mean<00:00:47.160> I<00:00:47.219> could<00:00:47.399> still<00:00:47.910> put

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
natural I mean I could still put

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.479 
natural I mean I could still put
together<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.570> good<00:00:48.899> center<00:00:49.200> fly<00:00:49.440> if<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.070> focus

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
together to a good center fly if I focus

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.330 
together to a good center fly if I focus
on<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.850> little<00:00:51.000> better<00:00:51.210> with

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
on that a little better with

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.830 
on that a little better with
I<00:00:52.460> think<00:00:52.880> the<00:00:52.970> hunters<00:00:53.240> comes<00:00:53.570> a<00:00:53.600> little<00:00:53.660> bit

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
I think the hunters comes a little bit

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.320 
I think the hunters comes a little bit
more<00:00:53.960> national<00:00:54.350> in<00:00:54.410> mesa<00:00:54.770> folks<00:00:55.250> on<00:00:55.430> that<00:00:55.460> it's

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:56.330 
more national in mesa folks on that it's

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.180 
more national in mesa folks on that it's
been<00:00:56.510> a<00:00:56.540> building<00:00:57.320> momentum<00:00:57.500> with<00:00:58.040> you

now talk about that progression and and
if<00:01:05.300> i<00:01:05.390> would<00:01:05.510> have<00:01:05.540> told<00:01:05.780> you<00:01:05.900> a<00:01:06.440> year<00:01:07.070> and<00:01:07.160> a

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
if i would have told you a year and a

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.920 
if i would have told you a year and a
half<00:01:07.220> ago<00:01:07.490> maybe<00:01:07.729> before<00:01:08.090> trials<00:01:08.450> that<00:01:08.660> you

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
half ago maybe before trials that you

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.140 
half ago maybe before trials that you
would<00:01:09.080> be<00:01:09.229> a<00:01:09.260> 51<00:01:09.830> one<00:01:10.070> on<00:01:10.250> your<00:01:10.430> way<00:01:10.550> to<00:01:10.610> Rome<00:01:10.970> on

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
would be a 51 one on your way to Rome on

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.660 
would be a 51 one on your way to Rome on
the<00:01:11.180> world<00:01:11.420> team<00:01:11.690> I<00:01:11.930> mean<00:01:12.619> how<00:01:12.979> believable<00:01:13.250> was

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
the world team I mean how believable was

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:14.920 
the world team I mean how believable was
that<00:01:13.880> to<00:01:14.030> you<00:01:14.119> a<00:01:14.150> year<00:01:14.420> and<00:01:14.540> a<00:01:14.570> half<00:01:14.600> two<00:01:14.900> years

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
that to you a year and a half two years

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.090 
that to you a year and a half two years
ago<00:01:15.320> I<00:01:16.060> mean<00:01:17.060> definitely<00:01:17.810> not<00:01:18.290> as<00:01:18.590> believable

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
ago I mean definitely not as believable

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.150 
ago I mean definitely not as believable
as<00:01:19.250> I<00:01:19.580> would<00:01:19.880> have<00:01:19.970> envisioned<00:01:20.600> it<00:01:21.130> but<00:01:22.130> I

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
as I would have envisioned it but I

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.010 
as I would have envisioned it but I
think<00:01:22.369> it's<00:01:22.640> just<00:01:22.670> a<00:01:22.820> testament<00:01:23.150> to<00:01:23.360> the

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
think it's just a testament to the

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.420 
think it's just a testament to the
Auburn<00:01:24.290> program<00:01:24.740> and<00:01:24.950> just<00:01:25.070> kind<00:01:25.220> of<00:01:25.250> what

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
Auburn program and just kind of what

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.950 
Auburn program and just kind of what
they<00:01:25.550> do<00:01:25.610> with<00:01:25.850> their<00:01:26.000> athletes<00:01:26.330> there<00:01:26.570> I<00:01:26.750> mean

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
they do with their athletes there I mean

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.210 
they do with their athletes there I mean
coming<00:01:27.800> in<00:01:28.009> I<00:01:28.160> mean<00:01:28.310> I<00:01:28.610> was<00:01:29.119> maybe<00:01:29.450> 25<00:01:29.990> 20<00:01:30.560> or<00:01:30.830> 25

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
coming in I mean I was maybe 25 20 or 25

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.060 
coming in I mean I was maybe 25 20 or 25
6<00:01:31.460> and<00:01:31.610> the<00:01:31.670> 15<00:01:32.090> I<00:01:32.330> somehow<00:01:33.110> managed<00:01:33.470> to<00:01:33.500> go<00:01:33.680> 22

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
6 and the 15 I somehow managed to go 22

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.389 
6 and the 15 I somehow managed to go 22
to<00:01:34.369> last<00:01:34.700> night<00:01:34.940> so<00:01:35.270> I<00:01:35.930> think<00:01:36.590> they<00:01:36.830> they

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
to last night so I think they they

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:39.730 
to last night so I think they they
develop<00:01:37.880> their<00:01:38.149> athletes<00:01:38.540> the<00:01:39.290> best<00:01:39.530> in<00:01:39.680> the

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
develop their athletes the best in the

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.020 
develop their athletes the best in the
country's<00:01:40.100> best<00:01:40.130> in<00:01:40.460> the<00:01:40.520> world<00:01:40.670> they're<00:01:41.030> so

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
country's best in the world they're so

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.950 
country's best in the world they're so
finally<00:01:44.030> starting<00:01:44.330> to<00:01:44.360> get<00:01:44.480> that<00:01:44.630> speed

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
finally starting to get that speed

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.690 
finally starting to get that speed
