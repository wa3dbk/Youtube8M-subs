00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:35.050 
get in primer you know what's and in

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:40.350 
get in primer you know what's and in
that<00:07:35.169> down<00:07:36.630> get<00:07:37.630> it<00:07:37.810> in<00:07:37.930> sealer<00:07:38.259> and<00:07:38.969> paint<00:07:39.969> and

that down get it in sealer and paint and

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.860 
that down get it in sealer and paint and
we'll<00:07:41.349> take<00:07:41.949> this<00:07:42.190> car<00:07:42.490> off<00:07:42.729> twice<00:07:43.180> by<00:07:43.599> that

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:43.870 
we'll take this car off twice by that

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.950 
we'll take this car off twice by that
time<00:07:44.169> so<00:07:44.789> it's<00:07:45.789> going<00:07:45.940> to<00:07:46.000> be<00:07:46.180> a<00:07:46.210> pretty

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:46.960 
time so it's going to be a pretty

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.740 
time so it's going to be a pretty
tedious<00:07:47.289> process
