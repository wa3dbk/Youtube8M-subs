 there he does to the country for the first time 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.380
 we have been here for so long, always waiting and waiting 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.999
 when I opened good news for the period 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:29.999

 schumacher larini and christian birth 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.660
 and also for the current year and a half 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.240
 I'm sad to make the world feel just behind Lily who is the second 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.180
 placed 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.180
 I'm sad, it has not stopped 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.280
 I took the change from Michael Schumacher Tuesday 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.280
 on Wednesday 30 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.000
 however hired 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.230
 he turned 24 with the team that enters the field in the confrontation 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.330
 jump uninterrupted 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.120
 Yesterday, Wednesday 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.290
 soon after 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.810
 behind Schumacher though on the track with pirelli tires thinking in front of the 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:36.500
 vehicle 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.140
 the format is the third one facing the fourth 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.200
 having Miguel Pinto catarino festrio triste that finally realized the 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.450
 first exchange 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.670
 port 23 per liter of air 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.810
 now falls to seventh place 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.220
 rounds in the press room by the sea that often 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.380
 track name 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.820
 revolted 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.820
 the relationship was appreciated in the 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.590
 to meet what we say that information to g7 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.120
 saying he hopes 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.330
 He was admitted 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.259
 the hospital 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.129
 But look at bologna 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.129
 I do not know if what we think the determination did not come 

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:15.739
 with injuries 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.669
 in the head 

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:19.219
 this party 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:20.509
 the position 

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:21.779
 an officer 

00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:24.779
 wall 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:29.480
 and surely he is the best hand at bc's competence 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:32.969
 the victim 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:35.969
 is the most important 

00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:43.629
 as much as 300 of the pilots who came after us 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:46.629
 without even speed 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:48.599
 I fell graco 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.599
 compatible 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.919
 thirty-five laps completed by schumacher 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:59.919
 I make your total of 59 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.079
 always with tomato larini sharing 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:08.499
 framingham katayama wall of berlin and christian fittipaldi 

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:10.899
 in seventh position 

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:14.529
 94 formula 1 a globe and the band brazil the club you 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:21.159
 formula 1 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:28.949
 cabral was in the face and what happens in the most critical period 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:33.409
 paulo brandão the brandão did the procedure counted with out passed 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:34.999
 of what he for eight 

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:36.779
 to go by the hour 

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:39.779
 this is the case of formula 1 with health 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.399
 so many things that you can not understand is always the same pilots 

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:48.769
 two more sea however it was pt 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:49.969
 for the producer 

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:52.969
 support raises doubts 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:57.919
 it's a minimal possibility 

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:00.919
 here's good 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.109
 closing the team is behind in the braking of the curve 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.129
 there you see nicola larini and defend the honor of the ferrari- 

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:14.369
 He is outside Rossi. 

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:16.569
 leading 

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:19.680
 fonttle biotonic 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.680
 This is it, but I asked. 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.180
 the country over 90 years of age varies from case to case 

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:32.840
 nicola larini peace trim shepherd ari car on the ground 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.430
 especially the drum and bags 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.650
 the turn of nicola larini 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.650
 he returns to roberto de toledo by car from a car on the track 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.710
 I'm leaving for the year 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.520
 companion 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.200
 was the purchase of coffee must come on account of the accident was another thing 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.259
 34 34 29 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:01.180
 the participation of companies 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.120
 after this fatal accident 'of a tent I want to have 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.129
 the accident was very clear 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:10.620
 the accident caused by a structural failure of the car 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.860
 everyone expected the hitech team 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.999
 participate in the race and even 

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:18.349
 the statement would be normal saying let's reject the corinthians 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:21.259
 we tried to take the car to make 

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:23.089
 we face the corinthians 

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:27.169
 absolutely insensitive and surprising 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:30.330
 So for what has come to be proven that now I abandon 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.360
 about the sector that has an information is a very new team 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.490
 and had no experience in contract building carbon 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.999
 uk 

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:41.319
 it's not a team 

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:42.930
 I got eight balls 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.120
