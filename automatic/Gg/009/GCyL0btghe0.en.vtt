00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.260
 and v8 citizens that's just a whole 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.260
 very own world 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.000
 say endlessly cool 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.239
 you can do 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:58.290
 mercedes slk 55 amg a power plant on 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.360
 Four wheels packed in a tailored suit 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.990
 of sheet metal, a source of joy 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:08.480
 five and a half liter big v8 downright 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.480
 beguiling the sound of his four fanfares 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.939
 the six-cylinder competition works 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:13.939
 in contrast, the boys choir 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.350
 dogs biting the bark do not say one 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.960
 the permanent smoke development at the rear 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.650
 the slk speaks a different language 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:30.549
 from the moral of the whole but we catch 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.549
 but just now 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.030
 we come to the data 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.300
 the top speed will be at 250 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.890
 km h electronically limited the sprint 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.890
 on 100 is after 49 seconds 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.840
 Past 360 horses care for one 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.500
 maximum torque of 510 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.870
 Newton meters 5439 cubic centimeters 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.820
 large combustion chamber stand well 1.5 tons 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.090
 empty weight no big 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.090
 Challenge 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.050
 for the aggregate not so for the 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.209
 drivers of the v8 is a lot of engine for 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.280
 so little car it's like you would 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.810
 a 60 inch plasma TV in one 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.290
 ten square meters of student dorm 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.290
 hanging 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:23.020
 it just went, I believe a lot 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.310
 important for this car that smokes and 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:29.800
 smoldering and china away 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.990
 total at the same time to relent again 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.050
 but then he immediately intervened in the 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.050
 electronics 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.500
 In everyday life, the electronics are on 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.660
 guardian angel on the track test one 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.510
 Challenge 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.530
 a bit critical when you come 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.360
 fixed I do not care 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.610
 the reflex against left and then comes 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.260
 the electronics stabilize the car you 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.060
 but have already steered in principle ground 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.530
 and then by and when the electronics 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.850
 you can do the intervention 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.870
 even though it is actually quite 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.920
 other direction wants to go 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.140
 this is something where you a bit 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.070
 if you really have to be careful then 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.070
 drives extremely 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.090
 Here is the race diplomat in demand 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.080
 mediator between the power of the engine 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.550
 and the strict rules of electronics 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.770
 You could also use electronics in the unimog 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.819
 because they are really very 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.780
 to intervene hard 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.780
 it lacks the sensitivity 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.920
 could make me a bit like that 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.069
 softer to be there, it is so so the 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.660
 hammer on electronics we need 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.670
 You do not need electronics anymore 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.290
 so this transition is so could that 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.239
 child harmonious could be more supple 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.780
 are now again attacks a tree and 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.780
 then free it 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.670
 Precise driving is the order of the day 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.390
 electronics you can not quite 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.390
 switch off 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.900
 just pushes forward on the 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.700
 brush and it is also that politics too 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.180
 the father does not have to grab anything anymore 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.040
 has wegboxen 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.830
 not just hingerotzt the price 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.860
 almost 70,000 euros will cost entry into 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.240
 the eight-cylinder pleasure at the slk 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:08.710
 advise and send the amg performance 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:10.780
 package for 5355 euro next to styling 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.250
 features are high tech behind the 18th 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.430
 counters ventilated against inside 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:18.310
 High-performance brakes of caliber 360 mm 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.470
 thanks to the retractable in 22 seconds 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.970
 variodach you can the sound orgy too 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.800
 listen inside unfiltered 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.080
 the interior is mercedes typical 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.490
 functionally designed the performance 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.950
 Steering wheel and the alu shift paddles 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:34.290
 are as much a part of the package as the carbon 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.290
 elements and amg sports leather seats 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:45.320
 black beauty looks good though 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.640
 daily like naomi campell 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.040
 if you like the electronics here 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.810
 For example, switch off c63 altogether 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:55.010
 could the things but times 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:59.120
 row by row in the forest review of the 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:03.860
 big brother c 63 amg creates with 1750 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:06.770
 kilo and 457 hp a 111 73 that is 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.930
 space four in our list of best 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.930
 direct opponent z4 m out of the house 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:14.990
 bmw 17 ps weaker but 90 kilos slim 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:18.040
 has its red time a 113 and 68 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.040
 currently eight 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:24.060
 motor a bit stronger at least 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.950
 it comes to me as a driver so 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.850
 but one of the driving dynamics had the 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:31.410
 has no chance against the bmw 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.840
 000 chance is not much but so 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.200
 quickly the slk 55 does not exist 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.200
 beaten 

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:03.710
 in the curves, it depends on the 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.349
 force to dose so that the electronics 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:11.259
 patrick not intervening projection on 

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:11.259
 the straight reached 122 82 km / h 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:16.870
 good 8 km h faster than the bmw 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:29.219
 two more turns and a chicane can 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.639
 black beauty his opponent paroli 

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:31.639
 Offer 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:45.880
 Patrick is right for the league 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:48.280
 the super sportsman has it as expected 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.800
 not enough with a strong 111 55 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.120
 he has his rivals z4 m roadster 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:55.270
 clearly beaten 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.780
 even big brother c63 will be in fifth place 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:59.130
 directed 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:59.130
 a surprising place four 

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.240
 however, the track test is in progress 

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:04.840
 also faster last year 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.030
 become 

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:09.070
 weather and edges claim to erase 

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.430
 the topmost bitumen movie literally 

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:11.770
 path 

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:14.760
 this increases the grip level and the 

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.760
 lap times fall 

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:25.139
 mercedes slk 55 amg i just say little 

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:27.030
 and mean z4 m roadster beaten c63 

00:07:25.139 --> 00:07:28.740
 beaten his bigger brother 

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:30.360
 surely he benefits from that 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:32.310
 tracktest asphalt a bit faster 

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.770
 has been over the winter but thanks 

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:36.180
 seven-speed automatic has short wheelbase 

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:37.740
 he also drove the time and therefore 

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:41.850
 probably not shut down the esp completely 

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:45.229
 was not bad the power dwarf has 

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:45.229
 used his chance
