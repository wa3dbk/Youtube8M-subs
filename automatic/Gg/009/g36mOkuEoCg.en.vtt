how do you really apply very very easy
first<00:02:53.980> of<00:02:54.190> all<00:02:54.310> we<00:02:54.489> wash<00:02:54.760> with<00:02:55.030> our<00:02:55.150> x1<00:02:55.570> washing

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
first of all we wash with our x1 washing

gloss that's part of the x1 family

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.280 
gloss that's part of the x1 family
secondly<00:02:59.650> we<00:03:00.100> use<00:03:00.280> step<00:03:00.640> 1<00:03:00.940> the<00:03:01.450> step<00:03:01.720> 1<00:03:01.900> cleats

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
secondly we use step 1 the step 1 cleats

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.210 
secondly we use step 1 the step 1 cleats
first<00:03:02.650> undiluted<00:03:03.340> keying<00:03:04.060> agent<00:03:04.390> on<00:03:04.480> your<00:03:04.810> car

first undiluted keying agent on your car
the<00:03:06.220> third<00:03:06.430> step<00:03:06.700> is<00:03:06.910> to<00:03:06.940> you<00:03:07.150> step<00:03:07.510> to<00:03:07.540> the

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
the third step is to you step to the

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.220 
the third step is to you step to the
step<00:03:08.680> 2<00:03:08.950> it<00:03:09.220> protects<00:03:09.880> it<00:03:10.299> built<00:03:10.540> polishes<00:03:11.049> and

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
step 2 it protects it built polishes and

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.620 
step 2 it protects it built polishes and
it<00:03:11.440> seals<00:03:11.799> it<00:03:12.100> effectively<00:03:12.820> cures<00:03:13.390> itself

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
it seals it effectively cures itself

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.319 
it seals it effectively cures itself
onto<00:03:14.140> step<00:03:14.530> 1<00:03:14.769> and<00:03:15.400> this<00:03:15.610> produces<00:03:16.180> an

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
onto step 1 and this produces an

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.350 
onto step 1 and this produces an
impenetrable<00:03:17.320> and<00:03:17.890> a<00:03:18.280> very<00:03:18.579> diamond<00:03:19.120> hard
