00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
animation layer a new animation there

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.600 
animation layer a new animation there
they<00:02:45.470> could<00:02:45.680> be<00:02:45.769> added<00:02:46.010> to<00:02:46.100> the<00:02:46.130> base<00:02:46.340> layer

they could be added to the base layer

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.190 
they could be added to the base layer
but<00:02:46.820> I<00:02:46.940> would<00:02:47.180> recommend<00:02:47.540> you<00:02:47.810> keep<00:02:47.989> the

but I would recommend you keep the

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.080 
but I would recommend you keep the

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
default of new animation layer so that

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.120 
default of new animation layer so that
that<00:02:50.390> won't<00:02:50.600> affect<00:02:50.810> any<00:02:51.260> other<00:02:51.530> animations

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
that won't affect any other animations

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.009 
that won't affect any other animations
you<00:02:52.250> might<00:02:52.430> have<00:02:52.549> added<00:02:52.700> to<00:02:52.910> the<00:02:53.030> scene<00:02:53.299> now

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
you might have added to the scene now

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:55.750 
you might have added to the scene now
I'll<00:02:54.230> increase<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:54.739> annunciation<00:02:55.549> here

to about 20 you can see Ryan just
starting<00:03:48.350> to<00:03:48.500> smile<00:03:48.830> there<00:03:49.130> so<00:03:49.280> you<00:03:49.370> can<00:03:49.520> add

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
starting to smile there so you can add

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.960 
starting to smile there so you can add
emotional<00:03:50.780> presets<00:03:51.710> kind<00:03:52.310> of<00:03:52.460> to<00:03:52.730> your

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
emotional presets kind of to your

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.060 
emotional presets kind of to your
characters<00:03:53.450> face<00:03:53.720> just<00:03:54.380> to<00:03:54.500> set<00:03:54.650> the<00:03:54.800> mood<00:03:54.830> at

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
characters face just to set the mood at

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.430 
characters face just to set the mood at
the<00:03:55.100> scene<00:03:55.400> perhaps<00:03:55.790> so<00:03:56.300> that's<00:03:56.630> essentially

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
the scene perhaps so that's essentially

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.950 
the scene perhaps so that's essentially
set<00:03:57.830> up<00:03:58.010> now<00:03:58.220> I'll<00:03:58.460> click<00:03:58.940> apply<00:03:59.420> and<00:03:59.690> that

00:03:59.950 --> 00:03:59.960 
set up now I'll click apply and that

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.520 
set up now I'll click apply and that
will<00:04:00.080> be<00:04:00.230> applied<00:04:00.530> to<00:04:00.770> the<00:04:01.220> Ryan<00:04:01.880> figure<00:04:02.270> and

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
will be applied to the Ryan figure and

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.070 
will be applied to the Ryan figure and
then<00:04:03.530> I'll<00:04:03.680> close<00:04:04.100> the<00:04:04.400> top<00:04:04.700> designer<00:04:05.120> so<00:04:05.900> with

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
then I'll close the top designer so with

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.480 
then I'll close the top designer so with
everything<00:04:06.380> in<00:04:06.500> place<00:04:06.530> we're<00:04:07.160> ready<00:04:07.400> to

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
everything in place we're ready to

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
everything in place we're ready to
animate<00:04:08.410> so<00:04:09.410> then<00:04:09.560> I'll<00:04:09.710> click<00:04:09.980> Play<00:04:10.490> and<00:04:10.700> this

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
animate so then I'll click Play and this

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.960 
animate so then I'll click Play and this
will<00:04:11.690> just<00:04:11.870> loop<00:04:12.140> through<00:04:12.440> all<00:04:12.650> you<00:04:13.610> have<00:04:13.790> to

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
will just loop through all you have to

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.440 
will just loop through all you have to
do<00:04:14.150> is<00:04:14.420> keep<00:04:15.110> talking<00:04:15.740> all<00:04:16.250> you<00:04:16.640> have<00:04:16.820> to<00:04:17.000> do<00:04:17.180> is

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
do is keep talking all you have to do is

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.020 
do is keep talking all you have to do is
keep<00:04:18.140> talking<00:04:18.739> and<00:04:18.980> as<00:04:19.160> you<00:04:19.280> can<00:04:19.430> see<00:04:19.459> Ryan's

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
keep talking and as you can see Ryan's

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.909 
keep talking and as you can see Ryan's
moves<00:04:20.209> its<00:04:20.419> head<00:04:20.570> into<00:04:20.870> a<00:04:20.900> slightly<00:04:21.500> strange

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
moves its head into a slightly strange

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.520 
moves its head into a slightly strange
position<00:04:22.460> then<00:04:22.669> so<00:04:23.450> i'll<00:04:23.570> come<00:04:23.780> back<00:04:23.930> to<00:04:23.990> frame

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
position then so i'll come back to frame

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.570 
position then so i'll come back to frame
one<00:04:24.860> and<00:04:25.570> i'll<00:04:26.570> adjust<00:04:26.750> the<00:04:27.020> camera<00:04:27.230> to

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
one and i'll adjust the camera to

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.940 
one and i'll adjust the camera to
compensate<00:04:28.580> then<00:04:29.200> meanwhile<00:04:30.200> it's<00:04:30.380> bringing

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
compensate then meanwhile it's bringing

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.530 
compensate then meanwhile it's bringing
it<00:04:31.130> back<00:04:31.280> up<00:04:31.520> and<00:04:31.970> i'll<00:04:32.090> leave<00:04:32.240> it<00:04:32.330> there<00:04:32.480> at

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
it back up and i'll leave it there at

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.300 
it back up and i'll leave it there at
frame<00:04:32.750> one<00:04:32.930> so<00:04:33.140> the<00:04:33.230> camera<00:04:33.530> should<00:04:33.770> remain<00:04:34.130> in

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
frame one so the camera should remain in

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.680 
frame one so the camera should remain in
place<00:04:34.430> so<00:04:34.640> then<00:04:34.790> I'll<00:04:34.910> start<00:04:35.180> again<00:04:35.360> that

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
place so then I'll start again that

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.090 
place so then I'll start again that
should<00:04:35.870> look<00:04:36.050> a<00:04:36.169> little<00:04:36.320> bit<00:04:36.590> better<00:04:36.800> and<00:04:36.980> you

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
should look a little bit better and you

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.340 
should look a little bit better and you
can<00:04:37.220> see<00:04:37.370> what's<00:04:37.580> happening<00:04:37.970> all<00:04:38.630> you<00:04:38.990> have<00:04:39.169> to
