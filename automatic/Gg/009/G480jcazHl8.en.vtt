00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:08.670
 good afternoon now i want to tell you 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.700
 how to perform replacement ritual replacement 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:16.680
 front brake pads 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:23.990
 on cars sprinter 2005 or 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.990
 lower or volkswagen lt 35 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:30.240
 before changing pads first 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.140
 need to buy new we do not remove the wheel 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.140
 Now we will deal with all this 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.129
 after removing the wheel 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.660
 exhibited caliper so that 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:44.079
 we were comfortable with it well, 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:47.949
 suppose here first 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:51.190
 we will remove this spring which 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:54.070
 fixes the pads in place it removes 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:01:00.159
 his here and here need deeds 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:04.089
 keep and she because nothing 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:05.850
 I understand, unscrew and here 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.850
 unscrewed 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.850
 hexagon 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:15.289
 so in order to unscrew 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:19.590
 do not take hex 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:21.569
 with a total diameter of 7 millimeters and 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.929
 unscrewed far spinning because 

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:30.539
 I tore them the same is their bottom 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:32.099
 Here is another which is also that 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:33.380
 the lid is also necessary to unscrew 

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:35.399
 this hexagon 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.359
 now when disconnecting the tiger is not 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.359
 show you what happens 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:47.460
 unscrews and here such things removed 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.310
 hexagons leave once so 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.520
 our next step when we shoot 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.299
 feel the principle without any problems is removed and 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.390
 puddle here so as not to spin 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.929
 pipeline shower and then removed 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.729
 simply 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:07.679
 box you wish to undermine try 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.550
 leave new 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:16.510
 we poured all the new pads 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:18.519
 here you need to give birth to this little bit 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.670
 there caliper cylinder because 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.470
 already used to thin not used to how 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:28.390
 you 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:31.930
 I insert here some you it 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:35.650
 so we put and then press that will deepen and 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.730
 cylinder if when you put set 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:47.470
 can now be fixed 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:49.410
 Caliper twirl their videos Well 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:55.470
 these things 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:58.390
 Hexagon and then became springs 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.990
 all this spring is back 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:05.680
 set after which you can put 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:08.560
 wheels back and she is ready for 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:12.190
 addicted to one thing while he started 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.420
 it's a few days abused aroma 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:18.640
 it is impossible because they should still 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:20.380
 get used to higher and drive everything if 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.640
