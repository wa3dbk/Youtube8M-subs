00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:05.380
 hello this video is responding to 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.260
 requests from organizers for men 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:11.519
 This is the first one that I am going to show you 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:13.709
 soon I will give you other ideas 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.439
 when selecting the paper, have very 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:19.140
 account the taste of the person I chose a 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:21.390
 wide box and other thinner box for 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.400
 place them as in a form of l 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.259
 you can do it either on the side that 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.329
 you like it does not necessarily have to be 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:29.329
 exactly as you are seeing it here 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:39.410
 cut out the covers of the boxes and I put 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.410
 the two boxes at the same level 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.370
 from the center of the widest box 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.380
 behind a diagonal line but leaving 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.080
 at the bottom a small height 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.250
 5 centimeters but this is optional 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.140
 you can cut 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.500
 you can draw the line down 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.400
 directly is a matter of design of the 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.449
 another side traces the same diagonal line 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.670
 then all this I'm going to cut 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.130
 this part of the front is going to be removed 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.550
 also and the other side is trimmed 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.550
 as well 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.250
 and as you will see this box is not for nothing 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.950
 strong will not resist or half a book 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.470
 so try a mold on a cardboard 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.560
 to stick it only from the side of 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.560
 outside 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.970
 here I decided join the two boxes before 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.040
 line the but if you are not very good 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.500
 lining up I suggest you better run 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.890
 each box separately and then the 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.890
 cribs 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.890
 and here I had to put another cardboard in 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:23.709
 the back to give more support 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.840
 to this project I also thought that 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.420
 the part in front of the box was 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.540
 a little high the truth if we put something 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.030
 there it was not going to be noticed so that the 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.680
 front side so this step 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.710
 You can also do it from the 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.750
 beginning 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.760
 this is the first organizer for 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.400
 men who performed I thought it would be 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.090
 easy but on the way I came across 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.470
 some surprises how are you but 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.690
 It worked well because I got other 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.530
 ideas that I will show you later on 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.530
 other videos 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.830
 I'm going to line it with two shades of color 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.989
 I'll use the darkest coffee to 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.640
 cover the bottom and the lightest I'm going to 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.640
 use to line the outside 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.950
 the paper that you to line the part 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.349
 outside has a design and two small ones 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.880
 that helped me a lot to be less notorious 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.640
 the ties 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.110
 as I told you at the beginning of the video 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:29.630
 take into account the taste of the person 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.630
 to which the paper will be selected 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.480
 leave a tab of approximately two 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:44.430
 centimeters and a half to be able to bend it 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.590
 then inwards this is a reference 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.260
 to the outside paper to fold it from this 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.800
 way and so in this way then tape 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.800
 the edges 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.430
 and so I went embracing each part up 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.099
 finish covering it but remember that 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.699
 You can line each box separately and then 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:27.699
 join them 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.150
 and now we pass next to the different 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.890
 cut out on a cardboard space 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.170
 square that you have left and is going to 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:56.820
 line first lining it and then you go 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.820
 to paste with rubber in this way 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:15.589
 remember bits of cardboard from a 

00:05:13.429 --> 00:05:18.639
 height of 5 centimeters and stick to us 

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:18.639
 around the edge 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:33.530
 and then the same procedure I put him 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:37.819
 rubber bar to the paper and then I went 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:39.949
 lining all the cardboard in the part of 

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:42.020
 in after I put the divisions 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:43.789
 according to how I believed that the 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.740
 person who will use this 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:48.050
 organizer because he would like more 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:51.530
 this organizer is not for me 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:54.080
 course and I did it was to the liking of the 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.699
 person who asked me so good 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.229
 that's why I tell them to take into account the 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:59.690
 the person's taste if he's a young guy 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:01.400
 of course you're going to like a 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:05.270
 organizer of an electric blue color 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:07.250
 maybe or a gray color I do not know but good 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:09.490
 take those details into account so that 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.780
 the organizer has the best 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:14.120
 possible and likes the people who 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:16.490
 you are going to give them thanks 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.259
 to watch the video and see you until the 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.210
 next week but he did not leave them without 

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:22.539
 before showing the photos that have 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.539
 shared 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:29.540
 greetings to emily rodrÃ­guez for me 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.720
 dear jacqueline friend who sent me 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:35.990
 this photo from your notebook 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:38.780
 also for erika who was inspired by a 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.640
 picture of a shadow box since she 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.800
 I did not have the box but this day was 

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:45.800
 excellent I loved thank you very much 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:48.200
 erika for the idea and also for Carlos 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.840
 fabra flowers that made its own version 

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:53.000
 from the desktop organizer to 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.770
 all of you thank you very much for watching 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.850
 this video and we'll see you until the 

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.850
 next chao
