00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
corn this way and just a thread of slide

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.820 
corn this way and just a thread of slide
right<00:03:37.590> through<00:03:37.620> here<00:03:38.420> then<00:03:39.420> the<00:03:40.230> thread<00:03:40.560> is

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
right through here then the thread is

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.230 
right through here then the thread is
going<00:03:41.010> to<00:03:41.130> go<00:03:41.600> through<00:03:43.310> this<00:03:44.310> little<00:03:44.610> squiggle

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
going to go through this little squiggle

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.750 
going to go through this little squiggle
and<00:03:45.500> the<00:03:46.500> thread<00:03:46.770> is<00:03:46.890> going<00:03:47.040> to<00:03:47.160> go<00:03:47.280> through

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
and the thread is going to go through

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.490 
and the thread is going to go through
here<00:03:48.030> I'm<00:03:48.210> sticking<00:03:48.570> my<00:03:48.600> finger<00:03:48.990> in<00:03:49.020> there<00:03:49.200> and

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
then next you're going to put the thread

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.140 
then next you're going to put the thread
through<00:03:51.950> the<00:03:52.950> needle<00:03:53.190> and<00:03:53.430> put<00:03:53.820> a<00:03:53.850> thread

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
through the needle and put a thread

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.430 
through the needle and put a thread
through<00:03:54.360> the<00:03:54.450> needle<00:03:54.600> hold<00:03:55.260> that<00:03:56.750> chain

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
through the needle hold that chain

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.420 
through the needle hold that chain
and<00:04:00.440> so<00:04:00.620> you're<00:04:00.769> gonna<00:04:00.890> put<00:04:01.069> the<00:04:01.159> thread

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
and so you're gonna put the thread

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:10.930 
and so you're gonna put the thread
through<00:04:01.640> the<00:04:01.790> needle<00:04:06.879> fun<00:04:07.879> today<00:04:08.659> I<00:04:09.549> got<00:04:10.549> there

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
through the needle fun today I got there

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.839 
through the needle fun today I got there
and<00:04:11.530> that's<00:04:12.530> how<00:04:12.650> you<00:04:12.709> thread<00:04:13.069> this<00:04:13.190> beautiful
