in<00:02:00.239> here<00:02:00.569> and<00:02:00.780> we<00:02:01.530> did<00:02:01.679> a<00:02:01.709> couple<00:02:01.950> test<00:02:02.489> pans

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
in here and we did a couple test pans

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.869 
in here and we did a couple test pans
earlier<00:02:03.330> and<00:02:04.009> found<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.069> couple<00:02:05.250> chunky<00:02:05.700> pieces

earlier and found a couple chunky pieces
of<00:02:06.149> gold<00:02:06.300> not<00:02:07.259> very<00:02:07.470> big<00:02:09.349> probably<00:02:10.349> about<00:02:10.440> the

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
of gold not very big probably about the

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.220 
of gold not very big probably about the
size<00:02:10.770> of<00:02:10.950> birdshot<00:02:11.330> but<00:02:12.830> that's<00:02:13.830> a<00:02:13.980> start<00:02:14.280> so

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
size of birdshot but that's a start so

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.750 
size of birdshot but that's a start so
stay<00:02:16.230> tuned<00:02:16.530> we'll<00:02:17.099> be<00:02:17.250> back<00:02:17.459> with<00:02:17.730> some

stay tuned we'll be back with some

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.959 
stay tuned we'll be back with some
