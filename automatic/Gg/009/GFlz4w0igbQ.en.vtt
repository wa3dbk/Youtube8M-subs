00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:55.830 
go to driver details and then you
install<00:05:52.180> your<00:05:52.979> lib<00:05:53.979> drivers<00:05:54.569> so<00:05:55.569> you<00:05:55.629> would<00:05:55.810> go

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
install your lib drivers so you would go

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.219 
install your lib drivers so you would go
update<00:05:56.169> driver<00:05:56.770> and<00:05:57.189> then<00:05:57.879> you<00:05:58.000> say<00:05:58.150> browse<00:05:58.479> to

00:05:59.219 --> 00:05:59.229 
update driver and then you say browse to

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:02.129 
update driver and then you say browse to
your<00:05:59.259> computer<00:05:59.800> and<00:06:00.009> then<00:06:00.759> you<00:06:00.909> browse<00:06:01.240> and<00:06:01.659> my

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:02.139 
your computer and then you browse and my

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:05.040 
your computer and then you browse and my
remote<00:06:02.860> choice<00:06:03.159> right<00:06:03.400> here<00:06:03.610> lib<00:06:03.879> and<00:06:04.120> I<00:06:04.840> use

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.050 
remote choice right here lib and I use

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.040 
remote choice right here lib and I use
the<00:06:05.289> driver<00:06:05.699> 64<00:06:06.699> which<00:06:07.360> is<00:06:07.539> in<00:06:07.659> that<00:06:07.810> Lib

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050 
the driver 64 which is in that Lib

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.779 
the driver 64 which is in that Lib
folder<00:06:08.319> after<00:06:08.740> you<00:06:09.009> up<00:06:10.800> unrar<00:06:11.800> it<00:06:12.009> and<00:06:12.189> it

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:12.789 
folder after you up unrar it and it

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:16.080 
folder after you up unrar it and it
works<00:06:13.569> so<00:06:13.810> I<00:06:14.139> was<00:06:14.529> pleasantly<00:06:15.520> surprised

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.090 
works so I was pleasantly surprised

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:18.450 
works so I was pleasantly surprised
because<00:06:16.270> that's<00:06:16.509> an<00:06:16.629> XP<00:06:17.110> driver<00:06:17.469> and<00:06:17.830> it

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
because that's an XP driver and it

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:24.149 
because that's an XP driver and it
worked<00:06:18.870> so<00:06:19.870> once<00:06:20.469> it<00:06:21.279> finds<00:06:21.699> it<00:06:22.060> then<00:06:23.069> all<00:06:24.069> you

00:06:24.149 --> 00:06:24.159 
worked so once it finds it then all you

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:28.260 
worked so once it finds it then all you
do<00:06:24.580> is<00:06:24.849> you<00:06:25.449> go<00:06:25.599> on<00:06:26.310> your<00:06:27.310> remote<00:06:27.639> joy<00:06:27.940> light

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.270 
do is you go on your remote joy light

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:32.040 
do is you go on your remote joy light
folder<00:06:29.020> again<00:06:29.589> you<00:06:30.129> click<00:06:30.610> remote<00:06:31.000> joy<00:06:31.479> light

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.050 
folder again you click remote joy light

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:36.420 
folder again you click remote joy light
e<00:06:32.440> n<00:06:33.360> double<00:06:34.360> click<00:06:34.629> it<00:06:34.839> and<00:06:34.960> then<00:06:35.860> there<00:06:36.159> it<00:06:36.279> is

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.430 
e n double click it and then there it is

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:41.610 
e n double click it and then there it is
and<00:06:36.909> it<00:06:37.089> works<00:06:38.909> and<00:06:39.960> then<00:06:40.960> you<00:06:41.169> are<00:06:41.319> playing

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:41.620 
and it works and then you are playing

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.499 
and it works and then you are playing
your<00:06:42.250> PSP<00:06:42.690> on<00:06:43.690> your<00:06:43.960> computer<00:06:44.409> screen<00:06:45.000> and<00:06:46.000> it

00:06:46.499 --> 00:06:46.509 
your PSP on your computer screen and it

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:50.159 
your PSP on your computer screen and it
makes<00:06:46.719> it<00:06:46.990> a<00:06:47.169> lot<00:06:47.830> easier<00:06:47.889> to<00:06:48.310> play<00:06:49.020> things<00:06:50.020> you

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:50.169 
makes it a lot easier to play things you

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:51.929 
makes it a lot easier to play things you
can<00:06:50.379> do<00:06:50.560> is<00:06:50.770> if<00:06:50.800> you<00:06:51.039> hit<00:06:51.219> escape<00:06:51.550> on<00:06:51.909> your

00:06:51.929 --> 00:06:51.939 
can do is if you hit escape on your

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:54.499 
can do is if you hit escape on your
keyboard<00:06:52.139> you<00:06:53.139> can<00:06:53.199> actually<00:06:53.529> set<00:06:54.069> up<00:06:54.099> a

00:06:54.499 --> 00:06:54.509 
keyboard you can actually set up a

00:06:54.509 --> 00:06:58.379 
keyboard you can actually set up a
controller<00:06:55.509> I<00:06:56.039> haven't<00:06:57.039> done<00:06:57.279> it<00:06:57.490> but<00:06:57.909> you<00:06:58.180> can

00:06:58.379 --> 00:06:58.389 
controller I haven't done it but you can

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:02.730 
controller I haven't done it but you can
use<00:06:58.689> it<00:06:58.719> i<00:06:58.900> know<00:06:59.199> the<00:06:59.409> PSP<00:07:00.629> our<00:07:01.629> ps3<00:07:02.080> controller
