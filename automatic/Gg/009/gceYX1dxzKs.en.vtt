the<00:06:22.229> full<00:06:22.440> match<00:06:22.620> it<00:06:22.919> was<00:06:23.039> I<00:06:23.220> think<00:06:23.460> like<00:06:23.610> four

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
the full match it was I think like four

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.370 
the full match it was I think like four
or<00:06:24.240> five<00:06:24.300> minutes<00:06:24.750> got<00:06:24.870> cut<00:06:25.020> out<00:06:25.050> of<00:06:25.140> the<00:06:25.229> match

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.380 
or five minutes got cut out of the match

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.290 
or five minutes got cut out of the match
it<00:06:26.099> was<00:06:26.280> like<00:06:26.400> I<00:06:26.520> think<00:06:26.669> the<00:06:26.729> matter<00:06:26.880> is<00:06:26.970> 15

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 
it was like I think the matter is 15

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.820 
it was like I think the matter is 15
minutes<00:06:27.570> and<00:06:27.719> the<00:06:27.779> DVD<00:06:28.050> version<00:06:28.080> is<00:06:28.409> only<00:06:28.529> ten

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830 
minutes and the DVD version is only ten

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.620 
minutes and the DVD version is only ten
so<00:06:29.130> I<00:06:29.340> don't<00:06:29.940> know<00:06:30.000> why<00:06:30.120> they<00:06:30.210> don't<00:06:30.390> put<00:06:30.539> the

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:30.630 
so I don't know why they don't put the

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:31.760 
so I don't know why they don't put the
whole<00:06:30.719> match<00:06:30.930> on<00:06:31.169> there<00:06:31.349> I<00:06:31.380> think<00:06:31.650> it's

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:31.770 
whole match on there I think it's

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:33.050 
whole match on there I think it's
because<00:06:31.950> time<00:06:32.190> constraints<00:06:32.640> in<00:06:32.700> the<00:06:32.789> DVD

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 
because time constraints in the DVD

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.269 
because time constraints in the DVD
considering<00:06:33.570> they've<00:06:33.740> they<00:06:34.740> put<00:06:34.919> the<00:06:34.979> DVDs

00:06:35.269 --> 00:06:35.279 
considering they've they put the DVDs

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:36.439 
considering they've they put the DVDs
out<00:06:35.370> HD<00:06:35.880> if<00:06:35.940> you<00:06:36.120> have<00:06:36.210> a

out HD and the disc can only go about
three<00:06:40.770> hours<00:06:40.949> I<00:06:41.189> think<00:06:41.629> so<00:06:42.629> that's<00:06:42.779> why<00:06:42.930> you

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:42.990 
three hours I think so that's why you

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.409 
three hours I think so that's why you
don't<00:06:43.199> get<00:06:43.349> a<00:06:43.789> like<00:06:44.789> you<00:06:45.059> know<00:06:45.089> a<00:06:45.180> lot<00:06:45.330> of

don't get a like you know a lot of
