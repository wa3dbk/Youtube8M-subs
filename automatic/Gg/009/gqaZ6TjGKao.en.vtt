 official website of the project 3w. in avoid 

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.790
 dot com 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.630
 you are not before playing the law with you 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.870
 ring is prescribed to him every round 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.300
 starts from 1 to 20 under each player 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.820
 of you i have always considered it not my 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:44.020
 next to whom we train shooting under 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.610
 right tactics as we sit season 2 all 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.110
 so as not to produce counter-strike as 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:52.059
 as if I didnâ€™t know where he was going from Tibetan 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:53.710
 cut down and you can do everything 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.300
 hello today's lesson will be different 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.010
 from previous today we talk about 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.989
 flash games that helps a lot 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.730
 players to respond as quickly as possible 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.500
 on the appearance of an opponent in a certain 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.780
 place and how to quickly be guided to 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.760
 the goal of course is to make great headshots 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.920
 let's start with installing programs that 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.960
 help us raise our level of interference 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.330
 There are many sites on the Internet that 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.830
 designed to train the reaction but 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.659
 we offer only two games that 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.400
 slightly different from each other but 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.040
 this balances one another 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.479
 let's start with a game called go below 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.590
 under the video there is a link to download 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.080
 of this program 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.120
 everything is very simple after downloaded 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.550
 you unpack the archive current folder and 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.530
 only one label appears which you 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.210
 launch and start the game 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.250
 if someone has trouble 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.290
 start the game delete it and along with it 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.850
 strike himself at this level 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.580
 ended and go to the very 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.560
 description of this game, everything looks very 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.390
 just a small window with which the first 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.370
 what we see is a lot of ovals with 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.740
 which our targets will appear on 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.450
 and which will need to get round 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.400
 Lasts only 30 seconds for which you 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.230
 must hit targets as much as possible 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.690
 failures do not take away from you 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.700
 a point hit gives you plus two points 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.960
 even in this game of two options 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.300
 getting into bill gates 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.850
 1 this system with which you fall 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.280
 in everything and not highlighting each 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.230
 target and 2 is of course the choice of each 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.360
 target and try to be as clear as possible 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.730
 knock each one out of it of course 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.440
 better and better records set 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.060
 can and between each other and share 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.190
 by their achievements thus 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.370
 motivate distance 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.370
 the game 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.980
 Another flash game is probably a reflex 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.170
 the most popular game of all 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.300
 outside you are required to knock out as much as possible 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.190
 balls but not enough to drink as 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.080
 it is possible more so still they need to try 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.740
 knock out until they will 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.720
 increase 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.090
 it will give you a plus to your gaming 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.550
 the result is taken away from you 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.260
 a thousand points with each round of speed 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.660
 balls increases and knock them out 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.580
 it gets harder and harder for me 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.380
 the record number of points was five hundred 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.780
 twenty four thousand after i 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.060
 I saw how they akhundov he is a coachman 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.740
 stuffed 606 thousand well and after on 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.500
 Ukrainian final double u si ji 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.420
 an old man before the game filled 707 thousand 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.180
 the question of whether to play 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.980
 It suggests itself of course it costs because 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.750
 top players show us visual 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:37.090
 an example that before the games in addition to demos 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.090
 worth playing a couple of games for flash games 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.830
 now let's go to the cards which 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.260
 help us raise our level of shooting 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.150
 accept cards from the esko cdi team 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.920
 There are cards from the composition of steam 3d 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.960
 some have seen have not played these 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.940
 Well, some cards are not convenient. 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.560
 so that they can work on them 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.990
 vodka as positional and in motion 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.130
 the list of cards is incomplete so if you 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.440
 you have to understand and where to get 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.690
 the rest will be very grateful to you and 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.760
 Immediately attach them to the news card 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.780
 cropped on dust2 card can be played 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.970
 only on apple and 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.230
 over Raynie can be played both on the pent and on the b 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.269
 not only on 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.220
 and yet on these maps is very 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.990
 convenient to play 2 on 2 and blood and ready 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.150
 Plenty to play on hold and try to 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.980
 to train some kind of pairing in 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.640
 Generally for every taste on it all around 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.640
 successful training
