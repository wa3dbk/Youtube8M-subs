00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:15.039
 today we are going to make a pionono of nutella 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:20.340
 the ingredients that we are going to need 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:24.599
 they are sugar icing flour sugar egg 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.599
 essence of vanilla and nutella 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.950
 The first thing we have done has been to take 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.940
 the eggs and the sugar with our 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.950
 We will move it yellow 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.260
 approximately 67 minutes until 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.879
 it is all integrated 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.309
 once we have it all right 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:47.350
 mixed let's catch and let's take 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.350
 the flour and we will go sifting 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.990
 once we've thrown all our lives 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.710
 in sifting we are going to mix 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.020
 carefully with movements 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.790
 envelopes now is the time that 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.540
 let's put the oven preheated to 180 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.540
 degrees 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.360
 now let's take the essence or 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.360
 vanilla extract 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.920
 let's mix well 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.250
 Y 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.890
 and now let's take a baking paper 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:18.259
 we're going to take some flour for 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.810
 that at the time of rolling it we are more 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.439
 easy and do not leave us with moisture 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.439
 stuck 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:30.820
 and we are going to throw all the dough 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.820
 all over the mold 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.979
 we have taken it out of the oven we have put 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.440
 a clean cloth and now very carefully 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.659
 we have turned around and let's go 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.659
 carefully removing the paper 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.020
 once we have it turns it around 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:54.440
 we have taken a breath or we have not put 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.620
 over and we're going to roll it up so that 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.720
 the time to fill in what 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:02.030
 it will not be easier 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.760
 we have it well rolled up we're going to 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.140
 cover with the cloth and we will leave it 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.720
 about 5 minutes 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.880
 once we have caught and it has 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.490
 chilled a little we have put the nutella 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.990
 and we will extend the tree we will 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.250
 to spread all over the cake until 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.620
 get to the edges 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.930
 once we have it all filled with 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.930
 very careful we are going to go rolling what 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.330
 once we have filled it in, 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.910
 we have closed and we have thrown out 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.910
