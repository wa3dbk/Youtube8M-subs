00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 most fruit crops with 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.120
 our black and red currants of course 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.980
 the same cropping is required and this is one of 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.559
 most important activities for getting 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.009
 quality crop and for getting rid of 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.450
 pest diseases 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.340
 just cut the kid black 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.220
 currants and note that here 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.010
 discovered here she is a little black 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.220
 the hole in the middle of the escape itself is 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.580
 the course of such an insect as a glass 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.460
 called that is the pest here 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.340
 space here this hole apparently from 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.100
 her and went eat all the escape to the very 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.960
 grounds I give my hand to cut off that in 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.760
 last year harvest on this thread 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.300
 which I cut was very scanty 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.660
 more precisely were small berries if you 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.879
 suddenly on some branches crushed 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.039
 berries must cut quite 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.260
 maybe there is glass and it is necessary 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.879
 this escape cut exactly until then 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:03.149
 until there is healthy wood 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:05.790
 since the caterpillar itself is quite possible 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.380
 growing in escape two years is quite possible 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.290
 that it is somewhere here still inside 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.340
 winter if we cut off here and throw out 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.290
 this and sagem 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.000
 she will die and will not give in the future 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.490
 their offspring therefore we are a little bit 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.130
 keep this pest two powerful 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.100
 powerful babes are located above each other 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.159
 as a result, the sun only receives 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.350
 top bottom absolutely does not work 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.799
 Moreover, there is a very , very 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.470
 very very very many foliage in 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.450
 result after rain for example especially 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.320
 if the sun only looks after 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.000
 rain khc on thursday there will be a steam room 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.890
 in the end if there are any 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.320
 causative agents of fungal diseases they 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.450
 there is it all will fall into favorable 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.509
 environment and wildly grow as a result 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.759
 here is a fungal disease for you 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.880
 still carry out pruning and which 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:01.100
 there are rules in annual increments 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:03.689
 they are visible on the cortex it is lighter 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.280
 need to pay attention to its length 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.550
 annual growth 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.330
 if its length is less than 15 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.560
 centimeters 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.510
 this escape should be removed 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:18.040
 also blackcurrant shoots over 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.230
 the age of four should also 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.450
 mercilessly remove thin shoots 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.000
 it is necessary to do this directly 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:29.500
 the very base of the bush as possible there 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.200
 deeper kicks we try not to leave 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.349
 if we remove the shoots of the base itself 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.940
 as a result, it stimulates 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:40.180
 the awakening of the kidneys renewal that is 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.250
 shoots that will go from the root 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.670
 the next harvest will be borne 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.850
 so any pruning is stimulation 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.280
 growth and plants recovering 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.200
 will you provide skeletal branches 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:58.090
 i.e. future harvest support of the future 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:01.420
 harvest for the next years I escape 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.870
 cut further with this hole and on this 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.750
 there is no hole on the side therefore 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.280
 somewhere here inside this here 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.010
 caterpillar and which is a move to do 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.739
 therefore, this escape is needed here 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.130
 be sure to destroy burn if you already 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:20.829
 did not have time to do it in the fall or 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:24.190
 Spring although black currants better 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:27.359
 nevertheless in the autumn to cut as it is visible 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:30.310
 where how many fruits have been how many 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.750
 fruit this branch is therefore better 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.319
 put on autumn carry similar 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.569
 events but if not well then at least 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.420
 would now then if the bush as in this 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:43.660
 The case is completely store already and it lies 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.299
 in fact, you can completely cut off all 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.660
 shoots end up you of course 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:53.489
 lose your harvest for this year but after 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:56.260
 in the same year, new shoots will grow and 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.650
 in a year it turns out they will give a new 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.519
 the harvest 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:03.989
 also when a new one-year escape 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:07.180
 there are good recommendations 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.100
 prune annual increment of about two 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.259
 kidney 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.259
