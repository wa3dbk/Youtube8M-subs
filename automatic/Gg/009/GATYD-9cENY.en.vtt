00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.550 

huh<00:01:57.930> interesting

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.580 

so<00:02:04.159> I<00:02:04.189> can<00:02:04.310> play<00:02:04.430> rock<00:02:04.729> and<00:02:04.759> put<00:02:05.149> the<00:02:05.470> armor<00:02:06.470> on

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.040 
so I can play rock and put the armor on
it<00:02:06.740> I<00:02:07.209> was<00:02:08.209> going<00:02:08.300> to<00:02:08.360> what<00:02:08.660> I'm<00:02:08.750> going<00:02:08.869> to<00:02:08.899> do

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
is attack with social in spirit I think

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.430

that's the best play right deck with

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.610 
that's the best play right deck with
spirit<00:02:12.910> play<00:02:13.910> the<00:02:14.030> rock<00:02:14.180> downsize<00:02:14.930> a<00:02:14.959> token

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:32.320 
light for that but something along those
lines

turn for debts bridge Goliath is not fun

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.290 
turn for debts bridge Goliath is not fun
to<00:02:35.510> play<00:02:35.780> against<00:02:36.170> it<00:02:36.830> is<00:02:37.130> a<00:02:37.160> beating<00:02:37.880> as<00:02:38.060> they

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
to play against it is a beating as they

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.700 
to play against it is a beating as they
say<00:02:40.210> centaurs<00:02:41.210> Accord<00:02:41.540> time<00:02:41.990> or<00:02:42.290> coursers

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
say centaurs Accord time or coursers

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:48.010 
say centaurs Accord time or coursers
Accord<00:02:42.980> Knightly<00:02:43.520> valor<00:02:43.640> well<00:02:44.060> that<00:02:44.210> sucks<00:02:47.020> so

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
Accord Knightly valor well that sucks so

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:56.200 
Accord Knightly valor well that sucks so
let's<00:02:48.290> see<00:02:48.500> oh<00:02:48.890> jeez<00:02:53.140> down<00:02:54.140> so<00:02:54.500> is<00:02:54.800> you<00:02:55.310> double

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
let's see oh jeez down so is you double

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:13.250 
let's see oh jeez down so is you double
block<00:02:56.420> take<00:02:56.780> 9<00:02:57.200> and<00:02:57.440> go<00:02:57.500> for

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.800 

so<00:03:13.890> I<00:03:13.920> think<00:03:14.040> so<00:03:14.459> what<00:03:14.580> I<00:03:14.610> do<00:03:14.730> is<00:03:14.849> I<00:03:15.120> bounce<00:03:16.489> the

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
so I think so what I do is I bounce the

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:25.610 
so I think so what I do is I bounce the
general<00:03:21.170> attack<00:03:22.170> with<00:03:22.470> these<00:03:22.769> guys<00:03:23.129> I<00:03:24.620> might

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
general attack with these guys I might

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.160 
general attack with these guys I might
so<00:03:26.489> this<00:03:26.640> is<00:03:26.670> seven<00:03:27.180> so<00:03:27.599> this<00:03:27.720> doesn't<00:03:27.900> put<00:03:28.079> him

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
so this is seven so this doesn't put him

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.550 
so this is seven so this doesn't put him
on<00:03:28.290> a<00:03:28.319> bigger<00:03:28.560> clock<00:03:28.950> I<00:03:30.170> might<00:03:31.170> need<00:03:31.319> to<00:03:31.409> keep

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
on a bigger clock I might need to keep

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.020 
on a bigger clock I might need to keep
this<00:03:31.650> back<00:03:31.860> to<00:03:31.980> chump<00:03:32.250> block<00:03:32.430> with<00:03:32.610> if<00:03:32.790> he<00:03:32.879> is<00:03:33.000> a

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
this back to chump block with if he is a

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.690 
this back to chump block with if he is a
rest<00:03:33.680> but<00:03:34.680> then<00:03:34.799> I<00:03:34.829> guess<00:03:34.980> he<00:03:35.099> would<00:03:35.430> have<00:03:35.579> to

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
rest but then I guess he would have to

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.229 
rest but then I guess he would have to
have<00:03:36.000> a<00:03:36.030> rest<00:03:36.269> and<00:03:36.510> another<00:03:36.870> pump<00:03:37.110> spell<00:03:38.239> what

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
have a rest and another pump spell what

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.030 
have a rest and another pump spell what
I'm<00:03:39.329> just<00:03:39.480> going<00:03:39.599> to<00:03:39.629> do<00:03:39.780> is<00:03:39.900> play<00:03:40.109> Pegasus<00:03:40.920> and

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
I'm just going to do is play Pegasus and

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
I'm just going to do is play Pegasus and

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:06.219
