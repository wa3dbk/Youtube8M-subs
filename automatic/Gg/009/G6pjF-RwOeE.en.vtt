do you know the spaces of vacuum I just
learned<00:02:18.349> that<00:02:18.500> I<00:02:18.650> shouldn't<00:02:19.040> even<00:02:19.190> be<00:02:19.340> able<00:02:19.400> to

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
learned that I shouldn't even be able to

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.270 
learned that I shouldn't even be able to
survive<00:02:19.940> up<00:02:20.209> here<00:02:20.240> it's<00:02:20.990> insane<00:02:21.500> yes<00:02:22.069> the

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
survive up here it's insane yes the

survive up here it's insane yes the
technology<00:02:22.940> is<00:02:23.150> quiet<00:02:23.660> if<00:02:23.750> I<00:02:23.870> screamed<00:02:24.290> right

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
technology is quiet if I screamed right

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.740 
technology is quiet if I screamed right
now<00:02:24.740> don't<00:02:25.220> scream<00:02:25.580> but<00:02:25.910> if<00:02:26.000> I<00:02:26.120> did<00:02:26.330> nobody

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
now don't scream but if I did nobody

asteroids at the local arcade if
somebody<00:03:27.140> had<00:03:27.260> told<00:03:27.440> me<00:03:27.590> that<00:03:27.680> someday<00:03:28.100> I

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
somebody had told me that someday I

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.610 
somebody had told me that someday I
would<00:03:28.370> be<00:03:28.610> doing<00:03:28.730> it<00:03:29.000> for<00:03:29.210> real<00:03:29.530> well<00:03:30.530> I

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
would be doing it for real well I

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.780 
would be doing it for real well I
probably<00:03:30.860> wouldn't<00:03:31.130> have<00:03:31.220> given<00:03:31.340> it<00:03:31.550> a<00:03:31.610> lot<00:03:31.640> of

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
probably wouldn't have given it a lot of

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.430 
probably wouldn't have given it a lot of
thought<00:03:32.150> because<00:03:32.330> nothing<00:03:32.750> much<00:03:32.900> ever<00:03:33.050> phased

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
thought because nothing much ever phased

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.200 
thought because nothing much ever phased
me<00:03:34.180> on<00:03:35.180> the<00:03:35.390> next<00:03:35.600> baseball<00:03:36.260> a<00:03:36.380> adventure

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.210 
me on the next baseball a adventure

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.820 
me on the next baseball a adventure
thinking<00:03:38.210> of<00:03:38.300> starting<00:03:38.690> a<00:03:38.900> restaurant<00:03:39.110> on<00:03:39.740> the

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
thinking of starting a restaurant on the

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.120 
thinking of starting a restaurant on the
moon<00:03:40.300> what<00:03:41.300> do<00:03:41.360> you<00:03:41.420> think<00:03:41.510> of<00:03:41.690> that<00:03:42.040> well<00:03:43.040> that

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
moon what do you think of that well that

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.940 
moon what do you think of that well that
sounds<00:03:43.460> like<00:03:43.580> a<00:03:43.610> poor<00:03:43.940> business<00:03:44.420> decision

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
sounds like a poor business decision

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.130 
sounds like a poor business decision
yeah<00:03:45.950> maybe<00:03:46.220> there<00:03:47.210> might<00:03:47.240> not<00:03:47.420> be<00:03:47.600> enough

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
yeah maybe there might not be enough

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:54.130 
yeah maybe there might not be enough
atmosphere<00:03:52.300> you<00:03:53.300> know<00:03:53.330> because<00:03:53.780> people

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
atmosphere you know because people

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.720 
atmosphere you know because people
wouldn't<00:03:54.290> be<00:03:54.440> able<00:03:54.530> to<00:03:54.650> breathe<00:03:54.710> and<00:03:55.250> stuff

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
wouldn't be able to breathe and stuff

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.810 
wouldn't be able to breathe and stuff
yeah<00:03:55.940> it's<00:03:56.120> probably<00:03:56.330> not<00:03:56.600> a<00:03:56.630> good<00:03:56.750> idea
