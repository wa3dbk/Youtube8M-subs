illusion I can explain that this has to

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.320 
illusion I can explain that this has to
be<00:02:10.650> the<00:02:11.160> crescendo<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.850> this<00:02:11.970> has<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.240> be

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
be the crescendo and this has to be

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.910 
be the crescendo and this has to be
because<00:02:12.480> of<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.900> harmonium<00:02:13.410> because<00:02:13.650> of<00:02:13.800> the

because of the harmonium because of the
rhythm

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
rhythm

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.160 
rhythm
for<00:02:14.670> thousands<00:02:15.150> of<00:02:15.239> reasons<00:02:15.660> I<00:02:15.750> could<00:02:15.930> really

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
for thousands of reasons I could really

for thousands of reasons I could really
explain<00:02:16.770> Russia<00:02:17.130> but<00:02:17.819> I<00:02:18.000> cannot<00:02:18.840> teach<00:02:19.200> here

explain Russia but I cannot teach here
to<00:02:20.040> him<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.910> level<00:02:21.420> of<00:02:21.650> intensity<00:02:22.650> of<00:02:22.980> his

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
to him the level of intensity of his

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.120 
to him the level of intensity of his
relationship<00:02:24.120> with<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.360> music<00:02:24.690> how<00:02:25.260> much<00:02:25.770> he

relationship with the music how much he

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.420 
relationship with the music how much he
will<00:02:26.340> want<00:02:26.610> -<00:02:26.910> will<00:02:27.690> he<00:02:27.930> be<00:02:27.959> able<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.739> forget<00:02:29.190> at

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
will want - will he be able to forget at

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.949 
will want - will he be able to forget at
the<00:02:29.459> moment<00:02:29.880> of<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.060> prick<00:02:30.360> of<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.720> crescendo

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
the moment of the prick of the crescendo

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.199 
the moment of the prick of the crescendo
that<00:02:31.709> he<00:02:31.830> had<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:31.980> fight<00:02:32.310> with<00:02:32.489> his<00:02:32.640> girlfriend

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
that he had a fight with his girlfriend

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.059 
that he had a fight with his girlfriend
or<00:02:33.360> that<00:02:33.630> his<00:02:33.780> mother<00:02:34.080> didn't<00:02:34.650> bring<00:02:34.800> in<00:02:34.950> the

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
or that his mother didn't bring in the

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.050 
or that his mother didn't bring in the
groceries<00:02:35.250> or<00:02:35.670> will<00:02:36.120> he<00:02:36.269> be<00:02:36.420> able<00:02:36.599> to<00:02:37.010> make

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
groceries or will he be able to make

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.759 
groceries or will he be able to make
complete<00:02:39.060> forget<00:02:39.900> all<00:02:40.080> of<00:02:40.110> that<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.650> have<00:02:41.220> a

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
complete forget all of that and have a

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.830 
complete forget all of that and have a
absolutely<00:02:43.849> burning<00:02:44.849> intensity<00:02:45.569> for<00:02:45.750> the

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
absolutely burning intensity for the

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.979 
absolutely burning intensity for the
crescendo<00:02:46.610> this<00:02:47.610> you<00:02:47.850> cannot<00:02:48.090> teach<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:48.750> this

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
crescendo this you cannot teach and this

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:54.470 
crescendo this you cannot teach and this
is<00:02:49.260> why<00:02:49.590> you<00:02:50.580> cannot<00:02:51.120> teach<00:02:53.180> what<00:02:54.180> you<00:02:54.209> would

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
is why you cannot teach what you would

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.870 
is why you cannot teach what you would
call<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:55.049> miracle<00:02:55.530> of<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.069> music<00:02:56.459> because

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
call the miracle of the music because

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.339 
call the miracle of the music because
this<00:02:57.090> is<00:02:57.360> beyond<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.920> physics<00:02:59.870> to<00:03:00.870> reduce

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
this is beyond the physics to reduce

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.110 
this is beyond the physics to reduce
that<00:03:01.739> -<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.540> level<00:03:03.959> of<00:03:04.080> the<00:03:04.200> practical

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
that - to the level of the practical

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.870 
that - to the level of the practical
obviously<00:03:06.120> if<00:03:06.330> you<00:03:06.630> have<00:03:07.110> a<00:03:07.530> chord<00:03:08.130> on<00:03:08.670> the

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
obviously if you have a chord on the

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.449 
obviously if you have a chord on the
piano<00:03:09.230> that<00:03:10.230> you<00:03:10.290> want<00:03:10.709> where<00:03:11.069> you<00:03:11.099> want<00:03:11.220> to

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
piano that you want where you want to

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.880 
piano that you want where you want to
create<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:11.940> illusion<00:03:12.060> of<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.630> crescendo<00:03:13.230> you

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
create the illusion of the crescendo you

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.360 
create the illusion of the crescendo you
must<00:03:14.220> imagine<00:03:14.730> that<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:16.170> piano<00:03:16.530> is<00:03:16.890> doing<00:03:17.220> the

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
must imagine that the piano is doing the

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.949 
must imagine that the piano is doing the
crescendo<00:03:17.580> and<00:03:18.090> then<00:03:18.239> when<00:03:18.420> you<00:03:18.540> play<00:03:18.780> the

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
crescendo and then when you play the

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.400 
crescendo and then when you play the
next<00:03:19.170> note<00:03:19.670> that<00:03:20.670> has<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.239> be<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.690> result<00:03:22.200> of

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
next note that has to be the result of

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.120 
next note that has to be the result of
your<00:03:22.829> imaginary<00:03:23.489> crescendo<00:03:24.440> but<00:03:25.440> if<00:03:25.680> you<00:03:25.920> have

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
your imaginary crescendo but if you have

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.940 
your imaginary crescendo but if you have
a<00:03:26.160> negative<00:03:26.489> way<00:03:27.390> of<00:03:27.420> thinking<00:03:28.019> and<00:03:28.200> say<00:03:28.470> the

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
a negative way of thinking and say the

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.949 
a negative way of thinking and say the
piano<00:03:29.220> cannot<00:03:29.670> make<00:03:29.819> a<00:03:29.850> crescendo<00:03:30.120> you<00:03:30.780> will

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
piano cannot make a crescendo you will

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.470 
piano cannot make a crescendo you will
never<00:03:31.170> express<00:03:31.680> them<00:03:31.970> but<00:03:32.970> if<00:03:33.120> you<00:03:33.239> play

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
never express them but if you play

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.030 
never express them but if you play
please<00:03:34.140> and<00:03:34.410> then<00:03:34.859> you<00:03:34.950> play<00:03:35.130> this<00:03:36.049> and<00:03:37.049> you

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
please and then you play this and you

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.520 
please and then you play this and you
will<00:03:38.160> really<00:03:38.660> imagine<00:03:39.660> this<00:03:39.810> person<00:03:40.170> then<00:03:40.380> you

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
will really imagine this person then you

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.129 
will really imagine this person then you
will<00:03:40.560> play<00:03:40.859> the<00:03:40.920> 2nd<00:03:41.459> chord<00:03:41.730> as<00:03:42.120> if<00:03:42.600> it<00:03:42.780> was<00:03:42.959> the

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139 
will play the 2nd chord as if it was the

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:47.270 
will play the 2nd chord as if it was the
result<00:03:43.560> of<00:03:44.130> the<00:03:44.910> crescendo<00:03:45.090> I<00:03:46.100> tried<00:03:47.100> my<00:03:47.250> best

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
result of the crescendo I tried my best

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.720 
result of the crescendo I tried my best
it's<00:03:47.700> a<00:03:47.760> very<00:03:47.940> different<00:03:48.269> question
