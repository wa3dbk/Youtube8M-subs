00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 and then guys, I'm also friends with 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.350
 Babies I'm here with moto x play and the 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.910
 sony and 4 apa 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.530
 we will take the personal test that 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.150
 will run for example samba and cry made 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:18.260
 the two to see is who runs a first one 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:22.170
 only load speed test and 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:26.849
 of the games time ram and time tomorrow 2 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.349
 It's okay, it's just a case click and open the 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.019
 google playgames that I think goes 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.079
 show the time to 12 in you 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.940
 view the part that opens you to the 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.210
 play line is on the way here 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.890
 show you the before but I want 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.559
 show you something here leave this 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.300
 I think I installed it here. 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.489
 I did not arrive I was here so I can not 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.190
 take the test and show how 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.579
 benchmark but I need to restart this 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.160
 here to make a ranking a single one 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.949
 software 71 factory installation 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.170
 let's go first, people do 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.180
 here samba and surprised to know if 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.580
 It is here is here I'll try 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.170
 to click both at the same time not to 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.240
 is that an unfair competition for 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.720
 part of one or the other is giving a 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.460
 Touch to want to want the advantage 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.400
 for either device I want 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:24.259
 that is the test is as fair as possible 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.259
 we were 12 13 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.600
 wash clothes 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.800
 now it seems that and which ones 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:47.550
 The first ox play clothes have 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.920
 update yet 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:53.930
 there is still in the river still in this here already 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.930
 It's in Greece, it 's gracie, that's right. 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:03.350
 Come on and it's over, turning off the screen. 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:07.140
 Not for beauty. 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.360
 let's close the programs know how to speak 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.700
 but here such here with these programs 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.430
 open because I simply had to 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.190
 you will set up the test as well. 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.260
 again no open any abertuta 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.350
 We're going to do another test of 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.410
 kayak of the ambitious not to mention that 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.510
 even he carrying it he could be 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.490
 The faster we could, the more we 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:37.220
 new here everything is clear there 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:39.570
 right on 123 and river and greece 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.730
 I just downloaded this one already has some 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.550
 time but I do not update or it seems that 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:51.840
 now sony took a small 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:53.280
 advantage but the first the homonym x 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.930
 litigation the first 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.100
 basically they have the same processor 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.040
 of staff 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.040
 only the sony is he running the 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.130
 64-bit android and here I am 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.140
 running the 32-bit android're going 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:11.910
 now make time the year, guys, let's go 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:15.150
 1 2 3 and practically the same 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:18.530
 You're there playing the song O 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.530
 first sony 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.790
 here was first in hama bailout is 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.130
 Gave it here. 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.650
 Let's do this again, this is personal. 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.209
 Only, okay, I just forgot to close 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.640
 Your bis made it, huh? 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:45.290
 Come on, let's take the test now. 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:47.540
 again that of the time there 123 and the 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.820
 first here now it seems that in the 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:55.970
 second charge erac same shot in memory 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:59.660
 here was faster on the new x play 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.100
 faster just to take the test 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:07.880
 let's go again 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:10.930
 one two three and it seems that it plays more 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.430
 quick note seeing ox play it seems like 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:18.709
 he still has an advantage over 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:23.360
 to the m 4 of your garden seeing beauty 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:32.740
 OPÁ there we will terminate these here and we 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:32.740
 set time am2 let's go 1 2 3 and here 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:39.710
 there he ended up asking no not worth it 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.500
 test here no personal cost 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.200
 anyway he carried it there he goes 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:49.580
 ask he did not ask the play inside 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.140
 Let's do this test again, is he? 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.880
 has logged into my google account 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:57.860
 playgames same thing here we 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:02.530
 closing the two was not worth 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.530
 Let's go again here 11 23 c 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:15.530
 O here first to see Léo is a range 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:20.300
 huh 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:23.900
 you see he believes he is he did not give a 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.040
 take it here in relation to sony but let's 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.790
 de novo 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:31.340
 Let's go right there in your bosom. 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:33.350
 memory here will not work because 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:36.440
 they will happen they will simply roll 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.310
 You instantly see O tá 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.110
 seeing 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:44.060
 That's why I could not sit down for 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:46.810
 example pick up here and back was to 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.810
 close up 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:55.370
 so ended even now more control 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:59.470
 Let's try to beat her. 123 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:02.470
 It will already work right in the memory, not 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.470
 Pan 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:08.240
 We went out to come back anyway he was. 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:15.230
 latest apps open to the know that 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:17.090
 is the sony claims that it works 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.880
 People are going to take the last test just to 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:22.160
 people 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:26.170
 I closed the two of you and let's go to the 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.170
 Last test now with 12 13 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:41.450
 o again xp law mode took the advantage 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:43.790
 for I see so for the three games 

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:48.320
 that I rode ox play he took a 

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:50.420
 some advantage over the mp4 water 

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:53.060
 good staff even it has a screen 

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:56.810
 5.5 it has a screen of 5 but the 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:58.010
