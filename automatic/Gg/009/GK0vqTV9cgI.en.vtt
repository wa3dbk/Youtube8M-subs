we're gonna have normal and new game+
modes<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:04.890> they'll<00:01:05.070> be<00:01:05.930> they'll<00:01:06.930> be<00:01:06.990> hard<00:01:07.320> but

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
modes so they'll be they'll be hard but

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.010 
modes so they'll be they'll be hard but
fair<00:01:07.770> things<00:01:08.520> for<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.000> regular<00:01:09.450> gamers<00:01:09.810> and

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
fair things for the regular gamers and

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.620 
fair things for the regular gamers and
new<00:01:10.290> game+<00:01:10.680> will<00:01:10.979> contain<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:12.330> how<00:01:12.570> would

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
new game+ will contain and so how would

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.060 
new game+ will contain and so how would
you<00:01:12.780> describe<00:01:13.229> what<00:01:13.409> makes<00:01:13.740> this<00:01:13.890> game

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
you describe what makes this game

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.710 
you describe what makes this game
different<00:01:14.580> from<00:01:14.790> things<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.330> are<00:01:15.479> similar

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
different from things that are similar

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.679 
different from things that are similar
to<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.960> um<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:17.310> think<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.820> biggest<00:01:18.030> differences

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
to it um I think the biggest differences

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.230 
to it um I think the biggest differences
are<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.049> it's<00:01:20.009> our<00:01:20.189> own<00:01:20.400> interpretation<00:01:20.759> of

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
are that it's our own interpretation of

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.990 
are that it's our own interpretation of
what<00:01:21.750> genres<00:01:22.380> in<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.560> past<00:01:22.799> have<00:01:23.250> done<00:01:23.280> with

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
what genres in the past have done with

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.289 
what genres in the past have done with
these<00:01:24.210> games<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:25.340> we'd<00:01:26.340> take<00:01:26.369> simple<00:01:27.000> things

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
these games so we'd take simple things

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.350 
these games so we'd take simple things
like<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.659> dash<00:01:27.900> or<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.380> jump<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.340> fine-tune<00:01:30.210> it

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
like the dash or a jump and fine-tune it

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.590 
like the dash or a jump and fine-tune it
to<00:01:30.570> what<00:01:30.900> we<00:01:31.680> think<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.610> know<00:01:33.240> more

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
to what we think is you know more

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.410 
to what we think is you know more
natural<00:01:34.020> for<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.890> games<00:01:35.100> we<00:01:35.310> like<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:36.000> it

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
natural for the games we like and it

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.940 
natural for the games we like and it
feels<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.810> bit<00:01:36.840> more<00:01:36.960> modern<00:01:37.259> because<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.829> that

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
feels a bit more modern because of that

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.590 
feels a bit more modern because of that
I<00:01:38.159> definitely<00:01:38.579> agree<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:38.850> jumping<00:01:39.270> does<00:01:39.450> go

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
I definitely agree that jumping does go

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.940 
I definitely agree that jumping does go
at<00:01:39.840> 1:1<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.229> in<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.439> it's<00:01:40.619> kind<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.829> more

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
at 1:1 and in that it's kind of more

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.289 
at 1:1 and in that it's kind of more
intuitive<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.490> could<00:01:41.610> move<00:01:41.820> around<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
intuitive you could move around in the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.359 
intuitive you could move around in the
air<00:01:42.509> all<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:42.930> kind<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.200> stuff<00:01:43.290> yes<00:01:43.950> and

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
air all of that kind of stuff yes and

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.100 
air all of that kind of stuff yes and
the<00:01:44.640> speed<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.119> characters<00:01:45.540> faster<00:01:45.990> than

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
the speed of the characters faster than

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.990 
the speed of the characters faster than
most<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.530> old<00:01:46.710> games<00:01:46.979> so<00:01:47.369> there's<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.909> lot

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
most of the old games so there's a lot

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.160 
most of the old games so there's a lot
of<00:01:48.119> fine-tuning<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.630> stuff<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:49.020> we<00:01:49.110> still

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
of fine-tuning and stuff that we still

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.240 
of fine-tuning and stuff that we still
want<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.799> do<00:01:50.009> but<00:01:50.310> it's<00:01:51.079> 90%<00:01:52.079> there<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.710> that's

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
want to do but it's 90% there and that's

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.560 
want to do but it's 90% there and that's
we're<00:01:53.549> hoping<00:01:53.790> everybody<00:01:54.119> else<00:01:54.240> feels<00:01:54.450> that

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
we're hoping everybody else feels that

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.010 
we're hoping everybody else feels that
way<00:01:54.780> too

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
way too

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.719 
way too
definitely<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:56.040> know<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.189> art<00:01:56.340> director

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
definitely and you know the art director

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.520 
definitely and you know the art director
this<00:01:56.909> game<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.270> very<00:01:57.750> different<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.320> anything

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
this game is very different to anything

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.870 
this game is very different to anything
I've<00:01:58.770> seen<00:01:58.920> in<00:01:59.130> terms<00:01:59.250> about<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.670> kind<00:01:59.850> of

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
I've seen in terms about it kind of

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.060 
I've seen in terms about it kind of
feels<00:02:00.060> like<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.479> was<00:02:00.689> saying<00:02:00.869> Popeye<00:02:01.200> mixed

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
feels like I was saying Popeye mixed

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.709 
feels like I was saying Popeye mixed
with<00:02:02.219> Mickey<00:02:02.759> Mouse<00:02:02.790> so<00:02:03.360> what<00:02:03.509> was<00:02:03.630> the

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
with Mickey Mouse so what was the

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.600 
with Mickey Mouse so what was the
inspiration<00:02:03.930> for<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:04.500> just<00:02:04.890> as<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.040> joke<00:02:05.369> I

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
inspiration for that just as a joke I

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.700 
inspiration for that just as a joke I
created<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.149> concept<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.780> see<00:02:06.930> how<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.439> would<00:02:07.530> go

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
created a concept to see how it would go

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.350 
created a concept to see how it would go
over<00:02:07.860> with<00:02:08.099> our<00:02:08.250> peers<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:08.700> friends<00:02:09.209> and

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
over with our peers and friends and

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.760 
over with our peers and friends and
everybody<00:02:09.929> loved<00:02:10.170> it

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
everybody loved it

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.710 
everybody loved it
so<00:02:10.920> that's<00:02:11.310> we<00:02:11.700> went<00:02:11.850> forward<00:02:12.150> with<00:02:12.330> this<00:02:12.450> look

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
so that's we went forward with this look

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.830 
so that's we went forward with this look
and<00:02:13.130> to<00:02:14.130> our<00:02:14.370> like<00:02:14.760> we're<00:02:15.000> so<00:02:15.240> surprised<00:02:15.660> that

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
and to our like we're so surprised that

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.010 
and to our like we're so surprised that
nobody<00:02:16.200> else<00:02:16.350> has<00:02:16.650> tried<00:02:17.300> like<00:02:18.300> a<00:02:18.480> cartoony

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
nobody else has tried like a cartoony

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.780 
nobody else has tried like a cartoony
look<00:02:19.200> in<00:02:19.320> a<00:02:19.380> game<00:02:19.560> before<00:02:19.770> yeah<00:02:20.340> it's<00:02:20.520> very

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
look in a game before yeah it's very

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.230 
look in a game before yeah it's very
unique<00:02:20.970> so<00:02:21.300> I<00:02:21.330> have<00:02:21.570> to<00:02:21.660> ask<00:02:21.810> why<00:02:22.290> cuphead

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
unique so I have to ask why cuphead

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.230 
unique so I have to ask why cuphead
cuphead<00:02:24.240> ism<00:02:24.680> comes<00:02:25.680> from<00:02:26.070> iteration<00:02:26.970> of<00:02:27.120> a

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
cuphead ism comes from iteration of a

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.390 
cuphead ism comes from iteration of a
ton<00:02:27.420> of<00:02:27.450> different<00:02:27.690> characters<00:02:28.230> we<00:02:29.010> wanted<00:02:29.310> to

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
ton of different characters we wanted to

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.130 
ton of different characters we wanted to
have<00:02:29.520> something<00:02:29.760> unique<00:02:30.150> that<00:02:30.390> felt<00:02:30.870> like

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
have something unique that felt like

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.530 
have something unique that felt like
people<00:02:31.350> have<00:02:31.650> seen<00:02:31.950> this<00:02:32.130> in<00:02:32.400> old<00:02:32.970> cartoons

people have seen this in old cartoons

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.650 
people have seen this in old cartoons
but<00:02:34.230> we<00:02:34.350> didn't<00:02:34.620> want<00:02:34.800> to<00:02:34.950> copy<00:02:35.430> dogs<00:02:36.030> cats
