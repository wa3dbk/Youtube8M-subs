00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
regards to our stud kit he watched the

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.040 
regards to our stud kit he watched the
video<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.760> he<00:00:27.090> wanted<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.510> know<00:00:27.660> if<00:00:27.689> it<00:00:27.900> was

basically<00:00:30.359> what<00:00:30.570> happened<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:30.990> this<00:00:31.140> customer

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
basically what happened to this customer

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.500 
basically what happened to this customer
is<00:00:31.830> this<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.790> whole<00:00:32.969> reason<00:00:33.300> why<00:00:33.390> we

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
is this is the whole reason why we

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.510 
is this is the whole reason why we
developed<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:33.960> stud<00:00:34.170> kit<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.530> because<00:00:34.890> the

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
developed the stud kit is because the

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.660 
developed the stud kit is because the
bolt<00:00:36.360> holes<00:00:36.690> right<00:00:36.960> here<00:00:37.020> that<00:00:37.770> mount<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.250> the

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
bolt holes right here that mount the the

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.889 
bolt holes right here that mount the the
fuel<00:00:38.940> pump<00:00:39.180> which<00:00:39.960> mounts<00:00:40.320> in<00:00:41.129> here<00:00:41.840> they<00:00:42.840> were

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
fuel pump which mounts in here they were

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.450 
fuel pump which mounts in here they were
stripped<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.950> reason<00:00:44.219> why<00:00:44.309> they're

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
stripped and the reason why they're

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.819 
stripped and the reason why they're
stripped<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:44.879> because<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.750> lot<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.530> people<00:00:46.739> are

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
stripped is because a lot of people are

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.680 
stripped is because a lot of people are
checking<00:00:47.129> their<00:00:47.610> cam-follower<00:00:48.149> because<00:00:48.539> it's

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
checking their cam-follower because it's

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.369 
checking their cam-follower because it's
become<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.230> very<00:00:50.390> very<00:00:51.390> common<00:00:51.690> knowledge<00:00:51.989> now

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
become a very very common knowledge now

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.869 
become a very very common knowledge now
that<00:00:52.590> checking<00:00:53.190> your<00:00:53.280> cam<00:00:53.460> follower<00:00:53.789> is

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
that checking your cam follower is

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.750 
that checking your cam follower is
important<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:55.410> should<00:00:55.440> do<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.489> what

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
important and you should do so so what

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.830 
important and you should do so so what
happens<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.239> lot<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.449> people<00:00:57.600> check<00:00:57.809> their

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
happens is a lot of people check their

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.510 
happens is a lot of people check their
cam<00:00:58.109> followers<00:00:58.530> they<00:00:58.680> take<00:00:58.859> these<00:00:59.039> bolts<00:00:59.370> in

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
cam followers they take these bolts in

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.580 
cam followers they take these bolts in
and<00:00:59.670> out<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.789> bunch<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.239> times<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:01.289> creates

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
and out a bunch of times and it creates

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.100 
and out a bunch of times and it creates
a<00:01:01.710> problem<00:01:02.039> where<00:01:02.219> these<00:01:02.820> these<00:01:03.510> threads<00:01:03.899> will

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
a problem where these these threads will

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.380 
a problem where these these threads will
strip<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.129> customer<00:01:05.549> contacted<00:01:06.150> us<00:01:06.210> and

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
strip so the customer contacted us and

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.420 
strip so the customer contacted us and
asking<00:01:06.780> us<00:01:06.960> if<00:01:07.229> this<00:01:07.470> if<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.040> studs<00:01:08.340> were

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
asking us if this if the studs were

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.800 
asking us if this if the studs were
going<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.610> be<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.760> good<00:01:08.970> option<00:01:09.090> for<00:01:09.510> him<00:01:09.570> and

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
going to be a good option for him and

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.750 
going to be a good option for him and
really<00:01:10.560> what<00:01:10.740> ended<00:01:10.950> up<00:01:11.040> happening<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.640> we

asking us about repairing this cover or
replacing<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.299> what<00:01:21.299> happens<00:01:21.689> when<00:01:21.840> these

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
replacing it and what happens when these

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.140 
replacing it and what happens when these
bolt<00:01:22.200> strip<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.770> you're<00:01:23.400> gonna<00:01:23.520> remove<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:24.000> lot

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
bolt strip is you're gonna remove a lot

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.580 
bolt strip is you're gonna remove a lot
of<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.299> metal<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.020> lot<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.259> people<00:01:25.409> are

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
of the metal and so a lot of people are

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.740 
of the metal and so a lot of people are
going<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.770> try<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:25.950> either<00:01:26.610> helicoidal<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.509> or

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
going to try to either helicoidal it or

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.539 
going to try to either helicoidal it or
have<00:01:28.229> or<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.710> have<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.979> replace<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.460> entire

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
have or you have to replace the entire

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.550 
have or you have to replace the entire
cover<00:01:30.119> itself<00:01:30.509> now<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:30.900> an<00:01:31.049> expensive

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
cover itself now this is an expensive

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.940 
cover itself now this is an expensive
car<00:01:31.770> part<00:01:32.509> but<00:01:33.509> here<00:01:33.689> are<00:01:33.810> our<00:01:33.930> concerns<00:01:34.140> with

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
car part but here are our concerns with

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.520 
car part but here are our concerns with
helicoidal<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:36.390> Gila<00:01:36.570> coil<00:01:36.810> might<00:01:36.990> be<00:01:37.200> a

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
helicoidal the Gila coil might be a

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.580 
helicoidal the Gila coil might be a
viable<00:01:37.979> repair<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.700> could<00:01:38.850> work<00:01:39.030> but<00:01:39.869> the

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
viable repair and it could work but the

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.620 
viable repair and it could work but the
problem<00:01:41.040> is<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.729> high<00:01:41.939> pressure<00:01:42.210> fuel<00:01:42.329> pump

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
problem is the high pressure fuel pump

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.510 
problem is the high pressure fuel pump
especially<00:01:43.320> on<00:01:43.439> an<00:01:43.530> upgraded<00:01:43.979> car<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.310> uses

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
especially on an upgraded car that uses

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.240 
especially on an upgraded car that uses
a<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.970> upgraded<00:01:45.590> high-pressure<00:01:46.590> performance

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
a a upgraded high-pressure performance

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
engine so we were trying to kind of give

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.070 
engine so we were trying to kind of give
him<00:02:28.290> an<00:02:28.380> advice<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:28.650> say<00:02:29.490> that<00:02:29.670> he'll<00:02:30.030> coil<00:02:30.390> it

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
him an advice to say that he'll coil it

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.780 
him an advice to say that he'll coil it
could<00:02:31.320> be<00:02:31.470> a<00:02:31.500> viable<00:02:31.740> option<00:02:32.010> but<00:02:32.400> we<00:02:32.520> wouldn't

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
could be a viable option but we wouldn't

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.610 
could be a viable option but we wouldn't
recommend<00:02:33.030> it<00:02:33.240> just<00:02:33.450> because<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:34.410> could

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
recommend it just because you could

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.890 
recommend it just because you could
present<00:02:34.800> potentially<00:02:35.580> cost<00:02:35.790> yourself<00:02:36.000> even

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
present potentially cost yourself even

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.610 
present potentially cost yourself even
more<00:02:37.080> money<00:02:37.620> after<00:02:38.400> a<00:02:38.790> repair<00:02:39.480> like<00:02:39.720> that<00:02:39.930> so

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
more money after a repair like that so

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.100 
more money after a repair like that so
here<00:02:40.800> we<00:02:40.950> have<00:02:41.100> an<00:02:41.250> FSI<00:02:41.670> cylinder<00:02:42.150> head<00:02:42.300> we

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
here we have an FSI cylinder head we

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.540 
here we have an FSI cylinder head we
just<00:02:43.260> wanted<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.500> show<00:02:43.710> you<00:02:43.740> this<00:02:44.040> just<00:02:44.340> for<00:02:44.490> a

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
just wanted to show you this just for a

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.770 
just wanted to show you this just for a
reference<00:02:44.910> so<00:02:45.600> here<00:02:45.870> is<00:02:46.020> where<00:02:47.330> this<00:02:48.330> cover

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
reference so here is where this cover

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.050 
reference so here is where this cover
were<00:02:49.020> discussing<00:02:49.710> mounts<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:50.220> this<00:02:50.790> would<00:02:50.940> be

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
were discussing mounts and this would be

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.780 
were discussing mounts and this would be
mounted<00:02:51.240> on<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:52.400> driver's<00:02:53.400> side<00:02:53.580> of<00:02:53.640> the

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
mounted on the driver's side of the

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.520 
mounted on the driver's side of the
cylinder<00:02:54.150> head<00:02:54.270> so<00:02:54.780> it<00:02:54.959> would<00:02:55.080> be<00:02:55.170> in<00:02:55.260> a<00:02:55.350> car

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
cylinder head so it would be in a car

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.560 
cylinder head so it would be in a car
just<00:02:55.740> like<00:02:55.890> this<00:02:56.100> and<00:02:56.310> this<00:02:56.880> is<00:02:57.060> we<00:02:57.390> have<00:02:57.540> our

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
just like this and this is we have our

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.360 
just like this and this is we have our
stud<00:02:58.020> kit<00:02:58.260> already<00:02:58.530> previously<00:02:58.920> installed

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
stud kit already previously installed

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.400 
stud kit already previously installed
this<00:02:59.610> is<00:02:59.670> where<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.030> bolts<00:03:00.390> go<00:03:00.480> that<00:03:01.260> we're

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
this is where the bolts go that we're

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.980 
this is where the bolts go that we're
mentioning<00:03:01.890> that<00:03:01.980> it<00:03:02.130> gets<00:03:02.280> stripped<00:03:02.490> out<00:03:02.730> and

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
mentioning that it gets stripped out and

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.910 
mentioning that it gets stripped out and
the<00:03:03.990> fuel<00:03:04.230> pump<00:03:04.640> would<00:03:05.640> mount<00:03:05.880> just<00:03:06.209> like<00:03:06.390> so

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
the fuel pump would mount just like so

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.130 
the fuel pump would mount just like so
on<00:03:07.920> top<00:03:08.250> of<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:08.520> studs<00:03:08.790> so<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:10.500> reason<00:03:10.920> why<00:03:12.140> we

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
on top of the studs so the reason why we

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.260 
on top of the studs so the reason why we
have<00:03:13.290> this<00:03:13.470> stud<00:03:13.680> kit<00:03:13.860> and<00:03:14.070> this<00:03:14.190> is<00:03:14.490> again<00:03:15.030> a

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
have this stud kit and this is again a

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.390 
have this stud kit and this is again a
more<00:03:15.750> of<00:03:15.840> a<00:03:15.930> preventative<00:03:16.350> this<00:03:16.830> can<00:03:17.040> help<00:03:17.160> you

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
more of a preventative this can help you

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.280 
more of a preventative this can help you
installing<00:03:18.360> these<00:03:18.450> before<00:03:18.840> you<00:03:18.989> have<00:03:19.170> this

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
installing these before you have this

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.930 
installing these before you have this
problem<00:03:19.560> can<00:03:19.920> prevent<00:03:20.160> you<00:03:20.310> from<00:03:20.370> ever<00:03:20.580> having

problem can prevent you from ever having
to<00:03:21.120> have<00:03:21.269> the<00:03:21.420> problem<00:03:21.720> because<00:03:22.080> the<00:03:22.709> studs<00:03:23.040> go

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
to have the problem because the studs go

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.770 
to have the problem because the studs go
in<00:03:23.489> but<00:03:23.730> they<00:03:23.820> don't<00:03:23.850> need<00:03:24.090> to<00:03:24.209> come<00:03:24.420> in<00:03:24.630> and
