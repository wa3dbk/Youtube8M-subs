 universal 

00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:45.369
 just because they are able to perform 

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:48.259
 virtually any combat mission but this 

00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:50.119

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.650
 by myself 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.650
 the starting point was the defense plant 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.760
 the city is full of thin where they collect these

 By the way the modern version of the traditional 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.200
 for Russian armenia 8 significantly 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.119
 has changed 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.439
 there was a modern system 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.630
 navigation new means of communication with 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.270
 headquarters 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.149
 and now the crew can independently 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:30.000
 monitor the state of the environment 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.570
 but we are on the threshold 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.370
 besides under the cut 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.890
 that allow 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.890
 predict where are the dangerous on 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.990
 half a year along the route 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.950
 this plot is required 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.700
 helicopters of this class are 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.450
 the most common 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.270
 its progress over history 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.450
 the structure of such machines was released 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.039

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.039
 refuse to be able to 

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:34.770
