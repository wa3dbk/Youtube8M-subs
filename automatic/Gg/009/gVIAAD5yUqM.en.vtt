00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.849
 it seemed that the moment would never come 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:25.130
 but the witcher 3 is already between 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.529
 we giralte rivia has its expected 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.720
 New adventure completed cd projekt red 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.759
 has set his most ambitious videogame 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.649
 to date and also one really 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.140
 outstanding the most launch 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.879
 expected of the year is already finished you're 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.909
 prepared to know what he has given of 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:39.909
 yes 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.820
 the legend of geralt de rivia writes 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.010
 another chapter more on this occasion all 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.719
 begins with the search for Jennifer without 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.489
 However, the thing does not take long to get complicated 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:52.960
 and in revealing to his villain that not only 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:57.300
 it's going to make things very difficult for us 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.300
 but also gives name to the video game 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.420
 as always in the saga the witcher the 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.309
 history is followed with a lot of interest 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.500
 not in vain books in which 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.720
 based are brilliant the missions are 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.580
 very well written and the feeling is so 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.140
 positive that even the characters of 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.420
 cast are tremendously well 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.369
 plotted all the inhabitants of your world 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.470
 they have their own stories often 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.360
 very sad and sordid and that go very 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.979
 the line of the novels in fact the 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.930
 game has many winks that the most 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.909
 fans of the books will identify with 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.680
 ease but do not worry if you do not 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.750
 you read them or if you have not enjoyed 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.700
 the previous games waveland te 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.229
 explains everything you need to know and 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.360
 it even allows you to make the decisions 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.899
 why you would have opted in assassins 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.899
 of kings 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.430
 in addition cd projekt red has not spared 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.960
 in resources when narrating and not 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.580
 it deprives of changing sometimes even the 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.200
 point of view for a story that does not 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.299
 It has the exclusive protagonist 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.250
 gerald during some parts of the 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.590
 program we will take control of siri 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.210
 they are small sequences but that we 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.310
 help empathize better with one of the 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.610
 key personalities of the 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.610
 work 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.500
 with these good wicks only 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.120
 missing a selection of missions to the 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.220
 height and the truth is that in lines 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.930
 Generals comply with a note of pity 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.759
 that there are so many that break the rhythm with 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.560
 boring investigations based on 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.390
 observe scenarios with the instinct of 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.520
 sorcerer and that there are also many other 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.230
 tontorronas if you fill up on cast 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.420
 house rats or find goats 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.860
 lost all of them seem something out 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.130
 of place for a sorcerer of our 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.130
 skills 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.700
 at the playable level the witcher 3 is divided 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.440
 in several parts the most novel is the 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.090
 of exploration and it must be said that the 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.520
 open world feels very good to the 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.470
 saga there are huge natural surfaces and 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.240
 very beautiful and with many things that 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.860
 discover and there are also beautiful 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.260
 cities that we can travel to 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.510
 trade find missions play at 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.720
 letters or just soak up your 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.720
 beauty 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.019
 we must clarify that it is not a world 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.549
 totally open but rather one in 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.349
 which we have to go through a map 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.659
 general to travel to the different 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:00.400
 areas these are separated by times 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:02.049
 of loading but the surfaces of the 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.560
 maps are huge so we do not 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.560
 will matter 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.690
 combat is another of the strong points 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.520
 of the release we have again between 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.620
 hands the classic mix between sword of 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.540
 steel for human and silver enemies 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.710
 for the beasts and magic will do the 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.780
 rest 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.850
 we also have accessories like a 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.350
 crossbow to attack from a distance 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.600
 set of all this is a system 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.190
 simple but that works especially 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.690
 in some memorable moments like 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.540
 when we face beasts 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.580
 Fabulous some but yes minor 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.410
 the controls that the saga have always 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.330
 been somewhat rough they do not abandon us in 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.490
 this occasion and it costs a bit to make 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.930
 with them and the camera does not always help 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.530
 sometimes it is somewhat capricious in 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.530
 closed spaces 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.069
 apart from killing one of the things that 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.900
 more we are going to do is talk the dialogues 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.299
 They are scathing and loaded with replicas 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.439
 very few very powerful we can 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.510
 intervene in conversations 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:59.459
 choosing the lines of dialogue to 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.290
 pronounce and always have a lot 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.359
 careful since we 're going to provoke 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.519
 very important consequences with what 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:07.859
 let's decide also opens some that we 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.629
 they force you to quickly decide all this 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:11.549
 it's important because you get right with how 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:13.560
 we must treat this or that character or 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.450
 lend a hand when you need us 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.459
 You can earn us succulent discounts 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.820
 in the complete trading system of the 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.820
 game 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.749
 that we lack the role plays are usually 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:27.669
 have a good progression system and 

00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:29.530
 this could not be an exception 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:31.599
 many options to perfect yesterday 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.189
 art in different disciplines and also 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:35.169
 We will have to be very aware of 

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:38.490
 our team to improve it repair it 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.490
 whenever necessary 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.620
 in everything concerning the aesthetic the 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.660
 witcher 3 offers in general terms the 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.490
 beauty that we expected from him although he is 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.770
 a little bit rougher than what 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.050
 it seemed graphically the title of cd 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.510
 projekt network is a waste of light 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.670
 the textures the polygonal charge all 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.410
 shows a fantastic finish not only in 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.210
 the artistic part but also in its 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.280
 staging and is counted among the 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.140
 most impressive jobs we've seen 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.430
 in recent times keeping in mind 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.430
 your sandbox status 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.300
 however if we stay with what 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.250
 purely technical the work of the study 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.139
 Polish shows results more 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.580
 discrete animations and their 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:21.650
 Chained have left us feelings 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.750
 irregular also in terms of 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.819
 performance in powerful fish is going to look 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.620
 scandalously good but suffers 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:29.479
 enough to maintain composure in 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.310
 nexgen consoles where during the 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:34.189
 combats suffers brutal falls in the 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.719
 rate of images per second so 

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:37.490
 others the title has a good 

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:39.530
 number of bugs and faults of different 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.750
 type although none of them goes beyond 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.460
 of the cosmetic would be easy slaughter will 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.379
 of widget 3 for it as it has been done 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.940
 with other recent releases but 

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:48.650
 with open world games we tend 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.870
 to take into account how complex it is 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.400
 create your universes and especially not 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.780
 be hard when your problems do not 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:58.150
 directly affect an experience 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.150
 playable that is so fun and ambitious 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.330
 to close the audiovisual facet we 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:05.190
 it remains to speak of sound the soundtrack 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.650
 it's fantastic with a lot of topics 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:09.360
 formidable of extraordinary invoice the 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.920
 game comes with the possibility of being 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.110
 enjoyed in several languages that do not 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:15.270
 they include Spanish although the texts do 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.850
 are translated with such a size 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:20.600
 small that it is recommended to have 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.600
 good view 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.800
 the witcher 3 has already arrived has 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:29.810
 some tiny edges to polish like 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.730
 some missions that weaken a finish 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.860
 irregular technical and a combat something 

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:35.990
 less complex than we expected without 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.360
 But everything else is brilliant and cd 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.830
 projekt network sets another outstanding rpg 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.700
 to put the brooch to a saga of 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.590
 legend 

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.270
 queralt heads an adventure loaded with 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:46.190
 action and exploration in some of the 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:50.290
 most beautiful places that we have seen in 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:50.290
 the last times and that's worth a lot
