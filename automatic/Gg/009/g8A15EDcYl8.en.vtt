00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:16.020
 hi everyone with you lech and this is the 35 series 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.590
 funny and funny moments of the world 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.160
 tanks 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.880
 and we start with the replay 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.599
 Subscriber sent by senator deja vu 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.240
 yes that’s how the 33 release started 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.940
 but in this we start the series with moments 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.730
 which happened to the senator now he 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.210
 on apt-2 which is probably even more 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.120
 random and oblique fluff what su-152 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.610
 but this does not prevent him from getting on e25 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.070
 which disappeared from the light I remind you that 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.230
 aiming system in a game such that 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.300
 if you aim your opponent on the mountain 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.430
 and then he disappears then the sight 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.920
 automatically translated into the sky for 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.440
 the opponent and if it’s not 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.900
 causing particular problems they fly almost 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.570
 in a straight line, the fugsy chooses the trajectory 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:07.350
 in an arc and the projectile flies unknown where 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.780
 but in this case right on target but it 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.810
 not all tags and hits from senator on 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.300
 q2 in this fight at the end of the fight he sees 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.270
 minimap helcket outside the square 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.430
 drawing and trying to target it and bye 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.820
 he does it hellcat disappears from 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.840
 light but the senator still shoots 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.550
 this direction and kills su-100 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:35.180
 who was still invisible 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.180
 magic shots cannon square-2 again a day 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:44.240
 and now the qian game is a bunch of numbers in german 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.970
 premium f-shki e25 which is on a live map 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.030
 oks takes the standard position for pt 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.700
 on a hill on e2 i use incredible 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.280
 masking the e25 which is not even visible 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.400
 after the shot, he begins to disassemble 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.410
 enemy firefly 59 16 tries 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.390
 slip away on the way out 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.570
 almost all their hepe 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.270
 Only 45 units of strength remain 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.250
 well I can't get to 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:14.180
 it doesn’t get too far 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:16.490
 it is necessary to get Natasha from the last 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.910
 forces slipping out of the light and leaving 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.720
 bounds of drawing square save it like 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.450
 would be wrong 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:28.460
 the next e25 shot at probable 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:30.350
 finishes the trajectory 59 16 like this 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:35.080
 turned out to get apparently 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.080
 I don't kill the invisible enemy 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.400
 in the third moment both the coffin and theft 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.790
 su-100 puts on a position on the map or 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.900
 kholov for lumbago for moving 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.360
 the enemy is looking for Braga 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.850
 appears in the light of the rank of our hero 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.390
 shoots too late china slips away 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.880
 but dies not illuminated e81 yes 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.450
 of course, enemies can check in groups 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.430
 but still it's not real so get 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.700
 After all, he had to light up a little 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:15.640
 later and this allowed the snatches as well as 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:19.860
 and chela slip but not this time in 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.860
 this time the choice is on the su-100 side 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:27.430
 in the next moment we steppe isu-152 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:30.580
 player eugen 72 which takes the position 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.260
 at the base of the bushes in this position is convenient 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.730
 shoot at the enemy who with 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.970
 opposite side 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.580
 took the same position which can 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.130
 Highlight Allied lt which will pass 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.850
 either centered or undermined by stones on 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:48.549
 at7 but there are no fireflies in this battle 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.200
 the hero decides to shoot the blinds because 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.890
 probably from the same side 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:57.010
 the opponent also stands the way it is 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:04:00.190
 enemy type 58 6 left for some reason came out 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:03.310
 in battle erects waffentur am 8 levla and 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:06.430
 went to hell with dozens and what to confirm 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:11.100
 it is also his joke without light in the very 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.100
 the beginning of the battle welcome to hell 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:22.230
 finally object 140 player mage snake 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.510
 erlenberg standard battle our hero 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.970
 and it takes a position on the right flank 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.940
 maximum damage to the enemy as 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:33.150
 here highlight dt 131 in the center of the map 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.550
 so so the store nike returns null . 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.790
 another Kazakh hid behind the buildings 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:41.400
 moves and disappears from the light but our 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.980
 the hero knowingly has three stars on the trunk 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.930
 it calculates the trajectory of movement in over 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.120
 and finds available chamber by 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:51.330
 possible route and when vase 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.700
 the object is lost already reduced this place 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.580
 it remains only to choose the moment of the shot 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:59.490
 but with the timing of our hero all 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:03.210
 excellent and accurate shot on moving 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:05.580
 invisible to the enemy carry base 131 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.950
 pangan is really masterful 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:12.290
 a shot probably our hero hunter or 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.290
 sniper from life and not just in the game 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:38.620
