I'd<00:00:00.240> like<00:00:00.359> to<00:00:00.480> show<00:00:00.630> you<00:00:00.690> two<00:00:01.290> ways<00:00:01.319> to<00:00:01.530> make<00:00:01.860> a

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
I'd like to show you two ways to make a

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.030 
I'd like to show you two ways to make a
cone<00:00:02.449> one<00:00:03.449> is<00:00:03.629> with<00:00:03.840> the<00:00:04.259> line<00:00:04.440> tool<00:00:04.740> we're

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
cone one is with the line tool we're

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.430 
cone one is with the line tool we're
gonna<00:00:05.160> use<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.580> follow<00:00:05.850> me<00:00:05.970> tool<00:00:06.170> just<00:00:07.170> draw<00:00:07.410> a

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
gonna use the follow me tool just draw a

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.490 
gonna use the follow me tool just draw a
line<00:00:07.680> up<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:08.010> blue<00:00:08.189> axis<00:00:09.019> down<00:00:10.019> to<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.320> red

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
line up the blue axis down to the red

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.910 
line up the blue axis down to the red
and<00:00:11.219> then<00:00:11.429> back<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.790> origin<00:00:12.679> I'm<00:00:13.679> gonna

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
and then back to the origin I'm gonna

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.930 
and then back to the origin I'm gonna
grab<00:00:14.099> a<00:00:14.130> circle<00:00:16.340> and<00:00:17.340> just<00:00:17.490> make<00:00:17.640> it<00:00:17.820> bigger

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
grab a circle and just make it bigger

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.019 
grab a circle and just make it bigger
than<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:19.260> triangle<00:00:19.740> you<00:00:19.830> have<00:00:20.010> there<00:00:20.279> if

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
than the the triangle you have there if

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.609 
than the the triangle you have there if
you<00:00:21.180> want<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.480> be<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.630> smooth<00:00:21.990> cone<00:00:22.350> you

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
you want it to be a smooth cone you

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.060 
you want it to be a smooth cone you
might<00:00:22.830> want<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.100> type<00:00:23.279> in<00:00:23.490> 100's<00:00:24.210> here<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.890> make

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
might want to type in 100's here to make

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.269 
might want to type in 100's here to make
it<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.279> 100<00:00:26.789> sided<00:00:27.180> circle<00:00:27.859> just<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:28.980> little<00:00:29.189> bit

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
it a 100 sided circle just a little bit

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.389 
it a 100 sided circle just a little bit
smoother<00:00:30.410> I'm<00:00:31.410> not<00:00:31.590> gonna<00:00:31.740> grab<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.160> arrow

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
smoother I'm not gonna grab the arrow

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.080 
smoother I'm not gonna grab the arrow
and<00:00:32.880> click<00:00:33.030> on<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.480> circular<00:00:33.960> base<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:35.130> then

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
and click on the circular base and then

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.290 
and click on the circular base and then
the<00:00:36.210> follow<00:00:36.480> me<00:00:36.600> tool<00:00:37.550> and<00:00:38.550> then<00:00:38.700> finally<00:00:39.090> on

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
the follow me tool and then finally on

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.950 
the follow me tool and then finally on
the<00:00:39.570> triangle<00:00:40.020> itself<00:00:40.730> that<00:00:41.730> will<00:00:41.969> zoom

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
the triangle itself that will zoom

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.790 
the triangle itself that will zoom
around<00:00:44.570> you<00:00:45.570> can<00:00:45.750> see<00:00:45.899> that<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.140> inside<00:00:46.530> now

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
around you can see that the inside now

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.580 
around you can see that the inside now
is<00:00:47.100> as<00:00:47.430> conical<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:48.870> can<00:00:49.050> erase<00:00:49.320> that

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
is as conical and you can erase that

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.650 
is as conical and you can erase that
base<00:00:50.270> if<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.420> don't<00:00:51.600> longer<00:00:51.870> what<00:00:53.510> all<00:00:54.510> right

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
base if you don't longer what all right

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.350 
base if you don't longer what all right
that's<00:00:54.870> one<00:00:55.050> way<00:00:55.230> another<00:00:55.890> way<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.460> with<00:00:56.760> just

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
that's one way another way is with just

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.939 
that's one way another way is with just
a<00:00:57.570> circle<00:00:58.289> here<00:01:00.590> for<00:01:01.590> example<00:01:03.470> and<00:01:04.470> I'm<00:01:04.799> gonna

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
a circle here for example and I'm gonna

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.859 
a circle here for example and I'm gonna
use<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.400> push/pull<00:01:05.640> tool<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:07.250> make<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.430> tall

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
use the push/pull tool to make it tall

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.710 
use the push/pull tool to make it tall
if<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:10.049> want<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.470> be<00:01:10.619> as<00:01:10.799> tall<00:01:11.040> as<00:01:11.450> that<00:01:12.450> cone

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
if I want it to be as tall as that cone

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.820 
if I want it to be as tall as that cone
there<00:01:13.020> there<00:01:13.350> we<00:01:13.470> go<00:01:14.330> then<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:16.049> can<00:01:16.320> highlight

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
there there we go then you can highlight

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.980 
there there we go then you can highlight
you<00:01:17.520> with<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.759> arrow<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.420> can<00:01:18.450> highlight<00:01:18.720> the

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
you with the arrow you can highlight the

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.090 
you with the arrow you can highlight the
top<00:01:19.200> circle<00:01:19.850> change<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.090> scale<00:01:21.950> that<00:01:22.950> can

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
top circle change the scale that can

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.410 
top circle change the scale that can
either<00:01:23.340> be<00:01:23.430> done<00:01:23.460> here<00:01:23.909> with<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.180> scale

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
either be done here with the scale

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.929 
either be done here with the scale
button<00:01:24.720> or<00:01:25.290> by<00:01:25.470> pressing<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:26.009> letter<00:01:26.220> S<00:01:26.490> on

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.370 
button or by pressing the letter S on
the<00:01:27.710> keyboard<00:01:28.909> and<00:01:29.909> now<00:01:30.150> if<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.780> grab<00:01:31.049> one<00:01:31.079> of

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
the keyboard and now if I grab one of

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.490 
the keyboard and now if I grab one of
the<00:01:31.880> little<00:01:32.880> handle<00:01:33.210> bar<00:01:33.329> corners<00:01:33.869> here<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.140> can

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
the little handle bar corners here I can

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.620 
the little handle bar corners here I can
change<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.009> scale<00:01:35.150> but<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.210> want<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.479> make<00:01:36.600> sure

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
change the scale but I want to make sure

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.080 
change the scale but I want to make sure
that<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:36.930> do<00:01:37.049> so<00:01:37.439> about<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.920> center<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:38.909> if<00:01:39.000> you

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
that I do so about the center so if you

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.899 
that I do so about the center so if you
look<00:01:39.240> down<00:01:39.270> here<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.930> tells<00:01:40.140> us<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.909> pressing

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
look down here it tells us that pressing

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.480 
look down here it tells us that pressing
the<00:01:42.030> control<00:01:42.479> button<00:01:42.920> will<00:01:43.920> do<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.159> will<00:01:44.310> make

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
the control button will do it will make

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.620 
the control button will do it will make
it<00:01:44.840> scale<00:01:45.840> around<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.350> center<00:01:47.180> and<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.570> you

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
it scale around the center and so you

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.469 
it scale around the center and so you
can<00:01:48.899> just<00:01:49.049> pull<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.470> in<00:01:49.799> now<00:01:50.700> if<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:51.000> if<00:01:51.329> you

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
can just pull that in now if you if you

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.469 
can just pull that in now if you if you
look<00:01:51.630> at<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:51.990> it's<00:01:52.979> still<00:01:53.159> flat<00:01:53.640> on<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.939> top<00:01:54.180> so

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
look at it it's still flat on the top so

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.050 
look at it it's still flat on the top so
you<00:01:54.509> have<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.930> zoom<00:01:55.170> in<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.409> bit<00:01:55.530> more<00:01:55.909> click<00:01:56.909> on

the<00:02:03.659> center<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.890> just<00:02:05.130> keep<00:02:05.310> doing<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:06.229> one

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
the center and just keep doing that one

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.930 
the center and just keep doing that one
or<00:02:07.380> two<00:02:07.500> times<00:02:07.740> should<00:02:08.039> be<00:02:08.129> plenty<00:02:08.369> done<00:02:08.789> if

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
or two times should be plenty done if

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.729 
or two times should be plenty done if
you<00:02:09.060> zoom<00:02:09.300> back<00:02:09.330> out<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:09.959> can<00:02:10.170> see<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.590> it's

it's<00:02:12.790> quite<00:02:13.000> pointed<00:02:16.860> alright<00:02:18.600> um<00:02:19.600> and<00:02:20.590> that's

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
it's quite pointed alright um and that's

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.430 
it's quite pointed alright um and that's
another<00:02:21.100> way<00:02:21.310> none<00:02:21.550> the<00:02:22.000> difference<00:02:22.930> between

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
another way none the difference between

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.340 
another way none the difference between
these<00:02:23.590> two<00:02:23.830> methods<00:02:24.130> is<00:02:24.520> that<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:25.630> sir<00:02:25.870> the

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
these two methods is that the sir the

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.070 
these two methods is that the sir the
