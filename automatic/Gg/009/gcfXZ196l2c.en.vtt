get the red rubber bands if you want to
have<00:01:50.570> a<00:01:50.600> liberal<00:01:51.110> fashion<00:01:51.620> on<00:01:51.740> to<00:01:51.890> this<00:01:52.070> thing

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 
have a liberal fashion on to this thing

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.000 
have a liberal fashion on to this thing
so<00:01:52.970> I'm<00:01:53.030> just<00:01:53.150> going<00:01:53.270> to<00:01:53.360> zoom<00:01:53.630> out<00:01:53.780> so<00:01:54.080> i'll

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
so I'm just going to zoom out so i'll

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.820 
so I'm just going to zoom out so i'll
try<00:01:55.190> mounting<00:01:55.460> this<00:01:55.610> onto<00:01:55.970> my<00:01:56.090> camera<00:01:56.450> just

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
try mounting this onto my camera just

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.190 
try mounting this onto my camera just
simply<00:01:57.830> on<00:01:58.130> insert<00:01:58.820> this<00:01:59.030> in<00:01:59.360> to<00:01:59.690> the<00:01:59.810> magnet

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
simply on insert this in to the magnet

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
simply on insert this in to the magnet
and<00:02:01.100> the<00:02:01.160> reason<00:02:02.000> why<00:02:02.210> i<00:02:02.240> did<00:02:02.750> a<00:02:02.900> DIY<00:02:03.740> solution

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
and the reason why i did a DIY solution

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.180 
and the reason why i did a DIY solution
is<00:02:04.790> because<00:02:05.450> as<00:02:05.690> you<00:02:05.840> can<00:02:05.870> see<00:02:06.050> in<00:02:06.470> sixty

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
is because as you can see in sixty

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.040 
is because as you can see in sixty
decays<00:02:07.610> this<00:02:08.060> is<00:02:08.179> the<00:02:08.270> problem<00:02:08.479> once<00:02:08.899> you're

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
decays this is the problem once you're

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.980 
decays this is the problem once you're
trying<00:02:09.259> to<00:02:09.320> get<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.560> LCD<00:02:09.860> GF<00:02:10.100> out<00:02:10.369> or<00:02:10.700> anything

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
trying to get the LCD GF out or anything

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.080 
trying to get the LCD GF out or anything
this<00:02:11.990> is<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.230> problem<00:02:12.440> so<00:02:12.860> so<00:02:13.310> to<00:02:13.850> make<00:02:13.880> this

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
this is the problem so so to make this

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.620 
this is the problem so so to make this
really<00:02:14.330> tight<00:02:14.690> and<00:02:14.930> you<00:02:15.770> know<00:02:15.890> get<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.600> have<00:02:17.600> a

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
really tight and you know get the have a

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.420 
really tight and you know get the have a
solution<00:02:17.959> this<00:02:18.260> is<00:02:18.320> what<00:02:18.680> i<00:02:18.709> came<00:02:18.800> up<00:02:18.950> with<00:02:19.220> so

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
solution this is what i came up with so

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.480 
solution this is what i came up with so
just<00:02:19.640> get<00:02:20.000> stretched<00:02:20.450> over<00:02:20.720> ban<00:02:20.959> out<00:02:21.400> put<00:02:22.400> in

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
just get stretched over ban out put in

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.000 
just get stretched over ban out put in
the<00:02:22.610> grip<00:02:22.820> and<00:02:23.120> as<00:02:23.900> well<00:02:24.110> as<00:02:24.140> this<00:02:24.440> side<00:02:24.709> on

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
the grip and as well as this side on

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.900 
the grip and as well as this side on
here<00:02:25.870> like<00:02:26.870> so<00:02:27.110> then<00:02:27.950> you<00:02:28.070> go<00:02:28.220> it's<00:02:28.400> really

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
here like so then you go it's really

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.170 
here like so then you go it's really
really<00:02:29.090> sturdy<00:02:29.709> it's<00:02:30.709> not<00:02:30.830> gonna<00:02:31.070> twist<00:02:31.940> or

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
really sturdy it's not gonna twist or

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.330 
really sturdy it's not gonna twist or
anything<00:02:32.510> just<00:02:32.660> like<00:02:32.810> i<00:02:33.080> did<00:02:33.440> awhile<00:02:33.709> ago<00:02:33.890> or

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
anything just like i did awhile ago or

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.220 
anything just like i did awhile ago or
if<00:02:34.940> you<00:02:35.090> think<00:02:35.330> it's<00:02:35.480> not<00:02:35.630> sturdy<00:02:35.930> enough<00:02:36.050> you

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
if you think it's not sturdy enough you

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.890 
if you think it's not sturdy enough you
can<00:02:36.380> just<00:02:36.530> be<00:02:36.620> creative<00:02:36.980> on<00:02:37.520> what<00:02:38.120> you<00:02:38.270> do<00:02:38.420> you
