00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.520
 very good we must send how to make a 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.810
 fireball the first thing they have to 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.840
 to do is pull about 44 squares of 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:15.350
 toilet paper 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.570
 and they will roll them in their hand once 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.690
 rolled the toilet paper we're going to 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.580
 invest in water 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:25.810
 in water 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:30.070
 we're going to be a ball and they're going 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:33.850
 they are not going to crush well 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:36.160
 here is the ball can not see 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.850
 after that they will carry a little 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.090
 alcohol and they will wet you like the 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.090
 hole 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.510
 good in my first video that I'm going to do 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.870
 for you I hope you look and if you 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:00.489
 I like to continue doing more 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.489
 Once the ball is ready 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:06.900
 and the ball is where you can 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.900
 they want to learn 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.140
 let's see what the grandmother caught and 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:18.900
 this ball is moldable 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.900
 they will be able to pass from hand to hand 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.429
 without fear 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.799
 here is the ball the explanation of what 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:31.140
 What can I tell you is that they try 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.149
 green fire hole because the fire 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.000
 to this red because they are going to cause 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.979
 a maybe burn more the thing of 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.009
 alcohol is that when they put the ball the 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.259
 blue part is down and that part what 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.390
 that does not burn much just heats a 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.729
 little so this already easily not 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.149
 we will be able to learn look if not 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.149
 we can do 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.510
 if it still has alcohol left 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.640
 tomorrow he does not have alcohol left look what 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:01.620
 they can do again 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:07.880
 and if you want, you can throw it away 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:07.880
 to his friend in the face why 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:21.910
 It is the fireball 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:23.920
 everything healthy no longer has anything good I hope 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:29.220
 that you liked this is the first 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.220
 video the good population
