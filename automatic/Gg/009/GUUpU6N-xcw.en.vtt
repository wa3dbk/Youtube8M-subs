Lesser Antilles right in here we've got

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.120

the Greater Antilles in this area right

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.210 
the Greater Antilles in this area right
now<00:01:06.400> we<00:01:06.460> have<00:01:06.820> top<00:01:07.090> sustained<00:01:07.570> winds<00:01:08.020> of<00:01:08.220> 135

now we have top sustained winds of 135

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.460 
now we have top sustained winds of 135
miles<00:01:09.760> now<00:01:10.060> it<00:01:10.330> is<00:01:10.570> moving<00:01:11.140> to<00:01:11.320> the<00:01:11.350> west

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
miles now it is moving to the west

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.060 
miles now it is moving to the west
northwest<00:01:12.130> at<00:01:12.640> about<00:01:13.390> 18<00:01:14.110> miles<00:01:14.350> per<00:01:14.680> hour<00:01:14.830> it

northwest at about 18 miles per hour it

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.260 
northwest at about 18 miles per hour it
is<00:01:15.159> chugging<00:01:15.580> along<00:01:15.670> so<00:01:15.970> it's<00:01:16.090> actually

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
is chugging along so it's actually

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.609 
is chugging along so it's actually
gained<00:01:16.600> a<00:01:16.720> little<00:01:16.810> bit<00:01:16.960> of<00:01:17.110> forward<00:01:17.350> momentum

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
gained a little bit of forward momentum

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.310 
gained a little bit of forward momentum
here<00:01:18.340> and<00:01:18.520> as<00:01:19.210> you<00:01:19.360> can<00:01:19.479> see<00:01:19.540> this<00:01:19.810> is<00:01:19.990> a<00:01:20.020> very

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
here and as you can see this is a very

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.770 
here and as you can see this is a very
large<00:01:20.860> hurricane<00:01:21.250> but<00:01:21.729> the<00:01:21.880> good<00:01:22.090> news<00:01:22.270> is<00:01:22.570> as

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
large hurricane but the good news is as

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.450 
large hurricane but the good news is as
we<00:01:22.900> look<00:01:23.080> toward<00:01:23.320> the<00:01:23.439> Lesser<00:01:23.830> Antilles<00:01:23.860> from

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
we look toward the Lesser Antilles from

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.880 
we look toward the Lesser Antilles from
the<00:01:24.549> Greater<00:01:24.790> Antilles<00:01:25.229> this<00:01:26.229> system<00:01:26.710> is

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
the Greater Antilles this system is

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.430 
the Greater Antilles this system is
going<00:01:27.159> to<00:01:27.430> move<00:01:27.640> north<00:01:28.180> of<00:01:28.480> these<00:01:28.660> areas<00:01:29.170> now

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
going to move north of these areas now

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.620 
going to move north of these areas now
of<00:01:29.560> course<00:01:29.740> the<00:01:29.980> next<00:01:30.280> concern<00:01:30.730> is<00:01:31.030> we're

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
of course the next concern is we're

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.150 
of course the next concern is we're
going<00:01:31.780> to<00:01:31.870> wait<00:01:32.110> and<00:01:32.290> watch<00:01:32.440> where<00:01:32.800> it's<00:01:32.920> going

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
going to wait and watch where it's going

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.040 
going to wait and watch where it's going
down<00:01:33.310> now<00:01:33.340> here's<00:01:33.790> Bermuda<00:01:34.390> certainly<00:01:34.960> an

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
down now here's Bermuda certainly an

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.810 
down now here's Bermuda certainly an
area<00:01:35.170> that<00:01:35.440> watches<00:01:35.920> what<00:01:36.070> happens<00:01:36.460> when<00:01:36.670> it

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
area that watches what happens when it

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.940 
area that watches what happens when it
comes<00:01:37.330> to<00:01:37.570> hurricanes<00:01:38.140> and<00:01:38.440> then<00:01:38.590> of<00:01:38.680> course

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
comes to hurricanes and then of course

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.640 
comes to hurricanes and then of course
the<00:01:39.190> US<00:01:39.550> so<00:01:40.180> what<00:01:40.450> is<00:01:40.659> going<00:01:40.930> to<00:01:41.050> happen<00:01:41.530> as

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
the US so what is going to happen as

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.530 
the US so what is going to happen as
this<00:01:41.800> system<00:01:42.070> is<00:01:42.400> actually<00:01:42.790> going<00:01:43.000> to<00:01:43.210> swing

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
this system is actually going to swing

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.260 
this system is actually going to swing
right<00:01:44.409> on<00:01:44.590> through<00:01:44.950> this<00:01:45.190> area<00:01:45.520> it<00:01:45.640> looks<00:01:45.670> like

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
right on through this area it looks like

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.470 
right on through this area it looks like
right<00:01:46.690> in<00:01:46.960> between<00:01:47.430> Bermuda<00:01:48.430> in<00:01:48.700> the<00:01:48.820> US<00:01:49.150> but

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:49.480 
right in between Bermuda in the US but

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.090 
right in between Bermuda in the US but
this<00:01:49.630> is<00:01:49.840> still<00:01:50.080> really<00:01:50.110> going<00:01:50.590> to<00:01:50.680> kick<00:01:50.920> up

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
this is still really going to kick up

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.940 
this is still really going to kick up
the<00:01:51.280> surf<00:01:51.550> here<00:01:51.909> along<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:52.810> eastern<00:01:53.200> seaboard

the surf here along the eastern seaboard
the<00:01:54.159> very<00:01:54.550> dangerous<00:01:54.850> rip<00:01:55.330> currents<00:01:55.720> so<00:01:55.990> if

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170

conditions<00:02:01.810> here<00:02:02.110> those<00:02:02.320> waves<00:02:02.620> are<00:02:02.860> really

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
conditions here those waves are really

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.920 
conditions here those waves are really
going<00:02:03.220> to<00:02:03.310> be<00:02:03.370> kicking<00:02:03.610> up<00:02:03.820> even<00:02:04.540> for<00:02:04.720> folks

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
to the coast you don't want a big wave

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.589 
to the coast you don't want a big wave
to<00:02:11.170> come<00:02:11.200> along<00:02:11.650> and<00:02:11.920> actually<00:02:12.700> push<00:02:13.030> you<00:02:13.269> out

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
to sea now what we have steering this is

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.520 
to sea now what we have steering this is
right<00:02:16.659> now<00:02:16.840> it's<00:02:17.049> going<00:02:17.230> to<00:02:17.290> be<00:02:17.349> moving

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
right now it's going to be moving

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.309 
right now it's going to be moving
between<00:02:17.860> two<00:02:18.340> areas<00:02:18.730> of<00:02:18.849> high<00:02:19.090> pressure<00:02:19.319> then

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
between two areas of high pressure then

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.050 
between two areas of high pressure then
as<00:02:20.470> it<00:02:20.590> gets<00:02:20.709> closer<00:02:21.010> to<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.430> US<00:02:21.549> Coast<00:02:21.849> we're

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
as it gets closer to the US Coast we're

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.580 
as it gets closer to the US Coast we're
going<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.239> have<00:02:22.360> a<00:02:22.390> trough<00:02:22.840> coming<00:02:23.200> through

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
going to have a trough coming through

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.710 
going to have a trough coming through
here<00:02:23.860> that<00:02:24.340> trough<00:02:24.610> is<00:02:24.819> first<00:02:25.090> going<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.510> turn

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
here that trough is first going to turn

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.170 
here that trough is first going to turn
it<00:02:25.840> to<00:02:25.989> the<00:02:26.140> north<00:02:26.379> and<00:02:26.709> then<00:02:27.159> eventually<00:02:27.670> it's

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
it to the north and then eventually it's

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.149 
it to the north and then eventually it's
going<00:02:28.390> to<00:02:28.450> be<00:02:28.540> moving<00:02:28.690> it<00:02:29.019> to<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.290> Northeast

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:30.159 
going to be moving it to the Northeast

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:32.640 
going to be moving it to the Northeast

now to the west of Bermuda sweeping up

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.600 
now to the west of Bermuda sweeping up
along<00:02:41.750> the<00:02:41.990> eastern<00:02:42.410> seaboard<00:02:42.740> and<00:02:43.160> while<00:02:43.430> we

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
along the eastern seaboard and while we

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.340 
along the eastern seaboard and while we
will<00:02:43.820> certainly<00:02:44.090> be<00:02:44.270> watching<00:02:44.570> yours<00:02:45.080> like

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
will certainly be watching yours like

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.050 
will certainly be watching yours like
hip<00:02:45.590> cog<00:02:45.890> closely<00:02:46.520> in<00:02:46.610> the<00:02:46.700> days<00:02:46.850> to<00:02:47.030> come

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
hip cog closely in the days to come

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.510 
hip cog closely in the days to come
right<00:02:47.930> now<00:02:47.960> it<00:02:48.380> does<00:02:48.620> look<00:02:48.920> like<00:02:49.100> it's<00:02:49.310> going

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
to be moving east of the US and then

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.760 
to be moving east of the US and then
continue<00:02:52.670> on<00:02:52.700> that<00:02:53.090> path<00:02:53.150> away<00:02:53.870> from<00:02:54.680> the

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
continue on that path away from the
