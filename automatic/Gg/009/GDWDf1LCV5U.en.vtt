producer<00:00:15.900> Lynette<00:00:16.260> here<00:00:16.650> she<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:16.830> now<00:00:17.160> Lynette

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
producer Lynette here she is now Lynette

is in the process of losing weight she's

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.519 
is in the process of losing weight she's
already<00:00:20.580> dropped<00:00:21.060> 40<00:00:21.600> pounds<00:00:22.170> well<00:00:22.320> done

already dropped 40 pounds well done

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.859 
already dropped 40 pounds well done
Lynette<00:00:22.890> but<00:00:23.460> what<00:00:23.730> would<00:00:23.939> she<00:00:24.090> look<00:00:24.330> like<00:00:24.570> if

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
Lynette but what would she look like if

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.560 
Lynette but what would she look like if
she<00:00:25.320> started<00:00:25.800> taking<00:00:26.070> bail<00:00:26.580> Vick<00:00:26.910> well

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
she started taking bail Vick well

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.300 
she started taking bail Vick well
according<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.199> makers<00:00:28.349> folks<00:00:28.830> who<00:00:29.070> took

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
according to the makers folks who took

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.849 
according to the makers folks who took
the<00:00:29.519> pill<00:00:29.699> lost<00:00:29.970> nearly<00:00:30.269> 4<00:00:30.720> percent<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.529> their

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
the pill lost nearly 4 percent of their

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.310 
the pill lost nearly 4 percent of their
body<00:00:32.219> weight<00:00:32.369> so<00:00:33.090> this<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:33.809> what<00:00:34.050> Lynette

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
body weight so this is what Lynette

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.380 
body weight so this is what Lynette
would<00:00:34.469> look<00:00:34.620> like<00:00:34.800> if<00:00:35.010> she<00:00:35.370> lost<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.969> much

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
would look like if she lost that much

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.090 
would look like if she lost that much
but<00:00:36.840> here's<00:00:37.020> where<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.200> really<00:00:37.500> starts<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:37.950> get

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
but here's where it really starts to get

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.770 
but here's where it really starts to get
interesting<00:00:38.340> because<00:00:38.610> some<00:00:39.149> people<00:00:39.480> lost

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
interesting because some people lost

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.369 
interesting because some people lost
more<00:00:40.320> we're<00:00:40.950> talking<00:00:41.280> up<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.719> 5%<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:43.230> here's

more we're talking up to 5% and here's

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.630 
more we're talking up to 5% and here's
what<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.620> net<00:00:43.770> would<00:00:43.920> look<00:00:44.100> like<00:00:44.219> if<00:00:44.430> she<00:00:44.550> lost

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
what the net would look like if she lost

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.760

simply put it causes your brain to think
that<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.659> are<00:01:27.689> full<00:01:28.140> before<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:29.310> otherwise

because it was concerned about this well

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.550 
because it was concerned about this well
it<00:02:30.310> turns<00:02:30.760> out<00:02:31.000> that<00:02:31.240> the<00:02:31.420> risks<00:02:31.750> of<00:02:31.870> heart

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560

can get a good amount of weight loss you

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.860 
can get a good amount of weight loss you
had<00:02:38.500> mentioned<00:02:38.650> earlier<00:02:38.860> 5%<00:02:39.850> after<00:02:40.270> one<00:02:40.480> year

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
had mentioned earlier 5% after one year

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.990 
had mentioned earlier 5% after one year
I<00:02:41.050> mean<00:02:41.530> it's<00:02:41.680> not<00:02:41.770> a<00:02:41.830> magic<00:02:42.250> pill<00:02:42.280> this<00:02:42.700> isn't

the answer to all people who are

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.550 
the answer to all people who are
overweight<00:02:45.130> dreams<00:02:45.730> but<00:02:46.300> it's<00:02:46.420> a<00:02:46.510> definite<00:02:47.050> it

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
has its place between die and exercise

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.420 
has its place between die and exercise
which<00:02:49.780> is<00:02:49.900> the<00:02:50.020> best<00:02:50.530> way<00:02:50.710> to<00:02:50.740> lose<00:02:50.980> weight<00:02:51.010> and

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
surgery which can be very effective but

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.740 
surgery which can be very effective but
obviously<00:02:54.460> a<00:02:54.550> surgery<00:02:55.030> and<00:02:55.270> what<00:02:55.600> are<00:02:55.660> we

obviously a surgery and what are we

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.270 
obviously a surgery and what are we
looking<00:02:56.020> at<00:02:56.080> in<00:02:56.170> terms<00:02:56.200> of<00:02:56.440> cost<00:02:56.770> for<00:02:57.100> this

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
looking at in terms of cost for this

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.000

interesting thing is one of the people

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.600

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.520 
the cost of a starbucks venti latte per

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
pill so it's not that expensive

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.680
