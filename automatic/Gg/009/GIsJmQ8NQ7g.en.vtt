 gunshots 4 that bulb 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.040
 but certainly ucla screw this match 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.810
 the outcome is that she is five 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.490
 against a vivos and tom tries either 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.120
 knight tommy and just get some number 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.890

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.960
 no person is between video if you are the 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.820
 tommy or tons further to get on 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.080
 The motor simone pack number is sure 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.250
 I would be pretty special, so I go 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.140
 collapse in the market in a smaller way 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.910

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.870
 dutch great players you just got it there 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.220
 also to do with the clear 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.750
 coaching of marinus dijkhuizen 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.580
 if you sponges the east new king 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.930

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.800

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.940
 you make it a lot nicer 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.560
 so let it snap react wind and breeze 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.480
 rain like here on the enemy live in a 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.590
