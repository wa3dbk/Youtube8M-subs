 Normally when we take pictures with

 our phone if you do not have a micro 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.040
 If this is stored unimpeded by the 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.620
 gallery in the camera here we can see 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.630
 that we have 6 photos on the camera and 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.680
 we can see the little picture as the 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:15.590
 cellular while here is another one 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.110
 folder that is 15 but has a 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.910
 symbol of the excellent micro then 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.460
 here we have some albums that have 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.680
 photos in the micro usb and others that have 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.880
 photos on the camera if we want to save 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.950
 space on the phone and have more 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.680
 space on the phone take these photos 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.450
 or videos and pass them to the micro sd what 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.030
 let's do the following what 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.250
 we do with the gallery there are times in the 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.229
 which can be done but in this case 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.540
 on this phone and in this version of the 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.100
 android that we have is the does not come out the 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.020
 option to move 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.580
 and then what we do is enter 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.150
 by the file manager 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.850
 here are file manager let's go here 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.930
 the action manager gives me two options 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.570
 visualize what I have the local part 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.340
 the phone and what I have a card 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.280
 then what we are going to do is 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.479
 move from the local part of the file to 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.590
 photos that is the file of s &amp; m 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:13.640
 we need the camera file 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.500
 has six photos here are the photos 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.769
 that we have on the phone and what 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.350
 we want to do is move the wings my 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:24.590
 cross and the only way to do it is that 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.080
 copying these files and then pasting 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.720
 find them a folder in the micro sd and 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.060
 then return them, returning us here to 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.170
 local and deleting the then for 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.270
 copy these files 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.790

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.430
 these six elements here in this option 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.720
 of pasting and canceling I'm going to stay with 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.230
 the one to paste that I'm going to use more 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:55.080
 forward I return income to the 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.890
 cd card then go to option 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.660
 of smm from the camera but on the card 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.670
 sd 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.570
 here what I can do is create this 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.890
 folder but I'm going to keep the camera 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.530
 let's create another folder rather more 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.960
 easy here we click on the option and 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:17.350
 down here where it says new folder 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:20.260
 we can put pictures 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.680
 that were on the phone pictures 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.680
 phone 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.610
 save 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.480
 and right now click here return 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:33.360
 to this folder and I hit 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.330
 these pictures quickly stuck now 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.310
 simply enough to return to the local 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.129
 in the came through this folder 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.379
 enter here this local folder and 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:45.670
 delete all these photos that you just finished 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:48.690
 stick to the other side 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.420
 and ready that way what I've done is 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.680
 move the files from one side to the other 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.230
 copying and pasting and then deleting 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.459
