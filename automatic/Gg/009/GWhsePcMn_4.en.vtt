today<00:00:02.310> we're<00:00:02.550> going<00:00:02.730> to<00:00:02.850> fill<00:00:03.720> a<00:00:03.750> couple<00:00:04.080> of

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
today we're going to fill a couple of

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.220 
today we're going to fill a couple of
holes<00:00:04.380> in<00:00:04.650> a<00:00:05.040> hollow<00:00:05.279> air<00:00:05.580> ring<00:00:05.790> and<00:00:06.540> we're

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
holes in a hollow air ring and we're

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.680 
holes in a hollow air ring and we're
using<00:00:07.470> extremely<00:00:08.130> thin<00:00:08.550> wire<00:00:08.820> here<00:00:09.179> this<00:00:09.510> is

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
using extremely thin wire here this is

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:16.129 
using extremely thin wire here this is
point<00:00:09.929> zero<00:00:10.139> zero<00:00:10.200> five<00:00:10.559> inch<00:00:14.929> the<00:00:15.929> first

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
point zero zero five inch the first

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.240 
point zero zero five inch the first
thing<00:00:16.289> we're<00:00:16.410> going<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:16.560> do<00:00:16.710> is<00:00:16.859> make<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.070> little

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
thing we're going to do is make a little

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.590 
thing we're going to do is make a little
ball<00:00:17.460> on<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.820> end<00:00:17.880> of<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.119> wire<00:00:20.300> attach<00:00:21.300> that

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
ball on the end of the wire attach that

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.179 
ball on the end of the wire attach that
ball<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.020> we<00:00:22.109> have<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.350> do<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:22.590> at<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.769> proper

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
ball and we have to do it at the proper

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:47.180 
ball and we have to do it at the proper
angles

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.580 

get<00:00:47.790> it<00:00:47.910> all<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.150> flow<00:00:48.390> together

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:01:20.280 

needs<00:00:52.130> a<00:00:52.250> little<00:00:52.400> more

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.710 

there<00:01:20.950> we<00:01:21.040> go<00:01:21.160> you<00:01:22.030> know<00:01:22.120> one<00:01:22.330> of<00:01:22.360> the<00:01:22.510> holes

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
there we go you know one of the holes

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.290 
there we go you know one of the holes
filled<00:01:23.080> this<00:01:24.040> one's<00:01:24.310> a<00:01:24.430> little<00:01:24.550> bigger<00:01:24.820> so<00:01:25.270> I

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
filled this one's a little bigger so I

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:40.899 
filled this one's a little bigger so I
might<00:01:25.600> take<00:01:26.200> a<00:01:26.260> couple<00:01:26.590> of<00:01:26.770> little<00:01:27.460> balls

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:46.200 

we're<00:01:41.450> using<00:01:41.860> extremely<00:01:43.540> fast<00:01:44.540> Hertz<00:01:44.960> here

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
we're using extremely fast Hertz here

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.640 
we're using extremely fast Hertz here
it's<00:01:47.210> going<00:01:47.390> to<00:01:47.450> bring<00:01:47.600> down<00:01:47.840> our<00:01:47.900> peak<00:01:48.350> pulse

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
it's going to bring down our peak pulse

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:54.100 
it's going to bring down our peak pulse
power<00:01:50.440> so<00:01:51.440> we<00:01:51.650> don't<00:01:51.860> pulse<00:01:52.549> more<00:01:53.000> or<00:01:53.479> pop<00:01:53.869> more

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
power so we don't pulse more or pop more

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:10.169 
power so we don't pulse more or pop more
holes<00:01:54.350> into<00:01:54.860> our<00:01:55.009> work

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:22.220 

a<00:02:10.269> little<00:02:10.899> bit<00:02:11.079> more<00:02:11.319> right<00:02:11.530> in<00:02:11.769> here

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.930 

have<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:22.950> use<00:02:22.980> different<00:02:23.310> angles<00:02:25.790> when<00:02:26.790> we're

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
have to use different angles when we're

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.970 
have to use different angles when we're
finished<00:02:27.360> we're<00:02:27.630> going<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:28.260> hit<00:02:28.710> it<00:02:28.830> with<00:02:28.920> a

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
finished we're going to hit it with a

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.590 
finished we're going to hit it with a
marker<00:02:29.490> and<00:02:31.760> we're<00:02:32.760> going<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:32.910> homogenize<00:02:33.180> it

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
marker and we're going to homogenize it

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:44.330 
marker and we're going to homogenize it
all<00:02:33.990> together

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:53.500 

a<00:02:44.370> couple<00:02:45.360> more<00:02:45.540> places<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:46.170> fill

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.080 

now<00:02:54.510> once<00:02:54.720> it's<00:02:54.900> homogenized<00:02:55.740> if<00:02:56.070> I<00:02:56.370> see<00:02:56.760> any

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
now once it's homogenized if I see any

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.120 
now once it's homogenized if I see any
more<00:02:57.720> pinholes<00:02:58.470> or<00:02:58.800> such<00:03:00.650> I'm<00:03:01.650> just<00:03:01.950> going<00:03:02.100> to

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
more pinholes or such I'm just going to

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:14.350 
more pinholes or such I'm just going to
fill<00:03:02.370> those<00:03:02.550> in<00:03:02.610> as<00:03:03.060> well

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.259 

okay

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.550 

we're<00:03:18.269> going<00:03:18.390> to<00:03:18.450> take<00:03:18.659> out<00:03:18.840> our<00:03:18.870> trusty

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
we're going to take out our trusty

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.830 
we're going to take out our trusty
marker<00:03:21.290> and<00:03:22.290> mark<00:03:22.650> it<00:03:22.829> first

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.949 

marking<00:03:26.830> just<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.370> high<00:03:27.550> points

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.680 

and<00:03:32.959> if<00:03:33.650> we<00:03:33.890> don't<00:03:34.099> get<00:03:34.370> good<00:03:34.690> homogenizing

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
and if we don't get good homogenizing

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.320 
and if we don't get good homogenizing
well<00:03:36.260> then<00:03:36.590> we're<00:03:36.920> going<00:03:37.220> to<00:03:37.340> read<00:03:37.519> you<00:03:37.819> know<00:03:37.940> I

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
well then we're going to read you know I

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:51.270 
well then we're going to read you know I
think<00:03:38.840> rethink<00:03:39.830> our<00:03:39.950> settings

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:58.970 

we<00:03:51.790> got<00:03:52.000> some<00:03:52.270> flow<00:03:52.630> there

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.929 

but<00:03:59.980> I'm<00:04:00.099> going<00:04:00.250> to<00:04:00.280> juice<00:04:00.459> it<00:04:00.670> up<00:04:00.760> a<00:04:00.849> little

00:04:00.929 --> 00:04:00.939 
but I'm going to juice it up a little

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:04.559

bit<00:04:02.159> we<00:04:03.159> want<00:04:03.310> all<00:04:03.489> of<00:04:03.519> this<00:04:03.790> to<00:04:03.849> come<00:04:04.299> together

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
bit we want all of this to come together

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:25.960 
bit we want all of this to come together
as<00:04:04.989> one<00:04:05.260> piece<00:04:07.019> we<00:04:08.019> mark<00:04:08.260> it

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:34.270 

starting<00:04:26.900> the<00:04:27.020> floor

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.090 

okay<00:04:34.910> we<00:04:35.360> have<00:04:35.480> a<00:04:35.510> few<00:04:35.810> tiny<00:04:36.350> little<00:04:36.710> pinholes

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
okay we have a few tiny little pinholes

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.310 
okay we have a few tiny little pinholes
we're<00:04:37.370> going<00:04:37.520> to<00:04:37.580> fill<00:04:37.930> and<00:04:38.930> we're<00:04:39.170> going<00:04:39.290> to

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
we're going to fill and we're going to

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:45.870 
we're going to fill and we're going to
modernize<00:04:39.860> again

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:05:13.170 

here's<00:04:46.510> one<00:04:46.780> right<00:04:47.080> in<00:04:47.410> here

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180

okay<00:05:29.330> if<00:05:29.420> you<00:05:29.570> were<00:05:29.690> wondering<00:05:30.020> about<00:05:30.080> this

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
okay if you were wondering about this

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.170 
okay if you were wondering about this
piece<00:05:30.680> here<00:05:31.010> there<00:05:31.250> were<00:05:31.370> looks<00:05:31.730> like<00:05:31.940> there's

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
piece here there were looks like there's

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.310 
piece here there were looks like there's
a<00:05:33.160> little<00:05:34.160> bit<00:05:34.310> of<00:05:34.550> material<00:05:35.480> that<00:05:35.690> might<00:05:36.140> have

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 
a little bit of material that might have

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.250 
a little bit of material that might have
popped<00:05:36.470> out<00:05:36.740> I<00:05:36.770> didn't<00:05:37.190> earlier<00:05:37.790> time<00:05:38.260> this

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
popped out I didn't earlier time this

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.590 
popped out I didn't earlier time this
hammer<00:05:39.530> that<00:05:39.800> down<00:05:40.040> a<00:05:40.070> little<00:05:40.220> bit<00:05:40.580> there<00:05:41.480> we

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 
hammer that down a little bit there we

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.030 
hammer that down a little bit there we
go<00:05:41.920> okay<00:05:42.950> now<00:05:43.220> we're<00:05:43.370> gonna<00:05:44.650> change<00:05:45.650> up<00:05:45.860> our

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.040 
go okay now we're gonna change up our
