00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:09.990
 today in how it is done we are going to prepare the 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.750
 nut sauce this sauce is a real 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.809
 classic a basic that we should know for 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.360
 because it is so important in dishes 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:23.370
 of fish as of vegetables we need 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.570
 salt butter flour onion pepper 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.600
 nutmeg 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.730
 in my case it's going to be vegetable broth 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.759
 but it can also be done with broth 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.310
 fish are the same procedures 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:37.520
 let's proceed to make the recipe what 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:41.670
 first thing we will do is in a casserole 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:44.100
 we will put our butter to melt 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.140
 the yarn quantities of the 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.570
 ingredients are at the end once 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.650
 melted let's add our onion 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.650
 very finely chopped 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.560
 we will do this at medium heat so that 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.510
 do not burn us but we do face 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.579
 it tells me that it is the point that we have to 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.409
 search for 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:06.670
 seasoning we will do well so that our 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:09.670
 vegetable sweat and throw all the water and 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.770
 caramelize little by little we will add 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.049
 species a little bit of pepper and a 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.689
 little bit of nutmeg that's good 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:18.130
 of the consumer but we will continue 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:20.320
 stirring from time to time until 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.130
 caramelize well once it's okay 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:27.610
 rehogada we add our flour 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:30.159
 to sautÃ© on a very low heat so that 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.590
 do not burn us, we'll add some 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:35.200
 a few spoonfuls of the amount that 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.730
 we have to use, we will go moving 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.330
 little by little 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:43.590
 so that it does not burn and do not burn 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.590
 for then raw flour 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.720
 we are doing it little by little adding 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.079
 little by little so that we do not stay 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.079
 lumps 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.260
 Once it has compacted, turn off the 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.600
 fire and we add little by little our 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.090
 broth of vegetable in this case or our 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.009
 fish stock and we move well with the 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.320
 fire off so that it does not burn and 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.930
 do not make lumps move well until 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.209
 that is dissolving that we go 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.480
 making a cream and we keep adding 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.690
 the broth little by little 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.090
 and so you will see how there are no lumps there 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.470
 the secret with him with the fire off 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.409
 once 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:32.360
 once it is well dissolved we upload the 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:32.360
 fire and bring it to a boil 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.450
 when it starts to boil we lower the fire 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:40.909
 at medium low heat and let it boil 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.060
 until until that sauce begins 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:45.920
 bind and thicken once already bound and is 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.500
 heavy we have our sauce for 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.540
 gratin our fish dishes and 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.650
 vegetable there you have the ingredients os 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.650
 I wait in new recipes
