didn't really want to put it up but I

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.950 
didn't really want to put it up but I
didn't<00:00:22.890> ask<00:00:23.010> about<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.550> while<00:00:23.760> ago<00:00:23.960> and

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
people are like you wonder what she

people are like you wonder what she
fails<00:00:26.930> basically<00:00:27.930> this<00:00:28.109> videos<00:00:28.500> all<00:00:29.310> about<00:00:29.369> me

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
fails basically this videos all about me

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.720 
fails basically this videos all about me
trying<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.599> teach<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:30.990> how<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.380> do<00:00:31.730> stamping

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
trying to teach you how to do stamping

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.000 
trying to teach you how to do stamping
but<00:00:33.090> stamping<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.020> thing<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.350> suck<00:00:34.620> at<00:00:34.800> most

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
but stamping is the thing I suck at most

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.500 
but stamping is the thing I suck at most
in<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.309> world<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:35.670> cannot<00:00:35.940> do<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.300> for<00:00:36.360> the

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
in the world and I cannot do it for the

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.080 
in the world and I cannot do it for the
life<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.870> me<00:00:37.079> basically<00:00:37.649> I've<00:00:37.860> tried<00:00:38.340> stamping

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
life of me basically I've tried stamping

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.299 
life of me basically I've tried stamping
with<00:00:39.210> these<00:00:39.390> twice<00:00:39.750> now<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.200> first<00:00:40.590> time<00:00:40.950> it

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
with these twice now the first time it

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.600 
with these twice now the first time it
was<00:00:41.399> just<00:00:41.550> like<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.700> complete<00:00:42.059> failure<00:00:43.610> maybe

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
was just like a complete failure maybe

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.860 
was just like a complete failure maybe
part<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.000> problem<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.539> my<00:00:45.629> nails

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
part of the problem is that my nails

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.959 
part of the problem is that my nails
really<00:00:46.289> really<00:00:46.469> wide<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.640> means<00:00:47.820> that

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
really really wide and it means that

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.700 
really really wide and it means that
most<00:00:48.239> em<00:00:48.660> it's<00:00:48.989> like<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.170> actual<00:00:49.379> stepping

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
most em it's like the actual stepping

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.889 
most em it's like the actual stepping
plate<00:00:49.920> part<00:00:50.219> itself<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.700> too<00:00:50.910> small<00:00:51.270> so

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
plate part itself is too small so

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:52.910 
plate part itself is too small so
therefore<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.170> can't<00:00:52.379> get<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.559> whole<00:00:52.649> pattern

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
therefore I can't get the whole pattern

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.010 
therefore I can't get the whole pattern
transferred<00:00:53.399> but<00:00:54.270> also<00:00:54.420> you'll<00:00:54.629> see<00:00:54.660> for<00:00:54.960> the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
transferred but also you'll see for the

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.740 
transferred but also you'll see for the
second<00:00:55.410> part<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.800> this<00:00:55.920> video<00:00:56.129> thing<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.940> that

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
second part of this video thing and that

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.040 
second part of this video thing and that
I<00:00:57.780> used<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.559> big<00:00:59.010> design<00:00:59.370> on<00:01:00.300> these<00:01:00.510> not<00:01:00.809> small

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
I used a big design on these not small

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.689 
I used a big design on these not small
one<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.949> should<00:01:02.160> have<00:01:02.250> worked

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
one so it should have worked

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.789 
one so it should have worked
but<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.390> didn't<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:03.989> think<00:01:04.290> there's<00:01:04.470> partly

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
but it didn't I think there's partly

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.200 
but it didn't I think there's partly
because<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.339> stamping<00:01:05.729> polishes<00:01:06.119> I'm

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
because the stamping polishes I'm

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.850 
because the stamping polishes I'm
reviewing<00:01:06.420> from<00:01:06.659> born<00:01:06.900> pretty<00:01:06.930> store<00:01:07.170> they

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
reviewing from born pretty store they

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.250 
reviewing from born pretty store they
dry<00:01:08.220> really<00:01:08.820> really<00:01:09.060> fast<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.630> don't<00:01:09.750> anytime

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
dry really really fast you don't anytime

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.590 
dry really really fast you don't anytime
to<00:01:10.409> transfer<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.010> your<00:01:11.130> nail<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.610> maybe<00:01:12.390> if

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
to transfer it to your nail and maybe if

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.969 
to transfer it to your nail and maybe if
you<00:01:12.689> weren't<00:01:12.869> filming<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.650> trying<00:01:13.920> to

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
you weren't filming it and trying to

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.999 
you weren't filming it and trying to
finger<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.880> camera<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.600> stuff<00:01:15.869> might<00:01:16.860> be

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
finger a camera and stuff might be

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.249 
finger a camera and stuff might be
easier<00:01:17.490> but<00:01:18.119> table<00:01:18.570> i'm<00:01:18.689> leavin'<00:01:18.930> touched<00:01:19.080> me

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
easier but table i'm leavin' touched me

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.260 
easier but table i'm leavin' touched me
sings<00:01:19.500> again<00:01:19.619> this<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.729> proof<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.119> my

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
sings again this is proof that my

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.719 
sings again this is proof that my
reviews<00:01:21.600> aren't<00:01:21.840> biased<00:01:22.439> at<00:01:22.650> all<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:23.100> had<00:01:23.520> used

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
reviews aren't biased at all I had used

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.609 
reviews aren't biased at all I had used
Cohn<00:01:24.030> aired<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.390> past<00:01:24.630> just<00:01:24.960> once<00:01:25.259> as<00:01:25.500> my

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
Cohn aired in the past just once as my

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.590 
Cohn aired in the past just once as my
friends<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.189> that<00:01:26.820> was<00:01:26.970> great<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.450> worked

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
friends and that was great and it worked

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.240 
friends and that was great and it worked
really<00:01:27.780> really<00:01:27.869> well<00:01:28.049> so<00:01:28.590> I'm<00:01:28.650> not<00:01:28.799> sure<00:01:28.860> if<00:01:29.130> as

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
really really well so I'm not sure if as

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.030 
really really well so I'm not sure if as
a<00:01:29.340> one-off<00:01:29.520> or<00:01:29.880> what<00:01:30.420> but<00:01:30.840> if<00:01:31.590> it's<00:01:31.799> just

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
a one-off or what but if it's just

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.310 
a one-off or what but if it's just
brands<00:01:32.700> let<00:01:32.970> me<00:01:33.150> know<00:01:33.299> this<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.869> kind<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.110> more

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
despite its failed nurse I will probably

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.620 
despite its failed nurse I will probably
just<00:01:44.670> like<00:01:44.939> this<00:01:45.090> myself

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
just like this myself

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.630 
just like this myself
so<00:01:45.840> none<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.590> things<00:01:46.740> taken<00:01:47.070> here<00:01:47.280> for<00:01:47.460> video

better<00:03:06.319> and<00:03:06.850> now<00:03:07.850> I'm<00:03:08.030> just<00:03:08.209> doing<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:08.480> same

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
better and now I'm just doing the same

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.690 
better and now I'm just doing the same
thing<00:03:08.690> for<00:03:08.959> the<00:03:09.260> rest<00:03:09.380> of<00:03:09.530> the<00:03:09.590> nails<00:03:09.769> I<00:03:10.130> found

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
thing for the rest of the nails I found

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.039 
thing for the rest of the nails I found
the<00:03:10.760> consistency<00:03:11.329> is<00:03:11.390> clean<00:03:11.570> the<00:03:11.660> polish<00:03:11.930> is

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
the consistency is clean the polish is

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:13.660 
the consistency is clean the polish is
quite<00:03:12.260> annoying<00:03:12.530> because<00:03:12.950> some<00:03:13.250> were<00:03:13.430> quite

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
quite annoying because some were quite

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.699 
quite annoying because some were quite
thin<00:03:13.970> and<00:03:14.180> some<00:03:14.359> were<00:03:14.510> quite<00:03:14.750> a<00:03:14.780> thick<00:03:15.079> and<00:03:15.260> so

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
thin and some were quite a thick and so

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.170 
thin and some were quite a thick and so
you<00:03:15.769> didn't<00:03:15.980> really<00:03:16.130> know<00:03:16.280> how<00:03:16.519> long<00:03:16.760> you<00:03:16.970> had

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
you didn't really know how long you had

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.150 
you didn't really know how long you had
for<00:03:17.420> them<00:03:17.510> to<00:03:17.630> dry<00:03:17.870> but<00:03:18.500> either<00:03:18.620> way<00:03:18.859> the<00:03:19.010> black

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
for them to dry but either way the black

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:25.370 
for them to dry but either way the black
works<00:03:19.459> a<00:03:19.579> lot<00:03:19.730> better<00:03:19.970> than<00:03:20.120> the<00:03:20.239> red

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.530 

however<00:03:26.100> my<00:03:26.250> nails<00:03:26.550> were<00:03:26.730> far<00:03:27.000> too<00:03:27.240> wide<00:03:27.510> so

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
however my nails were far too wide so

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.600 
however my nails were far too wide so
I'll<00:03:28.110> show<00:03:28.380> you<00:03:28.440> what<00:03:28.620> I<00:03:28.650> did<00:03:28.800> so<00:03:29.100> to<00:03:29.130> make<00:03:29.460> up

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
I'll show you what I did so to make up

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:36.380 
I'll show you what I did so to make up
for<00:03:29.790> this<00:03:29.910> I<00:03:34.310> stamped<00:03:35.310> white<00:03:35.550> roses<00:03:35.880> onto<00:03:36.300> the

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
for this I stamped white roses onto the

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.720 
for this I stamped white roses onto the
pink<00:03:36.600> polish<00:03:36.900> and<00:03:37.320> today<00:03:38.040> I<00:03:38.070> put<00:03:38.190> some<00:03:38.370> stars

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
pink polish and today I put some stars

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.930 
pink polish and today I put some stars
onto<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.270> purple<00:03:39.600> one<00:03:39.980> and<00:03:40.980> this<00:03:41.460> is<00:03:41.520> how<00:03:41.730> all

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
onto the purple one and this is how all

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.290 
onto the purple one and this is how all
my<00:03:42.090> nails<00:03:42.330> looked<00:03:42.720> after<00:03:43.110> some<00:03:43.290> stamping

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
my nails looked after some stamping

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.400 
my nails looked after some stamping
since<00:03:45.300> the<00:03:45.420> patterns<00:03:45.750> weren't<00:03:46.020> all<00:03:46.140> very

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
since the patterns weren't all very

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.260 
since the patterns weren't all very
complete<00:03:46.950> I<00:03:47.220> decided<00:03:47.580> to<00:03:47.790> get<00:03:47.910> some<00:03:48.120> more

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
complete I decided to get some more

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.570 
complete I decided to get some more
polish<00:03:48.600> and<00:03:48.840> hand<00:03:49.530> paint<00:03:49.830> on<00:03:50.010> the<00:03:50.190> very<00:03:50.370> edges

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
polish and hand paint on the very edges

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.610 
polish and hand paint on the very edges
and<00:03:51.180> just<00:03:51.270> parts<00:03:51.750> with<00:03:51.900> a<00:03:51.990> Polish<00:03:52.320> hadn't

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
and just parts with a Polish hadn't

00:03:52.620 --> 00:04:02.710 
and just parts with a Polish hadn't
shown<00:03:52.800> up<00:03:52.830> too<00:03:53.130> well

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.840 

the<00:04:03.260> white<00:04:03.470> was<00:04:03.680> quite<00:04:03.860> tricky<00:04:04.100> because<00:04:04.400> we're

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
the white was quite tricky because we're

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.160 
the white was quite tricky because we're
not<00:04:04.910> was<00:04:05.060> stamped<00:04:05.450> on<00:04:05.510> it<00:04:05.690> came<00:04:05.840> out<00:04:05.990> quite

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
not was stamped on it came out quite

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.530 
not was stamped on it came out quite
translucent<00:04:07.070> but<00:04:07.640> when<00:04:07.760> it<00:04:07.880> was<00:04:07.970> painted<00:04:08.390> on

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
translucent but when it was painted on

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.330 
translucent but when it was painted on
it<00:04:08.690> was<00:04:08.810> quite<00:04:09.020> thick<00:04:09.350> and<00:04:09.890> therefore<00:04:10.070> was

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
it was quite thick and therefore was

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.490 
it was quite thick and therefore was
more<00:04:10.490> opaque<00:04:10.880> so<00:04:11.630> I<00:04:11.660> kind<00:04:11.960> of<00:04:12.020> had<00:04:12.140> to<00:04:12.230> add<00:04:12.350> some

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
more opaque so I kind of had to add some

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.110 
more opaque so I kind of had to add some
highlights<00:04:12.650> across<00:04:13.160> the<00:04:13.430> whole<00:04:13.580> nail<00:04:13.850> just<00:04:14.030> to

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
highlights across the whole nail just to

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.650 
highlights across the whole nail just to
make<00:04:14.360> it<00:04:14.480> blend<00:04:14.660> in<00:04:14.780> a<00:04:14.840> bit<00:04:14.990> more<00:04:16.330> so<00:04:17.330> here's

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
make it blend in a bit more so here's

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:18.850 
make it blend in a bit more so here's
how<00:04:17.780> to<00:04:17.840> look<00:04:18.019> -<00:04:18.170> I'll<00:04:18.380> give<00:04:18.500> them<00:04:18.560> a<00:04:18.709> few

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:18.860 
how to look - I'll give them a few

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.949 
how to look - I'll give them a few
touch-ups<00:04:19.100> which<00:04:19.519> is<00:04:19.670> a<00:04:19.700> lot<00:04:19.910> better<00:04:20.209> but

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
touch-ups which is a lot better but

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.570 
touch-ups which is a lot better but
still<00:04:21.290> I<00:04:21.320> shouldn't<00:04:21.560> have<00:04:21.709> to<00:04:21.860> really<00:04:22.130> do<00:04:22.340> that

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
still I shouldn't have to really do that

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.460 
still I shouldn't have to really do that
I<00:04:22.880> don't<00:04:23.180> know<00:04:23.300> maybe<00:04:23.660> I'm<00:04:23.810> just<00:04:23.960> really<00:04:24.110> fussy

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
I don't know maybe I'm just really fussy

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.740 
I don't know maybe I'm just really fussy
I'll<00:04:25.160> just<00:04:25.460> zoom<00:04:25.640> through<00:04:25.910> my<00:04:26.060> second<00:04:26.390> attempt

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
I'll just zoom through my second attempt

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.290 
I'll just zoom through my second attempt
I<00:04:26.900> decided<00:04:27.620> to<00:04:27.770> do<00:04:27.860> with<00:04:28.160> white<00:04:28.490> polish<00:04:28.820> and<00:04:29.120> a

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
I decided to do with white polish and a

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.570 
I decided to do with white polish and a
bigger<00:04:29.630> plate<00:04:29.900> onto<00:04:30.290> my<00:04:30.740> pink<00:04:31.040> nails

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
bigger plate onto my pink nails

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.520 
bigger plate onto my pink nails
I<00:04:31.730> think<00:04:32.360> this<00:04:32.510> bigger<00:04:32.720> plate<00:04:33.080> should<00:04:33.320> get<00:04:33.470> rid

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
I think this bigger plate should get rid

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.470 
I think this bigger plate should get rid
of<00:04:33.620> the<00:04:33.680> problem<00:04:33.980> of<00:04:34.190> it<00:04:34.460> not<00:04:34.670> fitting<00:04:35.030> on<00:04:35.330> my

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
of the problem of it not fitting on my

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.630 
of the problem of it not fitting on my
wide<00:04:35.720> finger<00:04:36.110> nails<00:04:36.320> I<00:04:36.680> also<00:04:37.130> do<00:04:37.310> really<00:04:37.490> like

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
wide finger nails I also do really like

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.280 
wide finger nails I also do really like
the<00:04:37.760> Stamper<00:04:38.150> I<00:04:38.180> was<00:04:38.330> using<00:04:38.570> last<00:04:38.720> time<00:04:39.080> so<00:04:39.260> I

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
the Stamper I was using last time so I

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.530 
the Stamper I was using last time so I
change<00:04:39.560> to<00:04:39.770> the<00:04:39.890> stem<00:04:40.130> in<00:04:40.280> my<00:04:40.370> old<00:04:40.610> one<00:04:40.850> which

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
change to the stem in my old one which

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.030 
change to the stem in my old one which
is<00:04:41.570> a<00:04:41.720> bit<00:04:41.840> bigger<00:04:42.080> and<00:04:42.350> me<00:04:42.440> for<00:04:42.620> comfort<00:04:42.920> my

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
is a bit bigger and me for comfort my

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.450 
is a bit bigger and me for comfort my
whole<00:04:43.190> nail<00:04:43.430> on<00:04:43.640> a<00:04:43.670> PITA<00:04:44.830> so<00:04:45.830> again<00:04:46.160> the<00:04:46.310> same

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
whole nail on a PITA so again the same

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:52.410 
whole nail on a PITA so again the same
method<00:04:46.790> as<00:04:46.910> last<00:04:47.120> time

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:52.420 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.080 

and<00:04:52.900> I<00:04:53.290> had<00:04:53.440> a<00:04:53.470> really<00:04:53.770> hard<00:04:54.070> time<00:04:54.220> getting<00:04:54.700> the

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
and I had a really hard time getting the

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.050 
and I had a really hard time getting the
polish<00:04:55.450> off<00:04:55.690> the<00:04:55.960> Stamper<00:04:56.590> onto<00:04:57.520> the<00:04:57.610> nail<00:04:57.790> it

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
polish off the Stamper onto the nail it

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.120 
polish off the Stamper onto the nail it
just<00:04:58.210> wouldn't<00:04:58.630> come<00:04:58.780> off<00:04:58.960> properly<00:04:59.410> and<00:04:59.650> yet

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
just wouldn't come off properly and yet

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.620 
just wouldn't come off properly and yet
came<00:05:00.370> off<00:05:00.490> me<00:05:00.730> and<00:05:00.790> they're<00:05:01.150> just<00:05:01.300> little<00:05:01.450> bits

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
came off me and they're just little bits

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.260 
came off me and they're just little bits
as<00:05:01.780> lived<00:05:01.990> on<00:05:02.170> it<00:05:02.500> was<00:05:02.620> like<00:05:02.790> funny<00:05:03.790> in<00:05:04.000> weird

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
as lived on it was like funny in weird

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.450 
as lived on it was like funny in weird
so<00:05:04.780> I<00:05:04.810> managed<00:05:05.410> to<00:05:05.470> get<00:05:05.680> something<00:05:06.070> down<00:05:06.220> here

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
so I managed to get something down here

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.240 
so I managed to get something down here
and<00:05:06.610> I<00:05:06.640> was<00:05:06.760> a<00:05:06.790> bit<00:05:06.910> prettier<00:05:07.410> but<00:05:08.410> I<00:05:08.680> wasn't

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
and I was a bit prettier but I wasn't

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.370 
and I was a bit prettier but I wasn't
happy<00:05:09.400> with<00:05:09.520> it<00:05:09.730> and<00:05:10.000> I<00:05:10.750> don't<00:05:10.900> know<00:05:11.140> if<00:05:11.260> you've

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
happy with it and I don't know if you've

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.260 
happy with it and I don't know if you've
any<00:05:11.560> ideas<00:05:11.920> for<00:05:12.130> me<00:05:12.250> please<00:05:12.820> let<00:05:12.970> me<00:05:13.030> know<00:05:13.240> I

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
any ideas for me please let me know I

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.750 
any ideas for me please let me know I
find<00:05:13.660> this<00:05:13.720> very<00:05:13.780> frustrating<00:05:14.560> I<00:05:14.760> really

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
find this very frustrating I really

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.370 
find this very frustrating I really
would<00:05:15.880> get<00:05:16.000> hold<00:05:16.180> of<00:05:16.240> some<00:05:16.450> current<00:05:16.900> ed<00:05:17.080> polish

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
would get hold of some current ed polish

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.930 
would get hold of some current ed polish
because<00:05:17.560> there<00:05:17.920> one<00:05:18.130> worked<00:05:18.340> perfectly<00:05:18.730> for
