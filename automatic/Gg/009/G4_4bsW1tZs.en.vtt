social animals we've developed a bunch

00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:37.100 
social animals we've developed a bunch
of<00:00:36.059> instincts<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.659> help<00:00:36.839> us<00:00:36.960> have

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
of instincts that help us have

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.660 
of instincts that help us have
harmonious<00:00:37.650> relationships<00:00:38.370> with<00:00:38.519> other

that help us promote good social

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:43.490 
that help us promote good social
interaction<00:00:41.970> but<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.720> unfortunately

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
interaction but that unfortunately

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.280 
interaction but that unfortunately
within<00:00:43.799> certain<00:00:44.220> social<00:00:44.460> contexts<00:00:45.299> go<00:00:45.989> out<00:00:46.170> of

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
within certain social contexts go out of

wine and that going out of line can lead

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:50.719 
wine and that going out of line can lead
to<00:00:49.140> things<00:00:49.290> like<00:00:49.470> favoritism<00:00:50.309> for<00:00:50.339> people

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:50.729 
to things like favoritism for people

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:52.789 
to things like favoritism for people
that<00:00:50.790> are<00:00:50.909> more<00:00:51.030> similar<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:52.409> can<00:00:52.589> lead

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:52.799 
that are more similar to you it can lead

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:55.119 
that are more similar to you it can lead
to<00:00:53.030> unfortunate<00:00:54.030> responses<00:00:54.659> that<00:00:54.869> are

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
to unfortunate responses that are

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.619 
to unfortunate responses that are
categorizations<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.549> other<00:00:56.699> people<00:00:57.150> in<00:00:57.420> order

to better understand them at the basic
level<00:01:00.330> but<00:01:01.019> that<00:01:01.170> can<00:01:01.320> lead<00:01:01.500> to

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:01.580 
level but that can lead to

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.920 
level but that can lead to
overestimation<00:01:02.580> of<00:01:02.780> dissimilarities<00:01:03.780> or
