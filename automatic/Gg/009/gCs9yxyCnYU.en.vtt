00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.740
 hello how about girls I'm clear and in 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.929
 this video I want to show you a cool day 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.810
 to create your own cosmetics 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.760
 a super easy and fun way I hope 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.539
 that you like this video and we are going to 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.060
 start with the bill of materials 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.279
 you need transparent plastic and 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.759
 also fabric or leatherette of the color that 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:35.050
 more you like scissors or a cutter 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:38.239
 rotating a 36- centimeter closure 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.879
 also stickers of different designs 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.100
 letters of colored stones and what more 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:46.810
 you like to decorate your cosmetiqueras 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.630
 and finally your sewing machine 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:52.060
 the first step is to cut two rectangles 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:54.550
 of plastic that measure 14 centimeters of 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.920
 wide by 32 centimeters long each 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.380
 one to make it easier 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.440
 cut them using a cutting mat and 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.839
 also a rotary cutter and the 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.340
 result are going to be two rectangles like 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.039
 these 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.710
 let's do exactly the same with 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:13.960
 the fabric or the poly skin that you chose and in 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.020
 if you have chosen leatherette I 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.040
 I recommend cutting it to a size of 12 x 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.440
 32 centimeters long 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.720
 and if you prefer to use fabric to 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.430
 do your cosmetic simply do it 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.910
 a small hem so you do not 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.620
 fray and stay to the same extent 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.660
 when the rectangles are ready 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.950
 you need to take the closure that you 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.470
 want me for example I'm going to use 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.540
 one in white because I like how 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.390
 combine with green and hold it with 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.520
 these tweezers so as not to damage the leatherette and 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.600
 that also at the time of sewing it 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.600
 keep right 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.530
 and this we are going to do with the two 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:57.600
 rectangles to join them by means of the 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.600
 close and that we stay this way 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.990
 then we are going to join the two rectangles 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.420
 of plastic with the ones of polipiel I te 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.640
 I recommend joining the plastic with a little 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.819
 of magic tape so that when sewing it 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.860
 much easier and do not move and another 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.840
 topic that I would like to give you is that you 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.030
 put some magic tape on your 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.130
 sewing machine or also a sheet of 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.580
 paper so that the plastic does not stick and 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.380
 slide much better 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.420
 to finish knowing our 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.480
 cosmetiquera you just have to give 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.520
 turn around and sew it all around 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:35.740
 leaving approximately one centimeter of 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.740
 distance between the edge and the seam 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.540
 Now we just need to give you the 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.420
 return to our cosmetiquera and will be 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.370
 I made 3 different cosmetics 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.740
 I think they look super cute 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.200
 just as they have remained however I want 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.150
 add a more personalized touch and 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.610
 I'm going to decorate them with three designs 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.010
 different 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.560
 to decorate the first cosmetiquera 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.810
 use some golden letters that 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.730
 I loved them because I think they make a 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.100
 very striking contrast with color 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.500
 green and I'm thinking what word 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.930
 form with the letters and in the end I decided 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:16.330
 put my name because I think that that 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.330
 would give a more personalized touch 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.329
 now we go with the second idea in the 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:23.610
 which one uses a few pebbles in color 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.680
 black that combine with the thread and also 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.569
 with the closure and I really liked these 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.340
 pebbles because they stick with a 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.939
 glue that comes by the part of 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.310
 back and I think they look divine and 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:37.379
 finally the third cosmetic the 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.900
 decorate with some stickers that have 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:42.659
 different designs in the form of cerecita 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.030
 of cocktails and also drinks 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:46.859
 exotic and I loved them because being 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.930
 transparent makes the plastic 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:51.870
 look like you have these printed 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.959
 images and it also gives a very 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.849
 fun to this design and that's how 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.069
 My cosmetics remained, the truth is 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:01.079
 that all three have enchanted me but if 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.940
 you have a favorite please 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:05.190
