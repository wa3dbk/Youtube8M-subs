of you so you can see a little bit more

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.940 
of you so you can see a little bit more
obviously<00:01:13.720> it's<00:01:13.869> some<00:01:13.990> incidence<00:01:14.380> we<00:01:14.560> attend

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
obviously it's some incidence we attend

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.649 
obviously it's some incidence we attend
but<00:01:15.159> what<00:01:15.310> we<00:01:15.400> have<00:01:15.729> to<00:01:15.759> do<00:01:15.940> sometimes<00:01:16.180> is<00:01:16.509> what

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
but what we have to do sometimes is what

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.749 
but what we have to do sometimes is what
there's<00:01:16.840> a<00:01:16.960> rapid<00:01:17.259> X<00:01:17.440> the<00:01:18.040> rapid<00:01:18.310> excitation

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
there's a rapid X the rapid excitation

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:20.940 
there's a rapid X the rapid excitation
of<00:01:19.060> Accountancy<00:01:19.690> because<00:01:20.170> their<00:01:20.320> condition

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
of Accountancy because their condition

is deteriorating and they need to get to
a<00:01:23.200> hospital<00:01:23.259> ASAP<00:01:24.330> sometimes<00:01:25.330> we<00:01:25.479> have<00:01:25.630> to

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
a hospital ASAP sometimes we have to

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.350 
a hospital ASAP sometimes we have to
work<00:01:25.960> a<00:01:26.050> little<00:01:26.140> bit<00:01:26.290> more<00:01:26.409> quicker<00:01:27.360> obviously

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
work a little bit more quicker obviously

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.700 
work a little bit more quicker obviously
it's<00:01:28.600> the<00:01:28.659> president<00:01:29.020> is<00:01:29.080> right<00:01:29.259> so<00:01:29.560> the
