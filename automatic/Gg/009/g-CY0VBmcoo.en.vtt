00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:07.149
 we have stele pÃ©rez 93 20 has arrived 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:09.730
 because the battery is crossed out in this case 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:12.249
 the battery crossed with the with good 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.570
 lighting is another battery crossed out that 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:16.270
 we had already explained it in video 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.250
 previously that's when it's the short 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.890
 in the capacitors that are close to the 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.810
 display connector but in this case not 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.370
 in this case it is well illuminated the 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.280
 battery crossed out meaning that 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.740
 it can be the line 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.680
 from one of the dolphin lines of 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.120
 batteries then let's proceed to 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.250
 highlight it 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.489
 or more than everything is like update 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.860
 for those who are already in the course of 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.559
 9320 movie and they will also promote 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.469
 who have not bought it yet 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:50.430
 that here I will not explain this where 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:50.430
 I connected it here 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.810
 about the processor takes about two 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.790
 resistors that have values in 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.610
 years and they also have to get there 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.350
 some voltages to those resistances for 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.920
 to know if they are good or are 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.810
 damaged 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.870
 this is to update those who already 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:12.250
 participated and soldered here in a 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:16.210
 line a jumper from the second point 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.210
 of the end of the battery 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.549
 from the second end of the battery and 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:28.020
 soldier the other one to where already it 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.020
 we had explained in the course 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.140
 now let's see that the phone 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.470
 turn on normally and with this you 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.290
 They will also know that if they have a solution 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.800
 some things that so far 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.800
 it seems not to have 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.530
 let's learn lousy 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.590
 I hope it turns on and we see that it is 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.440
 turning on and that now does not come out 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.720
 battery and that the phone is going to 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.000
 turn on correctly more wait than 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.850
 we did 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.950
 we already see the phone turning on 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:23.370
 perfectly and this is because the 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:27.300
 line that has to combat digital x 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:30.570
 rx had not continued the resistance of 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.540
 10 this year because there are two resistances 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:36.420
 that make this an entry and exit 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.220
 from the processor and when it is not 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.220
 this continuity throughout the telephone 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.810
 our battery of crossed out with that the 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.209
 we will be able to solve with the plans 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.010
 that we received from the course and with this 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.870
 It also motivated colleagues who do not 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.330
 they have acquired the course so that they know 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.520
 all working and can repair 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.580
 this many situations that have left 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.140
 of your premises that have had a solution and not 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.120
 We have been able to repair them helpful
