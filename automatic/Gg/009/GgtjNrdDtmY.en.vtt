ones right at the beginning right at the

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:50.059 
ones right at the beginning right at the
end<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:49.200> guess<00:01:49.469> you<00:01:49.590> could<00:01:49.710> call<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:50.039> the

end of I guess you could call it the

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:51.620 
end of I guess you could call it the
introduction<00:01:50.609> with<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.909> right<00:01:51.149> hand<00:01:51.359> playing

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
introduction with the right hand playing

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.370 
introduction with the right hand playing
by<00:01:51.810> itself

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
by itself

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.620 
by itself
you'll<00:01:53.039> hear<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.880> left<00:01:54.149> hand<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.600> right

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
you'll hear the left hand and the right

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.830 
you'll hear the left hand and the right
hand<00:01:54.810> just<00:01:55.170> hit<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.250> couple<00:01:57.240> times<00:01:57.450> in<00:01:57.599> a<00:01:57.659> row

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
hand just hit a couple times in a row

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:05.770

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:14.100 

so<00:02:06.780> those<00:02:06.990> hits

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.870 

come<00:02:15.040> right<00:02:15.280> at<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.520> end<00:02:15.670> of<00:02:15.790> the

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
come right at the end of the

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.180 
come right at the end of the
introduction<00:02:16.680> so<00:02:17.680> let's<00:02:17.890> say<00:02:18.040> I'm<00:02:18.160> playing
