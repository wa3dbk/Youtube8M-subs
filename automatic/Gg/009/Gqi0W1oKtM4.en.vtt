00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
one's pretty small but the first one I

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.150 
one's pretty small but the first one I
thought<00:00:09.840> I<00:00:09.900> would<00:00:10.139> show<00:00:10.290> you<00:00:10.349> guys<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.590> raid

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
thought I would show you guys a raid

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.160 
thought I would show you guys a raid
that<00:00:11.370> I<00:00:11.400> was<00:00:11.580> doing<00:00:11.969> I<00:00:12.120> was<00:00:12.870> sort<00:00:13.080> of<00:00:13.110> just

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
that I was doing I was sort of just

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.810 
that I was doing I was sort of just
raiding<00:00:13.530> by<00:00:13.650> myself<00:00:14.040> I<00:00:14.190> needed<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.519> keep<00:00:14.670> my

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
raiding by myself I needed to keep my

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.939 
raiding by myself I needed to keep my
trophy<00:00:15.269> count<00:00:15.480> up<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:16.230> came<00:00:16.470> across<00:00:16.619> a

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
trophy count up and I came across a

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.710 
trophy count up and I came across a
fully<00:00:17.369> maxed<00:00:17.820> out<00:00:17.940> base<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.420> I<00:00:18.449> thought<00:00:18.630> it

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
fully maxed out base and I thought it

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.849 
fully maxed out base and I thought it
would<00:00:18.810> be<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:18.930> perfect<00:00:19.439> thing<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.590> try<00:00:19.830> to

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
would be a perfect thing to try to

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.650 
would be a perfect thing to try to
attack<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.369> see<00:00:20.490> what<00:00:20.609> we<00:00:20.699> can<00:00:20.850> do<00:00:21.029> so<00:00:21.630> I

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
attack and see what we can do so I

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.120 
attack and see what we can do so I
already<00:00:21.960> lured<00:00:22.140> out<00:00:22.320> his<00:00:22.500> barb<00:00:22.740> King<00:00:22.949> his

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
direction and they they naturally try to

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.470 
direction and they they naturally try to
attack<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.609> buildings<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.090> want<00:01:00.329> them

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
taken out because that really helps with

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.969 
taken out because that really helps with
this<00:01:20.759> type<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:20.970> raid<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.479> at<00:01:22.170> this<00:01:22.409> point<00:01:22.680> it

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
this type of raid and at this point it

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.170 
this type of raid and at this point it
looks<00:01:23.009> like<00:01:23.340> we<00:01:23.520> have<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.670> pretty<00:01:23.850> good<00:01:24.030> chance

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
looks like we have a pretty good chance

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.640 
looks like we have a pretty good chance
of<00:01:24.299> getting<00:01:24.390> three<00:01:24.720> stars<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.200> dropped<00:01:25.500> some

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
of getting three stars I dropped some

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.469 
of getting three stars I dropped some
archers<00:01:26.040> those<00:01:26.580> guys<00:01:26.790> helped<00:01:27.060> take<00:01:27.210> care<00:01:27.420> of

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
archers those guys helped take care of

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.760 
archers those guys helped take care of
some<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.720> freebies<00:01:28.080> on<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.259> bottom<00:01:28.590> and

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
some of the freebies on the bottom and

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.140 
some of the freebies on the bottom and
make<00:01:28.799> sure<00:01:29.130> my<00:01:29.280> guys<00:01:29.400> didn't<00:01:29.759> get<00:01:29.820> distracted

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
make sure my guys didn't get distracted

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.690 
make sure my guys didn't get distracted
and<00:01:30.740> really<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.829> only<00:01:31.890> thing<00:01:32.159> I'm<00:01:32.430> worried

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
and really the only thing I'm worried

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.940 
and really the only thing I'm worried
about<00:01:32.729> is<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.900> last<00:01:34.110> wizard<00:01:34.530> tower<00:01:34.680> and

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
about is the the last wizard tower and

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.649 
about is the the last wizard tower and
seeing<00:01:35.610> as<00:01:35.700> my<00:01:35.790> Archer<00:01:36.090> Queens<00:01:36.270> right<00:01:36.420> there<00:01:36.630> I

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
seeing as my Archer Queens right there I

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:37.789 
seeing as my Archer Queens right there I
think<00:01:36.750> she's<00:01:37.079> going<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.320> do<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.439> pretty<00:01:37.590> good

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
think she's going to do a pretty good

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.679 
think she's going to do a pretty good
job<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:37.979> taking<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.430> out<00:01:38.490> so<00:01:39.240> right<00:01:39.360> now<00:01:39.509> it's

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
job of taking it out so right now it's

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:40.670 
job of taking it out so right now it's
sort<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:39.869> just<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.110> race<00:01:40.259> against<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.560> clock

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
sort of just to race against the clock

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.980 
sort of just to race against the clock
we're<00:01:41.070> at<00:01:41.159> 80%<00:01:41.490> we're<00:01:42.420> taking<00:01:42.689> care<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:42.869> some

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
we're at 80% we're taking care of some

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.200 
we're at 80% we're taking care of some
of<00:01:43.079> these<00:01:43.140> outside<00:01:43.530> buildings<00:01:44.100> we<00:01:44.939> do<00:01:45.060> have

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
of these outside buildings we do have

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.609

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
the archer tower and cannon right there

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:47.780 
the archer tower and cannon right there
