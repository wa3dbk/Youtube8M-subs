00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
within the narrative of the story now we

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.570 
within the narrative of the story now we
call<00:00:51.720> them<00:00:51.839> natural<00:00:52.290> disasters<00:00:52.800> for<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.100> reason

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:53.580 
call them natural disasters for a reason

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.640 
call them natural disasters for a reason
because<00:00:54.059> they're<00:00:54.420> natural<00:00:55.080> you<00:00:55.530> know

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:55.650 
because they're natural you know

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.740 
because they're natural you know
earthquakes<00:00:56.400> tend<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.790> happen<00:00:57.119> a<00:00:57.239> tectonic

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
earthquakes tend to happen a tectonic

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.229 
earthquakes tend to happen a tectonic
faults<00:00:58.320> hurricanes<00:00:59.309> tend<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.729> happen<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.150> the

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
faults hurricanes tend to happen in the

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.600 
faults hurricanes tend to happen in the
tropics<00:01:00.689> and<00:01:00.900> tsunamis<00:01:01.799> tend<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.129> happen<00:01:02.280> near

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
tropics and tsunamis tend to happen near

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.329 
tropics and tsunamis tend to happen near
water<00:01:02.939> we<00:01:03.900> call<00:01:04.140> them<00:01:04.229> natural<00:01:04.769> disasters

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
water we call them natural disasters

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.880 
water we call them natural disasters
because<00:01:05.489> they're<00:01:05.880> natural<00:01:06.630> not<00:01:07.320> supernatural

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
because they're natural not supernatural

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.280 
because they're natural not supernatural
so<00:01:08.460> if<00:01:08.610> there<00:01:08.759> were<00:01:08.850> super<00:01:09.450> natural<00:01:09.750> disasters

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
so if there were super natural disasters

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.289 
so if there were super natural disasters
which<00:01:10.590> go<00:01:10.799> with<00:01:10.979> supernatural<00:01:11.369> judgment<00:01:12.150> and

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
which go with supernatural judgment and

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.700 
which go with supernatural judgment and
they<00:01:12.600> were<00:01:12.659> on<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.049> increase<00:01:13.350> than<00:01:13.560> our

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
they were on the increase than our

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.499 
they were on the increase than our
Christian<00:01:14.520> friend<00:01:14.759> him<00:01:14.909> might<00:01:15.060> have<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.240> point

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
Christian friend him might have a point

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.780 
Christian friend him might have a point
so<00:01:16.079> for<00:01:16.350> instance<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.799> really<00:01:17.250> good<00:01:17.369> example<00:01:17.759> of

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
so for instance a really good example of

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.690 
so for instance a really good example of
a<00:01:17.909> super<00:01:18.509> natural<00:01:18.840> disaster<00:01:19.290> would<00:01:19.409> be<00:01:19.700> Denver

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
a super natural disaster would be Denver

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.510 
a super natural disaster would be Denver
getting<00:01:21.210> wiped<00:01:21.570> out<00:01:21.810> by<00:01:22.079> a<00:01:22.110> tsunami<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:23.220> so

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
getting wiped out by a tsunami that so

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.279 
getting wiped out by a tsunami that so
comes<00:01:23.820> from<00:01:24.030> nowhere<00:01:24.180> vanish<00:01:24.630> again

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:25.289 
comes from nowhere vanish again

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:27.349 
comes from nowhere vanish again
afterwards<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.100> know<00:01:26.159> Denver<00:01:26.549> being<00:01:26.789> one<00:01:27.329> of

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:27.359 
afterwards you know Denver being one of

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:29.389 
afterwards you know Denver being one of
two<00:01:27.719> cuz<00:01:28.109> of<00:01:28.259> miles<00:01:28.439> from<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.740> ocean<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:29.100> every

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
two cuz of miles from the ocean in every

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:31.249 
two cuz of miles from the ocean in every
direction<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:30.299> would<00:01:30.450> be<00:01:30.569> a<00:01:30.600> really<00:01:31.049> good

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
direction that would be a really good

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.099 
direction that would be a really good
example<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.859> a<00:01:32.219> super<00:01:32.700> natural<00:01:33.060> disaster<00:01:33.569> but

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:34.109 
example of a super natural disaster but

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:35.809 
example of a super natural disaster but
regrettably<00:01:34.649> at<00:01:34.859> the<00:01:34.950> moment<00:01:35.249> we<00:01:35.399> have<00:01:35.609> a<00:01:35.640> bit

00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:35.819 
regrettably at the moment we have a bit

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:38.300 
regrettably at the moment we have a bit
of<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:35.969> positive<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.869> super<00:01:37.380> natural<00:01:37.740> disasters

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
of a positive of super natural disasters

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.719 
of a positive of super natural disasters
and<00:01:38.960> maybe<00:01:39.960> that's<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.560> point<00:01:40.889> in<00:01:41.549> the

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
and maybe that's the point in the

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.760 
and maybe that's the point in the
natural<00:01:42.149> disasters<00:01:42.810> whether<00:01:43.020> people<00:01:43.289> like<00:01:43.619> to

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
natural disasters whether people like to

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.720 
natural disasters whether people like to
think<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.100> them<00:01:44.280> as<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:45.060> or<00:01:45.270> not

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:46.730 
think of them as this or not

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.840 
think of them as this or not
sometimes<00:01:47.120> God's<00:01:47.680> meeting<00:01:48.680> out<00:01:48.850> discipline

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
sometimes God's meeting out discipline

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.470 
sometimes God's meeting out discipline
and<00:01:50.270> if<00:01:50.510> this<00:01:50.630> is<00:01:50.690> true<00:01:51.430> we're<00:01:52.430> done<00:01:52.610> with<00:01:53.330> the

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480 
and if this is true we're done with the

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.510 
and if this is true we're done with the
negative<00:01:53.780> disaster<00:01:54.410> thing<00:01:54.650> I<00:01:54.920> think<00:01:55.400> it's

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
negative disaster thing I think it's

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.790 
negative disaster thing I think it's
just<00:01:55.670> beginning<00:01:56.150> that's<00:01:56.780> a<00:01:56.990> mighty<00:01:57.440> fine

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
just beginning that's a mighty fine

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.710 
just beginning that's a mighty fine
