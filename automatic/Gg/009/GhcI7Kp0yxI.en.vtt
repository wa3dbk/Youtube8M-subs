00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:09.380
 what are the rules of selection 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:13.099
 polarized glasses 0 points like 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:17.840
 such generally means the first is 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:20.539
 the convenience of landing on the face if the frame you 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.279
 slightly david then trust me after some 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.689
 time these points you have to throw away 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:29.539
 need headaches you will be provided 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:34.610
 the second as for the polarization itself 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:36.920
 then lenses exist as glass and 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.520
 polycarbonate plastic polycarbonate this 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.080
 modern material 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.600
 fairly light at the same time 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.530
 strong enough glass is like 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:50.120
 classic but it is relatively heavy and 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:53.250
 accordingly there is the color of the lenses 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.580
 very dark and even coated for 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.950
 very bright sunny weather when it goes 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.500
 very much and reflection from the water here 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.210
 there is a lens lighter with such 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.880
 same effect with quality effect 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.790
 polarization here but for let's say overcast 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.640
 weather for the forest repch when you have 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.009
 the background is constantly changing then light 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.440
 dark 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:18.060
 company Costa del Mar has a model points 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.590
 which are intended 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.820
 well, how do they themselves represent for 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.590
 tropics for a very bright sun but she 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.050
 has an additional mirror coating 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.860
 which can be here blue and 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:34.050
 there is green or mirror color 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:38.130
 this is the lens for what it needs it 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:40.910
 cleans up cleans up extra 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.450
 there is extra bright sunshine 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:46.069
 protects your eyes even more have 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.899
 of the company 

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:50.580
 so-called 400 series points then 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.630
 classical polarization 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.920
 good enough good quality 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.770
 manufacturing 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.810
 lenses can be like polycarbonate like me 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:06.119
 already said so maybe glass and u 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:12.080
 the company developed a new technology 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:15.080
 the so -called 580 series which gives 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:21.150
 extra contrast 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:24.450
 let's say in reflected light is so 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.940
 called yellow spectrum which has 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.950
 length of 580 on meters and here it is 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:33.480
 addition technology removes this 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:36.269
 the yellow spectrum thereby improves 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.180
 the contrast this glasses model is called 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:43.140
 mono gates as an example 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:46.790
 spoke difference drags on glasses practically 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:51.750
 the same that others just 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:55.739
 goes so mark on glasses 580 series sphere 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:58.920
 400 than the principle is different here 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:04.290
 wearing glasses is also engraving right here 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:06.359
 here is 580 t580 580 series for this means 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.060
 polycarbonate if this glass is just 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:12.000
 there will be 580 series just designation on 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.340
 400 series here this designation is not if 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.500
 choose can pay look at 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:21.810
 lens will then be all clear here on the Rights of 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.350
 cover the so-called instant material 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.079
 blinked 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:28.709
 what it gives what effect the more you 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:30.750
 sweat the better it sticks to your 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.859
 skin it is hypoallergenic no irritation 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.530
 happens to him 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:36.720
 that is, the glasses are tight enough well 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.930
 sit on face 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.819
 but as I said it again the first 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.920
 rule is the convenience of landing 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:48.470
 you wear everything to be nice and 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.470
 comfortable here nowhere pressed nothing
