actually make your deck to a thirty six
card<00:01:07.500> deck<00:01:07.650> if<00:01:07.799> you're<00:01:07.920> on<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.040> upstarts<00:01:08.369> with

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
card deck if you're on the upstarts with

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.920 
card deck if you're on the upstarts with
it<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:08.970> it's<00:01:09.090> actually<00:01:09.180> within<00:01:09.600> your<00:01:09.750> deck

faster<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.590> second<00:01:10.860> thing<00:01:10.979> was<00:01:11.070> really<00:01:11.430> good

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
faster the second thing was really good

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.370 
faster the second thing was really good
is<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.600> won't<00:01:12.659> be<00:01:12.810> dying<00:01:12.990> next<00:01:13.229> turn

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
is that you won't be dying next turn

is that you won't be dying next turn
it's<00:01:13.650> kind<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:13.890> like<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.070> cold<00:01:14.310> wave<00:01:14.549> but<00:01:15.090> for

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509
