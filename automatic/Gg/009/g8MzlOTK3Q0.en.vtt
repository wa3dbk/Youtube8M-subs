of<00:01:31.290> using<00:01:31.470> those<00:01:31.710> now<00:01:32.220> let's<00:01:32.549> talk<00:01:32.670> about<00:01:32.729> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
of using those now let's talk about the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.050 
of using those now let's talk about the
v8<00:01:33.450> 70<00:01:33.840> for<00:01:33.990> example<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:35.159> in<00:01:35.400> my<00:01:35.549> opinion<00:01:35.820> is

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
v8 70 for example that in my opinion is

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.520 
v8 70 for example that in my opinion is
the<00:01:36.240> best<00:01:36.270> shotgun<00:01:36.780> for<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.020> average<00:01:37.200> player

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
the best shotgun for the average player

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.590 
the best shotgun for the average player
to<00:01:37.650> use<00:01:37.799> for<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.100> noob<00:01:38.250> friendly<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.970> KSG<00:01:39.299> is

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
to use for the noob friendly the KSG is

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.819 
to use for the noob friendly the KSG is
slightly<00:01:39.869> better<00:01:40.079> than<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.439> one<00:01:40.560> but<00:01:40.710> it's

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
slightly better than that one but it's

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.200 
slightly better than that one but it's
far<00:01:40.920> more<00:01:40.979> challenging<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.759> advantage

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
far more challenging and the advantage

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.569 
far more challenging and the advantage
for<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.630> 870<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:44.040> it's<00:01:44.250> much<00:01:44.430> more

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
for the 870 is that it's much more

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.789 
for the 870 is that it's much more
reliable<00:01:44.880> at<00:01:45.210> hip<00:01:45.420> firing<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:46.140> it's<00:01:46.530> got<00:01:46.680> the

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
reliable at hip firing and it's got the

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.109 
reliable at hip firing and it's got the
spread<00:01:47.100> damage<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.700> need<00:01:47.880> when<00:01:48.090> you

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
spread damage that you need when you

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.030 
spread damage that you need when you
want<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.630> know<00:01:48.720> kill<00:01:48.930> people<00:01:49.290> with<00:01:49.740> range

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
want to you know kill people with range

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.580 
want to you know kill people with range
as<00:01:50.220> well<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:50.939> again<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:52.079> know<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.259> got<00:01:52.470> to

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
outside of the KSG in the 870 use the

court takes a lot of time and I dreaded
that<00:02:10.679> factor<00:02:11.069> that's<00:02:11.220> what<00:02:11.430> took<00:02:11.640> it<00:02:11.790> most

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
that factor that's what took it most

six hours unlocked diamond it was very

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.170 
six hours unlocked diamond it was very
very<00:02:25.650> challenging<00:02:25.860> because<00:02:26.340> there<00:02:27.000> are<00:02:27.060> many

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
very challenging because there are many

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.490 
very challenging because there are many
times<00:02:27.420> you<00:02:27.569> shoot<00:02:27.810> a<00:02:27.870> guy<00:02:27.959> and<00:02:28.079> you<00:02:28.140> won't<00:02:28.319> die

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
before and it generally doesn't count so

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.369

to be completely honest the best way to

full party in TDM where all of you guys
are<00:02:38.459> using<00:02:38.579> UAVs<00:02:38.819> because<00:02:39.780> you'd<00:02:39.930> be<00:02:40.019> shocked

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
are using UAVs because you'd be shocked

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.690 
are using UAVs because you'd be shocked
at<00:02:40.409> how<00:02:40.530> many<00:02:40.590> people<00:02:40.709> that<00:02:41.069> do<00:02:41.250> not<00:02:41.459> actually

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
at how many people that do not actually

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.550 
at how many people that do not actually
use<00:02:42.000> ghost<00:02:42.269> or<00:02:42.540> are<00:02:42.720> camping<00:02:43.140> so<00:02:43.319> it's<00:02:43.439> not

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
use ghost or are camping so it's not

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.710 
use ghost or are camping so it's not
going<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.739> really<00:02:43.829> matter<00:02:44.099> but<00:02:44.909> playing<00:02:45.599> it

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
going to really matter but playing it

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.210 
going to really matter but playing it
hardcore<00:02:46.139> is<00:02:46.290> very<00:02:46.470> very<00:02:46.650> difficult<00:02:46.889> because

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
hardcore is very very difficult because

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.949 
hardcore is very very difficult because
of<00:02:47.670> not<00:02:47.819> only<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.120> spawn<00:02:48.359> delay<00:02:48.510> so<00:02:48.690> every

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
of not only the spawn delay so every

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.149 
of not only the spawn delay so every
time<00:02:49.019> you<00:02:49.139> die<00:02:49.349> you<00:02:49.409> got<00:02:49.709> to<00:02:49.799> wait<00:02:49.920> you<00:02:50.040> know

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
time you die you got to wait you know

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:52.039 
time you die you got to wait you know
seven<00:02:50.579> seconds<00:02:50.909> ten<00:02:51.060> seconds<00:02:51.450> however<00:02:51.599> long

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
seven seconds ten seconds however long

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.750 
seven seconds ten seconds however long
which<00:02:52.650> really<00:02:52.889> really<00:02:53.099> does<00:02:53.250> slow<00:02:53.459> down<00:02:53.639> the

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
which really really does slow down the

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
which really really does slow down the
process<00:02:53.940> that<00:02:54.150> you're<00:02:54.359> trying<00:02:54.569> to<00:02:54.690> achieve

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
process that you're trying to achieve

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.539
