00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.469
 I feel very good this is a fundamental aspect of the print media 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:31.680
 it symbolizes the coming of the Messiah long awaited by all 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.469
 states it's also a way to get together between fidel and share this 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:36.659
 moment

 rigid to gather as well between believers between non-believers but 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:45.729
 I must admit that 

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:49.869
 the social center of the holiday and much more important indeed according to a 

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:53.399

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:54.179

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:15.419
 let's first start with a goal of cetto 

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:20.310

 cardiac from which comes from a manger 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.990
 but by extension the class apart 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.400

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:34.909

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:46.610
 the first tasks as we know them also their appearance 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.729

 initiative that had the goal of marking the 24 days preceding Christmas 

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:41.719
 his four candles symbolize the four great moments of his life preceding the 

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:45.809
 coming from the messiah the first she gets excited about forgiveness granted to afp to

 on his way 

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.919

 temptation no atrium in the garden of Eden 

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:59.899
