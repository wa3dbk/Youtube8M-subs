a polarity switch typically I'm going to
be<00:00:58.970> running<00:00:59.299> in<00:00:59.420> an<00:00:59.659> american-made<00:01:00.290> amp<00:01:00.710> and<00:01:00.890> a

be running in an american-made amp and a

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:02.320 
be running in an american-made amp and a
British<00:01:01.129> made<00:01:01.400> amp<00:01:01.640> so<00:01:01.850> I've<00:01:01.970> got<00:01:02.150> two

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:02.330 
British made amp so I've got two

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:03.789 
British made amp so I've got two
completely<00:01:02.750> different<00:01:02.960> sounds<00:01:03.379> to<00:01:03.470> work<00:01:03.619> with

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
completely different sounds to work with

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:05.710 
completely different sounds to work with
I<00:01:04.040> know<00:01:04.369> right<00:01:04.790> off<00:01:04.820> the<00:01:05.089> bat<00:01:05.269> I'm<00:01:05.449> going<00:01:05.600> to<00:01:05.659> be

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
I know right off the bat I'm going to be

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.780 
I know right off the bat I'm going to be
out<00:01:05.840> of<00:01:05.869> phase<00:01:06.170> so<00:01:06.500> when<00:01:06.950> I<00:01:06.979> hit<00:01:07.159> both<00:01:07.400> of<00:01:07.430> them

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
out of phase so when I hit both of them

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.179 
out of phase so when I hit both of them
if<00:01:07.970> I<00:01:08.420> don't<00:01:08.689> have<00:01:08.869> a<00:01:08.900> polarity<00:01:09.200> switch<00:01:09.680> it's

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
if I don't have a polarity switch it's

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:12.280 
if I don't have a polarity switch it's
gonna<00:01:10.430> sound<00:01:10.640> a<00:01:10.820> little<00:01:10.850> strange<00:01:11.090> I've<00:01:12.020> got<00:01:12.260> a

and if I've got too many things in the
audio<00:01:37.070> chain<00:01:37.460> or<00:01:37.790> I've<00:01:38.000> got<00:01:38.270> too<00:01:38.720> many

audio chain or I've got too many

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.020 
audio chain or I've got too many
connections<00:01:39.200> I<00:01:39.650> start<00:01:40.159> to<00:01:40.310> lose<00:01:40.520> that<00:01:40.550> so<00:01:41.000> I

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
connections I start to lose that so I

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.330 
connections I start to lose that so I
can<00:01:41.270> dial<00:01:41.570> back<00:01:41.690> in<00:01:42.110> and<00:01:42.350> get<00:01:42.800> my<00:01:42.950> pickup

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
can dial back in and get my pickup

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.530 
can dial back in and get my pickup
