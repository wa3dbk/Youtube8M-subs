00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.420
 m 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.840
 hello I am pascal of the site instinct 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:21.849
 guitar points as in what order 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.770
 should you put your fingers on the handle 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:26.289
 so in an ideal world it would take 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.250
 able to place or move fingers 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.130
 instant way 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.270
 in order to thin the 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.890
 concatenations of agreements in particular 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.110
 but in practice it takes time 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.030
 that we must moves from one position 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.739
 to the other and above all it is necessary that our 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.570
 brain manage manage different 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.730
 movements of different customs that do not 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.500
 not necessarily in the same direction 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.089
 it is obvious that we can not 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.949
 dissect all these movements of 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:49.360
 instant way so with the 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:51.730
 practice it will be necessary to create 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.039
 automatisms create reflexes and 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.050
 memorize the sensations of the different 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:58.149
 positions in order to chained them 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.649
 without having to think but 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.180
 waiting to have been able to develop his 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.890
 reflexes what will be done as and when 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.899
 measure of our progress on the guitar 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.460
 we are sometimes forced to place 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:08.860
 the fingers a parent is to break down 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.030
 movements and this difficulty does not 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.860
 not that guitarists 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.869
 beginners time there are two positions 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.000
 different and therefore sequences 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.979
 possible in this video we will 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.050
 so make sure to determine the 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.240
 priorities to know which finger should 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.069
 be placed first for cases where 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.009
 we would not be able to place them 

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:28.539
 all simultaneously the reflex that have the 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.550
 most people is to place the 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:32.229
 fingers in order regardless of the 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.060
 okay position so he places first 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.280
 the index then the middle finger then the ring finger 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.420
 then the little finger if necessary 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.980
 take the example of the agreement of 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.140
 damage hours 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.460
 so it's like putting the index first 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.920
 on the first box of the second 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.170
 rope then the middle finger on the second 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.030
 fourth string box and finally 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.460
 the ring finger on the third box of the 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.530
 fifth string 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.850
 so this principle works to place 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.100
 the agreement but it is not necessarily 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.810
 the most interesting order since in 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.240
 most cases we will have to wait 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.840
 to have placed the third must for 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.190
 can start or continue playing 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.479
 to understand in which case it can 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.770
 to pose a problem we will dissect 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.630
 three ways to play 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.009
 so first of all when we play a 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.510
 rhythmic for which we must play 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.900
 all the notes of the agreement 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.900
 simultaneously 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.160
 we do not really have a choice if 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.819
 we want chained the agreements of 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.530
 fluid way 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.730
 it will have to change position very 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.680
 quickly 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.810
 and 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.459
 almost instantaneously by 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.260
 therefore, as long as you do not master 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.120
 perfectly agree positions that 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.010
 we want to use the risk of 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.200
 mark downtime and break 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.700
 the regularity of rhythm what we 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.549
 talk today will therefore have no 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.739
 influence on this type of rhythm where it 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.359
 can be interesting to study the order 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.549
 finger placement is by 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:51.099
 example if we alternate the bass and the 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:53.549
 other note of the agreement whether it be at 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:53.549
 pick 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.880
 or on the roof 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.090
 no 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.090
 you 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.640
 here as we play only the basis of 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.050
 the agreement at the start 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.050
 in that finger to play 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.490
 this bass is positioned no matter 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.569
 if the other fingers are not yet 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.609
 placed 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.349
 priority when changing 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:25.150
 agree and therefore often prepare the 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:26.889
 bass on the four chords that I 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.260
 just played we had a major C 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:31.209
 so we can afford not to place 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.379
 the ring finger only on the third box of 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.239
 the fifth rope for power 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.499
 start playing 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.629
 which leaves us a little respite 

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:40.180
 extra to place the two 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:41.469
 other fingers reverse if I had 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.129
 placed the fingers starting with 

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:44.260
 index 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:46.480
 I could not have started playing 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.129
 it would have been necessary to wait until 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.350
 two other fingers be placed for 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:52.930
 to be able to start playing 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.700
 I then played a minor whose 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.370
 base is on the fifth rope to 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.370
 empty so here we can chained without 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.950
 even having placed a single finger 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.810
 and 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.879
 same principle about the minor I played 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.330
 then the base is on the 6th 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.330
 empty cords 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.760
 and finally I played a G major sol 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:16.620
 base is on the third box of 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.720
 the bass tuning so just 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.430
 place the middle finger on this note for 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.750
 to be able to chained and salacious a small 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.920
 stay to place the other two 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.840
 fingers 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.980
 I will replay these four agreements 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.460
 replacing the fingers always at 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.460
 last moment 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.720
 Oh 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.420
 Oh 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.040
 so here I'm exaggerating even since I have 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.210
 away from the fingers of the handle while 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.980
 it's totally useless 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.360
 it's just to show you that this 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:51.010
 principle give me plenty of time 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.010
 to prepare myself for the next agreement 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.400
 or 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.640
 you will understand that there is no 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:00.130
 a frozen order for the placement of 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.360
 fingers everything depends on the context here as 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.129
 I played bass first 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.379
 it was necessary to prioritize 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:08.689
 finger that corresponds to the base note of 

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:10.340
 the agreement and according to the positions that 

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:12.229
 may sometimes be the index sometimes the 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.810
 major sometimes the ring finger or 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:16.580
 the little finger let's keep the same chords 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.710
 but let's take another example the 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.580
 arpeggios when we play arts page 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.289
 we can still more easily 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.969
 benefit from this phenomenon 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:25.479
 since you are each notes 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:25.479
 individually 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.480
 let's just study the example of the do 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.100
 major as just now we will place 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:46.100
 in priority the ring finger to be able to 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:47.810
 start playing the basis of the agreement on 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.460
 so has a little respite before having to 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.210
 place the middle finger to play the second 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.979
 note 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:56.270
 the third note is a string 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:58.940
 empty so we are not in a hurry 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:02.660
 the next note is played with the index 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:04.100
 so here we have to place the index and the 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.370
 last note is the string acute to 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.199
 empty 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:11.530
 on this agreement often we have the reflex 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:13.000
 to start by placing the gold index here 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.410
 the ideal order of rights placement 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.040
 corresponds to the order in which we play 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:17.199
 the notes 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.350
 which amounts to placing the index in all 

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:19.350
 latest 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.409
 so of course if you manage to place 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.300
 all the fingers simultaneously it's 

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:27.800
 even better it is useless to force ourselves 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.270
 to place your fingers as you go 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.710
 if you get to place them all of one 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.500
 blow but for situations where 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.190
 the sequence of the present positions 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.229
 difficulties 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.909
 this method can help you 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:39.830
 put a little less pressure and to 

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:41.599
 allow you a little delay in the 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.280
 placement of the fingers by placing them so 

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:44.629
 as and when needed 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.860
 and when vacuum cords are 

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:47.240
 used it's even easier 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.139
 since it gives us time 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.970
 additional 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:51.500
 so it's interesting to ask yourself 

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.629
 question for each piece each 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.520
 rhythm where every arpeggio you play 

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:57.740
 knowing that the goal is always to 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.169
 promote fluidity and flexibility 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.580
 gold movements if you know you 

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:03.229
 have a little time in front of you for 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.080
 place the fingers there is a lot more 

00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:08.090
 easy to play in a relaxed way 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.409
 here I hope this trick you 

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.569
 will help in your guitar practice 

00:07:09.409 --> 00:07:13.219
 as always do not hesitate to leave 

00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:14.419
 your comments at the bottom of the article if 

00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:16.159
 you have questions or questions 

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:17.270
 particular difficulties or simply 

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:17.900
 that you want to share your 

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.569
 experience 

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:22.550
 and if you liked this video you were 

00:07:20.569 --> 00:07:24.080
 useful to think about sharing it about 

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.610
 social networks or guitar sites 

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.349
 that you frequent to do 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.639
 enjoy other guitarists 

00:07:27.349 --> 00:07:31.210
 as for me, I'll see you soon on 

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:31.210
 guitar instinct
