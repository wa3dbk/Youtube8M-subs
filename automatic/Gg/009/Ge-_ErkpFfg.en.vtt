00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 hello my name is Victoria in this 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.420
 video i want to tell you about my 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.580
 This small simplest dessert ki 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:11.670
 which I cook myself when I go out 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.099
 such a short 24 hour or 36 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.010
 hour fasting naturally first 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.869
 for breakfast 1 i have some 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.210
 freshly squeezed grapefruit juice or 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.369
 the orange for the second breakfast I already 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.400
 I'm preparing what 's so simple about it 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.410
 I do not really want to chew a banana 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.679
 what is the gentle and delicious texture 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.420
 so this simple option means 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.820
 we need an orange for 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.390
 fresh juice and a couple of bananas banana 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.760
 can i use one sometimes two this 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.100
 just it all depends on who is what 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.620
 consistency like either by the number and and 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.860
 thinner or thicker and sweeter 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.230
 from some let's say tools to us 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.449
 need a juicer to get it 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.280
 juice of it and a blender of such a plan 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:05.159
 something mean banana first thing i 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:08.930
 naturally just squeeze juice juice i 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.930
 squeezed out now that we need 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:23.520
 which is just peeling banana bananas i 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.650
 I prefer to take in general I love more 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.759
 green bananas here is how they go 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.189
 I don't like taste here at all but 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.860
 for this, I advise you to take them 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.980
 and not green and at the same time 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:42.750
 and have not yet appeared on them tochka 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:47.210
 they were not such more ripe kaplan 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:50.820
 further i just water that whole 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:55.050
 squeezed orange juice is about 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:58.920
 where is the floor of the glass is obtained juice well 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:05.010
 further simply using a blender 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:09.650
 I grind it all up so I grind it all 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.650
 turned out such a soft texture 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:18.060
 You can certainly take a spoonful of interesting 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.700
 shove here here to be honest when 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.940
 nice do this somehow boring could 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.940
 come 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:34.130
 tick to shift the creamer or rather even 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.130
 so pour there is a supplement but today 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:43.610
