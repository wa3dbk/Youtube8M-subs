 in love when I came to God 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.610

 creator of the site before four to full 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.450
 opening that allows many 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.190
 photographers to train themselves to the world of 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.520
 video photography and comes from 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.520
 workshops 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.820
 soledad is a series of photos that 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.689
 puts in its place the human in his more 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.250
 simple device in nature I 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.740
 ask me about the place of being 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.890
 human in today's society because 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.590
 this series I wanted to find again 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:52.409
 what I had and a child with the 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.020
 nature I spent my afternoons in the 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.189
 wood that is next to my parents' house 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.500
 and I wanted to go back to exploring 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.479
 of those beautiful places where nobody 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.860
 never set foot in this 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.209
 mind to go where no one is going 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.549
 I marveled at the force 

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:10.590
 cascades in front of thickets of 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:12.330
 foam I was able to find the pleasure of 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.519
 jump from rock to rock like 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.590
 I loved to do when I was little and 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.569
 always this little thing in mind I'm 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.489
 was saying that as soon as nature would like it 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:24.060
 as soon as I disrespect in fact 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:29.190
 to this nature she might not be me 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:31.650
 let go of the places in which 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.239
 I'm going I do not know them I 've got them 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.920
 just spotted on google earth 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.540
 I just saw pictures that others 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.730
 people could take and I do not know 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.620
 not too much what I will find there then 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:46.040
 just I take a model with me there 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.040
 go and we'll just wander 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.650
 once there I discover the place 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.650
 with child's eyes with eyes of 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.359
 of admiration and I'm actually looking 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.920
 the wonder is simply 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:01.260
 what happened with the picture we got it 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.950
 done today I went behind 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.750
 this waterfall 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.609
 I saw this sun against the light 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.370
 was hidden by this sugar loaf and 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:10.920
 blow that brought out all the 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.720
 drops of the waterfall and after I 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.810
 searched I searched for a position for 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.670
 Julian I was looking for exact framing 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.630
 I was trying to imagine the picture in my 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.490
 head 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.490
 Sebastian me we're back at home 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.870
 after this great shooting much more 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.270
 so here we are going to look a little bit 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.010
 he does fight or at least that the 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.060
 more interesting 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.120
 it was when I finished the shooting 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.040
 it was the photo I think I was going 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.790
 finally choose on the three that we 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.350
 did it was the picture I had chosen 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.510
 why that's what had me 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.130
 Provided the most emotions on moment 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.110
 during the shooting I also want to 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.080
 keep my gaze naive my gaze 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.520
 candid things because it's like 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.670
 that things come to me it's 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:57.040
 like that I can see them but I 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:00.340
 prefers to keep the psychological side the 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:03.310
 reflection side to the post prod part 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.420
 at home so of course sometimes I 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.410
 plant there are times I read you some 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.700
 things there are times I prepare players 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.530
 of the shooter his joy of the shooter like that 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.980
 and everything but it's part of me 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.670
 shooting 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:15.280
 it's part of it I can not think 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.959
 the photos are made during jogging 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.510
 I need to let myself be invaded by 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.470
 all the emotions ki moon I do not know 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.700
 not yet exactly what I 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.180
 understand this photo is too early 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.770
 for me to fake that lets him ripen he 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.030
 must you have us two weeks three 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.590
 weeks one month maybe three months 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.540
 I do not know to really understand 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.580
 why do I do that than she does 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.590
 expresses myself sees very well in this 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:40.300
 photo that there the right side is clogged 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:43.510
 that the right side the vault shares very 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.850
 quickly and we have no space we could 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.110
 space his side while there is a 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.910
 appearing under left side we have a 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.190
 opening semblance 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:54.610
 so he turns his back to the sides 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:56.890
 opening to the sides more more free 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.780
 maybe in addition there is this pic in the middle 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:02.460
 which really shows the distinction between 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:05.230
 the two places which side 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.610
 reassuring of the vault that protects but 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:10.180
 at the same time there is the very side 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.340
 withdrawn prisoner prisoners is going 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.370
 exactly 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:17.530
 in addition he is naked it make sense I think 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.850
 that he finally has the impression that 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.820
 shows that I have the impression that we see 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.440
 that it's a little cold there are all these 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.590
 drops of water there is this voyeur side 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.630
 also of the eye 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.550
 and by the side really prisoners here 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.740
 with the eye that looks at it but from the 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.890
 nature that tells him how you will not go out 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.890
 of the 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.990
 1
