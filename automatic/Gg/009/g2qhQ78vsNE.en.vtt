00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
thick line and then as it comes out it

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.420 
thick line and then as it comes out it
becomes<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.329> little<00:00:57.539> bit<00:00:57.809> thinner<00:00:58.230> there<00:00:59.160> we<00:00:59.280> go

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
becomes a little bit thinner there we go

becomes a little bit thinner there we go
like<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.899> then<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.410> thins<00:01:02.100> out<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:02.760> you

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
like this and then it thins out so you

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.660 
like this and then it thins out so you
start<00:01:03.390> off<00:01:03.539> thick<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.949> comes<00:01:05.220> thin

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670

some like swirly lines and this takes a

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.060 
some like swirly lines and this takes a

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.119 
little practice you shouldn't get
discouraged<00:02:05.250> at<00:02:05.969> first<00:02:06.380> but<00:02:07.380> once<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.799> get<00:02:07.950> it

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
discouraged at first but once you get it

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.290 
discouraged at first but once you get it
down<00:02:08.160> you'll<00:02:08.970> see<00:02:09.830> that<00:02:10.830> it's<00:02:11.069> not<00:02:11.340> quite<00:02:11.940> so

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
down you'll see that it's not quite so

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.360 
down you'll see that it's not quite so
difficult

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
difficult

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.250 
difficult
then<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.550> brush<00:02:14.879> like<00:02:15.090> this<00:02:15.120> too<00:02:15.569> can<00:02:15.750> also<00:02:15.959> get

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
then a brush like this too can also get

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.750 
then a brush like this too can also get
thicker<00:02:16.590> lines<00:02:16.950> so<00:02:17.280> you<00:02:17.340> want<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.700> just

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
thicker lines so you want to just

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.940 
thicker lines so you want to just
practice<00:02:18.150> using<00:02:18.720> different<00:02:19.290> weights<00:02:19.620> and

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
practice using different weights and

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.800 
practice using different weights and
different<00:02:22.099> ways<00:02:23.099> of<00:02:23.430> holding<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.180> brush<00:02:24.360> in

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
different ways of holding the brush in

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.690 
different ways of holding the brush in
order<00:02:25.410> to<00:02:25.560> create<00:02:25.830> all<00:02:26.129> these<00:02:26.370> different

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
order to create all these different

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.750 
order to create all these different
effects<00:02:27.769> this<00:02:28.769> is<00:02:28.830> jacqueline<00:02:29.400> laflamme
