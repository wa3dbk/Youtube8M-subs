hey<00:00:01.350> everybody<00:00:01.589> how<00:00:01.890> we<00:00:01.949> doing<00:00:02.280> today<00:00:02.510> today

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
hey everybody how we doing today today

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:04.610 
hey everybody how we doing today today
I'm<00:00:03.629> just<00:00:03.720> going<00:00:03.840> to<00:00:03.990> be<00:00:04.049> going<00:00:04.140> over<00:00:04.319> some<00:00:04.589> of

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
I'm just going to be going over some of

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.839 
I'm just going to be going over some of
just<00:00:04.890> the<00:00:05.210> basic<00:00:06.210> components<00:00:06.870> and<00:00:07.760> some<00:00:08.760> of

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
just the basic components and some of

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.310 
just the basic components and some of
the<00:00:08.940> way<00:00:09.059> things<00:00:09.120> works<00:00:09.570> in<00:00:09.780> some<00:00:09.960> things<00:00:10.170> that

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
the way things works in some things that

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.900 
the way things works in some things that
you<00:00:10.500> can<00:00:10.740> look<00:00:10.920> at<00:00:11.099> if<00:00:11.280> you're<00:00:11.370> ever<00:00:11.460> having<00:00:11.700> a

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
you can look at if you're ever having a

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.570 
you can look at if you're ever having a
problem<00:00:12.120> with<00:00:12.269> your<00:00:12.480> furnace<00:00:13.580> basically

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
problem with your furnace basically

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.129 
problem with your furnace basically
we'll<00:00:14.759> start<00:00:15.000> with<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.240> heating<00:00:15.450> components

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
we'll start with the heating components

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.650 
we'll start with the heating components
first<00:00:16.440> you've<00:00:17.369> got<00:00:17.550> your<00:00:17.730> inducer<00:00:18.150> fan<00:00:18.390> motor

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
first you've got your inducer fan motor

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.150 
first you've got your inducer fan motor
basically<00:00:19.199> when<00:00:19.320> you<00:00:19.410> get<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.590> call<00:00:19.800> from<00:00:19.980> your

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
basically when you get a call from your

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.679 
basically when you get a call from your
thermostat<00:00:20.699> for<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:20.939> call<00:00:21.180> for<00:00:21.359> heat<00:00:21.510> this

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
thermostat for a call for heat this

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.630 
thermostat for a call for heat this
should<00:00:21.869> start<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.230> spin<00:00:22.439> first<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:23.100> what<00:00:23.490> that

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
should start to spin first and what that

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.009 
should start to spin first and what that
does<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:24.150> actually<00:00:24.180> takes<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.810> heat

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
does is it actually takes the heat

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.500 
does is it actually takes the heat
exchanger<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:25.830> pulls<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.670> into<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.970> vacuum

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
exchanger and pulls it into a vacuum

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.830 
exchanger and pulls it into a vacuum
which<00:00:27.960> gives<00:00:28.199> your<00:00:28.410> efficiency<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.840> this

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
which gives your efficiency and this

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.310 
which gives your efficiency and this
this<00:00:31.170> starts<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.710> spin<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.309> then<00:00:33.170> that<00:00:34.170> makes

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
this starts to spin and then that makes

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.690 
this starts to spin and then that makes
something<00:00:34.590> called<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.920> pressure<00:00:35.160> switch<00:00:35.399> here

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
something called a pressure switch here

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.069 
something called a pressure switch here
and<00:00:35.790> what<00:00:35.880> this<00:00:36.000> pressure<00:00:36.270> switch<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.630> doing

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
and what this pressure switch is doing

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.590 
and what this pressure switch is doing
is<00:00:37.200> proving<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.760> actually<00:00:38.940> have<00:00:39.329> an<00:00:39.480> a

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
is proving that you actually have an a

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.049 
is proving that you actually have an a
an<00:00:40.020> induced<00:00:40.469> draft<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.670> venting

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
an induced draft so that it is venting

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.090 
an induced draft so that it is venting
correctly<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:42.899> if<00:00:43.320> this<00:00:43.469> pressure<00:00:43.739> switch

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
correctly and if this pressure switch

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.040 
correctly and if this pressure switch
doesn't<00:00:44.460> close<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:44.910> may<00:00:45.090> have<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.780> know<00:00:45.809> an

pressure switch that there is an induced

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.700 
pressure switch that there is an induced
draft<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:22.560> essentially<00:01:24.110> what<00:01:25.110> happens<00:01:25.500> next

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
draft so essentially what happens next

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.530 
draft so essentially what happens next
after<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.310> inducer<00:01:26.820> starts<00:01:27.119> running<00:01:27.390> in<00:01:27.420> the

after that inducer starts running in the
pressure<00:01:27.750> switch<00:01:27.960> makes<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:29.100> particular

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
pressure switch makes is this particular

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.749 
pressure switch makes is this particular
unit<00:01:29.909> has<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.439> hot<00:01:31.439> surface<00:01:31.740> ignition<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:32.610> it

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
unit has a hot surface ignition in it

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.929 
unit has a hot surface ignition in it
and<00:01:32.939> basically<00:01:33.540> it's<00:01:34.020> an<00:01:34.170> element<00:01:34.790> it's<00:01:35.790> just

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
and basically it's an element it's just

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.219 
and basically it's an element it's just
120<00:01:36.600> volts<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.110> heats<00:01:37.290> up<00:01:37.579> and<00:01:39.079> then<00:01:40.079> from

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
120 volts and it heats up and then from

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.160 
120 volts and it heats up and then from
there<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.950> gas<00:01:41.159> valve<00:01:41.490> opens<00:01:42.119> up<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.540> it

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
there the gas valve opens up and it

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.990 
there the gas valve opens up and it
ignites<00:01:43.500> against<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.130> ignites<00:01:44.520> against<00:01:44.909> the

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
ignites against it ignites against the

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.310 
ignites against it ignites against the
igniter<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.600> then<00:01:45.960> there's<00:01:46.140> something

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
igniter and then there's something

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.679 
igniter and then there's something
called<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.680> flame<00:01:46.920> sensor<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.610> know<00:01:48.420> if<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.570> guys

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
called a flame sensor I know if you guys

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.280 
called a flame sensor I know if you guys
can<00:01:48.930> see<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.200> back<00:01:49.350> there<00:01:50.869> this<00:01:51.869> little<00:01:52.049> rod

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
can see it back there this little rod

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.810 
can see it back there this little rod
sticking<00:01:52.590> up<00:01:52.920> back<00:01:53.130> here<00:01:53.310> that's<00:01:53.549> called<00:01:53.700> the

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
sticking up back here that's called the

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.810 
sticking up back here that's called the
flame<00:01:54.060> sensor<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:55.070> that<00:01:56.070> picks<00:01:56.369> up<00:01:56.579> the

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
flame sensor and that picks up the

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.749 
flame sensor and that picks up the
actual<00:01:57.149> energy<00:01:57.890> picked<00:01:58.890> up<00:01:59.070> off<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.490> flame

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
actual energy picked up off the flame

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.630 
actual energy picked up off the flame
and<00:02:00.380> reports<00:02:01.380> back<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.799> control<00:02:02.130> board<00:02:02.399> to

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
and reports back to the control board to

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.490 
and reports back to the control board to
prove<00:02:02.880> flame<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.420> if<00:02:03.540> that's<00:02:03.750> clean<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.110> lot<00:02:04.320> of

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
prove flame and if that's clean a lot of

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.899 
prove flame and if that's clean a lot of
times<00:02:04.680> you<00:02:04.829> can<00:02:04.979> take<00:02:05.009> this<00:02:05.280> out<00:02:05.490> with<00:02:05.640> just<00:02:05.820> a

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
times you can take this out with just a

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.819 
times you can take this out with just a
quarter<00:02:06.210> inch<00:02:06.390> screw<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:06.990> just<00:02:07.409> clean<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.619> up

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
quarter inch screw and just clean it up

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.580 
quarter inch screw and just clean it up
with<00:02:08.009> some<00:02:08.250> fine<00:02:08.459> sandpaper<00:02:09.379> Emery<00:02:10.379> cloth

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
with some fine sandpaper Emery cloth

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.190 
with some fine sandpaper Emery cloth
possibly<00:02:11.370> it's<00:02:12.330> usually<00:02:12.569> not<00:02:12.750> too<00:02:12.870> difficult

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
possibly it's usually not too difficult

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.820 
possibly it's usually not too difficult
I<00:02:13.530> tried

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
I tried

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.380 
I tried
they<00:02:13.980> use<00:02:14.130> an<00:02:14.250> emery<00:02:14.520> cloth<00:02:14.640> and<00:02:15.000> if<00:02:15.090> you<00:02:15.210> do

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
they use an emery cloth and if you do

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.230 
they use an emery cloth and if you do
use<00:02:15.600> sandpaper<00:02:15.960> make<00:02:16.830> sure<00:02:17.010> that<00:02:17.220> you<00:02:17.370> remove

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
use sandpaper make sure that you remove

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.390 
use sandpaper make sure that you remove
all<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.510> excess<00:02:18.660> san<00:02:19.260> fermin<00:02:19.620> wipe<00:02:19.770> wipe<00:02:20.190> the

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
all the excess san fermin wipe wipe the

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.740 
all the excess san fermin wipe wipe the
rod<00:02:20.580> down<00:02:20.790> really<00:02:21.030> well<00:02:21.150> when<00:02:21.390> you're<00:02:21.570> done

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
rod down really well when you're done

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.150 
rod down really well when you're done
that<00:02:21.990> would<00:02:22.170> because<00:02:22.410> we<00:02:22.530> all<00:02:22.680> know<00:02:22.830> that<00:02:22.860> Sam

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
that would because we all know that Sam

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.620 
that would because we all know that Sam
turns<00:02:23.430> into<00:02:23.580> glass<00:02:23.820> when<00:02:24.090> it's<00:02:24.210> heated<00:02:24.360> and

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
turns into glass when it's heated and

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.390 
turns into glass when it's heated and
it'll<00:02:24.840> also<00:02:25.020> give<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:25.410> a<00:02:25.470> false<00:02:25.710> reading<00:02:26.010> um<00:02:28.400> so

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
it'll also give it a false reading um so

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.010 
it'll also give it a false reading um so
that's<00:02:29.520> basically<00:02:29.700> how<00:02:30.090> that<00:02:30.360> works<00:02:30.660> and<00:02:30.870> then

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
that's basically how that works and then

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.140 
that's basically how that works and then
obviously<00:02:31.470> as<00:02:32.100> long<00:02:32.280> as<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.490> proofs<00:02:32.730> flame<00:02:32.970> it

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
obviously as long as the proofs flame it

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.540 
obviously as long as the proofs flame it
will<00:02:33.240> continue<00:02:33.510> to<00:02:33.750> run<00:02:33.960> but<00:02:34.200> you<00:02:34.890> know<00:02:35.040> then

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
will continue to run but you know then

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.920 
will continue to run but you know then
there's<00:02:35.730> other<00:02:35.910> safeties<00:02:36.360> also<00:02:36.780> you've<00:02:37.380> got<00:02:37.650> a

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
there's other safeties also you've got a

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.170 
there's other safeties also you've got a
high<00:02:39.930> limit<00:02:40.380> switch<00:02:40.410> up<00:02:40.830> here<00:02:41.100> that<00:02:41.730> if<00:02:41.940> you

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
high limit switch up here that if you

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.120 
high limit switch up here that if you
know<00:02:42.330> it<00:02:42.510> were<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:42.960> stop<00:02:43.320> the<00:02:43.530> inducer<00:02:43.920> fan

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
know it were to stop the inducer fan

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.880 
know it were to stop the inducer fan
motor<00:02:44.370> worst<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:45.000> stop<00:02:45.240> running<00:02:45.720> you<00:02:46.350> know<00:02:46.500> it

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
motor worst to stop running you know it

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.500 
motor worst to stop running you know it
still<00:02:47.460> thinks<00:02:47.760> that<00:02:47.790> it's<00:02:48.060> burning<00:02:48.390> and

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
still thinks that it's burning and

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.970 
still thinks that it's burning and
everything<00:02:48.840> is<00:02:48.930> running<00:02:49.140> okay<00:02:49.530> because<00:02:49.830> the

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
everything is running okay because the

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.660 
everything is running okay because the
pressure<00:02:50.190> switch<00:02:50.580> is<00:02:50.610> already<00:02:51.120> made<00:02:51.420> so

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
pressure switch is already made so

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.920 
pressure switch is already made so
basically<00:02:53.670> this<00:02:53.820> is<00:02:53.880> resettable<00:02:54.510> if<00:02:54.720> you<00:02:54.840> have

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
basically this is resettable if you have

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.720 
basically this is resettable if you have
a<00:02:54.959> problem<00:02:55.230> or<00:02:55.530> something<00:02:55.680> in<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.070> fluid<00:02:56.340> or

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
a problem or something in the fluid or

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.390 
a problem or something in the fluid or
basically<00:02:57.480> any<00:02:57.720> problem<00:02:58.170> in<00:02:58.290> it<00:02:58.410> it's<00:02:59.160> going

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
basically any problem in it it's going

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.550 
basically any problem in it it's going
to<00:02:59.430> show<00:02:59.670> now<00:03:00.270> typically<00:03:00.690> a<00:03:00.810> lot<00:03:01.050> of<00:03:01.140> furnaces

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
to show now typically a lot of furnaces

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.040 
to show now typically a lot of furnaces
will<00:03:01.740> actually<00:03:02.100> have<00:03:02.250> something<00:03:02.490> called<00:03:02.640> a

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
will actually have something called a

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.840 
will actually have something called a
flame<00:03:04.050> rollout<00:03:04.500> switch<00:03:04.830> which<00:03:05.040> I<00:03:05.280> can't<00:03:05.640> seem

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
flame rollout switch which I can't seem

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.340 
flame rollout switch which I can't seem
to<00:03:05.970> find<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.300> one<00:03:06.450> on<00:03:06.570> this<00:03:06.780> one<00:03:06.959> right<00:03:07.110> now

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
to find the one on this one right now

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.500 
to find the one on this one right now
but<00:03:09.050> that's<00:03:10.050> okay<00:03:10.790> it's<00:03:11.790> not<00:03:11.940> something<00:03:12.150> to<00:03:12.390> be

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
but that's okay it's not something to be

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.440 
but that's okay it's not something to be
too<00:03:12.690> concerned<00:03:13.080> about<00:03:13.970> then<00:03:14.970> you<00:03:15.090> come<00:03:15.240> down

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
too concerned about then you come down

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.699 
too concerned about then you come down
here<00:03:15.660> to<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:15.930> blower<00:03:16.140> motor<00:03:16.380> and<00:03:16.620> the

you're<00:03:32.459> going<00:03:32.580> to<00:03:32.640> have<00:03:32.790> a<00:03:32.820> high<00:03:33.090> a<00:03:33.450> medium

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
you're going to have a high a medium

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.340 
you're going to have a high a medium
high<00:03:34.410> medium<00:03:35.280> low<00:03:35.310> and<00:03:35.489> a<00:03:35.790> low<00:03:36.000> and<00:03:36.350> typically

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
high medium low and a low and typically

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.080 
high medium low and a low and typically
they<00:03:37.590> set<00:03:37.830> it<00:03:37.860> up<00:03:38.100> to<00:03:38.250> where<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.550> high<00:03:38.730> is

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
they set it up to where the high is

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.509 
they set it up to where the high is
going<00:03:39.780> to<00:03:39.870> be<00:03:39.989> the<00:03:40.200> is<00:03:40.470> going<00:03:41.190> to<00:03:41.280> be<00:03:41.400> the

going to be the is going to be the

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.520 
going to be the is going to be the
cooling<00:03:41.850> speed<00:03:42.090> and<00:03:42.239> also<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.660> speed<00:03:42.959> that

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
cooling speed and also the speed that

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.009 
cooling speed and also the speed that
they're<00:03:43.800> going<00:03:43.920> to<00:03:44.040> utilize<00:03:44.280> when<00:03:44.670> you<00:03:44.760> have<00:03:44.940> a

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
they're going to utilize when you have a

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.920 
they're going to utilize when you have a
continuous<00:03:46.019> fan<00:03:46.260> call<00:03:46.560> from<00:03:46.769> your<00:03:46.920> thermostat

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
continuous fan call from your thermostat

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.509 
continuous fan call from your thermostat
there's<00:03:48.930> usually<00:03:49.080> two<00:03:49.470> two<00:03:49.830> or<00:03:50.040> three<00:03:50.280> wires

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
there's usually two two or three wires

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.790 
there's usually two two or three wires
they<00:03:50.790> don't<00:03:50.970> use<00:03:51.269> a<00:03:51.510> spare<00:03:52.170> one<00:03:52.350> and<00:03:52.500> a<00:03:52.560> spare

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
they don't use a spare one and a spare

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.220 
they don't use a spare one and a spare
to<00:03:52.980> that<00:03:53.190> be<00:03:53.310> like<00:03:53.489> your<00:03:53.670> medium<00:03:54.090> low<00:03:54.360> or<00:03:54.720> your

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
to that be like your medium low or your

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.229 
to that be like your medium low or your
medium<00:03:55.620> high<00:03:55.800> and<00:03:55.830> your<00:03:56.160> low<00:03:56.370> because<00:03:56.940> they're

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
medium high and your low because they're

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:58.850 
medium high and your low because they're
going<00:03:57.360> to<00:03:57.420> use<00:03:57.450> a<00:03:57.600> medium<00:03:57.900> high<00:03:58.230> for<00:03:58.530> heat<00:03:58.739> and

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
going to use a medium high for heat and

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.160 
going to use a medium high for heat and
then<00:03:59.100> high<00:03:59.340> for<00:03:59.610> cooling<00:04:00.000> so<00:04:00.600> the<00:04:00.780> other<00:04:00.930> two

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
then high for cooling so the other two

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.810 
then high for cooling so the other two
are<00:04:01.200> unused<00:04:01.709> but<00:04:01.980> if<00:04:02.070> you<00:04:02.160> needed<00:04:02.459> to<00:04:02.489> increase

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
are unused but if you needed to increase

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.370 
are unused but if you needed to increase
or<00:04:03.090> decrease<00:04:03.239> your<00:04:03.480> airflow<00:04:03.989> you<00:04:04.110> could

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
or decrease your airflow you could

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.229 
or decrease your airflow you could
always<00:04:04.590> change<00:04:04.800> it<00:04:04.980> on<00:04:05.130> the<00:04:05.190> Spade<00:04:05.760> terminal

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
always change it on the Spade terminal

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.699 
always change it on the Spade terminal
there<00:04:08.450> obviously<00:04:09.450> you<00:04:09.840> can<00:04:10.019> see<00:04:10.230> where<00:04:10.470> the

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
there obviously you can see where the

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.970 
there obviously you can see where the
thermostat<00:04:11.190> connections<00:04:11.700> are<00:04:11.880> made<00:04:12.709> to<00:04:13.709> go

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
thermostat connections are made to go

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.199 
thermostat connections are made to go
ahead<00:04:14.070> and<00:04:14.280> go<00:04:14.370> through<00:04:14.400> all<00:04:14.610> the<00:04:14.760> circuitry

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
ahead and go through all the circuitry

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.060 
ahead and go through all the circuitry
to<00:04:15.420> tell<00:04:15.660> to<00:04:16.049> tell<00:04:16.260> the<00:04:16.380> furnace<00:04:16.709> actually

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
to tell to tell the furnace actually

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.020 
to tell to tell the furnace actually
what<00:04:17.280> to<00:04:17.430> do<00:04:19.160> there's<00:04:20.160> your<00:04:20.280> 24<00:04:20.820> volt

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
what to do there's your 24 volt

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.029 
what to do there's your 24 volt
transformer<00:04:21.410> that's<00:04:22.410> going<00:04:22.620> to<00:04:22.680> a<00:04:22.710> lot<00:04:22.919> of

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
transformer that's going to a lot of

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:24.830 
transformer that's going to a lot of
times<00:04:23.250> that<00:04:23.400> powers<00:04:23.729> up<00:04:23.880> your<00:04:24.000> thermostat<00:04:24.570> is

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
times that powers up your thermostat is

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.470 
times that powers up your thermostat is
what<00:04:25.470> actually<00:04:25.860> allows<00:04:26.640> the<00:04:27.000> flow<00:04:27.240> of

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
what actually allows the flow of

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.690 
what actually allows the flow of
24<00:04:27.870> volts<00:04:28.230> to<00:04:28.380> start<00:04:28.650> on<00:04:28.800> the<00:04:28.920> our<00:04:29.100> leg<00:04:29.430> and

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
24 volts to start on the our leg and

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.090 
24 volts to start on the our leg and
then<00:04:30.060> your<00:04:30.240> thermostat<00:04:30.780> takes<00:04:31.050> that<00:04:31.230> 24<00:04:31.770> volts

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
then your thermostat takes that 24 volts

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.190 
then your thermostat takes that 24 volts
and<00:04:32.190> it<00:04:32.310> switches<00:04:32.550> it<00:04:32.910> to<00:04:32.940> you<00:04:33.120> know<00:04:33.300> why<00:04:33.510> or<00:04:33.810> w

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
and it switches it to you know why or w

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.480 
and it switches it to you know why or w
depending<00:04:34.620> on<00:04:34.740> what<00:04:34.890> is<00:04:34.980> trying<00:04:35.220> to<00:04:35.310> make<00:04:35.430> a

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
depending on what is trying to make a

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.340 
depending on what is trying to make a
call<00:04:35.820> for<00:04:36.090> you<00:04:36.690> know<00:04:36.840> if<00:04:36.960> it<00:04:37.050> were<00:04:37.110> to<00:04:37.200> take

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
call for you know if it were to take

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:44.450 
call for you know if it were to take
that<00:04:37.560> that<00:04:38.430> are<00:04:39.090> and<00:04:39.450> flip<00:04:40.440> it<00:04:40.560> to<00:04:43.460> possibly

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
that that are and flip it to possibly

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.780 
that that are and flip it to possibly
why<00:04:44.910> it<00:04:45.840> would<00:04:45.990> flip<00:04:46.200> it<00:04:46.320> to<00:04:46.350> Y<00:04:46.650> and<00:04:46.920> G<00:04:47.010> if<00:04:47.490> it

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
why it would flip it to Y and G if it

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.070 
why it would flip it to Y and G if it
wanted<00:04:48.030> to<00:04:48.120> call<00:04:48.270> for<00:04:48.450> cooling<00:04:48.750> and<00:04:48.900> it<00:04:48.990> would

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
wanted to call for cooling and it would

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.390 
wanted to call for cooling and it would
flip<00:04:49.260> it<00:04:49.380> to<00:04:49.410> W<00:04:49.890> if<00:04:49.980> it<00:04:50.130> 12<00:04:50.460> call<00:04:50.670> for<00:04:50.910> heat

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
flip it to W if it 12 call for heat

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.010 
flip it to W if it 12 call for heat
that's<00:04:53.400> basically<00:04:53.880> the<00:04:54.000> basics<00:04:54.120> on<00:04:54.630> how<00:04:54.660> this

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
that's basically the basics on how this

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.540 
that's basically the basics on how this
work<00:04:55.200> obviously<00:04:55.440> probably<00:04:56.130> noticed<00:04:56.400> that<00:04:56.430> you

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
work obviously probably noticed that you

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.250 
work obviously probably noticed that you
have<00:04:56.640> a<00:04:56.670> door<00:04:56.910> switch<00:04:57.180> here<00:04:57.480> so<00:04:58.080> you<00:04:58.140> always

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
have a door switch here so you always

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.200 
have a door switch here so you always
want<00:04:58.350> to<00:04:58.500> make<00:04:58.620> sure<00:04:58.680> that<00:04:58.980> a<00:04:59.250> lot<00:04:59.760> of<00:04:59.880> times<00:05:00.060> I

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
want to make sure that a lot of times I

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.730 
want to make sure that a lot of times I
see<00:05:00.360> older<00:05:00.630> equipment<00:05:00.840> where<00:05:01.260> some<00:05:01.410> guys<00:05:01.560> have

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
see older equipment where some guys have

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.680 
see older equipment where some guys have
came<00:05:01.950> through<00:05:02.190> and<00:05:02.310> hacked<00:05:02.550> it<00:05:02.730> off<00:05:02.880> and<00:05:03.240> you

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
came through and hacked it off and you

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:04.940 
came through and hacked it off and you
know<00:05:03.810> can<00:05:03.960> we<00:05:04.080> really<00:05:04.290> always<00:05:04.470> say<00:05:04.770> if<00:05:04.830> you

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
know can we really always say if you

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.170 
know can we really always say if you
always<00:05:05.070> want<00:05:05.340> to<00:05:05.370> make<00:05:05.490> sure<00:05:05.550> that<00:05:05.940> you<00:05:06.030> know

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
always want to make sure that you know

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.000 
always want to make sure that you know

this<00:05:19.560> is<00:05:19.710> your<00:05:19.830> main<00:05:19.950> high<00:05:20.160> limit<00:05:20.460> on<00:05:20.550> the<00:05:20.700> heat

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
this is your main high limit on the heat

back here is your other high limit once
again<00:05:29.550> it's<00:05:29.730> just<00:05:29.880> 24<00:05:30.360> volts<00:05:30.660> goes<00:05:30.810> through

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
again it's just 24 volts goes through

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.420 
again it's just 24 volts goes through
there<00:05:31.230> and<00:05:31.380> if<00:05:31.470> there's<00:05:31.650> a<00:05:31.710> problem<00:05:31.980> it<00:05:32.220> breaks

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
there and if there's a problem it breaks

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.910 
there and if there's a problem it breaks
it<00:05:32.670> reports<00:05:33.360> back<00:05:33.480> to<00:05:33.690> the<00:05:33.810> board<00:05:34.080> and<00:05:34.260> shuts

it reports back to the board and shuts

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:40.640 
it reports back to the board and shuts
it<00:05:35.070> off<00:05:38.810> like<00:05:39.810> I<00:05:39.930> said<00:05:40.110> I've<00:05:40.230> done<00:05:40.410> a<00:05:40.440> couple

problem with heat the first thing to

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.480 
problem with heat the first thing to
always<00:06:06.660> check<00:06:07.050> is<00:06:07.290> check<00:06:07.830> that<00:06:08.010> flame<00:06:08.220> sensor

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490 
always check is check that flame sensor

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:09.680 
always check is check that flame sensor
and<00:06:08.700> clean<00:06:08.850> it<00:06:08.970> especially<00:06:09.270> if<00:06:09.510> it's<00:06:09.630> short

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690 
and clean it especially if it's short

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.370 
and clean it especially if it's short
cycling<00:06:10.170> it<00:06:10.560> seems<00:06:11.130> to<00:06:11.220> be<00:06:11.280> coming<00:06:11.370> off<00:06:11.820> and<00:06:12.090> on

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:12.380

cycling it seems to be coming off and on
at<00:06:13.380> lice<00:06:13.650> and<00:06:13.680> then<00:06:14.070> it<00:06:14.190> turns<00:06:14.400> off<00:06:14.960> second

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
at lice and then it turns off second

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.750 
at lice and then it turns off second
thing<00:06:16.080> would<00:06:16.230> be<00:06:16.350> the<00:06:16.500> igniter<00:06:17.180> which<00:06:18.180> is<00:06:19.760> know

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:20.760 
thing would be the igniter which is know

if you can see it back here right here
right<00:06:26.900> here<00:06:27.900> I<00:06:28.080> got<00:06:28.230> my<00:06:28.320> finger<00:06:28.620> on<00:06:28.650> it<00:06:28.770> that's

right here I got my finger on it that's

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.650 
right here I got my finger on it that's
the<00:06:29.130> igniter<00:06:29.430> now<00:06:29.940> they<00:06:30.090> don't<00:06:30.210> always<00:06:30.510> have
