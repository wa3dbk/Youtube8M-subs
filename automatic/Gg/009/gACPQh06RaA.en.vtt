00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:18.310
 hi to all these pegasus artists we get 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.190
 found again for a video 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.900
 a bit special because 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:24.460
 today we find ourselves on this club 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.470
 and it's true that on this part 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.259
 down I took my eyes a big sheet 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.610
 by someone and I thought 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:31.930
 this is weird I expected 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.760
 but a big sheet by this person 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.620
 we will watch how I like to do 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.360
 in the studio down we will resume his 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.880
 part and we'll look at it a little bit 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.710
 did and he did a big part of 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.880
 crazy a big part of phew so 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.650
 exceptionally low I go there 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.160
 commented what you will see that that 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:50.380
 is going to be a big time a big time and 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.600
 I think hard but the guy gotha 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.700
 everyone 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.510
 Well, that's the competition 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.460
 should take some seed 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.920
 did he really play a 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.740
 m way look a little bit this 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.350
 precision to it is a little leer its 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.150
 beginning but will quickly rebuild the 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.049
 look to find a corner a little 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.729
 Strategic place where see made 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:14.890
 movements up and down it's a little 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.219
 of the gym that does for a little bit 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.890
 muscle up the flares to warm up in 

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:24.549
 a very good idea to him he waits bah 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:27.280
 here is a friend most definitely at kwixo 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:29.079
 foot can help him and the head shot is 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.840
 hot shot in the head so that's it 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:33.939
 really very very well done here 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.619
 second and schott it unlocks in addition 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.359
 armored bullet so here I mean to 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.569
 yves dexterity bot look look 

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:42.039
 he shoots next but he refused but 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:44.310
 really close 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:48.759
 he is not afraid to take risks 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.409
 to slip behind his enemy there from 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.090
 to really hide this project is very 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.520
 well it's going very fast 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.979
 it's going very fast it unblocks bloodthirsty 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.749
 oh there he is the drones so that's 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.359
 played really well where he looks at his 

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:02.600
 strategic place and balance the package oh 

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:05.240
 there but as if 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.280
 play look like he pulls and really 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.140
 he has a precision this guy he has a 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.759
 foolproof precision because there is 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.230
 very few bullets coming next to 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:16.610
 every ball touches his team and that's 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.630
 true that it's really one of 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.200
 best parts I have a 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:25.040
 good so it's amazing I think 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.569
 diaboliks 9 and mister the v12 must be 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.120
 have to watch this video for 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.790
 learn from the master that says 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.319
 oh fucking vidic if in a row without mercy 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.940
 really it's the beginning of the game 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.310
 to be 28 17 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.870
 it's still one that he really 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.120
 it's really abused and what dexterity 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.730
 and that's with the mps is silent 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.590
 must who does know and schott and to 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.090
 every time he does not miss his target and 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.290
 it's always in the head so 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.840
 it is true that it is very rare to have 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.090
 a part with hot shots meola 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.940
 the missing aipute he really arrived 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:59.750
 revised right away so there really very 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.370
 well played again to him I think it 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.510
 must be someone who has to make a 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.040
 who has to do all the competition 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.590
 just because it's one of 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.920
 best player in the world of 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.769
 code 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.079
 so this thriller binds her and blogs sergeant 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:14.030
 jacques mellick united the camouflage then 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.079
 there we will accelerate a little bit down because 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.500
 it's not that it's boring but when 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:22.040
 even it's a little bit so having 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:25.750
 Here it is incredible party 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:28.519
 unleashes everything in speed but maddening 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.580
 these bins is repetitive 1 are two steps 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.680
 at all 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.990
 all very buoyant and look at it is 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.820
 finished it explodes everyone with a 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.920
 score of 31 to 1 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.420
 and I'm going to make a poor man 10.11 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.100
 because I actually did not take 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.670
 everything he had swayed in full 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.590
 head 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.110
 so all the strategic package and that's 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.580
 so congratulations to him bravo I applaud 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.070

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.930
