hero<00:00:29.429> growing<00:00:29.640> up<00:00:29.910> was<00:00:30.090> probably<00:00:30.359> Stephen

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
hero growing up was probably Stephen

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.220 
hero growing up was probably Stephen
Larkin<00:00:31.460> as<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.520> fly<00:00:32.790> off<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.360> kind<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.079> always

Larkin as a fly off and kind of always

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.450 
Larkin as a fly off and kind of always
been<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.469> flyer<00:00:34.680> since<00:00:34.980> been<00:00:35.130> younger

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
been a flyer since been younger

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.700 
been a flyer since been younger
obviously<00:00:36.420> him<00:00:36.600> being<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:37.110> while<00:00:37.260> we<00:00:37.380> fly<00:00:37.500> off

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
obviously him being the while we fly off

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.740 
obviously him being the while we fly off
and<00:00:37.860> for<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.070> good<00:00:38.489> time<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:39.239> was<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.450> really<00:00:39.570> good

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
and for a good time it was a really good

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.560 
and for a good time it was a really good
example<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.820> reckon<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:41.910> have<00:00:42.030> probably

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
example and I reckon I have probably

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.450 
example and I reckon I have probably
similar<00:00:42.840> risk<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.410> him<00:00:43.590> with<00:00:43.890> nothing<00:00:44.010> you

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
similar risk to him with nothing you

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.180 
similar risk to him with nothing you
know<00:00:44.700> genetically<00:00:45.660> perfect<00:00:46.230> no<00:00:46.770> not<00:00:46.980> great

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190

speed or agility or strength or power

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.529 
speed or agility or strength or power
it's<00:00:49.829> more<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.610> ability<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:50.969> understand<00:00:51.449> the

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
it's more the ability to understand the

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.389 
it's more the ability to understand the
game<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:52.050> read<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.320> game<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.710> control<00:00:53.070> and

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
game and read the game and control and

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.610 
game and read the game and control and
how<00:00:53.699> an<00:00:54.390> individual<00:00:54.870> can<00:00:54.930> have<00:00:55.050> such<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.379> big

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
how an individual can have such a big

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.380 
how an individual can have such a big
influence<00:00:55.920> on<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.219> outcome<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.969> game<00:00:57.120> so

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
influence on the outcome of the game so

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.849 
influence on the outcome of the game so
that's<00:00:57.719> probably<00:00:57.870> my<00:00:57.989> hero<00:00:58.230> a<00:01:00.590> big<00:01:01.590> sports

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
that's probably my hero a big sports

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.850 
that's probably my hero a big sports
start<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.340> fans<00:01:02.699> right<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.239> probably<00:01:03.860> people

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
start of fans right so probably people

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.410 
start of fans right so probably people
that<00:01:05.070> have<00:01:05.159> been<00:01:05.460> really<00:01:05.519> successful<00:01:05.850> in

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
that have been really successful in

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.490 
that have been really successful in
their<00:01:06.510> field<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:06.900> probably<00:01:07.170> someone<00:01:07.409> like

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
their field so probably someone like

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.530 
their field so probably someone like
Michael<00:01:07.710> Jordan<00:01:08.159> would<00:01:08.430> be<00:01:08.549> amazing<00:01:08.939> just<00:01:09.090> to

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
Michael Jordan would be amazing just to

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.899 
Michael Jordan would be amazing just to
be<00:01:10.290> around<00:01:10.530> his<00:01:10.770> aura<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.610> then<00:01:11.790> probably

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
be around his aura and then probably

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.640 
be around his aura and then probably
Roger<00:01:12.150> Federer<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.840> then<00:01:13.200> probably<00:01:13.350> like

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
Roger Federer and then probably like

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.469 
Roger Federer and then probably like
Miranda<00:01:14.130> Kerr<00:01:14.280> just<00:01:14.520> for<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.700> company

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.429 

probably<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.630> loudest<00:01:18.840> one<00:01:19.020> in<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.290> room

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
probably is the loudest one in the room

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.710 
probably is the loudest one in the room
I<00:01:19.770> mean<00:01:20.340> when<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.150> don't<00:01:21.330> know<00:01:21.479> me<00:01:21.659> I'm

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
probably pretty quiet and reserved but

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.570 
probably pretty quiet and reserved but
when<00:01:25.140> I'm<00:01:25.229> comfort<00:01:25.590> with<00:01:25.680> people<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.070> think<00:01:26.189> I

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.780 

one<00:01:38.410> thing<00:01:38.590> is<00:01:38.680> probably<00:01:38.830> that<00:01:39.070> if<00:01:39.220> I<00:01:39.460> do<00:01:39.520> get

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
one thing is probably that if I do get

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.280 
one thing is probably that if I do get
on<00:01:39.910> the<00:01:39.970> fields<00:01:40.240> of<00:01:40.330> super<00:01:40.570> ivory<00:01:40.810> player<00:01:41.020> I'll

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
on the fields of super ivory player I'll

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.670 
on the fields of super ivory player I'll
be<00:01:41.530> the<00:01:41.650> first<00:01:41.830> Jewish<00:01:42.670> rugby<00:01:43.330> player<00:01:43.540> I<00:01:43.780> don't

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
be the first Jewish rugby player I don't

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.680 
be the first Jewish rugby player I don't
think<00:01:44.800> there's<00:01:44.920> been<00:01:45.040> any<00:01:45.570> super<00:01:46.570> rugby

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
think there's been any super rugby

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.180 
think there's been any super rugby
players<00:01:46.960> weather<00:01:47.290> here<00:01:47.530> in<00:01:47.620> Australia<00:01:48.040> and

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
players weather here in Australia and

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.800 
players weather here in Australia and
I'm<00:01:48.610> pretty<00:01:48.850> surprised<00:01:49.150> that's<00:01:49.330> not<00:01:49.510> it

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
I'm pretty surprised that's not it

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.030 
I'm pretty surprised that's not it
hasn't<00:01:50.140> been<00:01:50.200> more<00:01:50.320> common<00:01:50.530> in<00:01:50.680> South<00:01:50.800> Africa

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
hasn't been more common in South Africa

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.400 
hasn't been more common in South Africa
because<00:01:51.190> there<00:01:51.340> are<00:01:51.430> a<00:01:51.460> lot<00:01:51.610> of<00:01:52.260> Jewish<00:01:53.260> people

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
because there are a lot of Jewish people

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.590 
because there are a lot of Jewish people
that<00:01:53.740> live<00:01:53.890> there<00:01:54.100> but<00:01:54.280> the<00:01:55.119> first<00:01:55.330> probably

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
it's definitely the best thing about

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.750 
it's definitely the best thing about
being<00:03:55.410> here<00:03:55.740> knowing<00:03:56.040> that<00:03:56.100> success<00:03:56.580> is<00:03:56.730> a

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
being here knowing that success is a

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.309 
being here knowing that success is a
real<00:03:57.000> possibility<00:03:59.720> it<00:04:00.720> was<00:04:00.840> probably<00:04:00.990> being

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
real possibility it was probably being

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.590 
real possibility it was probably being
left<00:04:01.740> out<00:04:01.920> of<00:04:02.130> my<00:04:02.610> final<00:04:03.090> involvement<00:04:03.510> with

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
left out of my final involvement with

New<00:04:09.510> Zealand<00:04:09.600> and<00:04:09.959> Fiji<00:04:10.340> and<00:04:11.340> I<00:04:11.400> wasn't<00:04:11.670> picked

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
New Zealand and Fiji and I wasn't picked

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.160 
New Zealand and Fiji and I wasn't picked
for<00:04:11.940> that<00:04:12.060> and<00:04:12.270> they<00:04:12.480> decided<00:04:12.840> to<00:04:12.930> go<00:04:13.050> with

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
for that and they decided to go with

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.190 
for that and they decided to go with
someone<00:04:13.350> else<00:04:13.590> I<00:04:14.250> mean<00:04:14.760> at<00:04:14.850> the<00:04:14.940> time<00:04:15.109> you<00:04:16.109> know

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
someone else I mean at the time you know

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.210 
someone else I mean at the time you know
you're<00:04:16.350> really<00:04:16.500> disappointed<00:04:16.680> especially

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
you're really disappointed especially

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.470 
you're really disappointed especially
because<00:04:17.579> that's<00:04:17.820> like<00:04:17.940> the<00:04:18.060> last<00:04:18.209> thing

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
because that's like the last thing

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.580 
because that's like the last thing
you'll<00:04:18.600> have<00:04:18.720> involvement<00:04:19.200> with<00:04:19.380> school

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
you'll have involvement with school

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:20.870 
you'll have involvement with school
footy<00:04:19.769> and<00:04:19.859> with<00:04:20.070> your<00:04:20.190> mates<00:04:20.400> going<00:04:20.640> on<00:04:20.760> -

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
footy and with your mates going on -

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.740 
footy and with your mates going on -
I've<00:04:21.000> never<00:04:21.090> really<00:04:21.209> done<00:04:21.510> that

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
I've never really done that

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.659 
I've never really done that
it's<00:04:22.019> especially<00:04:22.230> internationally<00:04:22.980> so

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
it's especially internationally so

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:24.740 
it's especially internationally so
that's<00:04:23.850> probably<00:04:24.000> the<00:04:24.120> biggest<00:04:24.270> thing<00:04:24.510> and

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
that's probably the biggest thing and

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.860 
that's probably the biggest thing and
then<00:04:25.370> from<00:04:26.370> then<00:04:26.490> on<00:04:26.520> it's<00:04:26.669> like<00:04:26.940> you<00:04:27.480> really

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
then from then on it's like you really

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.240 
then from then on it's like you really
want<00:04:28.110> to<00:04:28.169> prove<00:04:28.320> yourself<00:04:28.410> and<00:04:28.830> so<00:04:29.040> that's

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
want to prove yourself and so that's

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.800 
want to prove yourself and so that's
it's<00:04:29.669> also<00:04:29.820> it's<00:04:30.060> maybe<00:04:30.300> my<00:04:30.419> biggest<00:04:30.600> hurdle

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
it's also it's maybe my biggest hurdle

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.750 
it's also it's maybe my biggest hurdle
overcome<00:04:31.410> but<00:04:31.950> it's<00:04:32.070> probably<00:04:32.310> been<00:04:32.430> the

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
overcome but it's probably been the

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.520 
overcome but it's probably been the
biggest<00:04:33.680> inspiration<00:04:35.180> to<00:04:36.180> my<00:04:36.870> single<00:04:37.169> my

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
biggest inspiration to my single my

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.170 
biggest inspiration to my single my
limited<00:04:38.160> success<00:04:38.340> today
