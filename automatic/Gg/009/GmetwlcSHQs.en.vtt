00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.180
 every year that choose tests several 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.700
 food robots among the best- selling 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.560
 or the most innovative these devices are 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.420
 today very versatile and their price 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.640
 varies from 100 to over 1000 euros for 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.740
 the high-end robots each of 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.660
 selected models is bought in the 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.160
 commerce is tested in laboratories 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.730
 independent in real conditions 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.810
 of use to determine the 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.969
 product performance 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.829
 a panel of experts assessed the suitability 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.690
 robots to realize different 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.960
 preparations they are simple and 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.490
 without cooking or more complex 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.860
 each machine must thus mount 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.630
 blanks in snow for the notation the 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.489
 experts take into account the duration the 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.489
 quality and the increase in the volume of 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.649
 blanks of notable differences are 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.290
 noted in particular as regards 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.300
 the consistency of the whites according to the 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.390
 instructions from the manufacturers of pasta to 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.579
 bread are also made so many 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.469
 kneading swelling of the dough and 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.979
 quality before and after cooking make 

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:09.570
 part of the evaluation criteria 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.790
 tests are done both for 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.909
 500 g pasta and at maximum capacity 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.680
 of the machine we also evaluate 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.510
 grinding performance using 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.940
 different ingredients such as 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.470
 parsley the experts note the time 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.560
 necessary for grinding and note the 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.119
 youth and the uniformity of the result of 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.479
 the same way carrots are 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.479
 hit 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.040
 and ice and that he experts 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.350
 then prepare fruit juices 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.250
 according to the appropriate settings before 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:45.280
 evaluate the vegetable texture the residues 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.290
 or even the taste of the cooking robot 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.330
 several additional recipes are 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.530
 made like islands for example 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.000
 floating 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.740
 these tests allow us to validate 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.290
 specific cooking performance 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.880
 to this type of robot the ease 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.350
 use of the devices is also 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.570
 taken into account in the evaluation of our 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.950
 experts a dozen criteria are 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.450
 studied as the clarity of the mode 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.860
 job 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.780
 preparing the robot getting started 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:15.520
 its filling and emptying the 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.660
 length of the cord sound level or 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.880
 still cleaning 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.290
 experts are also evaluating the 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.700
 aging of each face element 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.120
 to aggressions related to washing in 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.030
 machine 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.310
 the bowl the lid as well as each 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.130
 accessory suffered 59 agents dishwashing 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.920
 set on a 50 degree eco program 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.840
 for cooking robot aging 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.310
 of the heating element motor and 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.800
 seals are also 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.080
 evaluated to test the endurance of the 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.670
 engine the unit undergoes a series of 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.250
 phases of operation and phases of 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.320
 rest the goal is to simulate the 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.760
 Aging robot to detect 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.340
 potential failures 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.110
 following the same principle the element 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.330
 heating is then tested using 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.650
 heating and cooking programs 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.390
 find all the results of our 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.410
 cooking robot tests on our
