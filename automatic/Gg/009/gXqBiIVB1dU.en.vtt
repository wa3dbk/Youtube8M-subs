what<00:01:47.549> I've<00:01:47.670> been<00:01:47.820> into<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.119> protein<00:01:48.479> shakes

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
what I've been into the protein shakes

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.450 
what I've been into the protein shakes
but<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.290> kind<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:49.710> feel<00:01:49.890> like<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.159> protein

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
but I kind of feel like the protein

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.930 
but I kind of feel like the protein

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
shakes

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.930 
shakes
they<00:01:51.540> saw<00:01:51.840> every<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.740> we<00:01:52.860> need<00:01:53.520> together<00:01:53.760> in

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940

they saw every that we need together in
those<00:01:54.270> times<00:01:54.980> definitely<00:01:55.980> I<00:01:56.040> take<00:01:56.310> more<00:01:56.640> of

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
those times definitely I take more of

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.020 
those times definitely I take more of
that<00:01:57.030> if<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.630> was<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:57.930> same<00:01:58.140> feeling<00:01:59.100> down<00:01:59.670> or

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
that if I was that same feeling down or

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
that if I was that same feeling down or
just<00:02:00.800> give<00:02:01.800> my<00:02:01.890> system<00:02:02.220> a<00:02:02.280> bit<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.610> topic<00:02:03.050> it

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
just give my system a bit of a topic it

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.530 
just give my system a bit of a topic it
then<00:02:04.320> also<00:02:04.650> have<00:02:05.100> my<00:02:05.340> organic<00:02:06.060> wheat<00:02:06.360> grass

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
then also have my organic wheat grass

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.260 
then also have my organic wheat grass
powder<00:02:06.600> so<00:02:07.320> I<00:02:07.530> take<00:02:08.250> about<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.490> teaspoon<00:02:09.000> or<00:02:09.180> a

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
powder so I take about a teaspoon or a

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.780

half<00:02:09.450> teaspoon<00:02:09.960> of<00:02:10.140> those<00:02:10.260> and<00:02:11.160> put<00:02:11.490> it<00:02:11.610> into

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
half teaspoon of those and put it into

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.090 
half teaspoon of those and put it into
my<00:02:11.880> shakes<00:02:12.210> whenever<00:02:12.570> I<00:02:12.690> do<00:02:13.560> my<00:02:13.680> shapes<00:02:13.920> just

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
you know plenty of proteins then those

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.930 
you know plenty of proteins then those

I just think them into shaker with this
just<00:02:41.100> a<00:02:41.190> protein<00:02:41.520> shake

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
maybe some wheatgrass and shake it up

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.500 
maybe some wheatgrass and shake it up
maybe<00:02:44.370> take<00:02:44.610> some<00:02:44.790> wheat<00:02:44.910> grass<00:02:45.120> it's<00:02:45.360> not

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
maybe take some wheat grass it's not

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.630 
maybe take some wheat grass it's not
gonna<00:02:45.690> have<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.870> big<00:02:46.080> big<00:02:46.770> taste<00:02:47.070> off<00:02:47.310> unless

you're using a kind of a natural flavour
protein<00:02:52.320> powder<00:02:52.950> which<00:02:53.310> is<00:02:53.520> that<00:02:53.820> not<00:02:54.360> great

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709

taste<00:02:55.709> wise<00:02:55.950> I<00:02:55.980> find<00:02:56.370> a<00:02:56.430> little<00:02:56.670> bit<00:02:56.760> hard<00:02:57.030> hard

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
taste wise I find a little bit hard hard

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.360 
taste wise I find a little bit hard hard
to<00:02:57.690> take<00:02:57.870> those<00:02:58.470> options<00:02:58.980> there

validator myself but I could go with

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:06.920 
validator myself but I could go with
like<00:04:05.580> lots<00:04:05.760> of<00:04:05.849> chicken<00:04:06.239> and<00:04:06.330> beef<00:04:06.540> and<00:04:06.750> and

and<00:04:10.290> I<00:04:10.380> and<00:04:10.890> their<00:04:11.160> protein<00:04:11.760> shakes<00:04:11.970> obviously

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
and I and their protein shakes obviously

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.140 
and I and their protein shakes obviously
as<00:04:12.420> well<00:04:12.830> and<00:04:13.830> again<00:04:14.069> there's<00:04:14.250> no<00:04:14.400> more<00:04:14.760> you

from<00:04:17.010> taking<00:04:17.400> in<00:04:17.579> the<00:04:17.910> protein<00:04:18.269> actually

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
from taking in the protein actually

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.930 
from taking in the protein actually
can't<00:04:18.870> get<00:04:19.079> it<00:04:19.169> from<00:04:19.230> real<00:04:19.410> food<00:04:19.680> but<00:04:19.980> you<00:04:20.790> know

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
can't get it from real food but you know

can't get it from real food but you know
I'm<00:04:21.750> gonna<00:04:21.930> take<00:04:22.139> the<00:04:22.290> protein<00:04:22.620> shake<00:04:22.889> when

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
I'm gonna take the protein shake when

straight away so I'm gonna plug for my
protein<00:04:33.750> shake<00:04:33.930> every<00:04:34.229> time<00:04:34.500> and<00:04:34.740> to<00:04:34.800> be

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
protein shake every time and to be

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.040 
protein shake every time and to be
honest<00:04:35.160> I<00:04:35.220> we<00:04:35.400> couldn't<00:04:35.729> you<00:04:36.510> know<00:04:36.600> do<00:04:36.810> what<00:04:36.960> I
