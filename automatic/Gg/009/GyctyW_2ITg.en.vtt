I'll actually show you what I'll got in

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.439 
I'll actually show you what I'll got in
the<00:00:27.840> deck<00:00:28.019> each<00:00:28.619> pack<00:00:28.949> has<00:00:29.189> one<00:00:29.429> trigger<00:00:29.760> you

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
the deck each pack has one trigger you

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.209 
the deck each pack has one trigger you
have<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.779> take<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:30.929> trigger<00:00:31.199> +1<00:00:31.769> on<00:00:31.800> our<00:00:31.980> card

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
have to take the trigger +1 on our card

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.729 
have to take the trigger +1 on our card
so<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.210> trigger<00:00:33.450> you'll<00:00:33.989> always<00:00:34.290> see<00:00:34.440> me<00:00:34.469> take

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
so the trigger you'll always see me take

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.950 
so the trigger you'll always see me take
here<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.160> I'm<00:00:35.969> deciding<00:00:36.210> what<00:00:36.600> else<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.840> take

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
here and I'm deciding what else to take

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.380 
here and I'm deciding what else to take
in<00:00:37.200> this<00:00:37.380> pack<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.579> believe<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:38.940> also<00:00:39.149> goes

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
in this pack and I believe it also goes

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.660 
in this pack and I believe it also goes
the<00:00:39.510> single<00:00:40.170> rare<00:00:40.320> there<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.890> grade<00:00:41.190> one<00:00:41.430> with

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
the single rare there the grade one with

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.240 
the single rare there the grade one with
7,000<00:00:42.540> I<00:00:42.719> didn't<00:00:43.649> really<00:00:43.739> show<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:43.980> there

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
7,000 I didn't really show it there

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.520 
7,000 I didn't really show it there
because<00:00:44.690> they<00:00:45.690> were<00:00:45.750> explaining<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.410> rules

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
because they were explaining the rules

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.619 
because they were explaining the rules
and<00:00:46.739> stuff<00:00:46.860> more<00:00:47.160> so<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:47.670> let's<00:00:48.329> play<00:00:48.450> those

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.530 
Vanguard or do want to get a 7k grade
one<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:57.780> think<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:58.140> what<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.409> narrow<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.130> down<00:01:59.159> to

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
one I think is what I narrow it down to

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.050 
one I think is what I narrow it down to
so<00:02:00.540> right<00:02:00.990> here<00:02:01.369> kind<00:02:02.369> of<00:02:02.460> drawn<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.790> little<00:02:02.880> bit

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
so right here kind of drawn a little bit

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.969 
so right here kind of drawn a little bit
because<00:02:03.119> i'm<00:02:03.299> reading<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.630> card<00:02:03.979> evaluating

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
because i'm reading the card evaluating

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:05.930 
because i'm reading the card evaluating
things<00:02:05.189> than<00:02:05.460> that

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
things than that

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.240 
things than that
or<00:02:06.720> I<00:02:06.750> could<00:02:06.870> take<00:02:07.050> that<00:02:07.080> grade<00:02:07.440> 3<00:02:07.740> which<00:02:07.920> if<00:02:08.160> it

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
or I could take that grade 3 which if it

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.430 
or I could take that grade 3 which if it
hits<00:02:08.430> you<00:02:08.940> can<00:02:09.180> discard<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.810> card<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:10.200> draw<00:02:10.410> a

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
hits you can discard a card to draw a

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.670 
hits you can discard a card to draw a
card<00:02:11.090> which<00:02:12.090> is<00:02:12.360> good<00:02:12.660> but<00:02:13.230> at<00:02:13.350> the<00:02:13.410> same<00:02:13.530> time

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
card which is good but at the same time

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.980 
card which is good but at the same time
it's<00:02:13.890> not<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.220> greatest<00:02:14.520> just<00:02:15.000> because<00:02:15.300> you

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
it's not the greatest just because you

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.330 
it's not the greatest just because you
don't<00:02:16.050> have<00:02:16.140> a<00:02:16.230> 30<00:02:16.410> card<00:02:16.650> deck<00:02:16.800> in<00:02:16.920> this<00:02:17.040> format

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
don't have a 30 card deck in this format

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.850 
don't have a 30 card deck in this format
so<00:02:17.580> it's<00:02:17.760> not<00:02:17.940> too<00:02:18.300> hard<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.570> deck<00:02:18.780> out<00:02:18.960> but<00:02:19.740> I

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
so it's not too hard to deck out but I

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.430 
so it's not too hard to deck out but I
still<00:02:20.070> took<00:02:20.250> it<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:21.480> set<00:02:21.870> 5<00:02:22.080> early<00:02:22.260> treatment

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
still took it the set 5 early treatment

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.350 
still took it the set 5 early treatment
and<00:02:22.680> we<00:02:22.710> had<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:23.040> grade<00:02:23.190> threes<00:02:23.550> so<00:02:23.880> I<00:02:24.090> was
