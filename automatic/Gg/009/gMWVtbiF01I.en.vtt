idea using nearly nothing what Chanel is
known<00:01:19.820> for<00:01:20.119> and<00:01:20.570> still<00:01:20.840> make<00:01:21.020> it<00:01:21.170> look<00:01:21.200> Chanel

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
it's all about volume but Airy volume

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.880 
it's all about volume but Airy volume
because<00:01:30.340> materials<00:01:31.230> nearly<00:01:32.230> I<00:01:32.410> wouldn't<00:01:32.800> say

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
because materials nearly I wouldn't say

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.380 
because materials nearly I wouldn't say
see-through<00:01:33.370> because<00:01:33.610> we<00:01:33.730> really<00:01:34.030> don't<00:01:34.240> see

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
see-through because we really don't see

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.900 
see-through because we really don't see
but<00:01:34.930> it's<00:01:35.170> like<00:01:35.410> a<00:01:35.440> kind<00:01:35.740> of<00:01:35.860> mesh<00:01:36.160> but<00:01:36.730> it's

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
very modern technical material but the

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.570
