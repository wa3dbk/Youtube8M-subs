the<00:02:47.440> next<00:02:47.680> hacker<00:02:47.830> already<00:02:48.310> we're<00:02:49.030> going<00:02:49.300> to

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
the next hacker already we're going to

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.980 
the next hacker already we're going to
recommend<00:02:49.720> that<00:02:50.440> you<00:02:50.620> wait<00:02:50.830> until<00:02:51.220> later<00:02:51.670> in

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
recommend that you wait until later in

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.360 
recommend that you wait until later in
2014<00:02:52.990> to<00:02:53.320> try<00:02:53.680> it<00:02:54.010> out<00:02:54.960> so<00:02:55.960> this<00:02:56.170> obviously

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
2014 to try it out so this obviously

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.270 
2014 to try it out so this obviously
means<00:02:57.370> that<00:02:57.810> right<00:02:58.810> now<00:02:58.840> operating<00:02:59.830> system<00:03:00.160> is

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
means that right now operating system is

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.250 
means that right now operating system is
fairly<00:03:00.520> raw<00:03:00.910> a<00:03:01.180> lot<00:03:01.360> of<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:01.570> features<00:03:01.750> haven't

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
fairly raw a lot of the features haven't

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.960 
fairly raw a lot of the features haven't
been<00:03:02.440> implemented<00:03:03.310> therefore<00:03:03.790> you're

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
been implemented therefore you're

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.280 
been implemented therefore you're
probably<00:03:04.180> going<00:03:04.480> to<00:03:04.570> have<00:03:04.690> to<00:03:04.750> use<00:03:04.990> quite<00:03:05.230> a

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
probably going to have to use quite a

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.840 
probably going to have to use quite a
lot<00:03:05.470> of<00:03:05.560> you<00:03:05.710> command<00:03:06.040> lines<00:03:06.280> and<00:03:06.520> therefore

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
lot of you command lines and therefore

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.750 
lot of you command lines and therefore
it's<00:03:07.030> not<00:03:07.440> going<00:03:08.440> to<00:03:08.590> be<00:03:08.680> good<00:03:08.800> for<00:03:09.100> a<00:03:09.280> lot<00:03:09.520> of

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
it's not going to be good for a lot of

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.520 
it's not going to be good for a lot of
users<00:03:10.510> who<00:03:10.690> aren't<00:03:11.260> that<00:03:11.380> familiar<00:03:11.620> with<00:03:12.100> the

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
users who aren't that familiar with the

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.610 
users who aren't that familiar with the
the<00:03:14.530> next<00:03:14.800> workflow<00:03:15.670> let's<00:03:16.060> use<00:03:16.330> that<00:03:16.560> now<00:03:17.560> I

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
the next workflow let's use that now I

they haven't given an exact pricing
right<00:04:18.760> now<00:04:19.049> obviously<00:04:20.049> it<00:04:20.200> will<00:04:20.320> depend<00:04:20.500> on

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
right now obviously it will depend on

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.250 
right now obviously it will depend on
exactly<00:04:21.430> how<00:04:21.880> you<00:04:22.060> decide<00:04:22.450> to<00:04:22.600> customize<00:04:23.080> your

rig but it's going to cost about fifteen
hundred<00:04:25.750> dollars<00:04:26.380> so

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
hundred dollars so

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.570 
hundred dollars so
that's<00:04:27.130> about<00:04:27.490> 9<00:04:28.260> 930<00:04:29.260> chance<00:04:29.920> obviously

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
that's about 9 930 chance obviously

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.000 
that's about 9 930 chance obviously
excluding<00:04:31.240> taxes<00:04:31.750> once<00:04:32.230> again<00:04:32.350> I<00:04:32.500> just<00:04:32.620> like

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
excluding taxes once again I just like

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.380 
excluding taxes once again I just like
to<00:04:33.130> reiterate<00:04:33.220> that<00:04:33.580> that<00:04:33.910> is<00:04:34.060> one<00:04:34.240> of<00:04:34.360> the

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
to reiterate that that is one of the

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:35.700 
to reiterate that that is one of the
highest<00:04:34.660> end<00:04:35.020> machines<00:04:35.410> and<00:04:35.590> that's

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
highest end machines and that's

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.460 
highest end machines and that's
obviously<00:04:35.890> targeted<00:04:36.670> of<00:04:37.180> people<00:04:37.600> who<00:04:37.750> want<00:04:38.320> to

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
ludacris frame rates so where does this

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.110 
ludacris frame rates so where does this
actually<00:04:46.780> leave<00:04:47.230> us<00:04:47.470> in<00:04:47.770> terms<00:04:48.190> of<00:04:48.430> PC<00:04:48.880> gaming

actually leave us in terms of PC gaming
well<00:04:49.990> not<00:04:50.500> that<00:04:50.740> much<00:04:50.920> is<00:04:51.070> going<00:04:51.280> to<00:04:51.310> be

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
well not that much is going to be

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.120 
well not that much is going to be
changing<00:04:51.880> for<00:04:52.150> a<00:04:52.180> while<00:04:52.690> games<00:04:53.620> developers

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.590 
changing for a while games developers
are<00:04:54.250> definitely<00:04:54.610> becoming<00:04:54.910> more<00:04:55.180> intimate

now for gamers is and games developers

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.490 
now for gamers is and games developers
that<00:05:14.920> Linux<00:05:15.640> is<00:05:15.850> in<00:05:16.780> this<00:05:16.960> chicken<00:05:17.260> and<00:05:17.380> egg

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
that Linux is in this chicken and egg

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.010 
that Linux is in this chicken and egg
situation<00:05:17.610> there's<00:05:18.610> not<00:05:18.820> enough<00:05:19.120> games

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
situation there's not enough games

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.410 
situation there's not enough games
developers<00:05:20.890> who<00:05:21.340> are<00:05:21.370> really<00:05:21.790> promoting

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:22.420 
developers who are really promoting

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.690 
developers who are really promoting
Linux<00:05:22.810> for<00:05:23.230> most<00:05:23.500> gamers<00:05:23.740> to<00:05:23.980> jump<00:05:24.250> on<00:05:24.430> it<00:05:24.550> in

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:24.700 
Linux for most gamers to jump on it in

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.690 
Linux for most gamers to jump on it in
contrary<00:05:25.540> you've<00:05:26.350> got<00:05:26.560> about<00:05:26.740> the<00:05:27.070> well

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700 
contrary you've got about the well

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:32.190 
contrary you've got about the well
opposite<00:05:28.180> problem<00:05:28.570> so<00:05:29.370> this<00:05:30.370> is<00:05:30.900> very<00:05:31.900> similar

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.200 
opposite problem so this is very similar

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.170 
opposite problem so this is very similar
of<00:05:32.410> course<00:05:32.650> to<00:05:32.800> what<00:05:32.890> nintendo<00:05:33.400> experiencing

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:26.830 
slowly starting to get a foothold so i

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.290

guess<00:06:27.280> we're<00:06:27.460> just<00:06:27.490> going<00:06:27.700> to<00:06:27.760> have<00:06:27.910> to<00:06:27.940> see

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.300 
guess we're just going to have to see

steam OS is i have a feeling that for

steam OS is i have a feeling that for
many<00:06:34.060> people<00:06:34.330> it's<00:06:35.020> not<00:06:35.320> going<00:06:35.530> to<00:06:35.650> be<00:06:35.770> the

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:35.890 
many people it's not going to be the

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:37.170 
many people it's not going to be the
operating<00:06:36.280> systems<00:06:36.640> that<00:06:36.790> you're<00:06:36.910> going<00:06:37.090> to

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:37.180 
operating systems that you're going to

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.120 
operating systems that you're going to
want<00:06:37.300> to<00:06:37.390> use<00:06:37.450> as<00:06:37.870> your<00:06:37.990> main<00:06:38.290> i<00:06:38.560> would<00:06:39.040> imagine

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.130 
want to use as your main i would imagine

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:40.239 
want to use as your main i would imagine
for<00:06:39.880> many

00:06:40.239 --> 00:06:40.249 
for many

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:42.999 
for many
it<00:06:40.309> would<00:06:40.429> be<00:06:40.639> like<00:06:40.669> a<00:06:41.179> virtual<00:06:42.109> box<00:06:42.529> type<00:06:42.859> of

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:43.009 
it would be like a virtual box type of

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:46.239 
it would be like a virtual box type of
affair<00:06:43.399> or<00:06:43.669> maybe<00:06:44.409> install<00:06:45.409> it<00:06:45.589> on<00:06:45.709> a<00:06:45.739> second

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:46.249 
affair or maybe install it on a second

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:48.699 
affair or maybe install it on a second
partition<00:06:46.759> which<00:06:47.689> could<00:06:48.019> also<00:06:48.139> be<00:06:48.499> a<00:06:48.529> good

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:48.709 
partition which could also be a good

00:06:48.709 --> 00:06:50.409 
partition which could also be a good
option<00:06:48.889> obviously<00:06:49.489> not<00:06:49.639> all<00:06:49.819> games<00:06:50.119> are<00:06:50.269> going

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:50.419 
option obviously not all games are going

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:52.629 
option obviously not all games are going
to<00:06:50.539> support<00:06:50.869> it<00:06:50.989> yet<00:06:51.019> but<00:06:51.589> their<00:06:51.859> ass<00:06:52.099> going<00:06:52.519> to

00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:52.639 
to support it yet but their ass going to

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:55.359 
to support it yet but their ass going to
increase<00:06:53.089> the<00:06:53.689> amount<00:06:53.959> is<00:06:54.169> better<00:06:54.619> compilers

00:06:55.359 --> 00:06:55.369 
increase the amount is better compilers

00:06:55.369 --> 00:06:57.069 
increase the amount is better compilers
and<00:06:55.399> debuggers<00:06:56.059> and<00:06:56.209> so<00:06:56.359> on<00:06:56.509> are<00:06:56.689> being

00:06:57.069 --> 00:06:57.079 
and debuggers and so on are being
