this<00:00:05.310> summer<00:00:05.549> were<00:00:05.730> focused<00:00:06.150> on<00:00:06.240> creating<00:00:06.990> a

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
this summer were focused on creating a

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.799 
this summer were focused on creating a
new<00:00:07.350> class<00:00:07.589> of<00:00:07.620> surfactants<00:00:08.519> new<00:00:09.120> materials

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
new class of surfactants new materials

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.690 
new class of surfactants new materials
that<00:00:10.019> we<00:00:10.110> can<00:00:10.290> use<00:00:10.500> in<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:10.740> polyurethane<00:00:11.460> foam

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
that we can use in the polyurethane foam

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.470 
that we can use in the polyurethane foam
industry

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:13.480 
industry

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.299 
industry
producers<00:00:14.379> are<00:00:14.500> trying<00:00:14.740> to<00:00:14.830> become<00:00:14.980> more

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:15.309 
producers are trying to become more

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.540 
producers are trying to become more
green<00:00:15.610> more<00:00:16.029> ecologically<00:00:16.689> conscious<00:00:17.550> so

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:18.550 
green more ecologically conscious so

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.790 
green more ecologically conscious so
they're<00:00:18.759> using<00:00:19.330> different<00:00:20.080> oils<00:00:20.410> we're

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:20.800 
they're using different oils we're

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.569 
they're using different oils we're
working<00:00:21.009> with<00:00:21.279> soybean<00:00:21.640> oil<00:00:23.220> being<00:00:24.220> able<00:00:24.490> to

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:24.579 
working with soybean oil being able to

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:25.650 
working with soybean oil being able to
implement<00:00:24.789> these<00:00:25.090> green<00:00:25.419> chemistry

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.660 
implement these green chemistry

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.060 
implement these green chemistry
techniques<00:00:26.259> I<00:00:26.439> think<00:00:26.680> it's<00:00:26.800> going<00:00:26.890> to<00:00:26.949> be

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070 
techniques I think it's going to be

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.560 
techniques I think it's going to be
really<00:00:27.279> great<00:00:27.640> for<00:00:27.669> the<00:00:27.880> environment<00:00:27.970> because

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
really great for the environment because

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.269 
really great for the environment because
you're<00:00:29.050> learning<00:00:29.650> these<00:00:29.740> new<00:00:29.920> techniques

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:30.279 
you're learning these new techniques

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:32.759 
you're learning these new techniques
which<00:00:30.609> might<00:00:30.939> be<00:00:30.970> more<00:00:31.839> efficient<00:00:32.379> at<00:00:32.529> what

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:32.769 
which might be more efficient at what

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:34.170 
which might be more efficient at what
they're<00:00:32.890> trying<00:00:33.070> to<00:00:33.190> do<00:00:33.370> and<00:00:33.640> that's<00:00:33.879> what<00:00:34.089> we

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
they're trying to do and that's what we

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.680 
they're trying to do and that's what we
hope<00:00:34.330> to<00:00:34.360> do<00:00:34.629> with<00:00:34.870> our<00:00:35.050> process<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:37.300> end<00:00:37.480> goal

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
hope to do with our process the end goal

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.140 
hope to do with our process the end goal
was<00:00:37.960> that<00:00:38.199> we<00:00:38.530> make<00:00:38.739> foams<00:00:39.100> that<00:00:39.489> are<00:00:39.820> more

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.150 
was that we make foams that are more

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.310 
was that we make foams that are more
efficient<00:00:40.570> than<00:00:40.629> what's<00:00:40.870> out<00:00:40.989> there<00:00:41.170> right

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
efficient than what's out there right

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.530 
efficient than what's out there right
now<00:00:41.350> if<00:00:42.040> we<00:00:42.280> can<00:00:42.430> do<00:00:42.519> that<00:00:42.550> just<00:00:43.120> opening<00:00:43.480> the

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:43.540 
now if we can do that just opening the

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.660 
now if we can do that just opening the
doors<00:00:43.870> for<00:00:44.250> developing<00:00:45.250> even<00:00:45.489> better

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
doors for developing even better

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.209 
doors for developing even better
techniques<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:50.079> exciting<00:00:50.440> part<00:00:50.739> of<00:00:50.860> science

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:51.219 
techniques the exciting part of science

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:52.650 
techniques the exciting part of science
is<00:00:51.340> getting<00:00:51.579> into<00:00:51.730> the<00:00:51.820> lab<00:00:52.000> and<00:00:52.270> finding

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
is getting into the lab and finding

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.630 
is getting into the lab and finding
something<00:00:52.840> new<00:00:53.050> I<00:00:53.440> like<00:00:53.800> to<00:00:53.890> be<00:00:54.010> challenged<00:00:54.520> in

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
something new I like to be challenged in

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.430 
something new I like to be challenged in
the<00:00:54.730> lab<00:00:54.910> and<00:00:55.180> I<00:00:55.629> think<00:00:55.870> that's<00:00:56.020> kind<00:00:56.260> of<00:00:56.320> the

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
the lab and I think that's kind of the

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.259 
the lab and I think that's kind of the
best<00:00:56.590> way<00:00:56.800> to<00:00:56.859> learn<00:00:57.100> until<00:00:57.760> you're<00:00:58.059> doing

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269 
best way to learn until you're doing

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:00.060 
best way to learn until you're doing
something<00:00:58.480> 40<00:00:58.870> hours<00:00:59.140> a<00:00:59.170> week<00:00:59.260> in<00:00:59.649> the<00:00:59.890> lab

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
something 40 hours a week in the lab

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.279 
something 40 hours a week in the lab
that's<00:01:00.730> when<00:01:00.969> you're<00:01:01.090> really<00:01:01.120> getting<00:01:01.840> a<00:01:02.019> good

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289 
that's when you're really getting a good

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:05.310 
that's when you're really getting a good
idea<00:01:02.590> if<00:01:02.829> it's<00:01:03.010> something<00:01:03.190> you<00:01:03.370> want<00:01:03.550> to<00:01:03.609> do<00:01:04.320> we

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
idea if it's something you want to do we

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.200 
idea if it's something you want to do we
believe<00:01:05.679> that<00:01:05.710> our<00:01:06.160> undergraduates<00:01:06.850> are

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
believe that our undergraduates are

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.690 
believe that our undergraduates are
better<00:01:07.420> prepared<00:01:07.690> for<00:01:08.020> graduate<00:01:08.770> school<00:01:08.890> for

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
better prepared for graduate school for

better prepared for graduate school for

junior year summer it's awesome and I'm
gonna<00:01:39.450> hopefully<00:01:40.050> continue<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.740> do<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:41.010> until

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
gonna hopefully continue to do it until

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.760 
gonna hopefully continue to do it until
I<00:01:41.370> graduate<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.150> if<00:01:42.870> we<00:01:43.050> do<00:01:43.200> get<00:01:43.320> published

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
I graduate and if we do get published

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.680 
I graduate and if we do get published
that's<00:01:43.980> going<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.160> be<00:01:44.220> huge<00:01:44.490> for<00:01:44.690> graduate

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
that's going to be huge for graduate

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.300 
that's going to be huge for graduate
school<00:01:45.810> now<00:01:46.530> hopefully<00:01:46.800> I'll<00:01:47.040> just<00:01:47.160> be<00:01:47.250> able

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
school now hopefully I'll just be able

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.180 
school now hopefully I'll just be able
to<00:01:47.430> continue<00:01:47.880> my<00:01:48.060> education
