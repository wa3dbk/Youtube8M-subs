00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.849 

there's<00:00:18.210> nobody<00:00:18.330> fine<00:00:18.630> I'll<00:00:18.990> say<00:00:19.350> I<00:00:19.380> had<00:00:19.650> that

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
there's nobody fine I'll say I had that

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.310 
there's nobody fine I'll say I had that
sort<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:20.070> I<00:00:20.369> was<00:00:20.460> like<00:00:20.640> you<00:00:21.060> know<00:00:21.199> what<00:00:22.199> are<00:00:22.260> you

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
sort of I was like you know what are you

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.990 
sort of I was like you know what are you
doing<00:00:22.529> out<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:24.619> get<00:00:25.619> this<00:00:25.650> dealing<00:00:26.039> in<00:00:26.699> big

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
doing out I get this dealing in big

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.609 
doing out I get this dealing in big
sheets<00:00:27.269> this<00:00:27.510> is<00:00:27.689> what's<00:00:27.869> left<00:00:28.080> over<00:00:28.260> from<00:00:28.500> the

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
sheets this is what's left over from the

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.950 
sheets this is what's left over from the
last<00:00:28.800> sheet<00:00:29.039> that<00:00:29.160> I<00:00:29.220> used<00:00:29.539> the<00:00:30.539> whole<00:00:30.689> idea

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
last sheet that I used the whole idea

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.749 
last sheet that I used the whole idea
behind<00:00:31.019> steel<00:00:31.529> at<00:00:31.679> least<00:00:31.800> for<00:00:31.980> knives<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.520> that

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
behind steel at least for knives is that

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.580 
behind steel at least for knives is that
you<00:00:33.059> want<00:00:33.239> your<00:00:33.329> still<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.570> be<00:00:33.660> nice<00:00:33.780> hard<00:00:34.200> so

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
you want your still to be nice hard so

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.889 
you want your still to be nice hard so
that'll<00:00:34.800> hold<00:00:35.010> an<00:00:35.219> edge<00:00:35.370> once<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.270> pass<00:00:36.870> a

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
that'll hold an edge once you pass a

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.630 
that'll hold an edge once you pass a
certain<00:00:37.290> point<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.920> gets<00:00:37.980> brittle<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.489> or

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
certain point it gets brittle and or

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.549 
certain point it gets brittle and or
chip<00:00:38.940> so<00:00:39.420> it's<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:39.719> balance<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:40.170> got<00:00:40.290> if<00:00:40.469> you

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
chip so it's that balance you got if you

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.430 
chip so it's that balance you got if you
want<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:40.890> hard<00:00:41.219> but<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.610> also<00:00:41.730> want<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.030> tough

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
want it hard but you also want it tough

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.540 
want it hard but you also want it tough
and<00:00:43.440> take<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.739> over<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.629> chop<00:00:45.870> saw<00:00:46.140> and

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
and take it over to the chop saw and

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.900 
and take it over to the chop saw and
hack<00:00:47.550> out<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:48.000> rough<00:00:48.210> shape

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910

then<00:00:54.860> I<00:00:54.920> bring<00:00:55.070> it<00:00:55.160> over<00:00:55.190> here<00:00:55.340> and<00:00:55.550> I<00:00:55.580> use<00:00:55.730> a

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
then I bring it over here and I use a

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.170 
then I bring it over here and I use a
were<00:00:56.180> crest<00:00:56.510> on<00:00:56.960> this<00:00:57.260> and<00:00:57.820> rough<00:00:58.820> out<00:00:59.000> the

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
were crest on this and rough out the

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:09.310 
were crest on this and rough out the
shape<00:00:59.390> on<00:00:59.600> that<00:01:07.330> and<00:01:08.330> then<00:01:08.600> I<00:01:08.690> finish<00:01:08.990> up<00:01:09.140> over

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
shape on that and then I finish up over

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.990 
shape on that and then I finish up over
here<00:01:09.530> on<00:01:09.620> my<00:01:09.650> horizontal<00:01:10.160> right<00:01:10.310> here<00:01:10.520> where<00:01:10.970> I

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
here on my horizontal right here where I

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.850 
here on my horizontal right here where I
can<00:01:11.090> get<00:01:11.360> you<00:01:11.630> know<00:01:11.660> the<00:01:11.870> exact<00:01:12.229> it's

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
can get you know the exact it's

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:23.680 
can get you know the exact it's
perfectly<00:01:13.490> ninety<00:01:13.790> degrees<00:01:14.000> so<00:01:22.240> after<00:01:23.240> that's

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
perfectly ninety degrees so after that's

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.810 
perfectly ninety degrees so after that's
done<00:01:24.020> I'll<00:01:24.410> take<00:01:24.770> it<00:01:25.040> over<00:01:25.100> here<00:01:25.220> and<00:01:25.460> drill<00:01:25.670> it

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
done I'll take it over here and drill it

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.890 
done I'll take it over here and drill it
and<00:01:31.150> then<00:01:32.150> it's<00:01:32.270> ready<00:01:32.390> to<00:01:32.509> go<00:01:32.630> to<00:01:32.690> heat

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
and then it's ready to go to heat

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.660 
and then it's ready to go to heat
treatment<00:01:33.350> it's<00:01:33.800> a<00:01:33.860> lot<00:01:34.100> about<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:34.490> heat

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
treatment it's a lot about the heat

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.760 
treatment it's a lot about the heat
treatment<00:01:34.820> that's<00:01:35.150> not<00:01:35.360> right<00:01:35.600> it's<00:01:35.840> just<00:01:36.050> you

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
treatment that's not right it's just you

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.240 
treatment that's not right it's just you
know<00:01:36.890> junk<00:01:37.640> steel<00:01:38.710> about<00:01:39.710> two<00:01:39.920> weeks<00:01:40.100> later

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
know junk steel about two weeks later

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.800 
know junk steel about two weeks later
and<00:01:40.550> they<00:01:40.610> come<00:01:40.790> back<00:01:41.000> and<00:01:41.330> that's<00:01:41.540> when<00:01:41.780> I

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
and they come back and that's when I

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.410 
and they come back and that's when I
start<00:01:42.649> grinding<00:01:42.860> the<00:01:43.040> bevels<00:01:43.369> on<00:01:43.460> them<00:01:43.580> I<00:01:43.850> take

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
start grinding the bevels on them I take

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.870 
start grinding the bevels on them I take
this<00:01:44.540> off<00:01:44.720> so<00:01:44.960> this<00:01:45.050> is<00:01:45.110> slack<00:01:45.530> and<00:01:46.130> then<00:01:46.790> when

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
this off so this is slack and then when

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.100 
this off so this is slack and then when
I<00:01:46.910> push<00:01:47.149> it<00:01:47.180> into<00:01:47.420> it<00:01:47.570> it<00:01:47.630> sort<00:01:47.720> of<00:01:47.810> gives<00:01:47.930> a

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
I push it into it it sort of gives a

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.380 
I push it into it it sort of gives a
little<00:01:48.229> bit<00:01:48.410> you<00:01:48.560> know<00:01:48.680> so<00:01:49.090> that's<00:01:50.090> how<00:01:50.210> I<00:01:50.240> get

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
little bit you know so that's how I get

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.810 
little bit you know so that's how I get
that<00:01:50.540> and<00:01:51.320> then<00:01:51.410> I<00:01:51.530> go<00:01:51.649> to<00:01:51.680> handles<00:01:52.130> I'll

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
that and then I go to handles I'll

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.359 
that and then I go to handles I'll
scribe<00:01:53.210> out<00:01:53.360> the<00:01:53.570> basic<00:01:53.899> shape<00:01:54.170> go<00:01:55.069> I'll<00:01:55.220> go

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
scribe out the basic shape go I'll go

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:04.450 
scribe out the basic shape go I'll go
and<00:01:55.399> you<00:01:56.149> know<00:01:56.240> rough<00:01:56.569> do<00:01:57.020> them<00:01:57.170> roughly

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.370 

all<00:02:05.000> these<00:02:05.210> things<00:02:05.420> I<00:02:05.570> have<00:02:05.659> to<00:02:05.810> do<00:02:05.900> up<00:02:06.080> through

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
all these things I have to do up through

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.960 
all these things I have to do up through
different<00:02:06.710> grits<00:02:06.890> I<00:02:07.010> started<00:02:07.520> usually<00:02:07.820> like

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
different grits I started usually like

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.590 
different grits I started usually like
60<00:02:08.450> grit<00:02:08.920> 120<00:02:09.920> grit<00:02:10.130> grit<00:02:10.640> beam<00:02:10.850> how<00:02:11.209> rough

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
60 grit 120 grit grit beam how rough

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.170 
60 grit 120 grit grit beam how rough
they<00:02:11.780> pick<00:02:11.990> the<00:02:12.140> belts<00:02:12.590> are<00:02:12.709> that<00:02:12.860> I'm<00:02:12.950> using

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
they pick the belts are that I'm using

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.010 
they pick the belts are that I'm using
then<00:02:14.180> I'll<00:02:14.270> take<00:02:14.450> it<00:02:14.480> over<00:02:14.630> here<00:02:14.900> and<00:02:14.959> just

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
then I'll take it over here and just

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.740 
then I'll take it over here and just
drop<00:02:15.290> it<00:02:15.670> sort<00:02:16.670> of<00:02:16.700> like<00:02:16.819> you're<00:02:16.940> a<00:02:17.120> razor<00:02:17.330> you

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
drop it sort of like you're a razor you

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.890 
drop it sort of like you're a razor you
know<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:22.160> difference<00:02:22.459> between<00:02:22.520> like<00:02:22.940> $100

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
know the difference between like $100
