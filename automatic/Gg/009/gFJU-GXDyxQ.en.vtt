 transfer is a set of accessories

 all your activities that it is about 

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:58.489
 so-called extreme sports like for example 

00:00:56.569 --> 00:01:00.859
 from parachute jump to jump 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.389
 the elastic that kind of ski thing 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:04.610
 diving for example thanks to his 

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:06.170
 waterproof case and shockproof but 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.890
 also our activities more 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.860
 traditional 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.250
 walking cycling rollerblading skating 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.100
 board 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.750
 etc etc compared to the generations 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.789
 previous this new version 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.100
 silver the addition stands out for its 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:20.750
 compactness on a product that is 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.609
 much less wide much more 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.990
 compact and less bulky and 

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:25.969
 also by its lightness 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.759
 gopro has worked a lot of his product 

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:30.770
 which today weighs only 74 g 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.609
 order of his subwoofer is a little bit of 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.310
 130 grams 

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:36.020
 once inserted into its box by 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.719
 compared to previous versions this 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.369
 new gopro silver edition inaugurates 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:42.170
 a new sensor and a new 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.420
 optical is concretely it will allow 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.460
 to improve the picture quality is 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.780
 significantly increase the capacity to 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.219
 to shoot in low light 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.450
 when it's dark what can be 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:51.679
 still very practical in a lot of 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.430
 circumstances 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:55.620
 always in the radius of the novelties there 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.080
 a new gopro is able to film in 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.400
 1080p it did not change the same 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.590
 definition in a living room TV 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.180
 but in 60 frames per second 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.190
 concretely it will allow to have a 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.750
 very fluid image even when there is 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.300
 movement for example if we talk to each other 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.320
 of a motorcycle did not go karting downhill 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.170
 ski or that sort of thing 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.430
 other novelty and not least if 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.780
 we go down a little bit the definition 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.580
 surpasses in 720p 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.530
 so for an internet broadcast 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.750
 this new gopro is capable of 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.220
 to film in 120 image per second so 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.720
 there an interest is not fluidity and 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.670
 to fluidify the image it's going to be having 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.440
 super slow motion we will be able to have 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.920
 an action in slow motion without any 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.390
 jerky 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.220
 so that was for the novelties 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.660
 nevertheless we will keep some 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.880
 little things old versions 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.340
 especially at the level of the ports we are going 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.420
 find a microphone output hdmi so he 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.310
 will allow to connect the gopro 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.040
 directly on the TV for 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.140
 watch the videos a usb output at the 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.450
 times to charge the camera and to 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.130
 transfer videos safe to the computer 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.280
 and the microsd slot to insert the card 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.080
 memory the gopro hero iii plus silver 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.850
 edition offers different modes of 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.980
 all very simple operation 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.140
 of use since this button is enough 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.570
 at sailing also different menus and a 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.190
 second button would activate and with 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.739
 the parameters we will find 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.840
 different modes that are notably by 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:13.500
 default first two camera mode for 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.090
 film camera mode so at 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.640
 note that the sensor is a sensor of 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.980
 10 million pixels 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.750
 the burst mode so it is worth noting that 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.400
 the ago possible surrender is able to 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.540
 take bursts of photos at 10 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.850
 frames per second what is a 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.650
 really high cadence 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.760
 the time lapse mode concretely he 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.560
 is about taking pictures at 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.650
 regular intervals in the meantime 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.780
 adjustable from 0.5 to 60 seconds 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.400
 settings of course to go 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.260
 further in the settings a 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.860
 then returns to the camera mode he 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.360
 just throw with the button to our 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.579
 news from the gopro hero iii plus 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.170
 silver edition integrated wi fi mode 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:51.180
 so just press the button 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.100
 wifi to take control 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.260
 complete the camera directly via a 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.989
 smartphone be the dedicated app there 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.920
 for example I can directly had to 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.680
 but the camera 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.510
 and then be able to preview what 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.980
 the latter is filming at the 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.569
 passage will be quite possible too 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.760
 to change from the set of settings to 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.140
 need the definition the mode of making 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.050
 view etc etc 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:16.459
 like here for example and we see 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:19.079
 directly what the camera is going to film 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:23.210
 is quite possible therefore to launch 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:25.650
 recording as here to cut it 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:31.110
 and it is possible to access as well 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:32.610
 the set of camera settings this 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.160
 that I liked the least about the 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.889
 gopro euro3 plus silver edition concerns 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.540
 the basic endowment in effect basic 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:41.370
 in the packaging gopro do not live of 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.630
 memory card with the camera it's 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.970
 impose to go buy a share 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.700
 elsewhere second point with the camera 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:50.220
 gopro only delivers the fixing kit of 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.810
 base with the fixed arm will have to back up and 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.190
 the small discs one of 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.410
 fixing to move the camera 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.240
 on the other hand if we want fixations a 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.590
 little more specific for all that is 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.660
 auto ski etc 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.450
 you will have to buy them separately 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.370
 what I liked most about the 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.350
 gopro 3 plus silver concerns in a 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.340
 first time its compactness and 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.600
 lightness 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.130
 it's a model that's really everything 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.900
 little light you can really 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.300
 bring everywhere with you and that's 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.039
 really very appreciable in a second 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.320
 other time very positive point on this 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:20.880
 model image quality and quality 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.080
 sound recording and is substantially 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.620
 improved compared to the model 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.960
 previous 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.789
 it can be used in all circumstances 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.710
 whether day or night 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:30.180
 even on fast movements that make 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.380
 wind noises usually on 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.050
 will always have a very good quality of 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.930
 catching last point very positive 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:39.180
 also the wifi is now integrated 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.130
 on the silver model which allows to 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.350
 drive the camera directly from a 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.880
 smartphone and what does not require 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.190
 party bought on the remote in 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.990
 parallel I hope this video you 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.460
 liked it if you have questions or questions 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.390
 comments do not hesitate to leave them 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.390
