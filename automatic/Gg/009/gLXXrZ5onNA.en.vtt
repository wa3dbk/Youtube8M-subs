00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
what if I want to adjust a reverb go to

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.570 
what if I want to adjust a reverb go to
my<00:02:19.020> reverb<00:02:19.290> knob<00:02:19.500> this<00:02:19.950> one's<00:02:20.190> already<00:02:20.340> set

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
my reverb knob this one's already set

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:28.120 
my reverb knob this one's already set
for<00:02:20.610> stage

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.120 

very<00:02:28.790> nice<00:02:29.090> now<00:02:29.570> a<00:02:29.870> common<00:02:30.440> effect<00:02:30.680> that<00:02:31.010> you

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
very nice now a common effect that you

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.790 
very nice now a common effect that you
use<00:02:31.310> on<00:02:31.540> electric<00:02:32.540> pianos<00:02:32.900> is<00:02:33.080> tremolo

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
use on electric pianos is tremolo

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.890 
use on electric pianos is tremolo
tremolo<00:02:34.400> gives<00:02:34.610> that<00:02:34.760> balancing<00:02:35.540> back<00:02:35.690> and

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
tremolo gives that balancing back and

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.860 
tremolo gives that balancing back and
forth<00:02:36.140> kind<00:02:36.560> of<00:02:36.650> vibe<00:02:36.800> so<00:02:37.310> I'll<00:02:37.490> use<00:02:37.670> my<00:02:37.870> mfx

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
forth kind of vibe so I'll use my mfx

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.940 
forth kind of vibe so I'll use my mfx
here<00:02:40.540> you<00:02:41.540> hear<00:02:41.810> it<00:02:41.930> kind<00:02:42.290> of<00:02:42.410> moving<00:02:42.650> back<00:02:42.740> and

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
here you hear it kind of moving back and

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.420 
here you hear it kind of moving back and
forth<00:02:43.160> so<00:02:43.430> there's<00:02:44.120> my<00:02:44.330> mfx<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:45.200> tremolo<00:02:45.470> just

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
forth so there's my mfx the tremolo just

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.870 
forth so there's my mfx the tremolo just
that<00:02:46.640> quick<00:02:48.130> and<00:02:49.130> if<00:02:49.250> I<00:02:49.340> want<00:02:49.520> to<00:02:49.550> adjust<00:02:49.640> the

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
that quick and if I want to adjust the

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.270 
that quick and if I want to adjust the
speed<00:02:50.180> I<00:02:50.390> can<00:02:51.260> turn<00:02:51.560> it<00:02:51.650> more<00:02:51.770> to<00:02:51.890> the<00:02:51.980> right<00:02:52.100> to

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
speed I can turn it more to the right to

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.140 
speed I can turn it more to the right to
make<00:02:52.310> it<00:02:52.430> faster<00:02:52.990> or<00:02:53.990> turn<00:02:54.230> more<00:02:54.470> to<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:54.680> left

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
make it faster or turn more to the left

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
make it faster or turn more to the left
to<00:02:56.150> make<00:02:56.270> it<00:02:56.390> a<00:02:56.420> little<00:02:56.540> slower<00:02:56.900> maybe<00:02:59.140> add<00:03:00.140> a

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
to make it a little slower maybe add a

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:08.720 
to make it a little slower maybe add a
little<00:03:00.350> bit<00:03:00.470> of<00:03:00.560> reverb

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.240 

and<00:03:09.599> that<00:03:09.810> quick<00:03:10.080> now<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.530> take<00:03:10.739> it<00:03:10.860> off<00:03:10.980> I<00:03:11.129> can

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
and that quick now to take it off I can

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.250 
and that quick now to take it off I can
go<00:03:11.340> ahead<00:03:11.550> and<00:03:11.670> just<00:03:11.760> turn<00:03:11.940> that<00:03:12.000> MF<00:03:12.870> X<00:03:13.080> and

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
go ahead and just turn that MF X and

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.130 
go ahead and just turn that MF X and
that<00:03:13.349> reverb<00:03:13.590> all<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:14.040> way<00:03:14.099> down<00:03:14.250> to<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.459> left

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
that reverb all the way down to the left

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.690 
that reverb all the way down to the left
and<00:03:16.140> it's<00:03:16.560> back<00:03:16.769> to<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.010> way<00:03:17.129> it<00:03:17.250> was<00:03:17.430> when<00:03:17.580> we

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
and it's back to the way it was when we

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.490 
and it's back to the way it was when we
began<00:03:17.849> there's<00:03:18.750> a<00:03:18.810> couple<00:03:18.989> more<00:03:19.170> effects<00:03:19.410> I

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.520 
of overdrive here a little bit of crunch
in<00:03:33.840> there<00:03:34.280> here's<00:03:35.280> a<00:03:35.340> little<00:03:35.519> bit<00:03:35.610> too<00:03:35.760> much

effects you might want to use on the
vintage<00:04:03.780> EP<00:04:04.319> or<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:04.620> electric<00:04:04.980> pianos<00:04:05.370> and

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
vintage EP or the electric pianos and

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:06.530 
vintage EP or the electric pianos and
there's<00:04:05.790> a<00:04:05.880> lot<00:04:06.030> of<00:04:06.120> different<00:04:06.360> type<00:04:06.510> of

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
there's a lot of different type of

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.380 
there's a lot of different type of
effects<00:04:07.410> but<00:04:07.680> another<00:04:07.890> common<00:04:08.519> one<00:04:08.730> is<00:04:08.910> the

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
effects but another common one is the

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.600 
effects but another common one is the
phaser<00:04:09.690> so<00:04:10.410> I<00:04:10.440> just<00:04:10.739> went<00:04:10.860> in<00:04:10.980> and<00:04:11.190> use<00:04:11.430> my

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
phaser so I just went in and use my

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.240 
phaser so I just went in and use my
cursor<00:04:11.880> cursor<00:04:12.630> down<00:04:12.959> to<00:04:12.989> mfx<00:04:13.590> to<00:04:13.920> highlight

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
cursor cursor down to mfx to highlight

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.550 
cursor cursor down to mfx to highlight
that<00:04:14.430> section<00:04:14.730> and<00:04:15.420> now<00:04:15.600> I<00:04:15.630> just<00:04:15.870> use<00:04:15.989> my<00:04:16.019> value

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
that section and now I just use my value

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.500 
that section and now I just use my value
dial<00:04:16.769> here<00:04:17.160> and<00:04:17.340> kind<00:04:17.880> of<00:04:17.970> went<00:04:18.120> through<00:04:18.180> some

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
dial here and kind of went through some

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
of that and you can see there's a lot of

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.820 
of that and you can see there's a lot of
different<00:04:21.090> type<00:04:21.209> of<00:04:21.359> effects<00:04:21.720> in<00:04:21.959> here<00:04:22.410> which

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830

we're going to go ahead and pull up the

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.640 
we're going to go ahead and pull up the
phaser<00:04:29.460> right<00:04:30.120> here<00:04:30.360> so<00:04:30.539> once<00:04:31.229> again<00:04:31.350> let's

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
phaser right here so once again let's

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.529 
phaser right here so once again let's
start<00:04:31.710> off<00:04:31.950> with<00:04:32.520> the<00:04:32.729> electric<00:04:33.180> piano<00:04:33.419> with

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:33.539 
start off with the electric piano with

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:38.000 
start off with the electric piano with
no<00:04:33.690> effects<00:04:36.050> great<00:04:37.050> now<00:04:37.500> let's<00:04:37.620> go<00:04:37.770> ahead<00:04:37.919> and

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
no effects great now let's go ahead and

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.800 
no effects great now let's go ahead and
bring<00:04:38.100> in<00:04:38.220> that<00:04:38.340> phaser<00:04:41.450> here<00:04:42.450> it<00:04:42.570> kind<00:04:42.750> of

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
bring in that phaser here it kind of

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.480 
bring in that phaser here it kind of
going<00:04:42.990> out<00:04:43.080> of<00:04:43.110> phase<00:04:43.350> right<00:04:43.530> here<00:04:46.100> very<00:04:47.100> quick

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
going out of phase right here very quick

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:57.900 
going out of phase right here very quick
so

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.220 

bring<00:04:58.910> down<00:04:59.060> that<00:04:59.120> phaser<00:04:59.510> a<00:04:59.660> little<00:04:59.870> bit<00:05:00.050> or

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.230 
bring down that phaser a little bit or

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:01.660 
bring down that phaser a little bit or
less<00:05:00.800> now<00:05:00.980> let's<00:05:01.190> go<00:05:01.280> ahead<00:05:01.370> and<00:05:01.550> introduce

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:01.670 
less now let's go ahead and introduce

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:08.320 
less now let's go ahead and introduce
maybe<00:05:02.030> a<00:05:02.150> little<00:05:02.360> bit<00:05:02.510> of<00:05:02.570> delay<00:05:05.410> hear<00:05:06.410> it<00:05:07.330> now

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
maybe a little bit of delay hear it now

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.060 
maybe a little bit of delay hear it now
let's<00:05:08.600> go<00:05:08.720> ahead<00:05:08.840> and<00:05:09.050> play<00:05:09.200> the<00:05:09.500> phaser<00:05:09.710> and

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
let's go ahead and play the phaser and

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.830 
let's go ahead and play the phaser and
the<00:05:10.250> delight<00:05:10.550> together<00:05:10.910> inside<00:05:11.630> that

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
the delight together inside that

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:27.370 
the delight together inside that
electric<00:05:12.170> piano<00:05:12.440> patch<00:05:25.600> very<00:05:26.600> quick<00:05:26.960> now<00:05:27.170> once

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
electric piano patch very quick now once

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:28.780 
electric piano patch very quick now once
again<00:05:27.680> if<00:05:27.800> I<00:05:27.890> wanted<00:05:28.100> to<00:05:28.160> take<00:05:28.310> that<00:05:28.460> effect

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
again if I wanted to take that effect

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.640 
again if I wanted to take that effect
off<00:05:29.000> because<00:05:29.360> sometimes<00:05:29.720> the<00:05:30.200> next<00:05:30.410> song

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
off because sometimes the next song

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.070 
off because sometimes the next song
might<00:05:30.920> not<00:05:31.100> need<00:05:31.340> that<00:05:31.610> effect<00:05:32.210> remember<00:05:33.050> I

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
might not need that effect remember I

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.750 
might not need that effect remember I
just<00:05:33.140> go<00:05:33.350> to<00:05:33.410> my<00:05:33.560> knob<00:05:33.770> turn<00:05:34.100> my<00:05:34.250> delay<00:05:34.520> all<00:05:34.640> the

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
just go to my knob turn my delay all the

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.850 
just go to my knob turn my delay all the
way<00:05:34.820> to<00:05:34.880> the<00:05:35.090> left<00:05:35.330> turn<00:05:35.840> my<00:05:35.990> mfx<00:05:36.500> all<00:05:36.710> the<00:05:36.800> way

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
way to the left turn my mfx all the way

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.870 
way to the left turn my mfx all the way
to<00:05:36.920> the<00:05:37.070> left<00:05:37.220> and<00:05:38.890> we're<00:05:39.890> back<00:05:40.100> to<00:05:40.310> square<00:05:40.340> one

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
to the left and we're back to square one

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.750 
to the left and we're back to square one
very<00:05:41.510> easy<00:05:41.780> now<00:05:42.470> let's<00:05:42.680> do<00:05:42.890> one<00:05:43.190> more<00:05:43.220> sound

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
very easy now let's do one more sound

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.850 
very easy now let's do one more sound
inside<00:05:44.270> the<00:05:44.420> piano<00:05:44.690> section<00:05:44.960> and<00:05:45.320> that's<00:05:45.710> the

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
inside the piano section and that's the

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.220 
inside the piano section and that's the
class<00:05:46.100> sound<00:05:46.460> this<00:05:47.150> is<00:05:47.330> a<00:05:47.360> very<00:05:47.600> fun<00:05:47.900> sound

call little shuck and jive on on the

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.600 
call little shuck and jive on on the
keys<00:05:56.360> so<00:05:57.200> let's<00:05:57.410> start<00:05:57.590> off<00:05:57.620> with<00:05:57.710> the<00:05:58.280> basic

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
keys so let's start off with the basic

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.490 
keys so let's start off with the basic
clav<00:05:58.790> right<00:05:59.090> now<00:06:01.540> now<00:06:02.540> there's<00:06:02.900> two<00:06:03.260> common

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.500 
clav right now now there's two common

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.290 
clav right now now there's two common
effects<00:06:03.920> that<00:06:04.040> we're<00:06:04.190> going<00:06:04.310> to<00:06:04.400> use<00:06:04.820> inside

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
effects that we're going to use inside

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.030 
effects that we're going to use inside
the<00:06:05.360> clap<00:06:05.630> this<00:06:06.170> first<00:06:06.440> one<00:06:06.650> we're<00:06:06.800> going<00:06:06.980> to

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.040 
the clap this first one we're going to

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.590 
the clap this first one we're going to
go<00:06:07.130> ahead<00:06:07.220> and<00:06:07.550> have<00:06:07.940> a<00:06:07.970> little<00:06:08.150> bit<00:06:08.300> of<00:06:08.390> wall

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:08.600 
go ahead and have a little bit of wall

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.420 
go ahead and have a little bit of wall
so<00:06:08.840> you<00:06:08.900> see<00:06:09.170> our<00:06:09.530> engineers<00:06:10.040> have<00:06:10.070> rolling

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430 
so you see our engineers have rolling

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.250 
so you see our engineers have rolling
already<00:06:10.670> decided<00:06:11.060> hey<00:06:11.210> you<00:06:11.420> know<00:06:11.690> a<00:06:11.780> wall<00:06:12.110> is

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:12.260 
already decided hey you know a wall is

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.540 
already decided hey you know a wall is
common<00:06:12.650> for<00:06:12.770> this<00:06:12.920> sound<00:06:13.100> so<00:06:13.280> we're<00:06:13.400> going<00:06:13.490> to

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
common for this sound so we're going to

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.460 
common for this sound so we're going to
automatically<00:06:14.180> include<00:06:14.450> in<00:06:14.840> here<00:06:15.050> so<00:06:15.260> once

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:15.470 
automatically include in here so once

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.670 
automatically include in here so once
again<00:06:15.620> in<00:06:15.920> mfx<00:06:16.790> it's<00:06:17.630> got<00:06:17.810> my<00:06:17.960> wall<00:06:18.200> here<00:06:18.470> so<00:06:18.650> I

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:18.680 
again in mfx it's got my wall here so I

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.610 
again in mfx it's got my wall here so I
go<00:06:18.860> ahead<00:06:18.950> and<00:06:19.280> spin<00:06:19.640> my<00:06:19.850> dial<00:06:20.240> my<00:06:20.690> knob<00:06:20.930> to<00:06:21.590> the

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:21.620 
go ahead and spin my dial my knob to the

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:28.900 
go ahead and spin my dial my knob to the
right<00:06:23.260> here<00:06:24.260> to<00:06:24.380> kick<00:06:24.560> in<00:06:24.710> immediately<00:06:27.910> so

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:28.910 
right here to kick in immediately so

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:39.730 
right here to kick in immediately so
here<00:06:29.450> it<00:06:29.540> is<00:06:38.110> let's<00:06:39.110> go<00:06:39.290> ahead<00:06:39.380> and<00:06:39.590> take<00:06:39.710> it

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:39.740 
here it is let's go ahead and take it

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:48.160 
here it is let's go ahead and take it
out<00:06:45.040> that<00:06:46.040> quick<00:06:46.430> very<00:06:46.970> easy<00:06:47.210> right<00:06:47.570> super

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:48.170 
out that quick very easy right super

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:49.780 
out that quick very easy right super
easy<00:06:48.200> now<00:06:48.860> what<00:06:49.040> if<00:06:49.130> we<00:06:49.220> want<00:06:49.400> to<00:06:49.460> go<00:06:49.520> ahead<00:06:49.610> and

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:49.790 
easy now what if we want to go ahead and

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:51.970 
easy now what if we want to go ahead and
use<00:06:49.880> another<00:06:49.910> effect<00:06:50.780> uh<00:06:50.930> maybe<00:06:51.470> that<00:06:51.740> phase

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:51.980 
use another effect uh maybe that phase

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.590
