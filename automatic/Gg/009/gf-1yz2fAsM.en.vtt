00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.880
 others from minecraft are hubs today 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.070
 I'm here to show you the dr 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.630
 mod let's start right away then let's go to 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.400
 see what this new introduces us 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.289
 fashion this new fashion introduces us 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.680
 of objects to create passages 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.140
 dimensional between one plus size 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.809
 let's say there are two exactly one 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.000
 dimension parallel to minecraft is the 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.379
 standard minecraft sizes let's go 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.070
 to see all the objects he introduces 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.110
 this new fashion 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.710
 the first jet and the world or the world 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.809
 gold serves mainly to say how 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.910
 pass here are these then 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.350
 random structures that are created do not have it 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.780
 I created myself created 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.250
 within the world you see two 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.399
 shades the one where we can 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.960
 pass 49 we cannot think then 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.489
 you will have to check this very well 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.590
 I didn't create it here 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.869
 entering it will take us into a dimension 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.240
 parallel minecraft as you see now 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.000
 found a dungeon a fortune because 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.650
 I was looking around so I couldn't find it in 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.979
 this is what we do 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.560
 we have different let's say now 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.060
 locked you see it exploded above me 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.880
 I should have died in a trap 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.710
 this was a dimensional trap here 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.740
 I don't know what's at this is a black hole 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.619
 let's say a creation of the room 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.360
 and that we have many different rooms 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.850
 moments that take us to different places 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.890
 so be careful not to lose yourself this is 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.220
 our door is official from where we are 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.020
 then we have a basket here you see 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.659
 here all the two heads traps with which 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.640
 in fact it will make everyone burst and therefore 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.220
 we will also find these d'angeles if not 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.600
 we could create new ones see also the 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.579
 rift blade which is the new object 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.700
 introduced this ways we also have 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:02.189
 then the hole full of traps them 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.710
 you fall 18 now I show you and say a 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.869
 void you see then we will die 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.030
 logically made on purpose because series 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.830
 cable here is some stone that we had the 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.710
 so here is this very stone 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.180
 particular 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.100
 we can try to get into one 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.650
 whatever size it will take you see 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.350
 in many other dungeons then from a 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.930
 dungeon nor will we think of many others 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.270
 I don't know if there's a fee now 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.140
 because I would n't want to miss this then 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.340
 is the first addition of this fashion that is 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.860
 holy cow and now started for the 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.380
 I saw hallucinations I swear that I 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.480
 saw a name down there under the infinite 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.710
 oh well never mind still rising 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.460
 now back to our dimension 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.930
 normal 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.450
 I advise you to put I do not know 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.990
 waypoint something especially racing 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.790
 tour 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.520
 this is where the use ares back 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.950
 of the riff signature we say very useful 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.710
 4 iron ingot is an under pearl in 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.840
 right-clicking which I love 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:58.180
 let's create a type I don't know how to call it a 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.920
 we can remove a bookmark 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.020
 through the riff we will keep ver that done 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.780
 the same way except for golding 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.510
 clicking on it with the right button 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.760
 let's say the pale rifters so i'm 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.280
 speaking of the world of the world orson 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.290
 of the normal doors that will have one 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.290
 shape the doors until we use 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:22.660
 above them the rizzi network then 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:24.370
 this looks is not ok, we pass by 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.330
 through how you see we use it 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.330
 only as a port 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.590
 ok this the world tour and now see 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.750
 instead she stable store liste bol d'or is 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.340
 a door or something wrong is the door 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.290
 a little more complex makes you with two 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.610
 glowing dimensions and a fender intact 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.760
 I also show the dimensions so far 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.349
 that is, with two roundels to make pearls what 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.620
 this door will do this instead 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:51.750
 will spawn areas and random you see now 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.569
 I don't know why here is this door 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:57.090
 will make you play random now ops or ho 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.310
 wrong ok digit spar training us 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.440
 we will enter this door will transport us 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.720
 let's say random is not much random 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:07.079
 although we can define it enough 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:10.739
 nano you see now the place where i'm ok 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:13.139
 there you see it ok now I go here should 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:16.320
 bring me back I hope not yet there indeed 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:19.979
 brought me back to another place you see 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.599
 here it has returned to its initial place 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:23.789
 of the unstable so if we put 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:25.410
 many will take us to random places 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:27.479
 so this remind you that one 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.919
 jarred structure causally we go 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:31.229
 now instead to see the dimension ad 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:33.900
 now the size now the position 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:36.380
 i love and has already got everything included let's say 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.120
 this really brings the size 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.370
 additional we can build here the 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:45.349
 I do n't know about any house 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:47.880
 object look if I show you 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:50.099
 we can do everything only that 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.500
 we can paint on the floor because 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:54.690
 we should first occupy the space of the 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.630
 floor will be positioned automatically 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.970
 see also putting it as we say 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.979
 block here because there was built up above 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.150
 if we put here you see that there is a type 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:04.320
 a floor 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.300
 if we put it in the place of 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.630
 floor always builds them below 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.520
 that is, it occupies the dark space before we go 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.889
 now to see the latest introduced in 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.810
 this is the rift play of the rift 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:17.430
 valley thesis scratch with two under skin is 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.490
 a raise the remover we can 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.500
 use it if as we say sword for 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.300
 however, teleporting will serve us mob ci 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.669
 we could teleport from the new one 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.889
 look I click next to the chicken e 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:31.260
 let's face it will continue to bring close to 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:33.510
 polo then only works on new ones 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.680
 look at me all died now 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.539
 squibb 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.700
 ok try the chicken look I'm here 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:40.220
 I click on the chicken will take me close 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.660
 only works on mobs 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.160
 we can use it as a mini technique 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:46.280
 we need to be teleporting 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:48.260
 enough of the neighbors you see tac 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.970
 ok but what is needed above all this 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:53.000
 meanwhile, woman is very strong 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.560
 I try to use a moment now on a 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.770
 creeper we find on a clip air for 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.060
 see its power 18 the clipper 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.350
 even with a diamond spa not 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:05.030
 focus dies in two or three shots 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:07.760
 let's see with this 123 ok let's say that 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.140
 it is quite strong and what is needed 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.270
 this sword to create strong e 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:14.270
 dimensional look we can create 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:16.850
 a door let's say super-fast DIY 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.980
 that is, we can create many 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:22.070
 look then I do not know if the world the fair 

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:23.660
 but we can really create so many not 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.820
 I don't even know how to delete them 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.380
 I have to tell you I try to hit it or a 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.570
 doing so and not canceling them creates them 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:32.450
 another one, however, as you can see passing by 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:34.280
 inside we will always go this dimension 

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:36.800
 unfortunately, however, in this dimension it is not 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.810
 there will be the passage as you will see there will be 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.000
 only reeves that we can always 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.470
 delete by rid 3 move and by 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.750
 we will have to return to the other dimension 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:47.720
 always make a portal in this e 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:49.580
 we will return to the other as you can see though 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.710
 the lead now there is there are 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.110
 still all and this rift was formed 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:56.750
 the black rift if we don't remove it through 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.700
 the 3 move riff will create many 

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.979
 now I'll show you a moment 

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:02.660
 spurring them on to many in the neighborhood 

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:04.790
 3 move that will destroy ours 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.470
 world and they will make many sounds 

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.780
 at least now I'll show you 

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:10.370
 see that there are already some though 

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.820
 the sand can not see it well 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:14.830
 use on earth look 

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:17.770
 they destroy our world and we will remain 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:19.450
 so they are not really good 

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:21.730
 so it is better to do a few dimension to 

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:23.470
 now anyway guys this is all 

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:25.690
 that introduces this new fashion I will 

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:27.580
 remember to put it like the 100 mi 

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.780
 like to publish new fashions fashions 

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.610
 channel to stay up to date on 

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:32.260
 come out we will see you on 

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:35.040
 next video missed the mod 

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.040
 hello everyone guys
