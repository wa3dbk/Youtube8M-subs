00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.800 

so<00:00:01.290> what<00:00:01.439> we're<00:00:01.589> looking<00:00:01.620> at<00:00:01.979> right<00:00:02.159> now<00:00:02.810> it's

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
so what we're looking at right now it's

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.730 
so what we're looking at right now it's
pretty<00:00:04.080> much<00:00:05.540> the<00:00:06.540> original<00:00:06.990> look<00:00:07.170> wouldn't

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
pretty much the original look wouldn't

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.629 
pretty much the original look wouldn't
force<00:00:08.040> and<00:00:09.019> lately<00:00:10.019> they<00:00:10.380> started<00:00:10.800> buckling

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
force and lately they started buckling

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.100 
force and lately they started buckling
I'm<00:00:11.790> not<00:00:12.000> sure<00:00:12.150> we<00:00:12.269> can<00:00:12.420> really<00:00:12.630> see<00:00:12.870> it<00:00:12.960> from

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
I'm not sure we can really see it from

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.490 
I'm not sure we can really see it from
this<00:00:13.290> video<00:00:13.940> but<00:00:14.940> it<00:00:15.450> seems<00:00:15.719> like<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.020> force

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
this video but it seems like the force

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.359 
this video but it seems like the force
are<00:00:16.680> popping<00:00:17.010> up

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
are popping up

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.929 
are popping up
and<00:00:18.109> so<00:00:19.109> it's<00:00:19.529> kind<00:00:19.650> of<00:00:19.770> bewildered<00:00:19.890> at<00:00:20.580> first

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
and so it's kind of bewildered at first

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.170 
and so it's kind of bewildered at first
why<00:00:21.380> and<00:00:22.380> as<00:00:23.070> you<00:00:23.250> can<00:00:23.369> see<00:00:23.430> here<00:00:23.850> these<00:00:24.119> are

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
why and as you can see here these are

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.109 
why and as you can see here these are
parquet<00:00:24.779> floors<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:26.490> seems<00:00:26.730> like<00:00:26.939> the

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
parquet floors and it seems like the

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.069 
parquet floors and it seems like the
individual<00:00:29.510> tiles<00:00:30.510> per<00:00:30.750> se<00:00:30.960> just<00:00:31.730> started

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
individual tiles per se just started

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.389 
individual tiles per se just started
popping<00:00:34.079> up<00:00:34.440> so<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:34.710> can<00:00:34.890> really<00:00:35.010> feel<00:00:35.340> it

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
popping up so you can really feel it

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.490 
popping up so you can really feel it
when<00:00:35.520> you<00:00:35.760> walk<00:00:35.910> through<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.239> floor<00:00:36.500> that

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
when you walk through the floor that

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
when you walk through the floor that
there's<00:00:37.680> something<00:00:38.040> sticking<00:00:38.280> up<00:00:39.320> and<00:00:40.520> the

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
there's something sticking up and the

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.510 
there's something sticking up and the
reason<00:00:41.790> meaning<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.920> guess<00:00:43.920> this<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.250> the

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
reason meaning is I guess this is the

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.790 
reason meaning is I guess this is the
air<00:00:45.090> handler<00:00:45.510> training<00:00:46.050> air<00:00:46.260> handler<00:00:46.680> it

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
air handler training air handler it

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.430 
air handler training air handler it
started<00:00:47.129> leaking<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:48.829> this<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.010> fairly<00:00:50.789> old

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
started leaking and this is a fairly old

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.580 
started leaking and this is a fairly old
system<00:00:52.440> from<00:00:53.010> what<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.210> aec<00:00:55.050> guy<00:00:55.199> told<00:00:55.469> me

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
system from what the aec guy told me

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.060 
system from what the aec guy told me
previously<00:00:56.239> this<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.420> about<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:59.149> 1987<00:01:00.149> model<00:01:01.070> as

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
previously this is about a 1987 model as

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.570 
previously this is about a 1987 model as
you<00:01:02.280> can<00:01:02.399> see<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:03.199> put<00:01:04.199> some<00:01:04.860> paper<00:01:05.070> tell<00:01:05.430> us

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
you can see I put some paper tell us

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.260 
you can see I put some paper tell us
here<00:01:05.850> just<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.330> kind<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:08.030> prevent<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.240> from

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
here just to kind of prevent it from

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.840 
here just to kind of prevent it from
getting<00:01:09.869> any<00:01:10.200> worse<00:01:10.290> but<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.220> know<00:01:11.460> that's<00:01:11.729> not

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
getting any worse but I know that's not

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.940 
getting any worse but I know that's not
going<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.030> fix<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.390> issue<00:01:15.860> when<00:01:16.860> you're

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
going to fix that issue when you're

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.740 
going to fix that issue when you're
seeing<00:01:17.250> here<00:01:17.400> now<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.640> can<00:01:17.820> guess<00:01:18.119> those<00:01:18.540> are

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
seeing here now I can guess those are

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.800 
seeing here now I can guess those are
two<00:01:18.840> drain<00:01:19.080> pipes<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:20.420> I<00:01:21.420> see<00:01:21.659> another

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
two drain pipes and I see another

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.810 
two drain pipes and I see another
YouTube<00:01:22.290> video<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:22.680> figure<00:01:23.189> that's<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.580> but

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
YouTube video so figure that's it but

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.260 
YouTube video so figure that's it but
this<00:01:24.659> what<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:24.990> bottom<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.439> looks<00:01:25.680> like<00:01:25.920> I

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
this what the bottom that looks like I

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.710 
this what the bottom that looks like I
guess<00:01:27.270> these<00:01:27.570> two<00:01:27.630> pipes<00:01:29.600> connected<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.689> to

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
guess these two pipes connected it to

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.870 
guess these two pipes connected it to
the<00:01:30.930> white<00:01:31.140> PVC<00:01:31.860> pipes<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.549> see<00:01:32.759> up

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
the white PVC pipes that you see up

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.780 
the white PVC pipes that you see up
front<00:01:35.509> it's<00:01:36.509> kind<00:01:36.720> of<00:01:36.780> dirty<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.490> yeah<00:01:38.490> do<00:01:38.549> you

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
front it's kind of dirty and yeah do you

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.050 
front it's kind of dirty and yeah do you
need<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.060> clean<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:40.220> I'll<00:01:41.220> do<00:01:41.670> so<00:01:42.860> but<00:01:44.060> the

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
need to clean it so I'll do so but the

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.480 
need to clean it so I'll do so but the
leaks<00:01:45.329> are<00:01:45.570> pretty<00:01:45.780> much<00:01:45.899> coming<00:01:46.170> out<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:47.509> this

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
leaks are pretty much coming out of this

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.399 
leaks are pretty much coming out of this
that's<00:01:50.490> dripping<00:01:50.880> slowly<00:01:51.450> I'm<00:01:51.960> not<00:01:52.229> sure<00:01:52.350> if

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
that's dripping slowly I'm not sure if

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.990 
that's dripping slowly I'm not sure if
you<00:01:52.530> do<00:01:52.680> see<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.009> but<00:01:53.159> there's<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.430> water<00:01:53.670> drop

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
you do see it but there's a water drop

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.080 
you do see it but there's a water drop
there<00:01:55.189> droplet<00:01:56.189> I<00:01:56.219> mean<00:01:56.430> that's<00:01:56.610> about<00:01:56.820> to

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
there droplet I mean that's about to

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.459 
there droplet I mean that's about to
drop<00:01:57.810> on<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.079> floor

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:02.719 

I've<00:02:01.469> been<00:02:01.619> looking<00:02:01.890> at<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.070> YouTube<00:02:02.399> videos

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
I've been looking at the YouTube videos

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.760 
I've been looking at the YouTube videos
and<00:02:02.939> they<00:02:03.060> said<00:02:03.299> that<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:04.380> can<00:02:04.530> pretty<00:02:04.680> much

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
and they said that you can pretty much

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.499 
and they said that you can pretty much
you<00:02:05.250> know<00:02:05.340> clear<00:02:05.729> out<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.000> drain<00:02:06.210> your<00:02:06.360> own

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
you know clear out the drain your own

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.690 
you know clear out the drain your own
but<00:02:06.780> my<00:02:07.560> model<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:08.009> can't<00:02:08.340> seem<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.580> find

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
but my model I can't seem to find

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.040 
but my model I can't seem to find
a<00:02:10.300> place<00:02:10.959> to<00:02:11.170> eat<00:02:11.230> I<00:02:11.410> put<00:02:11.620> tablets<00:02:12.190> or<00:02:13.050> the

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
a place to eat I put tablets or the

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.229 
a place to eat I put tablets or the
bleach<00:02:14.769> to<00:02:15.459> clear<00:02:16.239> it<00:02:16.390> out<00:02:17.819> so<00:02:18.819> this<00:02:18.940> is<00:02:19.000> just

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
bleach to clear it out so this is just

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.690 
bleach to clear it out so this is just
an<00:02:19.450> overall<00:02:19.780> D<00:02:20.440> of<00:02:20.650> what<00:02:20.860> my<00:02:21.010> system<00:02:21.489> looks

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
an overall D of what my system looks

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.930 
an overall D of what my system looks
like<00:02:22.830> once<00:02:23.830> again<00:02:24.069> it's<00:02:24.190> a<00:02:24.250> training<00:02:24.550> model<00:02:24.910> I

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
like once again it's a training model I

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.940 
like once again it's a training model I
mean<00:02:25.180> that<00:02:25.390> can<00:02:25.510> make<00:02:25.690> seven<00:02:26.050> and<00:02:26.200> this<00:02:26.800> is

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
mean that can make seven and this is

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.830 
mean that can make seven and this is

what right here and just notice it I'm
not<00:02:29.050> really<00:02:29.170> sure<00:02:29.440> what<00:02:29.590> it's<00:02:29.709> for

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
not really sure what it's for

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.420 
not really sure what it's for
but<00:02:30.489> I<00:02:30.519> figured<00:02:30.910> you<00:02:31.000> know<00:02:31.150> I'll<00:02:32.140> just<00:02:32.590> shoot<00:02:33.099> a

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
but I figured you know I'll just shoot a

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.000 
but I figured you know I'll just shoot a
video<00:02:33.790> and<00:02:34.300> that<00:02:34.420> way<00:02:34.630> you<00:02:34.690> guys<00:02:34.989> can<00:02:35.050> give<00:02:35.920> me

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
video and that way you guys can give me

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.089 
video and that way you guys can give me
an<00:02:36.099> idea<00:02:36.370> on<00:02:36.459> what<00:02:36.519> the<00:02:36.849> switches<00:02:37.750> for<00:02:37.780> if<00:02:38.530> it

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
an idea on what the switches for if it

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:41.250 
an idea on what the switches for if it
will<00:02:39.280> really<00:02:39.790> help<00:02:40.030> with<00:02:40.209> the<00:02:40.390> water<00:02:40.870> draining

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
will really help with the water draining

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.220 
will really help with the water draining
or<00:02:41.440> not<00:02:42.180> so<00:02:43.180> this<00:02:43.330> is<00:02:43.450> what<00:02:43.599> my<00:02:43.720> system<00:02:44.049> looks

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
or not so this is what my system looks

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.940 
or not so this is what my system looks
like<00:02:44.410> the<00:02:45.010> drain<00:02:45.370> I<00:02:45.580> don't<00:02:46.120> see<00:02:46.269> any<00:02:46.420> pen<00:02:46.950> that

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
like the drain I don't see any pen that

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.740 
like the drain I don't see any pen that
catches<00:02:48.400> or<00:02:48.579> you<00:02:48.940> know<00:02:49.060> dream<00:02:49.390> kind<00:02:49.569> of

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
catches or you know dream kind of

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.350 
catches or you know dream kind of
catches<00:02:50.049> the<00:02:50.200> water<00:02:50.410> here<00:02:53.459> PVC<00:02:54.459> pipe<00:02:54.790> goes<00:02:55.090> all

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
catches the water here PVC pipe goes all

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.039 
catches the water here PVC pipe goes all
the<00:02:55.390> way<00:02:55.540> outside<00:02:55.989> so<00:02:57.390> not<00:02:58.390> really<00:02:58.630> sure<00:02:58.840> if<00:02:58.930> it

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
the way outside so not really sure if it

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.949 
the way outside so not really sure if it
leads<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.410> outside<00:02:59.980> or<00:03:00.480> but<00:03:01.480> it's<00:03:01.720> trading

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
leads to outside or but it's trading

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.410 
leads to outside or but it's trading
somewhere
