00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
started both of the same well as it's

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.310 
started both of the same well as it's
often<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.200> case<00:00:37.230> well<00:00:37.620> look<00:00:37.950> at<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.100> bottles

almost<00:00:40.640> identical<00:00:41.640> personally<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.510> think

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
almost identical personally I think

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.660

sports<00:00:43.170> extreme<00:00:43.440> wins<00:00:43.829> for<00:00:44.040> battle<00:00:44.280> design<00:00:44.550> I

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
sports extreme wins for battle design I

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.549

just<00:00:44.700> prefer<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.239> bottle<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.750> think<00:00:46.170> in<00:00:46.260> darker

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
just prefer the bottle I think in darker

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.690 
just prefer the bottle I think in darker
shade<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:46.770> gray<00:00:47.039> makes<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.340> look<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.520> bit<00:00:47.550> more

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
shade of gray makes it look a bit more

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.970 
shade of gray makes it look a bit more
mature<00:00:47.969> we<00:00:48.750> know<00:00:48.930> one<00:00:49.140> still<00:00:49.379> great<00:00:49.649> as<00:00:49.890> you
