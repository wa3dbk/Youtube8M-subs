00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.999
 these cookies are a fantastic gift 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.709
 for christmas for teachers for 

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:09.290
 friends for grandparents for all 

00:00:06.709 --> 00:00:10.700
 we make white cookie dough and the 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.680
 half of the mass is colored by moss 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.780
 cocoa powder so that it is colored 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.279
 chocolate also stops chocolate and 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.169
 now see how easy we are going to do 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.359
 buttons with a cutter we make the 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:22.699
 off circle then we turn 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:25.369
 a smaller cutter and we mark not 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:28.369
 we pierce the circle of the center and with 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:31.399
 the mouth of a blade we do what 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.530
 are buttonholes the holes 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:37.010
 of the button we do the same with the dough 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.050
 of chocolate mark we insist on there is no 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.610
 what to cut you just have to mark the part 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.070
 inside the button and with a mouthpiece 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.530
 we make the holes we can do it 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.540
 also with a good soda straw 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.520
 We bake as always at 200 degrees 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.530
 for 7 minutes and we already have the 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.820
 cookies two colors white and 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.740
 the chocolate 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.410
 now we are putting alternating and what 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.000
 let's do is pass them a little 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.310
 previously linked what we have washed has 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.009
 to be all very very hygienic because 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:06.290
 to fix you, we just have to be 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:06.800
 our buttons we are passing the loop 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.460
 by 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:13.370
 different holes of the buttons 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:18.190
 first one side very well and now we pass 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.190
 the other back side forward 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.880
 this can not be easier but it remains 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.909
 very funny as well as it is so little 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:28.780
 seen then the truth is that it is an idea 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:31.470
 Original well as we have already spent see 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.560
 and we stretch so that the loop 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.260
 this tense and now we are left to 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.150
 make a loop these cookies and or 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.740
 they would put in a cellophane in a bag of 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.560
 cellophane or something like that but all together 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.350
 of course you are going to deliver us just like that but 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.370
 the presentation is of course very 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.860
 funny now we cut what we have left 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.360
 of the bows so that the loop is 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.250
 adjusted 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.690
 Well more if they have not stayed 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.160
 make a few packets one that starts 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.400
 by white and chocolate and the other by 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.400
 reverse
