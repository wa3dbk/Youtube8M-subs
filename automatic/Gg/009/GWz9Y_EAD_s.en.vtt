00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:08.069
 the gospel in three minutes with mario 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.990
 person in the woods and Maria in the 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.480
 chapter 10 and lucas we saw the 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.500
 importance of being always close to 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.220
 Jesus 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.380
 listening to your word, chapter 11 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:23.039
 begins by showing how we should avoid 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:26.460
 a disciple of Jesus praying and feels that 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:30.119
 must do the same Lord teach us to 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.160
 pray skin and jesus he maybe not yet 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.070
 be aware that you are facing the 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.739
 own son of god the creator of 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.129
 universe and that your request is the same 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.710
 which is a prayer and soon attended to before 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.050
 to get into the details of how to cure 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.450
 You have to understand some things you 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.960
 finds in the bible people praying to God 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.620
 in a general sense to the father a sense 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:59.910
 particular as jesus will teach here 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.629
 and jesus the son but you never find 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.040
 someone looking at the holy spirit 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.850
 therefore to address the holy spirit 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.110
 to pray praise or worship do not have 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.390
 biblical foundation 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.740
 even though he is one of the three 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.200
 people of the trinity 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.950
 Another important point is what Jesus 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.220
 teaches and matheus 67 chapter 6 verse 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.650
 7 and when you pray do not always 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.909
 repeating the same thing as the 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.280
 pagan 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.920
 the repetitions also known as 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.049
 prayers can be found in the 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.520
 Eastern pagan religions but has no 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.770
 biblical foundation 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.259
 could anyone claim that in the 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.899
 getsêmani jesus used repetitions 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.290
 when he looked for the third time saying 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.960
 the same words are in matus 26 44 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.750
 but the difference is clear a prayer 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.840
 repetitive phrases are used pre 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.939
 defined prefabricated that have 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.719
 relationship with the need of that 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.909
 time 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.549
 the sentences are used as words 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.880
 and not with the help request 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:08.310
 Prayer is already a conversation with God. 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.020
 specific application, there is no 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.300
 It is not wrong to present a 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.470
 request again with the same 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.030
 words 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.820
 You tire when you want to win a toy. 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.310
 she keeps repeating her desire until she 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.920
 answered she does not take a generic phrase 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.780
 to repeat for their parents they would not know 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.390
 what present give me 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.520
 Another argument is that many prayers are 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.610
 biblical passages and bring much 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.120
 benefit when repeated for repeat 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.710
 The Word of God is not talking to God. 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.890
 Did you hear what he says? 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:43.980
 a prayer is to speak with him to remember the 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.459
 mercy his mercy his grace 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.530
 and also present our difficulties 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:50.190
 weaknesses and needs like these 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.830
 things 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.610
 differ from person to person 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.620
 there are not even two prayers 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.980
 completely identical but if so 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.900
 because Jesus teaches that our father who 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.990
 is repeated by thousands of people 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.770
 would not be teaching a prayer to be 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.640
 repeated 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:15.390
 it is not enough for you to compare this passage from 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:18.420
 chapter 6 of chapter 11 of lucas with the 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.580
 passage from chapter 6 and matheus to 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.890
 to note that they are different 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.100
 the holy spirit showed how Jesus 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.560
 was teaching the disciples aurá and 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.870
 not giving them a script to be 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.330
 repeated details and avenues 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:37.310
 instructions given by jesus we will see 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:40.380
