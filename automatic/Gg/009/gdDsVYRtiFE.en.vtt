00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.910
 so I don't want to go anywhere 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.850
 I saw that Mauser gave 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.430
 somehow long ago took off to ride there 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.390
 there somehow 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.980
 identify someone 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.980
 and pasha and unpacking 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.480
 and sanyo 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.520
 but 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.520
 it sent began to seem 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.690
 of course 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:03.390
 just live well how to expect 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:05.640
 very good 40 but really 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:10.320
 car's maximum speed somewhere 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.790
 200 kilometers per hour though plunges 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.920
 power 300 but power density 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.120
 small so these after i have to 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.120
 put teams balance 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.610
 often decent 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.660
 they all feel the sole rather 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.150
 has gone 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.439
 instead of the way well she is so long 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.439
 arose 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.799
 glad to help 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.970
 at least one more thing that's when this 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:50.300
 car ride 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.490
 on the road you literally them you 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.790
 feel that you are your rest 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.410
 without them you are not only burning straight but 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.460
 and come in but stock because it is not 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.860
 just sitting more 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.080
 answer or feel higher because 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.420
 that he all drive on these stones you don't 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.660
 those people who are already something in life 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:12.140
 drowned maybe more than i already 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:15.490
 soil but why why now for any I 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:18.640

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:21.130
 this is Masha and 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.819
 and that someone is me that his deputy is 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:27.850
 hard to guess 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:29.950
 like this in 10 minutes you will need 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:34.270
 to give the machine so that there is exactly 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:39.580

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.780
