triple A batteries for the controller

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.979 
triple A batteries for the controller
I'm<00:00:35.790> curious<00:00:36.120> if<00:00:36.450> there's<00:00:36.600> anything<00:00:36.809> else

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
I'm curious if there's anything else

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.780 
I'm curious if there's anything else
under<00:00:37.290> here<00:00:37.469> because<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:38.129> feel<00:00:38.489> like<00:00:38.520> they

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
under here because I feel like they

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.110 
under here because I feel like they
should<00:00:38.820> be<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.420> record<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.710> some<00:00:41.070> type<00:00:41.370> but

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
should be a record of some type but

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.299 
should be a record of some type but
maybe<00:00:42.329> not<00:00:42.540> because<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.649> assume<00:00:43.890> we<00:00:44.100> have<00:00:44.129> to

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
maybe not because I assume we have to

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.340 
maybe not because I assume we have to
plug<00:00:44.550> this<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:44.969> somewhere<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:45.960> assume<00:00:46.230> we

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
plug this in somewhere so I assume we

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.690 
plug this in somewhere so I assume we
need<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> court<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:46.890> some<00:00:47.100> type<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.460> I'm<00:00:47.550> not

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
need a court of some type and I'm not

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.330 
need a court of some type and I'm not
seeing<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.860> cord<00:00:51.050> so<00:00:52.050> that's<00:00:52.980> what<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.219> actually

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
seeing a cord so that's what I actually

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.560 
seeing a cord so that's what I actually
came<00:00:53.610> in<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.820> box<00:00:53.969> though<00:00:54.180> we're<00:00:54.300> going<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.480> go

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
came in the box though we're going to go

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.000 
came in the box though we're going to go
ahead<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.780> get<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.050> set<00:00:55.199> up<00:00:55.260> later<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:55.980> can

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
ahead and get it set up later so I can

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.029
