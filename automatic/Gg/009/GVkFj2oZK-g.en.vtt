00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.199 
for something and you just use hdmi
sticking<00:02:45.600> through<00:02:45.750> TV<00:02:46.760> whilst<00:02:47.760> we<00:02:47.910> get<00:02:48.060> in<00:02:48.150> the

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
sticking through TV whilst we get in the

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:56.090 
sticking through TV whilst we get in the
box<00:02:50.330> true<00:02:51.770> true<00:02:53.239> okay<00:02:54.239> or<00:02:54.420> like<00:02:54.450> this<00:02:54.840> it's<00:02:55.680> the

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
box true true okay or like this it's the

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.220 
box true true okay or like this it's the
USB<00:02:56.580> to<00:02:56.730> mini-usb<00:02:57.000> to<00:02:57.690> power<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:59.270> dongle<00:03:00.270> more

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
USB to mini-usb to power the dongle more

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.990 
USB to mini-usb to power the dongle more
than<00:03:01.350> likely<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:02.280> can<00:03:02.430> probably<00:03:02.580> just<00:03:02.760> plug

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
than likely you can probably just plug

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.960 
than likely you can probably just plug
this<00:03:03.120> into<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:04.110> USB<00:03:04.530> port<00:03:04.709> on<00:03:05.010> your<00:03:05.070> TV<00:03:05.220> so<00:03:05.880> you

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
this into the USB port on your TV so you

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.550 
this into the USB port on your TV so you
probably<00:03:06.180> won't<00:03:06.390> need<00:03:06.450> to<00:03:06.720> plug<00:03:07.170> this<00:03:07.260> into<00:03:07.440> a

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
probably won't need to plug this into a

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.120 
probably won't need to plug this into a
next<00:03:07.709> extra<00:03:08.700> power<00:03:09.060> slot<00:03:09.930> yeah<00:03:10.560> just<00:03:10.769> plug<00:03:11.010> it

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
next extra power slot yeah just plug it

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.160 
next extra power slot yeah just plug it
into<00:03:11.250> your<00:03:11.340> TV<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:12.000> more<00:03:12.660> than<00:03:12.720> likely<00:03:12.780> it'll

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
into your TV and more than likely it'll

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.680 
into your TV and more than likely it'll
be<00:03:13.230> enough<00:03:13.470> to<00:03:13.620> power<00:03:13.799> the<00:03:13.950> device<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:14.690> will

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
be enough to power the device and will

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.720 
be enough to power the device and will
be<00:03:15.870> a<00:03:15.900> cleaner<00:03:16.650> set<00:03:16.890> up<00:03:17.010> they<00:03:17.459> won't<00:03:17.640> have

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
be a cleaner set up they won't have

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.229 
be a cleaner set up they won't have
