00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
phone like that you can see that 3.0 USB

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.280 
phone like that you can see that 3.0 USB
goes<00:01:01.649> right<00:01:01.859> in<00:01:01.980> here<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:03.180> let's<00:01:03.750> go<00:01:03.989> ahead<00:01:04.049> and

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
goes right in here so let's go ahead and

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.500 
goes right in here so let's go ahead and
do<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.589> can<00:01:04.739> see<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:04.949> this<00:01:05.240> jams<00:01:06.240> up

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
do that you can see that this jams up

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.140 
do that you can see that this jams up
down<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.560> guess<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:07.979> can<00:01:08.189> actually<00:01:08.460> put<00:01:08.820> the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
down I guess so I can actually put the

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.990 
down I guess so I can actually put the
phone<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:09.930> here<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.520> only<00:01:11.670> thing<00:01:11.850> that

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.830 
this obviously is not gonna hold any
water<00:01:34.530> out<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.189> I<00:01:36.030> mean<00:01:36.270> that's<00:01:36.420> pretty<00:01:36.600> much<00:01:36.780> a

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
water out so I mean that's pretty much a

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.730 
water out so I mean that's pretty much a
little<00:01:37.140> downfall<00:01:37.680> already<00:01:38.840> anyways<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.680> it

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
little downfall already anyways so it

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.170 
little downfall already anyways so it
looks<00:01:40.890> like<00:01:40.920> basically<00:01:41.400> how<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.610> put<00:01:41.850> this<00:01:41.970> in

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
looks like basically how you put this in

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.810 
looks like basically how you put this in
you<00:01:42.299> just<00:01:42.420> put<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.720> in<00:01:42.810> like<00:01:42.930> this<00:01:43.729> let<00:01:44.729> me

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
you just put it in like this let me

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.530 
you just put it in like this let me
slowly<00:01:45.030> bring<00:01:45.509> this<00:01:45.600> down<00:01:46.759> okay<00:01:47.759> that<00:01:48.060> was<00:01:48.210> I

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
slowly bring this down okay that was I

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.780 
slowly bring this down okay that was I
think<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.290> was<00:01:49.439> pretty<00:01:49.619> easy<00:01:49.710> pretty<00:01:50.220> went

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
think that was pretty easy pretty went

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.030 
think that was pretty easy pretty went
in<00:01:50.880> pretty<00:01:51.090> smoothly<00:01:51.590> but<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:52.680> can<00:01:52.799> see<00:01:52.890> that

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
in pretty smoothly but you can see that

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.469 
in pretty smoothly but you can see that
there's<00:01:53.220> some<00:01:53.340> space<00:01:53.640> up<00:01:53.850> here<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.360> now<00:01:54.450> I

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
there's some space up here and now I

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.030 
there's some space up here and now I
think<00:01:54.570> once<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.049> slide<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:55.439> in<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.710> can<00:01:55.799> kind

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
think once you slide it in you can kind

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:03.670 
think once you slide it in you can kind
of<00:01:57.200> there<00:01:58.460> now<00:01:59.460> it's<00:01:59.729> like<00:02:01.399> flush

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
of there now it's like flush

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.460 
of there now it's like flush
you<00:02:04.680> can<00:02:04.830> see<00:02:06.290> looks<00:02:07.290> pretty<00:02:07.530> good

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
you can see looks pretty good

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.700 
you can see looks pretty good
here's<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.530> little<00:02:10.740> kickstand<00:02:12.320> just<00:02:13.320> like<00:02:13.470> this

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
here's a little kickstand just like this

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.770 
here's a little kickstand just like this
put<00:02:13.980> my<00:02:14.070> phone<00:02:14.340> on<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:18.120> only<00:02:18.300> thing<00:02:18.450> is<00:02:18.570> I<00:02:18.660> mean

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
put my phone on the only thing is I mean

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.050 
put my phone on the only thing is I mean
is<00:02:19.140> definitely<00:02:19.620> like<00:02:19.740> a<00:02:19.770> lot<00:02:20.040> thicker<00:02:20.370> I<00:02:20.760> mean

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.490 
is definitely like a lot thicker I mean
I<00:02:21.330> think<00:02:21.450> this<00:02:21.630> is<00:02:21.780> thicker<00:02:22.020> that<00:02:22.230> actually

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
I think this is thicker that actually

I think this is thicker that actually

supposedly<00:03:59.310> what<00:03:59.670> it<00:03:59.790> does<00:04:00.000> is<00:04:00.420> it<00:04:00.959> charges

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
supposedly what it does is it charges

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.870 
supposedly what it does is it charges
your<00:04:01.470> phone<00:04:01.500> up<00:04:01.829> to<00:04:01.860> 100<00:04:02.250> cent<00:04:02.400> first<00:04:02.670> and

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
your phone up to 100 cent first and

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.690 
your phone up to 100 cent first and
after<00:04:03.150> that<00:04:03.269> if<00:04:03.510> I<00:04:03.600> charge<00:04:03.930> this<00:04:04.890> back<00:04:05.459> plate

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
after that if I charge this back plate

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.530 
after that if I charge this back plate
as<00:04:06.000> well<00:04:07.130> so<00:04:08.130> the<00:04:08.400> only<00:04:08.519> thing<00:04:08.730> is<00:04:08.880> I<00:04:09.060> mean<00:04:09.209> it's

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
as well so the only thing is I mean it's

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.259 
as well so the only thing is I mean it's
pretty<00:04:09.780> heavy<00:04:09.989> here<00:04:10.380> it's<00:04:10.980> definitely<00:04:11.269> pretty

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
pretty heavy here it's definitely pretty

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.150 
pretty heavy here it's definitely pretty
thick

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.240 

I<00:04:15.720> don't<00:04:16.720> know<00:04:16.810> it<00:04:16.930> seems<00:04:17.200> really<00:04:17.620> heavy<00:04:17.920> but

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
I don't know it seems really heavy but

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.630 
I don't know it seems really heavy but
if<00:04:18.370> you<00:04:18.400> want<00:04:18.640> doubles<00:04:18.970> a<00:04:19.030> life<00:04:19.239> I<00:04:20.459> guess<00:04:21.459> this

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
if you want doubles a life I guess this

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.740 
if you want doubles a life I guess this
would<00:04:21.760> be<00:04:21.880> for<00:04:22.180> you

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
would be for you

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.300 
would be for you
I'm<00:04:22.990> not<00:04:23.230> sure<00:04:23.440> this<00:04:23.620> is<00:04:23.740> for<00:04:23.890> me<00:04:24.010> or<00:04:24.130> not<00:04:24.250> but

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
I'm not sure this is for me or not but

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.830 
I'm not sure this is for me or not but
anyways<00:04:24.730> I<00:04:24.880> don't<00:04:24.940> know<00:04:25.120> right<00:04:25.480> now<00:04:25.600> I<00:04:25.630> get

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
through a wonderful day I haven't tried

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.920 
through a wonderful day I haven't tried
this<00:04:30.550> out<00:04:30.730> yes<00:04:30.970> I'm<00:04:31.120> gonna<00:04:31.240> try<00:04:31.420> this<00:04:31.480> out<00:04:31.660> and

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
this out yes I'm gonna try this out and

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.960 
this out yes I'm gonna try this out and
I'll<00:04:32.110> make<00:04:32.590> another<00:04:32.770> video<00:04:33.130> in<00:04:33.370> a<00:04:33.430> few<00:04:33.580> days<00:04:33.790> to

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
I'll make another video in a few days to

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.060 
I'll make another video in a few days to
see<00:04:34.150> if<00:04:34.390> it<00:04:34.840> actually<00:04:35.050> does<00:04:35.350> double<00:04:35.740> my<00:04:35.830> power

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
see if it actually does double my power

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.000 
see if it actually does double my power
