00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
oh yeah this is one pound of body fat

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.570 
oh yeah this is one pound of body fat
it's<00:00:06.750> lumpy<00:00:07.080> and<00:00:07.560> it's<00:00:08.040> ugly

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
it's lumpy and it's ugly

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.589 
it's lumpy and it's ugly
this<00:00:09.300> is<00:00:09.630> muscle<00:00:10.170> it's<00:00:10.490> compact<00:00:11.490> and<00:00:11.849> it<00:00:12.420> takes

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
this is muscle it's compact and it takes

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.680 
this is muscle it's compact and it takes
up<00:00:12.780> less<00:00:12.809> space<00:00:13.580> so<00:00:14.580> why<00:00:15.030> is<00:00:15.089> it<00:00:15.269> important<00:00:15.599> to

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
up less space so why is it important to

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.150 
up less space so why is it important to
check<00:00:16.260> your<00:00:16.289> body<00:00:16.650> fat

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
check your body fat

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.490 
check your body fat
well<00:00:17.670> relying<00:00:18.090> on<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.270> scale<00:00:18.539> alone<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:19.320> measure

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
well relying on a scale alone to measure

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.349 
well relying on a scale alone to measure
your<00:00:19.710> weight<00:00:19.920> won't<00:00:20.640> give<00:00:20.880> you<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.029> complete

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
your weight won't give you a complete

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.240 
your weight won't give you a complete
picture<00:00:21.539> of<00:00:21.689> your<00:00:21.779> body<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.350> sometimes

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
picture of your body and sometimes

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.950 
picture of your body and sometimes
you'll<00:00:23.580> gain<00:00:23.789> muscle<00:00:24.210> while<00:00:24.359> losing<00:00:24.420> fat<00:00:24.930> and

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
you'll gain muscle while losing fat and

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.839 
you'll gain muscle while losing fat and
the<00:00:25.260> scale<00:00:25.560> won't<00:00:26.070> show<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.490> difference

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
the scale won't show you the difference

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.300 
the scale won't show you the difference
and<00:00:27.080> lastly<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.260> doesn't<00:00:28.830> matter<00:00:28.980> what<00:00:29.189> your

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
and lastly it doesn't matter what your

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.950 
and lastly it doesn't matter what your
weight<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:29.910> matters<00:00:30.269> how<00:00:30.420> you<00:00:30.480> look

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
during p90x I gained weight in the first

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.870 
during p90x I gained weight in the first
two<00:00:33.960> weeks<00:00:33.989> since<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:35.070> was<00:00:35.190> checking<00:00:35.430> my<00:00:35.670> body

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
two weeks since I was checking my body

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.910 
two weeks since I was checking my body
fat<00:00:36.120> each<00:00:36.270> week<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.780> was<00:00:37.170> able<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.440> see<00:00:37.680> that<00:00:37.860> I

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
fat each week I was able to see that I

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.430 
fat each week I was able to see that I
was<00:00:38.040> actually<00:00:38.489> losing<00:00:39.000> fat<00:00:39.329> even<00:00:40.230> though<00:00:40.260> the

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
was actually losing fat even though the

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.350 
was actually losing fat even though the
scale<00:00:40.680> was<00:00:40.860> going<00:00:41.190> up<00:00:41.340> because<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.059> muscle

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
scale was going up because of the muscle

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.569 
scale was going up because of the muscle
gain<00:00:42.620> now<00:00:43.620> there's<00:00:43.800> several<00:00:43.920> ways<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.370> check

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
gain now there's several ways to check

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.029 
gain now there's several ways to check
it<00:00:44.820> these<00:00:45.210> are<00:00:45.510> electrical<00:00:46.320> impedance<00:00:46.559> scales

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
it these are electrical impedance scales

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.400 
it these are electrical impedance scales
they're<00:00:47.760> horribly<00:00:48.180> inaccurate<00:00:48.480> they<00:00:49.050> always

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
they're horribly inaccurate they always

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.729 
they're horribly inaccurate they always
overestimate<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.989> I'm<00:00:51.989> sure<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.500> don't<00:00:52.620> have

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
it feels cheap it's it's plastic but it

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.340 
it feels cheap it's it's plastic but it
gets<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.799> job<00:01:28.829> done<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.579> it's<00:01:30.000> accurate<00:01:30.540> when

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
gets the job done and it's accurate when

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.800 
gets the job done and it's accurate when
you<00:01:31.470> hold<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.340> one<00:01:32.549> hand<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:32.970> pinch<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.420> skin

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
you hold it one hand and pinch a skin

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.840 
you hold it one hand and pinch a skin
fold<00:01:34.049> it'll<00:01:34.770> actually<00:01:34.920> make<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.250> little<00:01:35.460> click

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
fold it'll actually make a little click

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.760 
fold it'll actually make a little click
then<00:01:36.720> what<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:36.990> do<00:01:37.110> is<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.350> look<00:01:37.500> at<00:01:37.590> the

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
then what you do is you look at the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.160 
then what you do is you look at the
measurement<00:01:38.549> here<00:01:38.880> you'll<00:01:39.299> see<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.630> in<00:01:39.750> inches

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
measurement here you'll see it in inches

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.440 
measurement here you'll see it in inches
or<00:01:40.350> millimeters<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:41.159> then<00:01:41.970> when<00:01:42.210> you're<00:01:42.329> done

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
or millimeters and then when you're done

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.450 
or millimeters and then when you're done
you've<00:01:42.659> got<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.780> move<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.020> little<00:01:43.829> lever<00:01:44.100> back

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
you've got to move the little lever back

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.450 
you've got to move the little lever back
to<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.790> right<00:01:44.970> side<00:01:45.270> pinch<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.380> again<00:01:46.649> take

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
to the right side pinch it again take

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.080 
to the right side pinch it again take
the<00:01:47.640> reading<00:01:48.079> so<00:01:49.310> let's<00:01:50.310> get<00:01:50.490> started<00:01:50.939> we're

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
the reading so let's get started we're

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.670 
the reading so let's get started we're
going<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.270> start<00:01:51.509> with<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.750> simple<00:01:52.200> method

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
going to start with the simple method

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.429 
going to start with the simple method
and<00:01:52.920> this<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:54.000> just<00:01:54.210> checking<00:01:54.630> one<00:01:54.960> location

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
and this is just checking one location

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.109 
and this is just checking one location
on<00:01:55.680> my<00:01:55.890> body<00:01:56.100> it's<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.460> supremely<00:01:57.360> AK

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
on my body it's the supremely AK

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.440 
on my body it's the supremely AK
location<00:02:00.119> which<00:02:00.270> is<00:02:00.479> near<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.840> side<00:02:02.240> so<00:02:03.240> here

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
location which is near the side so here

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.749 
location which is near the side so here
my<00:02:03.600> wife<00:02:03.750> has<00:02:04.020> taken<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.680> diagonal<00:02:05.070> skin<00:02:05.460> fold

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
my wife has taken a diagonal skin fold

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.240 
my wife has taken a diagonal skin fold
it's<00:02:05.939> about<00:02:06.149> one<00:02:06.509> inch<00:02:06.770> one<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.860> two<00:02:07.979> inches

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
it's about one inch one to two inches

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.240 
it's about one inch one to two inches
above<00:02:08.429> my<00:02:08.940> hip<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.509> then<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.619> just<00:02:10.830> pinch<00:02:11.099> it

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
above my hip and then you just pinch it

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.150 
above my hip and then you just pinch it
with<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.610> caliper<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:12.420> then<00:02:12.959> do<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.230> reading

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
with the caliper and then do the reading

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.740 
with the caliper and then do the reading
here's<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.430> little<00:02:14.790> bit<00:02:14.910> of<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.120> closer<00:02:15.390> look

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
here's a little bit of a closer look

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.750 
here's a little bit of a closer look
you'll<00:02:16.470> want<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:16.680> make<00:02:16.800> sure<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:17.100> caliper<00:02:17.580> is

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
you'll want to make sure the caliper is

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.330 
you'll want to make sure the caliper is
halfway<00:02:18.030> between<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:19.440> edge<00:02:19.740> of<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.070> skin

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
halfway between the edge of the skin

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.750 
halfway between the edge of the skin
flap<00:02:20.580> and<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:21.420> body<00:02:21.830> so<00:02:22.830> here<00:02:23.340> we'll<00:02:23.490> move<00:02:23.610> it

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
flap and the body so here we'll move it

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.370 
flap and the body so here we'll move it
over<00:02:23.970> a<00:02:24.000> little<00:02:24.120> bit<00:02:24.330> that's<00:02:24.570> about<00:02:24.810> right

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
over a little bit that's about right

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.590 
over a little bit that's about right
and<00:02:25.770> then<00:02:26.490> you<00:02:26.580> take<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.880> measurement<00:02:27.390> in

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
and then you take the measurement in

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.110 
and then you take the measurement in
millimeters<00:02:28.380> at<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.650> bottom<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.220> then<00:02:30.030> you

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
millimeters at the bottom and then you

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.630 
millimeters at the bottom and then you
plug<00:02:30.390> it<00:02:30.540> into<00:02:30.690> this<00:02:31.020> chart<00:02:31.560> on<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:32.220> left<00:02:32.400> hand

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
plug it into this chart on the left hand

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.120 
plug it into this chart on the left hand
side<00:02:32.880> of<00:02:33.000> your<00:02:33.180> age<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:33.810> across<00:02:34.440> the<00:02:34.710> top<00:02:34.740> the

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
side of your age and across the top the

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.300 
side of your age and across the top the
millimeters<00:02:35.700> so<00:02:36.600> this<00:02:37.080> chart<00:02:37.440> comes<00:02:37.740> with<00:02:38.010> the

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
millimeters so this chart comes with the

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.950 
millimeters so this chart comes with the
fat<00:02:38.520> caliper<00:02:39.000> or<00:02:39.150> you<00:02:39.240> can<00:02:39.390> pause<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.810> video

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
fat caliper or you can pause the video

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.410 
fat caliper or you can pause the video
to<00:02:40.170> look<00:02:40.530> at<00:02:40.710> it<00:02:40.860> let's<00:02:41.730> move<00:02:41.940> on<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.210> the

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
to look at it let's move on to the

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.230 
to look at it let's move on to the
comprehensive<00:02:43.290> method<00:02:43.500> in<00:02:43.880> this<00:02:44.880> method

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
comprehensive method in this method

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.210 
comprehensive method in this method
there's<00:02:45.870> four<00:02:46.200> locations<00:02:46.530> we<00:02:46.860> look<00:02:47.010> at<00:02:47.130> the

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
there's four locations we look at the

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.120 
there's four locations we look at the
abdominal<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.970> Supriya<00:02:48.570> AK<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:49.320> arm<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:49.980> the

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
abdominal the Supriya AK the arm and the

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.300 
abdominal the Supriya AK the arm and the
thigh<00:02:51.080> the<00:02:52.080> first<00:02:52.320> location<00:02:52.860> is<00:02:53.100> the

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
thigh the first location is the

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.010 
thigh the first location is the
abdominal<00:02:53.430> it's<00:02:53.970> right<00:02:54.120> next<00:02:54.420> to<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.600> navel

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
abdominal it's right next to the navel

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.920 
abdominal it's right next to the navel
about<00:02:55.740> an<00:02:55.860> inch<00:02:56.040> over<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:56.580> again<00:02:57.360> pinch<00:02:57.750> the

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
about an inch over and again pinch the

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.310 
about an inch over and again pinch the
skin<00:02:58.170> fold<00:02:58.380> take<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.430> measurement<00:02:59.940> and<00:03:00.320> once

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
skin fold take the measurement and once

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.200 
skin fold take the measurement and once
you're<00:03:01.530> done<00:03:01.740> it's<00:03:02.190> really<00:03:02.700> important<00:03:03.150> to

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
you're done it's really important to

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.630 
you're done it's really important to
push<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:04.110> lever<00:03:04.380> back<00:03:04.800> to<00:03:05.070> the<00:03:05.190> right<00:03:05.340> side

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
push the lever back to the right side

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.630 
push the lever back to the right side
take<00:03:06.570> the<00:03:06.600> next<00:03:06.960> measurement<00:03:07.470> here<00:03:08.430> we're

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
take the next measurement here we're

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.400 
take the next measurement here we're
looking<00:03:08.910> at<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.150> soup<00:03:09.360> really<00:03:09.600> again<00:03:10.110> this<00:03:10.260> is

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
looking at the soup really again this is

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.710 
looking at the soup really again this is
the<00:03:10.590> same<00:03:10.770> location<00:03:11.340> that<00:03:11.580> we<00:03:12.270> measured

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
the same location that we measured

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.810 
the same location that we measured
during<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.380> simple<00:03:13.710> method<00:03:14.040> so<00:03:14.580> if<00:03:14.670> you've

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
during the simple method so if you've

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.250 
during the simple method so if you've
already<00:03:14.940> got<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.300> reading<00:03:15.600> from<00:03:15.750> that<00:03:15.930> spot

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
already got the reading from that spot

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.500 
already got the reading from that spot
you<00:03:16.560> can<00:03:16.710> skip<00:03:16.980> this<00:03:17.130> one

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
you can skip this one

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.860 
you can skip this one
but<00:03:18.510> again<00:03:18.930> just<00:03:19.290> taking<00:03:19.770> a<00:03:19.860> closer<00:03:20.100> look<00:03:20.250> at

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
but again just taking a closer look at

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.240 
but again just taking a closer look at
taking<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:22.140> reading<00:03:22.470> with<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:22.860> caliper<00:03:25.250> the

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
taking the reading with the caliper the

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.670 
taking the reading with the caliper the
next<00:03:26.520> location<00:03:26.910> is<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.210> arm<00:03:27.480> now<00:03:28.170> here<00:03:28.410> I<00:03:28.440> was

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
next location is the arm now here I was

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.200 
next location is the arm now here I was
initially<00:03:28.950> flexing<00:03:29.640> you<00:03:29.760> want<00:03:29.910> to<00:03:29.970> make<00:03:30.090> sure

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
initially flexing you want to make sure

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.490 
initially flexing you want to make sure
you're<00:03:30.360> not<00:03:30.480> flexing<00:03:31.050> your<00:03:31.080> arm<00:03:31.350> and<00:03:32.000> take<00:03:33.000> it

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
you're not flexing your arm and take it

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.240 
you're not flexing your arm and take it
just<00:03:34.500> behind<00:03:34.920> or<00:03:35.220> down<00:03:35.460> below<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:37.250> tricep

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
just behind or down below the the tricep

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.880 
just behind or down below the the tricep
muscle<00:03:38.750> it<00:03:39.750> gets<00:03:39.930> pretty<00:03:40.140> difficult<00:03:40.350> to<00:03:40.680> pinch

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
muscle it gets pretty difficult to pinch

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.150 
muscle it gets pretty difficult to pinch
skin<00:03:41.220> when<00:03:41.610> your<00:03:41.730> body<00:03:41.910> fat<00:03:42.120> gets<00:03:42.360> low<00:03:42.540> but<00:03:43.440> you

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
skin when your body fat gets low but you

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.930 
skin when your body fat gets low but you
should<00:03:44.820> be<00:03:44.970> able<00:03:45.030> to<00:03:45.120> get<00:03:45.240> some<00:03:45.540> if<00:03:46.080> the<00:03:46.940> last

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
should be able to get some if the last

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.270 
should be able to get some if the last
location<00:03:48.420> is<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.900> thigh<00:03:49.230> this<00:03:49.830> is<00:03:50.100> halfway

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
location is the thigh this is halfway

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.690 
location is the thigh this is halfway
between<00:03:50.459> the<00:03:50.850> knee<00:03:51.030> and<00:03:51.110> the<00:03:52.110> hip<00:03:52.400> this<00:03:53.400> again

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
between the knee and the hip this again

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.520 
between the knee and the hip this again
can<00:03:53.850> be<00:03:53.970> difficult<00:03:54.480> to<00:03:54.570> squeeze<00:03:54.959> because<00:03:55.200> the

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
can be difficult to squeeze because the

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.050 
can be difficult to squeeze because the
the<00:03:56.010> skin<00:03:56.310> gets<00:03:56.580> pretty<00:03:56.820> thick<00:03:57.080> but<00:03:58.940> you<00:03:59.940> know

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
the skin gets pretty thick but you know

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.460 
the skin gets pretty thick but you know
you<00:04:00.120> might<00:04:00.360> have<00:04:00.390> to<00:04:00.660> have<00:04:00.810> it<00:04:00.959> pinched<00:04:01.230> pretty

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
you might have to have it pinched pretty

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.980 
you might have to have it pinched pretty
tightly<00:04:02.450> once<00:04:03.450> you<00:04:03.570> have<00:04:03.690> your<00:04:03.780> four

tightly once you have your four
measurements<00:04:04.590> we're<00:04:04.770> going<00:04:04.950> to<00:04:05.040> enter<00:04:05.340> them

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490 
measurements we're going to enter them

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.310 
measurements we're going to enter them

for both so let's talk about some tips

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:54.649 
for both so let's talk about some tips
for<00:04:53.189> taking<00:04:53.490> accurate<00:04:54.030> measurements<00:04:54.509> I

00:04:54.649 --> 00:04:54.659 
for taking accurate measurements I

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:56.929 
for taking accurate measurements I
recommend<00:04:55.469> taking<00:04:55.620> them<00:04:55.919> one<00:04:56.159> time<00:04:56.430> a<00:04:56.460> week<00:04:56.699> on

00:04:56.929 --> 00:04:56.939 
recommend taking them one time a week on

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:59.330 
recommend taking them one time a week on
the<00:04:57.360> same<00:04:57.599> day<00:04:57.870> same<00:04:58.319> time<00:04:58.349> for<00:04:58.979> me<00:04:59.099> that's

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
the same day same time for me that's

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.670 
the same day same time for me that's
Saturday<00:04:59.729> mornings<00:05:00.210> but<00:05:00.840> for<00:05:01.050> you<00:05:01.139> find<00:05:01.469> when

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
that time is always take the right side

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.200 
that time is always take the right side
of<00:05:03.990> the<00:05:04.050> body<00:05:04.199> and<00:05:04.639> take<00:05:05.639> your<00:05:05.789> measurements

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
of the body and take your measurements

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.909 
of the body and take your measurements
two<00:05:06.330> or<00:05:06.479> three<00:05:06.659> times<00:05:06.810> until<00:05:07.349> you<00:05:07.740> get<00:05:07.860> a
