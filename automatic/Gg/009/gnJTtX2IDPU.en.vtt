like a cayenne pepper or cinnamon which

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.230 
like a cayenne pepper or cinnamon which
is<00:00:24.840> basically<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.439> vasodilator<00:00:26.099> draws<00:00:26.910> blood

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
is basically a vasodilator draws blood

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.890 
is basically a vasodilator draws blood
to<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.539> area<00:00:28.010> and<00:00:29.010> it's<00:00:29.220> not<00:00:29.580> quite<00:00:29.970> it's<00:00:30.810> not

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
to the area and it's not quite it's not

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.299 
to the area and it's not quite it's not
a<00:00:30.929> very<00:00:31.109> long-lasting<00:00:31.470> plump<00:00:31.949> but<00:00:32.040> it's<00:00:32.189> also

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
a very long-lasting plump but it's also

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.880 
a very long-lasting plump but it's also
can<00:00:32.550> be<00:00:32.669> really<00:00:32.790> irritating<00:00:33.140> so<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.170> recommend

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
can be really irritating so I recommend

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.750 
can be really irritating so I recommend
getting<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.760> collagen<00:00:36.750> infused<00:00:37.309> lip<00:00:38.309> product

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
getting a collagen infused lip product

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.670 
getting a collagen infused lip product
because<00:00:39.660> basically<00:00:39.989> what<00:00:40.079> happens<00:00:40.440> when<00:00:40.500> we

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
because basically what happens when we

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.350 
because basically what happens when we
apply<00:00:40.710> this<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.399> her<00:00:41.610> lips<00:00:41.820> it's<00:00:42.120> going<00:00:42.270> to

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
apply this to her lips it's going to

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.060 
apply this to her lips it's going to
warm<00:00:42.600> with<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.260> temperature<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.680> her<00:00:43.829> lips

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
warm with the temperature of her lips

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.240 
warm with the temperature of her lips
and<00:00:44.340> it's<00:00:44.489> going<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:45.260> if<00:00:46.260> she<00:00:46.770> looks<00:00:46.950> real<00:00:47.129> ups

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
and it's going to if she looks real ups

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.319 
and it's going to if she looks real ups
or<00:00:47.340> anything<00:00:47.460> like<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.700> it's<00:00:48.030> going<00:00:48.090> to

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
or anything like that it's going to

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.430 
or anything like that it's going to
expand<00:00:48.719> from<00:00:49.110> being<00:00:50.039> moist<00:00:50.510> so<00:00:51.510> I'm<00:00:52.320> gonna

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
expand from being moist so I'm gonna

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.049

this has the same technology as the

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
this has the same technology as the
pencil<00:01:41.840> with<00:01:41.960> a<00:01:42.020> dehydrator<00:01:42.619> marine<00:01:42.890> collagen

line<00:01:47.869> with<00:01:48.259> our<00:01:48.290> gloss<00:01:49.150> making<00:01:50.150> sure<00:01:50.330> that<00:01:50.509> we

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
line with our gloss making sure that we

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.840 
line with our gloss making sure that we
really<00:01:51.050> define<00:01:51.830> the<00:01:52.070> lips<00:01:52.400> with<00:01:52.550> the<00:01:52.640> gloss

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850
