00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
nice I would say it's just it looks like

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.580 
nice I would say it's just it looks like
a<00:01:09.120> you<00:01:09.540> know<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.690> mean<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:09.930> looks<00:01:10.170> like<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.470> could

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
a you know I mean it looks like it could

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.070 
a you know I mean it looks like it could
do<00:01:10.740> damage<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.610> also<00:01:11.790> can<00:01:12.120> be<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.870> good

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
do damage and it also can be a good

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.370 
do damage and it also can be a good
survival<00:01:13.470> tool<00:01:14.210> it's<00:01:15.210> got<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.480> paracord<00:01:16.080> grip

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
survival tool it's got the paracord grip

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.170 
survival tool it's got the paracord grip
I'm<00:01:17.160> not<00:01:17.640> sure<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.870> length<00:01:19.550> but<00:01:20.550> I<00:01:20.610> would<00:01:20.880> say

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
I'm not sure the length but I would say

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.400 
I'm not sure the length but I would say
maybe<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:22.020> mean<00:01:22.710> this<00:01:22.860> this<00:01:23.160> is<00:01:23.220> like<00:01:24.110> 40<00:01:25.110> feet

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:25.410 
maybe I mean this this is like 40 feet

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.110 
maybe I mean this this is like 40 feet
maybe<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:25.830> don't<00:01:26.220> know<00:01:26.460> I'm<00:01:26.580> just<00:01:26.610> kind<00:01:26.970> of

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
maybe I don't know I'm just kind of

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.530 
maybe I don't know I'm just kind of
guessing<00:01:27.360> maybe<00:01:27.930> 30<00:01:28.350> feet<00:01:29.120> it's<00:01:30.120> more<00:01:30.390> than

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
guessing maybe 30 feet it's more than

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.360 
guessing maybe 30 feet it's more than
the<00:01:30.600> average<00:01:30.840> paracord<00:01:31.470> knife<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.800> I<00:01:32.010> know<00:01:32.070> that
