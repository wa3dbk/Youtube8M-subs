00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.290
 Hello and a warm welcome 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.290
 preview video for assassin's creed 3 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.560
 yes and here we are more typical 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.600
 assassin's creed magic at once 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.609
 an important historical event 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.609
 actively involved in how he helps 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.890
 namely at the boston tea party dmt 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.110
 to throw overboard and equal 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.160
 nor the advancing British redcoats 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.710
 ward 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.570
 this boston tea party was the 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:54.120
 starting shot for the American 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:57.210
 Revolution at all, what would assassin's be 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.719
 creed 3 without fighting it will be a lot again 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.590
 money slaughters and shot and sometimes 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.019
 freezes 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.040
 but this is happening now 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.310
 liquid by he tends to 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.310
 to do to opponents 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.140
 like yourself, you see the new hero too 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.450
 like to be tomahawk 1 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.520
 that's such a small hint 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.190
 that he is half indian 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:37.380
 besides, such a tomahawk is one 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:39.659
 damn dangerous instrument and 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.390
 of course, it draws on in the corner 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.850
 the roofs in this case of boston and 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.670
 Of course they are a bit more modern 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.160
 when it is still in istanbul or at the time 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.789
 the renaissance in venice or rome of the 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.310
 case was 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:56.610
 Now we'll choose one here 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.850
 bow out as a new weapon and what makes 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.009
 man with a bow no not people 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.340
 know that too are assassin's 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.110
 creed but you hunt with a bow and 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.410
 a look that sweet little banks again 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.940
 in front and dear children 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.890
 if he has this video so far 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.940
 have seen why that is actually 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.340
 not approved by 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.920
 now looks away because, now please 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.610
 his sheet no no i can i can 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.829
 not see that for yourself 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.680
 Here we are in another forest 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:31.260
 in the night and you can live again 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.110
 how wonderful that jumping around in too 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.239
 free nature works i think that's it 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.360
 I do not have to say very sexy 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.489
 on roofs or wall projections to be 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.090
 act but just here for it 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:48.019
 By the way, provided bumps it works 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.130
 do on every tree 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:53.280
 but here again the final 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.560
 rescue shot against bambis can their 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:03.360
 maybe revised 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:05.849
 but the nature beats back resp 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.810
 she travels back then if you 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:12.269
 really record it here though 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:16.769
 quickie world mesh from the wolf 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:20.730
 but a fur and there it does 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:23.280
 same again in new assassin's creed 3 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.470
 is that you have your own settlement 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.860
 and this settlement will be in this case 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.080
 visited by a thief and he does 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.080
 when a killer comes around the corner he comes 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.030
 run away and this mission or this 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.700
 mission strip of course the cellar now 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.600
 already from many series parts but 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.450
 be honest 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.660
 this affects me through nature 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.670
 you run here very differently than exactly 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:52.310
 the same types of mission still in 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.310
 Assassin's creed revelations 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:05.070
 and guess what, we have their end 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:07.680
 have not gone such a mission step the 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:10.920
 we are a little mayor and so on 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.470
 to own settlements experience here 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.200
 In dispute the children call us 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.079
 to help to separate their fathers and 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.100
 We are serious about this 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:47.650
 weird scene 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:49.360
 Finally, I cool off a bit 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.900
 personally have low houseboat 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:56.530
 control experience but I'll tell times 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.380
 so the German coastal guard would have 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:02.050
 probably their fun at the 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:04.350
 agile nimble and fast friends and 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.540
 especially in a lame setting 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:11.110
 ignoring the reality of turning 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:13.840
 ships we have it here with one 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:16.450
 doing action game and that works 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.480
 a little on speed but if you go then 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:22.150
 to see such a beautiful view as here 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:25.540
 passing this on a coastal 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:28.270
 then it compensates for the fortress 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:31.860
 They are about 10 times fast 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.860
 maneuver and could or 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.640
 particularly impressive are the 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:49.080
 Sea battles, of course, in bad 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:49.080
 weather watch out for the mountains 

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:08.139
 Assassin's creed 3 has in ours 

00:06:05.709 --> 00:06:08.770
 preview a good impression 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:11.919
 made 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:14.750
 we still doubt some points 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:17.690
 is then read exactly in the big 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:20.680
 Tested report but still we are 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:25.930
 very good hope that in the end but a 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:25.930
 Great game came out of it
