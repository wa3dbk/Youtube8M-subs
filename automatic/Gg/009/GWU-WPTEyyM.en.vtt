and it also to use and fibrous land
topsoil<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.719> makes<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.079> easier<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.410> screed

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
topsoil it makes it easier to screed

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.819 
topsoil it makes it easier to screed
because<00:00:44.520> it's<00:00:44.969> clean<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.450> it's<00:00:45.600> got<00:00:46.440> no<00:00:46.590> roots

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
because it's clean and it's got no roots

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.459 
because it's clean and it's got no roots
and<00:00:47.039> stuff<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:49.280> it<00:00:50.280> took<00:00:50.430> us<00:00:50.610> about<00:00:51.469> two

us three days to lay but if you're doing

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.240 
us three days to lay but if you're doing
it<00:01:44.539> yourself<00:01:44.599> it<00:01:45.469> could<00:01:45.679> take<00:01:45.890> up<00:01:46.069> to<00:01:46.099> about
