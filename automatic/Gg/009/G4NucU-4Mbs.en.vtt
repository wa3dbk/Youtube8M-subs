00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:15.470
 if we went far with a horizon 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:19.300
 and so they remained an added they were made 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.300
 well every soul nights 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.220
 a disagreement 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:14.860
 the real author besides the author of the 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.860
 topic got very excited with this matrix 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:27.580
 the people are a little bit with us 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.580
 here because this topic 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:38.959
 besides being wonderful in his 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:40.850
 proposal with a poet so everyday and 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.700
 while still having all that poetry 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.400
 when he writes we are good because I 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.590
 I met him I knew when he entered the 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.820
 Spider woman with Alberto and Alberto 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.820
 shortcut to the dressing room and I almost fainted 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.890
 because of course in the end it's life 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.970
 since my adolescence and when I had it 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.970
 there forward and I stayed 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.989
 he was telling me that they did the 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:13.510
 luna park that the people wow but every 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.250
 Once we can we always do it and 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.189
 in addition with the boys of the choir kennedy 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:21.129
 that always accompany us 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:22.959
 I think it 's a divine tribute to the 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.609
 Santa Cecilia music that I found out 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.670
 advertise because it was the day of the 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:30.519
 music by with the decapitated in the year 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:39.180
 2100 was not sung at the bonfire 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:39.180
 poor if I did not know how to take out is not true 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:50.030
 to tell a story about the story 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:04:01.280
 I'm not surprised by the streets 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.189
 people told me happiness there is much more 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.840
 people are aware of santa cecilia that 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:07.280
 is the patron of music and we 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.780
 congratulated for our money what 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.739
 passes the control or for a detention that 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.720
 there's rap 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:14.540
 you saw the information is all the time 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.590

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.590
