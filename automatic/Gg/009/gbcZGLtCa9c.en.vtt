00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 yes, as apple then apple maps 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.480
 they also introduced the 3d 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.690
 function so the fly over function of 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.000
 shown conscience cities that there 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.700
 already in many cities there can 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.130
 her in the 3d view so go through 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.160
 switch everything in 3d look at it now 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.449
 really wonderful and now in 18 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.910
 Apple introduced guided tours 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:29.160
 means for such a kind of sightseeing 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.949
 the cities through and the most important ones 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.239
 places are shown the whole thing goes on 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.309
 the iphone as well as on the ipad 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.840
 but I thought on the iphone 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.250
 that's why I'm showing that 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.910
 you on the ipad 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.910
 have fun 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.660
 as they are now here on the ipad in 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.700
 the maps app and we see we have 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.290
 here germany and what they as 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.980
 The first thing you have to do is the view 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:58.010
 to switch from standard to hybrid and 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.540
 then you see the view invites you here 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.280
 and unfortunately it does not work yet 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.920
 in all cities that you fly as well 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.979
 You can do over tours only at 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.180
 the cities that are yellow so you see 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.910
 here certain cities, for example, cologne 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.140
 is yellow had yellow point there can 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.619
 for example, such a bike tour 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.440
 do 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.729
 Let's take a look here in me 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.330
 try to pronounce yourself so only 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.680
 two cities in france go paris 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.410
 barcelona goes the rome 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.759
 so many cities are already there 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.910
 mainly when we always have the globe 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:33.149
 turn and load the whole thing in the 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:35.880
 USA, of course, on New York over here 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:36.960
 a bit francisco and the whole 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.700
 problem now just in san 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.220
 francisco out because I think san 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.780
 francisco is very secretive 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.670
 we see san francisco clicking on that 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.430
 yellow on it so if we are here on san 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.440
 francisco on it we see that 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.569
 whole is a fly over city like you 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.229
 See and over there you can tour 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:53.610
 click 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.259
 and if we click on tour now 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.300
 look for the whole thing very slowly in san 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.099
 francisco rhine shows through the whole 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.470
 Attractions turns a bit 

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:02.970
 around and that is really very cool 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.170
 if you ever wanted to drive a city 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.940
 who does not know the 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.490
 want to know sights like that 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.709
 look where they are just before he goes there 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.720
 ride really cool if that time 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.540
 in all cities is currently only 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.590
 in a handful of pages 202 hands before 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.580
 so I think that's currently ten 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.930
 cities where that works and yes me 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.890
 start the tour now in san 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.010
 francisco here 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.330
 let it all go and wind it on 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.730
 end just before then the tour lasts 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.069
 somehow just about five to ten 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.660
 minutes I think so is very 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.420
 very long because of that but will fast forward 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:40.950
 So yes I start here on tour and how 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:43.910
 you see we have the option below then 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.910
 to finish the tour again 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.680
 we have the option below the tour 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.530
 to finish and now we just see 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:55.769
 It is slowly becoming the first 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.769
 Wanted the zoo 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:05.230
 We also see where how wonderful the 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:06.940
 Quality is the picture improves 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.890
 also depending on how good your internet is 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:13.379
 everything is reloaded 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:15.489
 we look at it wonderful 3d in 3d 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:18.330
 and so it goes along 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.330
 various sights 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.860
 That was a small tour of San 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.990
 francisco I have it all now 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.060
 Just have a look 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:39.000
 other city to the a bit 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.800
 sometimes german go up again 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.700
 hybrid that we see which cities 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.370
 get supported 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.300
 and then we'll just show you one 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.210
 city ​​in germany 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.940
 because the only city ​​in the in 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:52.890
 Germany works is Cologne 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:56.810
 So let's take a look overfly over here 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:59.970
 City of Cologne was the tour of Cologne and 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.710
 Then we fly to Cologne and see 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.250
 Here are the sights of 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.250
 Cologne 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.820
 I think that's enough as 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:32.930
 small insight into the fly over tours 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.590
 in ios 818 you can do that once 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.729
 try out 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.639
 now you know how the whole 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.630
 works for all others from autumn 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:40.850
 could try that 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.530
 You know how it works 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.880
 think very cool I have first 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.720
 thought that then always so small films 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.300
 this expire 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.419
 but it is not like that because you can 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:53.030
 somewhere zoom in and the tour 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:54.740
 continue where I last stopped 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.350
 so if not narrower then 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.300
 want to look but here the dom 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:02.000
 then you turn the dimmer on the domen 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:08.690
 the beautiful is and you returned 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:11.330
 immediately back to the tour yes as I said that 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.860
 whole is wonderful if you somehow 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.500
 you do not want to travel yet 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.160
 and I have seen and there you can 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.110
 then you just those times 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.960
 let sights show that 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.010
 you can see where they are and so on 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.210
 i think it's a pity that it's not in yet 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.770
 so many cities work or 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.900
 employees in Germany already 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.330
 a bit meager a city 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:32.169
 but well, there is still a beta that can 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.169
 Of course everything still after 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:38.360
 and yes I just see here that 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:41.510
 a city in spain so are already 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:46.840
 some cities take their time 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:49.970
 it could also look something 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:52.330
 stockholm we have so really 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:55.190
 very interesting just somewhere 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:58.099
 to look through where in good yellow cities 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:00.169
 are where you can look at nature 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:01.810
 and a little bit through the 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:04.430
 city ​​can show 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:06.979
 yes that was it with the video 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.900
 as I said the whole goes on ipod touch 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:10.639
 iphone and ipad I wanted you now 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.800
 Just show me on the ipad 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:14.240
 firstly, nothing at 18 actually 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.849
 on the ipad and secondly 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.979
 because the display is bigger than me 

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:20.810
 now a bit more even if it is 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:24.560
 eventually and it creates sorry 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:27.289
 but it is so I think it's one 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.419
 very very cool function even if apple 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:30.500
 has come announced 

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:32.110
 probably in the fall yet for it 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.520
 was somehow a hidden function 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.120
 because none of them knew about it 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.430
 anyone 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.590
 has and down, as we said you can do it 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.449
 Try the others in the fall and 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.590
 then it was with the video yes if you 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:45.060
 I liked the video 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:47.220
 happy about a thumbs up 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:50.460
 as I said below could comment and 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:51.660
 subscribe for another 18 videos and 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.350
 then we'll see each other in the next video 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.350
 again until then
