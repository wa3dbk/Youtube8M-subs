these<00:00:13.950> are<00:00:14.130> mung<00:00:14.430> beans<00:00:15.139> mung<00:00:16.139> beans<00:00:16.379> grow<00:00:16.650> in

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
these are mung beans mung beans grow in

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.350 
these are mung beans mung beans grow in
China<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:18.050> -<00:00:19.400> they<00:00:20.400> harvest<00:00:20.849> them<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.270> then

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:21.360 
China and - they harvest them and then

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.300 
China and - they harvest them and then
the<00:00:21.540> workers<00:00:21.750> lay<00:00:22.110> them<00:00:22.320> on<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.470> roads<00:00:22.920> so

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
the workers lay them on the roads so

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.280 
the workers lay them on the roads so
they're<00:00:23.550> quite<00:00:23.820> dusty<00:00:24.150> when<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:24.810> get<00:00:25.020> them

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:25.290 
they're quite dusty when you get them

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.479 
they're quite dusty when you get them
and<00:00:25.500> so<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.310> need<00:00:26.610> to<00:00:26.640> rinse<00:00:26.970> them<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.300> lot<00:00:28.489> but

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:29.489 
and so you need to rinse them a lot but

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:31.310 
and so you need to rinse them a lot but
it's<00:00:29.640> got<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.939> magic<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.450> China<00:00:30.720> in<00:00:30.930> the<00:00:31.050> dust

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
it's got the magic of China in the dust

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.040 
it's got the magic of China in the dust
and<00:00:32.070> dust<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.730> good<00:00:32.940> for<00:00:33.180> you<00:00:33.300> right<00:00:33.540> tamal<00:00:33.870> of

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
and dust is good for you right tamal of

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.799 
and dust is good for you right tamal of
minerals<00:00:34.440> so<00:00:35.370> anyway<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:36.090> take<00:00:36.329> these<00:00:36.510> mung

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
minerals so anyway you take these mung

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.450 
minerals so anyway you take these mung
beans<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.670> soak<00:00:38.670> them<00:00:39.000> for<00:00:39.450> 12<00:00:40.380> hours<00:00:40.859> after

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
beans and soak them for 12 hours after

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.330

soaked<00:00:44.550> them<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.719> like<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.050> soak<00:00:46.289> them<00:00:46.469> in

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
soaked them and I like to soak them in

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.270 
soaked them and I like to soak them in
my<00:00:47.129> sprout<00:00:47.489> bag<00:00:48.260> because<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.710> then<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:49.949> made<00:00:50.250> a

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
my sprout bag because and then I made a

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.930 
my sprout bag because and then I made a
whole<00:00:50.550> bag<00:00:50.760> right<00:00:51.120> here<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:52.440> my<00:00:52.649> draining<00:00:53.160> the

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
whole bag right here and my draining the

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.079 
whole bag right here and my draining the
draining<00:00:54.359> thingy<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:55.530> then<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.489> can<00:00:56.670> just<00:00:56.820> wash

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:57.089 
draining thingy and then I can just wash

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:58.970 
draining thingy and then I can just wash
it<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.390> let<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.749> drip<00:00:57.989> right<00:00:58.199> in<00:00:58.379> my<00:00:58.530> draining

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
it and let it drip right in my draining

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.020 
it and let it drip right in my draining
rack<00:00:59.449> so<00:01:00.449> then<00:01:00.659> during<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.109> day<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.800> let<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.850> sit

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
rack so then during the day I let it sit

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.990 
rack so then during the day I let it sit
in<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.269> Sun<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.839> between<00:01:04.500> rinses<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.580> put<00:01:05.820> on<00:01:05.970> a

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
in the Sun and between rinses I put on a

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.480 
in the Sun and between rinses I put on a
weight<00:01:06.390> because<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.590> helps<00:01:07.980> keep<00:01:08.220> the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
weight because that helps keep the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.450 
weight because that helps keep the
sprouts<00:01:08.850> in<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.420> matte<00:01:09.830> you<00:01:10.830> can<00:01:11.040> do<00:01:11.250> without

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
sprouts in a matte you can do without

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.660 
sprouts in a matte you can do without
the<00:01:11.820> way<00:01:11.940> you<00:01:12.000> can<00:01:12.390> keep<00:01:12.540> them<00:01:12.689> all<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:13.229> but<00:01:13.670> to

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
the way you can keep them all is but to

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.270 
the way you can keep them all is but to
do<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.970> typical<00:01:15.180> mung<00:01:15.630> bean<00:01:15.899> match<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:17.130> want

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
do the typical mung bean match you want

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.770 
do the typical mung bean match you want
to<00:01:17.369> keep<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.549> weight<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:17.970> then<00:01:18.090> reduce<00:01:18.479> the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
to keep a weight and then reduce the

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.389 
to keep a weight and then reduce the
weight<00:01:18.960> every<00:01:19.290> day<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:19.829> if<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:19.979> just<00:01:20.159> take<00:01:20.340> a

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:20.399 
weight every day so if you just take a

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:23.120 
weight every day so if you just take a
thing<00:01:20.700> water<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.509> then<00:01:22.020> pour<00:01:22.350> some<00:01:22.380> out<00:01:22.770> every

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
thing water and then pour some out every

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.090 
thing water and then pour some out every
day<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.670> then<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.930> next<00:01:25.290> day<00:01:25.320> weight<00:01:25.950> it

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
day and then the next day weight it

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.160 
day and then the next day weight it
again<00:01:26.430> pour<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.390> in<00:01:27.479> years<00:01:27.719> instead<00:01:28.079> of

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
again pour it in years instead of

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.730 
again pour it in years instead of
wasting<00:01:28.290> water<00:01:29.090> every<00:01:30.090> day<00:01:30.119> waited<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.049> if

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
wasting water every day waited and if

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.380 
wasting water every day waited and if
you<00:01:31.860> want<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.369> can<00:01:32.549> eat<00:01:32.670> them<00:01:32.850> anytime<00:01:33.090> you

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
you want you can eat them anytime you

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.350 
you want you can eat them anytime you
want<00:01:33.600> if<00:01:34.469> you<00:01:34.770> wait<00:01:35.280> just<00:01:35.310> one<00:01:35.850> day<00:01:36.119> they'll

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
want if you wait just one day they'll

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.910 
want if you wait just one day they'll
just<00:01:36.540> be<00:01:36.719> a<00:01:36.750> little<00:01:37.079> bit<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.380> course<00:01:37.619> in<00:01:37.829> the

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
just be a little bit of course in the

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.050 
just be a little bit of course in the
next<00:01:38.070> day<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.369> couple<00:01:38.640> inches<00:01:38.969> so<00:01:39.750> these<00:01:40.079> are

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
next day a couple inches so these are

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.870 
next day a couple inches so these are
three<00:01:42.060> days<00:01:42.240> sprouts<00:01:42.979> and<00:01:43.979> they<00:01:44.520> look<00:01:44.700> like

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
three days sprouts and they look like

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.670 
three days sprouts and they look like
this<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.450> while<00:01:45.990> you're<00:01:46.200> rinsing<00:01:46.380> them

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
this and you while you're rinsing them

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.709 
this and you while you're rinsing them
you<00:01:46.799> don't<00:01:47.100> want<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.579> rinse<00:01:47.789> them<00:01:48.000> around<00:01:48.539> and

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719 
you don't want to rinse them around and

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:49.819 
you don't want to rinse them around and
around<00:01:48.780> with<00:01:49.049> your<00:01:49.170> hand<00:01:49.380> because<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.710> will

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
around with your hand because it will

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.490 
around with your hand because it will
loosen<00:01:50.039> them<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.520> want<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.820> keep<00:01:50.969> the<00:01:51.180> match

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
loosen them you want to keep the match

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.770 
loosen them you want to keep the match
so<00:01:52.500> wash<00:01:53.250> them<00:01:53.640> just<00:01:54.000> right<00:01:54.270> in<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.509> bag<00:01:56.780> and

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
so wash them just right in the bag and

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.830 
so wash them just right in the bag and
then<00:01:57.960> let<00:01:58.170> them<00:01:58.350> drain<00:01:58.680> in<00:01:58.979> something<00:01:59.490> and

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
then let them drain in something and

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.149 
then let them drain in something and
we're<00:02:00.840> going<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.020> make<00:02:01.170> two<00:02:01.350> recipes<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:02.039> them

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
we're going to make two recipes of them

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.039 
we're going to make two recipes of them
today<00:02:02.340> actually<00:02:02.789> these<00:02:02.969> mung<00:02:03.329> beans<00:02:03.659> have

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
today actually these mung beans have

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.999 
today actually these mung beans have
vitamins<00:02:04.740> A<00:02:04.859> E<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.759> K<00:02:06.090> B<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:07.140> b6

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
vitamins A E and K B and b6
