come up here today to have a look at the
spring<00:00:19.800> well<00:00:20.070> I<00:00:22.250> just<00:00:23.250> wanted<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.910> check<00:00:24.210> that

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:25.099 
spring well I just wanted to check that

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:35.420 
spring well I just wanted to check that
everything<00:00:26.099> was<00:00:26.279> ok<00:00:31.250> here<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:34.370> now<00:00:35.370> the

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
everything was ok here it is now the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.889 
everything was ok here it is now the
well<00:00:35.670> itself<00:00:37.280> is<00:00:38.280> quite<00:00:38.579> an<00:00:38.730> ancient<00:00:40.340> spring

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
well itself is quite an ancient spring

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:45.670 
well itself is quite an ancient spring
I'm<00:00:42.899> just<00:00:43.469> going<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.829> go<00:00:43.980> close<00:00:44.340> on<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.850> the

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
I'm just going to go close on to the

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.590 
I'm just going to go close on to the
vegetation<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.860> water<00:00:47.129> there<00:00:47.600> because

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
vegetation and the water there because

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.920 
vegetation and the water there because
there<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:48.930> can<00:00:48.960> see<00:00:49.350> water<00:00:49.680> mint<00:00:50.690> that's<00:00:51.690> the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
there you can see water mint that's the

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.520 
there you can see water mint that's the
green<00:00:52.170> leafy<00:00:53.120> material<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.809> then<00:00:54.989> just<00:00:55.230> below

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
green leafy material and then just below

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.700 
green leafy material and then just below
it<00:00:55.559> with<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.309> spring<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.730> bubbling<00:00:57.469> you<00:00:58.469> can

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
it with the spring is bubbling you can

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.410 
it with the spring is bubbling you can
see<00:00:58.949> something<00:00:59.879> called<00:01:00.120> spongy<00:01:00.690> Tom<00:01:01.609> SP<00:01:02.609> oMG

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
see something called spongy Tom SP oMG

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.370 
see something called spongy Tom SP oMG
eto<00:01:04.199> n<00:01:04.880> now<00:01:05.880> sponge<00:01:06.270> Thanh<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.869> really<00:01:07.200> good

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
eto n now sponge Thanh is a really good

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.570 
eto n now sponge Thanh is a really good
indicator<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.280> water<00:01:08.640> quality<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:10.460> where<00:01:11.460> you

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
indicator of water quality and where you

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.390 
indicator of water quality and where you
have<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:12.000> in<00:01:12.119> abundance<00:01:12.890> you<00:01:13.890> can<00:01:14.130> rest

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
have it in abundance you can rest

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.770 
have it in abundance you can rest
assured<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.150> water<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.780> clean<00:01:17.600> this<00:01:18.600> is

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
assured that the water is clean this is

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.039 
assured that the water is clean this is
what<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.170> ancient<00:01:19.560> people<00:01:19.890> would<00:01:20.070> have<00:01:20.189> used

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
what the ancient people would have used

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.710 
what the ancient people would have used
as<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.110> measuring<00:01:22.650> stick<00:01:22.770> for<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.310> water

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
as a measuring stick for the water

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.570 
as a measuring stick for the water
rather<00:01:24.720> than<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.140> scientific<00:01:25.830> analysis<00:01:26.430> that

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
rather than the scientific analysis that

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.969 
rather than the scientific analysis that
we<00:01:26.700> use<00:01:26.970> today

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.789 

in<00:01:32.979> the<00:01:33.189> world<00:01:33.929> it's<00:01:34.929> a<00:01:35.049> great<00:01:35.079> big<00:01:35.469> concrete

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
in the world it's a great big concrete

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.590 
in the world it's a great big concrete
pipe<00:01:36.369> and<00:01:37.890> then<00:01:38.890> the<00:01:39.039> pipe<00:01:39.280> there<00:01:40.030> is<00:01:40.060> a<00:01:40.179> small

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
pipe and then the pipe there is a small

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.389 
pipe and then the pipe there is a small
inlet<00:01:41.140> channel<00:01:41.619> I'll<00:01:41.740> just<00:01:41.979> see<00:01:42.159> if<00:01:42.250> I<00:01:42.369> can

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
inlet channel I'll just see if I can

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.639 
inlet channel I'll just see if I can
pile<00:01:43.270> it<00:01:43.450> down<00:01:43.659> here<00:01:43.929> so<00:01:44.109> you<00:01:44.200> can<00:01:44.319> have<00:01:44.619> a

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
pile it down here so you can have a

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:47.779 
pile it down here so you can have a
closer<00:01:44.979> look<00:01:45.329> it's<00:01:46.329> a<00:01:46.390> very<00:01:46.600> simple<00:01:46.899> system

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
closer look it's a very simple system

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:52.620 
closer look it's a very simple system
just<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:50.229> water<00:01:50.880> from<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:52.000> actual<00:01:52.390> well

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
just the water from the actual well

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.990 
just the water from the actual well
filters<00:01:53.289> down<00:01:53.500> into<00:01:53.890> the<00:01:54.009> big<00:01:54.240> land<00:01:55.240> pipe<00:01:57.000> deep

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
filters down into the big land pipe deep

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.730 
filters down into the big land pipe deep
within<00:01:58.270> the<00:01:58.569> pipe<00:01:59.459> there<00:02:00.459> is<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:02.380> you<00:02:02.500> can't

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
within the pipe there is and you can't

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.949 
within the pipe there is and you can't
see<00:02:03.009> it<00:02:03.130> but<00:02:03.549> there<00:02:03.789> is<00:02:03.909> a<00:02:03.939> water<00:02:04.299> pipe<00:02:04.659> then

00:02:04.949 --> 00:02:04.959 
see it but there is a water pipe then

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:08.069 
see it but there is a water pipe then
that<00:02:05.170> leads<00:02:05.380> out<00:02:05.649> from<00:02:05.920> that<00:02:05.950> and<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:07.869> just

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:08.079 
that leads out from that and it just

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:10.949 
that leads out from that and it just
flows<00:02:08.470> down<00:02:09.069> you<00:02:09.880> can<00:02:10.090> see<00:02:10.269> this<00:02:10.450> is<00:02:10.630> a<00:02:10.660> whole

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
flows down you can see this is a whole

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.630 
flows down you can see this is a whole
lot<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:12.310> flows<00:02:12.670> down<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:13.360> a<00:02:13.450> gravity<00:02:13.930> feed

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
lot it flows down and a gravity feed

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.280 
lot it flows down and a gravity feed
right<00:02:15.640> down<00:02:16.000> there<00:02:16.269> into<00:02:16.540> one<00:02:16.660> point<00:02:17.019> in<00:02:17.200> the

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
right down there into one point in the

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.520 
right down there into one point in the
camera<00:02:17.709> with<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:17.950> cartridges<00:02:19.200> so<00:02:20.200> there's<00:02:20.410> no

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
camera with the cartridges so there's no

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.039 
camera with the cartridges so there's no
pumps<00:02:21.099> no<00:02:22.049> electricity<00:02:23.049> needed<00:02:24.750> I'm<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.930> only

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.289 
alone as much as I can because where you
have<00:02:45.489> water<00:02:47.609> there<00:02:48.609> is<00:02:48.730> like<00:02:48.970> a<00:02:49.000> very<00:02:49.720> sacred

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
have water there is like a very sacred

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.259 
have water there is like a very sacred
ecosystem<00:02:52.299> at<00:02:52.510> work<00:02:52.840> there<00:02:53.170> and<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:54.700> less<00:02:55.000> you
