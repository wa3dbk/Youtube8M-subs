00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.370 
pretty good he was me and him pretty
much<00:01:52.470> split<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.979> kills<00:01:53.899> and<00:01:54.899> if<00:01:55.049> he<00:01:55.110> wasn't<00:01:55.320> in

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
much split the kills and if he wasn't in

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.899 
much split the kills and if he wasn't in
the<00:01:55.439> game<00:01:55.560> he's<00:01:55.799> probably<00:01:55.950> have<00:01:56.189> been<00:01:56.280> easily

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
the game he's probably have been easily

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.830 
the game he's probably have been easily
been<00:01:57.210> like<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.360> 40<00:01:57.719> kill<00:01:57.869> game<00:01:58.130> it<00:01:59.130> was<00:01:59.280> really

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
been like a 40 kill game it was really

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.740 
been like a 40 kill game it was really
you<00:02:00.840> see<00:02:01.020> at<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.290> end<00:02:02.450> like<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.600> could<00:02:03.719> have

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
you see at the end like it could have

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.339 
you see at the end like it could have
been<00:02:03.930> but<00:02:04.229> he<00:02:05.189> got<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.399> bunch<00:02:05.579> of<00:02:05.670> kills<00:02:05.850> to

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
over in the back corner so good place to

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:51.119 
over in the back corner so good place to
go<00:02:43.879> on<00:02:44.000> my<00:02:44.150> shop<00:02:44.750> around<00:02:44.989> her<00:02:46.060> and<00:02:49.660> call<00:02:50.660> it<00:02:50.840> in

go on my shop around her and call it in

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.580 
go on my shop around her and call it in
and<00:02:52.269> I<00:02:53.269> see<00:02:53.450> that<00:02:53.720> most<00:02:54.110> of<00:02:54.200> the<00:02:54.290> time<00:02:54.470> they're

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
and I see that most of the time they're

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.130 
and I see that most of the time they're
hiding<00:02:54.950> in<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:55.129> trailers<00:02:55.579> then<00:02:56.329> didn't<00:02:56.989> Roger

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
hiding in the trailers then didn't Roger

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.690 
hiding in the trailers then didn't Roger
try<00:02:57.650> to<00:02:57.709> shoot<00:02:57.890> down<00:02:58.040> or<00:02:58.310> they<00:02:58.400> might<00:02:58.549> have

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
try to shoot down or they might have

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.539 
try to shoot down or they might have
shot<00:02:58.970> like<00:02:59.120> one<00:02:59.299> stinger<00:02:59.540> at<00:02:59.690> it<00:02:59.810> but<00:03:00.019> I<00:03:00.549> don't

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
shot like one stinger at it but I don't

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:02.470 
shot like one stinger at it but I don't
think<00:03:01.609> they<00:03:01.730> were<00:03:01.790> successful<00:03:02.359> in<00:03:02.390> treating

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
think they were successful in treating

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.720 
think they were successful in treating
down<00:03:02.810> for<00:03:02.989> a<00:03:03.019> while<00:03:03.370> well<00:03:04.370> I<00:03:04.400> still<00:03:04.609> wasn't

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
down for a while well I still wasn't

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.190 
down for a while well I still wasn't
able<00:03:04.819> to<00:03:05.030> get<00:03:05.150> too<00:03:05.299> many<00:03:05.420> kills<00:03:05.660> because<00:03:05.900> they

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
able to get too many kills because they

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.449 
able to get too many kills because they
were<00:03:06.260> hiding<00:03:06.560> in<00:03:06.590> those<00:03:06.709> two<00:03:06.890> back<00:03:07.040> trailers

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
were hiding in those two back trailers

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.160 
were hiding in those two back trailers
over<00:03:07.640> there<00:03:09.670> uh<00:03:10.670> which<00:03:11.090> I<00:03:11.540> don't<00:03:11.840> know<00:03:11.959> if<00:03:12.019> the

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
over there uh which I don't know if the

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.569 
over there uh which I don't know if the
ac-130<00:03:12.620> would<00:03:12.859> have<00:03:12.950> been<00:03:13.069> better<00:03:13.220> if<00:03:13.340> I<00:03:13.519> could

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
ac-130 would have been better if I could

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:15.640 
ac-130 would have been better if I could
have<00:03:13.819> got<00:03:14.420> a<00:03:14.450> little<00:03:14.599> blast<00:03:14.870> radius<00:03:15.139> in<00:03:15.440> there

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
have got a little blast radius in there

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.580 
have got a little blast radius in there
and<00:03:15.829> played<00:03:16.609> some<00:03:16.700> of<00:03:16.910> them<00:03:17.030> out<00:03:17.150> I<00:03:17.560> was<00:03:18.560> I

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.069 
and played some of them out I was I
believe<00:03:18.650> like<00:03:18.920> five<00:03:19.280> six<00:03:19.819> seven<00:03:20.510> kills<00:03:20.870> may<00:03:21.019> be

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
believe like five six seven kills may be

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:25.120

this area over here is usually one of

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.250 
this area over here is usually one of
the<00:04:32.120> major<00:04:32.360> choke<00:04:32.690> points<00:04:33.020> if<00:04:33.140> they're

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
the major choke points if they're

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.680 
the major choke points if they're
spawning<00:04:33.500> people<00:04:34.400> spot<00:04:35.060> on<00:04:35.180> both<00:04:35.270> sides<00:04:35.510> of<00:04:35.570> it

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:45.060 
and what about a 12 for the close
quarters<00:04:40.130> on<00:04:40.400> the<00:04:40.430> trailers<00:04:41.770> and<00:04:42.770> I<00:04:42.830> think

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
quarters on the trailers and I think

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.760

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.650 
here I was just trying to get a couple
more<00:04:48.830> kills<00:04:49.070> get<00:04:49.250> my<00:04:49.340> kilt<00:04:49.580> to<00:04:49.970> get<00:04:50.120> my<00:04:50.480> kill

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
more kills get my kilt to get my kill

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.140 
more kills get my kilt to get my kill
streak<00:04:50.900> for<00:04:51.200> the<00:04:51.230> end<00:04:52.010> of<00:04:52.280> the<00:04:52.340> game<00:04:52.370> and<00:04:52.760> I

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
streak for the end of the game and I

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.550 
streak for the end of the game and I
should've<00:04:53.360> called<00:04:53.450> my<00:04:53.660> premise<00:04:54.020> a<00:04:54.110> little<00:04:54.350> a

should've called my premise a little a

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.970 
should've called my premise a little a
second<00:04:55.010> earlier<00:04:56.650> probably<00:04:57.650> I<00:04:57.680> coulda<00:04:57.710> got<00:04:57.950> a

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
second earlier probably I coulda got a

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.950 
second earlier probably I coulda got a
like<00:04:58.100> a<00:04:58.130> triple<00:04:58.580> but<00:04:59.000> didn't<00:04:59.450> see<00:04:59.480> I<00:04:59.570> call<00:04:59.810> it

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
like a triple but didn't see I call it

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
and right here and I see like a couple

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.680 
and right here and I see like a couple
guys<00:05:02.360> been<00:05:02.540> going<00:05:02.570> down<00:05:02.900> on<00:05:03.280> and<00:05:04.480> game<00:05:05.480> ends

which if that game lasted a little
longer<00:05:07.940> I<00:05:08.180> probably<00:05:08.690> get<00:05:09.050> I<00:05:09.230> would<00:05:09.380> have<00:05:09.470> got

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
longer I probably get I would have got
