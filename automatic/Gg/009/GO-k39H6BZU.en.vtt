00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello good morning I'm another happy and today 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.019
 I 'm going to teach you how to make these stars 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:13.830
 christmas stars to perform 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:17.160
 with the never- beats or the islands 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.529
 these little balls are made of 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.289
 plastic and basically these hours 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.529
 I bought in Ikea what they cost 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.809
 approximately five euros and for 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.180
 another part we will need our bases 

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:32.579
 that also in this case you can 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.370
 find in ikea comes with a round 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.070
 square heart-shaped and another 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.250
 big white color according 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.930
 then to realize these stars 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.870
 we will need as I said the hama 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.930
 bits one of the bases in this case the 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.480
 that we are going to use is the round 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.920
 a piece of vegetable paper or paper 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.969
 oven 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.969
 and an iron 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.590
 to begin with let's do the 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:05.140
 star in this case I have chosen the 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:08.220
 red color and I have them away from 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.680
 agreement and based on the round 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.979
 we will begin to fill in we will look for the 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.979
 half 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:21.800
 this icon 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.800
 and we will begin to fill 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.790
 If it seems too difficult you 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.790
 you can help with a pair of tweezers 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.880
 Four. Five 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:54.050
 as you will see I have made a row a line 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.630
 with seven of the balls leaving one 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.720
 space at the beginning and now we will leave 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.100
 also a space after the seventh 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.780
 and we continue 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.780
 with 7 more 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:34.460
 is the next step will be move from 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:37.810
 diagonal shape therefore based on 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:43.330
 At this point in the center we will continue 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.330
 for this diagonal here with 7 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:10.470
 now we will move to the diagonal that 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.400
 we have closer and we repeat again 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.400
 the same 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.790
 one 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.270
 no no 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.880
 we already have half of our star 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:40.470
 now we must continue on the side 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.470
 inverse in the same way 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.739
 this is an ideal workshop to do with 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.709
 children since in this case we are 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.900
 working on the theme of Christmas and 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:59.630
 let's make the stars but 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:04.000
 they can perform countless jobs 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.000
 with different shapes and colors 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.530
 little Star 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.370
 okay now we have the 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:38.610
 structure of the star 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:42.090
 and we are going to make the outside 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:45.300
 to make this same star what 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:51.110
 we will need is to count 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:53.780
 four points each of more 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:58.000
 star blades has the fourth 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.000
 right next point we will place 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.509
 eleven 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.509
 3. 4 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.520
 we will have to place 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.050
 two 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.050
 and three 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.419
 and two more forming a v 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.860
 and we repeat 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:45.800
 this part is a little bit harder in 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:48.410
 this case if you want you can use the 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:51.550
 tweezers since being all the pieces 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.550
 much more stuck 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.590
 but with a little patience 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:12.729
 You see there is a gap between 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:12.729
 of each of the blades of the star 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:31.099
 remember three 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:31.099
 on the one hand 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:36.290
 and we closed the ub with 2 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:08.050
 very well we already have our star and 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:10.220
 now to finish simply 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:13.740
 we will place 

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:15.960
 the gestalt or oven paper 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:18.289
 on top of the star and with the iron 

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:21.120
 hot hot iron we will do during 

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:25.800
 approximately about 30 seconds until 

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:31.250
 see the pellets or hama melt 

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:31.250
 bits and they look like this
