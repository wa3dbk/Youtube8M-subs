00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.540
 four days of pure sunshine on the 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.260
 Herzberg has it in the story 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.660
 the legendary hippie festival the 1968 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.500
 his first edition did not celebrate yet 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.500
 too often given 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.930
 shadow was therefore also a lot 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.640
 asked good in 2013 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.590
 Everybody where last year 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.630
 Visitors had nothing to do with it 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.160
 to sink muddy and his shoes to the 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.990
 snatch mud again 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.120
 there the visitors received in this 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:43.080
 year a nice dry soil and 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.080
 all the most beautiful sunshine 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.830
 after the mud fight last year 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.660
 we have these too 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.430
 Sunshine honestly deserves all and 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.320
 Now we enjoy it all the more because 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.210
 we know how it could be 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.890
 is the most relaxed festival i have 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.690
 raab is really in the long run 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.030
 organization it works everything 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.430
 everything works you get everywhere 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.900
 it's wonderful the people are good 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.430
 whimsy and you have the sunshine 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.430
 It can not be better all day 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.900
 the festival visitors are with their 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.450
 inner attitude, however, every year 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.470
 extremely supple no matter if rain is soggy 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.659
 or sunshine 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.670
 you appreciate the total package on the 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.830
 Herzberg Festival is offered 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.150
 and that does not just consist of the colorful 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.580
 musical offer 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.690
 It also includes living together 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.690
 the festival reported 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.710
 freedom relaxation and just 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.210
 clear sky and just beautiful it is 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.320
 kind of a very friendly and somehow 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:51.360
 familial and a wonderful feast where 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.360
 that works very well together 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:59.070
 because many people are actually that 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.170
 often with playroom often 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.250
 and I do not know the music 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.500
 be great lead 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.910
 I have not been here for years 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.020
 times a blow or experienced 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.179
 somehow strife 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.630
 this harmony actually works this world 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.550
 Sham world does not give this beautiful one 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.220
 Scheinwelt opens its doors in each case 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.989
 already on tuesdays in the festival week and 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.420
 It will not be long before the freak city 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.550
 the camping meadow right on the ground up 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.500
 is filled to the last place 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.780
 on Thursdays then there is that 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.730
 music program and who to the weekend 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.920
 The driver arrives at the horse paddock 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.200
 cozy cookie and every year 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.330
 Come to the Herzberg by the thousands 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.970
 to celebrate the respective motto 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:44.860
 this year, art of peace was the 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:48.010
 art of peace is the core 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:52.690
 of course the people from 1968 on top 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:54.519
 the castle in the castle were already there 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.130
 These are all convinced 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:59.470
 regular guests form the nucleus of the 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.720
 so-called old hippies and children's grandchildren 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.280
 and so on next to none 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.709
 very big coalition 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.140
 which one finds often not so funny with 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.110
 their power generators and at night 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.420
 we're drinking and so on but you 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.459
 actually belong to it too and that 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.390
 Of course, it also records the culture 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:21.940
 we do not exclude food 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.880
 Drink a bit of shopping for 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.530
 the kids 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.540
 the good life is during the castle 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.030
 Herzberg festival throughout the day 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.590
 taken care of and go before three o'clock at night 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.590
 here the lights are not off
