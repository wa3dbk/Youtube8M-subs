if that's what actually happened but he
had<00:01:22.110> plenty<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.409> cultures<00:01:22.710> actually<00:01:22.920> do<00:01:23.250> it's

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.240 
gonna really deck him out in full body
armor<00:02:44.610> that's<00:02:45.239> a<00:02:45.510> bit<00:02:45.660> counterintuitive<00:02:46.250> so

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
armor that's a bit counterintuitive so

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.830 
armor that's a bit counterintuitive so
hopefully<00:02:47.580> it<00:02:47.670> doesn't<00:02:47.849> mind<00:02:48.180> but<00:02:48.480> if<00:02:48.569> he<00:02:48.660> does

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
hopefully it doesn't mind but if he does

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.240 
hopefully it doesn't mind but if he does
then<00:02:49.019> I'll<00:02:49.140> just<00:02:49.319> have<00:02:49.470> to<00:02:49.500> redo<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.040> entire

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
then I'll just have to redo the entire

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.100 
then I'll just have to redo the entire
thing<00:02:50.370> but<00:02:50.730> in<00:02:50.879> my<00:02:51.150> mind<00:02:51.180> from<00:02:51.810> a<00:02:51.959> logical

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
thing but in my mind from a logical

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.589 
thing but in my mind from a logical
point<00:02:52.590> of<00:02:52.680> view<00:02:52.860> it<00:02:52.980> makes<00:02:53.129> more<00:02:53.340> sense<00:02:53.700> to<00:02:54.000> to

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
point of view it makes more sense to to

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.330 
point of view it makes more sense to to
have<00:02:54.780> a<00:02:54.810> very<00:02:56.599> scanty<00:02:57.599> armored<00:02:58.019> so<00:02:58.709> as<00:02:58.890> to<00:02:59.099> be

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:26.210 
turned out to be something for a sort of
an<00:03:23.220> RPG<00:03:23.879> game<00:03:24.440> that<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.620> guy<00:03:25.769> was<00:03:25.799> either

coming up with or had made I don't quite
remember<00:03:28.489> so<00:03:29.489> I<00:03:29.519> think<00:03:29.670> this<00:03:30.000> is<00:03:30.060> a<00:03:30.440> similar

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
remember so I think this is a similar

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.940 
remember so I think this is a similar
situation<00:03:31.819> some<00:03:32.819> of<00:03:32.909> these<00:03:33.000> stories<00:03:33.390> are

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
situation some of these stories are

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.280 
situation some of these stories are
interesting<00:03:34.950> but<00:03:35.780> looking<00:03:36.780> at<00:03:36.900> it<00:03:36.930> from<00:03:37.140> the

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
interesting but looking at it from the

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.140 
interesting but looking at it from the
outside<00:03:37.319> like<00:03:37.920> I<00:03:38.190> know<00:03:38.280> what<00:03:38.580> it's<00:03:38.730> like<00:03:38.790> for

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
outside like I know what it's like for

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.580 
outside like I know what it's like for
it<00:03:39.269> to<00:03:39.299> be<00:03:39.420> completely<00:03:39.599> subjective<00:03:40.049> when<00:03:40.500> it

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
it to be completely subjective when it

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.160 
it to be completely subjective when it
comes<00:03:40.799> to<00:03:41.040> your<00:03:41.849> creation<00:03:42.510> but<00:03:42.780> looking<00:03:43.049> at<00:03:43.140> it

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
comes to your creation but looking at it

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.539 
comes to your creation but looking at it
from<00:03:43.349> the<00:03:43.470> outside<00:03:43.500> some<00:03:43.980> of<00:03:44.099> these<00:03:44.220> things

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
from the outside some of these things

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.869 
from the outside some of these things
could<00:03:44.879> use<00:03:45.840> a<00:03:45.870> little<00:03:46.110> bit<00:03:46.319> of<00:03:46.459> touching<00:03:47.459> up<00:03:47.730> in

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
could use a little bit of touching up in

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:49.729 
could use a little bit of touching up in
the<00:03:47.970> logical<00:03:48.360> point<00:03:48.629> in<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.080> logical<00:03:49.440> sense

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
the logical point in the logical sense

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.009 
the logical point in the logical sense
because<00:03:50.040> there<00:03:50.909> are<00:03:51.000> some<00:03:51.209> elements<00:03:51.360> in<00:03:51.870> these

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
because there are some elements in these

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.830 
because there are some elements in these
both<00:03:52.680> of<00:03:52.890> these<00:03:52.980> stories<00:03:53.430> that<00:03:53.700> don't<00:03:54.629> really

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
both of these stories that don't really

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.860 
both of these stories that don't really
make<00:03:55.140> that<00:03:55.620> much<00:03:55.680> sense<00:03:56.510> if<00:03:57.510> you<00:03:57.659> were<00:03:57.750> to

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
make that much sense if you were to

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.410 
make that much sense if you were to
compare<00:03:57.989> it<00:03:58.230> with<00:03:58.349> classical<00:03:59.040> or<00:03:59.819> PG<00:04:02.269> way<00:04:03.269> of

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
compare it with classical or PG way of

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.460 
compare it with classical or PG way of
being<00:04:03.720> or<00:04:04.080> way<00:04:04.590> of<00:04:04.799> building<00:04:05.430> characters<00:04:06.470> so

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
being or way of building characters so

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:08.960 
being or way of building characters so

waiting to see if the guy approves of

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.930
