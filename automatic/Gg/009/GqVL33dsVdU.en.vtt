00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.590
 Enrico Bravo is it's a 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.620
 victory was expected and we saw 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:10.910
 no no no my audience 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.680
 rebels' camargo show he 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:16.220
 expected that joel had run well 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.930
 but to win he thought not win he the 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.030
 done in the manner of the forts he was 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.770
 immediately at the forefront of the fight he has 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:32.720
 placed several accelerations made 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:34.160
 an incredible thing possible is the 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.140
 only chance was to take the rope 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.100
 as soon as possible these materials 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.060
 make the back of the mans universe 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.830
 did he doubt a moment and what 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.340
 that he thought the universe had to prove 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.340
 their party 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:02:04.600
 and Saturday vincere to people writing 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:06.630
 past part they thought they 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.920
 still had gas but hey 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.360
 it's only at the pole that 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.420
 glimpses because they gain from it 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.930
 hill and not win much but 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.080
 good he thought he still had 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.739
 can go get them 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.260
 is it a particular way 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.260
 to win in France and we had to play 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.880
 Paris 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:38.640
 it's a group in France it's helping itself 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:45.769
 to reindeer and victory what is it in 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:48.269
 France is really thank you philippe 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.480
 defeated in the sprint but beaten with 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.250
 honors 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.230
 good bah quite I would like that 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.190
 horse to endure the race he went 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.190
 shown a little too noisy 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.760
 so finally the Italian asked me 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.830
 a relay and then 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.060
 I loved the past as much as I stayed 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.430
 behind for quillan lets pass to 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.750
 noted find me a little bit further 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.520
 so after I would have liked it to be 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.660
 as casual kakanj but there he 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.340
 had a little more freshness a month 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.800
 and a half without running and then 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.880
 and then here is 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.960
 we did the game of the Duke of the Italian who 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.180
 was stronger than us at the sprint 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.230
 despite everything so today the record 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.370
 the test is low since all my 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.360
 horse has behaved well I am very 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.940
 very satisfied with his race 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.070
 I may not have not chosen the 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.990
 better tactics but I am very 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.250
 happy with the race of my horse you 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.030
 do a lot of self criticism but good 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.170
 we still feel like 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.450
 the outside that you manage very well 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.630
 the career of your champion is different 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.730
 thing 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.070
 in front of the difficulty right now it's 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.030
 World of season 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.590
 training it was a point 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.630
 essential for you today that they 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.650
 run well I would say that in addition there 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.150
 had worked a little bit less strong 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.580
 in recent times since so it takes 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.700
 manage the rise and then the work 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.230
 so I knew not made a world where I 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.820
 was from the point of view of my work I 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.270
 think that today he gave a very 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.820
 good value 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.520
 and then I am very very proud of this 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.270
 performance the pyro timoko he makes a 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.560
 very good value 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.360
 yes he makes a very good comeback 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.190
 especially he makes a good comeback and 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.780
 in many ways the first is 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.160
 that this winter he had a problem the 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.500
 so definitely lasts a little 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.489
 pain somewhere alas he was 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.780
 perfect besides that is to say that the 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:23.550
 pain is gone makes a nice value 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.260
 because it's a race and rhythm 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.210
 last year and won this 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.370
 test in this fifth year 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:33.180
 years is so that means it's not 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:35.010
 far from its best level and especially 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.960
 it's a horse that maybe according to 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.000
 I dare performer before and myself 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.760
 did not bother behind that true that he 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.560
 is it was rather pretty good except we 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.560
 felt a horse that lacked 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.180
 competition and so I always 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.070
 been a little bit paced in the 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.870
 exactly the pace is what 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:55.300
 you felt that you were on the pond 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:57.460
 a hardcore all manner 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.870
 I really like it goes naturally 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.879
 so I did not have to force philippe 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.949
 daugeard his horse here and me so he 

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:05.020
 I did not try to resist him but 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:07.060
 when enrico bellei his views gave the 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.830
 wind and he put a real acceleration 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.169
 to come to take the head a philippe 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.879
 daugeard who had let him spin a 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:14.800
 little bit so already he had taken a 

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:16.629
 fifteen meters on us there was a 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.580
 first relay and after philippe 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:20.199
 daugeard he left coiled he is 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.490
 decided to break his horse's action 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:23.490
 which makes us behind 

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:27.409
 There was no false pace was 

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:28.399
 always been on the same tempo and proof 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:30.169
 is it that if you look 

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:31.489
 the arrival the first five of 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:33.469
 the arrival is the 500 euros of the 

00:05:31.489 --> 00:05:34.939
 rope all the horses that were in 

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:36.349
 the wagon of or what we are trying to 

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:39.979
 bring closer to 3 in front and we appear 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:42.019
 the arrival you now maybe the 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:45.589
 driver timoko you become in all 

00:05:42.019 --> 00:05:47.960
 case at first glance not that I know 

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:50.360
 it's a freelance 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:53.229
 thank you beautiful bus it was me I'm after 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:56.000
 a dog a service provider 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:58.580
 it made me very happy but it is 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.090
 expected to resort abroad with 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.430
 goal in two groups 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:04.069
 and then what recourse a blow 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.780
 France his coach told me that he 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:08.300
 would also like to find once 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:11.000
 so the owner's opinion is behind 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:14.180
 oh that's okay so I'm leading so here 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.990
 if broadband I'm free but it's 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.690
 not in tune with the times 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.800
 the message is past and diversifying and 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.620
 stuff is still some reasons for 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.690
 satisfaction with it ends well traille 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.979
 finished very well they never say where 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.199
 we knew we had to have the 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:29.630
 luck we are not fast soon fast 

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:31.669
 that's it but you have two damage because 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:34.460
 it was the wagon of the rope that 

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:35.990
 was the good wagon and we redid it 4 5 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.550
 lengths on horses like timoko 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:40.009
 so I think it's fine with 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.570
 his earnings he has with the program that 

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:44.720
 going to have this summer I think we'll have 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:46.909
 happy days with him who has been 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.590
 passed yesterday and featuring starting 

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:50.090
 series of halls is the other star she 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.070
 do not know which one is the most 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.240
 strong one day every time his crazy 

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:55.880
 was for the first time anyway 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:58.360
 makes the mistake so I am sincerely 

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:01.760
 I think that really start autostart 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:03.230
 it's not his real sport 

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.750
 11-3 it was impossible to come back after 

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:07.370
 web as we can see the race 1 the 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:10.070
 first five are the five during the 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:13.910
 rope the wagon of eye to paris to nobody 

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:16.820
 on arrival so here I think it 

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:18.560
 explains everything disappointed we are always a 

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.910
 little disappointed not to wash wash arrive with 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.830
 such things because it's been a year 

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:25.690
 what is the skin and theo balance so 

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:25.690
 we are always disappointed it's normal 

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:45.150
 m 

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.360
 i
