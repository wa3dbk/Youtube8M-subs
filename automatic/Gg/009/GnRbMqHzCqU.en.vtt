00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
virtually one so there's all the android

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.850 
virtually one so there's all the android
stuff<00:02:08.180> and<00:02:08.450> the<00:02:08.570> TV<00:02:08.780> staff<00:02:09.170> and<00:02:09.440> everything<00:02:09.770> is

stuff and the TV staff and everything is

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.880 
stuff and the TV staff and everything is
overlaid<00:02:10.280> and<00:02:10.640> as<00:02:10.790> in<00:02:11.300> the<00:02:11.420> box<00:02:11.660> there's<00:02:12.260> hdmi

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
overlaid and as in the box there's hdmi

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.610 
overlaid and as in the box there's hdmi
in<00:02:13.130> and<00:02:13.400> out<00:02:13.520> so<00:02:14.180> that<00:02:14.360> is<00:02:14.420> a<00:02:14.510> mi<00:02:14.780> in<00:02:14.990> and<00:02:15.140> out<00:02:15.260> in

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
in and out so that is a mi in and out in

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.050 
in and out so that is a mi in and out in
the<00:02:15.800> demonstration<00:02:16.040> we<00:02:16.490> don't<00:02:16.670> show<00:02:16.790> you<00:02:16.910> the

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
the demonstration we don't show you the

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.810 
the demonstration we don't show you the
hdmi<00:02:17.450> in<00:02:17.630> we<00:02:17.870> focus<00:02:18.170> on<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.380> hdmi<00:02:18.710> out<00:02:18.920> you

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
hdmi in we focus on the hdmi out you

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.190 
hdmi in we focus on the hdmi out you
receive<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.420> connection<00:02:20.840> there's<00:02:21.110> a

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
receive the connection there's a

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.800 
receive the connection there's a
keyboard<00:02:21.530> so<00:02:21.680> it's<00:02:21.920> a<00:02:22.010> kind<00:02:22.160> of<00:02:22.310> IPTV<00:02:22.880> demo<00:02:23.240> in

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
keyboard so it's a kind of IPTV demo in

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.200 
keyboard so it's a kind of IPTV demo in
that<00:02:24.050> case<00:02:24.230> on<00:02:24.710> you<00:02:24.950> have<00:02:25.190> hdmi<00:02:25.700> out<00:02:25.850> which<00:02:26.180> is

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
that case on you have hdmi out which is

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.540 
that case on you have hdmi out which is
going<00:02:26.510> through<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:26.750> TV<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:27.380> you<00:02:28.220> are<00:02:28.370> saying

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
going through the TV and you are saying

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.040 
going through the TV and you are saying
there<00:02:28.730> are<00:02:28.820> some<00:02:28.970> other<00:02:29.150> solution<00:02:29.390> so<00:02:29.810> which

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
there are some other solution so which

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.630 
there are some other solution so which
one<00:02:30.230> is<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.410> top<00:02:30.680> solution<00:02:31.160> right<00:02:31.310> now<00:02:31.490> and

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
one is the top solution right now and

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.420 
one is the top solution right now and
set-top<00:02:31.850> box<00:02:32.180> so<00:02:32.570> today<00:02:33.140> we<00:02:33.620> have<00:02:33.740> a<00:02:33.770> solution

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
set-top box so today we have a solution

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.430 
set-top box so today we have a solution
we<00:02:35.000> have<00:02:35.120> a<00:02:35.150> density<00:02:35.390> solution<00:02:35.900> on<00:02:36.050> we<00:02:36.230> have<00:02:36.320> as

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
we have a density solution on we have as

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.500 
we have a density solution on we have as
well<00:02:36.590> you<00:02:36.860> tried<00:02:37.100> the<00:02:37.340> solution<00:02:37.820> that<00:02:38.480> you

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
well you tried the solution that you

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.210 
well you tried the solution that you
have<00:02:38.720> introduced<00:02:38.930> last<00:02:39.290> year<00:02:39.440> at<00:02:39.680> IDC<00:02:39.950> in

you<00:03:49.750> do<00:03:49.930> what's<00:03:50.319> called<00:03:50.500> a<00:03:51.569> hevc<00:03:52.569> 4k<00:03:53.110> yeah<00:03:54.069> your

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
you do what's called a hevc 4k yeah your

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.430 
you do what's called a hevc 4k yeah your
tidy<00:03:54.879> is<00:03:55.150> 4k<00:03:55.480> so<00:03:55.870> there<00:03:56.080> is<00:03:56.140> two<00:03:56.290> different

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
tidy is 4k so there is two different

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.160 
tidy is 4k so there is two different
name<00:03:56.769> for<00:03:56.799> a<00:03:57.010> GF<00:03:57.430> okay<00:03:57.760> so<00:03:58.120> it's<00:03:58.420> the<00:03:58.750> hevc

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
name for a GF okay so it's the hevc

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.720 
name for a GF okay so it's the hevc
Torah<00:03:59.530> is<00:03:59.739> yes<00:04:00.129> in<00:04:00.640> full<00:04:01.120> 4k<00:04:01.709> all<00:04:02.709> the<00:04:02.950> organs

Torah is yes in full 4k all the organs

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.839 
Torah is yes in full 4k all the organs
of<00:04:03.910> okay<00:04:04.239> HEVC<00:04:05.140> decoder<00:04:05.830> it's<00:04:06.220> not<00:04:06.370> a<00:04:06.430> codec<00:04:06.730> it

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
of okay HEVC decoder it's not a codec it

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:08.850 
of okay HEVC decoder it's not a codec it
so<00:04:06.970> decoder<00:04:07.239> okay<00:04:07.720> and<00:04:08.019> so<00:04:08.349> do<00:04:08.530> you<00:04:08.590> do<00:04:08.709> also

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
so decoder okay and so do you do also

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.900 
so decoder okay and so do you do also
some<00:04:09.220> stuff<00:04:09.430> with<00:04:09.579> what's<00:04:09.819> called<00:04:10.030> a<00:04:10.380> doodoo

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
some stuff with what's called a doodoo

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.789 
some stuff with what's called a doodoo
transcoding<00:04:12.910> right<00:04:13.090> yes<00:04:13.690> so<00:04:14.019> is<00:04:14.260> that<00:04:14.290> that

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
transcoding right yes so is that that

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:16.680 
transcoding right yes so is that that
this<00:04:15.010> association<00:04:15.489> so<00:04:15.760> you<00:04:16.030> have<00:04:16.120> a<00:04:16.299> family<00:04:16.450> of

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
this association so you have a family of

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.030 
this association so you have a family of
soc<00:04:17.049> which<00:04:17.350> are<00:04:17.530> based<00:04:17.709> on<00:04:17.769> similar

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
soc which are based on similar

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.159 
soc which are based on similar
architecture<00:04:18.130> one<00:04:18.729> is<00:04:18.880> a<00:04:18.910> can<00:04:19.180> SOC<00:04:19.660> which<00:04:20.049> is

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
architecture one is a can SOC which is

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.440 
architecture one is a can SOC which is
focused<00:04:20.320> on<00:04:20.680> the<00:04:20.799> client<00:04:21.100> so<00:04:21.790> its<00:04:21.940> focus<00:04:22.240> only

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
focused on the client so its focus only

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.900 
focused on the client so its focus only
on<00:04:22.570> the<00:04:22.780> decoding<00:04:23.169> function<00:04:23.590> so<00:04:24.220> it<00:04:24.250> can<00:04:24.700> be<00:04:24.880> a

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
on the decoding function so it can be a

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.960 
on the decoding function so it can be a
HD<00:04:25.540> hevc<00:04:26.139> can<00:04:26.440> be<00:04:26.530> as<00:04:26.650> well<00:04:26.830> Ultra<00:04:27.280> HD<00:04:27.310> HD<00:04:27.910> you

see on then as well we have a sister
family<00:04:30.400> which<00:04:30.610> is<00:04:30.729> called<00:04:30.910> the<00:04:31.060> Monaco<00:04:31.419> family

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
family which is called the Monaco family

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.500 
family which is called the Monaco family
on<00:04:32.350> the<00:04:32.560> moon<00:04:32.710> echo<00:04:32.919> family<00:04:33.250> include<00:04:34.090> a<00:04:34.270> very

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
on the moon echo family include a very

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.260 
on the moon echo family include a very
powerful<00:04:35.020> transcoder<00:04:35.770> so<00:04:36.699> the<00:04:36.850> transcoder

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
powerful transcoder so the transcoder

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.810 
powerful transcoder so the transcoder
this<00:04:37.690> is<00:04:37.870> a<00:04:37.900> very<00:04:38.440> useful<00:04:38.830> in<00:04:39.340> the<00:04:39.520> market

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
this is a very useful in the market

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.400 
this is a very useful in the market
where<00:04:40.060> you<00:04:40.090> want<00:04:40.389> to<00:04:40.510> go<00:04:40.630> from<00:04:40.780> one<00:04:41.020> format<00:04:41.350> to

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
where you want to go from one format to

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.159 
where you want to go from one format to
another<00:04:41.880> typical<00:04:42.880> example<00:04:43.510> is<00:04:43.840> that<00:04:43.960> you

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
another typical example is that you

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:46.469 
another typical example is that you
receiver<00:04:44.530> mpeg-2<00:04:45.160> stream<00:04:45.430> which<00:04:45.789> is<00:04:45.940> interest

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 
receiver mpeg-2 stream which is interest

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:49.230 
receiver mpeg-2 stream which is interest
on<00:04:46.900> you<00:04:47.410> want<00:04:47.560> to<00:04:47.680> display<00:04:47.860> it<00:04:48.130> on<00:04:48.520> a<00:04:48.850> tablet

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
on you want to display it on a tablet

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.270 
on you want to display it on a tablet
the<00:04:49.990> screen<00:04:50.200> of<00:04:50.289> the<00:04:50.320> tablet<00:04:50.410> is<00:04:50.770> progressive

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
the screen of the tablet is progressive

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.089 
the screen of the tablet is progressive
so<00:04:51.970> we<00:04:52.300> are<00:04:52.419> decoding<00:04:52.840> the<00:04:52.990> impact<00:04:53.260> tool<00:04:53.440> we

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:54.099 
so we are decoding the impact tool we

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:56.010 
so we are decoding the impact tool we
are<00:04:54.220> the<00:04:54.370> interesting<00:04:54.910> it<00:04:55.060> only<00:04:55.360> including<00:04:55.900> it

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
are the interesting it only including it

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.930 
are the interesting it only including it
in<00:04:56.050> h.264<00:04:56.650> on<00:04:56.950> sending<00:04:57.250> that<00:04:57.400> to<00:04:57.610> the<00:04:57.700> tablet

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
in h.264 on sending that to the tablet

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.000 
in h.264 on sending that to the tablet
on<00:04:58.180> real<00:04:58.660> time<00:04:58.900> now<00:04:59.289> this<00:04:59.440> is<00:04:59.560> done<00:04:59.740> in<00:04:59.770> real

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010 
on real time now this is done in real

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.070 
on real time now this is done in real
time<00:05:00.220> and<00:05:00.490> we<00:05:00.610> can<00:05:00.729> even<00:05:01.030> serve<00:05:01.270> more<00:05:01.690> than<00:05:01.720> one

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
time and we can even serve more than one

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.589 
time and we can even serve more than one
client<00:05:02.380> at<00:05:02.919> the<00:05:03.010> same<00:05:03.280> time<00:05:03.460> more<00:05:04.060> than<00:05:04.210> one<00:05:04.360> so

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:04.599 
client at the same time more than one so

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:06.390 
client at the same time more than one so
so<00:05:05.200> it<00:05:05.289> will<00:05:05.410> be<00:05:05.530> in<00:05:05.620> the<00:05:05.680> box<00:05:05.860> at<00:05:06.010> home<00:05:06.039> where

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
so it will be in the box at home where

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.950 
so it will be in the box at home where
there<00:05:06.490> will<00:05:06.550> be<00:05:06.610> a<00:05:06.760> Wi-Fi<00:05:07.120> hotspot<00:05:07.150> and<00:05:07.690> people

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
there will be a Wi-Fi hotspot and people

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.200 
there will be a Wi-Fi hotspot and people
can<00:05:08.139> stream<00:05:08.440> exactly<00:05:09.099> so<00:05:09.370> typically<00:05:09.700> you<00:05:10.030> will

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
can stream exactly so typically you will

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.909

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:18.590 
the open rd care system so we see a big

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:21.309 
the open rd care system so we see a big

00:07:25.959 --> 00:07:25.969 
so we don't focus too much on our DK but

00:07:25.969 --> 00:07:28.059 
so we don't focus too much on our DK but
