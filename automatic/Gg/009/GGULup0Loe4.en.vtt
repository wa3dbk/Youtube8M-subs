and you'll see as this drill progresses
they<00:00:17.400> really<00:00:17.760> get<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.029> feel<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.300> leaving<00:00:18.750> the

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
they really get the feel of leaving the

they really get the feel of leaving the
glove<00:00:19.080> out<00:00:19.230> front<00:00:19.650> so<00:00:20.189> you<00:00:20.250> guys<00:00:20.460> have<00:00:20.640> been

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
glove out front so you guys have been

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.189 
glove out front so you guys have been
through<00:00:20.970> this<00:00:21.119> let's<00:00:21.359> go<00:00:21.480> ahead<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.779> do<00:00:21.900> it

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
through this let's go ahead and do it

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.259 
through this let's go ahead and do it
find<00:00:22.650> your<00:00:22.830> equal<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.250> opposite<00:00:23.609> your<00:00:24.060> knees

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
find your equal and opposite your knees

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.929 
find your equal and opposite your knees
are<00:00:24.480> squared<00:00:24.810> off<00:00:25.070> knees<00:00:26.070> are<00:00:26.250> squared<00:00:26.519> off<00:00:26.699> so

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
are squared off knees are squared off so

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.179 
are squared off knees are squared off so
that<00:00:26.970> when<00:00:27.240> you<00:00:27.390> throw<00:00:27.720> it's<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.619> same<00:00:28.890> thing

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
that when you throw it's the same thing

ground with your legs the bottom half

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.799 
ground with your legs the bottom half
has<00:00:34.469> actually<00:00:34.950> squared<00:00:35.760> off<00:00:36.000> when<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.510> arms

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
has actually squared off when the arms

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.000 
has actually squared off when the arms
come<00:00:37.079> through<00:00:37.380> so<00:00:38.129> its<00:00:38.370> feet<00:00:38.700> torso<00:00:39.690> arms<00:00:40.050> now
