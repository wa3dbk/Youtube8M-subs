 where are they going to have a little bit more of 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.320
 reference 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.810

 test page then click here or 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.680
 simply finish 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.170
 once the installation of the 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.870
 printer 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.620
 we enter devices again and 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.480
 printers 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.480
 to see where is what we installed 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.730
 we click right 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:12.310
 printing preferences 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.310
 and here we select the ether 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.920
 and apply and accept but before we go to 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.750
 add a new size that is the trade 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:25.240
 that do not come in the printers 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.240
 in this case we enter the option 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:35.660
 paper size that asks for the name 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.880
 then we put him 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.770
 let's put the free what 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.980
 We have previously configured the 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:45.400
 Free size in the photocopier 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:48.560
 then it has to match the 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:52.070
 programming that we did in or with the 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.660
 assignment of the free in the in the 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.790
 photocopier 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.780
 in the same way 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.459
 in millimeters and the width that we have 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.519
 assigned in the own photo now we have 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:07.359
 to type the same width in this case 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.359
 the 16th 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:14.659
 and this will be 330 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:17.230
 330 good many depending on what size 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:19.600
 or what 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:23.260
 the size that you use in trade 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.860
 we use in Bolivia is 216 per 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:29.129
 330 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.379
 then we tell you to register 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:33.449
 in this case I already have it registered 

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:35.369
 so it's going to come out once 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:38.399
 click is register will come out in the 

00:04:35.369 --> 00:04:43.499
 bottom of the list of sizes of 

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:45.839
 free paper and we just say ok and 

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:47.249
 the official size is already registered in 

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:49.380
 this case I'm going to put it cancel 

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:52.650
 because I already have it registered 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.630
 and once done click here and we will 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.470
 see the size that we have registered here 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.810
 down 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:01.400
 free and just then we say 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.990
 apply and accept 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.480
 and it is already 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.640
 that would be all practically there is like 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:11.350
 they will have seen is something very simple 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.350
 and with this it has to work 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.970
