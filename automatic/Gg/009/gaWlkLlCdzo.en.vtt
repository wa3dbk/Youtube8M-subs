for the bomb site I've pulled this off

actually you go right here push yourself

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.399 
actually you go right here push yourself
up<00:01:49.280> along<00:01:49.550> this<00:01:49.670> wall<00:01:49.940> and<00:01:50.360> you<00:01:51.080> make<00:01:51.260> the

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
up along this wall and you make the

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.290 
up along this wall and you make the
space<00:01:51.770> in<00:01:52.130> between<00:01:52.190> these<00:01:52.580> two<00:01:52.729> boxes<00:01:52.940> the

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
space in between these two boxes the

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.320 
space in between these two boxes the
size<00:01:53.540> of<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:53.870> timer<00:01:54.370> so<00:01:55.370> this<00:01:55.520> is<00:01:55.640> I<00:01:55.670> mean<00:01:56.210> this

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
size of the timer so this is I mean this

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.210 
size of the timer so this is I mean this
might<00:01:56.540> seem<00:01:56.750> absurd<00:01:57.170> to<00:01:57.500> line<00:01:57.650> up<00:01:57.800> but<00:01:58.010> this<00:01:58.100> is

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
might seem absurd to line up but this is

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.469 
might seem absurd to line up but this is
how<00:01:58.310> I<00:01:58.340> always<00:01:58.460> line<00:01:58.760> it<00:01:58.880> up<00:01:58.940> I<00:01:59.090> just<00:01:59.240> looked<00:01:59.390> up

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
how I always line it up I just looked up

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.149 
how I always line it up I just looked up
really<00:01:59.720> quick<00:01:59.900> until<00:02:00.500> it's<00:02:00.590> straighten<00:02:00.979> and

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
really quick until it's straighten and

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.370 
really quick until it's straighten and
once<00:02:01.850> that's<00:02:02.000> there<00:02:02.299> I<00:02:02.540> actually<00:02:03.080> shoot<00:02:03.229> the

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
once that's there I actually shoot the

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.380 
once that's there I actually shoot the
lower<00:02:03.590> left<00:02:03.950> corner<00:02:04.070> of<00:02:04.430> this<00:02:04.670> wall<00:02:04.970> and<00:02:05.000> this

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
lower left corner of this wall and this

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.180 
lower left corner of this wall and this
is<00:02:05.510> the<00:02:05.630> middle<00:02:05.990> of<00:02:06.110> the<00:02:06.260> bottom<00:02:06.560> of<00:02:06.680> be<00:02:06.860> stairs

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
is the middle of the bottom of be stairs

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.219 
is the middle of the bottom of be stairs
so<00:02:08.060> this<00:02:08.209> is<00:02:08.330> a<00:02:08.360> really<00:02:08.569> good<00:02:08.780> lay<00:02:08.869> around<00:02:08.989> as

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
so this is a really good lay around as

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.509 
so this is a really good lay around as
well<00:02:09.379> because<00:02:09.619> like<00:02:09.739> I<00:02:09.830> said<00:02:10.009> they're<00:02:10.399> not

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.900 
well because like I said they're not
they're<00:02:11.030> not<00:02:11.530> they're<00:02:12.530> not<00:02:12.680> they<00:02:13.490> can't<00:02:13.700> see

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
they're not they're not they can't see

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.000 
they're not they're not they can't see

that's one of those things where you can

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.030 
that's one of those things where you can
just<00:05:47.450> be<00:05:47.570> doing<00:05:47.870> multiple<00:05:48.320> things<00:05:48.500> here<00:05:48.770> or

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:49.040 
just be doing multiple things here or

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.860 
just be doing multiple things here or
there<00:05:49.100> in<00:05:49.490> sight<00:05:49.760> all<00:05:49.970> right<00:05:50.120> I<00:05:50.330> think<00:05:50.750> using

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870 
there in sight all right I think using

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.120 
there in sight all right I think using
the<00:05:50.960> backhand<00:05:51.290> side<00:05:51.410> I<00:05:51.470> heard<00:05:51.650> a<00:05:51.710> move<00:05:51.860> lady's

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.130 
the backhand side I heard a move lady's

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:53.800 
the backhand side I heard a move lady's
family<00:05:52.430> and<00:05:53.030> it's<00:05:53.180> another<00:05:53.360> one<00:05:53.570> of<00:05:53.690> those

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
family and it's another one of those

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.660 
family and it's another one of those
spots<00:05:54.020> for<00:05:54.260> people<00:05:54.320> and<00:05:54.650> I<00:05:54.710> not<00:05:55.070> know<00:05:55.370> that<00:05:55.550> you

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:55.670 
spots for people and I not know that you

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.460 
spots for people and I not know that you
calculated<00:05:56.390> and<00:05:56.510> that's<00:05:56.960> definitely<00:05:57.170> how<00:05:57.440> I

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:57.470 
calculated and that's definitely how I

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.780 
calculated and that's definitely how I
initially<00:05:57.860> would<00:05:58.160> pull<00:05:58.370> it<00:05:58.460> off<00:05:58.550> a<00:05:58.580> lot

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:58.790 
initially would pull it off a lot

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.090 
initially would pull it off a lot
reverse<00:05:59.390> proteins<00:05:59.900> I<00:06:00.080> didn't<00:06:00.380> think<00:06:00.590> I<00:06:00.770> knew

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:01.100 
reverse proteins I didn't think I knew

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.470 
reverse proteins I didn't think I knew
the<00:06:01.220> spam<00:06:01.490> or<00:06:01.730> didn't<00:06:01.940> even<00:06:01.970> know<00:06:02.150> that<00:06:02.180> was<00:06:02.450> a

the spam or didn't even know that was a

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.390 
the spam or didn't even know that was a
spam<00:06:02.810> and<00:06:03.080> I<00:06:03.470> would<00:06:03.620> just<00:06:03.710> pull<00:06:03.890> that<00:06:03.920> him<00:06:04.310> off

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
spam and I would just pull that him off

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.160 
spam and I would just pull that him off
and<00:06:04.610> I'd<00:06:04.700> get<00:06:04.880> a<00:06:04.910> free<00:06:05.120> kill<00:06:05.360> and<00:06:05.840> gaining<00:06:06.140> that

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:06.170 
and I'd get a free kill and gaining that

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.110 
and I'd get a free kill and gaining that
number<00:06:06.500> advantage<00:06:06.860> to<00:06:07.040> spam<00:06:07.340> it's<00:06:07.820> not<00:06:07.970> only

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120 
number advantage to spam it's not only

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.850

devastating<00:06:08.720> to<00:06:08.810> them<00:06:08.960> mentally<00:06:09.230> but<00:06:09.440> it's<00:06:09.620> so

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
devastating to them mentally but it's so

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.500 
devastating to them mentally but it's so
advantageous<00:06:10.280> to<00:06:10.760> us<00:06:10.790> because<00:06:11.180> we<00:06:11.300> didn't

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:11.510 
advantageous to us because we didn't

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:12.910 
advantageous to us because we didn't
have<00:06:11.600> to<00:06:11.690> using<00:06:11.900> a<00:06:11.960> flash<00:06:12.200> grenade<00:06:12.500> so<00:06:12.680> we<00:06:12.770> just

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:12.920 
have to using a flash grenade so we just

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.780 
have to using a flash grenade so we just
