00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
that 29 to walk up that race track he

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.280 
that 29 to walk up that race track he
got<00:01:48.460> those<00:01:48.670> left-side<00:01:49.180> tires<00:01:49.510> down<00:01:49.870> on<00:01:50.140> the

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
got those left-side tires down on the

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.990 
got those left-side tires down on the
apron<00:01:50.470> which<00:01:50.950> is<00:01:51.100> a<00:01:51.130> different<00:01:51.610> angle<00:01:51.729> than

apron which is a different angle than
the<00:01:52.030> banking<00:01:52.450> I<00:01:52.540> think<00:01:52.810> that<00:01:52.930> caused<00:01:53.170> him<00:01:53.410> to

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440
