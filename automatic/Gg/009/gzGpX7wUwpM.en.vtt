milk ricotta cheese I really think the
whole<00:01:37.979> milk<00:01:38.220> works<00:01:38.490> better<00:01:38.820> than<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.090> skim

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
whole milk works better than the skim

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.819 
whole milk works better than the skim
milk<00:01:39.659> or<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.869> non-fat<00:01:40.350> ricotta

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
milk or the non-fat ricotta

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.649
