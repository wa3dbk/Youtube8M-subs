NZXT new media studio and show you what

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.690 
NZXT new media studio and show you what
we<00:00:06.060> use<00:00:06.330> for<00:00:06.660> backups<00:00:07.500> around<00:00:07.799> here<00:00:08.040> so<00:00:08.309> this

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
we use for backups around here so this

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.320 
we use for backups around here so this
is<00:00:08.970> wheels<00:00:09.450> desk<00:00:10.349> he's<00:00:10.769> our<00:00:11.099> primary<00:00:11.790> editor

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
is wheels desk he's our primary editor

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.810 
is wheels desk he's our primary editor
and<00:00:12.540> as<00:00:13.469> such<00:00:13.920> he's<00:00:14.219> dealing<00:00:14.490> with<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.639> lot<00:00:14.759> of

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
and as such he's dealing with a lot of

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.189 
and as such he's dealing with a lot of
video<00:00:15.089> files<00:00:15.299> so<00:00:15.480> he's<00:00:15.599> got<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:15.750> lot<00:00:15.870> of<00:00:15.929> footage

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
video files so he's got a lot of footage

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.830 
video files so he's got a lot of footage
if<00:00:16.680> you<00:00:16.890> look<00:00:17.010> over<00:00:17.160> here<00:00:17.279> we<00:00:18.060> were<00:00:18.330> using<00:00:18.600> this

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
if you look over here we were using this

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.290 
if you look over here we were using this
old<00:00:19.020> drobo<00:00:19.590> machine<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.520> just<00:00:20.730> really<00:00:21.270> wasn't

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
old drobo machine it just really wasn't

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.450 
old drobo machine it just really wasn't
cutting<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:21.960> it's<00:00:22.140> only<00:00:22.320> got<00:00:22.470> USB<00:00:22.740> 2.0<00:00:23.039> a

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
cutting it it's only got USB 2.0 a

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.640 
cutting it it's only got USB 2.0 a
couple<00:00:23.730> firewires<00:00:24.150> there<00:00:24.420> but<00:00:24.660> yeah<00:00:25.500> it's

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
couple firewires there but yeah it's

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.830 
couple firewires there but yeah it's
just<00:00:25.830> not<00:00:25.980> not<00:00:26.670> good<00:00:26.849> enough<00:00:26.880> so<00:00:27.269> now<00:00:27.449> we<00:00:27.510> moved

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
just not not good enough so now we moved

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.290 
just not not good enough so now we moved
over<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.170> this<00:00:28.320> drobo<00:00:28.859> it's<00:00:29.519> better<00:00:29.880> it's<00:00:30.090> got

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
over to this drobo it's better it's got

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.290 
over to this drobo it's better it's got
USB<00:00:30.599> 3.0<00:00:31.500> so<00:00:31.949> that's<00:00:32.520> letting<00:00:32.880> us<00:00:33.059> use<00:00:33.090> a

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
USB 3.0 so that's letting us use a

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.880 
USB 3.0 so that's letting us use a
little<00:00:33.600> faster<00:00:33.899> footage<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:34.320> that's<00:00:34.469> good<00:00:34.710> or

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
little faster footage so that's good or

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.910 
little faster footage so that's good or
speed<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:35.640> mean<00:00:35.910> so<00:00:36.239> instead<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.290> big<00:00:37.500> drobo

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
speed I mean so instead of the big drobo

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.920 
speed I mean so instead of the big drobo
we<00:00:38.070> could<00:00:38.309> have<00:00:38.430> just<00:00:38.640> stuffed<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.600> know<00:00:39.719> his

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
we could have just stuffed you know his

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.930 
we could have just stuffed you know his
system<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.559> gills<00:00:40.860> with<00:00:41.040> hard<00:00:41.430> drives<00:00:41.670> but

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
system to the gills with hard drives but

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.459 
system to the gills with hard drives but
then<00:00:42.120> nobody<00:00:42.629> else<00:00:42.750> would<00:00:42.840> be<00:00:42.960> able<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.200> do<00:00:43.290> any

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
then nobody else would be able to do any

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.529 
then nobody else would be able to do any
backups<00:00:43.920> this<00:00:44.160> way<00:00:44.340> we<00:00:44.489> have<00:00:44.640> this<00:00:44.820> drobo<00:00:45.360> and

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
backups this way we have this drobo and

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.630 
backups this way we have this drobo and
we<00:00:45.629> can<00:00:45.750> plug<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.020> into<00:00:46.110> my<00:00:46.260> computer<00:00:46.320> or<00:00:46.860> or

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
we can plug it into my computer or or

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.819 
we can plug it into my computer or or
wheels<00:00:47.850> computer<00:00:48.270> or<00:00:48.390> jacks<00:00:48.629> computer<00:00:49.020> so

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
wheels computer or jacks computer so

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:50.959 
wheels computer or jacks computer so
it's<00:00:49.980> just<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.190> little<00:00:50.370> more<00:00:50.460> flexible

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
it's just a little more flexible

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.970 
it's just a little more flexible
eventually<00:00:51.930> we<00:00:52.050> do<00:00:52.199> want<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.440> migrate<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.949> a

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
eventually we do want to migrate to a

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.770 
eventually we do want to migrate to a
more<00:00:53.219> robust<00:00:53.579> dedicated<00:00:54.120> network<00:00:54.480> attached

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
more robust dedicated network attached

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.529 
more robust dedicated network attached
storage<00:00:54.809> or<00:00:55.440> Nass<00:00:56.010> but<00:00:56.850> for<00:00:57.059> now<00:00:57.149> this<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.449> all

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
storage or Nass but for now this is all

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.810 
storage or Nass but for now this is all
we<00:00:57.690> need<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:58.079> with<00:00:58.739> this<00:00:58.829> new<00:00:58.890> drobo<00:00:59.489> we<00:00:59.670> can

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
we need so with this new drobo we can

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.060 
we need so with this new drobo we can
get<00:01:00.000> five<00:01:00.629> gigabits<00:01:01.170> per<00:01:01.230> second<00:01:01.680> transfer

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
get five gigabits per second transfer

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.179 
get five gigabits per second transfer
speed<00:01:02.309> with<00:01:02.550> little<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.120> no<00:01:03.149> work<00:01:03.860> but<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.070> get

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
speed with little to no work but to get

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.100 
speed with little to no work but to get
more<00:01:05.430> than<00:01:05.640> just<00:01:05.700> gigabit<00:01:06.479> networking<00:01:06.960> we're

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
more than just gigabit networking we're

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.469 
more than just gigabit networking we're
going<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.290> need<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.500> little<00:01:07.830> more<00:01:08.100> lot<00:01:08.790> crazy

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
going to need a little more lot crazy

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.690 
going to need a little more lot crazy
hardware<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:10.500> we<00:01:10.740> reached<00:01:11.010> out<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.220> sea<00:01:11.490> gate

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
hardware so we reached out to sea gate

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.429 
hardware so we reached out to sea gate
and<00:01:11.880> they<00:01:12.000> gave<00:01:12.150> us<00:01:12.330> these<00:01:12.540> drugs<00:01:12.869> for<00:01:13.049> our<00:01:13.170> use

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
and they gave us these drugs for our use

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.050 
and they gave us these drugs for our use
and<00:01:13.770> we<00:01:14.159> put<00:01:14.310> them<00:01:14.400> on<00:01:14.490> our<00:01:14.549> DRO<00:01:14.760> bar<00:01:14.939> already

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
and we put them on our DRO bar already

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.450 
and we put them on our DRO bar already
let's<00:01:15.479> get<00:01:15.630> rid<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:15.960> old<00:01:16.250> elbow<00:01:17.250> who

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
let's get rid of this old elbow who

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.210 
let's get rid of this old elbow who
needs<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:18.200> and<00:01:19.200> they're<00:01:19.470> not<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.799> fastest

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
needs that and they're not the fastest

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.560 
needs that and they're not the fastest
but<00:01:20.430> they<00:01:20.580> are<00:01:20.729> really<00:01:20.880> reliable<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.479> we

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
but they are really reliable and we

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.480 
but they are really reliable and we
trust<00:01:21.840> them<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.290> keep<00:01:22.710> our<00:01:22.799> data<00:01:22.979> safe<00:01:23.220> in<00:01:23.430> the

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
trust them to keep our data safe in the

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.429 
trust them to keep our data safe in the
long<00:01:23.640> run<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:24.060> those<00:01:24.689> are<00:01:24.720> pretty<00:01:24.869> awesome<00:01:24.990> and

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
long run so those are pretty awesome and

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.890 
long run so those are pretty awesome and
on<00:01:26.100> top<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.759> all<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.090> they<00:01:27.450> gave<00:01:27.570> us<00:01:27.720> two

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
on top of all that they gave us two

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.749 
on top of all that they gave us two
extras<00:01:28.409> as<00:01:28.560> well<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.979> give<00:01:29.130> away<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.549> guys

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
extras as well to give away to you guys

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.760 
extras as well to give away to you guys
that's<00:01:30.000> what<00:01:30.210> all<00:01:30.960> these<00:01:31.110> hard<00:01:31.290> drives<00:01:31.439> here

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
that's what all these hard drives here

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.660 
that's what all these hard drives here
so<00:01:32.759> in<00:01:33.509> addition<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.950> they<00:01:35.400> heard<00:01:35.520> how
