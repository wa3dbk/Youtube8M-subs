00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 Hello everyone, summer has come and so 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.660
 coincided so long ago without removing anything 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.030
 slavnikova 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.880
 so today we will cook 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.710
 homemade ice cream as always try 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.440
 make it as dietary as possible 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.210
 You understand that while with ice cream 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.250
 unlikely to make it 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.080
 low-calorie but still try 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.090
 today we take frozen fruit 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.359
 fresh can take can take any 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.520
 the content that you like with us 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.280
 the hands were called fruit so we 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.610
 take then take 200 grams 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:42.000
 low-fat yogurt without taste and 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.690
 2 eggs went to start we need 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.270
 will separate the yolks from the whites and whip 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.640
 yolks night usually makes a couple 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.170
 yolks throw out but today yes there 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.170
 it will be possible to leave the yolks 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:10.979
 now we pour in here our offended yoga and 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.979
 whisk whisk well again 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:22.420
 now we have to chop the berries and 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:24.580
 mix them with ice cream base for 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.069
 We will use a blender but 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.530
 if you don't have a blender you can 

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:32.880
 use a mixer or even mix 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.880
 slime offense by the same whisk 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.289
 now we have to pour our 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.850
 ice cream in molds and put it 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.850
 freezer for at least 3 hours 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.350
 Here we have this say right away 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.240
 what we would put it would ask and 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.980
 differ from god more because 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.020
 the weather was great and we went for a walk and 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.750
 it was our mistake because she 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.430
 turned into ice and eat it pretty 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.220
 difficult therefore had to work in 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.160
 little cloud to breakthrough here such a product 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.880
 so we put it in the freezer about 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:36.760
 dickies 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:39.280
 no more ice to load now 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.470
