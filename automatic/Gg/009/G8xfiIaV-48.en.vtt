00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.960
 the Roman Empire went down that 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.630
 Ottoman Empire has gone down 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.800
 Austria hungary has perished 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.110
 they are all gone 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.430
 this european project is ours 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.960
 been forced 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.029
 By the way, if I have one 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.310
 I speak imperium then I think so 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.829
 not from Mr Barroso himself 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.419
 the eu has called it imperium 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:26.519
 So it's what they bring about 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.380
 try telling us about this 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.689
 imperium is a project 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.790
 for peace and prosperity what you us 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.410
 Do not tell the fact that it is 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.120
 in this project in reality um 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.309
 the personal gain of one 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.570
 small elite does that's the truth 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.359
 who are behind this project 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.059
 expel the inhuman politics of 

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:47.100
 financial oligarchy aims and that 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.829
 modern robe can not hide us 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.649
 that we in the 21st century the 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:56.100
 humiliation and suffocation of greece 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.019
 Ireland's Italy and Spain are experiencing it 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.359
 yes, there are many critics of the eu this 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:03.610
 is always becoming more centralistic 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.490
 dictatorial too and that in the end 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.470
 appeals also riots or rebellious 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.120
 against this form of the eu and against it 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.700
 form of europe battered 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.290
 impossible to be shot again 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.600
 I can recall the Lisbon Treaty 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.030
 and death shot at riot in this 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.410
 this institution lacks any kind 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.050
 democratic legitimation 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.600
 It is a big fight of the led 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.290
 will be the culture of Europe and the 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.850
 eu is not undemocratic but 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.130
 they do not believe that anti-democratic 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.680
 who just wants to tell them because it is 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.590
 there is a european parliament 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.479
 this project is democratic it is not 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.729
 demographically it is our big one 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.920
 fight for historical task 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.619
 our nations fight for ours 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.660
 to fight for our democracy 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.619
 children and grandchildren as free people 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.619
 can grow up
