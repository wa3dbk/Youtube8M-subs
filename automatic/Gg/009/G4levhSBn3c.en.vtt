00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 Hello dear friends, swami 

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:09.840
 marakasi you watch the transfer the best 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:12.150
 tanks for pumping part 2 and 1 tank 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.410
 who would like to recommend it to you 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:19.470
 Of course on four 25 tons very fun 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.570
 the car I pumped it for a long time she 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.260
 underwent many changes 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:28.289
 but nevertheless on batchate still 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.449
 very fun and interesting to carry out the fight 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.180
 and what makes this tanchik so 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.850
 cool but firstly the maximum 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.149
 speed of 65 kilometers per hour while 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.530
 she is recruited pretty quickly 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:43.530
 the only thing is that the speed of turning the chassis 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.780
 not the best among eats and but in 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.379
 in most cases it is enough 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.570
 there is also a very powerful gun which 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.469
 allows you to enter into the enemy with 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:59.039
 drum of 5 shells 1950 damage 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:02.059
 that is, theoretically we can take st 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.650
 Level 10 if we are lucky with homework 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.840
 of course this gun has a lot 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.510
 shortcomings for example for a long time 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.060
 details large scatter until long 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.850
 reload but still drum 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.369
 does its thing if you can 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.340
 paint almost every shell then you 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.040
 can do a lot of damage 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.570
 and of course this is the main 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.600
 complexity 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.790
 keep track of timing 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.490
 a place where you can ride out your 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.979
 long recharge 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:38.299
 plan in general tactics and that's it 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.500
 certainly not very easy but very 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.360
 interesting 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.790
 Naturally our French friend has 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.990
 cardboard armor that punch 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.899
 everything 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.220
 even a light tank can punish our 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:55.560
 frenchman but there is a little trick 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.140
 thanks to a good armor slope often 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.439
 It happens ricochets well and also costs 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.920
 note that there are some unreal 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:08.039
 penetration and hitting the caterpillar what 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.879
 very often saves our cardboard 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.489
 Frenchman 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.470
 Of the minuses worth noting bad angles 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.170
 vertical pickup model 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.100
 and a margin of safety is a small amount 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.190
 shells 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.020
 poor stabilization on the go and all this 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.530
 makes butt and not so simple 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:28.320
 tank as many say but nonetheless 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.140
 if you can plan an action in 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:34.800
 battle if you play drum well 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.590
 tanks know how to choose the right moment 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:41.520
 for attack you know when it is better to fall on 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.620
 reload it butt for sure you 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.320
 be able to bend and receive on it 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.260
 pleasure further i will tell you 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:52.080
 It is difficult to get to batchat and on the seventh 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.270
 level we have them x 13 75 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.660
 rather complicated tank because its 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.720
 often throws down the list to the same 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.340
 characteristics he is not the most outstanding 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.850
 at the eighth level we have a car 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.550
 more serious then mx 1390 to me personally this 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.340
 the tank really liked him quite 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:14.940
 but nevertheless often throws it 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.850
 out of the list in the top ten where to play just 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.570
 unbearably well and at the ninth level we 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:24.810
 lorraine is located 40 tons very 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.560
 complex tank big size good 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.880
 speed 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:33.840
 drum but cardboard armor and therefore 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:36.300
 play well just extremely complicated and i 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.610
 I think that pumping batch this whole 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.890
 test for you will you have to 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:44.070
 use your skill to the maximum 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:48.720
 but you play pillows on light tanks 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:51.500
 and end up with a great medium tank 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.940
 which you will surely like 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:57.450
 the next tank from ray would like you 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:00.420
 recommend this 121 for sure my choice 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.820
 surprise and really this tank 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.280
 not yet gained popularity 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.709
 but personally I liked him very much 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.650
 played on the test and also on the account 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.730
 friend and immediately me this tank 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.030
 liked 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:19.019
 and what is good in it but of course 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:21.750
 this is an alpha strike 440 damage charge 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.760
 the enemy is generally just a buzz guys 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.610
 I also liked the fact that here 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.349
 the main type of shells is armor-piercing 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.960
 and it's very good because they have 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:33.960
 better normalization plus there is 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.389
 excellent break through 258 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.180
 well really worth noting that speed 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:41.400
 projectile flight is not very high that 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.250
 It concerns me personally 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:48.120
 liked for such a weapon very much 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:50.879
 decent but there is of course one drawback 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.490
 which surely many will not like 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:56.340
 I say of course the corners are vertical 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.879
 the tips of this tank are just awful 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.289
 and the first time was extremely uncomfortable 

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:04.439
 even though I played a lot on 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:06.960
 Chinese tanks but no less then 

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:09.509
 somehow get used to it and if 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.990
 correctly choose the position then this 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:15.289
 the disadvantage is leveled also from the pros 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:18.750
 It is worth noting that good speed 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:22.020
 top speed 56 kilometers per hour true 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.060
 speed dialing is not the best and good 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.300
 maneuverability 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:30.330
 10 chassis turning speed of this just 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:33.210
 excellent armor 121 is quite strong and how 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.129
 for an average tank 120 millimeters forehead 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.529
 corps under a good slope 

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:40.379
 really worth noting that sometimes a tank 

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:42.029
 lights up if it hits 240 

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:45.449
 millimeters forehead towers 

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:47.759
 very well armored tower can she 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:49.589
 tank but the truth is very much in the way 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:52.409
 bad vertical alignment angles 

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:55.560
 especially on uneven terrain 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:58.889
 Well sometimes pierce the tower is not revenue 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:02.060
 quite large but if you move them 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:04.740
 and not so easy to heal the whole 121 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:08.069
 specific tank that is definitely not for everyone 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:10.379
 will like if you are annoyed by bad 

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:13.620
 vertical alignment angles, then you better 

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:16.139
 get around this tank country but if you this 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:20.099
 Don't be scared and you like big alpha 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:23.310
 then it is your choice of pumping 121 is not so 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:26.700
 too easy but simple let's start 7 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:28.800
 down t-34 one very good tank me 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:33.090
 personally enjoyed it 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.570
 passed and do not regret then we go t-34 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.510
 2 

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:39.180
 I'm active in this tank right now 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:41.840
 In principle, he is not bad but not to say 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:44.550
 so far we don't really like it 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.980
 I think that without any problems you can 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:49.080
 his pass and at the ninth level we 

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:51.480
 located in z120 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:54.060
 not even very bad tank true and 

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:57.120
 he didn’t play so many battles 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:59.820
 battles that I had they very much 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:02.730
 interesting and on this all friends thanks 

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:04.650
 great that you looked hopefully given 

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:06.890
 video you liked do not forget 

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:10.020
 subscribe to the channel and like 

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:12.060
 I wish you all the best with you 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:14.540
 was marakasi see you soon friends 

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.540
 until
