00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
abed so I'm going to have to use their

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.929 
abed so I'm going to have to use their
table<00:01:03.589> that<00:01:04.589> way<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:04.830> have<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.220> have<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.400> facade

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
table that way I have to have a facade

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.789 
table that way I have to have a facade
on<00:01:06.180> top<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.720> table<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.170> not<00:01:07.320> around<00:01:07.439> the

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
on top of the table and not around the

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.340 
on top of the table and not around the
table<00:01:08.390> also<00:01:09.390> another<00:01:09.570> reason<00:01:09.780> why<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.049> have<00:01:10.320> a

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
table also another reason why I have a

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.260 
table also another reason why I have a
facade<00:01:10.830> on<00:01:11.010> top<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.430> table<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:11.939> because<00:01:12.240> I

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
facade on top of the table is because I

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.499 
facade on top of the table is because I
have<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.510> nice<00:01:12.750> subwoofer<00:01:13.820> JBL<00:01:14.820> sub<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.450> I'd

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
have a nice subwoofer JBL sub that I'd

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.920 
have a nice subwoofer JBL sub that I'd
like<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.750> put<00:01:15.960> underneath<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.470> table<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.930> I

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
like to put underneath the table and I

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.080 
like to put underneath the table and I
know<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.590> can<00:01:19.770> still<00:01:20.040> put<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.400> facade<00:01:20.729> in<00:01:20.909> front

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
know you can still put a facade in front

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.600 
know you can still put a facade in front
of<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.270> sub<00:01:21.540> but<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:22.140> just<00:01:22.860> like<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.070> look<00:01:23.220> at<00:01:23.520> the

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
of a sub but I just like to look at the

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.539 
of a sub but I just like to look at the
sub<00:01:23.880> coming<00:01:24.479> through<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.869> skirt<00:01:25.229> lit<00:01:26.130> up<00:01:26.280> and

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
sub coming through the skirt lit up and

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.880 
sub coming through the skirt lit up and
then<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.090> facade<00:01:27.479> on<00:01:27.689> top<00:01:27.990> it's<00:01:28.320> just<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.650> nice

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
then the facade on top it's just a nice

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.700 
then the facade on top it's just a nice
little<00:01:29.130> touch<00:01:29.460> for<00:01:29.490> me<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.090> personally<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.900> like

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
little touch for me so personally I like

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.830 
little touch for me so personally I like
the<00:01:32.070> facade<00:01:32.460> on<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.729> table<00:01:33.150> just<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.689> be

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
the facade on the table just to be

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.990 
the facade on the table just to be
different<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.409> also<00:01:34.590> for<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.640> uniqueness

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
different and also for the uniqueness

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.690 
different and also for the uniqueness
and<00:01:36.479> then<00:01:36.720> also<00:01:36.930> because<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.799> events<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.250> do<00:01:38.310> I

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
and then also because the events I do I

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.630 
and then also because the events I do I
usually<00:01:39.509> have<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.780> use<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:39.990> table<00:01:40.560> alright<00:01:41.400> guys

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640

this is it
that's<00:01:44.220> my<00:01:44.460> setup<00:01:44.729> right<00:01:45.030> there<00:01:45.390> that's<00:01:46.290> my

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
that's my setup right there that's my

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.030 
that's my setup right there that's my
table

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
table

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.210 
table
that's<00:01:47.880> my<00:01:48.149> sub<00:01:48.500> underneath<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.619> table<00:01:50.040> and

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
that's my sub underneath the table and

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.609 
that's my sub underneath the table and
that's<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.420> facade<00:01:51.810> right<00:01:52.140> there

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
that's the facade right there

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.249 
that's the facade right there
like<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:52.950> said<00:01:53.009> this<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.460> table<00:01:53.939> facade<00:01:54.299> not<00:01:54.630> a

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
like I said this is a table facade not a

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.520 
like I said this is a table facade not a
not<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.740> floor<00:01:56.100> facade<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:56.549> I<00:01:57.240> wanted<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.200> do<00:01:58.380> it

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
not a floor facade so I wanted to do it

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.280 
not a floor facade so I wanted to do it
just<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.740> be<00:01:58.920> unique<00:01:59.509> now<00:02:00.509> as<00:02:00.750> far<00:02:01.020> as<00:02:01.079> the

effect and all he basically did was he
made<00:02:14.600> the<00:02:14.750> frames<00:02:16.480> then<00:02:17.480> he<00:02:17.630> put<00:02:17.810> these<00:02:17.930> nice

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
made the frames then he put these nice

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.770 
made the frames then he put these nice
little<00:02:18.380> hinges<00:02:18.860> on<00:02:19.069> them<00:02:19.220> and<00:02:19.430> then<00:02:20.270> we<00:02:20.480> used

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
little hinges on them and then we used

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.710 
little hinges on them and then we used
this<00:02:21.560> right<00:02:21.800> here<00:02:22.130> is<00:02:22.310> a<00:02:22.340> white<00:02:22.700> lycra<00:02:23.420> like<00:02:23.690> a

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
this right here is a white lycra like a

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.840 
this right here is a white lycra like a
spandex<00:02:24.550> so<00:02:25.550> if<00:02:25.640> you<00:02:25.730> look<00:02:25.850> around<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.180> back

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
spandex so if you look around the back

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.900 
spandex so if you look around the back
what<00:02:28.850> he<00:02:28.940> did<00:02:29.180> was<00:02:29.920> he<00:02:30.920> shaped<00:02:31.280> it<00:02:31.490> and<00:02:31.670> then<00:02:31.790> he

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
what he did was he shaped it and then he

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.940 
what he did was he shaped it and then he
just<00:02:32.090> stapled<00:02:32.630> it<00:02:32.690> all<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:32.990> way<00:02:33.110> down<00:02:33.350> and

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
just stapled it all the way down and

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.430 
just stapled it all the way down and
then<00:02:34.670> all<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:34.880> way<00:02:35.000> across<00:02:35.300> and<00:02:35.690> then<00:02:35.780> he<00:02:36.230> just

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
then all the way across and then he just

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.640 
then all the way across and then he just
cut<00:02:36.709> it<00:02:36.860> so<00:02:37.700> it<00:02:37.760> looks<00:02:37.910> like<00:02:38.060> a<00:02:38.090> straight<00:02:38.450> line

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
cut it so it looks like a straight line

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.640 
cut it so it looks like a straight line
so<00:02:39.650> if<00:02:39.770> you<00:02:39.860> stand<00:02:40.069> back<00:02:40.340> and<00:02:40.550> look<00:02:40.700> at<00:02:40.910> it

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
so if you stand back and look at it

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.840 
so if you stand back and look at it
looks<00:02:42.650> like<00:02:42.830> a<00:02:42.860> straight<00:02:43.220> line<00:02:43.400> all<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:43.730> way

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
looks like a straight line all the way

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.680 
looks like a straight line all the way
across<00:02:45.550> so<00:02:46.550> it<00:02:46.610> looks<00:02:46.790> nice<00:02:47.000> and<00:02:47.030> tight<00:02:47.420> nice

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
across so it looks nice and tight nice

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.860 
across so it looks nice and tight nice
and<00:02:47.930> neat<00:02:49.000> like<00:02:50.000> I<00:02:50.090> said<00:02:50.269> this<00:02:50.390> is<00:02:50.570> a<00:02:50.600> white

and<00:04:08.200> like<00:04:08.770> she<00:04:09.100> got<00:04:09.280> the<00:04:09.430> sub<00:04:09.670> on<00:04:09.820> the<00:04:09.910> bottom

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
and like she got the sub on the bottom

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.510 
and like she got the sub on the bottom
with<00:04:10.390> the<00:04:10.420> light<00:04:10.980> and<00:04:11.980> I<00:04:12.130> think<00:04:12.340> it<00:04:12.430> looks

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 
with the light and I think it looks

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.030 
with the light and I think it looks
pretty<00:04:12.700> cool<00:04:13.170> and<00:04:14.170> like<00:04:14.530> I<00:04:14.620> said<00:04:14.680> it's<00:04:14.980> a

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
pretty cool and like I said it's a

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.820 
pretty cool and like I said it's a
little<00:04:15.250> bit<00:04:15.340> different<00:04:15.580> it's<00:04:16.390> not<00:04:16.600> a<00:04:16.830> facade

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:17.830 
little bit different it's not a facade

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:19.530 
little bit different it's not a facade
that<00:04:18.100> goes<00:04:18.459> all<00:04:18.610> the<00:04:18.640> way<00:04:18.730> to<00:04:18.850> the<00:04:19.000> ground<00:04:19.209> it's

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.990 
that goes all the way to the ground it's

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
on top of a table but it works for me so

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.440 
on top of a table but it works for me so
