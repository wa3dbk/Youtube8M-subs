around for me to tinker with I've got

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.170 
around for me to tinker with I've got
some<00:02:38.129> mechanical<00:02:38.519> upgrades<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:39.150> do<00:02:39.329> on<00:02:39.510> it<00:02:41.180> but

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
some mechanical upgrades to do on it but

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.860 
some mechanical upgrades to do on it but
really<00:02:42.480> for<00:02:43.400> paint<00:02:44.400> that<00:02:44.639> it<00:02:44.730> is<00:02:44.879> and<00:02:45.269> the<00:02:45.719> age

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.080 
you can see the how much gloss and
clarity<00:02:53.790> this<00:02:54.000> does<00:02:54.209> have<00:02:54.950> so<00:02:55.950> I'm<00:02:56.310> pretty

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
clarity this does have so I'm pretty

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.849

on that replaced the badging
I've<00:04:21.850> got<00:04:22.090> a<00:04:22.120> crack<00:04:22.450> here<00:04:22.750> on<00:04:22.990> the<00:04:23.140> body<00:04:23.350> kit

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
I've got a crack here on the body kit

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.050 
I've got a crack here on the body kit
from<00:04:24.070> where<00:04:24.310> I'm<00:04:24.520> not<00:04:24.640> sure<00:04:24.700> where<00:04:24.940> it's

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
from where I'm not sure where it's

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.370 
from where I'm not sure where it's
coming<00:04:25.120> from<00:04:25.330> but<00:04:25.630> it's<00:04:25.780> cracking<00:04:26.200> just

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
coming from but it's cracking just

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.290 
coming from but it's cracking just
around<00:04:26.650> here<00:04:26.980> I<00:04:27.190> just<00:04:27.340> zoom<00:04:27.760> in<00:04:27.910> a<00:04:28.000> bit

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
around here I just zoom in a bit

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:35.090 
around here I just zoom in a bit
oops<00:04:30.030> just<00:04:31.030> see<00:04:31.150> that<00:04:31.300> little<00:04:31.510> crack<00:04:31.840> in<00:04:32.020> there

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:41.460 

right<00:04:36.100> here<00:04:38.250> but<00:04:39.300> look<00:04:40.300> for<00:04:40.720> a<00:04:40.780> car<00:04:41.050> of<00:04:41.080> at<00:04:41.260> age

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
right here but look for a car of at age

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.950 
right here but look for a car of at age
I<00:04:41.920> think<00:04:42.700> I'm<00:04:42.940> doing<00:04:43.120> right<00:04:43.270> now<00:04:43.450> the<00:04:43.510> inside

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
I think I'm doing right now the inside

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.850 
I think I'm doing right now the inside
is<00:04:44.200> much<00:04:44.380> better<00:04:45.990> now<00:04:46.990> this<00:04:47.170> car<00:04:47.410> we're<00:04:47.650> doing

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
is much better now this car we're doing

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.130 
is much better now this car we're doing
quite<00:04:48.040> a<00:04:48.100> few<00:04:48.190> demos<00:04:48.670> with<00:04:48.940> using<00:04:49.870> the<00:04:49.960> stuff

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 
quite a few demos with using the stuff

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.970 
quite a few demos with using the stuff
like<00:04:50.320> the<00:04:50.440> dueling<00:04:50.800> polish<00:04:52.380> the<00:04:53.380> high<00:04:53.590> tech

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
like the dueling polish the high tech

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.070 
like the dueling polish the high tech
because<00:04:54.760> I'll<00:04:55.000> be<00:04:55.120> able<00:04:55.210> to<00:04:55.360> polish<00:04:55.570> this<00:04:55.840> car

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
because I'll be able to polish this car

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.560 
because I'll be able to polish this car
for<00:04:56.260> a<00:04:56.320> long<00:04:56.470> time<00:04:56.850> with<00:04:57.850> those<00:04:58.000> two<00:04:58.210> products

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
for a long time with those two products

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.570 
for a long time with those two products
because<00:04:58.840> they<00:04:58.960> I<00:04:59.290> can<00:04:59.740> do<00:04:59.890> it<00:05:00.010> with<00:05:00.160> such<00:05:00.310> a<00:05:00.340> tip

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
because they I can do it with such a tip

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.040 
because they I can do it with such a tip
with<00:05:00.730> a<00:05:00.760> certain<00:05:01.090> technique<00:05:01.390> to<00:05:01.540> allow<00:05:01.630> that

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
with a certain technique to allow that

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.110 
with a certain technique to allow that
you<00:05:02.230> don't<00:05:02.410> really<00:05:02.590> remove<00:05:02.890> any<00:05:03.100> paint<00:05:03.430> you'd

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
you don't really remove any paint you'd

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.940 
you don't really remove any paint you'd
be<00:05:04.240> lucky<00:05:04.360> to<00:05:04.540> remove<00:05:04.900> point<00:05:05.200> one<00:05:05.320> of<00:05:05.440> a<00:05:05.500> micron

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
be lucky to remove point one of a micron

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.520 
be lucky to remove point one of a micron
or<00:05:06.130> half<00:05:06.370> a<00:05:06.490> micron<00:05:06.940> so<00:05:07.900> you're<00:05:08.140> not<00:05:08.260> removing

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
or half a micron so you're not removing

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.520 
or half a micron so you're not removing
much<00:05:09.210> so<00:05:10.210> the<00:05:10.270> interior<00:05:10.570> is<00:05:10.810> in<00:05:10.930> good<00:05:11.110> Nick<00:05:11.260> but

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
much so the interior is in good Nick but

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.620 
much so the interior is in good Nick but
like<00:05:11.680> I<00:05:11.710> said<00:05:11.890> I'll<00:05:12.040> be<00:05:12.070> doing<00:05:12.630> some

like I said I'll be doing some

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.550 
like I said I'll be doing some
demonstrations<00:05:14.430> on<00:05:15.510> this<00:05:16.510> certain<00:05:17.320> places

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
demonstrations on this certain places

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.590 
demonstrations on this certain places
I'm<00:05:17.860> going<00:05:17.890> to<00:05:18.040> do<00:05:18.130> the<00:05:18.220> whole<00:05:18.430> this<00:05:19.000> recorder

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:06.040 
stuff but yeah I've got to get new

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.580 
stuff but yeah I've got to get new
wheels<00:06:06.280> for<00:06:06.520> the<00:06:06.580> car<00:06:06.790> too<00:06:07.170> because<00:06:08.170> those<00:06:08.380> are

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.590 
wheels for the car too because those are

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:16.970 
wheels for the car too because those are
pretty<00:06:10.290> got<00:06:11.290> a<00:06:11.320> Rashed<00:06:13.590> it's<00:06:14.590> hard<00:06:14.770> to<00:06:14.950> see

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:16.980 
pretty got a Rashed it's hard to see

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.890 
pretty got a Rashed it's hard to see
through<00:06:17.980> this<00:06:18.270> inside<00:06:19.270> this<00:06:19.390> car<00:06:19.630> it's<00:06:19.750> hard

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:19.900 
through this inside this car it's hard

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.260 
through this inside this car it's hard
to<00:06:20.020> see<00:06:20.170> the<00:06:20.320> gathers<00:06:20.650> sometimes<00:06:21.130> so<00:06:21.970> you<00:06:22.030> get

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.270 
to see the gathers sometimes so you get

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.460 
to see the gathers sometimes so you get
a<00:06:22.300> bit<00:06:22.450> of<00:06:22.480> scrapers<00:06:22.930> going<00:06:23.230> on<00:06:23.350> and

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:23.470 
a bit of scrapers going on and

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.890 
a bit of scrapers going on and
especially<00:06:23.620> since<00:06:24.010> the<00:06:24.340> the<00:06:25.120> wheel<00:06:25.330> comes<00:06:25.630> out

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:25.900 
especially since the the wheel comes out
