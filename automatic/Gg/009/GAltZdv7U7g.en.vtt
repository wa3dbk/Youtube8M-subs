00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
to get it right around three ounces with

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.719 
to get it right around three ounces with
the<00:01:39.900> batteries<00:01:40.290> we<00:01:40.920> basically<00:01:41.280> combine<00:01:41.549> two

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
the batteries we basically combine two

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.550 
the batteries we basically combine two
components<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:42.420> our<00:01:42.720> heat<00:01:42.899> sink<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.200> also<00:01:43.470> the

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
components so our heat sink is also the

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.560 
components so our heat sink is also the
battery<00:01:43.710> pack<00:01:44.070> so<00:01:44.579> usually<00:01:44.909> what<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.149> see<00:01:45.180> is

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
battery pack so usually what you see is

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.060 
battery pack so usually what you see is
the<00:01:45.960> heat<00:01:46.110> dissipation<00:01:46.290> happens<00:01:46.920> from<00:01:47.040> a

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
the heat dissipation happens from a

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.469 
the heat dissipation happens from a
separate<00:01:47.490> component<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.060> then<00:01:48.390> the

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
separate component and then the

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.090 
separate component and then the
batteries<00:01:48.750> are<00:01:48.869> held<00:01:49.020> by<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.200> battery<00:01:49.530> pack<00:01:49.710> is

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
batteries are held by a battery pack is

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.560 
batteries are held by a battery pack is
they<00:01:50.220> we<00:01:50.340> combine<00:01:50.670> them<00:01:50.850> it's<00:01:51.180> all<00:01:51.360> metal

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
they we combine them it's all metal

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.050 
they we combine them it's all metal
construction<00:01:51.770> it's<00:01:52.770> all<00:01:52.920> aluminum<00:01:53.130> you'll

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
construction it's all aluminum you'll

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.300 
construction it's all aluminum you'll
see<00:01:54.210> here<00:01:54.590> there's<00:01:55.590> your<00:01:55.740> heat<00:01:55.860> sink<00:01:56.100> and

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
see here there's your heat sink and

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.219 
see here there's your heat sink and
that's<00:01:56.700> what<00:01:56.820> holds<00:01:56.939> your<00:01:57.060> batteries<00:01:57.450> right

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
that's what holds your batteries right

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.929 
that's what holds your batteries right
real<00:01:58.560> easy<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:58.860> do<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.070> visual<00:01:59.369> inspection<00:01:59.460> make

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
real easy to do a visual inspection make

mod okay so you can use whatever that
you<00:02:31.530> don't<00:02:31.680> get<00:02:31.830> a<00:02:31.890> mounting<00:02:32.280> option<00:02:32.640> with<00:02:32.790> it

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
you don't get a mounting option with it

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.930 
you don't get a mounting option with it
that's<00:02:33.450> up<00:02:33.630> to<00:02:33.660> you<00:02:34.010> you<00:02:35.010> can<00:02:35.100> so<00:02:35.520> everything

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
is actually just in this because I was

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.350 
is actually just in this because I was
initially<00:02:38.160> thinking<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.790> something<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.210> yeah

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
initially thinking to something and yeah

right yeah because you can see here the

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.760 
right yeah because you can see here the
keymod<00:02:45.210> option<00:02:45.660> this<00:02:46.320> is<00:02:46.380> kind<00:02:46.650> of<00:02:46.680> a

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
keymod option this is kind of a

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.920 
keymod option this is kind of a
Picatinny<00:02:47.130> rail<00:02:47.220> or<00:02:47.550> 45<00:02:47.970> right<00:02:48.240> this<00:02:48.750> is<00:02:48.870> a
