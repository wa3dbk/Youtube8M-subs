00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
engineers and actually they were really

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.020 
engineers and actually they were really
helpful<00:01:24.080> for<00:01:24.620> example<00:01:25.070> I<00:01:25.130> found<00:01:25.340> out<00:01:25.520> that<00:01:25.700> 40

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
helpful for example I found out that 40

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.400 
helpful for example I found out that 40
millimeters<00:01:26.480> is<00:01:26.600> going<00:01:26.720> to<00:01:26.780> work<00:01:26.960> best<00:01:27.200> but

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.410 
millimeters is going to work best but

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.230 
millimeters is going to work best but
you<00:01:27.530> can<00:01:27.680> go<00:01:27.830> maybe<00:01:28.070> up<00:01:28.340> to<00:01:28.550> like<00:01:28.730> 50

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
you can go maybe up to like 50

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.940 
you can go maybe up to like 50
millimeters<00:01:29.810> in<00:01:30.020> terms<00:01:30.230> of<00:01:30.440> focal<00:01:30.770> lengths

millimeters in terms of focal lengths

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.530 
millimeters in terms of focal lengths
you<00:01:31.460> can<00:01:31.580> also<00:01:31.700> go<00:01:31.880> a<00:01:31.910> little<00:01:32.060> shorter<00:01:32.390> but<00:01:32.480> I

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
you can also go a little shorter but I

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.090 
you can also go a little shorter but I
wouldn't<00:01:32.780> recommend<00:01:32.900> that<00:01:33.380> because<00:01:33.710> a<00:01:33.860> little

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
wouldn't recommend that because a little

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.290 
wouldn't recommend that because a little
bit<00:01:34.310> longer<00:01:34.490> is<00:01:34.640> gonna<00:01:34.760> work<00:01:34.880> better<00:01:35.120> than

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
bit longer is gonna work better than

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.360 
bit longer is gonna work better than
shorter<00:01:35.720> so<00:01:36.590> if<00:01:36.710> you<00:01:36.800> do<00:01:36.950> that<00:01:37.160> though<00:01:37.250> you're

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370 
shorter so if you do that though you're

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.130 
shorter so if you do that though you're
going<00:01:37.490> to<00:01:37.550> make<00:01:37.670> change<00:01:38.180> to<00:01:38.600> the<00:01:38.720> cardboard

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
going to make change to the cardboard

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.550 
going to make change to the cardboard
cut-out

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
cut-out

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.470 
cut-out
needs<00:01:40.190> to<00:01:40.310> be<00:01:40.400> a<00:01:40.430> longer<00:01:40.700> so<00:01:40.940> basically<00:01:41.270> the

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.480 
needs to be a longer so basically the

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.910 
needs to be a longer so basically the
focal<00:01:41.840> length<00:01:42.020> of<00:01:42.170> the<00:01:42.260> lens<00:01:42.470> has<00:01:42.680> to<00:01:42.770> match

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
focal length of the lens has to match

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.130 
focal length of the lens has to match
the<00:01:43.100> distance<00:01:43.310> of<00:01:43.610> the<00:01:43.700> lens<00:01:43.940> to<00:01:44.210> the<00:01:44.240> phone<00:01:44.540> if

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
the distance of the lens to the phone if

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.240 
the distance of the lens to the phone if
you're<00:01:45.290> still<00:01:45.500> having<00:01:45.650> trouble<00:01:45.800> finding

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
you're still having trouble finding

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.490 
you're still having trouble finding
lenses<00:01:46.610> you<00:01:47.300> can<00:01:47.420> experiment<00:01:47.870> going<00:01:48.140> a<00:01:48.290> little

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
lenses you can experiment going a little

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.200 
lenses you can experiment going a little
bit<00:01:48.800> wider<00:01:49.070> in<00:01:49.280> diameter<00:01:49.460> that's<00:01:49.880> not<00:01:50.090> going

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
bit wider in diameter that's not going

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.540 
bit wider in diameter that's not going
to<00:01:50.270> mess<00:01:50.390> you<00:01:50.540> up<00:01:50.600> too<00:01:50.810> much<00:01:51.020> or<00:01:51.380> you<00:01:51.980> can<00:01:52.130> try<00:01:52.340> a

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
to mess you up too much or you can try a

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.910 
to mess you up too much or you can try a
Plano<00:01:53.390> convex<00:01:53.660> lens<00:01:54.050> that<00:01:54.170> means<00:01:54.290> one<00:01:54.560> side<00:01:54.770> is

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
Plano convex lens that means one side is

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.160 
Plano convex lens that means one side is
flat<00:01:55.160> and<00:01:55.250> the<00:01:55.340> other<00:01:55.430> side<00:01:55.640> is<00:01:55.760> curved<00:01:56.170> I'm

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
flat and the other side is curved I'm

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.530 
flat and the other side is curved I'm
using<00:01:57.440> bio<00:01:57.800> convex<00:01:58.370> or<00:01:58.580> double<00:01:59.030> convex<00:01:59.390> which

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
using bio convex or double convex which

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.300 
using bio convex or double convex which
means<00:01:59.750> both<00:01:59.930> sides<00:02:00.170> are<00:02:00.409> curved<00:02:00.680> and<00:02:00.950> that's

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
means both sides are curved and that's

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.560 
means both sides are curved and that's
kind<00:02:01.490> of<00:02:01.520> what<00:02:01.670> Google<00:02:01.760> recommends<00:02:02.330> but<00:02:02.450> it

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
kind of what Google recommends but it

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:03.880 
kind of what Google recommends but it
probably<00:02:02.840> will<00:02:03.050> work<00:02:03.170> fine<00:02:03.470> with<00:02:03.500> the<00:02:03.650> plane

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
probably will work fine with the plane

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:04.469 
probably will work fine with the plane
okay

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
okay

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.749 
okay
