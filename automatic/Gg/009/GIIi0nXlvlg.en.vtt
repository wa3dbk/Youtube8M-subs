this sign and go up make sure this top

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.599 
this sign and go up make sure this top
part<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.659> coming<00:01:01.530> out<00:01:01.800> more<00:01:02.070> than<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.460> bottom

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
part is coming out more than the bottom

part is coming out more than the bottom
part<00:01:02.999> you<00:01:07.430> know<00:01:08.430> there's<00:01:08.670> an<00:01:08.880> extra<00:01:09.390> line<00:01:12.800> next

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 
part you know there's an extra line next

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.210 
part you know there's an extra line next
for<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.430> feet<00:01:15.410> four<00:01:16.410> feet<00:01:16.530> if<00:01:16.860> it's<00:01:17.040> gonna

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
for the feet four feet if it's gonna

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:44.300 
for the feet four feet if it's gonna
draw<00:01:17.610> two<00:01:18.540> parallel<00:01:18.810> lines

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.249 

this<00:01:45.310> back<00:01:45.549> leg<00:01:45.759> should<00:01:46.119> look<00:01:46.719> bent<00:01:47.079> a<00:01:47.229> little

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
this back leg should look bent a little

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:57.149 
this back leg should look bent a little
bit<00:01:53.340> okay<00:01:54.340> the<00:01:54.520> third<00:01:54.700> step<00:01:55.060> is<00:01:55.270> to<00:01:56.079> draw<00:01:56.319> so

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
bit okay the third step is to draw so

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.880 
bit okay the third step is to draw so
that<00:01:57.399> it's<00:01:57.909> the<00:01:58.299> same<00:01:58.509> exact<00:01:58.929> foot<00:01:59.289> but<00:01:59.530> sort

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
that it's the same exact foot but sort

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.940 
that it's the same exact foot but sort
of<00:02:00.009> move<00:02:00.159> back<00:02:00.369> up<00:02:01.380> shorter<00:02:02.380> than<00:02:02.590> the<00:02:02.829> other

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
of move back up shorter than the other

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:29.449 
of move back up shorter than the other
like<00:02:03.459> so<00:02:26.130> next<00:02:27.130> we're<00:02:27.400> gonna<00:02:27.519> draw<00:02:27.819> the<00:02:27.880> tail

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
like so next we're gonna draw the tail

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.000 
like so next we're gonna draw the tail
um<00:02:30.459> if<00:02:30.959> your<00:02:31.959> body<00:02:32.200> turned<00:02:32.560> out<00:02:32.709> to<00:02:32.860> be<00:02:32.980> a

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
um if your body turned out to be a

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.339 
um if your body turned out to be a
little<00:02:33.310> smaller<00:02:33.640> than<00:02:33.940> you<00:02:34.060> thought<00:02:34.349> just

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
little smaller than you thought just

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:41.880 
little smaller than you thought just
change<00:02:35.980> it<00:02:36.190> a<00:02:36.280> little<00:02:39.660> and<00:02:40.660> now<00:02:41.079> for<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.620> tail

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
change it a little and now for the tail

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:51.229 
change it a little and now for the tail
go<00:02:42.610> spin<00:02:42.880> it

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.910 

like<00:02:52.239> that<00:02:54.900> and<00:02:55.900> we're<00:02:56.080> gonna<00:02:56.230> drop<00:02:56.560> a

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
like that and we're gonna drop a

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.539 
like that and we're gonna drop a
connector<00:02:57.879> piece<00:02:58.120> in<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:58.540> head<00:02:58.750> and<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.650> body

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:13.860 

just<00:03:07.829> like<00:03:08.829> that<00:03:11.069> their<00:03:12.069> next<00:03:12.280> step<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:13.750> just

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
just like that their next step to just

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.839 
just like that their next step to just
dry<00:03:14.170> nose<00:03:14.470> just<00:03:14.860> like<00:03:14.980> a<00:03:15.069> little<00:03:15.370> square<00:03:15.700> in
