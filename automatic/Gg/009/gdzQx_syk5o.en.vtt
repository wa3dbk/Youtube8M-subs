so<00:00:00.690> it<00:00:00.810> looks<00:00:00.960> like<00:00:01.230> this<00:00:01.620> could<00:00:01.860> exempt<00:00:02.310> that

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
so it looks like this could exempt that

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.649 
so it looks like this could exempt that
they'd<00:00:02.610> like<00:00:02.790> to<00:00:02.820> ask<00:00:03.120> you<00:00:03.360> a<00:00:03.419> lot<00:00:03.600> of

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
they'd like to ask you a lot of

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.360 
they'd like to ask you a lot of
factoring<00:00:04.200> questions<00:00:04.680> and<00:00:04.920> how<00:00:05.069> to<00:00:05.130> simplify

rational<00:00:06.240> expressions<00:00:06.960> so<00:00:07.620> just<00:00:07.799> make<00:00:07.950> sure

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
rational expressions so just make sure

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.980 
rational expressions so just make sure
that<00:00:08.099> you<00:00:08.309> practice<00:00:08.519> enough<00:00:09.090> questions<00:00:09.660> and

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
that you practice enough questions and

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.680 
that you practice enough questions and
you<00:00:10.349> know<00:00:10.440> doing<00:00:10.920> the<00:00:11.010> factorings<00:00:11.509> work<00:00:12.509> with

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
you know doing the factorings work with

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.169 
you know doing the factorings work with
fractions<00:00:13.049> rational<00:00:14.040> expressions<00:00:14.639> since

that question 14 I have 9 minus x

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.070 
that question 14 I have 9 minus x
squared<00:00:18.900> over<00:00:19.350> X<00:00:20.039> minus<00:00:20.580> 3<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.630> see<00:00:21.840> which

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
squared over X minus 3 and to see which

don't<00:00:28.920> let<00:00:29.070> this<00:00:29.189> bother<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.609> too<00:00:29.910> much<00:00:30.170> okay

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
don't let this bother you too much okay

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.840 
don't let this bother you too much okay
whenever<00:00:31.890> they<00:00:32.130> say<00:00:32.279> something<00:00:32.489> like<00:00:32.669> this

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
whenever they say something like this

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.549 
whenever they say something like this
they<00:00:33.239> just<00:00:33.270> want<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.690> make<00:00:33.899> sure<00:00:33.930> that<00:00:34.230> this

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
they just want to make sure that this

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.430 
they just want to make sure that this
isn't<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:35.100> chat<00:00:35.309> question<00:00:36.260> for<00:00:37.260> example<00:00:38.989> if<00:00:39.989> X

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
isn't a chat question for example if X

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.520 
isn't a chat question for example if X
is<00:00:40.590> less<00:00:40.649> than<00:00:40.860> negative<00:00:41.129> 3<00:00:41.550> right<00:00:42.200> then<00:00:43.200> that

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
is less than negative 3 right then that

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.139 
is less than negative 3 right then that
will<00:00:43.739> make<00:00:43.980> sure<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.460> denominator<00:00:45.000> is

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
will make sure that the denominator is

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.270 
will make sure that the denominator is
not<00:00:45.210> equal<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.629> 0<00:00:45.960> right<00:00:46.440> because<00:00:46.500> X<00:00:46.980> has<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.250> be

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
not equal to 0 right because X has to be

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.369 
not equal to 0 right because X has to be
like<00:00:47.489> negative<00:00:48.120> 5<00:00:48.510> negative

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
like negative 5 negative

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.770 
like negative 5 negative
tense<00:00:49.739> inside<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.760> would<00:00:51.000> make<00:00:51.600> sure

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
tense inside that that would make sure

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.750 
tense inside that that would make sure
that<00:00:51.930> X<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.860> will<00:00:52.980> make<00:00:53.129> sure<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.460> in

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
that X that will make sure that that in

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.720 
that X that will make sure that that in
nominator<00:00:54.180> it's<00:00:54.480> now<00:00:54.690> resolved<00:00:55.170> 0<00:00:55.550> so<00:00:56.550> that's

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
nominator it's now resolved 0 so that's

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.910 
nominator it's now resolved 0 so that's
the<00:00:56.850> reason<00:00:57.030> why<00:00:57.289> but<00:00:58.289> don't<00:00:58.500> let<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.620> bother

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
the reason why but don't let that bother

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.799 
the reason why but don't let that bother
you<00:00:59.160> too<00:00:59.309> much<00:00:59.340> let<00:01:00.180> me<00:01:00.270> just<00:01:00.480> do<00:01:00.629> the

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
you too much let me just do the

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.170 
you too much let me just do the
simplification<00:01:01.140> okay<00:01:01.890> now<00:01:02.280> let<00:01:02.579> me<00:01:02.699> let's

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
simplification okay now let me let's

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.289 
simplification okay now let me let's
just<00:01:03.420> do<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.570> simplification<00:01:04.489> 9<00:01:05.489> minus<00:01:06.060> x

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
just do a simplification 9 minus x

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.300 
just do a simplification 9 minus x
squared<00:01:06.390> over<00:01:07.850> X<00:01:08.850> minus<00:01:09.420> 3<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.010> want<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.189> put

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
squared over X minus 3 so I want to put

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.050 
squared over X minus 3 so I want to put
on<00:01:11.400> some<00:01:11.549> notes<00:01:11.820> on<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.330> side<00:01:13.729> so<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.820> first

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
on some notes on the side so the first

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.410 
on some notes on the side so the first
thing<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.360> notice<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.259> top<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.770> have<00:01:16.920> 9<00:01:17.549> minus<00:01:18.150> x

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
thing is notice the top I have 9 minus x

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.170 
thing is notice the top I have 9 minus x
squared<00:01:18.979> and<00:01:19.979> isn't<00:01:20.340> in<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.580> case<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:20.820> we

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
squared and isn't in the case that we

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.070 
squared and isn't in the case that we
always<00:01:21.330> try<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.689> like<00:01:22.200> we<00:01:22.710> always<00:01:24.049> we<00:01:25.049> always

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
always try to like we always we always

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.679 
always try to like we always we always
like<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.560> have<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.580> X<00:01:26.790> in<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:26.970> front<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.540> then

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
like to have the X in the front and then

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.179 
like to have the X in the front and then
a<00:01:27.780> number<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.200> back<00:01:28.380> right

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
a number in the back right

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.719 
a number in the back right
so<00:01:30.000> sometimes<00:01:30.960> what's<00:01:31.950> inside<00:01:32.250> all<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.490> water

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
so sometimes what's inside all the water

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.990 
so sometimes what's inside all the water
just<00:01:33.090> like<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.869> then<00:01:34.590> means<00:01:34.740> radius<00:01:35.130> you

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
just like this and then means radius you

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.469 
just like this and then means radius you
felt<00:01:36.210> some<00:01:36.390> number<00:01:36.600> let's<00:01:36.780> say<00:01:36.869> B<00:01:37.500> minus<00:01:37.890> a

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
felt some number let's say B minus a

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.460 
felt some number let's say B minus a
it's<00:01:39.479> something<00:01:39.689> that's<00:01:39.990> kind<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.200> out<00:01:40.439> of

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
it's something that's kind of out of

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.920 
it's something that's kind of out of
water<00:01:40.950> we<00:01:41.820> can<00:01:41.850> actually<00:01:42.150> switch<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.750> water

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
water we can actually switch the water

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.399 
water we can actually switch the water
when<00:01:43.560> we<00:01:43.680> have<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:43.860> subtraction<00:01:44.570> so<00:01:45.570> instead<00:01:46.320> of

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
when we have a subtraction so instead of

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.770 
when we have a subtraction so instead of
B<00:01:46.560> minus<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.979> right<00:01:47.820> we're<00:01:48.390> going<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.630> write

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
B minus a right we're going to write

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.179 
B minus a right we're going to write
this<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:49.170> minus<00:01:50.009> B<00:01:50.189> this<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.180> okay<00:01:51.540> but<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.979> one

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
this a minus B this is okay but the one

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.679 
this a minus B this is okay but the one
more<00:01:53.399> one<00:01:53.880> more<00:01:53.909> thing<00:01:54.180> that<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.360> have<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.540> pay

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
more one more thing that you have to pay

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.230 
more one more thing that you have to pay
attention<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.110> this<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.890> need<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.210> put<00:01:57.210> a

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
attention to this you need to put a

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.730 
attention to this you need to put a
negative<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.780> then<00:01:58.369> parentheses<00:01:59.369> around<00:01:59.520> it

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
negative and then parentheses around it

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.109 
negative and then parentheses around it
if<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.920> switch<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.250> order<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.729> subtraction

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
if you switch the order of subtraction

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.690 
if you switch the order of subtraction
that's<00:02:03.719> okay<00:02:04.140> but<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.799> result<00:02:05.219> will<00:02:05.579> be<00:02:05.610> a

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
that's okay but the result will be a

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.479 
that's okay but the result will be a
negative<00:02:06.259> okay<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:07.649> that's<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.950> first<00:02:07.979> note

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
negative okay so that's the first note

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.750 
negative okay so that's the first note
that<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:08.759> want<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.060> point<00:02:09.239> you<00:02:09.360> out<00:02:09.649> so<00:02:10.649> on<00:02:11.009> the

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
that I want to point you out so on the

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.950 
that I want to point you out so on the
top<00:02:12.000> as<00:02:12.629> I<00:02:12.870> can<00:02:13.020> see<00:02:13.200> that

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
top as I can see that

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.470 
top as I can see that
-<00:02:14.260> x<00:02:14.440> squared<00:02:14.560> I<00:02:14.950> don't<00:02:15.280> like<00:02:15.400> that<00:02:15.550> I<00:02:15.820> want<00:02:16.390> to

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
- x squared I don't like that I want to

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.160 
- x squared I don't like that I want to
have<00:02:16.630> x<00:02:16.990> squared<00:02:17.200> minus<00:02:18.070> 9<00:02:18.330> that's<00:02:19.330> totally<00:02:19.900> ok

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
have x squared minus 9 that's totally ok

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.320 
have x squared minus 9 that's totally ok
but<00:02:20.800> you<00:02:21.190> need<00:02:21.370> to<00:02:21.460> make<00:02:21.580> sure<00:02:21.760> that<00:02:21.940> the

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
but you need to make sure that the

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.370 
but you need to make sure that the
result<00:02:22.780> is<00:02:23.020> negative<00:02:24.930> so<00:02:25.930> that's<00:02:26.020> my<00:02:26.230> first

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
result is negative so that's my first

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.880 
result is negative so that's my first
step

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
step

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.220 
step
that's<00:02:27.640> my<00:02:27.790> first<00:02:28.000> step<00:02:30.660> button<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:31.990> then<00:02:32.110> the

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
that's my first step button and then the

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.530 
that's my first step button and then the
second<00:02:32.530> step<00:02:32.680> on<00:02:33.220> this<00:02:33.460> question<00:02:33.700> similar<00:02:34.180> to

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
second step on this question similar to

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.260 
second step on this question similar to
question<00:02:34.990> number<00:02:35.200> 13<00:02:35.670> when<00:02:36.670> you<00:02:36.850> see<00:02:37.060> how<00:02:37.210> to

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
question number 13 when you see how to

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.840 
question number 13 when you see how to
factor<00:02:37.570> out<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:37.900> top<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:39.400> button<00:02:39.550> there's

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
factor out the top the button there's

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.000 
factor out the top the button there's
not<00:02:40.030> much<00:02:40.270> that<00:02:40.300> we<00:02:40.510> can<00:02:40.630> do<00:02:40.780> right<00:02:41.200> so<00:02:41.440> to

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
not much that we can do right so to

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.790 
not much that we can do right so to
factor<00:02:42.280> out<00:02:42.550> x<00:02:42.820> squared<00:02:43.180> -<00:02:43.570> 9<00:02:43.810> -<00:02:44.560> term

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
factor out x squared - 9 - term

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.920 
factor out x squared - 9 - term
factorings<00:02:45.310> and<00:02:46.120> this<00:02:46.360> is<00:02:46.510> actually<00:02:46.900> a

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
factorings and this is actually a

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.380 
factorings and this is actually a
perfect<00:02:47.230> this<00:02:48.070> is<00:02:48.280> actually<00:02:48.670> a<00:02:48.700> difference<00:02:49.270> of

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
perfect this is actually a difference of

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.830 
perfect this is actually a difference of
two<00:02:49.600> squares<00:02:49.860> so<00:02:50.860> if<00:02:51.760> you<00:02:51.880> have<00:02:51.970> a<00:02:52.150> squared

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
two squares so if you have a squared

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.830 
two squares so if you have a squared
minus<00:02:53.350> B<00:02:53.650> squared<00:02:53.680> I<00:02:54.250> can<00:02:54.850> write<00:02:55.240> this<00:02:55.360> as<00:02:55.600> a

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
minus B squared I can write this as a

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.470 
minus B squared I can write this as a
plus<00:02:56.620> B<00:02:57.030> times<00:02:58.030> a<00:02:58.450> minus<00:02:58.660> B<00:03:00.150> this<00:03:01.150> is<00:03:01.330> the

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
plus B times a minus B this is the

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.840 
plus B times a minus B this is the
factoring<00:03:01.990> for<00:03:02.320> the<00:03:02.800> difference<00:03:03.400> of<00:03:03.610> two

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
factoring for the difference of two

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.070 
factoring for the difference of two
squares<00:03:03.880> and<00:03:06.270> they<00:03:07.270> mean<00:03:07.390> choose<00:03:07.630> properly

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
squares and they mean choose properly

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.140 
squares and they mean choose properly
write<00:03:08.290> it<00:03:08.410> down<00:03:08.470> right<00:03:08.620> here<00:03:08.880> for<00:03:09.880> this<00:03:10.030> one

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
write it down right here for this one

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.710 
write it down right here for this one
right<00:03:10.240> here<00:03:10.740> so<00:03:11.740> if<00:03:11.980> you<00:03:12.070> have<00:03:12.160> x<00:03:12.430> squared

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
right here so if you have x squared

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.700 
right here so if you have x squared
minus<00:03:13.720> 9<00:03:14.310> we<00:03:15.310> can<00:03:15.340> look<00:03:15.610> at<00:03:15.700> this<00:03:15.850> yes<00:03:16.060> I<00:03:16.390> have<00:03:17.050> X

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:17.710 
minus 9 we can look at this yes I have X

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:23.070 
minus 9 we can look at this yes I have X
square<00:03:18.580> and<00:03:19.450> then<00:03:20.110> -<00:03:20.650> I<00:03:20.890> can<00:03:21.640> write<00:03:21.820> a<00:03:21.850> nice<00:03:22.120> 3

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
square and then - I can write a nice 3

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.810 
square and then - I can write a nice 3
square<00:03:23.700> 3<00:03:24.700> square<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:26.470> as<00:03:27.220> you<00:03:27.340> can<00:03:27.460> see<00:03:27.520> that

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
square 3 square and as you can see that

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.690 
square 3 square and as you can see that
this<00:03:28.690> right<00:03:28.930> here<00:03:28.990> is<00:03:29.170> exactly<00:03:29.500> in<00:03:30.160> this<00:03:30.340> form

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
this right here is exactly in this form

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.110 
this right here is exactly in this form
in<00:03:31.570> this<00:03:31.720> format<00:03:32.170> so<00:03:32.440> I<00:03:33.310> can<00:03:33.460> just<00:03:33.640> do<00:03:33.760> the

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
in this format so I can just do the

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.380 
in this format so I can just do the
first<00:03:34.390> plus<00:03:35.020> the<00:03:35.230> second<00:03:35.620> times<00:03:36.280> the<00:03:36.670> first<00:03:37.000> -

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
first plus the second times the first -

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.830 
first plus the second times the first -
a<00:03:37.510> second<00:03:37.870> so<00:03:38.710> this<00:03:38.860> is<00:03:39.100> equal<00:03:39.460> to<00:03:39.690> okay

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
a second so this is equal to okay

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.540 
a second so this is equal to okay
X<00:03:41.490> plus<00:03:42.750> no<00:03:43.750> Street<00:03:44.680> I<00:03:44.890> want<00:03:45.130> to<00:03:45.190> make<00:03:45.310> sure<00:03:45.340> all

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
X plus no Street I want to make sure all

X plus no Street I want to make sure all
my<00:03:45.670> colors<00:03:46.030> is<00:03:46.180> correct<00:03:46.540> I<00:03:46.780> learn

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
my colors is correct I learn

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:54.120 
my colors is correct I learn
X<00:03:48.660> minus<00:03:49.920> 3<00:03:52.110> so<00:03:53.110> this<00:03:53.320> is<00:03:53.590> what's<00:03:53.860> going<00:03:54.070> to

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
X minus 3 so this is what's going to

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.610 
X minus 3 so this is what's going to
happen<00:03:54.520> this<00:03:55.330> is<00:03:55.390> going<00:03:55.570> this<00:03:56.020> is<00:03:56.170> how<00:03:56.200> we're

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
happen this is going this is how we're

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.740 
happen this is going this is how we're
going<00:03:56.770> to<00:03:56.860> factor<00:03:57.130> this<00:03:58.090> parenthesis<00:03:58.630> right

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
going to factor this parenthesis right

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.710 
going to factor this parenthesis right
here<00:03:58.930> x<00:03:59.350> squared<00:03:59.590> minus<00:04:00.100> 9<00:04:00.390> we<00:04:01.390> still<00:04:01.570> have<00:04:01.690> a

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
here x squared minus 9 we still have a

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.630 
here x squared minus 9 we still have a
negative<00:04:01.900> outside<00:04:02.440> so<00:04:03.040> then<00:04:03.190> we<00:04:03.280> carry<00:04:03.520> a

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
negative outside so then we carry a

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.050 
negative outside so then we carry a
negative<00:04:03.880> right<00:04:04.390> here<00:04:05.190> x<00:04:06.190> squared<00:04:06.550> minus<00:04:06.850> 9

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
negative right here x squared minus 9

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:14.820 
negative right here x squared minus 9
becomes<00:04:08.310> this<00:04:09.780> X<00:04:10.780> plus<00:04:11.170> 3<00:04:11.650> X<00:04:12.000> minus<00:04:13.000> 3<00:04:13.650> if<00:04:14.650> you

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
becomes this X plus 3 X minus 3 if you

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.530 
becomes this X plus 3 X minus 3 if you
wrong<00:04:15.010> if<00:04:15.220> you<00:04:15.430> want<00:04:15.610> to<00:04:15.700> write<00:04:15.880> X<00:04:16.090> minus<00:04:16.420> 3

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
wrong if you want to write X minus 3

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.539 
wrong if you want to write X minus 3
first<00:04:16.750> and<00:04:17.020> then<00:04:17.290> X<00:04:17.530> plus<00:04:17.739> 3<00:04:17.920> that's<00:04:18.220> totally

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
first and then X plus 3 that's totally

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.820 
first and then X plus 3 that's totally
fine<00:04:18.810> multiplication<00:04:19.810> doesn't<00:04:20.320> matter<00:04:20.590> the

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:20.830 
fine multiplication doesn't matter the

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:27.030 
fine multiplication doesn't matter the
water<00:04:22.650> over<00:04:23.650> up<00:04:24.010> at<00:04:24.310> bottom<00:04:24.760> X<00:04:25.120> minus<00:04:25.570> 3<00:04:25.810> and<00:04:26.169> I

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
water over up at bottom X minus 3 and I

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.720 
water over up at bottom X minus 3 and I
can<00:04:27.220> put<00:04:27.400> an

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
can put an

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.160 
can put an
first<00:04:27.910> of<00:04:28.030> all<00:04:28.090> parentheses<00:04:28.600> around<00:04:28.840> the<00:04:29.140> X

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170 
first of all parentheses around the X

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.280 
first of all parentheses around the X
minus<00:04:29.680> three<00:04:29.890> and<00:04:30.820> as<00:04:30.970> we<00:04:31.150> can<00:04:31.300> see<00:04:31.480> that<00:04:31.660> this

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
minus three and as we can see that this

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.620 
minus three and as we can see that this
MX<00:04:32.740> minus<00:04:33.070> two<00:04:33.190> on<00:04:33.370> top<00:04:33.550> and<00:04:34.030> this<00:04:34.240> X<00:04:34.480> minus

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
MX minus two on top and this X minus

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.360 
MX minus two on top and this X minus
three<00:04:34.990> on<00:04:35.110> the<00:04:35.200> bottom<00:04:35.320> they<00:04:35.830> are<00:04:35.920> exactly<00:04:36.280> the

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
three on the bottom they are exactly the

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.230 
three on the bottom they are exactly the
same<00:04:36.460> so<00:04:37.060> again<00:04:37.680> okay<00:04:38.680> so<00:04:38.740> cancel<00:04:39.190> and<00:04:39.580> then<00:04:40.060> I

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
same so again okay so cancel and then I

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.880 
same so again okay so cancel and then I
get<00:04:40.510> negative<00:04:40.960> parenthesis<00:04:41.470> X<00:04:42.340> plus<00:04:43.060> 3<00:04:43.710> over<00:04:44.710> 1

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
get negative parenthesis X plus 3 over 1

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.440 
get negative parenthesis X plus 3 over 1
which<00:04:45.100> is<00:04:45.160> just<00:04:45.370> this<00:04:45.940> by<00:04:46.090> itself

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
which is just this by itself

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.130 
which is just this by itself
and<00:04:46.930> let<00:04:47.140> me<00:04:47.230> see<00:04:47.380> it<00:04:47.470> that's<00:04:47.740> the<00:04:47.860> answer<00:04:49.140> well

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 
and let me see it that's the answer well

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.710 
and let me see it that's the answer well
it<00:04:51.010> looks<00:04:51.160> like<00:04:51.310> this<00:04:51.580> nothing<00:04:52.420> the<00:04:52.510> has<00:04:52.690> a

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
it looks like this nothing the has a

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.170 
it looks like this nothing the has a
parenthesis<00:04:53.290> for<00:04:53.530> the<00:04:53.620> answer<00:04:53.920> right<00:04:54.820> here<00:04:55.030> I

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
parenthesis for the answer right here I

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.080 
parenthesis for the answer right here I
have<00:04:55.390> negative<00:04:55.660> x<00:04:56.200> plus<00:04:56.500> 3<00:04:56.650> and<00:04:57.160> to<00:04:57.820> do<00:04:57.940> one

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
have negative x plus 3 and to do one

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.390 
have negative x plus 3 and to do one
more<00:04:58.240> steps<00:04:58.510> I<00:04:58.780> need<00:04:59.770> to<00:04:59.800> take<00:04:59.890> the<00:05:00.250> negative

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
more steps I need to take the negative

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.420 
more steps I need to take the negative
and<00:05:00.820> then<00:05:01.330> multiply<00:05:01.780> the<00:05:01.840> inside

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
and then multiply the inside

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.720 
and then multiply the inside
distributing<00:05:03.430> side<00:05:05.100> negative<00:05:06.100> times<00:05:06.250> X<00:05:06.520> is

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:06.730 
distributing side negative times X is

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.270 
distributing side negative times X is
negative<00:05:06.790> x<00:05:07.480> negative<00:05:08.200> times<00:05:08.650> positive<00:05:08.770> 3

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
negative x negative times positive 3

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.740 
negative x negative times positive 3
negative<00:05:09.540> 3<00:05:11.040> so<00:05:12.040> negative<00:05:12.220> x<00:05:12.550> minus<00:05:13.210> 3<00:05:13.390> that's

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
negative 3 so negative x minus 3 that's

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.830 
negative 3 so negative x minus 3 that's
answer<00:05:14.200> choice<00:05:14.560> E
