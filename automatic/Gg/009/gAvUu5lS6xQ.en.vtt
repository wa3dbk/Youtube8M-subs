strap using two strips of packing tape
and<00:00:11.050> this<00:00:12.050> is<00:00:12.200> what<00:00:12.410> the<00:00:12.559> watch<00:00:12.709> strap<00:00:13.100> looks

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:13.309 
and this is what the watch strap looks

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.370 
and this is what the watch strap looks
like<00:00:14.139> that's<00:00:15.139> the<00:00:15.320> front<00:00:15.680> of<00:00:15.980> a<00:00:16.340> man's<00:00:16.580> watch

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:17.380

that the back of a man's watch and the
things<00:00:21.890> that<00:00:22.100> matter<00:00:22.310> are<00:00:22.850> the<00:00:23.840> two<00:00:24.110> ends

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
things that matter are the two ends

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.250 
things that matter are the two ends
which<00:00:26.720> when<00:00:26.960> it<00:00:26.990> comes<00:00:28.720> to<00:00:29.720> that<00:00:29.900> point

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 
which when it comes to that point

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.729 
which when it comes to that point
becomes<00:00:30.800> a<00:00:31.070> spiral<00:00:31.670> and<00:00:32.350> we've<00:00:33.350> got<00:00:33.500> two

becomes a spiral and we've got two

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.260 
becomes a spiral and we've got two
spirals<00:00:34.340> that<00:00:34.640> will<00:00:34.850> meet<00:00:35.059> and<00:00:35.270> interlock<00:00:37.270> the

that these two about four feet long or
1.2<00:00:55.670> meters<00:00:56.090> so<00:00:56.899> they<00:00:57.050> go<00:00:57.170> all<00:00:57.380> the<00:00:57.860> way<00:00:57.890> from

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
1.2 meters so they go all the way from

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:05.380 
1.2 meters so they go all the way from

this end to the end and what I'm going

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.980 
this end to the end and what I'm going
to<00:01:05.420> do<00:01:05.659> is<00:01:06.290> divide<00:01:08.049> it<00:01:09.049> in<00:01:09.290> half<00:01:09.320> do<00:01:10.280> a<00:01:10.310> hole

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
to do is divide it in half do a hole

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.390 
to do is divide it in half do a hole
here<00:01:12.490> make<00:01:13.490> a<00:01:13.520> V<00:01:13.880> shape<00:01:13.909> and<00:01:15.159> press<00:01:16.159> that

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.240 
here make a V shape and press that
roughly<00:01:16.820> about<00:01:17.030> 60<00:01:17.570> degrees<00:01:17.770> V<00:01:18.770> shape<00:01:21.250> also

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
roughly about 60 degrees V shape also

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.580 
roughly about 60 degrees V shape also
divide<00:01:22.970> the<00:01:23.240> other<00:01:23.390> one<00:01:23.690> in<00:01:24.500> half<00:01:25.869> and<00:01:26.869> the

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
divide the other one in half and the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.630 
divide the other one in half and the
division<00:01:27.950> point<00:01:28.490> now<00:01:28.820> interlocks<00:01:29.420> here<00:01:29.750> and

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
division point now interlocks here and

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.710 
division point now interlocks here and
we<00:01:31.640> now<00:01:31.820> have<00:01:32.180> four<00:01:32.930> strips<00:01:34.420> which<00:01:35.420> we<00:01:35.600> are

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
we now have four strips which we are

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.060 
we now have four strips which we are
going<00:01:35.900> to<00:01:36.020> pleat<00:01:37.869> the<00:01:38.869> pleating<00:01:39.320> is<00:01:39.439> always<00:01:39.799> at

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
going to pleat the pleating is always at

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.550 
going to pleat the pleating is always at
an<00:01:40.369> angle<00:01:40.729> of<00:01:40.820> 60<00:01:41.030> degrees<00:01:41.240> so<00:01:42.110> put<00:01:42.470> that

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
an angle of 60 degrees so put that

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.920 
an angle of 60 degrees so put that
underneath<00:01:44.500> put<00:01:45.500> this<00:01:45.650> one<00:01:45.860> over<00:01:46.810> it<00:01:47.810> is

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
underneath put this one over it is

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.770 
underneath put this one over it is
important<00:01:48.650> to<00:01:48.799> make<00:01:48.979> it<00:01:49.100> nice<00:01:49.310> and<00:01:49.340> tight

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
important to make it nice and tight

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.690 
important to make it nice and tight
because<00:01:50.780> this<00:01:50.990> plastic<00:01:51.650> always<00:01:52.400> wants<00:01:52.640> to

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
because this plastic always wants to

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.600 
because this plastic always wants to
open<00:01:52.880> out<00:01:53.500> so<00:01:54.500> they<00:01:54.619> end<00:01:54.890> up<00:01:55.009> with<00:01:55.189> a<00:01:55.220> hexagonal

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
open out so they end up with a hexagonal

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.930 
open out so they end up with a hexagonal
pattern<00:01:58.270> then

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
pattern then

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.440 
pattern then
let's<00:02:01.750> turn<00:02:02.230> this<00:02:02.380> right<00:02:02.650> over<00:02:02.890> there<00:02:03.360> put<00:02:04.360> it

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
let's turn this right over there put it

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.740 
let's turn this right over there put it
underneath<00:02:04.930> the<00:02:05.080> last<00:02:05.560> one<00:02:05.860> and<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:07.540> should

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
underneath the last one and you should

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.600 
underneath the last one and you should
now<00:02:07.900> have<00:02:07.930> a<00:02:08.410> hexagon<00:02:09.340> shape<00:02:11.250> what<00:02:12.250> we<00:02:12.400> need<00:02:12.580> to

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
now have a hexagon shape what we need to

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.180 
now have a hexagon shape what we need to
do<00:02:12.910> is<00:02:13.120> make<00:02:13.450> this<00:02:13.600> into<00:02:13.870> a<00:02:13.900> spiral<00:02:14.320> and<00:02:14.680> we'll

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
do is make this into a spiral and we'll

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:24.890 
do is make this into a spiral and we'll
do<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:15.490> sparrow<00:02:15.790> in<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.120> clockwise<00:02:16.450> pattern

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:43.970 

and<00:02:26.550> by<00:02:27.550> folding<00:02:28.120> these<00:02:30.030> only<00:02:31.030> from<00:02:31.270> one<00:02:31.480> side

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.800 

always<00:02:44.980> from<00:02:45.580> the<00:02:45.610> outside<00:02:46.150> so<00:02:46.480> that<00:02:46.510> we're

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
always from the outside so that we're

00:02:46.810 --> 00:03:03.540 
always from the outside so that we're
going<00:02:47.050> around<00:02:47.200> in<00:02:47.500> that<00:02:47.770> direction<00:03:02.550> making

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
going around in that direction making

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:48.780 
going around in that direction making
sure<00:03:03.580> it's<00:03:03.910> nice<00:03:04.120> and<00:03:04.180> tight<00:03:47.519> you've<00:03:48.519> now

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
sure it's nice and tight you've now

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.220 
sure it's nice and tight you've now
created<00:03:49.120> a<00:03:49.480> hexagon<00:03:51.209> now<00:03:52.209> we<00:03:52.390> have<00:03:52.540> to<00:03:52.690> go<00:03:52.840> past

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
created a hexagon now we have to go past

00:03:53.230 --> 00:04:27.900 
created a hexagon now we have to go past
the<00:03:53.470> hexagon

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:33.010 

this<00:04:28.910> hexagonal<00:04:29.510> pattern<00:04:31.300> going<00:04:32.300> to<00:04:32.479> go<00:04:32.660> past

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
this hexagonal pattern going to go past

00:04:33.020 --> 00:05:01.360 
this hexagonal pattern going to go past
it<00:04:33.410> and<00:04:53.770> we<00:04:54.770> now<00:04:54.950> have<00:04:55.310> a<00:04:55.930> complete<00:04:56.930> spiral<00:05:00.370> me

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
it and we now have a complete spiral me

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.260 
it and we now have a complete spiral me
by<00:05:01.700> folding<00:05:02.300> these<00:05:02.510> over<00:05:02.780> each<00:05:03.140> other<00:05:04.270> once

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
by folding these over each other once

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:16.570 
by folding these over each other once
you've<00:05:05.510> got<00:05:05.750> that<00:05:12.910> turn<00:05:13.910> it<00:05:14.120> over<00:05:14.330> and<00:05:15.400> we<00:05:16.400> now

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
you've got that turn it over and we now

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.370 
you've got that turn it over and we now
won<00:05:16.850> the<00:05:16.880> watch<00:05:17.180> strap<00:05:17.570> to<00:05:17.720> run<00:05:17.930> in<00:05:18.110> this

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
won the watch strap to run in this

00:05:18.380 --> 00:06:04.220 
won the watch strap to run in this
direction

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:04.230 

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:08.730 

right<00:06:05.230> now<00:06:06.870> that's<00:06:07.870> a<00:06:08.050> strip<00:06:08.350> that's<00:06:08.560> running

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740 
right now that's a strip that's running

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.430 
right now that's a strip that's running
across<00:06:09.070> and<00:06:09.430> it<00:06:09.550> was<00:06:09.670> exactly<00:06:10.120> that<00:06:10.240> way<00:06:10.510> but
