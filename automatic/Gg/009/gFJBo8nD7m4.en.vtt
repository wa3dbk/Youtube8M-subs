I'm<00:00:15.240> going<00:00:15.390> to<00:00:15.450> show<00:00:15.630> you<00:00:15.690> how<00:00:15.780> to<00:00:15.990> apply

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
I'm going to show you how to apply

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.829 
I'm going to show you how to apply
pre-bonded<00:00:16.919> hair<00:00:17.310> extensions<00:00:17.970> we<00:00:18.509> tend<00:00:18.749> to

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:18.839 
pre-bonded hair extensions we tend to

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:20.960 
pre-bonded hair extensions we tend to
use<00:00:18.990> what<00:00:19.529> we<00:00:19.619> do<00:00:19.769> use<00:00:20.070> pre<00:00:20.400> bonded<00:00:20.579> hair

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
use what we do use pre bonded hair

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.790 
use what we do use pre bonded hair
extensions<00:00:21.599> because<00:00:21.689> there's<00:00:22.140> no<00:00:22.320> separate

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
extensions because there's no separate

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.269 
extensions because there's no separate
messy<00:00:23.550> glue<00:00:23.970> or<00:00:24.179> wax<00:00:24.619> also<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.800> bond<00:00:26.009> that<00:00:26.159> we

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
messy glue or wax also the bond that we

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.339 
messy glue or wax also the bond that we
use<00:00:26.460> with<00:00:26.699> great<00:00:26.909> length<00:00:27.179> seeds<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.929> is<00:00:28.140> not

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
use with great length seeds it is not

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.649 
use with great length seeds it is not
it's<00:00:28.499> not<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.710> glue<00:00:29.039> it's<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.759> man-made<00:00:29.999> polymer

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:30.659 
it's not a glue it's a man-made polymer

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:32.720 
it's not a glue it's a man-made polymer
and<00:00:31.259> it<00:00:31.380> actually<00:00:31.529> makes<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.130> molecular

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
and it actually makes the molecular

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.790 
and it actually makes the molecular
structure<00:00:33.060> of<00:00:33.240> hair<00:00:33.600> it's<00:00:33.900> very<00:00:34.200> important<00:00:34.710> to

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
structure of hair it's very important to

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.520 
structure of hair it's very important to
make<00:00:35.130> sure<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:36.480> section<00:00:36.960> that<00:00:36.990> you<00:00:37.230> take

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
make sure that the section that you take

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.450 
make sure that the section that you take
is<00:00:38.360> the<00:00:39.360> same<00:00:39.630> as<00:00:39.900> the<00:00:40.560> thickness<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.220> the

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
is the same as the thickness of the

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.070 
is the same as the thickness of the
extension<00:00:42.150> that<00:00:42.270> you're<00:00:42.420> going<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.750> put<00:00:42.930> in

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.080 
extension that you're going to put in

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.810 
extension that you're going to put in
i'm<00:00:44.010> using<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.550> guard<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.330> we<00:00:46.820> separate

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
i'm using a guard so that we separate

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.160 
i'm using a guard so that we separate
the<00:00:48.030> hair<00:00:48.240> and<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.510> section<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:48.960> we've

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
the hair and the section that we've

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.660 
the hair and the section that we've
taken<00:00:49.440> from<00:00:49.800> all<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.070> other<00:00:50.190> little<00:00:50.370> hairs

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
taken from all the other little hairs

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.290 
taken from all the other little hairs
around<00:00:50.880> it<00:00:51.210> gets<00:00:51.390> rid<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.600> all<00:00:51.810> the<00:00:51.930> fine<00:00:52.170> hairs

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
around it gets rid of all the fine hairs

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.480 
around it gets rid of all the fine hairs
it's<00:00:54.300> also<00:00:54.450> very<00:00:54.720> important<00:00:55.290> to<00:00:55.320> remember<00:00:55.680> not

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:56.490 
it's also very important to remember not

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.910 
it's also very important to remember not
to<00:00:56.550> attach<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.420> hair<00:00:57.930> too<00:00:58.170> close<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.770> the

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
to attach the hair too close to the

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.120 
to attach the hair too close to the
scalp<00:00:59.190> if<00:00:59.670> you<00:01:00.270> touch<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.960> this<00:01:01.079> very<00:01:01.770> close

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.130 
scalp if you touch it to this very close

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.369 
scalp if you touch it to this very close
to<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.400> scalp<00:01:02.790> you're<00:01:03.630> also<00:01:03.780> going<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.229> get

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
to the scalp you're also going to get

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.899 
to the scalp you're also going to get
tension<00:01:04.890> because<00:01:05.190> the<00:01:05.339> hair<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.519> going<00:01:05.730> to<00:01:05.850> be

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
tension because the hair is going to be

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.730 
tension because the hair is going to be
pulling<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.450> there's<00:01:07.050> a<00:01:07.170> chance<00:01:07.440> that<00:01:07.530> you'll

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
pulling and there's a chance that you'll

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.700 
pulling and there's a chance that you'll
get<00:01:07.920> tension<00:01:08.400> sores<00:01:08.870> the<00:01:09.870> chat<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.350> there's<00:01:10.560> a

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
get tension sores the chat and there's a

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.560 
get tension sores the chat and there's a
chance<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:11.250> will<00:01:11.730> damage<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.180> scalp<00:01:12.480> and

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
chance that will damage the scalp and

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:20.609 
chance that will damage the scalp and
the<00:01:12.720> hair<00:01:12.870> once<00:01:13.140> again

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.050 

so<00:01:21.619> you<00:01:21.710> can<00:01:21.860> see<00:01:22.040> with<00:01:22.220> the<00:01:22.310> pre<00:01:22.490> bonded<00:01:22.670> hair

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
so you can see with the pre bonded hair

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.410 
so you can see with the pre bonded hair
extension<00:01:23.750> it's<00:01:24.560> very<00:01:24.799> clean<00:01:25.220> and<00:01:25.490> very<00:01:25.520> easy

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
extension it's very clean and very easy

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.450 
extension it's very clean and very easy
to<00:01:26.570> use<00:01:26.840> you<00:01:27.079> don't<00:01:27.259> have<00:01:27.470> any<00:01:27.649> messy<00:01:27.890> separate

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
to use you don't have any messy separate

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.310 
to use you don't have any messy separate
glue<00:01:28.670> or<00:01:28.850> wax<00:01:31.450> the<00:01:32.450> actual<00:01:32.780> method<00:01:33.020> of

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
glue or wax the actual method of

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.039 
glue or wax the actual method of
attaching<00:01:33.740> that<00:01:34.310> we're<00:01:34.460> using<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:35.149> arm

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
attaching that we're using the arm

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.460 
attaching that we're using the arm
doesn't<00:01:36.380> heat<00:01:36.740> up<00:01:36.770> you<00:01:37.520> can<00:01:37.700> hold<00:01:37.880> it<00:01:38.470> it's

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
doesn't heat up you can hold it it's

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.980 
doesn't heat up you can hold it it's
actually<00:01:39.740> using<00:01:40.369> ultrasonic<00:01:41.000> vibrations<00:01:41.780> and

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
actually using ultrasonic vibrations and

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.200 
actually using ultrasonic vibrations and
sending<00:01:42.439> it<00:01:42.560> through<00:01:42.860> the<00:01:43.039> bond<00:01:43.250> to<00:01:43.850> break<00:01:43.880> the

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
sending it through the bond to break the

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:56.290 
sending it through the bond to break the
bond<00:01:44.390> down<00:01:44.720> to<00:01:45.020> make<00:01:45.170> it<00:01:45.350> moldable<00:01:46.189> for<00:01:46.369> me

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.450 

I<00:01:56.390> tend<00:01:57.080> to<00:01:57.170> use<00:01:57.260> flat<00:01:57.680> bones<00:01:57.950> or<00:01:58.100> I<00:01:58.130> tend<00:01:58.370> to

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
I tend to use flat bones or I tend to

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.400 
I tend to use flat bones or I tend to
make<00:01:58.640> flat<00:01:59.000> bones<00:01:59.240> as<00:01:59.450> well<00:01:59.630> because<00:01:59.930> they<00:02:00.110> sit

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
make flat bones as well because they sit

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.530 
make flat bones as well because they sit
nice<00:02:01.040> and<00:02:01.070> flat<00:02:01.490> against<00:02:01.820> the<00:02:01.910> hair<00:02:02.210> when<00:02:02.420> the

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
nice and flat against the hair when the

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.110 
nice and flat against the hair when the
hairs<00:02:02.780> down<00:02:03.020> over<00:02:03.410> the<00:02:03.530> top<00:02:03.770> you<00:02:04.460> can't<00:02:04.730> feel

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
hairs down over the top you can't feel

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.690 
hairs down over the top you can't feel
it<00:02:05.150> it<00:02:05.960> also<00:02:06.110> helps<00:02:06.800> to<00:02:06.860> spread<00:02:07.220> the<00:02:07.460> hair<00:02:07.670> out

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
it it also helps to spread the hair out

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.880 
it it also helps to spread the hair out
so<00:02:08.090> you<00:02:08.150> get<00:02:08.390> a<00:02:08.420> much<00:02:08.660> more<00:02:08.900> natural<00:02:08.960> finish<00:02:09.619> on

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
so you get a much more natural finish on

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.550 
so you get a much more natural finish on
their<00:02:10.070> hair<00:02:10.450> we<00:02:11.450> can<00:02:11.630> do<00:02:11.720> a<00:02:11.750> forehead<00:02:12.200> to<00:02:12.380> get

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
their hair we can do a forehead to get

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.220 
their hair we can do a forehead to get
length<00:02:12.830> or<00:02:13.520> we<00:02:13.670> can<00:02:13.820> just<00:02:13.850> use<00:02:14.180> parts<00:02:14.750> or<00:02:14.930> use

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
length or we can just use parts or use
