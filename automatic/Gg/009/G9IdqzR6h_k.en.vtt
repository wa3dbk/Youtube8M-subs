00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
anything like that the opening of the

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.020 
anything like that the opening of the
glove<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:30.240> lined<00:00:30.720> with<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:31.289> with<00:00:32.160> leather<00:00:32.430> which

is a plus and I've mentioned it in other
reviews<00:00:36.000> now<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.660> think<00:00:37.079> that<00:00:37.200> goes<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.440> long<00:00:37.649> way

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
reviews now I think that goes a long way

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:38.900 
reviews now I think that goes a long way
towards<00:00:38.190> making<00:00:38.340> sure<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.790> doesn't

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
towards making sure that it doesn't

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.799 
towards making sure that it doesn't
start<00:00:39.180> tearing<00:00:40.190> as<00:00:41.190> you're<00:00:41.340> using<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:41.809> there's

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
start tearing as you're using it there's

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.569 
start tearing as you're using it there's
not<00:00:42.960> much<00:00:43.110> technology<00:00:43.649> incorporated<00:00:43.860> in<00:00:44.370> this

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579

vent holes in the thumb which to allow

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.160

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
anything but they're so tightly against

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
the scene there that it is a little

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.469 
the scene there that it is a little
uncomfortable

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
uncomfortable

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.350 
uncomfortable
additionally<00:01:58.159> and<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.280> thumb<00:01:59.549> is<00:01:59.850> sewn<00:02:00.180> down

additionally and the thumb is sewn down
at<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.600> tip<00:02:00.840> which<00:02:01.110> I'm<00:02:01.409> not<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.649> fan<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:01.979> and

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
at the tip which I'm not a fan of and

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.660 
at the tip which I'm not a fan of and
when<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:03.630> make<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.840> fist<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.409> pulls<00:02:05.280> in<00:02:05.549> the

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
when you make a fist it pulls in the

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.770 
when you make a fist it pulls in the
thumb<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.240> makes<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.509> even<00:02:06.600> more

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
thumb and makes it even more

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.889 
thumb and makes it even more
uncomfortable<00:02:07.459> so<00:02:08.459> I'm<00:02:08.849> sure<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:09.390> it's<00:02:09.509> it's

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
uncomfortable so I'm sure that it's it's

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.750 
uncomfortable so I'm sure that it's it's
for<00:02:10.289> safety<00:02:10.709> reasons<00:02:11.099> but

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
for safety reasons but

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.940 
for safety reasons but
and<00:02:12.940> what<00:02:13.180> the<00:02:13.269> foam<00:02:13.900> not<00:02:14.050> being<00:02:14.319> as<00:02:14.560> thick<00:02:14.769> as

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
and what the foam not being as thick as

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.949 
and what the foam not being as thick as
it<00:02:15.040> is<00:02:15.190> like<00:02:15.400> on<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:15.640> Lonsdale<00:02:16.030> of<00:02:16.300> the<00:02:16.750> thumb

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
it is like on the Lonsdale of the thumb

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.320 
it is like on the Lonsdale of the thumb
probably<00:02:17.620> has<00:02:17.799> to<00:02:17.950> be<00:02:18.069> pulled<00:02:18.310> in<00:02:18.489> some<00:02:18.730> but<00:02:19.239> it

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
probably has to be pulled in some but it

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.059 
probably has to be pulled in some but it
does<00:02:19.510> create<00:02:19.870> some<00:02:20.230> uncomfort<00:02:20.739> there<00:02:20.920> and<00:02:21.040> I

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
does create some uncomfort there and I

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
like the other two gloves that I've

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.809 
like the other two gloves that I've
reviewed<00:02:47.410> and<00:02:48.010> I<00:02:48.160> don't<00:02:48.340> think<00:02:48.519> that<00:02:48.610> it<00:02:48.700> was

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
reviewed and I don't think that it was

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.030 
reviewed and I don't think that it was
intended<00:02:49.180> to<00:02:49.329> be<00:02:49.420> this<00:02:50.410> is<00:02:50.620> more<00:02:50.859> like<00:02:51.010> a

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
intended to be this is more like a

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.250 
intended to be this is more like a
16-ounce<00:02:51.790> version<00:02:52.269> of<00:02:52.390> a<00:02:52.450> professional<00:02:53.019> fight

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
16-ounce version of a professional fight

16-ounce version of a professional fight
glove<00:02:53.560> and<00:02:54.010> I<00:02:54.489> just<00:02:54.700> don't<00:02:54.879> think<00:02:55.060> it's<00:02:55.440> at<00:02:56.440> all

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
glove and I just don't think it's at all

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.080 
glove and I just don't think it's at all
like<00:02:56.950> the<00:02:57.250> other<00:02:57.400> two<00:02:57.549> gloves<00:02:57.730> so<00:02:57.849> I<00:02:57.879> don't

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
like the other two gloves so I don't

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.970 
like the other two gloves so I don't
have<00:02:58.209> a<00:02:58.239> hard<00:02:58.540> time<00:02:58.690> comparing<00:02:59.230> it<00:02:59.349> but<00:02:59.829> what<00:02:59.950> I

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
have a hard time comparing it but what I

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.259 
have a hard time comparing it but what I
will<00:03:00.160> tell<00:03:00.370> you<00:03:00.519> is<00:03:00.670> that<00:03:00.730> if<00:03:00.970> you're<00:03:01.150> in<00:03:01.239> the

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
will tell you is that if you're in the

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.569 
will tell you is that if you're in the
market<00:03:01.510> for<00:03:01.959> a<00:03:02.200> glove<00:03:02.859> that<00:03:03.069> you<00:03:03.129> can<00:03:03.400> really

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
market for a glove that you can really

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:05.220 
market for a glove that you can really

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
feel your hand in when you make contact

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.410 
feel your hand in when you make contact
and<00:03:05.829> that<00:03:06.810> you're<00:03:07.810> not<00:03:07.959> interested<00:03:08.440> in<00:03:08.739> how

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
and that you're not interested in how

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.690 
and that you're not interested in how
soft<00:03:10.420> it<00:03:10.599> is<00:03:10.720> for<00:03:11.319> your<00:03:11.470> opponent<00:03:11.890> then<00:03:12.459> I

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
soft it is for your opponent then I

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.069 
soft it is for your opponent then I
would<00:03:12.849> say<00:03:13.000> this<00:03:13.150> is<00:03:13.299> probably<00:03:13.329> amongst<00:03:13.930> the

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
would say this is probably amongst the

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.120 
would say this is probably amongst the
best<00:03:14.349> in<00:03:14.650> that<00:03:14.980> in<00:03:15.459> that<00:03:15.519> niche<00:03:16.000> market

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
best in that in that niche market

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.589 
best in that in that niche market
without<00:03:18.130> a<00:03:18.160> doubt<00:03:18.459> one<00:03:18.700> of<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:18.819> nicest<00:03:19.329> gloves

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
without a doubt one of the nicest gloves

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.949 
without a doubt one of the nicest gloves
I've<00:03:19.840> seen<00:03:20.370> overall<00:03:21.370> not<00:03:21.669> as<00:03:21.880> comfortable<00:03:22.209> as

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
I've seen overall not as comfortable as

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.599 
I've seen overall not as comfortable as
I<00:03:23.109> would<00:03:23.260> like<00:03:23.440> it<00:03:23.590> to<00:03:23.709> be<00:03:23.739> but<00:03:24.040> again<00:03:24.190> it's

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
I would like it to be but again it's

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:27.089 
I would like it to be but again it's
because<00:03:25.120> it's<00:03:25.299> more<00:03:25.569> like<00:03:25.810> a<00:03:26.099> professional
