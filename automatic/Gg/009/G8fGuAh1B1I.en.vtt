00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello to all these facts the balloons on 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.309
 finds himself for a draw rather a 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.860
 new tutorial it's complicated then 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:11.880
 so it's to get the items up 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.349
 in a straight line 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.400
 so it's not me who invented the 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:20.340
 circuit but I make them French ranks 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.920
 that's like that I'm going to 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:35.610
 show 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:39.000
 I take this so we can see that a 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:45.840
 such they go up directly then after 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:49.140
 he is going so it seems to be there I'm going to do 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.289
 the tutorial finally yes obviously I 'm going 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.940
 do it look like it's not 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.590
 super big still at the expense of 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.859
 depend on the size of the system that 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:05.149
 we are going to do too so we get 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.149
 find for you to pay everything says 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:15.619
 so let's go we'll do the system 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:18.210
 so you have to do your job 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:21.119
 where you want it down there 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.770
 prefers a little bit in height for 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.890
 finally you will see you will see 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.890
 Why 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:41.649
 the good I am maybe a little bit 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:45.070
 too much to i just take some water yes 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:48.630
 so here I am a con 5 May but this 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:52.240
 system can work in 4.7 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:58.420
 finally I normally think it must 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:02:12.730
 the night is perfect it's all 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:15.280
 battery on his then there because so 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.150
 there we get a little better I do not know 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.840
 I can not put string 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.100
 on the ice finally I take but you 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.030
 know that tricks will not be 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:32.580
 to do a little bit higher 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.580
 it does not change much in the system 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:37.079
 at 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:50.610
 so here he is fat poyac 11 lyon 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.610
 France and the hooks here is the string 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:03:11.260
 we are going to put 2 of ice no 4 in 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:14.549
 do it like that without forgetting that here 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:21.010
 is bad and I'm here too 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:25.989
 then then that's going to be the start I 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:29.019
 do not trouble the case so already the powder 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:34.019
 then a repeater hot stuff here here 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:40.769
 on screen 4 another here offering 4 also 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:47.709
 connected by the stone the 34 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:49.109
 here so here there will be a piston I believe 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:58.049
 I find myself 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:58.049
 we just know there a piston then have 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:09.519
 written peter hook rank 4 6 6 2 and the 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.790
 running in this torch hp shot of 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:11.790
 tangier 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:29.220
 in this torch here you put a 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:34.130
 repeater at big 4 then the alas the 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.130
 decent powder 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:52.279
 alami so sorry for the little hole of 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:05:01.409
 memory with here so here at camp 4 

00:04:52.279 --> 00:05:10.319
 etc if here large 4.6 the vote powder 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:15.449
 be here yes here 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:18.539
 so here the piston with you can 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:24.389
 put a glass block directly here 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:27.300
 the other track we have there with a block of 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:32.430
 glass also so for the tower too 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:33.979
 do it like this here you do it the 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:47.189
 height you want normand it goes up 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:50.659
 at the height you want yes so that 

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:50.659
 shows up to the height you want g 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:08.890
 yes so yeah here and there then of 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.660
 do not wet and especially important 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:13.950
 do not forget to fill inside 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.950
 also if we are not working 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.730
 by then I do not fill the last floor 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:25.060
 but it is for the items to stay there 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:33.660
 high so here butcher finds it on it 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:33.660
 for from redstone to 2 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:49.530
 and I forgot something ah yes 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:50.940
 here is big 4 the repeat in valence 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:53.400
 is supposed to work so we'll see that 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:55.550
 right now to I put him water here 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.550
 as well 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:03.120
 so I did not do that with the 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:09.350
 % peter rice with the disc would only be 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:09.350
 not necessary so I put my and ola 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:17.670
 to lint ok so that's good then time 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:31.590
 against if you break here for example and 

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:35.580
 indesca was going to manon save you hell 

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:46.320
 sounded good good after he's gone good 

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:47.220
 we will show that there yes he goes out 

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:50.130
 because they're going 

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:54.270
 it may seem to us so it must be well 

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:55.920
 the butcher turn this is this tutorial 

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:59.010
 is already finished the tower could do it 

00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:04.110
 the brother you want with all the 

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:05.850
 world everybody has it's the end of 

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:07.800
 this tutorial we soon expect to 

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:10.880
 had another tutorial it's hard to say 

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.880
 go hi to all
