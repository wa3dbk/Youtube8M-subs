00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:55.780 
careful being at the brake gets

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.659 
careful being at the brake gets
gradually<00:06:56.020> thinner<00:06:56.590> because<00:06:57.069> you've<00:06:57.430> left

00:06:57.659 --> 00:06:57.669 
gradually thinner because you've left

00:06:57.669 --> 00:06:59.969

out<00:06:57.819> small<00:06:58.210> amounts<00:06:58.629> of<00:06:58.719> hair<00:06:59.020> as<00:06:59.259> you<00:06:59.560> were

00:06:59.969 --> 00:06:59.979 
out small amounts of hair as you were

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:02.309 
out small amounts of hair as you were
actually<00:07:00.520> creating<00:07:01.060> your<00:07:01.090> braids<00:07:01.479> now

actually creating your braids now

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:04.290 
actually creating your braids now
because<00:07:02.740> you<00:07:02.949> added<00:07:03.280> small<00:07:03.550> amounts<00:07:03.909> of<00:07:04.000> hair

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:04.300 
because you added small amounts of hair

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.110 
because you added small amounts of hair
to<00:07:04.840> avoid<00:07:05.080> tangling<00:07:05.830> you<00:07:06.159> have<00:07:06.370> to<00:07:06.580> smooth<00:07:06.940> the

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:07.120 
to avoid tangling you have to smooth the

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.020 
to avoid tangling you have to smooth the
hair<00:07:07.150> out<00:07:07.780> of<00:07:07.840> the<00:07:08.319> actual<00:07:08.830> extensions<00:07:09.610> so

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:10.030 
hair out of the actual extensions so

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:11.760 
hair out of the actual extensions so
that<00:07:10.210> way<00:07:10.360> they<00:07:10.569> don't<00:07:10.599> bunch<00:07:11.169> up<00:07:11.440> near<00:07:11.740> your

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:11.770 
that way they don't bunch up near your

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.520 
that way they don't bunch up near your
root<00:07:12.190> which<00:07:12.460> causes<00:07:13.060> a<00:07:13.210> lot<00:07:13.659> of<00:07:13.690> tangling<00:07:14.500> and

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:14.530 
root which causes a lot of tangling and

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:16.950 
root which causes a lot of tangling and
matting<00:07:15.039> so<00:07:15.490> every<00:07:15.729> time<00:07:15.940> you're<00:07:16.330> unraveling

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:16.960 
matting so every time you're unraveling

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.980 
matting so every time you're unraveling
the<00:07:17.020> braid<00:07:17.259> smooth<00:07:18.159> out<00:07:18.490> the<00:07:18.849> added<00:07:19.270> extension

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:19.990 
the braid smooth out the added extension

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:22.230 
the braid smooth out the added extension
hair<00:07:20.229> from<00:07:20.620> your<00:07:20.860> real<00:07:21.069> hair<00:07:21.310> to<00:07:21.759> avoid<00:07:21.849> the
