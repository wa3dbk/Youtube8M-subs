might take up a while to sell and it's

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.970 
might take up a while to sell and it's
better<00:00:42.719> off<00:00:42.809> sometimes<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.379> trade<00:00:43.590> with<00:00:43.770> more

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
better off sometimes to trade with more

better off sometimes to trade with more
popular<00:00:44.309> players<00:00:44.550> because<00:00:45.000> whilst<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.390> might

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
popular players because whilst you might

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
team there by the way I do admit it's

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.780 
team there by the way I do admit it's
not<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.530> best<00:01:31.680> hybrid<00:01:31.920> there's<00:01:32.460> six

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
not the best hybrid there's six

not the best hybrid there's six
Brazilians<00:01:33.240> in<00:01:33.360> there<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.570> do<00:01:33.659> believe<00:01:34.049> which

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
Brazilians in there I do believe which

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.469 
Brazilians in there I do believe which
kind<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.070> makes<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.460> bit<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.880> hybrid<00:01:36.360> but

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
kind of makes it a bit of a hybrid but

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.149 
kind of makes it a bit of a hybrid but
even<00:01:36.750> so<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:37.140> knows<00:01:37.380> like<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.530> fun<00:01:37.770> team<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.040> play

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
even so it knows like a fun team to play

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.800 
even so it knows like a fun team to play
with<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.549> wasn't<00:01:38.670> gonna<00:01:38.820> say<00:01:39.060> no<00:01:39.270> at<00:01:39.689> the

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810
