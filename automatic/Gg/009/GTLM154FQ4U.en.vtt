 overview of the most interesting hockey publication

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.699
 soviet coach anatoly taras yesterday

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.330
 Biktimirov remembers something 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.790
 statements of hockey players about their coach 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.320
 that's what he told and did that Vladislav 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.730
 Tretyak 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.700
 Anatoly Vladimir is unique in his 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.430
 kind of take me a 17 year old boy in 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.680
 basis csk and then to the national team for 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.960
 sometimes I know a lot of risk 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.239
 he sometimes had a hard time training 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.370
 Tarasov was merciless to me and sometimes 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.070
 just raped guys at all thought 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.289

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.660

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.579
 you have to come to the training session tomorrow morning 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.589
 and reflect thousands of shots bottom he doesn't 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.659
 checked because I knew I would come and 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.450
 I'll do it even with children from the nursery 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.369
 schools or youth teams and when we forced 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.439
 me jump over the blue line on one 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.990
 leg from one push to full 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.549
 ammunition and I jumped he certainly wanted 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.240
 so that I become a real master and 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.009
 taught moment the highest discipline and here 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.470
 that Anatoly Tarasov himself spoke about 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.840
 hockey and hockey players do not feel sorry for people 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.670
 who indifferent sport seems to me 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.040
 they are great unite their lives this 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.360
 damn interesting profession 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.150
 bring up strong and body and spirit 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.920
 people i love my guys exactly 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.259
 therefore , something that was never required of them 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.479
 could not make anyone else genuine 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.270
 courage incompatible with rude rude 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.520
 rus bully strong bold and cysts plays 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.189
 dramatically courageously but never strike 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.689
 rival from under tishka courage this 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.909
 ability to refuse a fight 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.770
 I know how hard it is to restrain myself 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.329
 it's a shame to tolerate rudeness 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.729
 some overly zealous 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.299
 athlete how great is the temptation to give him 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.579
 surrender 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.729
 but genuine courage requires restraint and 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.729
 patience 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.690
 sdk canceled big plus disciplinary 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.230
 penalty attacker CSKA Alexander 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.940
 Radulov 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.819
 head of the committee Valery Kamensky 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.290
 commented on this decision we 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.209
 reviewed the episode and and came to 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.430
 unanimous opinion that radula in that 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.950
 the moment did not break the rules therefore and 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.840
 Judges Commission and sdk decided to remove 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.760
 alexander big plus disciplinary 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.319
 penalty until the end of the game respectively 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.660
 nothing prevents radolov to take 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.849
 participate in the next match the day before 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.440
 Head of Judging Department ChL 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.780
 Alexander Poles told the agency 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.459
 r-sport about changes in interpretations 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.190
 rules regarding the use of force 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.380
 receptions at the meetings of judges we took 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.049
 interpretation of this moment that when a player 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.640
 owners I would rival him and he 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.440
 applies against this rival 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.480
 certain power reception can 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.239
 talk about that player owning the pucks 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.549
 protect the puck but when the player owns 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.890
 washer and then gives a pass and become 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:04.260
 not owning the puck and then beating 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.040
 the rival who drives it is not the same 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:13.049
 owns the puck 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:15.359
 this violation dmitry arkalov called 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:17.700
 top ten khl players on the basis of 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:19.769
 last week, the three locked forward 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.049
 Riga dynamo mix indrasis which 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:25.319
 either recognized as the best forward past 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:27.180
 7 days we are certainly a league choice but respect 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:30.150
 put the best forward week 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.889
 only 3 place to the person who issued 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.600
 double into the gate ska by definition 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:36.180
 worthy of special mention 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.819
 indrasis mix statistics as well 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.280
 organically however if you look closely 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.139
 out of three goals one Latvian spent with 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.959
 bullets another sent into an empty net 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:48.120
 but in one match against severstal points 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.670
 not scored at all as a whole, everything is very 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.760
 not bad and indrasis really on fire 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.290
 but up to 1 place falls short 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.260
 silver went to another player 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.060
 kayla dynamo wilson 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.530
 in close proximity to indrashis 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.599
 and his teammate 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.549
 as a rule such a paired leadership 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:07.739
 happens attacking speakers in one 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:09.780
 link Riga case of exception 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.370
 This story is about what your opponent needs 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.320
 be attentive at least 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.570
 the presence of two triples and so what 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.120
 that scored to and wilson exclusively 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.660
 thanks to the mistakes of the locomotive players for 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.610
 tonic 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.920
 of the players in the whole caehill didn't score 

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:25.290
 so many points to this Canadian legion 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:28.050
 Riga residents to his stability points in each 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.790
 the match is definitely captivating and headed 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.970
 so honorable short list goalkeeper 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.740
 Medvescak Mark de her last 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.560
 barry brust and more recently sushi lice and 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.750
 one rusk after another went on the ice 24 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.790
 November since at the gates of the Medvescak 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.490
 can only meet one person a 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.410
 his name is marc de to her for this time he 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.200
 lost just two matches one of which 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.240
 on shootouts and if we consider the total 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.280
 last week it is wildly not allowed 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.560
 take your team from Siberia and 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.030
 far east 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.940
 breathtaking 10 points out of 12 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:02.070
 possible in passing, he designed a 2 shot outs 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.900
 and after the match in Novosibirsk it was possible 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.850
 lose count how many times main 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.510
 the Croat coach pronounced his last name 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.850
 goalkeeper 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:11.130
 Here we are not shy and set 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.190
 Canadian with Croatian roots for the first 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.190
 a place 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.360
 Honored Coach of Russia Sergey Cherkasy 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.970
 shared his opinion on 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.770
 prospects of Russian goalkeepers to become 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.110
 the first number of the national team in Sochi 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.930
 The specialist believes that the best chances in 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.820
 this plan the varlamov's seeds 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.680
 If you look at the game, then Varlamov plays 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.840
 decent and while he's closer to that 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.270
 take the first position in the Olympics than 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.190
 Anyone but see how further the seed 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.360
 will continue to play and how will 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.139
 take shape his judicial 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.389
 proceedings 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:46.669
 no matter how much barracks say what you think 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:48.770
 only hockey his constantly tugging on 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:51.080
 by some third - party unpleasant question and 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.240
 it can influence him psychologically 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.800
 but it seems to me that the seed is very resistant 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.960
 boy he can put up 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.700
 and get together at the right moment yesterday 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.860
