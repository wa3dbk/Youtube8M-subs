00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:13.109
 will animate the researchers spend a lot of time but this pigsty installed 

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:14.059
 on the site 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.390
 a building that for many on this riddim maternity 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.159
 where gym for the most athletic 

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:23.769
 for research the pig lends itself well to the game because it is the model the 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:27.749
 closer to humans and many similarities digestive or cerebral 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.170
 isabelle leroux director to seek his field of investigation the children 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.370
 who have a low birth weight and perinatal nutrition 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.800
 so she works on piglets and lugubriages is essential 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.380
 we are far from once a day 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.980
 of Greek debt 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.660
 and that's about the same as the baby 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.080
 formed two hours a year their more than two hours 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.730
 actually she is also the minister 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.680
 6 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.870
 for five months 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.610
 therefore it is necessary to be fed with milk it loses protein 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.470
 it is this same diet that is given to newborns with a delay of 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.680
 intrauterine growth 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.060
 the team is working on the merits of this empirical practice 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.380
 the second step announced must this diet is daddy 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.130
 tnt to other consequences 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.860
 consequences that can maybe a minor no that do not appear 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.880
 who are not at all fully fit 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.380
 but that could have long-term repercussions 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.380
 and that's something completely new quite new 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.040
 who has tested sports and so far it's the relationships between nutrition 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.369
 of the newborn child and the subsequent consequences in terms of 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.490
 development of sensitivity to Paris pathologies as a commission of 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.260
 strasbourg 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.350
 which the researchers of the INRA turn of the pediatricians of the southern headquarters of 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.710
 reindeer or nantes 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.030
 because this research should change the nutrition of the newborn from 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.070
 little ones to improve it in the texan that increases one hopes murderer 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.179
 advance knowledge about the field 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:59.939
 and perhaps lead to current practices possibly diminishing before 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.010
 any case partially their protein investments 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.440
 but also being more vigilant I bet on monitoring one of his 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.079
 children and little ones 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:11.909
 and that posed harmful owner in the idea of ​​preventing 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:15.249
 a sense of discomfort and ingenious that if it's possible 

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:19.279
 other research unit other area of ​​investigation but still the body 

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:21.259
 as a mini port model 

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:24.709
 this one but almost 40 pounds in adulthood 5 times less 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.069
 channelys the normal 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.479
 an important detail because the research focuses on obesity 

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:33.629
 so these specimens that were put to the result highlights florent tripe of 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.629
 volume to reach 600 kilos 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:38.959
 say morbid 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.560
 Obesity is a disease that is not fatal in itself 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.379
 on the other hand we have dramatic consequences 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.379
 for the human being of what is affected by morbid obesity 

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:54.519
 e and percent and its consequences is diabetes is cancer finally 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:55.509
 certain cancers 

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:58.169
 if cardiovascular disorders 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:01.409
 in the clip it was partly necessary for the community 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:05.519
 to reduce as far as possible the number of people who 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.039
 are affected by obesity 

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:08.129
 the challenge 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.260
 find a way to lose weight these animals his intervention type ring 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.569
 gastric and without pharmacological treatment 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.829
 the therapy imagine the new stimulation a track that had not yet 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:22.019
 never been used to fight obesity 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.439
 this deserves an explanation with a diagram these 10 of sic 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:28.860
 but effective what happens between the qb party justice and the brain 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:30.309
 on the other hand 

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:33.149
 it's that transit information 

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:33.989
 bitter 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.060
 a huge a huge back or information called the nerve 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.679
 wave 

00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:41.779
 we have the lider 

00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:45.919
 substitute dare information normally coming from the tube 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:47.309
 digestive 

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:49.349
 quite simply 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:51.799
 there the setting up 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:53.979
 stimulator scorer 

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:56.689
 electric on the vagus nerve 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:59.779
 in fact this stimulator is when we placed electrodes 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:02.879
 surgically on nirvana 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:06.219
 these electrodes will provide a current because at these electrodes 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:07.439
 we couple 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:10.079
 a kind of bite that we will place under the skin 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:14.540
 which is programmable remotely and who carries the milk money the activity of the 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.540
 vagus nerve and that will make believe to the brain who come to eat 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.870
 the equation his duo of spaced or on billiards and a vagal stimulator is 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:23.849
 implanted 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:27.069
 the results related to the meager seed are convincing and especially there 

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:29.789
 has no side effects 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:32.789
 joseph and vagal stimulation on Portuguese roads 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:36.900
 were the following of the duty it makes it possible to reduce the food intake 

00:04:36.899 --> 00:04:41.039
 up to 30% less on some weeks so it's pretty m6 very 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:42.219
 significant 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:45.999
 secondly we did not prevent the animals is intended to take the 

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:49.120
 weight so comparison foods that was not stimulated take 

00:04:49.119 --> 00:04:52.240
 significantly weight therefore escape in weight recovery 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.940
 and thirdly we managed martine aubert ring to change if the choices 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.250
 animal feeds thank you 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.710
 to rebalance when starting again 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.199
 unless the power supplies 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:07.580
 it's once the results on the ports can remain alone on the text 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.360
 on the man 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.839
 a patent of this vagal stimulator was filed in 2006 by murat 

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:17.639
 the reindeer cesu now after the relay because sumner to echo surgeons 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:19.169
 authors of this discovery 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.169
 implantation on the man is preparing 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.659
 we hope a person can do that if the queen 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:27.009
 Mount-of-marsan 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:29.330
 all the necessary skills 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.479
 the researchers say they agree we think we can install his 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:34.759
 by laparoscopy, that is to say by an intervention 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:36.520
 with us tiny 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.559
 precision 

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:40.850
 the cvjr meets but very quickly so 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.220
 there is no reason we do not start as soon as the material is aware 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.379
 can be thought of since 

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:46.199
 the shot 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:49.449
 concept of the fact that the simulation of the two seas 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:51.460
 the media us 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.509
 this inra team has been working on obesity for over ten years the 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:59.690
 first implantation in humans is envisaged within two to three years 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.949
 example of project to lead 2 ap to this part the mine ity 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:06.469
 from basic research to applied research 

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:09.469
 and the loop will be looped 

00:06:10.619 --> 00:06:11.109
 in times of crisis
