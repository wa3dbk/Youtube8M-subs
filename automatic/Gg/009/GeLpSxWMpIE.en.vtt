00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
so this really holes in the bucket now

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.040 
so this really holes in the bucket now
so<00:00:10.830> that<00:00:11.010> glass<00:00:11.730> can<00:00:11.970> get<00:00:12.210> in<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:12.540> magnets<00:00:12.870> can

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:13.050 
so that glass can get in and magnets can

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:21.170 
so that glass can get in and magnets can
get<00:00:13.290> out<00:00:18.529> and<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:20.130> want<00:00:20.279> holes<00:00:20.490> on<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.760> sides<00:00:21.000> of

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
get out and I want holes on the sides of

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.090 
get out and I want holes on the sides of
the<00:00:21.240> bucket<00:00:21.510> -<00:00:21.720> this<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.170> especially<00:00:22.770> so<00:00:23.040> that

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
the bucket - this is especially so that

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.339 
the bucket - this is especially so that
flies<00:00:23.369> can<00:00:23.610> get<00:00:23.790> in<00:00:23.880> so<00:00:24.450> I<00:00:24.480> won't<00:00:24.930> make<00:00:25.020> as<00:00:25.230> many

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:25.349 
flies can get in so I won't make as many

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.619 
these meat scraps which I got for free
at<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.350> butchers<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:59.699> went<00:01:00.089> there<00:01:00.210> with<00:01:00.329> my<00:01:00.390> own

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
at the butchers I went there with my own

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.869 
at the butchers I went there with my own
container<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.469> pair<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:01.890> gloves<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.579> I

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
container and a pair of gloves and I

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.430 
container and a pair of gloves and I
looked<00:01:03.089> real<00:01:03.300> ready<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.809> pick<00:01:04.050> through<00:01:04.260> there

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
looked real ready to pick through there

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.690 
looked real ready to pick through there
their<00:01:05.010> trash<00:01:05.309> bucket<00:01:05.900> and<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:07.950> got<00:01:08.490> that

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
their trash bucket and so I got that

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.580 
their trash bucket and so I got that
from<00:01:09.690> them

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.929 

and<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:13.770> what<00:01:13.890> I'm<00:01:13.950> going<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.100> do<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.460> line<00:01:14.880> the

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
and so what I'm going to do is line the

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.300 
and so what I'm going to do is line the
bottom<00:01:15.270> with<00:01:15.420> some<00:01:15.750> some<00:01:16.259> loose<00:01:16.500> leaves<00:01:16.860> and

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
bottom with some some loose leaves and

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.670 
bottom with some some loose leaves and
maybe<00:01:18.299> bits<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.900> scraps<00:01:19.290> for<00:01:19.470> my<00:01:19.619> compost<00:01:20.130> pile

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
maybe bits of scraps for my compost pile

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.260 
maybe bits of scraps for my compost pile
probably<00:01:22.680> brown<00:01:22.890> leaves<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.579> I<00:01:23.729> put<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.240> the

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
probably brown leaves and I put the the

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.389 
probably brown leaves and I put the the
meat<00:01:24.840> in<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.320> then<00:01:25.619> I'm<00:01:25.740> going<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.950> cover<00:01:26.220> the

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
meat in and then I'm going to cover the

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:30.440 
meat in and then I'm going to cover the
top<00:01:26.610> with<00:01:26.640> loose<00:01:27.000> leaves<00:01:27.270> -<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:28.909> the<00:01:29.909> idea<00:01:30.270> is

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
top with loose leaves - so the idea is

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.719 
top with loose leaves - so the idea is
that<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.990> Flies<00:01:31.649> will<00:01:31.890> come<00:01:32.009> in<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.250> top

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
that the Flies will come in the top

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.560 
that the Flies will come in the top
holes<00:01:33.030> they'll<00:01:33.810> lay<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.259> eggs<00:01:34.439> inside<00:01:35.450> in<00:01:36.450> the

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
holes they'll lay the eggs inside in the

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.620 
holes they'll lay the eggs inside in the
meat<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:37.350> larvae<00:01:38.280> will<00:01:38.310> will<00:01:39.060> hatch<00:01:39.299> in<00:01:39.540> the

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
meat the larvae will will hatch in the

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.709 
meat the larvae will will hatch in the
meat<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.430> they<00:01:41.430> will<00:01:41.640> instinctively<00:01:42.030> go

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:42.719 
meat and they will instinctively go

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:46.880 
meat and they will instinctively go
through<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.110> bottom<00:01:43.469> holes<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:44.700> find<00:01:45.740> to<00:01:46.740> go

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
through the bottom holes to find to go

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.410 
through the bottom holes to find to go
into<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.219> ground<00:01:47.490> where<00:01:47.790> they're<00:01:48.030> supposed

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
into the ground where they're supposed

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.420 
into the ground where they're supposed
to<00:01:48.479> poop<00:01:48.719> it<00:01:48.869> but<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.710> course<00:01:49.920> I'm<00:01:50.189> going<00:01:50.219> to

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
to poop it but of course I'm going to

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.789 
to poop it but of course I'm going to
catch<00:01:50.640> them<00:01:51.170> once<00:01:52.170> they<00:01:52.350> get<00:01:52.439> out<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.740> the

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
catch them once they get out of the

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.469 
catch them once they get out of the
bottom<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.280> I'm<00:01:53.729> going<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.969> feed<00:01:54.119> them<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.450> my

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
bottom and I'm going to feed them to my

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:02.080 
bottom and I'm going to feed them to my
chickens

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.469 

okay<00:02:02.720> so<00:02:02.780> this<00:02:03.520> there's<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:04.759> general<00:02:04.970> idea

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
okay so this there's the general idea

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:14.100 
okay so this there's the general idea
there<00:02:11.140> make<00:02:12.140> those<00:02:12.319> holes<00:02:12.530> too<00:02:12.739> big<00:02:12.890> these

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
there make those holes too big these

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.520 
there make those holes too big these
lock<00:02:15.110> washers<00:02:15.590> I<00:02:15.800> like<00:02:16.099> lock<00:02:16.310> washers<00:02:17.530> washer

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
lock washers I like lock washers washer

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.290 
lock washers I like lock washers washer
doesn't<00:02:19.310> pick<00:02:19.610> up<00:02:19.880> fat<00:02:20.750> washer<00:02:21.970> okay<00:02:22.970> I<00:02:23.000> say

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.150 
table so you find it easy to remove
because<00:02:59.630> obviously<00:03:00.019> it<00:03:00.319> has<00:03:00.470> holes<00:03:00.799> here<00:03:01.040> and

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
because obviously it has holes here and

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.650 
because obviously it has holes here and
I<00:03:01.220> don't<00:03:01.280> want<00:03:01.549> the<00:03:01.640> maggots<00:03:01.970> to<00:03:02.120> get<00:03:02.299> out<00:03:02.450> I

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
I don't want the maggots to get out I

don't want to dirty up this bucket with
maggots<00:03:05.900> I'm<00:03:06.709> not<00:03:06.890> sure<00:03:07.100> I<00:03:07.370> got<00:03:08.030> to<00:03:08.150> think

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
maggots I'm not sure I got to think

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:15.520 
maggots I'm not sure I got to think
about<00:03:08.420> this

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.930 

strap<00:03:16.530> out<00:03:16.740> of<00:03:16.770> this<00:03:16.950> rubber<00:03:17.250> that's<00:03:17.580> going<00:03:17.790> to

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
strap out of this rubber that's going to

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.030 
strap out of this rubber that's going to
it's<00:03:18.840> just<00:03:19.050> going<00:03:19.170> to<00:03:19.260> be<00:03:19.320> friendlier<00:03:19.680> to<00:03:19.920> the

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
it's just going to be friendlier to the

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.540 
it's just going to be friendlier to the

tree branch I don't know how I'm going

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:24.860 
tree branch I don't know how I'm going
to<00:03:23.670> tell<00:03:23.820> it<00:03:23.850> on<00:03:24.060> yet<00:03:24.240> but<00:03:24.390> we'll<00:03:24.510> figure<00:03:24.690> that

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
to tell it on yet but we'll figure that

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.960 
to tell it on yet but we'll figure that
out<00:03:24.930> when<00:03:25.140> we<00:03:25.170> get<00:03:25.320> there<00:03:25.380> I've<00:03:26.370> got<00:03:26.400> a<00:03:26.760> little

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
out when we get there I've got a little

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.950 
out when we get there I've got a little
leaves<00:03:27.870> and<00:03:28.050> compost<00:03:29.510> that's<00:03:30.510> all<00:03:30.690> I'm<00:03:30.810> going

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
leaves and compost that's all I'm going

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.050 
leaves and compost that's all I'm going
to<00:03:31.020> put<00:03:31.230> in<00:03:31.320> the<00:03:31.410> bottom<00:03:31.830> I<00:03:32.070> want<00:03:32.670> the<00:03:32.760> maggots

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
to put in the bottom I want the maggots

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.270 
to put in the bottom I want the maggots
table<00:03:33.420> to<00:03:33.480> find<00:03:33.690> their<00:03:33.840> way<00:03:33.990> through

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
table to find their way through

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.260 
table to find their way through
hopefully<00:03:35.280> they<00:03:35.430> don't<00:03:35.550> go<00:03:35.700> through<00:03:35.820> the<00:03:35.940> side

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
hopefully they don't go through the side

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.580 
hopefully they don't go through the side
holes<00:03:36.510> too<00:03:36.750> much<00:03:36.930> I<00:03:37.050> don't<00:03:37.200> really<00:03:37.350> want<00:03:37.530> to

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
holes too much I don't really want to

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
beautiful pretty much a leaf pile I want

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.780 
beautiful pretty much a leaf pile I want
to<00:03:56.120> make<00:03:56.209> sure<00:03:56.239> that<00:03:56.540> this<00:03:56.689> could<00:03:56.930> layer

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
top and try to avoid the twigs in the

top and try to avoid the twigs in the
tub<00:04:25.340> okay<00:04:26.340> so<00:04:26.520> she<00:04:27.180> actually<00:04:27.390> really<00:04:27.810> can't

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.000 
throw trash in my compost pile as well
some<00:04:34.410> of<00:04:34.440> that<00:04:36.110> all<00:04:37.110> right<00:04:37.260> we<00:04:37.530> are<00:04:37.650> ready<00:04:37.860> to

some of that all right we are ready to
hang<00:04:38.160> themselves

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.360 

so<00:04:42.090> I<00:04:42.120> took<00:04:42.240> my<00:04:42.390> my<00:04:43.350> rubber<00:04:43.590> strap<00:04:43.920> and<00:04:44.130> I<00:04:44.160> cut<00:04:44.340> a

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
so I took my my rubber strap and I cut a

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.810 
so I took my my rubber strap and I cut a
hole<00:04:44.460> in<00:04:44.820> it<00:04:44.940> and<00:04:45.770> and<00:04:46.770> I<00:04:46.860> just<00:04:47.070> tied<00:04:47.370> the<00:04:47.610> other

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
hole in it and and I just tied the other

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.940 
hole in it and and I just tied the other
end<00:04:48.030> of<00:04:48.090> the<00:04:48.180> rope<00:04:48.360> around<00:04:48.660> this<00:04:48.990> piece<00:04:49.260> I<00:04:49.500> used

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
end of the rope around this piece I used

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.310 
end of the rope around this piece I used
a<00:04:50.220> hangman's<00:04:50.670> noose<00:04:50.940> not<00:04:51.570> because<00:04:51.930> I<00:04:51.960> want<00:04:52.260> to

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
a hangman's noose not because I want to

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.080 
a hangman's noose not because I want to
emphasize<00:04:52.860> the<00:04:53.100> morbidity<00:04:53.610> of<00:04:53.640> this<00:04:53.880> whole

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
emphasize the morbidity of this whole

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.630 
emphasize the morbidity of this whole
process<00:04:54.510> but<00:04:55.380> because<00:04:56.010> it<00:04:56.130> tends<00:04:56.310> to<00:04:56.400> make<00:04:56.580> a

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
process but because it tends to make a

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.140 
process but because it tends to make a
very<00:04:56.940> tight<00:04:57.300> slip<00:04:57.690> slip<00:04:58.440> type<00:04:58.680> knot<00:04:58.920> tight<00:04:59.850> too

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
very tight slip slip type knot tight too

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.470 
very tight slip slip type knot tight too
tight<00:05:00.300> to<00:05:01.140> different<00:05:01.380> words<00:05:01.530> okay<00:05:02.340> so<00:05:02.610> so<00:05:03.390> I'm

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 
tight to different words okay so so I'm

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.260 
tight to different words okay so so I'm
just<00:05:03.630> going<00:05:03.780> to<00:05:03.810> throw<00:05:04.230> this<00:05:04.380> over<00:05:05.090> fit<00:05:06.090> the

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
just going to throw this over fit the

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.000 
just going to throw this over fit the
rest<00:05:06.420> of<00:05:06.570> the<00:05:06.630> rope<00:05:06.780> through<00:05:07.440> this<00:05:07.590> hole<00:05:07.830> and

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
rest of the rope through this hole and

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.850 
rest of the rope through this hole and
supposedly<00:05:11.600> hope<00:05:12.600> hopefully<00:05:13.050> it'll<00:05:13.470> drag

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
supposedly hope hopefully it'll drag

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.670 
supposedly hope hopefully it'll drag
this<00:05:14.100> piece<00:05:14.310> through<00:05:14.580> the<00:05:14.670> hole<00:05:14.820> -<00:05:15.650> god<00:05:16.650> I

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
this piece through the hole - god I

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.460 
this piece through the hole - god I
don't<00:05:16.830> know<00:05:17.010> I<00:05:17.040> should<00:05:17.280> test<00:05:17.460> that<00:05:17.990> and<00:05:21.470> it

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
don't know I should test that and it

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:23.900 
don't know I should test that and it
will<00:05:22.680> some<00:05:23.010> trouble<00:05:23.280> and<00:05:23.370> once<00:05:23.550> it<00:05:23.700> does<00:05:23.880> that

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
will some trouble and once it does that

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.820 
will some trouble and once it does that
then<00:05:24.480> the<00:05:24.990> rubber<00:05:25.170> should<00:05:25.440> be<00:05:25.530> around<00:05:25.710> the

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
then the rubber should be around the

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.130 
then the rubber should be around the
tree<00:05:26.010> enough<00:05:26.310> eats<00:05:26.460> for<00:05:27.390> your<00:05:27.540> amusement<00:05:27.780> I

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:28.140 
tree enough eats for your amusement I

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.690 
tree enough eats for your amusement I
expect<00:05:28.500> to<00:05:28.620> struggle<00:05:29.130> with<00:05:29.220> this<00:05:29.490> a<00:05:29.520> little

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
expect to struggle with this a little

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:39.019 
expect to struggle with this a little
bit

00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:39.029 

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:41.290

you<00:05:41.720> look<00:05:42.050> at<00:05:42.170> that

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.649 

okay<00:05:45.900> so<00:05:45.960> that<00:05:46.229> makes<00:05:46.379> a<00:05:46.560> nice<00:05:46.710> little

00:05:47.649 --> 00:05:47.659 
okay so that makes a nice little

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:50.689 
okay so that makes a nice little
protective<00:05:48.659> layer<00:05:48.900> for<00:05:49.169> the<00:05:49.259> truth<00:05:49.610> it's<00:05:50.610> a

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:50.699 
protective layer for the truth it's a

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:54.189 
protective layer for the truth it's a
very<00:05:50.940> tight<00:05:51.240> lid

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:54.199 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:57.219 

okay<00:05:55.199> so<00:05:55.259> I've<00:05:55.530> tied<00:05:55.740> this<00:05:55.889> into<00:05:56.129> the<00:05:56.220> tree

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:57.229 
okay so I've tied this into the tree

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:00.469 
okay so I've tied this into the tree
hopefully<00:05:58.229> a<00:05:58.259> tie<00:05:58.560> enough<00:05:58.800> that<00:05:59.099> the<00:05:59.909> dogs<00:06:00.210> and

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 
hopefully a tie enough that the dogs and

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:01.689 
hopefully a tie enough that the dogs and
reckonings<00:06:00.900> won't<00:06:01.110> bother

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:01.699 
reckonings won't bother

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:06.800 
reckonings won't bother
there<00:06:02.699> are<00:06:02.879> your<00:06:03.000> dogs<00:06:04.460> spread<00:06:05.460> proof<00:06:05.810> panel

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
there are your dogs spread proof panel

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.280 
there are your dogs spread proof panel
