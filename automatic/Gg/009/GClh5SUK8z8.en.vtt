you is hold left and you'll beat the
game<00:01:22.229> eventually<00:01:23.000> but<00:01:24.000> yeah<00:01:24.119> like<00:01:24.330> if<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.570> try

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
game eventually but yeah like if you try

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.170 
game eventually but yeah like if you try
to<00:01:24.869> UM<00:01:25.340> Center<00:01:26.340> out<00:01:26.460> your<00:01:26.580> jumps<00:01:26.909> there<00:01:27.060> you're

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
to UM Center out your jumps there you're

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.310 
to UM Center out your jumps there you're
not<00:01:27.450> gonna<00:01:27.600> have<00:01:27.720> enough<00:01:27.869> momentum<00:01:28.020> and

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
not gonna have enough momentum and

like spinning on these tracks back and
forth<00:03:16.959> you<00:03:17.590> got<00:03:17.739> to<00:03:17.829> make<00:03:17.920> sure<00:03:18.040> you<00:03:18.160> shoot

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
into the next one up at the right time

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.259 
into the next one up at the right time
otherwise<00:03:20.950> you<00:03:21.220> like<00:03:21.519> miss<00:03:21.730> it<00:03:21.910> and<00:03:22.000> junk<00:03:22.209> like

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
otherwise you like miss it and junk like

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:23.039 
otherwise you like miss it and junk like
that

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
that

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.349 
that
a<00:03:23.250> good<00:03:24.250> tip<00:03:24.459> to<00:03:24.489> remember<00:03:24.730> is<00:03:24.970> that<00:03:25.090> like<00:03:25.239> when

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:25.359 
a good tip to remember is that like when

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:26.910 
a good tip to remember is that like when
you<00:03:25.389> shoot<00:03:25.600> yourself<00:03:25.660> out<00:03:25.989> of<00:03:26.079> a<00:03:26.170> barrel<00:03:26.380> you

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
you shoot yourself out of a barrel you

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.379 
you shoot yourself out of a barrel you
kind<00:03:27.100> of<00:03:27.160> like<00:03:27.250> go<00:03:27.400> forward<00:03:27.850> and<00:03:27.940> definitely

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.389 
kind of like go forward and definitely

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:29.610 
kind of like go forward and definitely
so<00:03:28.569> if<00:03:28.630> you<00:03:28.750> shoot<00:03:28.959> yourself<00:03:29.049> a<00:03:29.319> little<00:03:29.530> bit

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
so if you shoot yourself a little bit

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.789 
so if you shoot yourself a little bit
early<00:03:30.069> chances<00:03:31.030> are<00:03:31.269> you'll<00:03:32.019> always<00:03:32.200> land<00:03:32.650> in

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
early chances are you'll always land in

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:34.319 
early chances are you'll always land in
the<00:03:32.859> next<00:03:33.040> barrel<00:03:33.340> because<00:03:33.489> it's<00:03:33.730> moving<00:03:33.880> sort

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
the next barrel because it's moving sort

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:35.819 
the next barrel because it's moving sort
of<00:03:34.420> where<00:03:34.930> you're<00:03:35.079> going<00:03:35.139> to<00:03:35.350> be<00:03:35.440> so<00:03:35.560> yeah<00:03:35.680> like

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
of where you're going to be so yeah like

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.759 
of where you're going to be so yeah like
lead<00:03:36.040> your<00:03:36.220> shots<00:03:36.250> a<00:03:36.670> little<00:03:36.880> bit<00:03:37.440> if<00:03:38.440> you<00:03:38.620> do

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
lead your shots a little bit if you do

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:39.840 
lead your shots a little bit if you do
that<00:03:38.950> you<00:03:39.130> should<00:03:39.310> be<00:03:39.340> able<00:03:39.459> to<00:03:39.549> get<00:03:39.670> to<00:03:39.730> this

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
that you should be able to get to this

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.110 
that you should be able to get to this
part<00:03:40.350> pretty<00:03:41.350> easily<00:03:41.769> but<00:03:42.639> just<00:03:42.819> take<00:03:42.970> your

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
because it's sort of like angle yourself

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:51.970 
because it's sort of like angle yourself
correctly<00:03:50.690> like<00:03:50.930> two<00:03:51.260> or<00:03:51.380> three<00:03:51.590> seconds

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
correctly like two or three seconds

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:52.930 
correctly like two or three seconds
before<00:03:52.250> you<00:03:52.340> actually<00:03:52.430> need<00:03:52.610> to<00:03:52.760> shoot

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
before you actually need to shoot

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.870 
before you actually need to shoot
yourself<00:03:53.590> anyways<00:03:54.590> though<00:03:54.850> we<00:03:55.850> just

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
yourself anyways though we just

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.520 
yourself anyways though we just
completed<00:03:56.360> level<00:03:56.540> we<00:03:56.750> got<00:03:56.900> ourselves<00:03:57.410> this

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
completed level we got ourselves this

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.920 
completed level we got ourselves this
lovely<00:03:58.010> little<00:03:58.160> yellow<00:03:58.550> pearl<00:03:58.850> isn't<00:03:59.750> that

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
lovely little yellow pearl isn't that

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.880 
lovely little yellow pearl isn't that
just<00:04:00.290> nice<00:04:01.600> that<00:04:02.600> K<00:04:02.780> level<00:04:03.080> wasn't<00:04:03.260> too<00:04:03.590> bad<00:04:03.860> I

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
just nice that K level wasn't too bad I

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.280 
just nice that K level wasn't too bad I
mean<00:04:04.220> the<00:04:04.640> handicaps<00:04:05.120> certainly<00:04:05.690> helped<00:04:06.140> out

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
mean the handicaps certainly helped out

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.170 
mean the handicaps certainly helped out
so<00:04:06.650> I'm<00:04:07.070> not<00:04:07.250> gonna<00:04:07.400> say<00:04:07.580> that<00:04:07.700> it<00:04:07.790> was<00:04:07.880> pure

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
so I'm not gonna say that it was pure

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.830 
so I'm not gonna say that it was pure
