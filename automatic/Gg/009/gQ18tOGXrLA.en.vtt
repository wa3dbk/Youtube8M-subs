00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.479
 For 20 years you are required in 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.670
 Germany child seats since the beginning 

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:12.820
 the adac tests the different ones 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.860
 models and is now moving in 2013 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.750
 positive balance 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.700
 the child seats are much safer 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.840
 become both at the frontal as well 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.940
 at the side impact 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.830
 the installation is also a very important one 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.800
 become easier in particular by 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.690
 the isofix child seats and in the 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.940
 Last years is also the 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:33.100
 pollutant content has become less 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.070
 means the children have definitely 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.469
 Advantages of the new products 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.149
 Currently, the adac has 27 children's sets 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:42.969
 All weight classes tested 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:46.059
 the result for every child is good 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:47.589
 Products no matter how old the child is and 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:48.460
 Security should continue in the future 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:50.890
 climb 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.620
 a new guideline should help 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.629
 after the middle of the year child seats 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.089
 manufactured and tested 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.249
 This is not new in this directive 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:02.050
 only completed a frontal impact test 

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:04.089
 must be but finally one 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.260
 Side impact test that is the sentences 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.910
 have a specific one 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.920
 offer side impact protection 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.600
 new is also that the children are you 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.060
 no longer divided into weight classes 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.740
 But you have to be by the size 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.230
 of the child 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.170
 and new is also that in these new ones 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.730
 children up to 15 months always 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.390
 strapped against the direction of travel 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.840
 Need to become 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.130
 that means first for older children 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.780
 may this be rotated first now 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.000
 older children are allowed to look forward 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.680
 the advantage of a backward- looking 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.200
 Child sitting is the protection when 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.420
 frontal impact the loads for the head 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.100
 and neck are much lower because 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.230
 the child with the whole body in the 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.550
 seat is pressed 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.710
 However, it is difficult for the child 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.540
 to get into the seat or for the 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.850
 Parents when they put the child in the seat 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.160
 the children also want to lift 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:55.380
 relatively little space for the legs and 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:57.970
 the installation also has its pitfalls 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.560
 isofix childcare is the installation in 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.270
 usually much easier than 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.720
 attendant with the car seat installed 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.700
 become 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.290
 this is especially true for the 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.180
 backward child sitting 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.369
 that means for the backwards 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.799
 directed child seat here becomes one 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.030
 isofix base clicked into the vehicle 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:15.980
 This is very fast and easy 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.569
 The seat itself is also easy 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.209
 just put on and locked 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.490
 there are no additional straps and 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.470
 no additional tension necessary 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.870
 that now a backward 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.640
 child seat for larger children the 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.100
 installed opposite to the direction of travel 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.750
 the child seat can be exclusive 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.580
 with the vehicle and be attached 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.980
 So that means the autogurt must 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.170
 be performed and are additional 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.239
 even more straps necessary with those 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.770
 is of sitting on front seat guyed 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:48.560
 By this installation, it is relatively 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.900
 elaborate error-prone and yes one 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.000
 little harder than children's sentences 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.739
 which are grown with isofix no matter for 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.320
 which kind of child seat parents 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:01.150
 Decide best with child and car 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.150
 in the specialty because only then
