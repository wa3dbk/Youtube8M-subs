00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
all right this is a tutorial on how to

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.490 
all right this is a tutorial on how to
use<00:00:04.049> a<00:00:04.589> flash<00:00:05.279> card<00:00:05.549> for<00:00:05.819> the<00:00:06.000> DS<00:00:06.299> Lite<00:00:06.569> alright

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
use a flash card for the DS Lite alright

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.620 
use a flash card for the DS Lite alright
so<00:00:07.740> we<00:00:07.980> have<00:00:08.010> here<00:00:08.280> we<00:00:08.490> have<00:00:08.519> the<00:00:08.730> DES<00:00:08.970> unit<00:00:09.450> and

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
so we have here we have the DES unit and

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.080 
so we have here we have the DES unit and
we<00:00:09.809> have<00:00:09.929> already<00:00:10.200> installed<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:11.280> flash<00:00:11.790> card

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
we have already installed the flash card

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.879 
we have already installed the flash card
into<00:00:12.389> it<00:00:12.480> so<00:00:12.809> that's<00:00:13.049> actually<00:00:13.170> located<00:00:13.740> on

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
into it so that's actually located on

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.220 
into it so that's actually located on
the<00:00:13.980> back<00:00:14.160> part<00:00:14.429> right<00:00:14.610> here<00:00:14.910> alright<00:00:15.780> so<00:00:15.900> to

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
the back part right here alright so to

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.880 
the back part right here alright so to
simply<00:00:16.859> take<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.910> card<00:00:18.180> out<00:00:18.330> is<00:00:18.869> present<00:00:19.470> it

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
simply take the card out is present it

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.429 
simply take the card out is present it
will<00:00:20.070> pop<00:00:20.310> out<00:00:20.490> like<00:00:20.520> that<00:00:20.970> alright<00:00:21.390> so<00:00:22.260> what<00:00:22.410> I

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
will pop out like that alright so what I

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.560 
will pop out like that alright so what I
to<00:00:22.590> get<00:00:22.800> installed<00:00:23.039> here<00:00:23.310> is<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.519> flash<00:00:24.210> card

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
to get installed here is a flash card

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.080 
to get installed here is a flash card
called<00:00:24.990> ace<00:00:25.350> card<00:00:25.740> -<00:00:26.130> alright

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
called ace card - alright

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.050 
called ace card - alright
and<00:00:27.320> most<00:00:28.320> flash<00:00:28.529> cards<00:00:28.949> they<00:00:29.279> look<00:00:29.820> similar

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
and most flash cards they look similar

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.870 
and most flash cards they look similar
to<00:00:30.179> this<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.800> they<00:00:31.800> perform<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.430> same<00:00:32.610> thing

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
to this and they perform the same thing

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.990 
to this and they perform the same thing
the<00:00:33.480> only<00:00:33.570> difference<00:00:34.079> between<00:00:34.350> those<00:00:35.000> some

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
the only difference between those some

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.290 
the only difference between those some
memory<00:00:36.780> cards<00:00:37.320> they<00:00:37.559> cannot<00:00:38.070> take<00:00:38.399> certain

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
memory cards they cannot take certain

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.840 
memory cards they cannot take certain
sizes<00:00:40.050> or<00:00:40.260> certain<00:00:40.829> brands<00:00:41.129> work<00:00:41.399> better<00:00:41.579> than

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
sizes or certain brands work better than

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:42.139 
sizes or certain brands work better than
others

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
others

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.310 
others
so<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:43.500> will<00:00:43.829> have<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.670> guess<00:00:44.879> add<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.390> link<00:00:45.960> on

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
so I will have to I guess add a link on

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.510 
so I will have to I guess add a link on
to<00:00:46.680> how<00:00:47.480> or<00:00:48.480> actually<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.989> link<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.250> webpage

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
to how or actually a link to a webpage

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.569 
to how or actually a link to a webpage
statute<00:00:51.149> tells<00:00:51.949> which<00:00:52.949> ones<00:00:53.129> are<00:00:53.250> compatible

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
statute tells which ones are compatible

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.729 
statute tells which ones are compatible
with<00:00:53.820> which<00:00:54.120> alright<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.379> what<00:00:55.710> a

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
with which alright so this is what a

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:56.689 
with which alright so this is what a
flash<00:00:55.949> card<00:00:56.250> looks<00:00:56.460> like

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
flash card looks like

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.180 
flash card looks like
alright<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.660> just<00:00:57.690> looks<00:00:57.989> like<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.170> regular<00:00:58.559> DS

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
alright it just looks like a regular DS

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.250 
alright it just looks like a regular DS
cartridge<00:00:59.820> except<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.660> has<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.809> little<00:01:01.020> memory

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
cartridge except it has a little memory

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.070 
cartridge except it has a little memory
card<00:01:01.410> right<00:01:01.770> here<00:01:01.980> which<00:01:02.879> is<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.030> micro<00:01:03.359> SD<00:01:03.809> card

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
card right here which is a micro SD card

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.690 
card right here which is a micro SD card
alright<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:04.920> take<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.909> out<00:01:06.049> it's<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.700> simple

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
alright so take that out it's a simple

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.060 
alright so take that out it's a simple
as<00:01:08.880> push<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:09.990> in<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.530> will<00:01:10.590> pop<00:01:10.799> out<00:01:10.979> with

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
as push it in and it will pop out with

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.730 
as push it in and it will pop out with
that<00:01:11.250> all<00:01:11.580> right<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.810> can<00:01:12.869> use<00:01:13.260> basically

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
that all right so you can use basically

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.580 
that all right so you can use basically
I<00:01:14.040> have<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.700> Santa<00:01:16.280> skandhas<00:01:17.600> micro<00:01:18.600> SD<00:01:19.320> card

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
I have a Santa skandhas micro SD card

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.670 
I have a Santa skandhas micro SD card
sorry<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.670> just<00:01:20.970> 2<00:01:21.360> gigabytes<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.380> forgot

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
sorry and I just 2 gigabytes so I forgot

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.170 
sorry and I just 2 gigabytes so I forgot
how<00:01:22.830> many<00:01:22.890> games<00:01:23.220> are<00:01:23.340> usually<00:01:23.490> fits<00:01:23.880> is

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
how many games are usually fits is

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.390 
how many games are usually fits is
probably<00:01:24.509> about<00:01:24.630> 14<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.530> them<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:26.040> totally

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
probably about 14 of them it totally

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.060 
probably about 14 of them it totally
depends<00:01:26.700> on<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.409> games<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.619> found<00:01:28.890> it

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
depends on the games that you found it

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.580 
depends on the games that you found it
so<00:01:29.100> for<00:01:29.460> example<00:01:29.790> Final<00:01:30.119> Fantasy<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.960> those

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
so for example Final Fantasy and those

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
so for example Final Fantasy and those
long<00:01:32.460> RPG<00:01:33.090> type<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.450> games<00:01:33.600> they<00:01:33.840> are<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.990> lot

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
long RPG type of games they are a lot

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.929 
long RPG type of games they are a lot
more<00:01:35.610> memory<00:01:35.880> intensive<00:01:36.299> than<00:01:36.689> let's<00:01:36.960> say<00:01:37.020> a

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
more memory intensive than let's say a

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.960 
more memory intensive than let's say a
brain<00:01:38.939> age<00:01:39.240> type<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.869> game<00:01:40.049> so<00:01:40.880> depending<00:01:41.880> on

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
brain age type of game so depending on

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.139 
brain age type of game so depending on
what<00:01:42.150> kind<00:01:42.299> of<00:01:42.390> games<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.810> have<00:01:43.700> it<00:01:44.700> can<00:01:44.909> vary

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
what kind of games you have it can vary

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.109 
what kind of games you have it can vary
how<00:01:45.299> many<00:01:45.479> times<00:01:46.009> with<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.130> squared<00:01:47.579> -<00:01:47.790> and

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
how many times with the a squared - and

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.960 
how many times with the a squared - and
specifically<00:01:49.189> it<00:01:50.189> can<00:01:50.340> actually<00:01:50.579> hold<00:01:51.380> a

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
specifically it can actually hold a

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.219 
specifically it can actually hold a
actually<00:01:53.970> support<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.450> think<00:01:54.689> up<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.840> 8

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
actually support I think up to 8

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:01.730 
actually support I think up to 8
gigabytes<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:56.719> high<00:01:57.719> density<00:02:00.140> SD<00:02:01.140> card

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
gigabytes of high density SD card

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.149 
gigabytes of high density SD card
memories<00:02:02.219> for<00:02:03.180> example<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.689> r4<00:02:04.229> is<00:02:04.590> since<00:02:05.040> the

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
memories for example the r4 is since the

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.709 
memories for example the r4 is since the
older<00:02:05.490> technology<00:02:05.969> only<00:02:06.149> can<00:02:06.450> handle

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
older technology only can handle

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.080 
older technology only can handle
probably<00:02:07.170> up<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.320> 2<00:02:07.619> gigs<00:02:08.099> or<00:02:08.310> maybe<00:02:08.729> even<00:02:09.000> just

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
probably up to 2 gigs or maybe even just

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.449 
probably up to 2 gigs or maybe even just
one<00:02:09.360> gig<00:02:09.629> of<00:02:09.780> regular<00:02:10.229> memory<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.250> have<00:02:11.400> to

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.240 
then just simply drag and drop from one
to<00:03:23.550> the<00:03:23.640> disk<00:03:24.560> it's<00:03:25.560> almost<00:03:25.860> just<00:03:25.950> a<00:03:26.130> good

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
to the disk it's almost just a good

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.220 
to the disk it's almost just a good
flash<00:03:26.460> drive<00:03:26.760> so<00:03:27.090> that's<00:03:27.750> officially<00:03:28.020> what<00:03:28.110> it

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
flash drive so that's officially what it

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.050 
flash drive so that's officially what it
is<00:03:28.350> here<00:03:28.560> so<00:03:29.160> once<00:03:29.340> you<00:03:29.430> have<00:03:29.490> download

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
is here so once you have download

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.030 
is here so once you have download
download<00:03:30.360> to<00:03:30.660> the<00:03:30.750> games<00:03:30.900> just<00:03:31.020> unzip<00:03:31.890> them

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
download to the games just unzip them

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.190 
download to the games just unzip them
and<00:03:32.340> dump<00:03:33.300> the<00:03:33.570> rom<00:03:33.780> files<00:03:34.190> onto<00:03:35.190> here<00:03:35.520> and<00:03:36.200> I

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
and dump the rom files onto here and I

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.410 
and dump the rom files onto here and I
believe<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:38.190> file<00:03:38.370> extension<00:03:38.940> should<00:03:39.210> be<00:03:39.390> a

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
believe the file extension should be a

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.600 
believe the file extension should be a
dot<00:03:39.870> NDS<00:03:40.560> so<00:03:41.370> it<00:03:41.730> should<00:03:41.940> be<00:03:42.060> okay<00:03:42.360> that<00:03:42.840> way

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
dot NDS so it should be okay that way

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.940 
dot NDS so it should be okay that way
other<00:03:44.610> than<00:03:44.760> that<00:03:45.180> that<00:03:45.630> should<00:03:45.930> be<00:03:46.320> basically

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
other than that that should be basically

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.680 
other than that that should be basically
the<00:03:47.130> principles<00:03:47.610> of<00:03:47.850> having<00:03:48.180> an<00:03:48.300> SD<00:03:48.540> memory
