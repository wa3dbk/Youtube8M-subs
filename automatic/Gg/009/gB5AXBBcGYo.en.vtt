doing<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:37.680> badly<00:00:38.040> it's<00:00:38.340> done<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.610> little<00:00:38.879> bit

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
doing that badly it's done a little bit

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.760 
doing that badly it's done a little bit
but<00:00:39.360> it's<00:00:39.570> fallen<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:40.050> lot<00:00:40.230> less<00:00:40.469> than

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
but it's fallen a lot less than

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.930 
but it's fallen a lot less than
everything<00:00:41.040> else<00:00:41.340> which<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:41.879> think

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
everything else which is I think

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.819 
everything else which is I think
remarkable<00:00:42.660> given<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.020> deleveraging<00:00:43.379> that's

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
remarkable given the deleveraging that's

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.340 
remarkable given the deleveraging that's
going<00:00:44.100> on<00:00:45.020> understand<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.079> point<00:00:46.230> you're

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
going on understand the point you're

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.639 
going on understand the point you're
making<00:00:46.469> but<00:00:47.010> if<00:00:47.270> you<00:00:48.270> look<00:00:48.600> at<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.809> flow<00:00:49.620> of

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
making but if you look at the flow of

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.229 
making but if you look at the flow of
news<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.070> we've<00:00:50.370> had<00:00:50.489> in<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.700> last<00:00:50.730> three

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
news that we've had in the last three

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.880 
news that we've had in the last three
months<00:00:51.420> or<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.260> would<00:00:52.530> have<00:00:52.559> thought<00:00:52.829> that

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
months or so you would have thought that

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.750 
months or so you would have thought that
gold<00:00:53.550> at<00:00:53.879> least<00:00:54.270> as<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.510> safe<00:00:54.809> haven<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.760> port

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
gold at least as a safe haven and a port

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.750 
gold at least as a safe haven and a port
in<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:57.000> storm<00:00:57.030> would<00:00:58.020> still<00:00:58.410> be<00:00:58.770> higher<00:00:59.219> than<00:00:59.609> it

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
in a storm would still be higher than it

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.220 
in a storm would still be higher than it
is<00:00:59.910> currently<00:01:00.120> well<00:01:00.629> it's<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.840> two<00:01:01.020> step

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
is currently well it's a two step

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.510 
is currently well it's a two step
process<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.920> first<00:01:02.129> step<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.489> to

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
process the first step is to

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.189 
process the first step is to
deleveraging<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.449> then<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.660> second<00:01:04.019> thing

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
deleveraging and then the second thing

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.780 
deleveraging and then the second thing
is<00:01:04.320> once<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.650> get<00:01:04.830> liquid<00:01:05.220> where<00:01:05.430> do<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.610> put

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
is once you get liquid where do you put

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.490 
is once you get liquid where do you put
your<00:01:05.820> money<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.780> think<00:01:06.869> what<00:01:07.140> we've<00:01:07.260> seen

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
your money and I think what we've seen

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.710 
your money and I think what we've seen
now<00:01:07.710> as<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.920> base<00:01:08.220> being<00:01:08.520> built<00:01:08.820> in<00:01:09.000> golden<00:01:09.540> I

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
now as a base being built in golden I

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.630 
now as a base being built in golden I
think<00:01:10.049> we<00:01:10.140> can<00:01:10.290> expect<00:01:10.650> higher<00:01:10.860> prices<00:01:11.340> next

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
think we can expect higher prices next

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.580 
think we can expect higher prices next
year<00:01:11.840> after<00:01:12.840> all<00:01:12.869> there's<00:01:13.140> very<00:01:13.350> little

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
year after all there's very little

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.350 
year after all there's very little
incentive<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:14.310> hold<00:01:14.460> dollars<00:01:14.850> on<00:01:15.150> an

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
incentive to hold dollars on an

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.539 
incentive to hold dollars on an
inflation<00:01:15.960> adjusted<00:01:16.470> basis<00:01:16.920> interest<00:01:17.369> rates

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
inflation adjusted basis interest rates

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.399 
inflation adjusted basis interest rates
are<00:01:17.729> negative<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.570> lose<00:01:18.720> purchasing<00:01:19.259> power

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
are negative you lose purchasing power

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.530 
are negative you lose purchasing power
by<00:01:19.590> holding<00:01:19.890> just<00:01:20.400> about<00:01:20.520> any<00:01:20.729> currency<00:01:21.150> these

by holding just about any currency these

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.539 
by holding just about any currency these
days<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:22.020> gold<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.710> attractive<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.400> there's

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
days so gold is attractive and there's

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.300 
days so gold is attractive and there's
the<00:01:23.670> counterparty<00:01:24.630> risk<00:01:24.659> when<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.070> hold<00:01:26.070> gold

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
the counterparty risk when you hold gold

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.429 
the counterparty risk when you hold gold
as<00:01:26.490> well<00:01:26.520> but<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.780> really<00:01:27.869> counterparty

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
as well but is it really counterparty

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.539 
as well but is it really counterparty
risk<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.680> mean<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:28.860> seems<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:29.340> that

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
risk I mean it seems that that that

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.280 
risk I mean it seems that that that
we're<00:01:29.700> looking<00:01:30.000> at<00:01:30.119> or<00:01:30.689> whether<00:01:31.079> we're

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
is out with the other commodities

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.440 
is out with the other commodities
because<00:02:21.700> they're<00:02:21.790> all<00:02:21.880> competing<00:02:22.120> for<00:02:22.300> the

because they're all competing for the

because they're all competing for the
same<00:02:22.600> type<00:02:22.810> of<00:02:22.840> thing<00:02:22.960> do<00:02:23.200> you<00:02:23.290> see<00:02:23.440> that<00:02:23.650> any

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
same type of thing do you see that any

movements<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:24.520> the<00:02:24.580> other<00:02:24.730> commodities<00:02:25.180> are

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
movements and the other commodities are

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.030 
movements and the other commodities are
going<00:02:25.360> to<00:02:25.420> affect<00:02:25.480> goal<00:02:25.720> you<00:02:26.680> know<00:02:26.800> that's<00:02:26.950> a

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
going to affect goal you know that's a

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.890 
going to affect goal you know that's a
good<00:02:27.070> question<00:02:27.220> that<00:02:28.150> I<00:02:28.180> think<00:02:28.270> that<00:02:28.540> depends

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
good question that I think that depends

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.110 
good question that I think that depends
a<00:02:28.960> large<00:02:29.200> extent<00:02:29.560> to<00:02:29.770> what<00:02:30.160> whether<00:02:30.910> the

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
a large extent to what whether the

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.330 
a large extent to what whether the
leveraging<00:02:31.690> is<00:02:31.870> over<00:02:32.170> in<00:02:32.320> the<00:02:32.530> hedge<00:02:32.710> funds<00:02:33.100> I

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
leveraging is over in the hedge funds I

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.040 
leveraging is over in the hedge funds I
think<00:02:33.820> we've<00:02:33.940> seen<00:02:34.060> a<00:02:34.120> massive<00:02:34.480> sell-off<00:02:34.900> in

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
think we've seen a massive sell-off in

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.750 
think we've seen a massive sell-off in
commodities<00:02:35.770> because<00:02:36.130> of<00:02:36.310> that<00:02:36.430> deleveraging

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
commodities because of that deleveraging

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.300 
commodities because of that deleveraging
and<00:02:37.240> we<00:02:37.690> now<00:02:37.840> have<00:02:37.870> to<00:02:38.050> get<00:02:38.260> back<00:02:38.410> to<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.710> real

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
and we now have to get back to the real

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.180 
and we now have to get back to the real
economic<00:02:39.670> demand<00:02:40.360> for<00:02:40.570> those<00:02:40.690> commodities<00:02:41.190> my

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
economic demand for those commodities my

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.890 
economic demand for those commodities my
guess<00:02:42.400> is<00:02:42.430> that<00:02:42.820> gold<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:43.420> other<00:02:43.540> commodities

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
guess is that gold and other commodities

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.510 
guess is that gold and other commodities
next<00:02:44.530> year<00:02:44.680> going<00:02:44.830> to<00:02:44.920> go<00:02:45.040> up<00:02:45.130> pretty<00:02:45.340> much

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
next year going to go up pretty much

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.520 
next year going to go up pretty much
together<00:02:45.790> it's<00:02:46.750> interesting<00:02:47.020> one<00:02:47.350> of<00:02:47.440> the

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
together it's interesting one of the

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.290 
together it's interesting one of the
things<00:02:47.710> I<00:02:47.800> look<00:02:47.980> at<00:02:48.160> is<00:02:48.310> the<00:02:48.550> price<00:02:48.850> of<00:02:49.090> crude

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
things I look at is the price of crude

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.450 
things I look at is the price of crude
oil<00:02:49.480> in<00:02:49.690> terms<00:02:49.900> of<00:02:50.110> gold<00:02:50.380> and<00:02:50.620> while<00:02:51.130> it<00:02:51.280> looks

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
oil in terms of gold and while it looks

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.550 
oil in terms of gold and while it looks
expensive<00:02:51.790> in<00:02:52.120> terms<00:02:52.380> krewella<00:02:53.380> looks

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
expensive in terms krewella looks

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.080 
expensive in terms krewella looks
expensive<00:02:53.830> in<00:02:54.130> terms<00:02:54.160> of<00:02:54.430> dollars<00:02:54.760> or<00:02:54.940> pounds

an ounce of gold today supplies the same

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
amount of crude oil I did 50 or 60 years

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.320 
amount of crude oil I did 50 or 60 years
ago<00:02:59.470> so<00:03:00.250> gold<00:03:00.520> holds<00:03:00.760> its<00:03:00.880> purchasing<00:03:01.300> power
