00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
experiment as part of your short

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.960 
experiment as part of your short
response<00:02:42.549> answer<00:02:43.889> so<00:02:44.889> your<00:02:45.250> scientific

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
response answer so your scientific

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.289 
response answer so your scientific
experiment<00:02:46.720> should<00:02:47.019> include<00:02:47.590> a<00:02:47.950> clear

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
experiment should include a clear

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:53.920 
experiment should include a clear
hypothesis

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.559 

you<00:02:54.829> will<00:02:54.980> then<00:02:55.220> need<00:02:55.459> to<00:02:55.670> create<00:02:56.030> a<00:02:56.209> well

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
you will then need to create a well

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.589 
you will then need to create a well
organized<00:02:57.290> and<00:02:57.680> formulated<00:02:58.430> design<00:02:58.790> that

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
organized and formulated design that

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:02.530 
organized and formulated design that
tells<00:02:59.930> how<00:03:00.349> the<00:03:00.459> experiment<00:03:01.459> could<00:03:02.180> be

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
tells how the experiment could be

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:11.920 
tells how the experiment could be
conducted<00:03:09.010> next<00:03:10.010> you<00:03:10.400> should<00:03:11.090> suggest<00:03:11.450> a

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
conducted next you should suggest a

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:18.210 
conducted next you should suggest a
logical<00:03:12.560> method<00:03:12.950> for<00:03:13.220> collecting<00:03:13.370> data<00:03:16.870> and

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
logical method for collecting data and

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.979 
logical method for collecting data and
finally<00:03:19.220> you<00:03:19.579> should<00:03:19.609> also<00:03:19.970> include<00:03:20.180> what

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
finally you should also include what

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.770
