idea<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.340> will<00:00:32.700> explain<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.510> in<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.840> second

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
idea I will explain to you in a second

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.620 
idea I will explain to you in a second
first<00:00:35.010> we<00:00:35.250> need<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.489> address<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.000> problems<00:00:36.480> we

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
first we need to address the problems we

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.360 
first we need to address the problems we
had<00:00:36.750> with<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.020> breeding<00:00:37.290> first<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:37.980> all<00:00:38.160> we

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
had with the breeding first of all we

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.700 
had with the breeding first of all we
got<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.579> cool-down<00:00:39.260> secondly<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.290> cool-down

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
got a cool-down secondly a cool-down

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.850 
got a cool-down secondly a cool-down
that<00:00:41.070> means<00:00:41.280> we<00:00:41.460> can't<00:00:41.700> spam<00:00:42.180> breed<00:00:42.480> anymore

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
that means we can't spam breed anymore

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.020 
that means we can't spam breed anymore
secondly<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:43.980> was<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.160> problem<00:00:44.460> when<00:00:44.879> we<00:00:45.000> were

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
secondly it was a problem when we were

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.930 
secondly it was a problem when we were
holding<00:00:45.450> our<00:00:45.989> animals<00:00:46.980> here<00:00:47.190> in<00:00:47.250> those<00:00:47.550> mine

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
holding our animals here in those mine

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.290 
holding our animals here in those mine
carts<00:00:48.390> when<00:00:48.989> we<00:00:49.170> locked<00:00:49.500> out<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.520> they

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
carts when we locked out and in they

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.970 
carts when we locked out and in they
jumped<00:00:51.660> out<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.960> minecart<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.770> was<00:00:52.949> a

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
jumped out of the minecart so it was a

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.410 
jumped out of the minecart so it was a
problem<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.489> know<00:00:53.610> we<00:00:53.760> have<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.030> keep<00:00:54.210> them

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
problem you know we have to keep them

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.139 
problem you know we have to keep them
moving<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:55.199> stuff<00:00:55.440> like<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:56.149> pretty

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
moving and stuff like that pretty

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:57.889 
moving and stuff like that pretty
complicated

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
complicated

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.900 
complicated
I<00:00:57.989> have<00:00:58.170> holding<00:00:58.649> dales<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.039> picked<00:00:59.280> up<00:00:59.460> dents

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
I have holding dales and picked up dents

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.819 
I have holding dales and picked up dents
and<00:01:00.180> picked<00:01:00.390> them<00:01:00.539> up<00:01:00.660> from<00:01:00.870> there<00:01:01.170> but<00:01:01.680> with

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
and picked them up from there but with

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.889 
and picked them up from there but with
this<00:01:02.010> design<00:01:02.430> it's<00:01:02.699> possible<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.449> store<00:01:03.690> them

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
this design it's possible to store them

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.980 
this design it's possible to store them
in<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.140> pretty<00:01:04.619> compact<00:01:05.519> way<00:01:05.850> basically<00:01:06.689> you

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
in a pretty compact way basically you

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.640 
in a pretty compact way basically you
can<00:01:07.080> stack<00:01:07.350> up<00:01:07.530> it's<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.860> modular<00:01:08.220> design<00:01:08.250> and

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
can stack up it's a modular design and

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.710 
can stack up it's a modular design and
let's<00:01:10.650> quickly<00:01:10.890> demonstrate<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.760> so<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.330> got

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
let's quickly demonstrate it so I got

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.570 
let's quickly demonstrate it so I got
the<00:01:12.869> animals<00:01:13.320> in<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.590> holding<00:01:13.950> cells<00:01:14.220> here

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
the animals in the holding cells here

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.999 
the animals in the holding cells here
and<00:01:14.670> on<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.270> backside<00:01:15.720> half<00:01:15.990> my<00:01:16.259> contacts

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
and on the backside half my contacts

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.210 
and on the backside half my contacts
were<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.400> know<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.580> activate<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.509> Anglia

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
were you know to activate the Anglia

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.399 
were you know to activate the Anglia
extraction<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.369> animals<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.119> could

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
extraction of the animals you could

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.330 
extraction of the animals you could
right<00:01:22.409> now<00:01:22.439> it's<00:01:22.770> all<00:01:22.920> hooked<00:01:23.159> up

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
right now it's all hooked up

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.270 
right now it's all hooked up
individually<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.330> know<00:01:24.509> for<00:01:25.259> test<00:01:25.530> purposes

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
individually you know for test purposes

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.539 
individually you know for test purposes
later<00:01:26.610> on<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:27.000> will<00:01:27.150> automate<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.080> system

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
later on you will automate the system

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.060 
later on you will automate the system
with<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.579> clock<00:01:30.060> or<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.020> memory<00:01:31.439> cell<00:01:31.890> or

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
with a clock or a memory cell or

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.429 
with a clock or a memory cell or
something<00:01:32.250> I'm<00:01:32.729> not<00:01:33.000> quite<00:01:33.270> sure<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:34.110> then<00:01:34.290> you

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
something I'm not quite sure so then you

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.280 
something I'm not quite sure so then you
could<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:35.100> know<00:01:35.220> get<00:01:35.460> your<00:01:35.640> animals<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.290> send

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
could you know get your animals and send

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.230 
could you know get your animals and send
them<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.470> your<00:01:37.740> breeding<00:01:37.979> cell<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.640> if<00:01:39.090> you're

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
them to your breeding cell and if you're

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.910 
them to your breeding cell and if you're
done<00:01:39.420> with<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.750> breeding<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.290> just<00:01:40.650> sent

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
done with the breeding you just sent

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.560 
done with the breeding you just sent
them<00:01:41.070> back<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:41.549> so<00:01:42.210> okay<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:43.409> is<00:01:43.590> okay

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
them back in so okay that is okay

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.539 
them back in so okay that is okay
nothing<00:01:45.570> spectacular<00:01:45.930> but<00:01:46.500> there<00:01:46.920> comes<00:01:47.130> the

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
nothing spectacular but there comes the

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.300 
nothing spectacular but there comes the
clever<00:01:47.850> part<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.360> this<00:01:48.540> design<00:01:49.170> if<00:01:49.770> we<00:01:50.070> lock

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
clever part of this design if we lock

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.280 
clever part of this design if we lock
out<00:01:50.579> now<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.270> was<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.600> problem<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.229> I

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
out now and that was the problem and I

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.749 
out now and that was the problem and I
will<00:01:52.439> demonstrate<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.189> right<00:01:53.520> now

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
will demonstrate to you right now

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.240 
will demonstrate to you right now
logging<00:01:54.570> out<00:01:55.100> logging<00:01:56.100> back<00:01:56.280> in<00:01:56.840> so<00:01:58.130> there<00:01:59.130> you

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
logging out logging back in so there you

all the way no that is bad if you jump
into<00:02:21.180> cards<00:02:22.050> we'll<00:02:22.170> have<00:02:22.260> to<00:02:22.410> be<00:02:22.530> careful

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
into cards we'll have to be careful

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.510 
into cards we'll have to be careful
I<00:02:23.220> jumped<00:02:24.210> all<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.360> way<00:02:24.510> down<00:02:24.840> but<00:02:25.560> yeah<00:02:25.830> you

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
I jumped all the way down but yeah you

I jumped all the way down but yeah you
can<00:02:26.700> see<00:02:26.970> I<00:02:27.270> waited<00:02:27.990> there<00:02:28.140> too<00:02:28.410> and<00:02:28.890> there

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
can see I waited there too and there

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.360 
can see I waited there too and there
yeah<00:02:29.730> let<00:02:30.090> me<00:02:30.240> quickly<00:02:30.420> get<00:02:30.810> them<00:02:31.020> out<00:02:31.370> that

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
yeah let me quickly get them out that

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.130 
yeah let me quickly get them out that
happens<00:02:32.730> sometimes<00:02:32.940> in<00:02:33.360> creative<00:02:33.750> mode<00:02:33.780> you

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
happens sometimes in creative mode you

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.450 
happens sometimes in creative mode you
saw<00:02:34.320> how<00:02:34.470> it<00:02:34.500> glitched<00:02:34.920> through<00:02:35.070> the<00:02:35.340> whole

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
saw how it glitched through the whole

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.900 
saw how it glitched through the whole
thing<00:02:35.940> but<00:02:36.480> you<00:02:36.540> see<00:02:37.020> the<00:02:37.800> sheep<00:02:38.310> are<00:02:38.520> still

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
thing but you see the sheep are still

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.700 
thing but you see the sheep are still
contained<00:02:39.450> and<00:02:39.810> they<00:02:40.080> are<00:02:40.140> sitting<00:02:40.500> in<00:02:40.620> the

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
contained and they are sitting in the

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.850 
contained and they are sitting in the
minecart<00:02:41.160> now<00:02:42.030> it<00:02:42.420> works<00:02:43.020> with<00:02:43.200> cows<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.800> pigs

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
minecart now it works with cows and pigs

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.800 
minecart now it works with cows and pigs
for<00:02:44.310> sure<00:02:44.520> you<00:02:44.940> could<00:02:45.120> even<00:02:45.270> use<00:02:45.510> it<00:02:45.540> for

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
for sure you could even use it for

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.140 
for sure you could even use it for
chicken<00:02:46.650> but<00:02:47.040> I<00:02:47.070> don't<00:02:47.370> know<00:02:47.520> if<00:02:47.700> it's<00:02:47.880> really

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
chicken but I don't know if it's really

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.780 
chicken but I don't know if it's really
useful<00:02:48.570> yeah<00:02:49.080> and<00:02:49.320> it<00:02:49.410> works<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.980> idea<00:02:50.550> behind

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
useful yeah and it works the idea behind

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.240 
useful yeah and it works the idea behind
it<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:51.390> that<00:02:51.420> is<00:02:51.660> really<00:02:52.110> clever<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:52.680> that

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
it and that is really clever and that

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.030 
it and that is really clever and that
was<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.580> idea<00:02:53.610> of<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.810> zoom<00:02:55.020> avoid<00:02:55.350> and<00:02:55.680> I

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
was the idea of the zoom avoid and I

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.490 
was the idea of the zoom avoid and I
just<00:02:56.340> made<00:02:56.550> it<00:02:56.580> into<00:02:56.850> that<00:02:57.150> design<00:02:57.720> you<00:02:58.080> can

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
just made it into that design you can

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.830 
just made it into that design you can
see<00:02:58.680> right<00:02:58.860> here<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.940> minecart<00:03:00.360> is<00:03:00.480> sitting

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
see right here the minecart is sitting

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.730 
see right here the minecart is sitting
there<00:03:01.730> as<00:03:02.730> brakes<00:03:03.570> block<00:03:04.020> you<00:03:04.200> can<00:03:04.350> see<00:03:04.530> better

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
there as brakes block you can see better

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.370 
there as brakes block you can see better
is<00:03:04.890> sitting<00:03:05.220> there<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:05.840> when<00:03:06.840> you<00:03:06.960> lock<00:03:07.170> out

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
is sitting there and when you lock out

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.450 
is sitting there and when you lock out
the<00:03:07.950> Sheep<00:03:08.850> is<00:03:09.030> contained<00:03:09.510> in<00:03:09.690> here<00:03:09.930> now<00:03:10.890> when

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
the Sheep is contained in here now when

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.130 
the Sheep is contained in here now when
you<00:03:11.550> log<00:03:11.730> back<00:03:11.790> in<00:03:12.180> and<00:03:12.300> send<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:12.720> car<00:03:12.990> out

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
you log back in and send the car out

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.820 
you log back in and send the car out
this<00:03:13.440> piston<00:03:13.980> pushes<00:03:14.760> ahead<00:03:14.910> and<00:03:15.560> because<00:03:16.560> the

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
this piston pushes ahead and because the

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.440 
this piston pushes ahead and because the
animal<00:03:17.280> and<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.550> minecart<00:03:17.970> are<00:03:18.090> at<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.270> same

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
animal and the minecart are at the same

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.380 
animal and the minecart are at the same
place<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:19.050> piston<00:03:19.560> everytime<00:03:20.250> pushes<00:03:20.880> the

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
place the piston everytime pushes the

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.530 
place the piston everytime pushes the
animal<00:03:21.840> back<00:03:22.170> into<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.220> minecart<00:03:23.700> and<00:03:24.390> this

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
animal back into the minecart and this

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.300 
animal back into the minecart and this
is<00:03:24.690> how<00:03:24.810> it<00:03:24.870> works<00:03:25.080> so<00:03:25.260> actually<00:03:25.770> the<00:03:25.890> animals

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
is how it works so actually the animals

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.940 
is how it works so actually the animals
do<00:03:26.700> hop<00:03:27.330> out<00:03:27.570> of<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:27.750> Minecraft<00:03:28.170> out<00:03:28.560> if<00:03:28.770> I

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
do hop out of the Minecraft out if I

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.040 
do hop out of the Minecraft out if I
would<00:03:29.130> lock<00:03:29.370> out<00:03:29.550> now<00:03:29.850> all<00:03:30.330> of<00:03:30.660> them<00:03:30.870> would

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
would lock out now all of them would

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.199 
would lock out now all of them would
like<00:03:31.290> jump<00:03:31.800> out<00:03:31.920> of<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.130> mine<00:03:32.310> comes<00:03:32.610> if<00:03:33.090> I

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
like jump out of the mine comes if I

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.600 
like jump out of the mine comes if I
come<00:03:33.450> back<00:03:33.630> so<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:34.739> be<00:03:34.860> safe<00:03:35.100> you<00:03:35.130> have<00:03:35.459> to

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
come back so to be safe you have to

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.560 
come back so to be safe you have to
store<00:03:35.880> them<00:03:36.030> in<00:03:36.239> here<00:03:36.770> and<00:03:37.770> then<00:03:38.370> you<00:03:39.120> can<00:03:39.330> be<00:03:39.540> a

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
store them in here and then you can be a

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.610 
store them in here and then you can be a
happy<00:03:39.900> farmer<00:03:40.410> no<00:03:40.890> I<00:03:41.250> did<00:03:41.459> it<00:03:41.550> again<00:03:42.470> then<00:03:43.470> you

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
happy farmer no I did it again then you

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.610 
happy farmer no I did it again then you
can<00:03:43.800> be<00:03:43.950> a<00:03:43.980> happy<00:03:44.220> farmer<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:45.510> breed<00:03:46.380> animals

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
can be a happy farmer and breed animals

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.280 
can be a happy farmer and breed animals
as<00:03:47.130> crazy<00:03:47.520> mess<00:03:48.030> breed<00:03:48.420> you<00:03:48.630> know<00:03:48.750> we've<00:03:49.020> got<00:03:49.260> a

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
as crazy mess breed you know we've got a

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.720 
as crazy mess breed you know we've got a
cycle<00:03:49.739> carousing<00:03:50.250> so<00:03:50.940> like<00:03:51.420> it<00:03:51.630> or<00:03:51.750> not<00:03:52.730> mass

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
cycle carousing so like it or not mass

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.520 
cycle carousing so like it or not mass
breeding<00:03:54.209> will<00:03:54.390> be<00:03:54.510> a<00:03:54.540> part<00:03:54.840> of<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:55.080> game<00:03:55.260> and

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
breeding will be a part of the game and

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.250 
breeding will be a part of the game and
I<00:03:55.590> will<00:03:55.650> try<00:03:55.950> to<00:03:55.980> implement<00:03:56.400> that<00:03:56.730> design<00:03:57.270> in

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
I will try to implement that design in

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.729 
I will try to implement that design in
the<00:03:58.500> world<00:03:58.890> tour<00:03:59.190> maybe<00:03:59.970> a<00:04:00.180> bit<00:04:00.510> different<00:04:00.739> but

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
the world tour maybe a bit different but

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.310 
the world tour maybe a bit different but
yeah<00:04:02.130> this<00:04:02.610> is<00:04:02.670> probably<00:04:03.239> how<00:04:03.540> it's<00:04:03.690> gonna<00:04:03.959> be

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
yeah this is probably how it's gonna be

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.560 
yeah this is probably how it's gonna be
let<00:04:05.280> me<00:04:05.430> know<00:04:05.550> what<00:04:05.760> you<00:04:05.880> think<00:04:06.120> about<00:04:06.239> the

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
let me know what you think about the

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.390 
let me know what you think about the
design<00:04:06.720> make<00:04:07.440> sure<00:04:07.620> to<00:04:07.770> check<00:04:07.980> out<00:04:08.190> the<00:04:08.370> other

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
design make sure to check out the other

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.550 
design make sure to check out the other
breeding<00:04:09.030> videos<00:04:09.390> I<00:04:09.570> was<00:04:09.720> referring<00:04:10.110> to<00:04:10.260> in

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
breeding videos I was referring to in

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.440 
breeding videos I was referring to in
the<00:04:10.680> video<00:04:10.830> description<00:04:11.070> so<00:04:11.700> you<00:04:11.760> know<00:04:12.000> what

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
the video description so you know what

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.150 
the video description so you know what
we're<00:04:12.630> talking<00:04:12.840> about<00:04:13.290> and<00:04:13.530> we<00:04:13.680> can<00:04:13.890> avoid

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
we're talking about and we can avoid

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.310 
we're talking about and we can avoid
yeah<00:04:14.959> unnecessary

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
yeah unnecessary

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.580 
yeah unnecessary
nations<00:04:16.770> and<00:04:17.040> questions<00:04:17.520> but<00:04:18.330> I<00:04:18.660> think<00:04:18.720> you

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
nations and questions but I think you

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.340 
nations and questions but I think you
get<00:04:19.800> the<00:04:19.980> idea<00:04:20.330> let<00:04:21.330> me<00:04:21.480> know<00:04:21.630> if<00:04:21.780> you<00:04:21.930> like<00:04:22.110> it

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
get the idea let me know if you like it

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.620 
get the idea let me know if you like it
that's<00:04:23.040> it<00:04:23.400> for<00:04:23.700> today<00:04:24.290> I'm<00:04:25.290> out
