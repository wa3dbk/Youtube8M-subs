 stove heats it and gives some olive oil 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.370
 in 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.930

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.850
 nice crispy seared and cfk the rooms 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:01:04.470
 namely on the baking tray and afterwards 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:06.799
 Come buy some tomato sauce and where 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.799
 one is 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.299
 I have it before me frankly I 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.890
 must confess that two bit 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.740
 looks 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:25.159
 maybe this time it tastes very good 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:28.360
 tastes even fans taste this 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.360
 try mass 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.850
 Yes 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.680
 that was already so far then come 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.590
 the great she has just offered 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.450
 on top of that nicely issued 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:49.119
 then I will be in fan and falling 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:51.280
 also the bitter on and around the whole 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:57.940
 To top it off, the pizza cheese comes again 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:59.950
 on top of it so it really looks nice 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.030
 strong on the sea code so no 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.430
 real chance with the tomato sauce 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.259
 have to taste because it never again 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.149
 our epi suddenly on the tour 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.160
 that's what my favorite beer is for 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:12.280
 I think it suits you well you can now 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.769
 in the oven for about 20 minutes at 180 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.120
 degrees above bottom for a correct one 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:20.470
 Doner pizza may be missing, of course 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.630
 no case that comes now 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.540
 done on it 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.910
 We have a lot of gow3 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.519
 of course because it is a yoghurt sauce 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.220
 besides, we have such good garlic 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.690
 pepper garlic very importantly so 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:45.100
 infinite life just fresh 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:48.670
 garlic or very important because of 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.900
 boy actually so much taste and 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.900

00:02:52.799 --> 00:03:01.420
 I have no idea ok olive oil village 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.269
 quite often a good show so then 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:07.930
 it should now be daytime 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:14.910
 but also and it smells like that already 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:14.910
 fantastic that about cold war cool 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:28.820
 we also get ready 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:32.320

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.320

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:46.690
 thin straighten thin pretty well and it 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.380
 As you know, it makes you more beautiful 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.890
 I think he can even do one more 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.810
 bit more on it he must properly 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.960
 makes 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:59.180
 Do not trust me so completely so my sons 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:02.150
 you always do that pretty much because 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.440
 which also properly garlic the farmers 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.490
 drive garlic 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.490
 you have guaranteed that 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:21.380
 you also have the appetite 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:37.520
 I'm always faster is the 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:38.930
 certain places are really too slow 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.730
 That's a good sign 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.170
 instead of in any case by part over 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.820

 yes, well, that 's not very hot 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.420

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.240

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:00.260
