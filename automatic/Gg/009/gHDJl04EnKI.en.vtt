00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
the switch is going to be from here

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.319 
the switch is going to be from here
going<00:00:46.050> from<00:00:46.260> this<00:00:47.989> to<00:00:48.989> this

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
going from this to this

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:57.830

then you're gonna switch then you're
gonna<00:01:10.750> start<00:01:11.110> plucking<00:01:11.380> from<00:01:11.770> the<00:01:11.920> third

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
gonna start plucking from the third

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.179 
gonna start plucking from the third
string<00:01:13.439> then<00:01:14.439> you're<00:01:14.560> gonna<00:01:14.649> do<00:01:14.860> this<00:01:15.040> then

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
string then you're gonna do this then

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:26.639 
string then you're gonna do this then
the<00:01:18.189> second<00:01:18.549> string<00:01:20.759> got<00:01:21.759> that<00:01:25.500> that's<00:01:26.500> the

the second string got that that's the
beginning<00:01:27.039> of<00:01:27.130> the<00:01:27.220> second<00:01:27.549> part<00:01:33.570> now

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
beginning of the second part now

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:41.070 
beginning of the second part now
practice<00:01:35.439> that<00:01:39.390> cuz<00:01:40.390> it's<00:01:40.569> only<00:01:40.720> gonna<00:01:40.899> get

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
practice that cuz it's only gonna get

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:50.120 
practice that cuz it's only gonna get
harder<00:01:41.319> from<00:01:41.590> that<00:01:42.450> so

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.910 

switch<00:01:51.710> the<00:01:52.710> third<00:01:52.979> string

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.320 

I<00:01:58.009> practice<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.460> I'll<00:01:59.700> teach<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.119> next

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
I practice that and I'll teach the next

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.180 
I practice that and I'll teach the next
part<00:02:00.570> on<00:02:01.470> the<00:02:01.619> next<00:02:01.830> video<00:02:02.070> good<00:02:03.000> luck
