I<00:00:05.569> recently<00:00:06.569> wanted<00:00:07.170> to<00:00:07.379> learn<00:00:07.500> how<00:00:07.560> to<00:00:08.210> wrap<00:00:09.210> a

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
I recently wanted to learn how to wrap a

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.009 
I recently wanted to learn how to wrap a
sandwich<00:00:09.540> for<00:00:09.990> picnics<00:00:10.580> or<00:00:11.580> lunches<00:00:12.030> with<00:00:12.540> wax

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
sandwich for picnics or lunches with wax

sandwich for picnics or lunches with wax
paper<00:00:13.170> I<00:00:13.650> looked<00:00:14.280> on<00:00:14.429> YouTube<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.480> I<00:00:15.509> couldn't

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
paper I looked on YouTube and I couldn't

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.240 
paper I looked on YouTube and I couldn't
find<00:00:16.049> any<00:00:16.949> how<00:00:17.190> to's<00:00:17.460> up<00:00:17.910> there<00:00:18.980> anywhere<00:00:19.980> I

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
find any how to's up there anywhere I

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.220 
find any how to's up there anywhere I
think<00:00:20.880> I<00:00:20.970> found<00:00:21.119> one<00:00:21.420> or<00:00:21.539> two<00:00:21.660> it<00:00:21.840> wasn't<00:00:22.170> very

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
think I found one or two it wasn't very

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.590 
think I found one or two it wasn't very
efficient<00:00:22.710> so<00:00:23.369> I<00:00:23.400> figured<00:00:23.730> I'd<00:00:23.850> show<00:00:24.390> how<00:00:24.570> I

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
efficient so I figured I'd show how I

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.589 
efficient so I figured I'd show how I
did<00:00:24.840> this<00:00:24.960> one<00:00:25.199> this<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.400> regular<00:00:27.300> sandwich

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
did this one this is a regular sandwich

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.980 
did this one this is a regular sandwich
with<00:00:27.990> regular<00:00:28.320> regular<00:00:28.920> loaf<00:00:29.130> bread<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.990> this

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
with regular regular loaf bread and this

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.290 
with regular regular loaf bread and this
is<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:32.719> it's<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.780> turkey<00:00:34.170> club<00:00:34.820> you<00:00:35.820> can<00:00:35.969> see<00:00:36.149> how

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
is a it's a turkey club you can see how

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.110 
is a it's a turkey club you can see how
nice<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.750> tightly<00:00:36.930> wrap<00:00:37.260> this<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.850> very<00:00:38.850> nice

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
nice and tightly wrap this is very nice

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:46.060 
nice and tightly wrap this is very nice
show<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.079> how<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:40.230> did<00:00:40.379> that

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.830 

if<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.190> take<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:47.610> in<00:00:47.820> which<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.570> get<00:00:48.809> a

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
if you take this in which you get a

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.619 
if you take this in which you get a
sheet<00:00:49.110> about<00:00:50.090> about<00:00:52.309> twice<00:00:53.309> as<00:00:53.520> long<00:00:54.120> as<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.480> is

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
sheet about about twice as long as it is

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.020 
sheet about about twice as long as it is
wide<00:00:54.920> pretty<00:00:55.920> much<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.460> set<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.760> right<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:56.910> the

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
wide pretty much you set it right in the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:04.000 
wide pretty much you set it right in the
center<00:01:00.649> you<00:01:01.649> pick<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.190> two<00:01:02.370> long<00:01:02.609> hands<00:01:02.940> up

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
center you pick the two long hands up

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.180 
center you pick the two long hands up
and

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:14.600 

put<00:01:08.190> them<00:01:08.340> together<00:01:13.130> earlier<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.220> was<00:01:14.370> cutting

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
put them together earlier I was cutting

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.719 
put them together earlier I was cutting
pieces<00:01:15.000> off<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.479> edge<00:01:15.630> but<00:01:16.340> it's<00:01:17.340> better<00:01:17.580> not

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
pieces off the edge but it's better not

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.820 
pieces off the edge but it's better not
to<00:01:17.790> do<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.120> because<00:01:18.300> it<00:01:18.810> makes<00:01:19.050> it<00:01:19.200> traps<00:01:19.680> a

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
to do that because it makes it traps a

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.580 
to do that because it makes it traps a
tighter<00:01:20.070> get<00:01:20.729> more<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.060> work<00:01:21.180> with

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
tighter get more to work with

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.080 
tighter get more to work with
and<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.680> wrap<00:01:23.070> those<00:01:23.250> two<00:01:23.460> edges<00:01:23.580> down<00:01:26.090> you

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
and you wrap those two edges down you

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.150 
and you wrap those two edges down you
just<00:01:27.330> take<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.750> fold<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.170> probably<00:01:28.860> about<00:01:28.950> an

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.160 
just take and fold it probably about an

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.670 
just take and fold it probably about an
inch<00:01:29.630> and<00:01:30.630> doing<00:01:30.840> like<00:01:30.960> an<00:01:31.080> inch<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.350> sand

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
inch and doing like an inch and sand

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.310 
inch and doing like an inch and sand
it's<00:01:31.950> going<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.190> I'd<00:01:32.940> start<00:01:33.270> wide<00:01:33.479> because<00:01:34.080> if

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
it's going to I'd start wide because if

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.469 
it's going to I'd start wide because if
as<00:01:34.830> you<00:01:35.250> roll<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.550> down<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.940> will<00:01:36.030> get<00:01:36.150> smaller

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
as you roll it down it will get smaller

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.420 
as you roll it down it will get smaller
and<00:01:36.600> smaller<00:01:36.770> because<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.860> have<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.130> tighten

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
and smaller because you have to tighten

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.980 
and smaller because you have to tighten
it<00:01:38.580> up<00:01:39.050> try<00:01:40.050> to<00:01:40.080> get<00:01:40.290> all<00:01:40.440> the<00:01:40.500> way<00:01:40.560> across<00:01:40.800> so

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
it up try to get all the way across so

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.420 
it up try to get all the way across so
you<00:01:42.990> want<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.320> pull<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:43.770> pull<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.280> with

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
you want to pull it and pull it with

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.499 
you want to pull it and pull it with
your<00:01:44.550> fingers<00:01:44.820> here<00:01:44.940> tighten<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.479> little

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
your fingers here tighten it a little

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.410 
your fingers here tighten it a little
bit<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.899> makes<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.560> smaller

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
bit it makes it smaller

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.450 
bit it makes it smaller
just<00:01:48.420> keep<00:01:48.660> the<00:01:48.810> wrapping<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.200> around<00:01:49.460> until

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
just keep the wrapping it around until

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:58.190 
just keep the wrapping it around until
it<00:01:50.640> touches<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.210> bread<00:01:51.600> here<00:01:54.619> then<00:01:57.050> push<00:01:58.050> it

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
it touches the bread here then push it

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.320 
it touches the bread here then push it
down<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.649> tightens<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:59.190> up<00:01:59.310> from<00:02:00.180> these

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
down and it tightens it up from these

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.499 
down and it tightens it up from these
two<00:02:00.539> ends<00:02:00.840> here<00:02:02.000> try<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.060> make<00:02:03.210> sure<00:02:03.360> it's

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
two ends here try to make sure it's

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.779 
two ends here try to make sure it's
centered<00:02:04.369> and<00:02:05.369> this<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.090> fun<00:02:06.960> part

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
centered and this is the fun part

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.390 
centered and this is the fun part
basically<00:02:08.789> you<00:02:09.119> just<00:02:09.739> go<00:02:10.739> around<00:02:10.830> here<00:02:11.160> you

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
basically you just go around here you

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.770 
basically you just go around here you
don't<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:11.670> won't<00:02:11.790> tighten<00:02:12.060> this<00:02:12.330> all<00:02:12.570> the<00:02:12.690> way

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
don't you won't tighten this all the way

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.060 
don't you won't tighten this all the way
around<00:02:12.900> this<00:02:13.110> side<00:02:13.320> of<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.500> sandwich<00:02:13.799> so<00:02:14.010> you

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
around this side of the sandwich so you

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.300 
around this side of the sandwich so you
tighten<00:02:14.459> it<00:02:14.519> down<00:02:15.410> press<00:02:16.410> here<00:02:16.709> not<00:02:16.920> of<00:02:17.190> course

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
tighten it down press here not of course

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.620 
tighten it down press here not of course
not<00:02:17.519> too<00:02:17.640> much<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:18.680> damage<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.830> sandwich<00:02:20.630> and

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
not too much to damage the sandwich and

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.720 
not too much to damage the sandwich and
you<00:02:21.780> just<00:02:22.019> hold<00:02:22.260> it<00:02:22.410> like<00:02:22.440> that<00:02:22.799> pick<00:02:23.310> one<00:02:23.519> side

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
you just hold it like that pick one side

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.210 
you just hold it like that pick one side
up<00:02:26.090> and<00:02:27.090> tuck<00:02:27.450> it<00:02:27.600> in<00:02:27.750> hold<00:02:28.470> this<00:02:28.650> piece<00:02:28.860> here

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
up and tuck it in hold this piece here

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.490 
up and tuck it in hold this piece here
and<00:02:30.180> it's<00:02:30.480> going<00:02:30.600> to<00:02:30.660> curve<00:02:30.900> around<00:02:31.080> that's

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
and it's going to curve around that's

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.140 
and it's going to curve around that's
fine<00:02:31.709> so<00:02:31.920> let<00:02:32.070> it<00:02:32.160> curve<00:02:32.340> around<00:02:32.489> you're<00:02:33.060> going
