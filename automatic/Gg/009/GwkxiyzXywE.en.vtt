approach painting a silver Birchtree I
first<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.840> all<00:00:33.899> drew<00:00:34.170> in<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.410> basic<00:00:34.800> shape<00:00:35.010> of

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
first of all drew in the basic shape of

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.100 
first of all drew in the basic shape of
the<00:00:35.219> tree<00:00:35.489> trunk<00:00:35.850> mask<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.600> out<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:36.989> then

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
the tree trunk mask it out and then

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.780 
the tree trunk mask it out and then
painted<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.559> dark<00:00:37.800> green<00:00:38.040> background

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
painted a dark green background

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.610

I've<00:00:38.850> now<00:00:39.120> removed<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.629> masking<00:00:39.989> fluid<00:00:40.050> and

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
I've now removed the masking fluid and

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.560 
I've now removed the masking fluid and
I've<00:00:40.860> made<00:00:41.040> three<00:00:41.309> washes<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.850> paint<00:00:42.149> I'm

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
I've made three washes of paint I'm

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.229 
I've made three washes of paint I'm
going<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.019> start<00:00:43.379> by<00:00:43.680> wetting<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.850> whole<00:00:45.059> of

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
going to start by wetting the whole of

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.660 
going to start by wetting the whole of
the<00:00:45.390> tree<00:00:45.600> trunk<00:00:45.989> with<00:00:46.230> clean<00:00:46.769> water<00:00:47.040> this

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
the tree trunk with clean water this

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.160 
the tree trunk with clean water this
enables<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.269> colors<00:00:48.570> I'm<00:00:48.690> going<00:00:48.720> to<00:00:48.930> flow<00:00:49.110> it

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
enables the colors I'm going to flow it

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.719 
enables the colors I'm going to flow it
into<00:00:49.409> the<00:00:49.530> soft<00:00:49.829> background<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.460> blend

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:50.729 
into the soft background to blend

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:53.030 
into the soft background to blend
together<00:00:50.970> so<00:00:51.420> first<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.320> all<00:00:52.470> I'm<00:00:52.739> going<00:00:52.949> to

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
together so first of all I'm going to

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.420 
together so first of all I'm going to
put<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.220> little<00:00:53.460> bit<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.970> the<00:00:54.839> cobalt<00:00:55.260> blue<00:00:55.430> and

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
put a little bit of the cobalt blue and

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.899 
put a little bit of the cobalt blue and
cobalt<00:00:57.089> violet<00:00:57.300> mixture<00:00:57.960> in<00:00:58.110> I'm

00:00:58.899 --> 00:00:58.909 
cobalt violet mixture in I'm

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:02.020 
cobalt violet mixture in I'm
concentrating<00:00:59.909> more<00:01:00.690> color<00:01:00.989> towards<00:01:01.320> the

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
concentrating more color towards the

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.950 
concentrating more color towards the
right-hand<00:01:03.030> side<00:01:03.269> of<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.480> trunk<00:01:03.719> because

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
right-hand side of the trunk because

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.960 
right-hand side of the trunk because
I've<00:01:04.199> got<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.530> light<00:01:04.739> coming<00:01:05.429> from<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.729> left

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
I've got the light coming from the left

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.999 
I've got the light coming from the left
so<00:01:06.330> I'm<00:01:06.390> putting<00:01:06.690> a<00:01:06.750> bit<00:01:06.960> more<00:01:07.200> color<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:07.979> a

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:08.009 
so I'm putting a bit more color and a

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.300 
so I'm putting a bit more color and a
bit<00:01:08.160> more<00:01:08.190> shadow<00:01:08.820> onto<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.830> right<00:01:10.830> hand<00:01:10.860> side

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
bit more shadow onto the right hand side

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.680 
bit more shadow onto the right hand side
I<00:01:11.580> don't<00:01:11.820> need<00:01:11.940> to<00:01:12.000> worry<00:01:12.149> about<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.539> little

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
I don't need to worry about that little

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.370 
I don't need to worry about that little
branch<00:01:13.020> there<00:01:13.320> for<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.560> time<00:01:13.770> being<00:01:15.380> then

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
branch there for the time being then

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.859 
branch there for the time being then
cleaning<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.580> brush<00:01:17.789> I'm<00:01:18.060> picking<00:01:18.450> up<00:01:18.600> the

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
cleaning the brush I'm picking up the

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.200 
cleaning the brush I'm picking up the
orange<00:01:19.590> color<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.250> mixture<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.759> raw

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
orange color this is a mixture of raw

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.480 
orange color this is a mixture of raw
sienna<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.960> burnt<00:01:22.050> sienna<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.950> this<00:01:23.190> puts<00:01:23.399> a

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
sienna and burnt sienna and this puts a

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.919 
sienna and burnt sienna and this puts a
little<00:01:23.700> bit<00:01:23.789> of<00:01:23.909> warmth<00:01:24.300> into<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.780> little

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:24.929 
little bit of warmth into it a little

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:26.960 
little bit of warmth into it a little
bit<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.200> sunlight<00:01:25.470> making<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.550> little<00:01:26.670> bit

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
bit of sunlight making it a little bit

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.859 
bit of sunlight making it a little bit
blotchy<00:01:27.780> any<00:01:28.319> regular<00:01:29.330> not<00:01:30.330> too<00:01:30.569> neat<00:01:30.840> and

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
blotchy any regular not too neat and

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.560 
blotchy any regular not too neat and
tidy<00:01:31.640> at<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.759> same<00:01:32.970> time<00:01:33.210> though<00:01:33.390> I'm<00:01:33.450> trying

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
tidy at the same time though I'm trying

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.080 
tidy at the same time though I'm trying
to<00:01:33.810> get<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.340> cylindrical<00:01:35.340> effect<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:35.939> I

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
to get that cylindrical effect and I

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.830 
to get that cylindrical effect and I
make<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.360> trunk<00:01:36.630> look<00:01:36.899> rounded<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:38.720> little<00:01:39.720> bit

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
make the trunk look rounded a little bit

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.069 
make the trunk look rounded a little bit
more<00:01:40.020> blue<00:01:40.229> down<00:01:40.500> here<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:40.829> think<00:01:41.600> maybe<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.720> bit

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
more blue down here I think maybe a bit

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.319 
more blue down here I think maybe a bit
more<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.310> orange<00:01:44.640> I'm<00:01:44.790> going<00:01:44.969> to<00:01:45.090> make

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
more of the orange I'm going to make

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.510 
more of the orange I'm going to make
that<00:01:45.509> raw<00:01:46.020> sienna<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.439> burnt<00:01:46.530> sienna<00:01:46.799> mixture

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
that raw sienna and burnt sienna mixture

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.060 
that raw sienna and burnt sienna mixture
slightly<00:01:48.270> redder<00:01:48.600> by<00:01:49.560> adding<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.860> bit<00:01:50.009> more

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
slightly redder by adding a bit more

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.260 
slightly redder by adding a bit more
burnt<00:01:50.549> sienna<00:01:52.909> to<00:01:53.909> shove<00:01:54.240> that<00:01:54.270> into<00:01:54.600> there<00:01:54.960> a

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
burnt sienna to shove that into there a

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.120 
burnt sienna to shove that into there a
case<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.509> working<00:01:57.810> fairly<00:01:58.469> rapidly<00:01:58.950> while

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
case of working fairly rapidly while

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.100 
case of working fairly rapidly while
your<00:01:59.369> background<00:01:59.850> remains<00:02:00.210> wet<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:00.990> the

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
your background remains wet so that the

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.800 
your background remains wet so that the
colors<00:02:01.439> do<00:02:01.829> mix<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.670> blend<00:02:02.939> but<00:02:03.479> I'm<00:02:03.600> keeping

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
colors do mix and blend but I'm keeping

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.569 
colors do mix and blend but I'm keeping
away<00:02:04.259> from<00:02:04.289> that<00:02:04.740> left-hand<00:02:05.219> side<00:02:05.399> of<00:02:05.490> the

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
away from that left-hand side of the

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.429 
away from that left-hand side of the
trunk<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:06.090> I've<00:02:06.149> got<00:02:06.329> some<00:02:06.509> white<00:02:06.719> paper<00:02:07.110> there

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
trunk so I've got some white paper there

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.660 
trunk so I've got some white paper there
to<00:02:07.920> look<00:02:08.070> like<00:02:08.340> light<00:02:09.299> and<00:02:10.130> now<00:02:11.130> picking<00:02:11.459> up

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
to look like light and now picking up

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.300 
to look like light and now picking up
the<00:02:11.730> brown<00:02:12.720> mixture<00:02:13.410> this<00:02:13.799> is<00:02:13.859> the<00:02:14.100> burnt

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
the brown mixture this is the burnt

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.310 
the brown mixture this is the burnt
sienna<00:02:14.519> and<00:02:14.760> cobalt<00:02:15.269> blue<00:02:15.510> this<00:02:15.959> should<00:02:16.170> be

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
sienna and cobalt blue this should be

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.500 
sienna and cobalt blue this should be
slightly<00:02:16.620> thicker<00:02:17.220> than<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.880> previous<00:02:18.299> two

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
slightly thicker than the previous two

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.319 
slightly thicker than the previous two
colors<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:19.530> let's<00:02:19.980> concentrate<00:02:20.370> this<00:02:21.000> more

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:21.329 
colors and let's concentrate this more

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:24.890 
colors and let's concentrate this more
or<00:02:21.480> less<00:02:21.660> at<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:23.209> right-hand<00:02:24.209> side<00:02:24.510> of<00:02:24.690> the

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
or less at the right-hand side of the

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:33.410 
or less at the right-hand side of the
trunk<00:02:25.140> bringing<00:02:25.680> it<00:02:25.799> into<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.190> branch<00:02:26.430> there

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.820 

best<00:02:34.420> not<00:02:34.600> to<00:02:34.720> overdo<00:02:35.020> it<00:02:35.140> I'm<00:02:35.320> using<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.650> very

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
best not to overdo it I'm using the very

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.290 
best not to overdo it I'm using the very
point<00:02:36.130> of<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.370> brush<00:02:36.580> so<00:02:36.790> I<00:02:36.820> don't<00:02:37.000> put<00:02:37.120> too

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
point of the brush so I don't put too

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.170 
point of the brush so I don't put too
much<00:02:37.420> paint<00:02:37.660> in<00:02:38.310> if<00:02:39.310> you<00:02:39.460> overdo<00:02:39.790> it<00:02:39.820> and<00:02:40.000> lose

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
much paint in if you overdo it and lose

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.600 
much paint in if you overdo it and lose
that<00:02:40.390> light<00:02:40.950> it's<00:02:41.950> very<00:02:42.010> difficult<00:02:42.460> to<00:02:42.520> get

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
that light it's very difficult to get

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.870 
that light it's very difficult to get
that<00:02:42.820> back<00:02:43.030> again

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
that back again

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.540 
that back again
okay<00:02:45.880> I'm<00:02:45.940> cleaning<00:02:46.330> the<00:02:46.420> brush<00:02:46.600> again

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
okay I'm cleaning the brush again

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.250 
okay I'm cleaning the brush again
topping<00:02:48.550> it<00:02:48.640> up<00:02:48.730> with<00:02:48.880> clean<00:02:49.120> water<00:02:49.330> and<00:02:49.840> I'm

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
topping it up with clean water and I'm

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.440 
topping it up with clean water and I'm
just<00:02:50.410> going<00:02:50.620> to<00:02:50.770> coat<00:02:51.010> this<00:02:51.310> branch<00:02:51.670> with

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
just going to coat this branch with

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.690 
just going to coat this branch with
clean<00:02:52.750> water<00:02:52.990> allowing<00:02:53.740> that<00:02:53.920> dark<00:02:54.220> brown<00:02:54.459> to

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
clean water allowing that dark brown to

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.730 
clean water allowing that dark brown to
wander<00:02:55.150> into<00:02:55.300> it<00:02:55.570> to<00:02:55.690> touch<00:02:55.870> then<00:02:56.470> I'm<00:02:56.590> getting

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
wander into it to touch then I'm getting

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.360 
wander into it to touch then I'm getting
a<00:02:56.980> smaller<00:02:57.340> brush<00:02:57.700> and<00:02:59.010> some<00:03:00.010> more<00:03:00.160> of<00:03:00.220> that

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
a smaller brush and some more of that

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.910 
a smaller brush and some more of that
brown<00:03:00.900> and<00:03:01.900> I'm<00:03:01.990> putting<00:03:02.200> that<00:03:02.350> along<00:03:02.740> the

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
brown and I'm putting that along the

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:10.380 
brown and I'm putting that along the
underside<00:03:03.640> of<00:03:04.950> that<00:03:05.950> branch<00:03:09.000> but<00:03:10.000> a<00:03:10.060> smaller

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
underside of that branch but a smaller

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.850 
underside of that branch but a smaller
branch<00:03:10.750> coming<00:03:11.050> off<00:03:11.230> it<00:03:13.560> I'm<00:03:14.560> going<00:03:14.830> to

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
branch coming off it I'm going to

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.580 
branch coming off it I'm going to
encourage<00:03:15.160> that<00:03:15.360> to<00:03:16.360> blend<00:03:16.660> by<00:03:17.080> just<00:03:17.320> going

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
encourage that to blend by just going

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.479 
encourage that to blend by just going
over<00:03:17.770> it<00:03:18.010> with<00:03:18.040> a<00:03:18.160> damp<00:03:18.459> clean<00:03:18.760> brush<00:03:20.340> now<00:03:21.340> that

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
over it with a damp clean brush now that

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:26.070 
over it with a damp clean brush now that
needs<00:03:21.730> some<00:03:21.910> drying<00:03:22.180> time<00:03:24.570> so<00:03:25.570> we<00:03:25.690> can<00:03:25.840> see<00:03:26.050> now

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
needs some drying time so we can see now

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.020 
needs some drying time so we can see now
that<00:03:26.290> that's<00:03:26.620> dry<00:03:27.010> that<00:03:27.340> the<00:03:27.489> trunk<00:03:27.790> has<00:03:28.000> a

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
that that's dry that the trunk has a

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.180 
that that's dry that the trunk has a
sort<00:03:28.300> of<00:03:28.390> cylindrical<00:03:28.840> effect<00:03:29.470> to<00:03:29.680> it<00:03:29.830> and<00:03:30.070> I

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
sort of cylindrical effect to it and I

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.920 
sort of cylindrical effect to it and I
achieved<00:03:30.310> this<00:03:30.820> by<00:03:30.880> putting<00:03:31.330> more<00:03:31.660> of<00:03:31.840> the

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
achieved this by putting more of the

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.660 
achieved this by putting more of the
color<00:03:32.140> over<00:03:32.440> at<00:03:32.530> the<00:03:32.650> right<00:03:32.830> hand<00:03:33.100> side<00:03:33.370> and

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
color over at the right hand side and

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.910 
color over at the right hand side and
leaving<00:03:34.180> more<00:03:34.390> white<00:03:34.630> paper<00:03:35.019> at<00:03:35.260> the<00:03:35.350> left<00:03:35.590> it

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
leaving more white paper at the left it

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.800 
leaving more white paper at the left it
was<00:03:36.100> very<00:03:36.310> important<00:03:36.940> that<00:03:37.209> I<00:03:37.450> did<00:03:37.660> this

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
was very important that I did this

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.780 
was very important that I did this
fairly<00:03:38.049> quickly<00:03:38.320> so<00:03:39.040> that<00:03:39.190> I<00:03:39.220> could<00:03:39.400> take<00:03:39.580> out

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
fairly quickly so that I could take out

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.430 
fairly quickly so that I could take out
a<00:03:39.820> vantage<00:03:40.030> of<00:03:40.239> the<00:03:40.450> wetness<00:03:40.690> of<00:03:41.019> the<00:03:41.140> trunk

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
a vantage of the wetness of the trunk

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.520 
a vantage of the wetness of the trunk
and<00:03:41.860> let<00:03:42.040> the<00:03:42.160> colors<00:03:42.430> blend<00:03:42.670> into<00:03:42.970> each<00:03:43.150> other

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
and let the colors blend into each other

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.530 
and let the colors blend into each other
so<00:03:44.530> there's<00:03:45.100> only<00:03:45.190> a<00:03:45.489> little<00:03:45.730> bit<00:03:45.850> of<00:03:46.090> detail

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
so there's only a little bit of detail

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.960 
so there's only a little bit of detail
to<00:03:46.720> put<00:03:46.900> in<00:03:47.080> now<00:03:47.320> so<00:03:47.890> I've<00:03:47.980> made<00:03:48.160> a<00:03:48.220> fairly<00:03:48.610> dark

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
to put in now so I've made a fairly dark

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.750 
to put in now so I've made a fairly dark
brown<00:03:49.450> mixture<00:03:50.170> now<00:03:50.350> with<00:03:50.650> burnt<00:03:51.070> sienna<00:03:51.489> and

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
brown mixture now with burnt sienna and

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.060 
brown mixture now with burnt sienna and
ultramarine<00:03:52.720> blue<00:03:52.750> this<00:03:53.380> is<00:03:53.440> just<00:03:53.769> a<00:03:53.860> little

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
ultramarine blue this is just a little

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.470 
ultramarine blue this is just a little
bit<00:03:54.190> darker<00:03:54.400> than<00:03:54.640> the<00:03:54.850> brown<00:03:55.060> uh<00:03:55.090> put<00:03:55.330> in

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
bit darker than the brown uh put in

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.330 
bit darker than the brown uh put in
earlier<00:03:55.630> and<00:03:55.959> I've<00:03:56.230> got<00:03:56.410> a<00:03:56.440> number<00:03:56.830> two<00:03:57.100> or

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
earlier and I've got a number two or

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.000 
earlier and I've got a number two or
detailer<00:03:58.120> brush<00:03:58.269> and<00:03:58.720> often<00:03:59.470> with<00:03:59.590> a<00:03:59.620> silver

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
detailer brush and often with a silver

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.370 
detailer brush and often with a silver
birch<00:04:00.220> you<00:04:00.250> get<00:04:00.610> a<00:04:00.640> few<00:04:01.000> rings<00:04:01.780> around<00:04:02.200> the

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
birch you get a few rings around the

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.650 
birch you get a few rings around the
trunk<00:04:02.680> and<00:04:03.070> put<00:04:03.220> in<00:04:03.370> a<00:04:03.459> few<00:04:03.640> suggestions<00:04:04.420> of

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
trunk and put in a few suggestions of

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:12.690 
trunk and put in a few suggestions of
these<00:04:04.870> in<00:04:08.940> they<00:04:09.940> are<00:04:10.060> slightly<00:04:11.280> curved<00:04:12.280> to

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
these in they are slightly curved to

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.720 
these in they are slightly curved to
sort<00:04:12.910> of<00:04:12.970> emphasize<00:04:13.510> the<00:04:14.280> cylindrical<00:04:15.280> nature

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
sort of emphasize the cylindrical nature

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.870 
sort of emphasize the cylindrical nature
of<00:04:15.820> the<00:04:15.940> trunk<00:04:16.209> again<00:04:17.340> best<00:04:18.340> to<00:04:18.430> keep<00:04:18.609> stopping

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
of the trunk again best to keep stopping

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.190 
of the trunk again best to keep stopping
having<00:04:19.269> a<00:04:19.329> look<00:04:19.450> what<00:04:19.630> you're<00:04:19.780> doing<00:04:19.959> as<00:04:20.049> well

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
having a look what you're doing as well

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.539 
having a look what you're doing as well
because<00:04:20.410> anything<00:04:20.739> like<00:04:20.919> this<00:04:21.100> it's<00:04:21.310> very

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
because anything like this it's very

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.050 
because anything like this it's very
easy<00:04:21.820> to<00:04:22.210> overdo<00:04:23.050> it<00:04:23.460> if<00:04:24.460> you<00:04:24.640> get<00:04:24.820> a<00:04:24.850> few

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
easy to overdo it if you get a few

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.840 
easy to overdo it if you get a few
little<00:04:25.240> marks<00:04:25.930> in<00:04:26.229> the<00:04:26.650> trunk<00:04:26.950> some<00:04:27.580> little

little marks in the trunk some little
irregular<00:04:28.240> shapes<00:04:32.550> letting<00:04:33.550> a<00:04:33.610> little<00:04:33.790> bit<00:04:34.090> of

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
irregular shapes letting a little bit of

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.300 
irregular shapes letting a little bit of
the<00:04:34.390> dark<00:04:34.630> color<00:04:34.870> going<00:04:35.050> to<00:04:35.200> the<00:04:35.500> left-hand

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
the dark color going to the left-hand

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.640 
the dark color going to the left-hand
side<00:04:36.520> but<00:04:36.669> I<00:04:36.729> still<00:04:37.000> am<00:04:37.120> concentrating<00:04:37.650> more

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
side but I still am concentrating more

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.070 
side but I still am concentrating more
dark<00:04:38.979> over<00:04:39.460> at<00:04:39.610> the<00:04:39.789> right<00:04:40.419> hand<00:04:40.690> side<00:04:40.900> of<00:04:41.020> the

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
dark over at the right hand side of the

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.080 
dark over at the right hand side of the
trunk<00:04:41.410> I've<00:04:41.800> added<00:04:41.979> a<00:04:42.099> bit<00:04:42.220> more<00:04:42.280> burnt<00:04:42.700> sienna

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
trunk I've added a bit more burnt sienna

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.020 
trunk I've added a bit more burnt sienna
now<00:04:43.210> to<00:04:43.270> make<00:04:43.539> this<00:04:43.660> a<00:04:43.720> little<00:04:43.930> redder

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
now to make this a little redder

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.770 
now to make this a little redder
we'll<00:04:46.030> just<00:04:46.240> do<00:04:46.450> a<00:04:46.480> little<00:04:46.600> bit<00:04:46.990> more<00:04:48.660> bit<00:04:49.660> of

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
we'll just do a little bit more bit of

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.110 
we'll just do a little bit more bit of
texture<00:04:50.230> on<00:04:50.380> that<00:04:50.410> brunch<00:04:50.860> but<00:04:51.400> again<00:04:51.820> it's

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
texture on that brunch but again it's

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.050 
texture on that brunch but again it's
easy<00:04:52.510> to<00:04:52.720> get<00:04:53.050> carried<00:04:53.410> away<00:04:53.500> and<00:04:53.890> do<00:04:54.610> too<00:04:54.850> much

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
easy to get carried away and do too much

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.410 
easy to get carried away and do too much
I<00:04:55.390> think<00:04:55.900> that's<00:04:56.200> about<00:04:56.560> right<00:04:57.190> at<00:04:57.430> splendido

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:58.420 
I think that's about right at splendido

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.870 
I think that's about right at splendido
and<00:04:58.750> here<00:04:59.620> you<00:04:59.710> can<00:04:59.860> see<00:05:00.040> this<00:05:00.190> effect<00:05:00.610> in<00:05:00.790> the

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
and here you can see this effect in the

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:14.970 
and here you can see this effect in the
context<00:05:01.330> of<00:05:01.480> the<00:05:01.570> finished<00:05:01.870> picture

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.040
