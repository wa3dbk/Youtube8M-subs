00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.960
 hello how about friends from mexico the halls 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.670
 they are andrÃ©s in this occasion good them 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.539
 we are going to teach another tutorial here but 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.520
 this is for the xbox set modules and 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.840
 In this case, we are going right now for the 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.300
 terms 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.949
 obvious is the first thing is to have the 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.150
 superuser here will leave you the same 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.560
 the link that you already know so you can 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.570
 install per user first if not 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.240
 you have it if you already have the following 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.670
 is to have installed the module is pau set 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.590
 same here I leave the link so that 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.660
 you know how to install it and I already have there 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.310
 another tutorial on how to install it and 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.420
 then we will install the application 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:49.910
 that exist is called amplified which 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.910
 let's download here from the place thor 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.590
 here is ok 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:02.790
 here they are called amplifies pater and not 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.190
 it is so a battery extension one 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.390
 Amplification or extension of battery 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.060
 done here is the specific you have to 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.030
 be a root user and we will install it 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:16.790
 not in this case I already have it installed 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:20.070
 so let's go straight and we'll go 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.430
 then here are the modules 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.430
 pause 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.780
 and here we're going to go here to the 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.430
 module section 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.320
 and in this case good, these are the ones that 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.630
 I'm using still trying right now 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.110
 still and we are going to give here to the 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.110
 popcorn 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.240
 ok we're going to activate it and we're going to 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.310
 go here behind res or framework and let's go 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.070
 to give the soft restart not then 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.680
 we need that 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.950
 the team reinitiate 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.620
 so that it saves the time that it acquires 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.600
 a new function that I'm activating 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.490
 and now we can start offering 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.930
 a little bit of better performance 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.210
 battery that is what I expect the same 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.210
 get the clone out here 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:22.020
 because we already have it here inside 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.410
 this now we are going to open the 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.410
 application 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.980
 in this case now we have we going to 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.480
 request good will verify that it is 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.310
 everything in order that the 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.530
 framework this Saturday the root and then 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.720
 that is now yes that activated the 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.959
 application once you have done that then 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.150
 is going to offer you this and what good 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.879
 what it does in a rough way is to handle 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.099
 weblogs and blogs obvious good if not 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:55.250
 you know what are the applications that 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:58.220
 they work in the background there's no 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.590
 applications that we say open facebook 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.930
 will leave you open there is something like that 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.269
 partial to restart them is not to be 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.129
 some other is in application 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.190
 quote that leaves google play trash equal to 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:12.410
 sometimes it leaves open some 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.530
 some applications like partially 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.090
 open so you can open them 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.560
 supposedly as fast as possible but 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.500
 this the only thing that does is to consume you 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.900
 bacterial then if you need that 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.670
 Well, this is what this is going to be. 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.770
 to be forcing closures 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.930
 to programs and other programs that do not 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:34.050
 we are using at the moment I have not 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.660
 said here and let's go here started here 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:39.510
 he marks us whitelock and here he will give us 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.060
 what is limiting us who wants what 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.700
 we can tighten here and it will give us 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.440
 a specification more or less there of what 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.300
 what you are using in this case is 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.569
 applications of the app store as they are 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:54.239
 had commented and the sierra this true 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:56.099
 number of times since you let me apply 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.510
 good rubbish applications but there are 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:59.760
 applications that at the time I 'm not 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:03.150
 using not like we can limit 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.670
 some good apps for this from 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.580
 these settings are not available anymore 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.799
 that you have to pay the good one makes a 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.680
 small donation not here says it 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:16.470
 limit is a cup of coffee here when you are 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.200
 to the programmer that would be fair and the 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.930
 day will allow us this 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.760
 manage now yes that in a more 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.460
 be 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.440
 more personalized the time I want 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.110
 that is active to the application once 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.480
 spent his time mela deactivates and so 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:37.580
 successively not then actually 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:39.439
 Well yes it's quite useful 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.530
 I found him in the forums 

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:44.060
 from ex dj quite recommended and we're going to 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.310
 see how it is going and we will be 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.460
 checking not then of by regret 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.900
 then now it would be everything and now 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.270
 yes we see each other in friends next 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.699
 do not forget to subscribe to like 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.590
 and share it equally if it serves you well 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:00.169
 comment and if it does not serve you equal to what 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.120
 better and we can command this doing something 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:04.219
 about it and here I'm going to search 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.259
 another application is similar in case this 

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:07.879
 It will not help much and see you in another 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:12.430
 next video friends you are fired you are 

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:12.430
 his friend Andrew until the next bye
