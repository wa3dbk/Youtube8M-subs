00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.689
 hi friends cooking to taste today 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.360
 let's cook something super simple is 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:21.640
 a noodle soup to children them 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.890
 love and some adults also here 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.130
 we have the ingredients is a tomato 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:30.279
 it's a quarter of onion half juice 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.469
 Chicken broth is half a clove of garlic and 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.809
 It is a small piece of serrano pepper 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:36.489
 If you like something to be left 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.070
 peaks and is the soup if you do not like it 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.440
 you add that chile we also have 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.629
 here is the one we already have on this side 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.780
 our frying pan with little oil that 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:49.420
 let's put to heat and here we have 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.460
 water I put it to heat so that 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.290
 add it to the blender and liquefy the 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.810
 ingredients and then add it to 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.570
 pan not so late in boiling but you 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.300
 you can add cold water no matter how 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.399
 that we have our noodle here 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.470
 you need thick or thin noodles 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:08.229
 those that you like we are going to use 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.780
 half sachet because it yields and yields 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.000
 pretty so let's start and 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.970
 when these ingredients adding salt 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.860
 and also adding a little water 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.750
 while it goes cooking we will see 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.700
 If you need more water if you like it 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.220
 with a lot of soup, you can 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.080
 add more water and if not, you can 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.560
 leave so we start liquefying 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.670
 our ingredients 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.100
 I would add the salt here 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.479
 at once so that the flavor is impregnated 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.950
 of salt with all the ingredients 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.840
 while liquefying them 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.850
 and then if he needs it then 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.850
 I add higher and ready 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.080
 so let's liquefy the ingredients 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.090
 before browning our noodle 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.299
 oil and our pan is 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.060
 warming up but we started and when 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:01.200
 these ingredients here I have already liquefied 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:05.350
 the ingredients here we already have our 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.810
 broth for the noodle soup and for 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.350
 this side I have my pan is already 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:14.670
 we heat the oil 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:17.370
 I will adore the video here and this recipe 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.480
 they do not really drink and I do not think ten 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.060
 super simple minutes 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.970
 so that you give your children to the children 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.220
 generally like noodle soup 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.230
 and you can also add chicken 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.760
 obviously but I'm not adding 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.190
 in these moments because I do not have support 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.530
 so this recipe is super simple 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.450
 and many people will make it from another 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.390
 but that's how I usually use 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:45.700
 do it so let's add our 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.700
 videos and worship 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.280
 I'll make soup because as poquita 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.849
 start in this little boy then not 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:04.270
 I want to add so much so that after 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:08.740
 do not fit the content here 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:11.760
 we're going to move it like that so it's brown 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.760
 in oil 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:18.700
 and we keep it that way by moving it because 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:21.580
 we want it to burn because after 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.739
 it may grip a medium rare flavor and 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.690
 You can also see very burned videos and not 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.620
 we want that we only want that 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:34.190
 grab a golden color 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.190
 so we're going to be fine with the earrings 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.280
 as you can see here I'm almost ready 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.680
 my video because I already grabbed a key 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.410
 golden is already golden brown we do not want 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.510
 it burns so 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.980
 you have to be careful with that because if 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.200
 the oil is very hot it's going to 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.420
 burn fast so you have to have 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.780
 good care is almost ready to 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.120
 add the tomato broth so I say 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.620
 me and you're ready to add it 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.440
 excuse my shots but I'm 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.300
 recording myself today doing everything and 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.710
 that's why it looks like this 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:12.530
 the very shaking shots here the 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:15.020
 I'm going to download all the noodles 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.120
 to cover them all with the caldito de 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.609
 tomato 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.290
 and then that's when I should add 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:25.170
 more water 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:28.440
 so that the whole video is covered 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:30.600
 and cook well we can add as 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.490
 I told you before the hot water 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.250
 you can boil water and so 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:40.580
 boil your noodle faster but if it is 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.580
 cool is also fine if you like it very 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.330
 very broth dictates the soup then 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.790
 add more water all you want 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.470
 but also do not add so much because 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.080
 if you will not lose the flavor of the tomato 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.840
 and the onion the ingredients so 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.419
 there you have to calculate that it is 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.100
 well your soup after it boils let's go 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:01.620
 to try to see if it is already good salt 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.060
 because we already added him when he and 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.330
 when the ingredients we had already 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.910
 added the salt remember here is my 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:11.250
 soup and has already boiled for about 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:14.580
 look how 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:17.100
 it is already well ready but like me 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.350
 I like the soup soup because I'm going 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:22.200
 to add more water 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:24.630
 so I add more water and then the 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.060
 field hockey for another little while but 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.460
 since it is practically already ready and 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:32.090
 has boiled but then if you add a 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:36.720
 little more water and wait for 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:39.210
 boil other minutitos more and smells good 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.080
 hopital rich are very simple but 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:45.460
 it smells good 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:49.419
 so once you 've boiled like 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:51.310
 we see here because we can already try it and 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:53.650
 if you already tried salt and it's okay 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.539
 perfect and if you need salt 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.699
 you can add more and just wait 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:06:01.120
 let it boil and if it is ready 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:04.030
 we serve and enjoy it we serve 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:06.430
 our soup plate and well this is 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:09.430
 cooking to taste thank you very much for 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:13.319
 see and we are seeing each other in the next 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.319
 video and enjoy our soup
