let me plug this light in and

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.560 
let me plug this light in and
demonstrate<00:00:53.670> some<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.940> flash<00:00:54.149> patterns

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.270 

we<00:00:57.629> have<00:00:57.750> over<00:00:57.989> 30<00:00:58.199> flash<00:00:58.559> patterns<00:00:59.010> in<00:00:59.190> this

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
we have over 30 flash patterns in this

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.639 
we have over 30 flash patterns in this
light<00:00:59.579> which<00:01:00.570> I'll<00:01:00.719> demonstrate<00:01:00.899> from<00:01:01.350> some

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
light which I'll demonstrate from some

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.319 
light which I'll demonstrate from some
of<00:01:01.710> them<00:01:01.829> for<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.100> now<00:01:02.219> we<00:01:02.820> have<00:01:03.030> straight

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
of them for you now we have straight

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.359 
of them for you now we have straight
just<00:01:03.660> solid<00:01:04.199> flashes<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:04.920> then<00:01:05.010> we<00:01:05.129> have<00:01:05.250> some

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
just solid flashes and then we have some

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.429 
just solid flashes and then we have some
rotating<00:01:05.790> patterns<00:01:06.180> which<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.780> can<00:01:06.990> see<00:01:07.170> here

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
rotating patterns which you can see here

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:16.370 
rotating patterns which you can see here
now<00:01:13.490> we<00:01:14.490> incorporated<00:01:15.060> quite<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.299> few<00:01:15.630> rotating

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
now we incorporated quite a few rotating

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.350 
now we incorporated quite a few rotating
patterns<00:01:16.830> into<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.369> beacon<00:01:17.700> I'm<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.909> big<00:01:18.150> fan

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
patterns into the beacon I'm a big fan

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.780 
patterns into the beacon I'm a big fan
of<00:01:18.390> rotators<00:01:19.009> so<00:01:20.009> we<00:01:20.130> want<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.400> quite<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.610> few

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
of rotators so we want it quite a few

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.039 
of rotators so we want it quite a few
patterns<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.240> would<00:01:21.360> rotate<00:01:21.570> there's<00:01:21.990> a

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
patterns that would rotate there's a

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.030 
patterns that would rotate there's a
really<00:01:22.320> fast<00:01:22.560> one<00:01:22.770> there<00:01:24.680> and<00:01:25.680> one<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.950> the

triple threat - light just came out is
this<00:01:33.240> pattern<00:01:33.659> similar<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.079> this<00:01:34.320> here<00:01:34.680> almost

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
this pattern similar to this here almost

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.890 
this pattern similar to this here almost
makes<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.640> look<00:01:35.729> like<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:36.030> rotator<00:01:36.540> but<00:01:36.780> it's

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
makes it look like a rotator but it's

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.649 
makes it look like a rotator but it's
it's<00:01:37.140> an<00:01:37.290> extremely<00:01:38.130> fast<00:01:38.310> rotator<00:01:38.850> but<00:01:39.509> it's

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
it's an extremely fast rotator but it's

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.030 
it's an extremely fast rotator but it's
also<00:01:39.810> doing<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.170> quad<00:01:40.380> flash<00:01:40.650> while<00:01:40.890> it's

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
also doing the quad flash while it's

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.160 
also doing the quad flash while it's
rotating<00:01:41.520> really<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.540> think<00:01:42.750> it's<00:01:42.930> gonna<00:01:43.020> be<00:01:43.140> a

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
rotating really I think it's gonna be a

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.520 
rotating really I think it's gonna be a
