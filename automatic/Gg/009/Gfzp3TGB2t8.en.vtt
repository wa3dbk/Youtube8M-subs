 I do not come to teach or lightning mcqueen nor to 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.870
 flash although I will leave you in the description 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.490
 the videos where I show it where we 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.080
 taught in case you want to see us and such and 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.490
 you know that all this you see but not 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.980
 say the video because you have it always 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.500
 in the channel I come to teach you another little thing 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.439
 another very interesting little thing and this is 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.140
 what are you going to see here pam pam pam miss 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.710
 As you can see , I did not kill him, but the 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.960
 I have electrocuted now that we killed her 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.610
 but electrocuted but today it is 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.190
 basically let's run around here 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.440
 lady that you can not escape us from 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.090
 flash there is as you see the electrocutó 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.219
 they come out like the typical rays that 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.719
 when electrocuted and all that and one 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.820
 Well, the truth is that as a 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.219
 You see, look how electrocutó is 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.320
 You already know how good it is because there is a 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.570
 weapon that yes that's electric makes 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.770
 well enough in gta that good 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.780
 because they are not online and such that has 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.149
 could put many times and all that 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.559
 is a pistolite that shoots very slowly and 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.020
 that you have to recharge very slowly that does not 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.489
 has reach because it is good 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.269
 people a little bit away because it does not reach them 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.550
 electrocuted to electricity and everything 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.290
 that but with this weapon so we're going 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.910
 to be able to do because good because it's the 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.770
 carbine basically has the range of 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.810
 the carbine that you can give to any 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.520
 basically distance and also throw in 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.800
 machine gun plan so it's a weapon 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.600
 electric wapa milk and that 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.710
 Well, it serves us a lot like 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.960
 Arabic I'm going to give you a little bit of the 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.700
 policemen have quiet companion or be 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.270
 you also calm as you see the 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.710
 electrocuted and just like enough 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.430
 partner and the most electrocutándolos the 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:38.270
 true that he is quite handsome enough not 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.670
 hello with another oven really if I took off 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.560
 life we do not tell each other the comments and 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.390
 with the electric weapon takes life or is not 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.370
 talk to him connects but good to 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.640
 end if you give 34 bullet weekend so 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.640
 they die 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.220
 and nothing because here you see simply 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.650
 we have to go towards what is the 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.590
 character and we see how around here 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.570
 we worry but exaggeratedly like x 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.170
 let's see in invincible mode because 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.180
 I want to mess it up a bit and basically 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.979
 I think that besides more that can not 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.500
 happen that more than anything flash that's 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.630
 unthinkable let's go here to mess it up a bit 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.030
 with people is that as I love or 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.000
 is it basically busting people 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.370
 As you can see, it will not be written, it's very good 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.060
 I see 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.769

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.190
 I can do here I think it looks 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.069
 pretty good I do not think I 'm trying to do more 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.390
 to light but let's that the element ones 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.549
 scratched that you're amazed what 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:41.310
 I do not know if I 'll kill her at all 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:44.010
 or not to see miss you hear miss 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:51.110
 in January 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:51.110
 hello hello 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:00.020
 Hello

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.799
 running 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.019
 but I think they have a shot in the 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.819
 my mother, my mother, how they are 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.909
 ask the lady let's go here 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.560
 I want to make some of the light and I want 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:15.599
 messing with him because he was not a policeman 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.890
 goodbye and I'm killing time at 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:20.430
 that would be nice you know what it is that 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.140
 put this thing that was electric or 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.700
 you imagine a rocket launcher 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.650
 that instead of doing this and exploiting 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.569
 even if it was a shock wave 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.640
 electrical that for example comes to you an 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.440
 surge of 10 people located so 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.870
 if you leave them all electrocuted, it's a 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.220
 serial to milk or I would love it if 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.890
 you can do with all the weapons with 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.569
 all weapons and for example in the 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.859
 proximity mines would also be very 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.989
 handsome that instead of exploding was 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.849
 electric you do not believe or it would be great 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.530
 the truth and I would love for example 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:48.030
 you put a mine a guy goes by and hit 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.859
 they are asked and everyone without 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.200
 get to kill him but it would be more more 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:53.640
 troll still would not fly quite like that 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.739
 that nothing because I would simply wait 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.870
 that they put it in fact I will try to do 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.400
 some suggestions somebody that 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.260
 know how to make these things so that 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.239
 that I can put it to see if it gives 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.680
 there he puts it and it is without any problem 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.090
 when that happens or I'll bring it to look at how much 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.310
 I'm going to plant Mr. Swamp 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:14.200
 hey are challenging flash 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.200
 then doing sir panton 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:20.879
 is challenging flash 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.700
 it was my mother uncle is challenging you pamper 

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:24.380
 maybe that's true 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.830
 seriously 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:30.250
 Yesterday serves so bad not being able to pay 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.250
 to a little 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:37.120
 my mother like studying her sir 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:39.300
 how much you can not escape before 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.300
 flash 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.169
 a genius escapes 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.729
 does not run runs back 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:58.120
 I have a partner now if you thought that 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.789
 I'm going to escape from flash but not flash 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.039
 it's faster and more bank too but 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:05.319
 nothing good happens total because nothing I 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:07.090
 as I said my idea the truth is that 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:08.469
 I think it would be pretty cool and if I 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.789
 they comment what you think but if everything 

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:12.460
 this type of rocket launchers and mines 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:14.800
 proximity could be turned into bullets 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.539
 electric that is the damn milk 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.949
 I would love the truth and in this 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:19.810
 so I hope you liked it in 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:21.370

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.810
 Little things you already know that I love teaching 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.460
 all these things and I love that it 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.539
 they love themselves too and nothing 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.520
 liked to pop the button there 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:29.880

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.520

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.380
 totally screwed me right now with that 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:40.730
 I blow up yes yes I do not have anything 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:43.730
