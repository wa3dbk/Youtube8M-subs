00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.389
 These burgers are made from chicken fillet. 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.629
 stuffed with butter and 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.450
 greens and so we need chicken 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:17.720
 fillet slice of butter clove 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.880
 garlic and a bunch of parsley 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.489
 First prepare the filling for this. 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.570
 chopped parsley and garlic and butter 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:30.619

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.130

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.130
