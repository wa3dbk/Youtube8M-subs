00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:53.710 
how I have it and its really really nice
one<00:01:52.820> of<00:01:52.880> the<00:01:52.970> other<00:01:53.090> cool<00:01:53.240> things<00:01:53.479> if<00:01:53.630> you

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
one of the other cool things if you

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.399 
one of the other cool things if you
haven't<00:01:53.990> noticed<00:01:54.020> in<00:01:54.470> any<00:01:54.679> of<00:01:54.829> the<00:01:54.979> previous

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
haven't noticed in any of the previous

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.359 
haven't noticed in any of the previous
trailers<00:01:57.409> and<00:01:57.590> I<00:01:57.619> think<00:01:57.829> they<00:01:57.920> show<00:01:58.069> this<00:01:58.220> off

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
trailers and I think they show this off

00:01:58.369 --> 00:01:59.859 
trailers and I think they show this off
in<00:01:58.549> at<00:01:58.670> least<00:01:58.759> one<00:01:59.000> of<00:01:59.030> them<00:01:59.179> there's<00:01:59.360> stamps

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
in at least one of them there's stamps

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.809 
in at least one of them there's stamps
now<00:02:00.049> I<00:02:00.350> think<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:00.860> stamps<00:02:01.189> are<00:02:01.340> for<00:02:01.490> use<00:02:01.640> in

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:01.819 
now I think the stamps are for use in

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:03.100 
now I think the stamps are for use in
the<00:02:01.939> me<00:02:02.119> verse<00:02:02.270> posts<00:02:02.720> which<00:02:02.840> have<00:02:02.990> been

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
the me verse posts which have been

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.469 
the me verse posts which have been
turned<00:02:03.380> off<00:02:03.590> at<00:02:04.250> this<00:02:04.520> point<00:02:04.759> I<00:02:04.880> can't<00:02:04.909> make<00:02:05.270> me

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479
