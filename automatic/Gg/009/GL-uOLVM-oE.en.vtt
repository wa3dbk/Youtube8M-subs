00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.149 
hacking and I found that the key to
hacking<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.140> have<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.470> have<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.650> perfect

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
hacking is you have to have a perfect

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.130

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.609 
line of sight to the object that you're
hacking<00:01:40.380> now<00:01:41.220> this<00:01:41.430> is<00:01:41.610> interesting<00:01:41.640> because

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
hacking now this is interesting because

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.639

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
if you need to say hack into a safe in a

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.920 
if you need to say hack into a safe in a
bank<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.220> can<00:01:47.549> go<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:47.939> know<00:01:48.299> your<00:01:48.600> typical

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
bank you can go you know your typical

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.230 
bank you can go you know your typical
running<00:01:49.890> they're<00:01:50.100> beat-up<00:01:50.460> bunch<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:51.060> guards

running they're beat-up bunch of guards
and<00:01:51.540> then<00:01:51.659> get<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.990> safe<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.590> have<00:01:52.680> a

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
and then get to the safe so you have a

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.280 
and then get to the safe so you have a
clear<00:01:53.009> line<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.189> sight<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:54.090> safe<00:01:54.390> or<00:01:54.659> if

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
clear line of sight to the safe or if

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.260

that so you

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.740 
that so you
pretty<00:02:11.830> much<00:02:11.950> daisy<00:02:12.250> chain<00:02:12.610> your<00:02:12.819> way<00:02:12.910> through

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:18.629 
hack them anymore and you fail the
mission<00:05:16.539> so<00:05:17.139> there's<00:05:17.289> pretty<00:05:17.469> much<00:05:17.529> two<00:05:17.919> ways

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
mission so there's pretty much two ways

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:21.719 
mission so there's pretty much two ways
this<00:05:18.879> can<00:05:18.940> end<00:05:19.300> the<00:05:19.900> the<00:05:20.529> intruder<00:05:21.009> will<00:05:21.340> find

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:21.729 
this can end the the intruder will find

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:24.119 
this can end the the intruder will find
you<00:05:21.969> and<00:05:22.210> kill<00:05:22.479> you<00:05:22.509> or<00:05:22.840> you<00:05:23.349> hack<00:05:23.620> their<00:05:23.860> stuff

00:05:24.119 --> 00:05:24.129 
you and kill you or you hack their stuff

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:26.550 
you and kill you or you hack their stuff
and<00:05:24.370> you<00:05:24.580> make<00:05:24.759> a<00:05:24.789> getaway<00:05:25.379> now<00:05:26.379> obviously

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
and you make a getaway now obviously

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.459 
and you make a getaway now obviously
this<00:05:26.949> is<00:05:27.129> vice<00:05:27.370> versa<00:05:27.729> if<00:05:28.060> you<00:05:28.300> decide<00:05:29.110> to

00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:29.469
