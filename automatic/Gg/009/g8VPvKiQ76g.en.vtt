he'll actually roll that car and a
little<00:01:02.370> bit<00:01:02.460> farther<00:01:02.970> when<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.510> stage<00:01:03.780> light

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
little bit farther when that stage light

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.899 
little bit farther when that stage light
comes<00:01:04.290> on<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.559> what<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.890> does<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.670> gets

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
comes on and what that does is it gets

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.370 
comes on and what that does is it gets
you<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.119> little<00:01:06.390> bit<00:01:06.479> closer<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.020> actual

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
you a little bit closer to the actual

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.630 
you a little bit closer to the actual
starting<00:01:07.890> lines<00:01:08.039> when<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.310> have<00:01:08.399> to<00:01:08.490> throttle

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640

the<00:01:08.759> card<00:01:09.000> on<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.240> travel<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.720> far<00:01:09.960> gives<00:01:10.590> you

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
the card on that travel is far gives you

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.859 
the card on that travel is far gives you
a<00:01:10.710> better<00:01:10.920> reaction<00:01:11.340> time<00:01:11.789> but<00:01:12.390> then<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.690> takes

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
a better reaction time but then it takes

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.480 
a better reaction time but then it takes
away<00:01:13.200> from<00:01:13.410> your<00:01:13.560> lap<00:01:13.740> time<00:01:14.009> so<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.220> kind<00:01:14.430> of

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
away from your lap time so you kind of

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.040 
away from your lap time so you kind of
swapping<00:01:14.820> numbers<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.360> little<00:01:15.570> but<00:01:15.780> it's<00:01:15.869> kinda

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
swapping numbers a little but it's kinda

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.660 
swapping numbers a little but it's kinda
like<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.170> politician<00:01:16.560> talking<00:01:17.280> about<00:01:17.520> the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
like a politician talking about the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.190 
like a politician talking about the
budget<00:01:17.910> they<00:01:18.210> just<00:01:18.390> put<00:01:18.600> those<00:01:18.750> numbers<00:01:18.930> to

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
budget they just put those numbers to

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.930 
budget they just put those numbers to
make<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.470> look<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.770> wow<00:01:19.920> they<00:01:20.340> want<00:01:20.550> to<00:01:20.729> look

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
make it look the wow they want to look

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.090 
make it look the wow they want to look
so<00:01:21.270> he<00:01:21.720> kind<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.020> got<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.259> pay<00:01:22.410> attention<00:01:22.440> to<00:01:23.009> it

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
so he kind of got to pay attention to it

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.950 
so he kind of got to pay attention to it
as<00:01:23.190> a<00:01:23.220> crew<00:01:23.520> chief<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.910> drivers<00:01:24.390> man<00:01:24.780> I

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
as a crew chief and drivers man I

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.800 
as a crew chief and drivers man I
believed<00:01:25.410> all<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:25.820> on<00:01:26.820> both<00:01:27.030> sides<00:01:27.420> you

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
believed all that on both sides you

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.779 
believed all that on both sides you
don't<00:01:27.929> think<00:01:28.050> a<00:01:28.080> politician<00:01:28.560> would<00:01:28.619> lie<00:01:28.830> do<00:01:29.160> no

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789
