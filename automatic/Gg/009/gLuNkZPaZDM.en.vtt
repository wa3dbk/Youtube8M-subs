00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
need to get a MOAB on uninfected and I

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.210 
need to get a MOAB on uninfected and I
will<00:00:21.630> have<00:00:21.779> them<00:00:21.930> all<00:00:22.080> so<00:00:22.920> we're<00:00:23.070> getting

where<00:00:25.980> it's<00:00:26.160> just<00:00:26.250> pretty<00:00:26.730> difficult<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.390> get

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
where it's just pretty difficult to get

am<00:00:33.180> very<00:00:33.600> surprised<00:00:34.110> that<00:00:34.230> ended<00:00:34.559> up<00:00:34.590> getting

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
am very surprised that ended up getting

am very surprised that ended up getting
a<00:00:34.950> MOAB<00:00:35.100> this<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.180> probably<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.870> sloppiest

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
a MOAB this is probably the sloppiest

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.130 
a MOAB this is probably the sloppiest
moab<00:00:38.129> i<00:00:38.309> have<00:00:38.460> ever<00:00:38.700> gotten<00:00:39.030> infected<00:00:39.719> and

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
moab i have ever gotten infected and

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.530 
moab i have ever gotten infected and
it's<00:00:40.620> definitely<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:42.000> only<00:00:42.390> episode

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
it's definitely the the only episode

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.720 
it's definitely the the only episode
that<00:00:43.079> I've<00:00:43.170> run<00:00:43.440> around<00:00:43.739> essentially<00:00:44.579> the

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
that I've run around essentially the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.110 
that I've run around essentially the
entire<00:00:44.850> game<00:00:45.770> very<00:00:46.770> rarely<00:00:47.100> in<00:00:47.489> this<00:00:47.730> game<00:00:47.910> am

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
entire game very rarely in this game am

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.940 
entire game very rarely in this game am
I<00:00:48.239> in<00:00:48.360> one<00:00:48.570> spot<00:00:48.899> for<00:00:48.960> longer<00:00:49.620> than<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.829> would

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
I in one spot for longer than I would

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.310 
I in one spot for longer than I would
say<00:00:50.129> 15<00:00:50.370> seconds<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.270> hold<00:00:51.750> down<00:00:51.899> different

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
say 15 seconds I hold down different

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.410 
say 15 seconds I hold down different
areas<00:00:52.680> but<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:53.010> am<00:00:53.129> constantly<00:00:53.820> running<00:00:54.059> around

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
areas but I am constantly running around

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.479 
areas but I am constantly running around
and<00:00:54.660> my<00:00:55.199> strategy<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:55.890> particular<00:00:56.160> game

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
and my strategy in this particular game

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.049 
and my strategy in this particular game
was<00:00:56.969> completely<00:00:57.690> opposite<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.379> anything<00:00:59.340> that

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
was completely opposite of anything that

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.240 
was completely opposite of anything that
I<00:01:00.120> do<00:01:00.180> in<00:01:00.359> my<00:01:00.390> infected<00:01:00.780> by<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.020> MOAB<00:01:01.379> series<00:01:01.739> the

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
I do in my infected by a MOAB series the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.369 
I do in my infected by a MOAB series the
strategy<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:02.820> i'm<00:01:03.030> using<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.510> tactics<00:01:04.080> I

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
strategy that i'm using the tactics I

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.469 
strategy that i'm using the tactics I
mean<00:01:04.650> basically<00:01:05.070> from<00:01:05.640> start<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.000> finish<00:01:06.299> I'm

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
mean basically from start to finish I'm

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.359 
mean basically from start to finish I'm
breaking<00:01:06.900> all<00:01:07.020> my<00:01:07.080> own<00:01:07.380> rules<00:01:08.040> throughout

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
breaking all my own rules throughout

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.399 
breaking all my own rules throughout
this<00:01:08.580> game<00:01:08.760> I'm<00:01:09.270> very<00:01:09.570> surprised<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.229> got

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
this game I'm very surprised that I got

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.730 
this game I'm very surprised that I got
the<00:01:10.500> Moab<00:01:11.420> this<00:01:12.420> middle<00:01:12.750> area<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:13.229> what<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.500> hold

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
the Moab this middle area is what I hold

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.320 
the Moab this middle area is what I hold
down<00:01:13.920> for<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.250> most<00:01:14.490> part<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:15.000> would<00:01:15.150> not

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
down for the most part and I would not

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.270 
down for the most part and I would not
recommend<00:01:15.509> being<00:01:16.020> over<00:01:16.320> here<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.950> can<00:01:17.100> see

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
recommend being over here you can see

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.249 
recommend being over here you can see
there<00:01:17.520> are<00:01:17.549> multiple<00:01:18.119> entry<00:01:18.570> ways<00:01:18.750> for<00:01:19.080> the

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
there are multiple entry ways for the

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.380 
there are multiple entry ways for the
infected<00:01:19.830> right<00:01:20.610> down<00:01:20.759> there<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.150> going<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.360> be

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
infected right down there is going to be

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.120 
infected right down there is going to be
the<00:01:21.540> most<00:01:21.659> common<00:01:22.140> but<00:01:22.259> right<00:01:22.439> behind<00:01:22.590> me<00:01:22.920> see

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
the most common but right behind me see

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.770 
the most common but right behind me see
is<00:01:23.220> also<00:01:23.460> very<00:01:23.670> dangerous<00:01:24.180> because<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.360> second

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
is also very dangerous because a second

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.499 
is also very dangerous because a second
you<00:01:24.840> turn<00:01:24.990> your<00:01:25.229> back<00:01:25.759> there's<00:01:26.759> at<00:01:26.970> least<00:01:27.000> two

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
you turn your back there's at least two

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.420 
you turn your back there's at least two
spawn<00:01:27.810> points<00:01:28.170> behind<00:01:28.290> me<00:01:28.590> right<00:01:28.619> there<00:01:28.740> that

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
spawn points behind me right there that

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.179 
spawn points behind me right there that
the<00:01:29.790> infected<00:01:30.270> will<00:01:30.600> spawn<00:01:31.049> on<00:01:31.259> after<00:01:32.070> they

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
the infected will spawn on after they

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.620 
the infected will spawn on after they
die<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:32.670> it's<00:01:32.820> one<00:01:32.970> thing<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.180> keep<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.570> mind

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
die so it's one thing to keep in mind

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.719 
die so it's one thing to keep in mind
you<00:01:34.380> need<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.650> have<00:01:34.829> people<00:01:35.009> constantly

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
you need to have people constantly

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.480 
you need to have people constantly

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
would guard this area right over here

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.810 
would guard this area right over here
that's<00:01:40.500> where<00:01:40.740> most<00:01:40.920> people<00:01:41.310> go<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.490> I'll<00:01:41.729> go

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
okay this tunnel right here is a great

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.690 
okay this tunnel right here is a great
spot<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.409> get<00:01:52.619> kills<00:01:52.829> as<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.100> can<00:01:53.220> see<00:01:53.340> most<00:01:53.579> of

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
spot to get kills as you can see most of

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.920 
spot to get kills as you can see most of
the<00:01:53.820> infected<00:01:54.090> like<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.450> line<00:01:54.630> up<00:01:54.750> here

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
the infected like the line up here

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.060 
the infected like the line up here
because<00:01:54.990> it's<00:01:55.259> usually<00:01:55.380> three<00:01:55.770> or<00:01:55.799> four

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
because it's usually three or four

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.100 
because it's usually three or four
people<00:01:56.219> around<00:01:57.119> this<00:01:57.270> tunnel<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:57.750> attract

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
people around this tunnel and attract

people around this tunnel and attract
see<00:01:58.259> infected<00:01:58.740> but<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.729> thing<00:01:59.880> about<00:01:59.909> that

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
see infected but the thing about that

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.359 
see infected but the thing about that
tunnel<00:02:00.750> is<00:02:00.899> your<00:02:01.049> very<00:02:01.290> susceptible<00:02:01.799> throwing

the<00:02:17.010> tunnel<00:02:17.340> this<00:02:17.459> area<00:02:17.760> right<00:02:17.879> here<00:02:17.939> is

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
the tunnel this area right here is

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.339 
the tunnel this area right here is
always<00:02:18.420> talking<00:02:18.629> about<00:02:18.840> if<00:02:18.959> you<00:02:19.049> can<00:02:19.200> hold

down this area you're gonna have a much

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.020 
down this area you're gonna have a much
easier<00:02:21.930> time<00:02:22.319> there's<00:02:22.799> basically<00:02:22.980> two<00:02:23.280> main

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
easier time there's basically two main

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.850 
easier time there's basically two main
entrances<00:02:24.629> that<00:02:24.689> the<00:02:24.989> infected<00:02:25.470> can<00:02:25.680> come

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
matthieu is basically this side and then

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
toward the tunnel area and that's

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.580 
toward the tunnel area and that's
usually<00:02:33.030> what<00:02:33.569> I<00:02:33.599> like<00:02:33.840> to<00:02:33.959> do<00:02:34.079> and<00:02:34.260> right<00:02:34.379> here

still running around and I should not be
running<00:02:48.420> around<00:02:48.750> this<00:02:48.900> much<00:02:49.109> like<00:02:49.500> I<00:02:49.560> said<00:02:49.769> I'm

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
running around this much like I said I'm

breaking<00:02:50.220> all<00:02:50.310> my<00:02:50.370> rules<00:02:50.549> but<00:02:51.329> the<00:02:51.450> fact<00:02:51.659> that

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
breaking all my rules but the fact that

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.240 
breaking all my rules but the fact that
I<00:02:51.840> was<00:02:52.049> aggressive<00:02:52.650> throughout<00:02:52.920> this<00:02:53.040> game<00:02:53.190> I

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
I was aggressive throughout this game I

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.309 
I was aggressive throughout this game I
got<00:02:53.549> twice<00:02:53.879> as<00:02:53.909> many<00:02:54.180> kills<00:02:54.480> as<00:02:54.690> anybody<00:02:55.139> else

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
got twice as many kills as anybody else

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.770 
got twice as many kills as anybody else
and<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:56.040> was<00:02:56.159> because<00:02:56.489> I<00:02:56.519> was<00:02:57.030> aggressive<00:02:57.629> and

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
and it was because I was aggressive and

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.930 
and it was because I was aggressive and
aggression<00:02:58.409> really<00:02:58.889> does<00:02:59.069> help<00:02:59.310> and<00:02:59.519> infected
