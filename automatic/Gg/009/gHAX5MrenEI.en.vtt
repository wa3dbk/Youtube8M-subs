00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
alright Chad here decided to do a quick

alright Chad here decided to do a quick
video<00:00:02.820> on<00:00:03.440> reviewing<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:04.859> new<00:00:05.750> nike<00:00:06.830> metcon

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
video on reviewing the new nike metcon

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.120 
video on reviewing the new nike metcon
ones<00:00:08.220> versus<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.240> nanos<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:10.349> I<00:00:10.769> decided<00:00:11.010> to

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
ones versus the nanos and I decided to

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.910 
ones versus the nanos and I decided to
do<00:00:11.280> it<00:00:11.370> because<00:00:12.110> most<00:00:13.110> of<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.349> videos<00:00:13.650> I've

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
do it because most of the videos I've

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.750 
do it because most of the videos I've
seen<00:00:14.219> out<00:00:14.400> there<00:00:14.580> on<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:15.000> Mekons<00:00:15.450> have<00:00:16.139> been

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
seen out there on the Mekons have been

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.010 
seen out there on the Mekons have been
neglecting<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.880> few<00:00:18.119> of<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.359> points<00:00:18.600> that<00:00:18.810> I've

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
neglecting a few of the points that I've

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.910 
neglecting a few of the points that I've
noticed<00:00:19.430> after<00:00:20.430> i<00:00:20.699> purchased<00:00:21.060> them<00:00:21.420> so<00:00:22.109> here's

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
noticed after i purchased them so here's

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.370 
noticed after i purchased them so here's
a<00:00:23.010> metcon<00:00:23.430> ones<00:00:23.699> I<00:00:23.880> just<00:00:23.910> got<00:00:24.240> them<00:00:24.359> last<00:00:25.109> week

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
a metcon ones I just got them last week

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.780 
a metcon ones I just got them last week
and<00:00:27.260> here<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.500> my<00:00:29.189> my<00:00:30.029> older<00:00:30.359> nanos<00:00:30.929> nano<00:00:31.380> fours

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:31.790 
and here is my my older nanos nano fours

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.430 
and here is my my older nanos nano fours
so<00:00:32.790> one<00:00:33.630> of<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.809> first<00:00:33.840> things<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.410> noticed

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
so one of the first things I noticed

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.040 
so one of the first things I noticed
about<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.070> metcon<00:00:35.430> ones<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:36.030> that<00:00:36.120> they're

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
about the metcon ones is that they're

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.170 
about the metcon ones is that they're
very<00:00:37.079> flat<00:00:38.070> on<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.460> bottom<00:00:40.670> there<00:00:41.670> another<00:00:41.969> a

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
very flat on the bottom there another a

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.600 
very flat on the bottom there another a
little<00:00:42.540> bit<00:00:42.660> look<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.140> less<00:00:43.290> flexible<00:00:43.920> as<00:00:44.129> you

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
little bit look the less flexible as you

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.900 
little bit look the less flexible as you
might<00:00:45.000> can<00:00:45.180> see<00:00:45.420> here<00:00:45.750> then<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:47.219> nanos<00:00:47.610> these

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
might can see here then the nanos these

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.250 
might can see here then the nanos these
are<00:00:48.030> obviously<00:00:48.360> broken<00:00:48.660> in<00:00:49.760> so<00:00:51.170> depending<00:00:52.170> on

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
are obviously broken in so depending on

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.450 
are obviously broken in so depending on
what<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.739> want<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:53.070> use<00:00:53.190> them<00:00:53.370> for<00:00:55.460> the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
what you want to use them for the

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.049 
what you want to use them for the
flexibility<00:00:57.149> might<00:00:57.360> come<00:00:57.930> become<00:00:58.350> an<00:00:58.469> issue<00:00:58.620> I

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
flexibility might come become an issue I

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.460 
flexibility might come become an issue I
on<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.090> other<00:01:00.180> hand<00:01:00.590> prefer<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.969> flatness<00:01:02.969> I

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
on the other hand prefer the flatness I

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.160 
on the other hand prefer the flatness I
feel<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.500> lot<00:01:04.769> more<00:01:04.949> stable<00:01:05.430> in<00:01:05.850> these<00:01:06.150> when<00:01:06.990> I'm

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
feel a lot more stable in these when I'm

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.840 
feel a lot more stable in these when I'm
doing<00:01:07.350> my<00:01:07.860> Olympic<00:01:08.700> lifting<00:01:09.740> they<00:01:10.740> also<00:01:10.950> are<00:01:11.460> a

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
doing my Olympic lifting they also are a

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.190 
doing my Olympic lifting they also are a
bit<00:01:12.210> narrower<00:01:12.810> in<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:14.450> mid<00:01:15.450> section<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.990> your

he's known for having really narrow
shoes<00:01:37.700> in<00:01:38.700> my<00:01:38.850> case<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.299> like<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.840> narrowness

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
shoes in my case I like the narrowness

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.830 
shoes in my case I like the narrowness
around<00:01:40.759> the<00:01:41.759> ankle<00:01:42.270> level<00:01:42.869> ankle<00:01:43.409> area<00:01:43.560> and

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
around the ankle level ankle area and

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.429 
around the ankle level ankle area and
we're<00:01:45.840> on<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.079> mid-foot<00:01:47.960> one<00:01:48.960> thing<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.409> I

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
we're on the mid-foot one thing that I

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.950 
we're on the mid-foot one thing that I
have<00:01:49.590> noticed<00:01:50.009> with<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:51.030> shoe<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.720> don't

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
have noticed with the shoe and I don't

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.539 
have noticed with the shoe and I don't
know<00:01:52.079> if<00:01:52.170> it's<00:01:52.290> because<00:01:52.380> i<00:01:52.590> bought<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.920> size<00:01:53.220> too

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
know if it's because i bought a size too

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:00.859 
know if it's because i bought a size too
big<00:01:53.579> is<00:01:54.470> that<00:01:55.470> um<00:01:57.710> when<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.740> where<00:01:59.600> formid<00:02:00.600> very

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
big is that um when I where formid very

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.760 
big is that um when I where formid very
small<00:02:01.200> socks<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.829> can<00:02:02.579> feel<00:02:03.259> the<00:02:04.259> back<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.530> my

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
small socks I can feel the back of my

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.139 
small socks I can feel the back of my
foot<00:02:05.689> sliding<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:07.049> tad<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.849> that<00:02:08.849> might<00:02:09.030> be

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
foot sliding a tad and that might be

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.690 
foot sliding a tad and that might be
because<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.539> bought<00:02:09.569> a<00:02:09.750> size<00:02:10.050> too<00:02:10.349> big<00:02:10.459> so<00:02:11.459> these

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
because I bought a size too big so these

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.759 
because I bought a size too big so these
are<00:02:11.760> 12<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.450> half

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
are 12 and a half

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.789 
are 12 and a half
and<00:02:14.769> these<00:02:14.860> are<00:02:14.920> 13<00:02:15.659> I<00:02:16.659> was<00:02:17.079> reading<00:02:17.650> that

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
and these are 13 I was reading that

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:21.479 
and these are 13 I was reading that
these<00:02:18.040> run<00:02:18.430> a<00:02:18.459> little<00:02:18.640> small<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:20.010> I<00:02:21.010> have<00:02:21.280> not

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
these run a little small and I have not

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.979 
these run a little small and I have not
found<00:02:21.730> that<00:02:21.849> to<00:02:21.939> be<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.180> case<00:02:24.299> it<00:02:25.299> might<00:02:25.720> be

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
found that to be the case it might be

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.160 
found that to be the case it might be
accurate<00:02:26.500> in<00:02:26.709> terms<00:02:26.739> of<00:02:27.250> length<00:02:27.519> of<00:02:27.760> your<00:02:27.909> foot

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
accurate in terms of length of your foot

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:35.039 
accurate in terms of length of your foot
but<00:02:29.170> in<00:02:29.290> terms<00:02:29.319> of<00:02:31.349> width<00:02:32.519> it<00:02:33.519> seems<00:02:34.180> you<00:02:34.930> know

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
but in terms of width it seems you know

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:39.839 
but in terms of width it seems you know
about<00:02:35.260> accurate<00:02:37.859> usually<00:02:38.859> 13s<00:02:39.459> are<00:02:39.549> a<00:02:39.579> little

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
about accurate usually 13s are a little

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.830 
about accurate usually 13s are a little
big<00:02:40.090> for<00:02:40.120> me<00:02:40.859> with<00:02:41.859> these<00:02:42.450> they're<00:02:43.450> about

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
big for me with these they're about

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.520 
big for me with these they're about
right<00:02:44.909> so<00:02:45.909> maybe<00:02:46.510> there<00:02:46.750> is<00:02:46.870> some<00:02:47.079> legitimacy

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
right so maybe there is some legitimacy

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.059 
right so maybe there is some legitimacy
to<00:02:47.680> those<00:02:47.950> claims<00:02:48.629> only<00:02:49.629> anything<00:02:50.019> else<00:02:50.200> uh<00:02:50.409> I

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
to those claims only anything else uh I

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.190 
to those claims only anything else uh I
don't<00:02:51.489> do<00:02:51.849> rope<00:02:52.030> line<00:02:52.239> very<00:02:52.480> much<00:02:52.720> but<00:02:52.900> I<00:02:52.959> have

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
don't do rope line very much but I have

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.649 
don't do rope line very much but I have
heard<00:02:53.349> people<00:02:53.500> say<00:02:53.829> that<00:02:53.980> these<00:02:54.359> ridges<00:02:55.359> here

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:55.659 
heard people say that these ridges here

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:00.270 
heard people say that these ridges here
provides<00:02:56.260> some<00:02:56.849> grip<00:02:58.349> over<00:02:59.349> all<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.889> entire

technology<00:03:03.480> it<00:03:04.480> feels<00:03:04.840> just<00:03:04.989> like<00:03:07.980> like<00:03:08.980> a

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010

coating of plastic not plastic it feels

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:15.809 
coating of plastic not plastic it feels
more<00:03:14.109> like<00:03:14.170> a<00:03:14.409> fabric<00:03:14.650> that<00:03:14.799> plastic<00:03:15.400> it<00:03:15.549> gives

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819

more like a fabric that plastic it gives

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:19.419 
it some texture it I like it it feels

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:22.710 
it some texture it I like it it feels
pretty<00:03:19.690> nice<00:03:19.959> and<00:03:21.120> supposedly<00:03:22.120> these<00:03:22.419> have

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 
more more breathability than the nanos I

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:28.199 
more more breathability than the nanos I
have<00:03:26.349> a<00:03:26.379> hard<00:03:26.650> time<00:03:26.829> believing<00:03:27.010> that<00:03:27.340> because

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
have a hard time believing that because

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.509 
have a hard time believing that because
the<00:03:28.510> nanos<00:03:28.840> have<00:03:29.250> more<00:03:30.540> openings<00:03:31.540> in<00:03:31.840> their

the nanos have more openings in their

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
the metcon ones because that the

the metcon ones because that the
stability<00:03:46.870> that<00:03:46.900> they<00:03:47.199> provide<00:03:47.590> make<00:03:48.459> me<00:03:48.609> feel

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
stability that they provide make me feel

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.240 
stability that they provide make me feel
a<00:03:48.790> lot<00:03:48.909> more<00:03:48.970> comfortable<00:03:49.329> I<00:03:49.949> haven't<00:03:50.949> run<00:03:51.129> in

a lot more comfortable I haven't run in

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:59.309 
a lot more comfortable I haven't run in
them<00:03:51.400> yet<00:03:51.780> but<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:54.299> heel-to-toe<00:03:55.799> drop<00:03:58.319> feels

them yet but the heel-to-toe drop feels

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.949 
them yet but the heel-to-toe drop feels
a<00:03:59.829> slight<00:04:00.459> bit<00:04:00.669> more<00:04:01.000> than<00:04:01.329> the<00:04:01.419> nanos<00:04:01.780> I've

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
a slight bit more than the nanos I've

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.430 
a slight bit more than the nanos I've
read<00:04:02.829> that<00:04:03.129> the<00:04:03.459> helo<00:04:03.669> to<00:04:03.879> drop<00:04:03.909> is<00:04:04.389> the<00:04:05.139> same

read that the helo to drop is the same

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.949 
read that the helo to drop is the same
in<00:04:05.470> both<00:04:06.209> but<00:04:07.209> I<00:04:07.239> have<00:04:07.299> a<00:04:07.449> hard<00:04:07.690> time<00:04:07.840> believing

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
in both but I have a hard time believing

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.159 
in both but I have a hard time believing
that<00:04:08.579> um<00:04:09.579> if<00:04:09.909> there<00:04:10.269> is<00:04:10.419> a<00:04:10.449> difference<00:04:10.840> is<00:04:11.019> not

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:11.169 
that um if there is a difference is not

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:14.839 
that um if there is a difference is not
very<00:04:11.500> much<00:04:11.739> but<00:04:12.269> because<00:04:13.269> of<00:04:13.299> the<00:04:13.510> way<00:04:13.690> the

very much but because of the way the

I<00:04:27.510> there<00:04:28.510> is<00:04:28.690> almost<00:04:29.530> there's<00:04:30.310> very<00:04:30.580> little

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
I there is almost there's very little

I there is almost there's very little

arch support in the nanos but in the

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.180 
arch support in the nanos but in the
Mexican<00:04:36.490> ones<00:04:37.000> there<00:04:37.330> is<00:04:37.600> a<00:04:37.630> bit<00:04:38.080> more<00:04:38.380> it

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
Mexican ones there is a bit more it

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.280 
Mexican ones there is a bit more it
comes<00:04:39.550> up<00:04:39.760> on<00:04:39.910> the<00:04:39.970> inside<00:04:40.480> of<00:04:40.510> your<00:04:40.720> foot<00:04:40.990> a

comes up on the inside of your foot a

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.810 
comes up on the inside of your foot a
bit<00:04:42.280> more<00:04:42.700> and<00:04:43.200> it's<00:04:44.200> not<00:04:44.530> dramatic<00:04:45.130> but<00:04:45.669> it's

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
bit more and it's not dramatic but it's

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.170 
bit more and it's not dramatic but it's
enough<00:04:46.090> for<00:04:46.120> me<00:04:46.360> to<00:04:46.720> be<00:04:47.650> cognizant<00:04:48.190> of<00:04:48.490> the

providing aesthetically I CrossFit but

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.480 
so i don't really like to wear my nanos
out<00:05:04.390> too<00:05:04.810> much<00:05:04.990> because<00:05:05.230> the<00:05:05.620> very<00:05:05.860> they're
