00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
thing not even the mega evolution

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.060 
thing not even the mega evolution
versions<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.670> think<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.600> e<00:01:12.630> exes<00:01:13.200> are<00:01:13.470> so

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
versions I think of the e exes are so

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.609 
versions I think of the e exes are so
that's<00:01:14.640> kind<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.850> cool<00:01:15.090> thing<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.470> thought

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
that's kind of cool thing and I thought

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.070 
that's kind of cool thing and I thought
just<00:01:17.159> mentioned<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:17.700> seeing<00:01:18.119> as<00:01:18.240> we<00:01:18.420> were

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
just mentioned that seeing as we were

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.830 
just mentioned that seeing as we were
you<00:01:19.290> know<00:01:19.439> we<00:01:20.009> had<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:20.520> got<00:01:21.210> this<00:01:21.360> before<00:01:21.689> so

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
you know we had a I got this before so

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.210 
you know we had a I got this before so
that's<00:01:21.990> kind<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.200> cool<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.500> get<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.680> secret<00:01:23.040> rare

that's kind of cool to get a secret rare
there's<00:01:23.580> obviously<00:01:23.700> also<00:01:25.700> let<00:01:26.700> me<00:01:26.729> have<00:01:26.880> a

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
there's obviously also let me have a

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.590 
there's obviously also let me have a
look<00:01:27.030> I<00:01:27.210> think<00:01:27.420> there's<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:28.070> zealous<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.600> Venus

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
look I think there's a zealous and Venus

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.020 
look I think there's a zealous and Venus
or<00:01:30.750> as<00:01:30.930> well<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.560> believe<00:01:32.159> there's<00:01:32.340> also<00:01:32.460> a

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
or as well I believe there's also a

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.910 
or as well I believe there's also a
rainbow<00:01:33.600> energy<00:01:33.900> but<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.200> isn't<00:01:34.650> an

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
rainbow energy but that isn't an

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.380 
rainbow energy but that isn't an
uncommon<00:01:35.250> so<00:01:35.549> forget<00:01:35.970> what<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.119> just<00:01:36.180> said

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
uncommon so forget what I just said

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.050 
uncommon so forget what I just said
they're<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.780> one-hit<00:01:37.320> scary<00:01:37.619> ansari<00:01:38.060> equation

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
they're a one-hit scary ansari equation

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.170 
they're a one-hit scary ansari equation
x<00:01:40.159> continued<00:01:42.619> so<00:01:43.619> yeah<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.399> mega<00:01:44.610> evolution

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
x continued so yeah the mega evolution

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.010 
x continued so yeah the mega evolution
look<00:01:45.420> pretty<00:01:45.689> cool<00:01:46.460> from<00:01:47.460> what<00:01:47.579> I've<00:01:47.670> seen

intriguing<00:05:26.360> I<00:05:27.310> think<00:05:28.310> they've<00:05:28.430> like<00:05:28.729> done

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
intriguing I think they've like done

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.460 
intriguing I think they've like done
different<00:05:29.540> versions<00:05:29.900> of<00:05:29.960> the<00:05:30.080> villain<00:05:30.350> that's

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
different versions of the villain that's

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.219 
different versions of the villain that's
kind<00:05:30.680> of<00:05:30.710> cool<00:05:31.000> over<00:05:32.000> quick<00:05:32.150> look<00:05:32.330> yeah<00:05:33.050> it's

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:33.229 
kind of cool over quick look yeah it's

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:34.659 
kind of cool over quick look yeah it's
got<00:05:33.350> the<00:05:33.440> same<00:05:33.590> number<00:05:33.650> but<00:05:33.979> I<00:05:34.160> must<00:05:34.340> have<00:05:34.460> like

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669 
got the same number but I must have like

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:37.659 
got the same number but I must have like
different<00:05:35.090> kinds<00:05:36.010> that's<00:05:37.010> kind<00:05:37.190> of<00:05:37.220> cool<00:05:37.400> or

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:37.669 
different kinds that's kind of cool or

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:38.680 
different kinds that's kind of cool or
maybe<00:05:37.820> there's<00:05:38.030> just<00:05:38.090> like<00:05:38.360> two<00:05:38.540> different

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
maybe there's just like two different

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.020 
maybe there's just like two different
kinds<00:05:39.140> maybe<00:05:39.350> in<00:05:39.650> this<00:05:39.830> one<00:05:40.040> particularly<00:05:40.460> hmm

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.030 
kinds maybe in this one particularly hmm

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.240 
kinds maybe in this one particularly hmm
apparently<00:05:41.450> this<00:05:42.350> one<00:05:42.560> is<00:05:42.680> the<00:05:42.800> elegant

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
apparently this one is the elegant

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.130 
apparently this one is the elegant
pattern<00:05:43.610> but<00:05:43.760> the<00:05:43.820> other<00:05:44.000> one<00:05:44.210> was<00:05:44.720> a<00:05:44.750> meadow

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.140 
pattern but the other one was a meadow

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.500 
pattern but the other one was a meadow
pattern<00:05:45.830> but<00:05:46.550> that's<00:05:46.729> kind<00:05:46.910> of<00:05:46.970> cool<00:05:47.150> to<00:05:47.210> see

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
pattern but that's kind of cool to see

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.350 
pattern but that's kind of cool to see
and<00:05:47.720> a<00:05:47.810> by<00:05:47.960> sharp<00:05:48.260> there<00:05:48.500> cool<00:05:49.400> alright<00:05:50.240> well
