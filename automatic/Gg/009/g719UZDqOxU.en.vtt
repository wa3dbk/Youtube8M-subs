 I do not know what it is 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.730
 since 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.920
 suddenly 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.200
 we have to do not have to tax the 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.869
 qualities 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.020

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.020

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.579
 poblano poblano I lacked this respect 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.009
 very strong very strong and my family is 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.340
 very bulky and this is not for this we 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.380
 my family will like it 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.450
 this has been simple if they felt it 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.450
 them and I'm grateful to you very 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.450
 grateful with the chain 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.420
 but I did not like football today in 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.430
 ahead 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.810
 I left Veracruz because this has 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.920
 to enjoy and already begins to suffer 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:24.650
 again I do not know what my house is and I know 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.090
 I appreciate but but but but I 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.950
 they lacked the respect of disrespect 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.180
 Very strong and from poblano poblano 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.180
 I say and that's how the poblanos are 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:39.600
 probably yes but I have even what 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.730
 that I 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.080
 and many many many many thanks 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.460
 thank you all thank you very much the 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.710
 I went from how to fully populate to see 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:50.660
 more to this day no longer no longer 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.660

00:02:52.250 --> 00:03:01.010

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.740
 Felix I hope you stay and 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.240
 reconsider tonight but happy is a 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:14.490
 man who generally lives on the sidelines 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:16.140
 of the respect that did to me what has 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.940
 taught or has not been reflected through 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.170
 of his coaching career a man 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.970
 of fighting a man of temperament 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.680
 clear although it overcomes the bad 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.330
 moments that recover teams that are 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.190
 on the edge of the descent that most 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:31.980
 competitive does miracles in the 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:34.400
 dressing nothing happens to me nothing happens 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.400
 of happiness 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.180
 good pause and goodbye pause
