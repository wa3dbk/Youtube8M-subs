 absolutely nowhere because before 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.180
 make a review I was looking for at least some 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.190
 information about what kind of game it is 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.340
 what the client is constantly asking me 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.190
 but children have and honestly I did not understand that 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.200

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.920
 any service already finished 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.729
 any map here in the settings you 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.799
 can set 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.049
 there are such bad graphics 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.229
 the best graphics, that is, well, many many 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.920
 another and click the old game if you 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.530
 want there we choose some for example 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:22.380
 we call the card anything and it is created 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.990
 card on reading the essence of this game like me 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.000
 I realized I was not a fan and I just spent 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.400
 we are 20-30 minutes time to 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.560
 understand in general what kind of game it is 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.780
 simple you are given to you 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.509
 card on counting the whole mass is worth paying 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.570
 attention from some cubes that is 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.310
 Essentially, let's choose to this cube and 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.750
 let's click let's say here 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.030
 here's the way you start building 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.340
 in the same way absolutely all is built 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.470
 card absolutely all pay attention yes 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.810
 that here everything consists of cubes 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.149
 squares but also many many other things 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.939
 you need to do this run build 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.549
 I do not know how to mine in color 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:03.210
 swim on land so please click 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:06.090
 pause and I want to see the little man here 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.440
 something like this means searching for mine 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.540
 when I started looking for this game at all 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.610
 what is it which is generally called 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.060
 that where did they even get a lot of 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.980
 another I found this game for 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.570
 stationary computer that is me so 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.820
 I understand that this game is on 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.640
 a stationary computer after which I 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.850
 Liza implemented on ios and in my opinion she 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.670
 there is on android I unfortunately do not know 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:34.100
 the dumbest and completely incomprehensible to 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.000
 me game I've ever met 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.440
 this is if you have not played enough once 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.990
 lego designers this if you don't 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.720
 played out there at all just something 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:47.150
 there on you can not fall here is what is 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.640
 flowers are not clear at all cards absolutely 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.100
 well what can you do yes let's some 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.560
 build a type of house when you can there 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.960
 build walls and you expose that is 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.830
 but completely everything you want there is a door 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.500
 and much more 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.250
 when you for example yes happens so let's 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.510
 now add 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.270
 when you build something that is right there yet 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.110
 need to get 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:13.300

 some houses here well 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.410
 and so on and so here 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.600
 really there can be done 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.300
 interesting things yes people create cool 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.980

 you can create I saw found 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.440
 interesting cool stuff but i don't understand 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.120
 for whom is this game yes that is but 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.910
 absolutely no logic 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.670
 absolutely she's ugly some yes here 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.380
 like water but it's incomprehensible to me just not 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.450
 understandable for whom it is fun komono 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.610
 I need to answer somehow I arrive 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:07.790
 that's not how i did it i even 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:09.860
 don't know so jump 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.969
 I understand that I'm stuck in the general game 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.950
 absolutely idiotic does not mean so we 

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:17.660
 now here we will dig up something 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.180
 excavate the display is located if 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.130
 honestly damn i'm talking about i just can't 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.680
 there is absolutely no intelligence in this game 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.030
 no time kill and incomprehensible 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:30.470
 what do you want to achieve 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:32.479
 so if we go out now I even 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.449
 asked the question yes that is on the internet 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:38.630
 pay attention I asked him what you need 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:41.180
 do in the game minecraft I found 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.530
 several answers and most of all to me 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.590
 liked from mail.ru 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.810
 so push more build different houses 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.300
 figures add different things there fly 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.979
 and build there and so on I am very 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.550
 I liked this and ben answer 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:58.400
 if you are not a schoolboy then you have nothing to do 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.710
 This game is about this 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.259
 the game is real for school kids anymore i'm not 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.479
 I understand who needs people who are 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:07.190
 he plays it just the dumbest really 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:09.380
 the dumbest generally incomprehensible game 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.970
 which today is and yet 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.690
 un worth really big money 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:16.520
 just huge for about 200 rubles 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.800
 there is not even a room for dollars 7 broken 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.860
 worth what 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:24.139
 to build survive blow up mine 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.669
 whales resource kill mobs and not even here 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:28.330
 such me so there someone else runs 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:31.669
 apparently on the topic of two which I 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:34.220
 saw in general the most stupid game that I 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:35.780
 just where I don't understand why 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.669
 you just had to pay money 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.610
 Understand feet lasts a client's desire for 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:41.470
 that's why I was asked the law therefore I am 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.970
 buy 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.770
 schoolchildren go enough enough 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.500
 popularity among schoolchildren therefore 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:51.650
 very many play it and of course 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:54.099
 thanks for the sheets, I understand that at least 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:56.960
 And not the best review one honestly but 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:58.849
 it's a dumb game but nevertheless we have
