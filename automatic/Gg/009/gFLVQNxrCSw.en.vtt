00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.200
 in this first exercise we want that 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.139
 an asterisk appears on those 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.059
 consumptions that exceed the annual average 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.630
 in this case we will do the following 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:18.170
 we do here 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:21.080
 same if we make parentheses 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.200
 if this value here is higher in this 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.680
 case to your average that with option 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:32.320
 command t command we'll fix you we'll do 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:35.690
 semicolon quotes asterisk commas 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.750
 semicolons quotes and quotes 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.950
 we close parentheses we do intro we go 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.950
 to copy this value down 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.190
 now we give you right button we want 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.579
 copy 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.320
 we go here we tell him to hit and we 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.170
 we repeat with this one here right button 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.809
 we say stuck 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.079
 we already have in this exercise those 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:02.930
 months whose consumption is above in 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.720
 this case of your average in the exercise 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.390
 next it was that we wanted that 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.729
 appeared with a plus sign the month with 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.890
 higher consumption and a minus sign with lower 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:17.810
 consumption we will do the following in this 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:21.799
 case we will do the same if I open parentheses if 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.040
 this value here is equal to its maximum 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.000
 that we are going to set 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:30.140
 drinking tea drinking tea 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.850
 we will do for you eat comillas we will put 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:37.100
 the plus point and quotes eat 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:41.180
 we will see again if we open parentheses 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:45.550
 this value here is the same in this case 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:50.170
 At your minimal tecoman command I told you 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:54.110
 we make commas less 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.119
 quotation marks comma quotation marks 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.210
 means that blank the others cic 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.729
 will be blank we close and close 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:05.020
 we do intro and we are going to copy this 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:07.420
 value that shows down 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.629
 we already have higher and lower right button 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.750
 we say copy we go to the next 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:17.470
 right button paste we delete the next 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.540
 right button pasting we already know in each 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.870
 month by consumption which has been greater and 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.870
 less
