00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
will I don't know I mean it's not the

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.249 
will I don't know I mean it's not the
code<00:01:53.790> out<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.060> regulate<00:01:54.450> these<00:01:54.630> things<00:01:54.899> how

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
code out to regulate these things how

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.899 
code out to regulate these things how
one<00:01:55.470> more<00:01:55.619> handles<00:01:55.979> returns<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.670> everything

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
one more handles returns and everything

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.749 
one more handles returns and everything
like<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.119> so<00:01:57.479> i<00:01:58.409> figured<00:01:59.040> if<00:01:59.280> i<00:01:59.490> order<00:01:59.729> it

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
like that so i figured if i order it

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.459 
like that so i figured if i order it
offline<00:02:00.180> i'm<00:02:00.420> not<00:02:00.540> going<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.689> get<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.869> reef<00:02:01.259> for

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
offline i'm not going to get a reef for

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.149 
offline i'm not going to get a reef for
a<00:02:02.659> used<00:02:03.659> one<00:02:03.990> it's<00:02:04.680> going<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:04.860> come<00:02:04.979> straight

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
a used one it's going to come straight

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.619 
a used one it's going to come straight
from<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.820> warehouse<00:02:07.640> because<00:02:08.640> 11<00:02:09.360> like
