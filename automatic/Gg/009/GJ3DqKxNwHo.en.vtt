 this place is your middle finger 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.020
 middle finger washed away so we take 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.020

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.619
 so that the thumb is bent a little 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.729
 that is, not so could they dry in general 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.600
 so as we should hold the bow 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:32.790

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:36.659
 and the exercise is for us here 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.950
 to this point we are old finger these fingers 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:45.440
 we lift up let's start first 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:48.630
 you need to start learning hand 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:51.450
 relaxing first we relax my hand then 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.030
 we need to raise our hand and put 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.659

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.270
 the desired point is needed . again I will show 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.759
 this is the first phalanx and after the first 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.000
 phalanx literally here is the beginning of the second 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:09.950
 phalanxes and this is necessary. well, approximately 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.080
 that is, you can say so. 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.900
 how we will in the future hold 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.810
 the bow is generally what we need 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.080
 learn and do the exercise weaken 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:26.330
 we understand the sleeve and set the tussen to do 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:31.380
 learn five times ten 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:38.700
 when we managed to rule and attention we 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:44.640
 take here from us what are you doing next we 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:48.000
 take a simple pencil and paste 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.730
 a simple pencil between our fingers 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.010
 notice how we do you 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.140
 inserted and about sniper even replace 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:03:01.230
 we have a ball like this 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:03.239
 we will lie bow here we put in 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.920
 simple pencil we hold in place 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.079
 bow 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.310
 simple pencil easier for myself so 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:11.130
 start will be easier 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.910
 correctly put your fingers and so we 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:17.060
 put 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:21.019
 and we try to play like that 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:24.930
 try the way here I play 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:27.590
 well and also we just lay our fingers like 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.590
