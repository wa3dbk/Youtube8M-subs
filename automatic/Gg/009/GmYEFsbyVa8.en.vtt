the Brainiac hairpiece he just looks all
out<00:01:39.390> like<00:01:39.630> Albert<00:01:39.960> Einstein<00:01:39.990> Howard<00:01:40.950> Hughes

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
out like Albert Einstein Howard Hughes

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.219 
out like Albert Einstein Howard Hughes
crazy<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.509> kind<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.840> think<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.110> the

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
crazy and I kind of think that the

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.889 
crazy and I kind of think that the
engineer<00:01:43.740> is<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.950> little<00:01:44.310> crazy<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.780> you'll

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
engineer is a little crazy so and you'll

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.270 
engineer is a little crazy so and you'll
see<00:01:46.079> some<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.350> these<00:01:46.439> classes<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.130> have

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
see some of these classes that I have

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.889 
see some of these classes that I have
like<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.610> set<00:01:47.820> up<00:01:47.970> they're<00:01:48.180> all<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.659> same

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
like the set up they're all the same

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.679 
like the set up they're all the same
because<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.530> only<00:01:49.829> really<00:01:50.250> use<00:01:50.490> one<00:01:50.939> engineer

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
because I only really use one engineer

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.630 
because I only really use one engineer
whenever<00:01:52.049> I'm<00:01:52.200> playing<00:01:52.530> engineer<00:01:53.040> that's

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
whenever I'm playing engineer that's

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.639 
whenever I'm playing engineer that's
because<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:54.000> don't<00:01:54.060> really<00:01:54.450> play<00:01:54.689> engineer<00:01:55.200> so

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
because I don't really play engineer so

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.609 
because I don't really play engineer so
number<00:01:56.549> four<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:57.090> have<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.719> mining<00:01:58.229> light<00:01:58.409> it's

number<00:03:25.750> one<00:03:25.930> hat<00:03:26.260> is<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:26.770> vintage<00:03:27.070> safe<00:03:27.580> and

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
number one hat is the vintage safe and

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.060 
number one hat is the vintage safe and
sound<00:03:28.060> see<00:03:28.810> down<00:03:28.959> here<00:03:29.050> with<00:03:29.320> the<00:03:29.440> three<00:03:29.740> chin

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
and the pip-boy

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.790 
and the pip-boy
I<00:03:31.240> think<00:03:31.810> the<00:03:31.870> statement<00:03:32.080> sound<00:03:32.380> is<00:03:32.500> cool<00:03:32.680> is

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
I think the statement sound is cool is

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.710 
I think the statement sound is cool is
probably<00:03:33.100> one<00:03:33.250> of<00:03:33.280> the<00:03:33.430> first<00:03:33.730> engineer<00:03:34.420> hats

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
probably one of the first engineer hats

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.870 
probably one of the first engineer hats
that<00:03:35.020> I<00:03:35.050> got<00:03:35.470> and<00:03:35.770> at<00:03:36.280> one<00:03:36.430> point<00:03:36.640> I<00:03:36.760> actually

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
that I got and at one point I actually

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.760 
that I got and at one point I actually
had<00:03:37.330> the<00:03:37.570> vintage<00:03:37.930> safe<00:03:38.200> and<00:03:38.380> sounded<00:03:38.680> like

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
had the vintage safe and sounded like

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.410

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
three or four different colors I made

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.630 
three or four different colors I made
some<00:03:40.630> crazy<00:03:41.350> trade<00:03:41.800> and<00:03:42.010> the<00:03:42.070> guy<00:03:42.220> gave<00:03:42.610> me

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640

of all of them except the white one

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.750 
of all of them except the white one
because<00:03:47.380> it<00:03:47.500> reminds<00:03:47.860> me<00:03:48.010> of<00:03:48.130> some<00:03:48.340> big<00:03:48.580> like
