00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.930
 hello how about how are you beat addicts 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.090
 here is once again with all of you 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:21.950
 and today I bring you a gameplay by request 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:24.320
 popular of Formula 1 2011 this game that 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:27.670
 It has me 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.900
 a little bit bitten by the eggs because 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:34.340
 how are you going to be able to see now 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:37.480
 I'm 97% of the trophies and the last 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.480
 trophy that I have left is 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:44.030
 drum roll even if it does not come out 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.160
 that deserves a like I miss eight wins 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.780
 and eight world championships eight 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.150
 world championships that include yes no 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.390
 I'm wrong 18 races each championship 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:56.629
 two minimum turns etc etc we are 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.860
 fucked but fucked fucking in the end like 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.900
 I have to do it for balls 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.480
 I have decided to pay attention to the 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.540
 subscribers and try to see if we get 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.160
 at 40 likes or not and in the case of 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:12.350
 get to the 40 likes then continue with 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:14.869
 is 777 with this not with this saga of 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.899
 videos with this playlist of 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:20.420
 formula 1 2011 as you can see we are 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:23.090
 in australia I think if I'm not wrong and 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.580
 we have started from the back completely 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.440
 there are penalties of any kind because 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.210
 What I want to do is pass it on 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.119
 You're welcome because I've obviously already 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.920
 gone with his penalties and everything with 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.080
 the seen the trophies that there are without 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.670
 helps and I do not know what if I do not know how many and 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.170
 good 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.200
 Now, how do you do it fast? 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.420
 and running to complete it 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.710
 there are 78 times good I will try 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.899
 drive a little better so that what 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.080
 You see, my mother, I'm going to stay here 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:52.310
 I do not know how to drive like I do 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.549
 what to do quickly and running then 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.850
 then I have decided to postpone it without 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:01.549
 penalties and with nothing to finish 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.590
 before with it I also have to 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.049
 say that if you put it with penalties 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.459
 instead of having to do 18 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:12.560
 what you can do is take out the 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:15.260
 enough advantage to for the second 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.660
 pilot of the classification and then 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.610
 Dedicate to fuck other cars and 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.530
 that they penalize you so that they throw you before 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.970
 of the circuit therefore in that way 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.330
 you're going to save about four or five 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.250
 about average careers and it 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.890
 makes a little bit shorter in the 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.500
 championship because good 18 circuits to 3 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:38.810
 turns each one each turn is one 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:41.360
 average of two minutes about two minutes 30 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:45.260
 and three minutes plus or minus three minutes 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:48.470
 and a half and three minutes therefore he 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.930
 to pass the championship eight times is a 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.870
 time not that that time is used in 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.239
 live for example not among other things 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.290
 basically then so what a 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:02.239
 so much is that trophy but good 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.860
 time to time and with patience and 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:07.430
 saliva he got the elephant to the 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.099
 ant that everything is possible 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.489
 finally you see the graphics very cool 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:17.120
 to be a game so old but it's 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.680
 pretty well the ones these the ones 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.390
 pilots the artificial intelligence is 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.190
 pretty pretty pretty tocapelotas 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.500
 there is nothing a touch do not believe that 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.480
 I would leave just when he is saying 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.120
 that is a little bit of tocapelotas hits me the 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.829
 touch and the truth is that it is quite 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.480
 entertaining this game by removing this 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:35.989
 damn trophy that takes away the desire 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.269
 until you buy the 2012 or 13 or 14 or 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.530
 the one that cojones leaves later but good 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:43.290
 removing that all right 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.000
 we have a nitro with in the 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.250
 square if I'm not mistaken is how 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.060
 we take the meter exactly or it is not a 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:53.599
 liter let's say it 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:58.430
 as I tell you in short as the accelerator 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:58.430
 it has just got has he 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:06.070
 the drum, so to speak, not the I do not know 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:08.260
 how to call it the capsule the cylinder what 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.930
 that you want to call vale de Ã³xido 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.580
 nitrous is for all the laps for 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.170
 the three do not recharge it in each round 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.269
 what I wanted to say I'm a 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.970
 little thick and then 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.789
 the rear spoiler can be lifted from 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.819
 once in a while to look is not true sorry 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:27.979
 excuse me criminal shit if you the 

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:30.409
 recharge on each lap worth forgiveness is 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:34.069
 the one of the recharge in each round passes is 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:37.729
 that had a skid there and anyway and what 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:39.770
 What I keep saying is that sometimes you can 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:41.780
 lift the eaves the rear wing in 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.520
 straight is worth that in time trial mode 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.919
 there is a trophy that you have to do 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.650
 the best time of each circuit is 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:50.630
 it is necessary that you put the control without 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.120
 help you make good adjustments to the 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.650
 car especially in the marches that 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.180
 make a setting that goes fast in 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.710
 the curves especially in some in 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.479
 some circuits is the most trophy 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.430
 complicated of the game removing this is 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:04.490
 boring but this is easy is matter 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:07.490
 of time the other is a matter of master 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:10.759
 skills that something else and the spoiler 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.830
 back plays a game or is game 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:15.530
 game is a position where 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.810
 important not so to say in the 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.150
 times that we do apart from nitro and 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.409
 of the good regulation that we do but what 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.280
 I tell you the most important thing is to go without 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:24.560
 helps 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.030
 to help us in braking that nothing 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.310
 I mean do not have help from anything 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.260
 only traced because that's the way 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.820
 way you will be able to see how to draw the 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.100
 curves in the best possible way and not 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.110
 practically losing that time trophy 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.639
 it will cost you to cry 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.800
 even I'm going to pull the hairs 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:41.780
 unless you are very good 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.480
 drivers or good drivers 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.490
 it cost me two circuits the rest 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.590
 all good but I've talked to people who 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.060
 that has not yet achieved it 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.810
 game since February since when it came out 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:55.910
 I mean they shared themselves as good friends 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.470
 this was the first video I've done 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.300
 basically by the requests of the 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.280
 people and I hope you liked it 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.930
 I feel the shit I've had with the 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.480
 nitro but hey it is already clear 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.800
 he recharges it at every turn and good at 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.770
 If you liked it, leave me 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:12.110
 comments obviously you give me likes and 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:14.450
 if we reach 40 likes we continue with 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.490
 all playlists what 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:18.650
 put in favorites and if you are new 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.930
 subscribe if you need help on 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.940
 the trophies of formula-1 you need a 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.530
 guide as you have seen I have all 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.370
 except this last one I can explain to you 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:29.509
 a little above 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:31.880
 except this trophy that is the one that 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:33.650
 I say that I could not tell you exactly 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.270
 the settings they use because they do not 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:38.300
 I remember but if I could give you one 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:40.580
 small guide how you can get it 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.870
 or how you can cost less in order if 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.539
 you need a guide, you do it in the 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:48.590
 comments I'll tell you 40 here 

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:49.970
 we followed 40 likes and we followed and nothing 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.500
 I have to do all circuits if 

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.750
 the thing is fine if we get the 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.430
 enough likes I will make video of each one 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.569
 of them agreed in order then we 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.349
 we see in the following friends 

00:06:56.569 --> 00:06:59.349
 a greeting chao chao
