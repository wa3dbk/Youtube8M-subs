about<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:39.870> gun<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.079> its<00:00:40.290> iron<00:00:40.500> sights<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.070> if

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
about this gun is its iron sights and if

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.709 
about this gun is its iron sights and if
you<00:00:41.370> played<00:00:41.550> modern<00:00:41.730> warfare<00:00:41.969> 2<00:00:42.390> you'll

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
you played modern warfare 2 you'll

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.869 
you played modern warfare 2 you'll
notice<00:00:42.989> there's<00:00:43.170> somewhat<00:00:43.440> similar<00:00:43.879> though

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
notice there's somewhat similar though

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.369 
notice there's somewhat similar though
there<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.180> difference<00:00:45.570> they<00:00:45.840> have<00:00:46.050> made<00:00:46.230> the

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
there is a difference they have made the

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.229 
there is a difference they have made the
circle<00:00:46.739> as<00:00:46.920> well<00:00:47.129> as<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.370> three<00:00:47.579> prongs<00:00:47.879> wider

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
circle as well as the three prongs wider

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.180 
circle as well as the three prongs wider
which<00:00:49.140> actually<00:00:49.320> makes<00:00:49.559> them<00:00:49.710> usable<00:00:49.950> in<00:00:50.100> this

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
which actually makes them usable in this

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.250 
which actually makes them usable in this
game<00:00:50.370> though<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.120> still<00:00:51.719> can't<00:00:51.930> really<00:00:52.079> figure

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
game though I still can't really figure

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.990 
game though I still can't really figure
it<00:00:52.469> out<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.890> still<00:00:53.340> can't<00:00:53.370> figure<00:00:53.730> out<00:00:53.820> that

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
it out I still can't figure out that

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.470 
it out I still can't figure out that
perfect<00:00:54.329> sweet<00:00:54.510> spot<00:00:54.949> they<00:00:55.949> are<00:00:56.070> usable<00:00:56.489> which

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
perfect sweet spot they are usable which

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.119 
perfect sweet spot they are usable which
allows<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.199> use<00:00:58.379> other<00:00:58.559> attachments

work with an acog site but I personally
dislike<00:01:29.340> this<00:01:29.759> site<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.299> find<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:31.140> it's<00:01:31.320> very

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
dislike this site I find that it's very

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.219 
dislike this site I find that it's very
very<00:01:32.280> clunky<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.820> takes<00:01:33.659> longer<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:33.960> aim<00:01:34.079> down

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
very clunky it takes longer to aim down

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.410 
very clunky it takes longer to aim down
the<00:01:34.290> site<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:35.400> just<00:01:35.610> it's<00:01:35.759> hard<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:36.150> look

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
the site and it just it's hard to look

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.670 
the site and it just it's hard to look
through<00:01:36.659> there's<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.079> good<00:01:37.200> glare<00:01:37.500> or

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
through there's a good glare or

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.890 
through there's a good glare or
something<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.240> I'd<00:01:39.240> rather<00:01:39.450> just<00:01:39.689> use

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
something that I'd rather just use

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.700 
something that I'd rather just use
something<00:01:40.200> like<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:41.240> reflex<00:01:42.380> since<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.530> reflex

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
something like a reflex since the reflex

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.940 
something like a reflex since the reflex
has<00:01:44.250> more<00:01:44.729> zoomed<00:01:45.000> in<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.270> red<00:01:45.420> dot<00:01:45.950> the

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
has more zoomed in the red dot the

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.580 
has more zoomed in the red dot the
infrared<00:01:47.520> scope<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:48.170> completely<00:01:49.170> unusable

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
infrared scope is completely unusable

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.679 
infrared scope is completely unusable
because<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.670> think<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:50.909> scope<00:01:51.329> is<00:01:51.479> just

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
because I think that scope is just

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.999 
because I think that scope is just
terrible<00:01:52.560> on<00:01:52.890> any<00:01:53.130> gun<00:01:53.340> in<00:01:53.430> this<00:01:53.520> game<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:55.009> the

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
terrible on any gun in this game and the

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.760 
terrible on any gun in this game and the
suppressor<00:01:56.640> though<00:01:57.570> it's<00:01:57.899> not<00:01:58.110> bad<00:01:58.469> with<00:01:58.680> the

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
suppressor though it's not bad with the

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.530 
suppressor though it's not bad with the
suppressor<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.460> wouldn't<00:01:59.969> recommend<00:02:00.270> it

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
suppressor I wouldn't recommend it

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.350 
suppressor I wouldn't recommend it
because<00:02:01.409> up<00:02:02.399> close<00:02:02.670> this<00:02:02.880> gun<00:02:03.060> can<00:02:03.240> be<00:02:03.329> a

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
because up close this gun can be a

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.840 
because up close this gun can be a
two-shot<00:02:03.840> kill<00:02:04.110> however<00:02:05.009> by<00:02:05.430> using<00:02:05.640> the

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
two-shot kill however by using the

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.340 
two-shot kill however by using the
suppressor<00:02:06.329> you'll<00:02:06.570> make<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:06.869> three<00:02:07.110> shots

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
suppressor you'll make it three shots

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.859 
suppressor you'll make it three shots
and<00:02:07.649> with<00:02:08.099> a<00:02:08.129> semi-automatic<00:02:08.429> rifle<00:02:09.239> three

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
and with a semi-automatic rifle three

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.930 
and with a semi-automatic rifle three
shots<00:02:10.170> just<00:02:10.379> made<00:02:10.530> be<00:02:10.860> one<00:02:11.550> too<00:02:11.760> many

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.070 

my<00:02:14.940> favorite<00:02:15.300> attachment<00:02:15.660> for<00:02:15.780> this<00:02:15.870> gun

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
my favorite attachment for this gun

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.930 
my favorite attachment for this gun
besides<00:02:16.620> of<00:02:16.800> red<00:02:16.950> dot<00:02:17.130> or<00:02:17.280> reflex<00:02:17.670> would<00:02:17.850> be

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
besides of red dot or reflex would be

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.700 
besides of red dot or reflex would be
the<00:02:18.030> master<00:02:18.360> key<00:02:18.480> like<00:02:18.690> I<00:02:18.810> said<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.440> the

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
the master key like I said and the

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.160 
the master key like I said and the
reason<00:02:20.010> why<00:02:20.130> is<00:02:20.160> because<00:02:20.280> this<00:02:20.760> gun<00:02:20.970> isn't<00:02:21.810> too

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
reason why is because this gun isn't too

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.320 
reason why is because this gun isn't too
great<00:02:22.350> up<00:02:22.620> close<00:02:22.770> in<00:02:23.330> close-quarter

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
great up close in close-quarter

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.320 
great up close in close-quarter
situations<00:02:24.900> you'll<00:02:25.050> most<00:02:25.260> likely<00:02:25.350> lose<00:02:25.800> and

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
situations you'll most likely lose and

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.640 
situations you'll most likely lose and
with<00:02:27.330> a<00:02:27.360> master<00:02:27.780> key<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:28.020> can<00:02:28.080> easily<00:02:28.470> switch

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
with a master key you can easily switch

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.740 
with a master key you can easily switch
to<00:02:28.950> your<00:02:29.070> shotgun<00:02:29.550> and<00:02:29.760> win<00:02:30.270> a<00:02:30.300> lot<00:02:30.540> more<00:02:30.720> of

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
to your shotgun and win a lot more of

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.610 
to your shotgun and win a lot more of
these<00:02:30.930> gunfights<00:02:32.570> so<00:02:33.570> if<00:02:33.930> your<00:02:34.170> art<00:02:34.350> with

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
these gunfights so if your art with

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.710 
these gunfights so if your art with
using<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:34.890> irons<00:02:35.340> then<00:02:36.180> I<00:02:36.210> highly<00:02:36.600> suggest

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
using the irons then I highly suggest

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.100 
using the irons then I highly suggest
using<00:02:37.020> the<00:02:37.230> master<00:02:37.560> key<00:02:37.710> arm<00:02:38.000> I<00:02:39.000> think<00:02:39.930> you<00:02:40.020> can

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
using the master key arm I think you can

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.510 
using the master key arm I think you can
get<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.320> flamethrower<00:02:40.800> on<00:02:40.920> this<00:02:41.130> gun<00:02:41.310> too

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
get the flamethrower on this gun too

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.240 
get the flamethrower on this gun too
though<00:02:42.240> I<00:02:42.660> didn't<00:02:42.990> try<00:02:43.200> it<00:02:43.230> out<00:02:43.500> because<00:02:44.010> I

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
though I didn't try it out because I

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.620 
though I didn't try it out because I
don't<00:02:44.430> believe<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.760> flamethrowers<00:02:45.300> all<00:02:45.450> that

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
don't believe the flamethrowers all that

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.380 
don't believe the flamethrowers all that
great<00:02:45.870> but<00:02:46.370> if<00:02:47.370> you<00:02:47.400> prefer<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.970> flamethrower

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
great but if you prefer the flamethrower

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.070 
great but if you prefer the flamethrower
over<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.870> mast<00:02:49.050> key<00:02:49.350> shotgun<00:02:49.800> then<00:02:50.930> you<00:02:51.930> can

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
over the mast key shotgun then you can

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.260 
over the mast key shotgun then you can
also<00:02:52.200> use<00:02:52.320> that<00:02:54.020> so<00:02:55.020> perks<00:02:55.530> with<00:02:55.860> this<00:02:55.980> gun<00:02:56.270> for

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
also use that so perks with this gun for
