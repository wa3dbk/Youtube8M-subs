00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
year on ultimate team and I figured that

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.120 
year on ultimate team and I figured that
I<00:01:23.670> would<00:01:23.759> start<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.270> off<00:01:24.360> in<00:01:24.600> this<00:01:24.810> series<00:01:25.710> to

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
I would start it off in this series to

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.249 
I would start it off in this series to
get<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.670> get<00:01:26.850> my<00:01:27.000> solar-powered<00:01:27.390> squad<00:01:27.930> going

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.469 
get to get my solar-powered squad going
and<00:01:28.439> so<00:01:29.009> basically<00:01:29.280> once<00:01:29.790> it's<00:01:30.030> all<00:01:30.180> said<00:01:30.210> and

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
and so basically once it's all said and

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.240 
and so basically once it's all said and
done<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.780> it's<00:01:31.020> all<00:01:31.170> been<00:01:31.350> built<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.950> looks

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
done and it's all been built it looks

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.830 
done and it's all been built it looks
like<00:01:32.430> this<00:01:32.549> basically<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.150> silver<00:01:33.479> guy<00:01:33.630> as

see<00:03:57.989> all<00:03:58.109> the<00:03:58.200> other<00:03:58.230> chances<00:03:58.769> where<00:03:58.950> he<00:03:59.040> does

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
see all the other chances where he does

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.740 
see all the other chances where he does
sort<00:03:59.489> of<00:03:59.549> skill<00:03:59.819> moves<00:04:00.060> and<00:04:00.299> stuff<00:04:00.390> and
