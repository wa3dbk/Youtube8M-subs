00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
it's not got quite the same presence as

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:40.900 
it's not got quite the same presence as
the<00:00:38.750> aprilia<00:00:39.230> shiver<00:00:39.290> when<00:00:39.710> you<00:00:39.800> start<00:00:40.040> it<00:00:40.219> but

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
the aprilia shiver when you start it but

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:47.860 
the aprilia shiver when you start it but
uh<00:00:40.940> yeah<00:00:41.600> it's<00:00:41.719> a<00:00:41.780> little<00:00:42.079> go<00:00:42.199> on<00:00:42.350> this

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.490

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
speaks perfectly for me it's better than

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.880 
speaks perfectly for me it's better than
my<00:01:04.580> bike<00:01:04.879> the<00:01:05.089> leg<00:01:05.239> wise<00:01:05.509> but<00:01:05.840> mine<00:01:06.020> hasn't<00:01:06.800> got

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
my bike the leg wise but mine hasn't got

my bike the leg wise but mine hasn't got
quite<00:01:07.220> the<00:01:07.250> same<00:01:07.700> curvature<00:01:08.950> where<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:10.070> legs

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
quite the same curvature where the legs

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.010 
quite the same curvature where the legs
go<00:01:10.490> it's<00:01:10.940> just<00:01:11.000> never<00:01:11.270> gonna<00:01:11.390> be<00:01:11.509> a<00:01:11.630> good<00:01:11.780> fit

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
go it's just never gonna be a good fit

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.510 
go it's just never gonna be a good fit
but<00:01:12.770> uh<00:01:12.830> scoot<00:01:13.610> some<00:01:13.790> beans<00:01:13.970> 5k<00:01:14.390> rows<00:01:15.399> that<00:01:16.399> way

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
but uh scoot some beans 5k rows that way

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.480 
but uh scoot some beans 5k rows that way
up<00:01:16.640> to<00:01:16.790> 11<00:01:17.180> K<00:01:17.390> roads<00:01:17.659> it's<00:01:18.560> not<00:01:18.770> a<00:01:18.799> bad<00:01:19.130> bike

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
up to 11 K roads it's not a bad bike

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.850 
up to 11 K roads it's not a bad bike
it's<00:01:20.210> good<00:01:20.690> I<00:01:20.929> like<00:01:21.410> it

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
it's good I like it

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.609 
it's good I like it
all<00:01:22.820> right<00:01:23.060> that's<00:01:23.420> a<00:01:23.600> problem<00:01:23.990> as<00:01:24.170> you<00:01:24.440> might

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
all right that's a problem as you might

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.320 
all right that's a problem as you might
have<00:01:24.740> just<00:01:24.800> seen<00:01:25.070> then<00:01:25.280> that<00:01:25.550> the<00:01:25.729> throttle<00:01:26.090> it

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
have just seen then that the throttle it

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.540 
have just seen then that the throttle it
really<00:01:26.810> are<00:01:26.899> no<00:01:27.080> one<00:01:27.259> single<00:01:28.130> sending<00:01:28.490> the

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
really are no one single sending the

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.180 
really are no one single sending the
bikes<00:01:28.789> and<00:01:29.119> generally<00:01:29.780> one<00:01:29.929> to<00:01:30.110> five<00:01:30.350> the

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
bikes and generally one to five the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.040 
bikes and generally one to five the
front<00:01:31.460> ways<00:01:31.580> either<00:01:31.789> on<00:01:32.090> or<00:01:32.119> off<00:01:32.450> at<00:01:32.690> that<00:01:32.840> low

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
front ways either on or off at that low

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.430 
front ways either on or off at that low
res<00:01:33.320> but<00:01:33.979> he's<00:01:34.159> just<00:01:34.369> takes<00:01:34.580> the<00:01:34.700> piss<00:01:35.140> my<00:01:36.140> bike

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
res but he's just takes the piss my bike

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.279 
res but he's just takes the piss my bike
at<00:01:36.920> low<00:01:37.159> revs<00:01:37.399> you<00:01:37.700> can<00:01:37.909> kind<00:01:38.360> of<00:01:38.630> go<00:01:39.050> all<00:01:39.170> the

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
at low revs you can kind of go all the

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:41.290 
at low revs you can kind of go all the
way<00:01:39.319> down<00:01:39.679> it's<00:01:40.039> not<00:01:40.250> quite<00:01:40.640> as<00:01:40.880> on<00:01:41.000> it's<00:01:41.240> not

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
way down it's not quite as on it's not

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.809 
way down it's not quite as on it's not
quite<00:01:41.539> snap<00:01:41.780> to<00:01:41.899> resist<00:01:42.170> look<00:01:42.429> slowly<00:01:43.429> really

00:01:43.809 --> 00:01:43.819 
quite snap to resist look slowly really

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:46.029 
quite snap to resist look slowly really
let<00:01:44.000> out<00:01:44.149> that<00:01:44.179> slowly<00:01:45.170> let<00:01:45.470> it<00:01:45.590> out<00:01:45.679> and<00:01:45.920> then

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039 
let out that slowly let it out and then

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.779 
let out that slowly let it out and then
it's<00:01:46.250> just<00:01:46.369> gone

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
it's just gone

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:49.450 
it's just gone
the<00:01:46.909> power<00:01:47.090> just<00:01:47.330> goes<00:01:47.530> so<00:01:48.530> that<00:01:48.740> is<00:01:48.920> a<00:01:49.159> little

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
the power just goes so that is a little

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.010 
the power just goes so that is a little
problem<00:01:49.819> while<00:01:50.000> I<00:01:50.240> have<00:01:50.509> there<00:01:50.630> in<00:01:50.720> this<00:01:50.780> bike

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
problem while I have there in this bike

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.469 
problem while I have there in this bike
but<00:01:51.830> I<00:01:51.860> mean<00:01:52.280> apart<00:01:52.580> from<00:01:52.670> that<00:01:52.940> I<00:01:53.119> can't<00:01:53.360> think

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
but I mean apart from that I can't think

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:54.760 
but I mean apart from that I can't think
of<00:01:53.599> anything<00:01:53.780> wrong<00:01:54.050> with<00:01:54.200> this<00:01:54.289> bike<00:01:54.530> I<00:01:54.619> mean

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
of anything wrong with this bike I mean

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
dash is nice of the mind there's more

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.440 
dash is nice of the mind there's more
