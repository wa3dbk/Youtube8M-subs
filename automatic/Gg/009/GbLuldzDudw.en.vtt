00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.509 
let me just talk just briefly about toys
because<00:00:10.139> I<00:00:10.200> think<00:00:10.410> if<00:00:10.650> there's<00:00:10.889> one<00:00:10.950> thing

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
because I think if there's one thing

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.379 
because I think if there's one thing
that<00:00:12.230> gets<00:00:13.230> parents<00:00:13.740> thinking<00:00:14.389> these

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
that gets parents thinking these

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.300 
that gets parents thinking these
differences<00:00:16.080> are<00:00:16.230> hardwired<00:00:16.770> it's<00:00:17.010> when<00:00:17.190> you

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.500 
differences are hardwired it's when you
you<00:00:17.609> see<00:00:18.770> the<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:20.039> different<00:00:20.400> things<00:00:21.330> they

at 1 year of age interesting what you'll
see<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.090> both<00:01:09.869> boys<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.229> girls<00:01:10.470> like

see is that both boys and girls like

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.149 
see is that both boys and girls like
dolls<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:12.270> remember<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.200> said<00:01:13.290> all<00:01:13.650> children

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
dolls so remember I said all children

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.090 
dolls so remember I said all children
are<00:01:14.250> instinctively<00:01:15.320> attracted<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.470> faces<00:01:16.920> and

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
are instinctively attracted to faces and

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.429 
are instinctively attracted to faces and
voices<00:01:17.220> we<00:01:17.610> are<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.790> very<00:01:18.090> social<00:01:18.689> species<00:01:18.930> male

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
voices we are a very social species male

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.679 
voices we are a very social species male
and<00:01:19.740> female<00:01:20.100> kind<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.549> make<00:01:20.700> sense<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.210> we

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
and female kind of make sense that we

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.679 
and female kind of make sense that we
would<00:01:21.810> be<00:01:21.990> aware<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.380> each<00:01:22.500> other<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:22.920> so

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
would be aware of each other and so

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.719 
would be aware of each other and so
dolls<00:01:24.689> have<00:01:24.960> faces<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.650> baby<00:01:26.040> boys<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.580> baby

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
dolls have faces and baby boys and baby

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.200 
dolls have faces and baby boys and baby
girls<00:01:27.030> like<00:01:27.270> dolls<00:01:27.540> but<00:01:28.320> by<00:01:28.530> by<00:01:29.009> 3<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.610> that

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
girls like dolls but by by 3 that that

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.600 
girls like dolls but by by 3 that that
switches<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:31.740> think<00:01:32.070> part<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.579> reason

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
switches and I think part of the reason

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.690 
switches and I think part of the reason
has<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.150> do<00:01:33.390> with<00:01:33.509> gender<00:01:33.869> identification<00:01:34.700> so

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
has to do with gender identification so

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.230 
has to do with gender identification so
beginning<00:01:36.090> about<00:01:36.390> age<00:01:36.630> two<00:01:37.970> children<00:01:38.970> figure

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
beginning about age two children figure

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.149 
beginning about age two children figure
out<00:01:39.390> if<00:01:39.630> they're<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.869> boy<00:01:40.110> or<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.350> girl<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.740> once

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
out if they're a boy or a girl and once

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.819 
out if they're a boy or a girl and once
you<00:01:41.310> figure<00:01:41.610> out<00:01:41.640> if<00:01:41.880> you're<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.030> boy<00:01:42.180> or<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.360> girl

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
you figure out if you're a boy or a girl

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:45.020 
you figure out if you're a boy or a girl
there's<00:01:43.829> so<00:01:43.979> much<00:01:44.100> reinforcement<00:01:44.820> in<00:01:44.909> our

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
there's so much reinforcement in our

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.880 
there's so much reinforcement in our
society<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.659> being<00:01:45.899> like<00:01:46.110> Daddy<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.680> being

usually<00:02:11.580> some<00:02:12.060> form<00:02:12.360> of<00:02:12.810> react

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
usually some form of react

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.339 
usually some form of react
that<00:02:13.739> the<00:02:13.980> child<00:02:14.250> can<00:02:14.489> pick<00:02:14.670> up<00:02:14.879> on<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.420> in

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
that the child can pick up on and in

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.349 
that the child can pick up on and in
fact<00:02:16.650> when<00:02:16.860> you<00:02:16.890> do<00:02:17.099> meta-analysis<00:02:18.030> of<00:02:18.120> a<00:02:18.180> lot

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:18.359 
fact when you do meta-analysis of a lot

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:20.479 
fact when you do meta-analysis of a lot
of<00:02:18.480> studies<00:02:18.750> this<00:02:18.900> is<00:02:19.049> the<00:02:19.170> one<00:02:19.349> way<00:02:19.590> we<00:02:20.340> are

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
of studies this is the one way we are

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.589 
of studies this is the one way we are
less<00:02:21.290> egalitarian<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:22.640> so<00:02:23.640> kids<00:02:24.120> pick<00:02:24.359> up<00:02:24.450> on

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
less egalitarian and so kids pick up on

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.170 
less egalitarian and so kids pick up on
that<00:02:24.780> message<00:02:25.019> and<00:02:25.469> by<00:02:25.709> age<00:02:25.950> five<00:02:26.370> remember<00:02:27.030> I

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
that message and by age five remember I

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.089 
that message and by age five remember I
said<00:02:27.390> that<00:02:27.420> this<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:28.170> difference<00:02:28.500> in<00:02:28.650> choice

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
said that this the difference in choice

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.509 
said that this the difference in choice
which<00:02:29.849> is<00:02:29.879> by<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.569> way<00:02:30.920> orders<00:02:31.920> of<00:02:32.040> magnitude

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
which is by the way orders of magnitude

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.640 
which is by the way orders of magnitude
about<00:02:33.390> an<00:02:33.510> order<00:02:33.720> of<00:02:33.750> magnitude<00:02:33.870> larger<00:02:34.379> than

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
about an order of magnitude larger than

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.259 
about an order of magnitude larger than
the<00:02:34.890> difference<00:02:35.159> in<00:02:35.280> verbal<00:02:35.640> skills<00:02:35.849> and<00:02:36.120> math

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
the difference in verbal skills and math

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:37.130 
the difference in verbal skills and math
skills<00:02:36.540> and<00:02:36.750> so<00:02:36.930> on

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
skills and so on

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.349 
skills and so on
toy<00:02:37.260> choices<00:02:37.829> is<00:02:38.040> really<00:02:38.640> a<00:02:38.670> pronounced<00:02:39.060> sex

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:39.359 
toy choices is really a pronounced sex

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:44.780 
toy choices is really a pronounced sex
difference<00:02:39.720> but<00:02:40.530> by<00:02:40.709> age<00:02:40.920> five<00:02:43.489> what<00:02:44.489> you<00:02:44.579> see

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
difference but by age five what you see

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.369 
difference but by age five what you see
is<00:02:44.909> that<00:02:45.120> girls<00:02:45.510> are<00:02:45.689> splitting<00:02:46.170> their<00:02:46.349> time

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
is that girls are splitting their time

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.170 
is that girls are splitting their time
five-year-old<00:02:47.220> girls<00:02:47.519> in<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:47.790> room<00:02:47.970> full<00:02:48.120> of

toys split their time between the boys

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.819 
toys split their time between the boys
stuff<00:02:50.819> and<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.060> girl<00:02:51.239> stuff<00:02:51.829> five-year-old

boys don't touch the girl stuff they'll
spend<00:02:55.319> maybe<00:02:55.560> ten<00:02:55.859> percent<00:02:56.040> of<00:02:56.340> their<00:02:56.519> time

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
spend maybe ten percent of their time

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.659 
spend maybe ten percent of their time
with<00:02:57.180> that<00:02:57.419> so<00:02:58.139> the<00:02:58.290> girls<00:02:58.590> have<00:02:58.829> learned<00:02:59.129> that

00:02:59.659 --> 00:02:59.669 
with that so the girls have learned that

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:02.509 
with that so the girls have learned that
it's<00:02:59.819> okay<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.739> play<00:03:01.739> with<00:03:01.889> either<00:03:02.099> thing<00:03:02.400> but
