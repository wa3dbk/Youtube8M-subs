00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:14.230
 hi guys i said about a new video 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:16.599
 in which we say it is never successful 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.320
 there is a problem we say is mine 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:20.349
 computer 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:26.560
 this year the laptop will not start that 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:29.289
 see here does not start and I wanted together 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:35.320
 to illustrated some a method 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:38.170
 particular that allows you to treat it 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.500
 his problem is indeed received at 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:44.409
 world for this that helps you to blow 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.199
 your task to start our for 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:52.420
 your computer then to the system neither 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:54.430
 problem then so I recommend you 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:59.019
 try this before sending yours 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:01.809
 as in assistance because in assistance 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.160
 they do this to me 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.899
 also to pay hard on mantles but the work 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:10.420
 when it's a very real car thing 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:13.210
 in short, the first thing to do is remove 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:18.750
 computer battery 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.750
 here is like seeing the extract ok 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.550
 12 people press this especially a 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.500
 who swears that my case is this 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:34.610
 because it can go mythical according to us 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:37.610
 we are ok for 50 seconds then 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.610
 Street 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.280
 expect 50 seconds 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.250
 20 seconds left 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:32.209
 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 we do not release well 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:36.140
 after that we leave the computer alone 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.140
 for 10 minutes 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:44.040
 well it was his ten minute show 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.040
 let's go back to the battery 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.370
 means typical first ten minutes 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.430
 does the salesman left without battery 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:03:01.330
 without power in the vault and therefore 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:03.780
 periphery a battery and then I say it 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.780
 step 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.730
 let's try to start our notebook 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.810
 we press ignition in this 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:19.810
 seems to be starting 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:29.860
 here the boys do this operation 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:34.840
 then so you have to try to do 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:39.010
 this operation several times and for example 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.230
 four or five times also and marian 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.060
 worst in one day after another plus 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.900
 times a day 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:51.760
 yes I put myself not exaggerated and if not 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:53.920
 you are right then sorry port 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.610

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:00.600
