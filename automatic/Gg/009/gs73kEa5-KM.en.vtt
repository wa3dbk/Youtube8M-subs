study it figure out how they work then I

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.229 
study it figure out how they work then I
can<00:00:59.710> apply<00:00:59.829> those<00:01:00.280> things<00:01:00.579> to<00:01:00.910> my<00:01:01.059> own

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
can apply those things to my own

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.680 
can apply those things to my own
