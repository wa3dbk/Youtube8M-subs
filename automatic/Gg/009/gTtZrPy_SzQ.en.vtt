00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
arsenic detector what a bacterial cell

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.920 
arsenic detector what a bacterial cell
that<00:00:35.370> could<00:00:35.550> tell<00:00:35.790> us<00:00:35.969> when<00:00:36.180> arsenic<00:00:36.750> is

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
that could tell us when arsenic is

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.319 
that could tell us when arsenic is
present<00:00:36.960> in<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.590> water<00:00:37.739> see<00:00:38.460> arsenic

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
present in the water see arsenic

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
with the culture of bacteria and know

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.410 
with the culture of bacteria and know
that<00:01:13.860> there's<00:01:14.040> arsenic<00:01:14.549> contamination<00:01:15.119> if

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
that there's arsenic contamination if

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.170 
that there's arsenic contamination if
the<00:01:15.720> liquid<00:01:15.930> changes<00:01:16.229> color<00:01:16.680> awesome<00:01:17.490> but<00:01:18.030> how

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
the liquid changes color awesome but how

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.179 
the liquid changes color awesome but how
did<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.479> get<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.840> bacteria<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.530> do<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.920> I'm

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
did you get a bacteria to do that I'm

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.440 
did you get a bacteria to do that I'm
still<00:01:20.460> trying<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.729> figure<00:01:20.880> out<00:01:21.090> how<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.299> make

let's<00:01:26.729> take<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:26.970> look<00:01:27.270> we<00:01:27.930> knew<00:01:28.170> we<00:01:28.380> needed<00:01:28.530> to

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
let's take a look we knew we needed to

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.530 
let's take a look we knew we needed to
build<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.159> system<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.820> could<00:01:29.970> take<00:01:30.180> as<00:01:30.360> input

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
build a system that could take as input

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.899 
build a system that could take as input
arsenic<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.439> produce<00:01:31.920> as<00:01:32.070> output<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.640> change

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
arsenic and produce as output a change

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.359 
arsenic and produce as output a change
in<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.150> color<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.900> first<00:01:34.259> we<00:01:34.799> compiled<00:01:35.220> our

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
in the color so first we compiled our

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.300 
in the color so first we compiled our
system<00:01:35.850> into<00:01:36.299> devices<00:01:36.600> we<00:01:37.320> needed<00:01:37.650> one<00:01:37.920> device

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
system into devices we needed one device

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.999 
system into devices we needed one device
that<00:01:38.909> could<00:01:39.090> detect<00:01:39.479> arsenic<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.380> produce<00:01:40.829> a

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
that could detect arsenic and produce a

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.609 
that could detect arsenic and produce a
signal<00:01:41.400> we<00:01:41.820> call<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.299> our<00:01:42.509> arsenic<00:01:43.200> sensor

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
signal we call this our arsenic sensor

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.880 
signal we call this our arsenic sensor
and<00:01:43.829> gave<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.670> part<00:01:44.909> number<00:01:45.320> BBA<00:01:47.180> j33<00:01:48.890> 2:01

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
and gave it a part number BBA j33 2:01

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.580 
and gave it a part number BBA j33 2:01
and<00:01:50.159> we<00:01:50.790> needed<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.149> second<00:01:51.570> device<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:52.439> could

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
and we needed a second device that could

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.560 
and we needed a second device that could
produce<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:53.159> color<00:01:53.399> when<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:53.939> get<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.329> signal

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
produce a color when you get the signal

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.719 
produce a color when you get the signal
from<00:01:54.750> our<00:01:55.110> arsenic<00:01:55.649> sensor<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.430> there's

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
from our arsenic sensor that there's

are<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:04.829> using<00:02:05.100> two<00:02:05.430> devices<00:02:05.729> wouldn't<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.450> be

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
are you using two devices wouldn't it be

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.660 
are you using two devices wouldn't it be
easier<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:06.990> make<00:02:07.200> just<00:02:07.380> one<00:02:07.439> arsenic<00:02:08.190> in<00:02:08.399> and

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
easier to make just one arsenic in and

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.880 
easier to make just one arsenic in and
color<00:02:08.879> out<00:02:09.149> well<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:10.170> could<00:02:10.349> do<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:10.830> way

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
color out well you could do it that way

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.339 
color out well you could do it that way
but<00:02:11.849> then<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.239> only<00:02:12.390> thing<00:02:12.750> that<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.050> device

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
or the other for new projects how well a

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.850 
or the other for new projects how well a
team<00:02:27.180> could<00:02:27.450> connect<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:27.930> arsenic<00:02:28.500> sensor

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
team could connect the arsenic sensor

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.680 
team could connect the arsenic sensor
device<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.519> a<00:02:29.550> different<00:02:29.970> reporter<00:02:30.360> device

that se produces light instead of color
or<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.720> team<00:02:34.110> could<00:02:34.349> build<00:02:34.590> a<00:02:34.739> new<00:02:34.769> system<00:02:35.340> that

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
or a team could build a new system that

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.479 
or a team could build a new system that
detects<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.269> mercury<00:02:36.900> contamination<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:37.860> then

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
detects a mercury contamination and then

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.479 
detects a mercury contamination and then
produces<00:02:39.000> a<00:02:39.030> color<00:02:39.360> as<00:02:39.630> a<00:02:39.690> response<00:02:40.260> yep<00:02:40.830> we

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
produces a color as a response yep we

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.490 
produces a color as a response yep we
design<00:02:41.880> our<00:02:41.910> system<00:02:42.450> so<00:02:42.720> that<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.989> people<00:02:43.019> can

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
design our system so that the people can

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.680 
design our system so that the people can
more<00:02:43.709> easily<00:02:43.860> reuse<00:02:44.549> and<00:02:44.760> build<00:02:45.090> on<00:02:45.299> our<00:02:45.390> work

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
more easily reuse and build on our work

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.720 
more easily reuse and build on our work
oh<00:02:46.220> I<00:02:47.220> get<00:02:47.549> it

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
oh I get it

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.430 
oh I get it
maybe<00:02:48.239> I<00:02:48.330> could<00:02:48.540> connect<00:02:48.840> your<00:02:48.989> arsenic

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
maybe I could connect your arsenic

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.900 
maybe I could connect your arsenic
sensor<00:02:49.769> device<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.220> my<00:02:50.310> balloon<00:02:50.610> making

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.470 
sensor device to my balloon making
device<00:02:52.010> exactly<00:02:53.010> but<00:02:53.790> shouldn't<00:02:54.060> I<00:02:54.209> know<00:02:54.269> a

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
device exactly but shouldn't I know a

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.180 
device exactly but shouldn't I know a
little<00:02:54.750> more<00:02:54.959> about<00:02:55.019> how<00:02:55.319> the<00:02:55.380> arsenic<00:02:55.860> sensor

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
little more about how the arsenic sensor

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.130 
little more about how the arsenic sensor
works<00:02:56.489> before<00:02:57.090> I<00:02:57.120> just<00:02:57.510> hook<00:02:57.690> it<00:02:57.780> up<00:02:57.900> to<00:02:58.049> the

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
works before I just hook it up to the

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.449 
works before I just hook it up to the
balloon<00:02:58.410> making<00:02:58.620> device<00:03:00.470> last<00:03:01.470> time<00:03:01.769> I<00:03:02.010> didn't

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
balloon making device last time I didn't

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:03.770 
balloon making device last time I didn't
stop<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.790> balloons<00:03:03.030> from<00:03:03.209> growing<00:03:03.630> and

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
stop the balloons from growing and

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.710 
stop the balloons from growing and
growing<00:03:04.069> that's<00:03:05.069> why<00:03:05.400> we<00:03:05.730> enter<00:03:06.030> both<00:03:06.329> devices

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
growing that's why we enter both devices

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.199 
growing that's why we enter both devices
into<00:03:07.319> the<00:03:07.349> registry<00:03:07.950> of<00:03:07.980> standard<00:03:08.489> biological

online at the I gene wiki the goal is

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.400 
online at the I gene wiki the goal is
that<00:03:14.430> eventually<00:03:14.700> for<00:03:15.390> each<00:03:15.599> part<00:03:15.989> and<00:03:16.110> device

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
that eventually for each part and device

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.020 
that eventually for each part and device
in<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.709> registry<00:03:17.280> there<00:03:17.730> will<00:03:17.880> be<00:03:17.910> a

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
in the registry there will be a

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.759 
in the registry there will be a
datasheet<00:03:18.480> that<00:03:18.840> summarizes<00:03:19.350> all<00:03:19.709> the

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
relevant information about a device so

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.110 
relevant information about a device so
that<00:03:22.590> you<00:03:22.829> know<00:03:23.010> how<00:03:23.160> to<00:03:23.220> use<00:03:23.519> it<00:03:23.700> in<00:03:23.850> a<00:03:23.940> higher

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
that you know how to use it in a higher

yep<00:03:31.590> but<00:03:31.950> I'm<00:03:32.069> afraid<00:03:32.190> there's<00:03:32.639> still<00:03:33.000> a<00:03:33.030> lot

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
yep but I'm afraid there's still a lot

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.180 
yep but I'm afraid there's still a lot
of<00:03:33.510> work<00:03:33.810> to<00:03:33.959> do<00:03:34.079> before<00:03:34.230> all<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:34.799> parts<00:03:35.069> and

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
of work to do before all the parts and

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.400 
of work to do before all the parts and
devices<00:03:35.730> in<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:35.940> registry<00:03:36.450> have<00:03:36.780> data<00:03:37.079> sheets
