00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.999 
kind of agree I mean I think that
Samsung<00:01:35.729> went<00:01:36.030> too<00:01:36.540> far<00:01:37.020> when<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.409> came<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.890> the

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
Samsung went too far when it came to the

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.800 
Samsung went too far when it came to the
tap<00:01:38.220> dancing<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:38.850> all<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.060> showing<00:01:39.570> and

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
tap dancing and all the showing and

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.899 
tap dancing and all the showing and
everything<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.619> they<00:01:40.740> pretty<00:01:40.979> much<00:01:41.189> removed

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
everything and they pretty much removed

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.969 
everything and they pretty much removed
the<00:01:42.060> spotlight<00:01:42.570> from<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.079> phone<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.710> feature

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
the spotlight from the phone to feature

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.950 
the spotlight from the phone to feature
all<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.340> tap<00:01:44.610> dancers<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.270> all<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.509> acting

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
all the tap dancers and all the acting

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.840 
all the tap dancers and all the acting
that<00:01:46.079> was<00:01:46.229> going<00:01:46.560> on<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.369> then<00:01:47.490> backs<00:01:47.700> to

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
that was going on and then backs to

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.179 
that was going on and then backs to
wonder<00:01:48.149> if<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.299> Galaxy<00:01:48.750> s4<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.320> as<00:01:49.740> cool<00:01:50.040> as

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
wonder if the Galaxy s4 is as cool as

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.490 
wonder if the Galaxy s4 is as cool as
they<00:01:50.369> say<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.299> then<00:01:51.659> again<00:01:51.869> Mackenzie

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
they say it is and then again Mackenzie

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.810 
they say it is and then again Mackenzie
also<00:01:52.799> went<00:01:52.979> on<00:01:53.009> record<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.340> state<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.700> the

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
also went on record to state that the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
HTC One is as a barrier device because

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.399 
HTC One is as a barrier device because
it's<00:01:56.430> made<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.759> aluminum<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.420> then<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:58.140> come

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
it's made of aluminum and then you come

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.600 
it's made of aluminum and then you come
to<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.649> point<00:01:58.860> where<00:01:59.009> some<00:01:59.189> people<00:01:59.310> just

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
to the point where some people just

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.280 
to the point where some people just
debate<00:01:59.909> I<00:01:59.939> mean<00:02:00.240> some<00:02:00.479> people<00:02:00.509> believe<00:02:01.020> that

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
debate I mean some people believe that

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.440 
debate I mean some people believe that

genius<00:02:38.370> I<00:02:38.519> wonder<00:02:38.849> why<00:02:38.969> other<00:02:39.389> companies<00:02:39.810> had

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
genius I wonder why other companies had

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.020 
genius I wonder why other companies had
not<00:02:40.260> figured<00:02:40.650> that<00:02:40.769> out<00:02:40.799> before<00:02:41.129> but<00:02:41.579> the

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
not figured that out before but the

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.550 
not figured that out before but the
interesting<00:02:42.389> part<00:02:42.599> is<00:02:42.780> that<00:02:42.810> apparently<00:02:43.230> this

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
interesting part is that apparently this

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.800 
interesting part is that apparently this
game<00:02:43.889> pad<00:02:44.189> according<00:02:44.939> to<00:02:45.030> specifications

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
leads me to the question of the day we

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.189 
leads me to the question of the day we
had<00:03:29.579> actually<00:03:30.000> in<00:03:30.090> a<00:03:30.180> tutorial<00:03:30.599> a<00:03:30.870> couple<00:03:31.139> of

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:31.199 
had actually in a tutorial a couple of

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:33.319 
had actually in a tutorial a couple of
weeks<00:03:31.409> ago<00:03:31.769> where<00:03:32.250> we<00:03:32.370> were<00:03:32.400> wondering<00:03:33.060> if<00:03:33.209> it

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
weeks ago where we were wondering if it

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.479 
weeks ago where we were wondering if it
would<00:03:33.479> be<00:03:33.629> great<00:03:33.959> to<00:03:34.139> have<00:03:34.349> a<00:03:34.590> la<00:03:34.709> carte<00:03:35.159> phones

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
would be great to have a la carte phones

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.580 
would be great to have a la carte phones
so<00:03:35.909> would<00:03:36.419> you<00:03:36.599> love<00:03:36.840> phones<00:03:37.290> that<00:03:37.530> are

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
so would you love phones that are

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.229 
so would you love phones that are
customisable<00:03:38.459> that's<00:03:38.729> actually<00:03:39.120> the

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
customisable that's actually the

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.089 
customisable that's actually the
question<00:03:39.449> would<00:03:40.109> you<00:03:40.139> prefer<00:03:40.470> a<00:03:40.620> phone<00:03:40.949> that

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
question would you prefer a phone that

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:42.289 
question would you prefer a phone that
you<00:03:41.159> could<00:03:41.310> tailor<00:03:41.639> to<00:03:41.790> your<00:03:41.819> own<00:03:42.030> specific

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
you could tailor to your own specific

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.689 
you could tailor to your own specific
needs<00:03:42.870> just<00:03:43.530> think<00:03:43.739> about<00:03:43.859> it<00:03:44.099> I<00:03:44.189> believe<00:03:44.549> that

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:44.699 
needs just think about it I believe that

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:46.640 
needs just think about it I believe that
this<00:03:44.819> is<00:03:44.879> a<00:03:45.000> genius<00:03:45.599> idea<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:46.259> phone<00:03:46.439> would<00:03:46.620> be

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
this is a genius idea the phone would be

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.499 
this is a genius idea the phone would be
sold<00:03:47.009> online<00:03:47.220> and<00:03:47.669> you<00:03:48.000> would<00:03:48.120> choose<00:03:48.299> your

sold online and you would choose your

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:50.960 
sold online and you would choose your
processor<00:03:49.109> your<00:03:49.379> color<00:03:49.739> your<00:03:50.340> amount<00:03:50.639> of<00:03:50.759> RAM

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
processor your color your amount of RAM

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.030 
processor your color your amount of RAM
absolutely<00:03:51.659> everything<00:03:52.049> your<00:03:52.349> display<00:03:52.769> in
