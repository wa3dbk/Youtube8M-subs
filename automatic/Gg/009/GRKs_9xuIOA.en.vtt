hair because I find that it's it's very

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.450 
hair because I find that it's it's very
thick<00:02:45.640> and<00:02:45.940> rich<00:02:46.720> and<00:02:47.050> it's<00:02:47.320> hard<00:02:47.740> to<00:02:47.830> wash<00:02:48.130> out

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
thick and rich and it's hard to wash out

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.490 
thick and rich and it's hard to wash out
like<00:02:49.000> you'll<00:02:49.240> see<00:02:49.330> when<00:02:49.720> you<00:02:49.810> put<00:02:50.080> it<00:02:50.170> on<00:02:50.290> your

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
like you'll see when you put it on your

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.830 
like you'll see when you put it on your
hands<00:02:50.920> if<00:02:51.010> you<00:02:51.160> have<00:02:51.190> to<00:02:51.850> wash<00:02:52.060> your<00:02:52.090> hands<00:02:52.570> for

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
hands if you have to wash your hands for

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.630 
hands if you have to wash your hands for
anything<00:02:53.050> you<00:02:53.290> want<00:02:53.500> to<00:02:53.590> wash<00:02:53.740> it<00:02:53.770> off<00:02:54.160> it's

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
anything you want to wash it off it's

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.830 
anything you want to wash it off it's
very<00:02:54.880> hard<00:02:55.150> to<00:02:55.210> get<00:02:55.390> off

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
very hard to get off

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.110 
very hard to get off
so<00:02:56.200> I<00:02:56.500> think<00:02:56.620> that<00:02:57.070> it<00:02:57.160> would<00:02:57.250> be<00:02:57.310> for<00:02:57.730> me<00:02:57.850> too

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
so I think that it would be for me too

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.880 
so I think that it would be for me too
