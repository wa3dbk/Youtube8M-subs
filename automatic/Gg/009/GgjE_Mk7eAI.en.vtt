very<00:04:23.770> Fifty<00:04:24.400> Shades<00:04:24.430> of

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.070 
Green as I've said before but she looks
like<00:04:28.550> she's<00:04:28.760> doing<00:04:28.910> a<00:04:29.180> really<00:04:29.210> good<00:04:29.780> job<00:04:30.020> here

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
like she's doing a really good job here

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.440 
like she's doing a really good job here
and<00:04:30.380> I<00:04:30.440> hope<00:04:30.620> it's<00:04:30.800> a<00:04:30.890> well-written<00:04:31.280> role<00:04:31.700> now

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
and I hope it's a well-written role now

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.180 
and I hope it's a well-written role now
the<00:04:32.540> only<00:04:32.780> potential<00:04:33.380> pitfall<00:04:33.830> for<00:04:34.070> this

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
the only potential pitfall for this

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.240 
the only potential pitfall for this
movie<00:04:34.580> is<00:04:35.180> that<00:04:35.540> if<00:04:35.810> you<00:04:35.990> have<00:04:36.140> a<00:04:36.170> black<00:04:36.950> lead

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
movie is that if you have a black lead

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.460 
movie is that if you have a black lead
and<00:04:37.550> a<00:04:37.700> white<00:04:38.270> female<00:04:38.570> lead<00:04:38.930> a<00:04:39.020> black<00:04:39.230> male

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
and a white female lead a black male

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.050 
and a white female lead a black male
lead<00:04:39.680> and<00:04:39.710> a<00:04:39.890> white<00:04:40.040> female<00:04:40.280> lead<00:04:40.640> now

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
lead and a white female lead now

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.820 
lead and a white female lead now
hopefully<00:04:41.330> this<00:04:41.870> won't<00:04:42.110> be<00:04:42.260> a<00:04:42.320> problem<00:04:42.500> is

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
hopefully this won't be a problem is

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
and on a decent budget so it didn't

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.880 
and on a decent budget so it didn't
really<00:05:44.090> hurt<00:05:44.300> that<00:05:44.540> film<00:05:44.810> too<00:05:44.990> much<00:05:45.200> but<00:05:45.740> as

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:45.890 
really hurt that film too much but as

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.770 
really hurt that film too much but as
you<00:05:45.980> can<00:05:46.130> see<00:05:46.280> black<00:05:46.820> male<00:05:47.060> actors<00:05:47.390> have<00:05:47.570> to<00:05:47.690> be

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
you can see black male actors have to be

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.600 
you can see black male actors have to be
very<00:05:48.020> careful<00:05:48.680> but<00:05:48.770> maybe<00:05:48.950> those<00:05:49.190> days<00:05:49.220> are

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
very careful but maybe those days are

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.310 
very careful but maybe those days are
numbered<00:05:49.700> maybe<00:05:50.120> this<00:05:50.690> will<00:05:50.900> be<00:05:50.990> the<00:05:51.110> film

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.320 
numbered maybe this will be the film

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.650 
numbered maybe this will be the film
focus<00:05:51.830> which<00:05:52.310> really<00:05:52.520> shows<00:05:52.820> that<00:05:53.120> that's<00:05:53.390> no

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:53.660 
focus which really shows that that's no

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.390 
focus which really shows that that's no

so<00:06:57.830> let's<00:06:58.009> see<00:06:58.129> if<00:06:58.219> this<00:06:58.370> one<00:06:58.550> can<00:06:58.580> hold<00:06:58.909> a

00:06:58.990 --> 00:06:59.000 
so let's see if this one can hold a

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.249 
so let's see if this one can hold a
candle<00:06:59.150> to<00:06:59.389> those<00:06:59.629> but<00:06:59.810> I<00:06:59.900> think<00:07:00.080> at<00:07:00.139> the<00:07:00.229> very

00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:00.259 
candle to those but I think at the very

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:02.740 
candle to those but I think at the very
least<00:07:00.469> it<00:07:00.830> looks<00:07:00.979> like<00:07:01.099> a<00:07:01.129> fun<00:07:02.000> you<00:07:02.389> know<00:07:02.509> could

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:02.750 
least it looks like a fun you know could

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.570 
least it looks like a fun you know could
have<00:07:02.870> a<00:07:02.900> mr.<00:07:03.229> and<00:07:03.349> mrs.<00:07:03.620> Smith<00:07:03.830> kind<00:07:04.280> of<00:07:04.400> vibe

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:04.580 
have a mr. and mrs. Smith kind of vibe

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.010 
have a mr. and mrs. Smith kind of vibe
to<00:07:04.879> it<00:07:04.909> that's<00:07:05.180> going<00:07:05.330> on<00:07:05.509> there<00:07:05.659> because<00:07:05.780> of

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:06.020 
to it that's going on there because of

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:07.929 
to it that's going on there because of
the<00:07:06.110> intense<00:07:06.439> interest<00:07:06.800> from<00:07:06.919> male<00:07:07.430> audiences

00:07:07.929 --> 00:07:07.939 
the intense interest from male audiences

00:07:07.939 --> 00:07:09.850 
the intense interest from male audiences
in<00:07:08.090> Margot<00:07:08.389> Robbie<00:07:08.750> and<00:07:08.900> then<00:07:08.960> of<00:07:09.439> course<00:07:09.469> Will

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:09.860 
in Margot Robbie and then of course Will

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.830 
in Margot Robbie and then of course Will
Smith<00:07:10.099> back<00:07:10.580> in<00:07:10.789> top<00:07:10.939> form<00:07:11.210> I<00:07:11.389> think<00:07:11.419> the<00:07:11.690> very

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.840 
Smith back in top form I think the very

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.020 
Smith back in top form I think the very
least<00:07:12.139> if<00:07:12.469> it's<00:07:12.830> not<00:07:12.949> a<00:07:12.979> memorable<00:07:13.460> film<00:07:13.729> it

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:14.030 
least if it's not a memorable film it

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:15.850 
least if it's not a memorable film it
would<00:07:14.150> be<00:07:14.300> a<00:07:14.330> strong<00:07:14.629> box-office<00:07:15.139> performer

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:15.860 
would be a strong box-office performer

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.980 
would be a strong box-office performer
potentially<00:07:16.550> if<00:07:16.879> it's<00:07:17.210> not<00:07:17.360> undone<00:07:17.659> by<00:07:17.840> that

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:17.990 
potentially if it's not undone by that

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.809 
potentially if it's not undone by that
one<00:07:18.229> problem<00:07:18.830> alright<00:07:19.310> or<00:07:19.460> the<00:07:19.729> other

00:07:19.809 --> 00:07:19.819 
one problem alright or the other

00:07:19.819 --> 00:07:21.850 
one problem alright or the other
problems<00:07:20.240> like<00:07:20.330> a<00:07:20.659> sloppy<00:07:21.590> predictable

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:21.860 
problems like a sloppy predictable

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.860 
problems like a sloppy predictable
