 its shorter work will be greater 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.730

 window with a small group of people 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.620
 The closer we call the kitchen to 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.070
 social life is practically not going to 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.230
 to give up 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.160

 efficiency of common sense goes 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.900
 reduce your friends to almost zero 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.670
 cooking will be as painful as

 met someone of weight according to all 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.239
 restaurant that lends itself to a 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.130
 pedro worker according to your

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.300
 floor level has developed a 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.190
 strange obsession with knives 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.070
 you think will be the last cookie 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.720
 package be treated you will never be 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.370
 irreplaceable will always have someone who 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.820
 Do a job as good as yours. 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.110
 you'll be 200% at your job 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.959
 Are you going to put in your work today? 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.300
 Anything else excuses like pain. 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:03.150
 belly and a dog died all 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.519
 Ente and lyon will be good for you. 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.049
 late to the work of the hand is to stop 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.720
 cook for you because she feels 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.640
 intimidated and will work for many years 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.130
 in the lowest degree of hierarchy of a 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.019
 cooking is to achieve a position with the 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.340
 degree of authority inside what 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.410
 it also means nothing 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.450
 my theory is the following the better 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.340
 restaurant is the greatest journey 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.500
 work pressure increases within the 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.269
 kitchen with more people 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.920
 pulling the bag greater amount of 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.239
 people wanting to knock you down even though 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.310
 You do not want to be competing with 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.140
 no one else will be your quality of 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.720
 life will be your rest time 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.760
 the lowest salary and will spend to save your 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.739
 money with books and 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.120
 kitchen restaurant and it is not very shade 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.489
 money to do something else not 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.170
 but now you're the right kind of person 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.480
 if you have a profile and qualities 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.930
 attributes my friend you will love your 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.930
