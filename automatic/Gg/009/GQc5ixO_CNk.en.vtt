00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
it's a bit cacophonous and it's

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.429 
it's a bit cacophonous and it's
beautiful<00:01:17.250> but<00:01:17.670> there<00:01:17.850> are<00:01:18.150> moments<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.840> anger

beautiful but there are moments of anger
in<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.920> or<00:01:20.189> extreme<00:01:21.650> it<00:01:22.650> can<00:01:23.100> make<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.340> very
