one of the first things I noticed this
difference<00:02:11.060> this<00:02:11.299> camera<00:02:11.690> is<00:02:11.840> that<00:02:11.870> it<00:02:12.170> has

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
difference this camera is that it has

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.699 
difference this camera is that it has
the<00:02:12.769> added<00:02:12.920> shop<00:02:13.370> guards<00:02:13.760> on<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.060> corners<00:02:14.420> and

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
the added shop guards on the corners and

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:21.880 
the added shop guards on the corners and
also<00:02:18.519> in<00:02:19.519> order<00:02:19.760> to<00:02:19.910> open<00:02:20.209> it<00:02:20.390> you<00:02:20.739> need<00:02:21.739> to

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
also in order to open it you need to

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.420 
also in order to open it you need to
hold<00:02:22.130> down<00:02:22.250> this<00:02:22.730> lever<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:23.390> slide<00:02:24.430> whereas

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
hold down this lever and slide whereas

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.920 
hold down this lever and slide whereas
with<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:25.700> old<00:02:25.819> camera<00:02:26.120> you<00:02:26.360> would<00:02:26.510> just<00:02:26.660> slide

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
with the old camera you would just slide

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.059 
with the old camera you would just slide
the<00:02:27.860> switch<00:02:28.040> and<00:02:28.459> then<00:02:28.880> open<00:02:29.209> and<00:02:29.590> also<00:02:30.590> on

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
the switch and then open and also on

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.220 
the switch and then open and also on
closing<00:02:31.489> this<00:02:31.819> it<00:02:32.630> locks<00:02:32.870> closed

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
closing this it locks closed

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.050 
closing this it locks closed
automatically<00:02:33.920> whereas<00:02:34.519> with<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:34.790> older

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
automatically whereas with the older

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.569 
automatically whereas with the older
camera<00:02:35.450> you<00:02:36.140> had<00:02:36.290> to<00:02:36.410> close<00:02:36.590> it<00:02:36.859> and<00:02:36.980> then<00:02:37.310> lock

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
camera you had to close it and then lock

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:40.990 
camera you had to close it and then lock
it<00:02:37.609> manually<00:02:38.829> so<00:02:39.829> what<00:02:40.370> I'm<00:02:40.459> going<00:02:40.609> to<00:02:40.640> do<00:02:40.820> is

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
it manually so what I'm going to do is

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.130 
it manually so what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:02:41.150> going<00:02:41.180> to<00:02:41.329> add<00:02:41.450> a<00:02:42.940> four<00:02:43.940> gig<00:02:44.209> memory<00:02:44.959> card

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
I'm going to add a four gig memory card

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.520 
I'm going to add a four gig memory card
that<00:02:45.590> I<00:02:45.620> purchased<00:02:46.930> does<00:02:47.930> not<00:02:48.109> come<00:02:48.350> with<00:02:48.500> a

basically<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.500> same<00:04:13.680> size<00:04:13.920> but<00:04:14.340> this<00:04:15.209> screen

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
basically the same size but this screen

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.990 
basically the same size but this screen
is<00:04:16.440> not<00:04:17.160> as<00:04:17.430> nice<00:04:18.090> looking<00:04:18.540> as<00:04:18.989> the<00:04:19.230> new<00:04:19.380> camera

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
is not as nice looking as the new camera

is not as nice looking as the new camera
the<00:04:21.630> buttons<00:04:21.959> are<00:04:22.080> basically<00:04:22.440> the<00:04:22.560> same<00:04:22.590> but

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
the buttons are basically the same but

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.820 
the buttons are basically the same but
they're<00:04:23.669> in<00:04:23.760> a<00:04:23.850> different<00:04:24.270> arrangement<00:04:24.830> this

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
they're in a different arrangement this

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.700 
they're in a different arrangement this
old<00:04:26.070> camera<00:04:26.310> has<00:04:26.640> a<00:04:27.030> little<00:04:27.660> thumb<00:04:27.930> kind<00:04:28.560> of

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
old camera has a little thumb kind of

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.659 
old camera has a little thumb kind of
hold<00:04:28.890> here<00:04:29.270> that<00:04:30.270> goes<00:04:30.450> across<00:04:30.600> the<00:04:30.960> camera

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
hold here that goes across the camera

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:33.650 
hold here that goes across the camera
whereas<00:04:32.669> the<00:04:32.820> new<00:04:32.940> one<00:04:33.090> just<00:04:33.120> has<00:04:33.450> a<00:04:33.480> little

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
whereas the new one just has a little

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.350 
whereas the new one just has a little
portion<00:04:34.410> there<00:04:36.260> difference<00:04:37.260> in<00:04:37.680> the<00:04:37.800> front

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
portion there difference in the front

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.780 
portion there difference in the front
not<00:04:39.360> a<00:04:39.419> whole<00:04:39.570> lot<00:04:39.720> of<00:04:39.750> different<00:04:40.140> splash<00:04:40.790> lens

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
not a whole lot of different splash lens

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.190 
not a whole lot of different splash lens
seems<00:04:42.120> to<00:04:42.240> be<00:04:42.360> a<00:04:42.390> little<00:04:42.750> larger<00:04:43.320> looking<00:04:45.020> in<00:04:46.020> a

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
seems to be a little larger looking in a

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.980 
seems to be a little larger looking in a
different<00:04:47.040> style<00:04:47.250> the<00:04:48.000> camera<00:04:48.330> itself<00:04:48.660> is

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
different style the camera itself is

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.080 
different style the camera itself is
probably<00:04:49.380> just<00:04:49.620> a<00:04:49.800> little<00:04:50.130> bit<00:04:50.520> smaller<00:04:50.880> on

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
probably just a little bit smaller on

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.450 
probably just a little bit smaller on
the<00:04:51.210> new<00:04:51.360> one<00:04:51.570> and<00:04:51.810> just<00:04:52.680> a<00:04:52.860> touch<00:04:53.130> lighter

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
the new one and just a touch lighter

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.090 
the new one and just a touch lighter
than<00:04:53.729> this<00:04:53.880> one<00:04:54.260> but<00:04:55.260> other<00:04:55.410> than<00:04:55.680> that<00:04:55.770> it's

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
than this one but other than that it's

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.360 
than this one but other than that it's
pretty<00:04:56.490> much<00:04:56.669> the<00:04:57.090> same<00:04:57.890> in<00:04:58.890> appearance

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
pretty much the same in appearance

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.780 
pretty much the same in appearance
