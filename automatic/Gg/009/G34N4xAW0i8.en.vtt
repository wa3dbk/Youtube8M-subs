00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.180
 Special taste is different and how it is 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:26.320
 cast in the shell stays in the 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:28.690

 when there is a stew that is not going to 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:34.930
 colar you get it very well but if you 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:37.389
 It does not matter, it gives better flavor 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.260
