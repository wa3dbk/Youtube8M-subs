00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.700
 the lady 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.810
 We'll start by taking off the sleeves. 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.789
 we do not need them after all if you 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.859
 You may want to fold the fabric to 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.519
 to be able to score better where you go 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.519
 cut 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.270
 after that I shot the bar of our 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.270
 T-shirt 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.150
 I'll cut some more then you. 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.170
 dress to see if we are also to 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.760
 you want 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.760
 I do like a v 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.520
 now take angola 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.960
 After I wore a blouse I saw that I 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:05.140
 I wanted more side dug then I 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.570
 I cut the sleeve and the handle I wanted her well 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.320
 Then I cut the top of the 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.570
 And then you see , we do not go down until 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.580
 down with the scissors so you do not get too 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.650
 dug down and just over after 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.650
 That's all it takes to make adjustments 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.110
 I'll short 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:28.930
 the other side with her folded 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.930
 can not score is not so crooked 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.710
 she stayed like this now I'm going to fold 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.909
 able to dig a little bit more from 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.180
 of the back 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:43.030
 then double it the middle next to 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.159
 of the handles by the straight heads and 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.550
 then I come with the scissors cutting 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.380
 this back and then you cut and 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.050
 dress to see if it's the way you are 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.590
 or if you do not have one more 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.590
 little 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.240
 Then I had already worn the T-shirt after 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.850
 I just cut back a little bit more 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.420
 from behind but as soon as she's done that's the 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.420
 final result 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.480
 then it is only you stretch the fabric you 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.360
 stretches on the part of the handles and is also 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:28.670
 on the side and chica on the side 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.670
 underneath the shirt and it will be ready 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.740

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.270
