00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.650 
okay I'm getting ready to do one of the

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.610 
okay I'm getting ready to do one of the
last<00:00:01.829> front<00:00:02.220> loader<00:00:02.399> in<00:00:02.610> ESS<00:00:03.030> for<00:00:03.689> the<00:00:03.990> second

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
last front loader in ESS for the second

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.579 
last front loader in ESS for the second
group<00:00:04.710> order<00:00:05.040> people<00:00:05.490> and<00:00:05.899> this<00:00:06.899> guy<00:00:07.109> once

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
group order people and this guy once

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.780 
group order people and this guy once
sort<00:00:08.490> of<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:08.730> hidden<00:00:08.940> switch<00:00:09.240> done<00:00:09.719> and<00:00:10.639> he<00:00:11.639> just

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
sort of a hidden switch done and he just

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:12.890 
sort of a hidden switch done and he just
kept<00:00:11.969> saying<00:00:12.269> he<00:00:12.330> just<00:00:12.509> didn't<00:00:12.690> want<00:00:12.840> it

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
kept saying he just didn't want it

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.959 
kept saying he just didn't want it
matted<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.380> outside<00:00:13.799> or<00:00:14.009> whatever<00:00:14.280> just

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
matted to the outside or whatever just

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.970 
matted to the outside or whatever just
wanted<00:00:15.179> an<00:00:15.299> inside<00:00:15.690> well<00:00:16.049> I<00:00:16.080> think<00:00:16.289> I<00:00:16.619> may<00:00:16.859> have

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
wanted an inside well I think I may have

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.330 
wanted an inside well I think I may have
found<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:18.260> way<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.320> put<00:00:19.680> one<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.010> smaller

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
found a way to put one of the smaller

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.220 
found a way to put one of the smaller
switches<00:00:20.820> it's<00:00:21.449> just<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.750> single-pole

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
switches it's just a single-pole

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.540 
switches it's just a single-pole
double-throw<00:00:23.300> because<00:00:24.300> all<00:00:24.539> he<00:00:24.720> wants<00:00:25.140> is

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
double-throw because all he wants is

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.279 
double-throw because all he wants is
composite<00:00:26.550> pallet<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.810> be<00:00:27.900> able<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.109> turn

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
composite pallet and to be able to turn

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.250 
composite pallet and to be able to turn
it<00:00:28.380> off<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.609> use<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:30.000> original<00:00:30.260> composite

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
it off and to use the original composite

video<00:00:31.349> output<00:00:31.880> over<00:00:32.880> here<00:00:33.090> actually<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:34.070> I

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
video output over here actually and I

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.319 
video output over here actually and I
was<00:00:35.309> looking<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.790> thought<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.120> know<00:00:36.180> what<00:00:36.300> I

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
was looking I thought you know what I

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.360 
was looking I thought you know what I
could<00:00:36.600> probably<00:00:36.840> just<00:00:36.989> lay<00:00:37.739> that<00:00:37.770> switch

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
could probably just lay that switch

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.450 
could probably just lay that switch
right<00:00:39.530> there<00:00:40.530> on<00:00:40.680> top<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.070> hole<00:00:41.280> like

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
right there on top of that hole like

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.229 
right there on top of that hole like
that<00:00:42.020> and<00:00:43.020> just<00:00:43.399> hot<00:00:44.399> glue<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.640> down<00:00:44.760> since<00:00:45.120> it

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
that and just hot glue it down since it

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.799 
that and just hot glue it down since it
doesn't<00:00:45.539> take<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.780> lot<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:45.930> force<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.440> move<00:00:46.469> it

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
doesn't take a lot of force to move it

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.139 
doesn't take a lot of force to move it
and<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.590> be<00:00:49.739> easy<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.039> remove<00:00:50.250> also<00:00:50.670> here<00:00:50.940> once

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
and so be easy to remove also here once

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:58.369 
and so be easy to remove also here once
-<00:00:52.129> and<00:00:53.539> that<00:00:54.539> way<00:00:54.719> it'll<00:00:55.020> also<00:00:56.780> my<00:00:57.780> light<00:00:58.020> over

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
- and that way it'll also my light over

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.200 
- and that way it'll also my light over
here<00:01:00.469> it'll<00:01:01.469> just<00:01:01.680> kind<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:01.890> be<00:01:01.949> hidden<00:01:02.280> right

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
here it'll just kind of be hidden right

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:16.230 
here it'll just kind of be hidden right
about<00:01:03.390> like<00:01:03.539> that

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.820 

just<00:01:17.240> kind<00:01:17.420> of<00:01:17.450> making<00:01:17.600> this<00:01:17.780> video<00:01:18.020> for<00:01:18.440> the

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
just kind of making this video for the

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.320 
just kind of making this video for the
customer<00:01:19.250> so<00:01:19.280> he<00:01:19.490> can<00:01:19.640> kind<00:01:19.760> of<00:01:19.850> get<00:01:19.970> an<00:01:20.060> idea

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
customer so he can kind of get an idea

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.960 
customer so he can kind of get an idea
of<00:01:20.390> what<00:01:20.600> it'll<00:01:20.720> look<00:01:20.870> like

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
of what it'll look like

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.530 
of what it'll look like
you<00:01:22.970> can<00:01:23.090> still<00:01:23.300> operate<00:01:23.450> both<00:01:23.810> switches<00:01:24.250> and

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
you can still operate both switches and

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.860 
you can still operate both switches and
in<00:01:26.540> of<00:01:26.870> course<00:01:27.110> one<00:01:27.470> that<00:01:27.590> NES<00:01:27.860> RDV<00:01:28.250> is<00:01:28.370> off<00:01:28.870> the

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:29.870 
in of course one that NES RDV is off the

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.900 
in of course one that NES RDV is off the
RF<00:01:30.260> app<00:01:30.410> that<00:01:30.590> will<00:01:30.710> still<00:01:30.890> work<00:01:31.010> too<00:01:31.340> as<00:01:31.700> far

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
RF app that will still work too as far

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.719 
RF app that will still work too as far
as<00:01:31.940> I<00:01:32.090> know<00:01:33.610> I've<00:01:34.610> only<00:01:34.700> had<00:01:35.030> one<00:01:35.300> person<00:01:35.570> ask

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
as I know I've only had one person ask

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.160 
as I know I've only had one person ask
for<00:01:37.729> the<00:01:38.570> ability<00:01:38.720> to<00:01:38.900> turn<00:01:39.110> off<00:01:39.260> the<00:01:39.410> NES<00:01:39.680> RGB

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
for the ability to turn off the NES RGB

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.290 
for the ability to turn off the NES RGB
so<00:01:42.170> this<00:01:43.070> little<00:01:43.310> kind<00:01:43.580> of<00:01:43.640> new<00:01:43.790> territory<00:01:44.270> for

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
so this little kind of new territory for

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.260 
so this little kind of new territory for
me<00:01:44.420> to<00:01:45.220> I<00:01:46.220> do<00:01:46.430> want<00:01:46.550> to<00:01:46.700> make<00:01:46.820> sure<00:01:47.000> that<00:01:47.120> it

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
me to I do want to make sure that it

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.550 
me to I do want to make sure that it
will<00:01:47.330> work<00:01:47.510> right<00:01:49.240> so<00:01:50.240> anyway<00:01:50.630> this<00:01:50.840> a<00:01:51.259> rough

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
will work right so anyway this a rough

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.840 
will work right so anyway this a rough
idea<00:01:51.830> of<00:01:51.860> what<00:01:52.009> it<00:01:52.130> would<00:01:52.220> look<00:01:52.369> like<00:01:52.430> right

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
idea of what it would look like right

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.630 
idea of what it would look like right
there<00:01:53.180> I<00:01:53.590> was<00:01:54.590> kind<00:01:54.800> of<00:01:55.160> looking<00:01:55.280> at<00:01:55.520> the

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
there I was kind of looking at the

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.870 
there I was kind of looking at the
events<00:01:56.150> you<00:01:56.800> know<00:01:57.800> just<00:01:57.979> having<00:01:58.160> a<00:01:58.310> quick

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
events you know just having a quick

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.830 
events you know just having a quick
access<00:01:59.170> just<00:02:00.170> that<00:02:01.040> whatever<00:02:01.690> even<00:02:02.690> if<00:02:02.720> you

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
access just that whatever even if you

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.830 
access just that whatever even if you
had<00:02:02.960> to<00:02:03.050> use<00:02:03.200> a<00:02:03.229> pencil<00:02:03.650> or<00:02:03.830> something<00:02:04.250> but<00:02:04.430> the

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
had to use a pencil or something but the

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.120 
had to use a pencil or something but the
the<00:02:05.840> width<00:02:06.080> of<00:02:06.200> the<00:02:06.320> lever<00:02:06.530> on<00:02:06.800> the<00:02:06.950> switch

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
the width of the lever on the switch

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.460 
the width of the lever on the switch
itself<00:02:07.490> will<00:02:07.700> not<00:02:07.880> fit<00:02:08.770> through<00:02:09.770> those<00:02:09.979> vents

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
itself will not fit through those vents

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.100 
itself will not fit through those vents
without<00:02:12.470> widening<00:02:13.430> them<00:02:13.640> or<00:02:13.850> narrowing<00:02:14.840> this

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
without widening them or narrowing this

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.960 
without widening them or narrowing this
so<00:02:15.680> that's<00:02:15.890> kind<00:02:16.160> of<00:02:16.190> out<00:02:16.340> but<00:02:16.520> I<00:02:16.580> think<00:02:16.820> that

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
so that's kind of out but I think that

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.960 
so that's kind of out but I think that
would<00:02:17.090> be<00:02:17.120> a<00:02:17.480> super<00:02:18.320> easy<00:02:18.530> place<00:02:19.489> to<00:02:19.640> put<00:02:19.820> that

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
would be a super easy place to put that

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.940 
would be a super easy place to put that
and<00:02:20.209> still<00:02:20.480> have<00:02:20.690> access<00:02:20.930> to<00:02:21.200> without<00:02:21.739> really

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
and still have access to without really

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.460 
and still have access to without really
modifying<00:02:22.550> the<00:02:23.480> console<00:02:23.930> at<00:02:24.050> all<00:02:24.170> and<00:02:24.350> I<00:02:24.440> mean

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
modifying the console at all and I mean

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.660 
modifying the console at all and I mean
we're<00:02:24.709> already<00:02:24.830> putting<00:02:25.040> a<00:02:25.130> multi<00:02:25.400> out<00:02:25.489> on<00:02:25.580> the

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
we're already putting a multi out on the

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:26.979 
we're already putting a multi out on the
back<00:02:25.820> so<00:02:26.030> it's<00:02:26.180> not<00:02:26.269> like<00:02:26.450> it's<00:02:26.630> gonna<00:02:26.750> be

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
back so it's not like it's gonna be

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.790 
back so it's not like it's gonna be
completely<00:02:27.769> stuck<00:02:28.340> either<00:02:28.640> so<00:02:29.560> that's<00:02:30.560> just

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
completely stuck either so that's just
