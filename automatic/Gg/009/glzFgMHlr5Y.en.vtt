I'd<00:00:09.420> make<00:00:09.630> a<00:00:09.660> quick<00:00:10.080> video<00:00:10.290> on<00:00:10.500> it<00:00:10.830> it's<00:00:11.580> really

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
I'd make a quick video on it it's really

I'd make a quick video on it it's really
pretty<00:00:12.170> and<00:00:14.780> it's<00:00:15.780> pretty<00:00:16.020> cool<00:00:16.289> because<00:00:16.949> it

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
pretty and it's pretty cool because it

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.420 
pretty and it's pretty cool because it
gives<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:18.170> it<00:00:19.170> may<00:00:19.320> look<00:00:19.650> old<00:00:19.949> but<00:00:20.160> it<00:00:20.279> also

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
gives a it may look old but it also

so<00:01:48.360> let's<00:01:48.899> get<00:01:49.079> cracking<00:01:49.490> you're<00:01:50.490> going<00:01:50.640> to

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
so let's get cracking you're going to

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.160 
so let's get cracking you're going to
need<00:01:50.820> hot<00:01:51.180> -<00:01:51.630> hot<00:01:53.600> -

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
need hot - hot -

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.030 
need hot - hot -
warm<00:01:55.860> warm<00:01:56.220> to<00:01:56.400> hot<00:01:56.520> water<00:01:57.650> it<00:01:58.650> doesn't<00:01:58.860> have

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
warm warm to hot water it doesn't have

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.450 
warm warm to hot water it doesn't have
to<00:01:59.130> be<00:01:59.250> scalding<00:01:59.730> hot<00:01:59.760> or<00:02:00.090> anything

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.480 

and<00:02:04.990> it<00:02:05.990> helps<00:02:06.290> to<00:02:06.350> be<00:02:06.500> able<00:02:06.620> to<00:02:06.740> submerge<00:02:07.190> the

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
and it helps to be able to submerge the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.999 
and it helps to be able to submerge the
sheep<00:02:07.810> but<00:02:08.810> I<00:02:09.110> don't<00:02:09.410> think<00:02:09.590> that's<00:02:09.770> totally

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
sheep but I don't think that's totally

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:17.730 
sheep but I don't think that's totally
necessary<00:02:11.320> so<00:02:12.320> there's<00:02:13.130> our<00:02:13.280> hot<00:02:13.490> water<00:02:14.260> and

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.660 

we're<00:02:18.740> going<00:02:18.860> to<00:02:18.890> get<00:02:19.040> this<00:02:19.190> wet<00:02:19.430> we're

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
we're going to get this wet we're

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:20.800 
we're going to get this wet we're
actually<00:02:19.790> going<00:02:20.000> to<00:02:20.060> fill<00:02:20.270> it<00:02:20.390> up<00:02:20.480> with<00:02:20.540> water

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
actually going to fill it up with water

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.300 
actually going to fill it up with water
as<00:02:21.050> you<00:02:21.200> can<00:02:21.380> see<00:02:21.730> and<00:02:22.730> it'll<00:02:23.240> start<00:02:23.510> to<00:02:23.570> become

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
as you can see and it'll start to become

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.010 
as you can see and it'll start to become
you'll<00:02:25.310> kind<00:02:25.550> of<00:02:25.640> know<00:02:25.820> when<00:02:26.090> there's<00:02:26.270> a<00:02:26.360> when

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
you'll kind of know when there's a when

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.780 
you'll kind of know when there's a when
it's<00:02:27.170> got<00:02:27.530> when<00:02:27.710> it's<00:02:27.860> saturated<00:02:28.100> enough

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
it's got when it's saturated enough

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.430 
it's got when it's saturated enough
because<00:02:29.630> it'll<00:02:29.870> get<00:02:30.050> really<00:02:30.230> kind<00:02:30.590> of<00:02:30.680> flimsy

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
because it'll get really kind of flimsy

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.470 
because it'll get really kind of flimsy
like<00:02:33.440> it's<00:02:33.620> doing<00:02:33.860> right<00:02:34.010> now<00:02:34.070> and<00:02:35.030> it'll<00:02:35.300> lose

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
like it's doing right now and it'll lose

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.790 
like it's doing right now and it'll lose
all<00:02:35.720> shape<00:02:36.020> that<00:02:36.230> it<00:02:36.380> had<00:02:38.410> this<00:02:39.410> one's<00:02:39.590> got<00:02:39.770> a

itself is very flimsy and that's a good
indication<00:02:55.610> that<00:02:56.270> it's<00:02:58.510> ready<00:02:59.510> but<00:03:00.260> I'm<00:03:00.440> gonna

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
indication that it's ready but I'm gonna

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.699 
indication that it's ready but I'm gonna
go<00:03:00.800> a<00:03:00.830> little<00:03:01.010> farther<00:03:01.459> just<00:03:01.820> for<00:03:02.530> just<00:03:03.530> for

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
go a little farther just for just for

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.060 
go a little farther just for just for
kicks

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.160 

now<00:03:07.070> if<00:03:07.280> you<00:03:07.490> if<00:03:08.240> you're<00:03:08.480> if<00:03:08.840> you're<00:03:09.019> doing

now if you if you're if you're doing
this<00:03:09.320> with<00:03:09.380> a<00:03:09.530> carbon<00:03:10.010> blade<00:03:10.250> and

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
this with a carbon blade and

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.870 
this with a carbon blade and
you<00:03:12.690> care<00:03:12.960> about<00:03:13.230> staining<00:03:15.200> you<00:03:16.200> know<00:03:16.880> make

you care about staining you know make

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.370 
you care about staining you know make
sure<00:03:18.090> you<00:03:18.210> wash<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.660> knife<00:03:18.840> as<00:03:19.020> soon<00:03:19.200> as<00:03:19.290> you

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
sure you wash the knife as soon as you

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.410 
sure you wash the knife as soon as you
take<00:03:19.590> it<00:03:19.740> out<00:03:20.330> otherwise<00:03:21.530> you<00:03:23.000> will<00:03:24.000> get<00:03:24.240> some

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
take it out otherwise you will get some

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.180 
take it out otherwise you will get some
staining<00:03:24.750> on<00:03:25.020> there<00:03:25.320> in<00:03:25.890> this<00:03:26.010> particular

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
staining on there in this particular

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.540 
staining on there in this particular
case<00:03:26.760> I<00:03:26.940> don't<00:03:27.000> really<00:03:27.300> care<00:03:27.600> so<00:03:28.490> now<00:03:29.490> that

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
case I don't really care so now that

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.700 
case I don't really care so now that
it's<00:03:29.970> good<00:03:30.210> and<00:03:30.330> why<00:03:30.450> you<00:03:31.200> want<00:03:31.350> to<00:03:31.440> put<00:03:31.590> the

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
it's good and why you want to put the

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:37.430 
it's good and why you want to put the
knife<00:03:31.890> in<00:03:32.160> there<00:03:35.420> feeling<00:03:36.420> where<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:37.080> bottom

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
knife in there feeling where the bottom

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.130 
knife in there feeling where the bottom
is<00:03:37.970> so<00:03:38.970> you<00:03:39.030> don't<00:03:39.210> poke<00:03:39.420> out<00:03:39.600> the<00:03:39.630> bottom

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
is so you don't poke out the bottom

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.940 
is so you don't poke out the bottom
because<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:41.900> so<00:03:42.900> that's<00:03:43.080> about<00:03:43.230> right<00:03:43.650> right

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
because the so that's about right right

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.580 
because the so that's about right right
there<00:03:44.340> and<00:03:45.330> then<00:03:45.630> you're<00:03:45.720> just<00:03:45.959> going<00:03:46.170> to<00:03:46.200> form

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
there and then you're just going to form

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.830 
there and then you're just going to form
it<00:03:47.390> with<00:03:48.390> your<00:03:48.570> hands<00:03:49.400> to<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:50.550> shape<00:03:50.850> of<00:03:51.090> the

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
it with your hands to the shape of the

00:03:51.840 --> 00:04:01.190 
it with your hands to the shape of the
knife<00:03:53.000> like<00:03:54.000> so<00:03:55.970> and<00:03:56.970> trace<00:03:57.660> around<00:03:59.930> the<00:04:00.930> blade

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
knife like so and trace around the blade

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.590 
knife like so and trace around the blade
kind<00:04:02.100> of<00:04:02.250> pinching<00:04:05.000> this<00:04:06.000> is<00:04:06.180> a<00:04:06.209> good<00:04:06.450> example

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
kind of pinching this is a good example

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.180 
kind of pinching this is a good example
because<00:04:06.990> the<00:04:07.410> knife<00:04:07.620> has<00:04:09.290> those<00:04:10.290> finger<00:04:10.740> kind

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
because the knife has those finger kind

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.810 
because the knife has those finger kind
of<00:04:11.370> finger<00:04:11.700> grooves<00:04:13.459> so<00:04:14.459> we're<00:04:14.640> going<00:04:14.730> to

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
of finger grooves so we're going to

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.580 
of finger grooves so we're going to
squeeze<00:04:15.090> right<00:04:15.330> around<00:04:15.540> there<00:04:15.870> so<00:04:16.200> that<00:04:16.350> the

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
squeeze right around there so that the

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:23.630 
squeeze right around there so that the
you<00:04:17.549> get<00:04:17.700> a<00:04:17.730> good<00:04:17.940> outline<00:04:18.299> of<00:04:18.359> the<00:04:18.660> knife<00:04:22.640> and

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
you get a good outline of the knife and

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:31.579 
you get a good outline of the knife and
just<00:04:23.669> do<00:04:24.270> that<00:04:24.419> all<00:04:24.480> the<00:04:24.660> way<00:04:25.080> around

00:04:31.579 --> 00:04:31.589 

00:04:31.589 --> 00:04:39.510 

like<00:04:32.249> so

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.140 

I<00:04:39.550> like<00:04:40.120> to<00:04:40.240> do<00:04:40.360> it<00:04:40.509> kind<00:04:40.780> of<00:04:40.900> a<00:04:41.790> you<00:04:42.790> know<00:04:42.850> kind

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
I like to do it kind of a you know kind

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:57.060 
I like to do it kind of a you know kind
of<00:04:43.180> like<00:04:43.330> that<00:04:43.690> kind<00:04:44.910> of<00:04:45.910> in<00:04:45.970> one<00:04:46.150> motion<00:04:56.070> kind

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
of like that kind of in one motion kind

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:03.420 
of like that kind of in one motion kind
of<00:04:57.130> smooth<00:04:57.460> it<00:04:57.610> out<00:04:57.789> like<00:04:58.060> that

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.340 

so<00:05:04.000> you<00:05:04.090> can<00:05:04.240> see<00:05:04.389> the<00:05:04.509> shape<00:05:04.750> of<00:05:04.840> the<00:05:04.900> handle

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
so you can see the shape of the handle

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.230 
so you can see the shape of the handle
fairly<00:05:05.770> clearly<00:05:07.860> and<00:05:08.910> yeah<00:05:09.910> and<00:05:10.120> there's

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
fairly clearly and yeah and there's

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.930 
fairly clearly and yeah and there's
really<00:05:10.360> no<00:05:10.800> right<00:05:11.800> amount<00:05:12.130> of<00:05:12.220> time<00:05:12.460> as<00:05:12.669> far<00:05:12.850> as

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
really no right amount of time as far as

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.740 
really no right amount of time as far as
how<00:05:13.090> long<00:05:13.300> to<00:05:13.449> do<00:05:13.600> it<00:05:14.250> but<00:05:15.250> just<00:05:15.580> trace<00:05:16.449> it<00:05:16.479> out

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
how long to do it but just trace it out

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:25.339 
how long to do it but just trace it out
good

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:25.349 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:32.929 

like<00:05:26.039> so<00:05:26.399> oh<00:05:28.759> there<00:05:29.759> goes<00:05:29.939> the<00:05:30.149> frigerator

00:05:32.929 --> 00:05:32.939 
like so oh there goes the frigerator

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:35.650 
like so oh there goes the frigerator
things<00:05:33.509> kind<00:05:33.809> of<00:05:33.839> noisy

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.660 
things kind of noisy

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.570 
things kind of noisy
but<00:05:36.290> once<00:05:36.440> you<00:05:36.650> think<00:05:36.830> you<00:05:37.010> got<00:05:37.160> it<00:05:37.340> where<00:05:37.490> you

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
but once you think you got it where you

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.830 
but once you think you got it where you
want

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.830 

all<00:05:42.410> you<00:05:42.650> got<00:05:42.860> to<00:05:42.980> do

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:54.760 

is<00:05:47.840> taken<00:05:48.410> out<00:05:48.880> and<00:05:50.410> I<00:05:51.410> would<00:05:53.380> clean<00:05:54.380> up<00:05:54.560> your

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.770 
is taken out and I would clean up your

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.440 
is taken out and I would clean up your
like<00:05:55.220> I<00:05:55.340> said<00:05:55.520> if<00:05:55.610> it's<00:05:55.700> carbon

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:56.450 
like I said if it's carbon

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:00.550 
like I said if it's carbon
late<00:05:57.440> I'd<00:05:57.740> clean<00:05:58.010> it<00:05:58.130> up<00:05:58.250> right<00:05:58.460> away<00:05:59.560> even

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
late I'd clean it up right away even

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.350 
late I'd clean it up right away even
before<00:06:00.680> you<00:06:00.950> set<00:06:01.160> the<00:06:01.280> seat<00:06:01.490> of<00:06:01.610> seat<00:06:01.970> sheath

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
before you set the seat of seat sheath

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:09.220 
before you set the seat of seat sheath
aside<00:06:02.720> to<00:06:02.930> dry<00:06:03.080> and<00:06:07.750> you<00:06:08.750> know<00:06:08.840> if<00:06:08.960> you<00:06:09.050> put

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:09.230 
aside to dry and you know if you put

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.070 
aside to dry and you know if you put
tough<00:06:09.440> glide<00:06:09.710> or<00:06:09.920> something<00:06:10.360> on<00:06:11.360> a<00:06:11.420> knife<00:06:11.750> or

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 
tough glide or something on a knife or

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.840 
tough glide or something on a knife or
anything<00:06:12.140> to<00:06:12.470> protect<00:06:12.650> it<00:06:13.100> you<00:06:13.250> can<00:06:13.610> do<00:06:13.730> it

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:13.850 
anything to protect it you can do it

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:20.860 
anything to protect it you can do it
right<00:06:14.000> away<00:06:14.060> would<00:06:14.450> be<00:06:14.480> a<00:06:14.600> good<00:06:14.750> idea<00:06:19.630> and<00:06:20.630> we

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:20.870 
right away would be a good idea and we

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.040 
right away would be a good idea and we
can<00:06:21.020> take<00:06:21.170> the<00:06:21.320> Faro<00:06:21.560> right<00:06:21.860> out<00:06:22.070> now<00:06:22.960> so<00:06:23.960> you

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.050 
can take the Faro right out now so you

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.190 
can take the Faro right out now so you
can<00:06:24.260> see<00:06:24.940> that<00:06:25.940> it<00:06:26.030> holds<00:06:26.240> that<00:06:26.540> shape<00:06:26.870> pretty

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:27.200 
can see that it holds that shape pretty

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.830 
can see that it holds that shape pretty
well<00:06:27.410> and<00:06:27.820> now<00:06:28.820> all<00:06:29.120> we've<00:06:29.300> got<00:06:29.420> to<00:06:29.450> do<00:06:29.630> at<00:06:29.720> this

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 
well and now all we've got to do at this

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.450 
well and now all we've got to do at this
point<00:06:30.110> is<00:06:30.850> set<00:06:31.850> it<00:06:31.970> to<00:06:32.120> dry<00:06:32.530> for<00:06:33.530> a<00:06:33.560> couple<00:06:34.010> days

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460 
point is set it to dry for a couple days

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:39.820 
point is set it to dry for a couple days
I<00:06:34.990> usually<00:06:35.990> wait<00:06:36.320> three<00:06:36.740> to<00:06:37.730> three<00:06:38.180> days<00:06:38.830> just

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:39.830 
I usually wait three to three days just

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.410 
I usually wait three to three days just
to<00:06:39.920> be<00:06:40.010> sure<00:06:40.040> that<00:06:40.400> it's<00:06:40.550> totally<00:06:41.030> dry<00:06:41.180> because

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:41.420 
to be sure that it's totally dry because

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.640 
to be sure that it's totally dry because
you<00:06:41.570> want<00:06:41.720> to<00:06:41.750> make<00:06:41.900> sure<00:06:41.930> it's<00:06:42.170> totally<00:06:42.500> dry

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:42.650

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:44.630 
so I'm actually going to do this in a

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.730 
so I'm actually going to do this in a
couple<00:06:44.780> parts<00:06:47.140> well<00:06:48.140> I<00:06:48.200> guess<00:06:48.500> I<00:06:48.590> haven't

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:48.740 
couple parts well I guess I haven't

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.930 
couple parts well I guess I haven't
decided<00:06:49.010> I<00:06:49.280> may<00:06:49.430> put<00:06:49.670> it<00:06:49.760> up<00:06:49.880> all<00:06:50.060> as<00:06:50.180> one<00:06:51.910> or<00:06:52.910> I

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:52.940 
decided I may put it up all as one or I

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:58.540 
decided I may put it up all as one or I
may<00:06:53.060> do<00:06:53.240> it<00:06:53.330> in<00:06:53.420> a<00:06:53.510> cup<00:06:53.690> parts<00:06:54.820> so<00:06:57.370> but<00:06:58.370> this<00:06:58.490> is

00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:58.550 
may do it in a cup parts so but this is

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.720 
may do it in a cup parts so but this is
the<00:06:58.760> first<00:06:58.940> step<00:06:59.240> let<00:06:59.480> it<00:06:59.630> sit<00:06:59.840> and<00:06:59.870> dry<00:07:00.020> and

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:00.730 
the first step let it sit and dry and

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:03.640
