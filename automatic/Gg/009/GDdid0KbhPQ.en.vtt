today I'm getting ready to do a little

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.590 
today I'm getting ready to do a little
pruning<00:00:07.750> work<00:00:08.170> and<00:00:08.500> my<00:00:09.130> old<00:00:09.280> cherry<00:00:09.580> tree<00:00:09.879> this

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:10.600 
pruning work and my old cherry tree this

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.860 
pruning work and my old cherry tree this
tree<00:00:10.960> has<00:00:11.139> been<00:00:11.320> here<00:00:11.650> now<00:00:11.889> for<00:00:11.920> oh<00:00:12.630> say<00:00:13.630> about

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:13.870 
tree has been here now for oh say about

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.640 
tree has been here now for oh say about
fourteen<00:00:14.440> years<00:00:14.469> or<00:00:15.099> so<00:00:15.869> it<00:00:16.869> was<00:00:17.290> pruned

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:17.650 
fourteen years or so it was pruned

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.939 
fourteen years or so it was pruned
properly<00:00:18.400> in<00:00:18.580> its<00:00:18.790> youth<00:00:19.060> so<00:00:19.570> it<00:00:19.810> has<00:00:20.020> a<00:00:20.050> fairly

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:20.949 
properly in its youth so it has a fairly

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:23.970 
properly in its youth so it has a fairly
short<00:00:21.359> central<00:00:22.359> trunk<00:00:22.720> with<00:00:23.410> the<00:00:23.529> scaffold

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:23.980 
short central trunk with the scaffold

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.050 
short central trunk with the scaffold
branches<00:00:24.400> coming<00:00:24.699> out<00:00:25.000> the<00:00:25.840> tree<00:00:26.109> was<00:00:27.060> also

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.060 
branches coming out the tree was also

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.810 
branches coming out the tree was also
kept<00:00:28.660> open<00:00:29.380> in<00:00:29.590> the<00:00:29.949> center<00:00:30.250> of<00:00:30.310> the<00:00:30.430> canopy

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
kept open in the center of the canopy

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.240 
kept open in the center of the canopy
over<00:00:31.269> here<00:00:31.510> we<00:00:32.260> walked<00:00:32.529> to<00:00:32.680> the<00:00:32.769> middle<00:00:33.040> of<00:00:33.160> the

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
over here we walked to the middle of the

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.340 
over here we walked to the middle of the
tree<00:00:33.519> and<00:00:33.730> put<00:00:33.970> the<00:00:34.330> camera<00:00:34.510> straight<00:00:34.900> up<00:00:35.110> you

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
tree and put the camera straight up you

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.520 
tree and put the camera straight up you
see<00:00:35.500> mostly<00:00:35.920> sky<00:00:36.399> up<00:00:36.700> here<00:00:37.000> that's<00:00:37.989> proper

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
see mostly sky up here that's proper

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.190 
see mostly sky up here that's proper
formation<00:00:39.000> cherry<00:00:40.000> tree<00:00:40.329> should<00:00:40.630> look<00:00:40.899> pretty

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 
formation cherry tree should look pretty

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.920 
formation cherry tree should look pretty
much<00:00:41.380> like<00:00:41.440> a<00:00:41.710> wagon<00:00:42.040> wheel<00:00:42.460> from<00:00:42.820> above<00:00:43.149> but

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
much like a wagon wheel from above but

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.470 
much like a wagon wheel from above but
as<00:00:44.200> time<00:00:44.500> goes<00:00:44.530> on<00:00:45.040> we<00:00:45.399> do<00:00:45.579> start<00:00:45.910> to<00:00:46.030> get<00:00:46.180> a<00:00:46.210> few

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
as time goes on we do start to get a few

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.420 
as time goes on we do start to get a few
limbs<00:00:46.750> like<00:00:47.200> this<00:00:47.440> one<00:00:47.649> right<00:00:47.860> here

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
limbs like this one right here

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.090 
limbs like this one right here
that<00:00:49.030> head<00:00:49.270> way<00:00:49.719> up<00:00:49.750> into<00:00:50.289> outer<00:00:50.559> space<00:00:50.739> and

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
that head way up into outer space and

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.760 
that head way up into outer space and
it's<00:00:51.550> starting<00:00:52.000> to<00:00:52.120> get<00:00:52.270> a<00:00:52.329> bit<00:00:52.600> beyond<00:00:53.020> where

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
it's starting to get a bit beyond where

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.639 
it's starting to get a bit beyond where
I<00:00:53.800> can<00:00:54.160> pick<00:00:54.430> it<00:00:54.460> so<00:00:54.879> my<00:00:55.090> project<00:00:55.600> today<00:00:55.750> is<00:00:56.079> to

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
I can pick it so my project today is to

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:58.500 
I can pick it so my project today is to
go<00:00:56.829> up<00:00:57.010> and<00:00:57.250> just<00:00:57.430> address<00:00:57.820> a<00:00:57.850> few<00:00:58.270> of<00:00:58.390> those

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
go up and just address a few of those

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.569 
go up and just address a few of those
limbs<00:00:58.930> that<00:00:59.199> are<00:00:59.350> heading<00:00:59.620> way<00:00:59.920> up<00:01:00.250> into<00:01:00.460> the

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
limbs that are heading way up into the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
pruning in a cherry tree induces a lot

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.120 
pruning in a cherry tree induces a lot
of<00:01:29.619> new<00:01:29.920> growth<00:01:30.220> which<00:01:30.970> is<00:01:31.150> undesirable<00:01:32.130> after

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
of new growth which is undesirable after

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.100 
of new growth which is undesirable after
the<00:01:33.250> trees<00:01:33.520> are<00:01:33.759> 3<00:01:33.970> or<00:01:34.090> 4<00:01:34.119> years<00:01:34.509> old<00:01:34.750> we

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
the trees are 3 or 4 years old we

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.649 
the trees are 3 or 4 years old we
usually<00:01:35.590> try<00:01:35.860> not<00:01:36.130> to<00:01:36.400> prune<00:01:36.970> them<00:01:37.210> very<00:01:37.450> much

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
usually try not to prune them very much

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.050 
usually try not to prune them very much
at<00:01:37.900> all<00:01:38.079> oh<00:01:38.350> really<00:01:38.710> looking<00:01:39.220> at<00:01:39.369> here<00:01:39.640> is<00:01:39.880> say

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
at all oh really looking at here is say

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.179 
at all oh really looking at here is say
for<00:01:40.299> instance<00:01:40.390> this<00:01:40.810> branch<00:01:41.200> is<00:01:41.500> crossing

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
for instance this branch is crossing

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:44.370 
for instance this branch is crossing
it's<00:01:42.970> not<00:01:43.150> making<00:01:43.390> a<00:01:43.570> lot<00:01:43.720> of<00:01:43.750> sense<00:01:44.020> anymore

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
it's not making a lot of sense anymore

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.710 
it's not making a lot of sense anymore
and<00:01:44.829> so<00:01:45.220> I'm<00:01:45.310> looking<00:01:45.460> at<00:01:45.700> removing<00:01:46.210> a<00:01:46.329> few<00:01:46.600> of

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
and so I'm looking at removing a few of

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.139 
and so I'm looking at removing a few of
the<00:01:46.810> branches<00:01:47.380> that<00:01:47.590> are<00:01:47.649> either<00:01:48.159> poorly

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
the branches that are either poorly

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:51.780 
the branches that are either poorly
placed<00:01:49.479> or<00:01:49.869> I<00:01:50.380> have<00:01:50.590> a<00:01:50.649> few<00:01:51.009> in<00:01:51.189> the<00:01:51.310> top<00:01:51.520> of<00:01:51.700> the

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
placed or I have a few in the top of the

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.280 
placed or I have a few in the top of the
canopy<00:01:52.180> that<00:01:52.930> are<00:01:53.229> too<00:01:53.770> hot<00:01:53.979> and<00:01:54.810> so<00:01:55.810> we'll

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
canopy that are too hot and so we'll

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.319 
canopy that are too hot and so we'll
start<00:01:56.560> off<00:01:56.770> right<00:01:57.009> here<00:01:57.310> on<00:01:57.369> this<00:01:57.729> one<00:01:57.970> with

start off right here on this one with

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:00.840 
start off right here on this one with
the<00:01:58.509> lopper<00:01:58.899> I'm<00:01:59.079> just<00:01:59.829> going<00:02:00.040> to<00:02:00.100> shorten<00:02:00.759> it

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
the lopper I'm just going to shorten it

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.929 
the lopper I'm just going to shorten it
up<00:02:00.909> a<00:02:01.090> little<00:02:01.270> bit<00:02:01.450> like<00:02:01.689> that<00:02:01.990> then<00:02:02.860> switch<00:02:03.700> to

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
up a little bit like that then switch to

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.270 
up a little bit like that then switch to
my<00:02:04.090> handsaw

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
my handsaw

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.070 
my handsaw
come<00:02:06.610> right<00:02:06.850> in<00:02:06.880> here<00:02:07.479> and<00:02:07.690> I'm<00:02:07.840> going<00:02:07.990> to

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
the tree what I see over here is just a

the tree what I see over here is just a
whole<00:03:46.950> bunch<00:03:47.370> of<00:03:47.519> wood<00:03:47.760> that's<00:03:48.000> been<00:03:48.239> all

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
whole bunch of wood that's been all

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.170 
whole bunch of wood that's been all
ripped<00:03:49.019> up<00:03:49.260> partially<00:03:49.950> by<00:03:50.129> boring<00:03:50.670> insects

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
ripped up partially by boring insects

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.020 
ripped up partially by boring insects
and<00:03:51.450> then<00:03:52.109> again<00:03:52.409> partially<00:03:53.099> by<00:03:53.760> that

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
and then again partially by that

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.059 
and then again partially by that
woodpecker<00:03:54.239> who<00:03:54.810> went<00:03:55.019> in<00:03:55.200> after<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:55.769> boring

insects<00:03:56.489> doing<00:03:57.239> a<00:03:57.299> good<00:03:57.480> job<00:03:57.540> but<00:03:58.530> this<00:03:58.680> branch

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
insects doing a good job but this branch

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.369 
insects doing a good job but this branch
is<00:03:59.220> pretty<00:03:59.459> messed<00:03:59.700> up<00:03:59.909> and<00:04:00.209> I<00:04:00.989> think<00:04:01.260> I'm

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
is pretty messed up and I think I'm

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.039 
is pretty messed up and I think I'm
going<00:04:01.500> to<00:04:01.560> take<00:04:01.769> it<00:04:01.950> right<00:04:02.099> out<00:04:02.159> of<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.519> tree

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
going to take it right out of the tree

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:08.420 
going to take it right out of the tree
start<00:04:04.049> by<00:04:04.260> making<00:04:04.470> a<00:04:04.709> cut<00:04:04.920> right<00:04:05.159> here<00:04:07.430> there

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
start by making a cut right here there

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.349 
start by making a cut right here there
we<00:04:08.579> go<00:04:08.959> take<00:04:09.959> that<00:04:10.169> branch<00:04:10.500> off<00:04:11.180> there<00:04:12.180> on<00:04:12.329> the

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
we go take that branch off there on the

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:14.870 
we go take that branch off there on the
yard<00:04:12.630> now<00:04:13.380> I<00:04:13.709> think<00:04:14.040> I'm<00:04:14.220> going<00:04:14.340> to<00:04:14.400> come<00:04:14.669> down

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
yard now I think I'm going to come down

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.810 
yard now I think I'm going to come down
here<00:04:15.329> to<00:04:15.989> a<00:04:16.019> suitable<00:04:16.530> alternate<00:04:17.280> right<00:04:17.489> here

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
here to a suitable alternate right here

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.659 
here to a suitable alternate right here
looks<00:04:18.060> good<00:04:18.150> to<00:04:18.510> me<00:04:18.620> and<00:04:19.620> so<00:04:19.919> I'm<00:04:20.220> going<00:04:20.370> to<00:04:20.430> saw

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
looks good to me and so I'm going to saw

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:25.250 
looks good to me and so I'm going to saw
that<00:04:20.910> limb<00:04:21.209> off<00:04:21.450> just<00:04:21.750> above<00:04:22.109> this<00:04:24.260> horizontal

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
that limb off just above this horizontal

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.629 
that limb off just above this horizontal
limb<00:04:25.440> here<00:04:26.570> and<00:04:27.590> keep<00:04:28.590> the<00:04:28.800> limb<00:04:29.010> around<00:04:29.340> for<00:04:29.610> a

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
limb here and keep the limb around for a

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:34.400 
limb here and keep the limb around for a
while<00:04:29.820> yet<00:04:30.590> fruit<00:04:31.590> it<00:04:32.360> off<00:04:33.360> the<00:04:33.720> small<00:04:34.080> side

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
while yet fruit it off the small side

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.089 
while yet fruit it off the small side
 there<00:04:34.979> we<00:04:35.039> go<00:04:35.479> you<00:04:36.479> can<00:04:36.539> see<00:04:36.750> here<00:04:37.500> the

00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:38.099 
 there we go you can see here the

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:40.610 
 there we go you can see here the
kind<00:04:38.310> of<00:04:38.490> damage<00:04:38.729> that<00:04:39.270> I<00:04:39.510> found<00:04:40.139> up<00:04:40.380> in<00:04:40.500> the

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
kind of damage that I found up in the

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.219 
kind of damage that I found up in the
top<00:04:40.830> of<00:04:41.039> that<00:04:41.130> tree<00:04:41.539> this<00:04:42.539> would<00:04:42.750> be<00:04:42.900> one<00:04:43.110> of

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
top of that tree this would be one of

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:44.779 
top of that tree this would be one of
the<00:04:43.289> reasons<00:04:43.470> that<00:04:43.889> we<00:04:44.010> might<00:04:44.039> get<00:04:44.460> into<00:04:44.760> a

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
the reasons that we might get into a

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:48.260 
the reasons that we might get into a
cherry<00:04:45.180> tree<00:04:45.510> and<00:04:45.710> start<00:04:46.710> pruning<00:04:47.130> away<00:04:47.270> even

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
cherry tree and start pruning away even

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.810 
cherry tree and start pruning away even
on<00:04:48.419> the<00:04:48.599> older<00:04:48.990> trees<00:04:49.349> because<00:04:50.220> just<00:04:50.460> isn't<00:04:50.789> a

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
on the older trees because just isn't a

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.730 
on the older trees because just isn't a
good<00:04:50.849> idea<00:04:51.060> to<00:04:51.599> leave<00:04:51.750> this<00:04:51.960> kind<00:04:52.260> of<00:04:52.380> wood<00:04:52.560> up

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
good idea to leave this kind of wood up

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.670 
good idea to leave this kind of wood up
there<00:04:52.949> it<00:04:53.099> may<00:04:53.280> still<00:04:53.580> have<00:04:53.789> insects<00:04:54.330> in<00:04:54.599> it

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
there it may still have insects in it

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.540 
there it may still have insects in it
it's<00:04:55.680> probably<00:04:56.039> not<00:04:56.130> going<00:04:56.280> to<00:04:56.340> produce

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
it's probably not going to produce

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:04.750 
it's probably not going to produce
properly<00:04:57.539> and<00:04:57.900> it<00:04:58.139> may<00:04:58.349> begin<00:04:58.560> to<00:04:58.770> rot

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.560 

well<00:05:05.760> it<00:05:05.880> looks<00:05:06.060> like<00:05:06.150> our<00:05:06.420> Goldfinch<00:05:07.020> degrees

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
well it looks like our Goldfinch degrees

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.630 
well it looks like our Goldfinch degrees
the<00:05:09.570> pruning<00:05:09.840> job<00:05:10.200> here<00:05:10.500> in<00:05:10.680> the<00:05:10.800> in<00:05:10.980> the

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
the pruning job here in the in the

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.070 
the pruning job here in the in the
cherry<00:05:11.940> tree<00:05:12.240> is<00:05:12.750> bought<00:05:13.710> over<00:05:14.480> he<00:05:15.480> dropped<00:05:15.810> in

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
cherry tree is bought over he dropped in

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:22.160 
cherry tree is bought over he dropped in
and<00:05:16.290> said<00:05:16.820> quit<00:05:17.850> I<00:05:18.120> need<00:05:18.780> a<00:05:18.810> perch<00:05:19.490> so<00:05:20.490> I<00:05:21.170> think

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.170 
and said quit I need a perch so I think

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:23.660 
and said quit I need a perch so I think
we<00:05:22.380> got<00:05:22.500> the<00:05:22.680> center<00:05:22.980> of<00:05:23.070> the<00:05:23.160> tree<00:05:23.430> pretty

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:23.670 
we got the center of the tree pretty

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:28.250 
we got the center of the tree pretty
well<00:05:23.910> opened<00:05:24.420> up<00:05:24.570> from<00:05:24.840> here<00:05:25.230> and<00:05:26.840> got<00:05:27.840> most<00:05:28.050> of

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
well opened up from here and got most of

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.220 
well opened up from here and got most of
the<00:05:28.380> high<00:05:28.560> wood<00:05:28.890> out<00:05:29.130> of<00:05:29.160> the<00:05:29.280> canopy<00:05:29.900> and<00:05:30.900> I

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.230

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.280 
the high wood out of the canopy and I
removed<00:05:31.620> all<00:05:32.220> the<00:05:32.550> insect<00:05:33.210> damage<00:05:33.450> I<00:05:33.780> found<00:05:34.050> up

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:39.400 
removed all the insect damage I found up
there<00:05:34.320> I<00:05:35.990> should<00:05:36.990> do<00:05:37.200> it<00:05:37.350> for<00:05:37.590> this<00:05:37.710> year
