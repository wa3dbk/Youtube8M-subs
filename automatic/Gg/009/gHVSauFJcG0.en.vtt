it'll be easier to show and pretty much

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.960

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
you have to get up here and go all the

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.020 
you have to get up here and go all the
way<00:01:30.360> up<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.899> top<00:01:31.340> pretty<00:01:32.340> much<00:01:32.549> where<00:01:32.820> the

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
way up to the top pretty much where the

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.960 
way up to the top pretty much where the
notched<00:01:33.240> pickaxes<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.580> that<00:01:35.580> is<00:01:35.729> probably

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
notched pickaxes and that is probably

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.310 
notched pickaxes and that is probably
still<00:01:36.119> up<00:01:36.270> here<00:01:36.390> because<00:01:36.539> I<00:01:36.720> left<00:01:36.899> it<00:01:37.049> up<00:01:37.140> here

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
still up here because I left it up here

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.100 
still up here because I left it up here
because<00:01:37.440> it<00:01:37.710> made<00:01:37.890> me<00:01:37.920> too<00:01:38.310> encumbered<00:01:39.210> to

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
because it made me too encumbered to

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.309 
because it made me too encumbered to
hold<00:01:44.030> so<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.119> notched<00:01:45.360> pickaxe<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:46.020> here

00:01:46.309 --> 00:01:46.319 
hold so the notched pickaxe is here

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:48.859 
hold so the notched pickaxe is here
after<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:47.700> don't<00:01:48.090> know<00:01:48.179> where<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.420> now<00:01:48.479> cuz<00:01:48.840> I

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
after I don't know where it is now cuz I

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.010

or<00:02:11.329> smithing<00:02:12.329> these<00:02:12.480> and<00:02:12.750> there<00:02:13.320> are<00:02:13.410> two

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
or smithing these and there are two

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.160 
or smithing these and there are two
different<00:02:13.799> ways<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:14.420> to<00:02:15.420> craft<00:02:15.690> them<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.140> I

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
different ways to to craft them and I

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.930 
different ways to to craft them and I
like<00:02:16.350> this<00:02:16.530> version<00:02:16.739> better<00:02:17.040> because<00:02:17.579> it's

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
like this version better because it's

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.580 
like this version better because it's
easier<00:02:18.239> so<00:02:18.840> we're<00:02:18.930> gonna<00:02:19.019> craft<00:02:19.350> that<00:02:19.530> and

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
easier so we're gonna craft that and

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.319 
easier so we're gonna craft that and
it's<00:02:22.590> been<00:02:22.739> added<00:02:23.100> we're<00:02:23.519> gonna<00:02:23.609> go<00:02:23.790> see<00:02:24.030> if<00:02:24.150> it

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
it's been added we're gonna go see if it

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:27.440 
it's been added we're gonna go see if it
can<00:02:24.450> be<00:02:25.340> someone<00:02:26.340> who<00:02:26.489> can<00:02:26.640> get<00:02:26.850> used<00:02:27.239> in<00:02:27.359> the

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
can be someone who can get used in the

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.059 
can be someone who can get used in the
grindstone

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.339 

can<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:30.940> it<00:02:31.030> requires<00:02:31.420> to<00:02:31.720> stealing<00:02:32.140> let's

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
can and it requires to stealing let's

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.020 
can and it requires to stealing let's
I'll<00:02:32.950> steal<00:02:33.340> England's

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
I'll steal England's

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.780 
I'll steal England's
well<00:02:34.690> once<00:02:35.140> it's<00:02:35.319> done<00:02:35.590> that<00:02:35.860> it<00:02:36.489> will<00:02:36.549> be<00:02:36.640> like

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
well once it's done that it will be like

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.970 
well once it's done that it will be like
that<00:02:36.970> and<00:02:37.120> if<00:02:37.239> you<00:02:37.360> use<00:02:37.510> a<00:02:37.980> blacksmithing

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
that and if you use a blacksmithing

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.580 
that and if you use a blacksmithing
elixir<00:02:39.849> it'll<00:02:40.090> be<00:02:40.150> more<00:02:40.330> powerful<00:02:40.629> so<00:02:41.440> let's

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
elixir it'll be more powerful so let's

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:48.780 
elixir it'll be more powerful so let's
check<00:02:41.830> it<00:02:41.950> out<00:02:42.040> and<00:02:42.099> see<00:02:42.430> how<00:02:42.519> it<00:02:42.549> looks

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.240 

it's<00:02:49.300> a<00:02:49.420> two-handed<00:02:49.900> weapon<00:02:50.200> maybe<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:51.099> other

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
it's a two-handed weapon maybe the other

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.089 
it's a two-handed weapon maybe the other
one<00:02:51.459> is<00:02:51.580> a<00:02:51.610> one-handed<00:02:52.590> probably<00:02:53.590> is<00:02:56.040> it's<00:02:57.040> a

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
one is a one-handed probably is it's a

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:59.160 
one is a one-handed probably is it's a
pretty<00:02:57.280> good<00:02:57.519> looking<00:02:57.760> sword<00:02:58.209> it<00:02:58.480> may<00:02:58.780> be<00:02:58.840> I

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
pretty good looking sword it may be I

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.580 
pretty good looking sword it may be I
feel<00:02:59.680> like<00:02:59.739> it's<00:02:59.980> too<00:03:00.159> short<00:03:00.489> to<00:03:01.330> be<00:03:01.510> a

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
feel like it's too short to be a

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.650 
feel like it's too short to be a
two-handed<00:03:02.590> weapon<00:03:03.780> but<00:03:06.150> you<00:03:07.150> save<00:03:07.420> really

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
two-handed weapon but you save really

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.740 
two-handed weapon but you save really
quick<00:03:08.670> you<00:03:09.670> can<00:03:09.819> just<00:03:09.970> go<00:03:10.090> try<00:03:10.299> to<00:03:10.330> kill<00:03:10.599> this

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
quick you can just go try to kill this

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:17.280 
quick you can just go try to kill this
guy<00:03:11.430> wait<00:03:15.209> it's<00:03:16.209> not<00:03:16.269> super<00:03:16.720> powerful<00:03:16.989> because

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
guy wait it's not super powerful because

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.960 
guy wait it's not super powerful because
it<00:03:17.379> hasn't<00:03:17.530> been<00:03:17.620> upgraded<00:03:18.129> I<00:03:18.489> don't<00:03:18.790> have<00:03:18.940> a

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
it hasn't been upgraded I don't have a

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:28.860 
it hasn't been upgraded I don't have a
very<00:03:19.150> high<00:03:19.269> two-handed

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.130 

so<00:03:29.870> yeah<00:03:30.580> just<00:03:31.580> go<00:03:31.760> back<00:03:31.940> to<00:03:31.970> that<00:03:32.210> other<00:03:32.810> safe

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
so yeah just go back to that other safe

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.700 
so yeah just go back to that other safe
okay

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:33.710 
okay

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.750 
okay
so<00:03:34.990> that's<00:03:35.990> pretty<00:03:36.410> much<00:03:36.620> all<00:03:36.890> there<00:03:37.190> is<00:03:37.220> for

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
so that's pretty much all there is for

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.890 
so that's pretty much all there is for
the<00:03:38.170> blade's<00:03:39.170> vampire<00:03:40.130> sword

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
alright guys from the next mine is

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.050 
alright guys from the next mine is
probably<00:03:43.190> my<00:03:43.280> favorite<00:03:43.640> out<00:03:43.670> of<00:03:43.760> all<00:03:43.910> these

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
probably my favorite out of all these

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.500 
probably my favorite out of all these
it's<00:03:44.270> the<00:03:44.360> throwing<00:03:44.660> weapons<00:03:44.959> redux<00:03:45.350> by

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
it's the throwing weapons redux by

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.000 
it's the throwing weapons redux by
Julius<00:03:47.510> I'm<00:03:47.870> not<00:03:48.200> sure<00:03:48.410> if<00:03:48.500> I<00:03:48.590> pronounced<00:03:48.890> that

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
Julius I'm not sure if I pronounced that

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.030 
Julius I'm not sure if I pronounced that
right<00:03:49.160> but<00:03:49.750> so<00:03:50.750> pretty<00:03:51.050> much<00:03:51.170> it<00:03:51.320> does<00:03:51.800> what<00:03:51.950> it

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
right but so pretty much it does what it

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.280 
right but so pretty much it does what it
says<00:03:52.070> it<00:03:52.400> adds<00:03:52.580> throwing<00:03:53.090> weapons<00:03:53.360> to<00:03:53.540> the

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
game and it has them and pretty much all

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.580 
game and it has them and pretty much all
of<00:03:58.730> the<00:03:58.910> different<00:04:01.720> crafting<00:04:02.720> think<00:04:02.959> crafting

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
of the different crafting think crafting

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:09.840 
of the different crafting think crafting

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
smithing different like metals and stuff

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:15.040 
smithing different like metals and stuff
so<00:04:10.850> here's<00:04:11.840> the<00:04:12.080> channel<00:04:12.590> for<00:04:12.709> that<00:04:14.050> throwing

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
so here's the channel for that throwing

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.940 
so here's the channel for that throwing
action<00:04:15.260> knife<00:04:15.620> and<00:04:16.040> then<00:04:17.500> there's<00:04:18.500> the<00:04:18.680> dragon

these because they're decently hard to

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.600 
these because they're decently hard to
make<00:04:42.389> but<00:04:42.569> I<00:04:42.599> will<00:04:42.840> show<00:04:43.400> throwing<00:04:44.400> some<00:04:44.580> of
