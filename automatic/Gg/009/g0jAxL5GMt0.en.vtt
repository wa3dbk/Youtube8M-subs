but<00:01:22.110> anyhow<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:23.270> and<00:01:24.270> then<00:01:24.860> the<00:01:25.860> inside<00:01:26.189> are

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460

just<00:01:26.759> little<00:01:26.970> chipboard<00:01:27.509> pages<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.229> a

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
just little chipboard pages this is a

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.600
