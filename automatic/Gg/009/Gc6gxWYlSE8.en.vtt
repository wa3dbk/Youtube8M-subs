00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
off the field in my life so you know

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.450 
off the field in my life so you know

and<00:04:36.620> you<00:04:37.620> know<00:04:37.710> you<00:04:37.830> got<00:04:37.950> to<00:04:38.040> set<00:04:38.190> that<00:04:38.310> tone

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
and you know you got to set that tone

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.670 
and you know you got to set that tone
early<00:04:38.790> so<00:04:39.120> it's<00:04:39.540> a<00:04:39.630> positive<00:04:39.840> thing<00:04:40.350> to<00:04:40.380> have<00:04:40.650> a

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
early so it's a positive thing to have a

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.530 
early so it's a positive thing to have a
lot<00:04:40.830> of<00:04:40.920> people<00:04:41.130> out<00:04:41.190> there<00:04:41.250> helping<00:04:41.700> but<00:04:42.390> it's

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
lot of people out there helping but it's

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.810 
lot of people out there helping but it's
also<00:04:42.720> can<00:04:43.080> be<00:04:43.200> a<00:04:43.230> negative<00:04:43.800> thing<00:04:43.980> if<00:04:44.250> you<00:04:44.430> let

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
also can be a negative thing if you let

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.640 
also can be a negative thing if you let
them<00:04:44.970> get<00:04:45.630> out<00:04:45.660> there<00:04:45.990> and<00:04:46.200> do<00:04:46.380> the<00:04:46.500> wrong

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650

Dave<00:05:30.870> credit<00:05:31.260> for<00:05:31.410> this<00:05:31.530> and<00:05:31.740> maybe<00:05:32.520> he<00:05:32.700> picked

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
Dave credit for this and maybe he picked

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.250
