think it's set in stone and that's the

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.570 
think it's set in stone and that's the
point<00:02:25.900> of<00:02:26.080> being<00:02:26.140> a<00:02:26.410> living<00:02:26.709> choreographer<00:02:27.430> is

the<00:02:39.280> piece<00:02:39.519> is<00:02:39.790> still<00:02:40.150> what<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:40.930> pieces<00:02:41.410> and

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
the piece is still what the pieces and

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.339 
the piece is still what the pieces and
the<00:02:42.129> work<00:02:42.370> still<00:02:42.849> communicates<00:02:43.629> the<00:02:43.780> music

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
the work still communicates the music

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.789 
the work still communicates the music
and<00:02:44.590> explores<00:02:46.379> especially<00:02:47.379> in<00:02:47.440> that<00:02:47.560> middle

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
and explores especially in that middle

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.099 
and explores especially in that middle
section<00:02:48.099> which<00:02:48.760> is<00:02:48.940> a<00:02:48.970> long<00:02:49.299> duetted<00:02:49.930> it

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
section which is a long duetted it

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:53.460 
section which is a long duetted it
explores<00:02:50.829> the<00:02:51.340> role<00:02:51.940> of<00:02:51.970> this<00:02:52.359> female<00:02:52.870> dancer

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
explores the role of this female dancer

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.920 
explores the role of this female dancer
sort<00:02:53.950> of<00:02:54.040> her<00:02:54.220> emotions<00:02:54.730> soaring<00:02:55.420> over<00:02:55.690> time

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
sort of her emotions soaring over time

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.259 
sort of her emotions soaring over time
so<00:02:56.440> I<00:02:56.650> mean<00:02:57.310> the<00:02:57.430> fact<00:02:57.579> that<00:02:57.730> she<00:02:57.910> does<00:02:58.060> on<00:02:58.239> a

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
so I mean the fact that she does on a

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.030 
so I mean the fact that she does on a
left<00:02:58.569> leg<00:02:58.750> all<00:02:58.900> right<00:02:59.140> like<00:02:59.379> I<00:02:59.500> don't<00:02:59.739> think

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
left leg all right like I don't think

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.910 
left leg all right like I don't think
really<00:03:00.250> changes<00:03:00.910> her<00:03:01.359> emotions<00:03:01.900> thorns<00:03:02.440> what

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
really changes her emotions thorns what

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.660

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:17.919 
can't remember when so sort of normally

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:20.879 
can't remember when so sort of normally
every<00:03:18.160> three<00:03:18.489> years<00:03:18.730> it<00:03:19.030> gets<00:03:19.180> done<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:20.680> it's

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
every three years it gets done and it's

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:22.650 
every three years it gets done and it's
a<00:03:21.010> useful<00:03:21.250> work<00:03:21.609> for<00:03:21.639> a<00:03:21.910> company<00:03:22.090> because<00:03:22.630> it

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
a useful work for a company because it

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.509 
a useful work for a company because it
was<00:03:22.930> originally<00:03:23.440> conceived<00:03:23.889> for<00:03:24.040> very<00:03:24.370> small

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
was originally conceived for very small

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.849 
was originally conceived for very small
stages<00:03:25.060> and<00:03:25.660> so<00:03:25.750> is<00:03:25.900> easy<00:03:26.139> to<00:03:26.410> expand

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
stages and so is easy to expand

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.039 
stages and so is easy to expand
something<00:03:27.430> and<00:03:27.609> to<00:03:27.730> bring<00:03:27.940> it<00:03:28.060> back<00:03:28.209> down<00:03:28.389> so<00:03:28.810> I

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
something and to bring it back down so I

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.129 
something and to bring it back down so I
think<00:03:29.470> it's<00:03:29.799> a<00:03:29.980> really<00:03:30.419> good<00:03:31.419> choice<00:03:31.720> from

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
think it's a really good choice from

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:35.400 
think it's a really good choice from
David<00:03:33.010> to<00:03:33.430> for<00:03:34.269> this<00:03:34.389> company<00:03:34.840> but<00:03:35.109> it's<00:03:35.290> the

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
David to for this company but it's the

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.289 
David to for this company but it's the
right<00:03:35.590> size<00:03:35.620> it's<00:03:36.280> the<00:03:36.370> right<00:03:36.519> scale<00:03:36.849> of<00:03:37.090> work

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
right size it's the right scale of work

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.690 
right size it's the right scale of work
and<00:03:37.630> it'll<00:03:38.410> it'll<00:03:38.829> work<00:03:39.069> very<00:03:39.280> well<00:03:39.370> in<00:03:39.579> that

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
and it'll it'll work very well in that

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.210 
and it'll it'll work very well in that
theater<00:03:40.150> downstairs<00:03:40.530> well<00:03:41.530> I<00:03:41.709> think<00:03:41.859> what's

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
theater downstairs well I think what's

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.400 
theater downstairs well I think what's
been<00:03:42.370> interesting<00:03:42.669> restaging<00:03:43.599> this<00:03:43.959> work<00:03:44.169> for

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410
