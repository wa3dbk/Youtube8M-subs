number board patterning is a very
essential<00:00:22.199> concept<00:00:22.859> that<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.220> kids<00:00:23.490> have<00:00:23.669> to

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
essential concept that the kids have to

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.339 
essential concept that the kids have to
learn<00:00:23.910> by<00:00:24.119> putting<00:00:24.599> chips<00:00:24.810> on<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.109> board

we have 22 24 26 28 and 30 and what
happens<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.829> if<00:00:50.010> we<00:00:50.129> continue<00:00:50.579> this<00:00:50.699> pattern

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
happens is if we continue this pattern

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.540 
happens is if we continue this pattern
it<00:00:51.420> grows<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.410> end<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.769> board<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.250> we

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
it grows to the end of the board and we

multiples of 2 the second multiple we're
going<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.280> look<00:00:59.579> at<00:00:59.760> are<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.929> multiples<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.530> 3

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
going to look at are the multiples of 3

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.030 
going to look at are the multiples of 3
which<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.149> pattern<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.660> threes<00:01:04.040> we're

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
which is the pattern of threes we're

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.440 
which is the pattern of threes we're
going<00:01:05.130> to<00:01:05.190> change<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.610> color<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.060> we're

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
going to change the color and we're

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.910 
going to change the color and we're
going<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.630> do<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.900> threes<00:01:09.410> the<00:01:10.410> multiples<00:01:10.830> of

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.970 
going to do the threes the multiples of
3<00:01:11.330> follow<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.540> different<00:01:12.750> type<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.140> pattern<00:01:13.440> the

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:13.980 
3 follow a different type of pattern the

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.650 
3 follow a different type of pattern the
first<00:01:14.220> pattern<00:01:14.400> was<00:01:14.700> straight<00:01:15.360> up<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.600> down

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 
first pattern was straight up and down

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:16.820 
first pattern was straight up and down
this<00:01:15.930> pattern<00:01:16.290> will<00:01:16.320> be<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> little<00:01:16.740> different

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
this pattern will be a little different

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:28.430 
this pattern will be a little different
we<00:01:17.460> have<00:01:17.490> 3<00:01:17.960> 6<00:01:18.960> 9<00:01:19.310> 12<00:01:21.140> 15<00:01:22.140> 18<00:01:24.260> 21<00:01:25.580> 24<00:01:26.600> 27<00:01:27.600> as<00:01:27.900> the

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
we have 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 as the

we have 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 as the
kids<00:01:28.680> fill<00:01:29.280> out<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.640> pattern<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.390> pad

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
kids fill out this pattern the pad

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.290 
kids fill out this pattern the pad
pattern<00:01:31.110> changes<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:32.100> direction<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:33.150> the

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
pattern changes the direction so the

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.880 
pattern changes the direction so the
pattern<00:01:33.600> for<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.840> threes<00:01:34.080> is<00:01:34.290> much<00:01:34.470> different

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
pattern for the threes is much different

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.530 
pattern for the threes is much different
than<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.070> pattern<00:01:35.340> for<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.610> force<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.300> kids

than the pattern for the force the kids

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.110 
than the pattern for the force the kids
begin<00:01:37.050> to<00:01:37.230> realize<00:01:38.070> this<00:01:38.280> by<00:01:38.460> doing<00:01:38.520> the

five<00:02:15.230> so<00:02:15.500> we<00:02:15.620> have<00:02:15.739> 5<00:02:16.359> 10<00:02:17.379> 15<00:02:18.379> 20<00:02:19.090> 25<00:02:20.090> 30<00:02:21.310> 35<00:02:22.310> 40

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
five so we have 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:29.500 
five so we have 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40
45<00:02:24.739> 50<00:02:25.700> and<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.659> pattern<00:02:27.109> of<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:27.430> fives<00:02:28.430> is<00:02:28.760> go

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
45 50 and the pattern of the fives is go

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.720 
45 50 and the pattern of the fives is go
straight<00:02:29.569> down<00:02:29.870> to<00:02:30.560> separate<00:02:30.950> rows<00:02:31.099> the<00:02:31.310> fibro

straight down to separate rows the fibro

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.619 
straight down to separate rows the fibro

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:35.629 
and the ten room the next pattern would

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:39.490 
and the ten room the next pattern would
be<00:02:35.689> the<00:02:35.900> sixes<00:02:37.840> we'll<00:02:38.840> take<00:02:38.989> some<00:02:39.200> different

chips and we'll cover the sixes we have

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:47.500

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:53.689 
inside the box matches the purple six so

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:55.869

which<00:04:30.200> cover<00:04:31.070> the<00:04:31.190> board<00:04:31.520> going<00:04:31.820> straight

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
which cover the board going straight

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:38.370 
which cover the board going straight
down<00:04:32.090> from<00:04:32.750> the<00:04:32.900> multiple<00:04:33.050> of<00:04:33.680> 10<00:04:33.920> 20<00:04:34.910> 30<00:04:35.710> 40<00:04:36.760> 50

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
down from the multiple of 10 20 30 40 50

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.060 
down from the multiple of 10 20 30 40 50

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
60 70 80 90 100 and that brings us to

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.010 
60 70 80 90 100 and that brings us to
the<00:04:43.160> end<00:04:43.190> of<00:04:43.640> the<00:04:43.760> patterning<00:04:44.240> an<00:04:44.480> important

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
the end of the patterning an important

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.560 
the end of the patterning an important
thing<00:04:45.140> to<00:04:45.170> do<00:04:45.410> with<00:04:45.800> the<00:04:46.010> patterning<00:04:46.700> is<00:04:46.850> to

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
thing to do with the patterning is to

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.770 
thing to do with the patterning is to
have<00:04:48.350> the<00:04:48.530> students<00:04:48.890> color<00:04:49.400> in<00:04:49.670> the<00:04:50.120> activity

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
have the students color in the activity

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.710 
have the students color in the activity
what<00:04:51.500> we<00:04:51.620> do<00:04:51.770> is<00:04:52.040> first<00:04:52.670> after<00:04:53.120> the<00:04:53.240> students

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
what we do is first after the students

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.360 
what we do is first after the students
have<00:04:53.780> put<00:04:54.140> the<00:04:54.230> chips<00:04:54.470> on<00:04:54.620> the<00:04:54.710> board<00:04:54.920> you<00:04:55.340> can

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
have put the chips on the board you can

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.610 
have put the chips on the board you can
take<00:04:55.610> your<00:04:55.790> black<00:04:56.000> line<00:04:56.030> master<00:04:56.720> make<00:04:57.230> copies

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
take your black line master make copies

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.590 
take your black line master make copies
of<00:04:57.650> that<00:04:57.920> and<00:04:58.190> have<00:04:58.550> the<00:04:58.700> students<00:04:59.060> color<00:04:59.360> in

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
of that and have the students color in

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.110 
of that and have the students color in
the<00:05:00.080> pattern<00:05:00.560> that<00:05:00.740> matches<00:05:00.980> the<00:05:01.310> color<00:05:01.490> for

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
the pattern that matches the color for

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.050 
the pattern that matches the color for
example<00:05:02.450> the<00:05:02.540> first<00:05:03.670> multiples<00:05:04.670> that<00:05:04.820> we<00:05:04.910> did

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
example the first multiples that we did

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.120 
example the first multiples that we did
where<00:05:05.210> the<00:05:05.300> multiples<00:05:05.690> of<00:05:05.780> twos<00:05:06.020> and<00:05:06.380> here's<00:05:07.070> a

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
where the multiples of twos and here's a

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.740 
where the multiples of twos and here's a
black<00:05:07.370> line<00:05:07.580> master<00:05:08.030> and<00:05:08.240> if<00:05:08.420> you<00:05:08.510> call<00:05:08.690> the

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
black line master and if you call the

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.710 
black line master and if you call the
twos<00:05:09.110> in<00:05:09.290> blue<00:05:09.530> we<00:05:09.980> end<00:05:10.160> up<00:05:10.340> with<00:05:10.760> a<00:05:11.030> pattern<00:05:11.540> of

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
twos in blue we end up with a pattern of

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.990 
twos in blue we end up with a pattern of
the<00:05:11.870> tubes<00:05:12.080> and<00:05:12.440> what<00:05:12.980> I<00:05:13.010> did<00:05:13.340> in<00:05:13.430> the<00:05:13.520> past<00:05:13.700> has

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
the tubes and what I did in the past has

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.060 
the tubes and what I did in the past has
had<00:05:14.150> all<00:05:14.330> of<00:05:14.360> my<00:05:14.600> kids<00:05:14.900> coloring<00:05:15.800> all<00:05:15.950> the

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
had all of my kids coloring all the

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.190 
had all of my kids coloring all the
patterns<00:05:16.490> keep<00:05:16.940> this<00:05:17.090> in<00:05:17.150> a<00:05:17.300> notebook<00:05:17.570> so<00:05:18.140> you

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.200 
patterns keep this in a notebook so you

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.660 
patterns keep this in a notebook so you
have<00:05:18.380> a<00:05:18.410> reference<00:05:18.830> of<00:05:19.040> all<00:05:19.280> the<00:05:19.400> multiples

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:19.670 
have a reference of all the multiples

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:22.000 
have a reference of all the multiples
and<00:05:20.060> it<00:05:20.600> gives<00:05:20.780> you<00:05:20.900> a<00:05:20.930> good<00:05:21.350> idea<00:05:21.410> of<00:05:21.800> the

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010 
and it gives you a good idea of the

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.520 
and it gives you a good idea of the
multiples<00:05:22.850> of<00:05:23.030> different<00:05:23.480> different<00:05:24.170> numbers

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
multiples of different different numbers

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.210 
multiples of different different numbers
from<00:05:25.070> 2<00:05:25.670> through<00:05:26.180> 10
