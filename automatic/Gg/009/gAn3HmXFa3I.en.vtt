00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.169 
kill you KD a little bit I don't think
you<00:02:06.540> could<00:02:06.720> die<00:02:06.869> too<00:02:06.930> much<00:02:07.940> seeing<00:02:08.940> how<00:02:09.119> you

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
you could die too much seeing how you

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.420 
you could die too much seeing how you
know<00:02:09.539> unless<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:10.069> because<00:02:11.069> usually<00:02:11.250> people

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
know unless the because usually people

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.130 
know unless the because usually people
camp<00:02:11.910> in<00:02:12.090> effect<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:12.630> they<00:02:12.690> don't<00:02:12.810> really<00:02:13.020> I

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
camp in effect and they don't really I

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.270 
camp in effect and they don't really I
go<00:02:13.380> out<00:02:13.560> and<00:02:13.590> search

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
go out and search

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.140 
go out and search
for<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:15.209> infected<00:02:15.810> people<00:02:16.550> but<00:02:17.550> so<00:02:18.120> the

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
for the the infected people but so the

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.059 
for the the infected people but so the
most<00:02:18.569> i<00:02:18.780> don't<00:02:18.959> see<00:02:19.140> you<00:02:19.200> down<00:02:19.380> too<00:02:19.650> much<00:02:19.800> per

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
most i don't see you down too much per

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.100 
most i don't see you down too much per
game<00:02:20.310> so<00:02:20.819> I<00:02:20.850> don't<00:02:21.120> see<00:02:21.270> it<00:02:21.300> you<00:02:21.569> know<00:02:21.690> changing

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
game so I don't see it you know changing

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.600 
game so I don't see it you know changing
too<00:02:22.290> much<00:02:22.470> if<00:02:22.680> you<00:02:22.860> already<00:02:23.040> have<00:02:23.310> a<00:02:23.340> decent

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
too much if you already have a decent

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.370 
too much if you already have a decent
Katie<00:02:23.940> if<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:24.180> already<00:02:24.300> had<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:24.510> bad<00:02:24.750> one<00:02:25.020> and<00:02:25.170> I

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
Katie if you already had a bad one and I

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.280 
Katie if you already had a bad one and I
guess<00:02:25.590> it<00:02:26.220> doesn't<00:02:26.880> really<00:02:27.060> matter<00:02:27.360> but<00:02:28.110> like

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
guess it doesn't really matter but like

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.520 
guess it doesn't really matter but like
I<00:02:28.410> said<00:02:28.470> 30<00:02:29.510> 360,000<00:02:30.510> XP<00:02:30.870> overnight<00:02:31.380> without

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.949 
even plan that's a lot of XP and I'm not
sure<00:02:35.370> though<00:02:35.670> how<00:02:35.850> much<00:02:36.060> that<00:02:36.270> you<00:02:36.420> take<00:02:36.600> spur

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
sure though how much that you take spur

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.340 
sure though how much that you take spur
prestige<00:02:37.440> but<00:02:38.430> either<00:02:38.580> way<00:02:38.880> if<00:02:39.720> it's<00:02:39.989> you<00:02:40.200> know

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
prestige but either way if it's you know

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.380 
prestige but either way if it's you know
it's<00:02:40.380> still<00:02:40.920> a<00:02:40.950> decent<00:02:41.160> amount<00:02:41.430> so<00:02:41.790> i<00:02:41.970> hope<00:02:42.300> you

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
it's still a decent amount so i hope you

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.740
