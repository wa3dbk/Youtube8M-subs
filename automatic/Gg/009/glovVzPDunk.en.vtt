it<00:00:40.560> a<00:00:40.710> device<00:00:41.040> very<00:00:41.550> thin<00:00:42.530> and<00:00:43.530> also<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.010> makes

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
it a device very thin and also it makes

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.010 
it a device very thin and also it makes
it<00:00:44.310> very<00:00:44.340> like<00:00:47.600> what<00:00:48.600> do<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.750> think<00:00:48.900> about
