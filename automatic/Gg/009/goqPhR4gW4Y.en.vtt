00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.179 

hi<00:00:05.850> everyone<00:00:06.150> this<00:00:06.560> tire<00:00:07.560> had<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:07.799> leaky<00:00:08.160> valve

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
hi everyone this tire had a leaky valve

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.480 
hi everyone this tire had a leaky valve
stem<00:00:08.700> and<00:00:08.940> I<00:00:09.780> tried<00:00:10.590> everything<00:00:10.889> to<00:00:11.219> get<00:00:11.309> the

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
stem and I tried everything to get the

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.459 
stem and I tried everything to get the
tire<00:00:11.759> off<00:00:11.790> so<00:00:12.360> that<00:00:12.509> I<00:00:12.540> could<00:00:12.809> put<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.080> new<00:00:13.259> valve

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
tire off so that I could put a new valve

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.110 
tire off so that I could put a new valve
stem<00:00:13.769> in<00:00:13.920> but<00:00:14.190> it<00:00:14.429> wasn't<00:00:14.730> easy

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
stem in but it wasn't easy

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.349 
stem in but it wasn't easy
I<00:00:15.150> tried<00:00:15.929> beating<00:00:16.320> on<00:00:16.410> it<00:00:16.529> with<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.680> sledge

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:17.359 
I tried beating on it with a sledge

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.240 
I tried beating on it with a sledge
jumping<00:00:18.359> up<00:00:18.449> and<00:00:18.570> down<00:00:18.660> on<00:00:18.779> it<00:00:19.080> throwing<00:00:20.070> it

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
jumping up and down on it throwing it

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.759 
jumping up and down on it throwing it
against<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.609> ground<00:00:20.789> at<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.060> funny<00:00:21.300> angle<00:00:21.769> but

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
against the ground at a funny angle but

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.220 
against the ground at a funny angle but
the<00:00:23.100> tires<00:00:23.730> bead<00:00:24.150> stayed<00:00:24.539> firmly<00:00:24.840> pressed

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
the tires bead stayed firmly pressed

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.130 
the tires bead stayed firmly pressed
against<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.590> rim<00:00:25.859> no<00:00:26.130> matter<00:00:26.310> what<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.519> did<00:00:27.140> but

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
against the rim no matter what I did but

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.960 
against the rim no matter what I did but
this<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.890> way<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.010> finally<00:00:29.340> managed<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.820> get

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
this is the way I finally managed to get

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.460 
this is the way I finally managed to get
the<00:00:30.090> bead<00:00:30.269> broken<00:00:30.660> loose<00:00:30.869> so<00:00:31.080> that<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.260> could

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
the bead broken loose so that I could

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.430 
the bead broken loose so that I could
put<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.650> new<00:00:31.800> valve<00:00:31.980> stem<00:00:32.340> in<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:33.079> put<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.170> space

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
put a new valve stem in I put the space

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.440 
put a new valve stem in I put the space
saver<00:00:34.680> on<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.980> car<00:00:35.160> in<00:00:35.309> place<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.969> problem

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
saver on the car in place of the problem

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.740 
saver on the car in place of the problem
tire<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:38.210> then<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.629> got<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.050> board<00:00:41.329> and<00:00:42.329> used<00:00:42.570> it

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
tire and then I got a board and used it

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.990 
tire and then I got a board and used it
as<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:42.899> ramp<00:00:43.290> so<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.370> can<00:00:44.520> put<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.760> cars

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
as a ramp so that I can put the cars

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.750 
as a ramp so that I can put the cars
weight<00:00:45.329> on<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:46.170> tire<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.680> break<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.579> bead

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
weight on the tire and break the bead

00:00:47.760 --> 00:01:02.290 
weight on the tire and break the bead
loose<00:00:48.030> from<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.450> rim

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.729 

that<00:01:03.300> board<00:01:03.630> turned<00:01:03.900> out<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.140> not<00:01:04.170> be<00:01:04.320> strong

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
that board turned out to not be strong

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.100 
that board turned out to not be strong
enough<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:05.400> we'll<00:01:06.150> try<00:01:06.390> again<00:01:06.600> with<00:01:06.750> two

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
enough so we'll try again with two

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:35.990 
enough so we'll try again with two
boards

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.850 

all<00:01:36.420> right<00:01:36.840> there's<00:01:37.140> room<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.350> get<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.710> out

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
all right there's room to get that out

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:46.660 
all right there's room to get that out
of<00:01:37.890> there<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.130> put<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.430> new<00:01:38.610> valve<00:01:38.790> stem<00:01:39.120> in

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.420 

I<00:01:46.990> put<00:01:47.990> a<00:01:48.020> little<00:01:48.200> dish<00:01:48.530> soap<00:01:48.800> on<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:49.130> valve

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
I put a little dish soap on the valve

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.219 
I put a little dish soap on the valve
stem<00:01:49.760> to<00:01:49.909> make<00:01:50.030> it<00:01:50.180> slide<00:01:50.510> into<00:01:50.690> its<00:01:50.900> spot<00:01:51.050> a

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
stem to make it slide into its spot a

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.420 
stem to make it slide into its spot a
little<00:01:51.500> more<00:01:51.650> easily<00:01:53.290> and<00:01:54.290> then<00:01:55.040> I<00:01:55.070> tried

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
little more easily and then I tried

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.250 
little more easily and then I tried
holding<00:01:55.610> it<00:01:55.909> with<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:56.450> pliers<00:01:56.750> to<00:01:56.900> keep<00:01:57.170> my

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
holding it with the pliers to keep my

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:06.910 
holding it with the pliers to keep my
fingers<00:01:57.619> out<00:01:57.770> of<00:01:57.830> harm's<00:01:58.400> way

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.540 

but<00:02:07.490> that<00:02:08.119> wasn't<00:02:08.420> going<00:02:08.509> to<00:02:08.600> work<00:02:08.720> so<00:02:09.110> I<00:02:09.550> ended

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
but that wasn't going to work so I ended

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:17.850 
but that wasn't going to work so I ended
up<00:02:10.670> with<00:02:10.850> my<00:02:10.880> fingers<00:02:11.330> in<00:02:11.480> there<00:02:11.630> anyway

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.830 

and<00:02:18.130> then<00:02:18.310> just<00:02:18.580> holding<00:02:19.000> it<00:02:19.090> in<00:02:19.240> place<00:02:19.450> with

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
and then just holding it in place with

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.270 
and then just holding it in place with
the<00:02:19.870> pliers

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.340 

now<00:02:24.820> all<00:02:25.000> I<00:02:25.030> have<00:02:25.240> to<00:02:25.360> do<00:02:25.510> is<00:02:25.630> get<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:25.990> tire

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
now all I have to do is get the tire

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:40.030 
now all I have to do is get the tire
back<00:02:26.620> on<00:02:26.830> the<00:02:26.860> rim

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.280 

this<00:02:40.489> might<00:02:40.730> look<00:02:40.879> a<00:02:40.940> little<00:02:41.120> silly<00:02:41.450> but<00:02:41.870> it

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
this might look a little silly but it

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.930 
this might look a little silly but it
does<00:02:42.500> really

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
does really

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:56.520 
does really
almost<00:02:44.660> there

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:11.160 

back<00:02:57.070> on<00:02:57.280> the<00:02:57.460> ground<00:02:57.610> so

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.760 

okay<00:03:11.890> I<00:03:12.220> need<00:03:12.460> to<00:03:12.610> go
