close-up of his weapon now the width and

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.700 
close-up of his weapon now the width and
mechanism<00:00:10.860> are<00:00:11.190> pretty<00:00:12.150> awesome<00:00:12.710> little

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
gimmicks now I'm not a huge fan of width

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.550 
gimmicks now I'm not a huge fan of width
and<00:00:15.900> gimmicks<00:00:16.470> myself<00:00:16.920> but<00:00:17.310> anyway<00:00:18.289> when<00:00:19.289> you

you know probably noticed already I blew
the<00:00:22.380> surprise<00:00:22.529> so<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.670> made<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:24.029> so<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.420> the

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
the surprise so I made it so that the

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.089 
the surprise so I made it so that the
weapon<00:00:24.840> will<00:00:25.019> stay<00:00:25.320> in<00:00:26.660> extended<00:00:27.660> mode<00:00:28.099> most

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
weapon will stay in extended mode most

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.310 
weapon will stay in extended mode most
of<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.369> time<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:30.060> all<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.779> times<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.140> they

of the time the all the times and they
come<00:00:31.470> out<00:00:31.500> as<00:00:31.679> I<00:00:31.800> can<00:00:31.920> just<00:00:32.430> spring<00:00:32.940> out<00:00:33.030> and

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
come out as I can just spring out and

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.479 
come out as I can just spring out and
snap<00:00:33.600> back<00:00:33.829> you<00:00:34.829> know<00:00:34.950> there's<00:00:35.250> something<00:00:35.460> to

snap back you know there's something to
be<00:00:35.579> said<00:00:35.610> for<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:36.030> fun<00:00:36.210> spring<00:00:36.630> gimmick<00:00:36.989> however

be said for a fun spring gimmick however
when<00:00:39.030> especially<00:00:39.329> with<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.629> cool<00:00:39.899> Chainsaw

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
when especially with a cool Chainsaw

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
and with a spring mechanism

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.979 
and with a spring mechanism
it<00:00:47.789> won't<00:00:48.090> stay<00:00:48.450> extended<00:00:49.910> unless<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.809> is

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
it won't stay extended unless this is

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.959 
it won't stay extended unless this is
the<00:00:52.020> easiest<00:00:52.379> thing<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.649> do<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.850> would

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
the easiest thing to do to you you would

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.150 
the easiest thing to do to you you would
say<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.420> know<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.570> can<00:00:54.930> unscrew<00:00:55.469> these<00:00:55.800> on

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
say you know you can unscrew these on

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.529 
say you know you can unscrew these on
the<00:00:56.309> bottom<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:57.120> take<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.360> whole<00:00:57.510> thing

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
the bottom and take the whole thing

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.220 
the bottom and take the whole thing
apart<00:00:57.719> when<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.530> don't<00:00:59.520> even<00:00:59.820> need<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.230> use

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
apart when it don't even need to use

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.750 
apart when it don't even need to use
this<00:01:01.440> thing<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.739> do<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.280> probably

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
this thing to do and this is probably

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.820 
this thing to do and this is probably
this<00:01:02.879> is<00:01:02.940> functional<00:01:03.510> with<00:01:03.539> I'm<00:01:03.960> sure<00:01:04.500> many

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
this is functional with I'm sure many

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.399 
this is functional with I'm sure many
not<00:01:05.670> just<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:06.090> one<00:01:06.270> many<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:07.020> mech-tech

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
not just this one many of you mech-tech

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.500 
not just this one many of you mech-tech
weapons<00:01:08.479> so<00:01:09.479> as<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:10.590> can<00:01:10.740> see<00:01:10.909> this<00:01:11.909> gray<00:01:12.210> part

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
weapons so as you can see this gray part

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.460 
weapons so as you can see this gray part
slides<00:01:13.140> between<00:01:14.060> it's<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.930> green<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.409> the

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
slides between it's in the green and the

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.330 
slides between it's in the green and the
track<00:01:16.740> in<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.220> green<00:01:17.430> part<00:01:17.790> right<00:01:18.380> so<00:01:19.380> what<00:01:20.100> we

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
track in the green part right so what we

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.149 
track in the green part right so what we
what<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:20.820> did<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:22.020> just<00:01:22.290> put<00:01:22.619> some<00:01:22.650> super<00:01:23.130> glue

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
what I did is I just put some super glue

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.280 
what I did is I just put some super glue
on<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:24.090> inside<00:01:24.600> edges<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:25.490> the<00:01:26.490> green<00:01:26.729> part<00:01:27.290> so

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
on the inside edges of the green part so

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.620 
on the inside edges of the green part so
the<00:01:28.740> grey<00:01:28.920> part<00:01:28.950> slides<00:01:29.939> in<00:01:30.180> between<00:01:30.479> the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
the grey part slides in between the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.990 
the grey part slides in between the
green<00:01:30.869> right<00:01:31.170> well<00:01:31.799> I<00:01:31.979> put<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.549> little<00:01:32.700> bit<00:01:32.880> of

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
green right well I put a little bit of

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.940 
green right well I put a little bit of
glue<00:01:33.240> on<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.720> inside<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.200> green<00:01:34.350> part<00:01:34.680> so

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
glue on the inside of the green part so

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.160 
glue on the inside of the green part so
that<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.220> narrows<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.090> opening<00:01:36.840> it's<00:01:37.110> a

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
that it narrows the opening it's a

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.649 
that it narrows the opening it's a
little<00:01:37.380> bit<00:01:37.470> thinner<00:01:38.189> there<00:01:38.520> right<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.060> that

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
little bit thinner there right so that

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.069 
little bit thinner there right so that
means<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.470> as<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:41.210> friction<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:42.840> the

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
means that this as a friction so the

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.190 
means that this as a friction so the
gray<00:01:43.259> part<00:01:43.500> slides<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.759> actually<00:01:45.210> stay<00:01:45.630> put

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
gray part slides and actually stay put

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.260 
gray part slides and actually stay put
right<00:01:46.439> there<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:46.860> then<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.640> can<00:01:47.759> push<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.149> out

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
right there and then you can push it out

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.440 
right there and then you can push it out
and<00:01:48.479> it'll<00:01:48.600> go<00:01:49.259> go<00:01:49.920> back<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.490> normal<00:01:50.970> mode<00:01:51.240> I

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
and it'll go go back to normal mode I

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.010 
and it'll go go back to normal mode I
used<00:01:52.110> my<00:01:52.770> role<00:01:53.430> super<00:01:53.909> glue<00:01:54.090> with<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.420> brush

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
used my role super glue with the brush

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.319 
used my role super glue with the brush
I'll<00:01:55.079> find<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.350> show<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.939> sailing<00:01:56.939> it's

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
I'll find the show to you sailing it's

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.639 
I'll find the show to you sailing it's
like<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.540> whiteout<00:01:58.729> makes<00:01:59.729> it<00:01:59.909> super<00:02:00.270> easy<00:02:00.649> to

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
like a whiteout makes it super easy to

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.090 
like a whiteout makes it super easy to
just<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:02.430> hit<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.540> put<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.500> on<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.680> inside

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
just a hit and put it on the inside

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.550 
just a hit and put it on the inside
there<00:02:05.600> turn<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:06.689> over<00:02:06.780> put<00:02:07.079> on<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.229> other<00:02:07.290> side

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
there turn it over put on the other side

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.979 
there turn it over put on the other side
I<00:02:07.770> let<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.729> dry<00:02:08.759> upside<00:02:09.270> down<00:02:09.479> so<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:09.869> it

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
I let it dry upside down so that it

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:10.559 
I let it dry upside down so that it
wouldn't

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
wouldn't

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.949 
wouldn't
we<00:02:10.780> wouldn't<00:02:11.140> fall<00:02:11.379> into<00:02:11.650> it<00:02:11.950> now<00:02:12.400> I<00:02:12.430> did<00:02:12.760> it<00:02:12.959> to

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
we wouldn't fall into it now I did it to

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:15.809 
we wouldn't fall into it now I did it to
two<00:02:14.950> and<00:02:15.129> a<00:02:15.159> half<00:02:15.310> I<00:02:15.430> guess<00:02:15.579> you<00:02:15.639> can<00:02:15.730> say

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
two and a half I guess you can say

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.929 
two and a half I guess you can say
things<00:02:16.030> three<00:02:16.420> times<00:02:17.040> so<00:02:18.040> I<00:02:18.069> put<00:02:18.370> glue<00:02:18.579> into<00:02:18.760> it

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:18.939 
things three times so I put glue into it

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:22.050 
things three times so I put glue into it
let<00:02:19.420> it<00:02:19.450> dry<00:02:19.719> I<00:02:20.200> tested<00:02:20.920> it<00:02:21.010> out<00:02:21.189> it<00:02:21.489> helps<00:02:21.849> a

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
let it dry I tested it out it helps a

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.030 
let it dry I tested it out it helps a
little<00:02:22.180> but<00:02:22.510> not<00:02:22.689> very<00:02:22.870> much<00:02:23.139> the<00:02:23.349> springs<00:02:23.680> so

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
little but not very much the springs so

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.890 
little but not very much the springs so
pretty<00:02:24.280> strong<00:02:24.489> so<00:02:24.700> I<00:02:24.760> waited<00:02:25.329> for<00:02:25.510> it<00:02:25.599> to<00:02:25.689> dry

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
pretty strong so I waited for it to dry

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.020 
pretty strong so I waited for it to dry
I<00:02:26.079> put<00:02:26.829> another<00:02:27.040> layer<00:02:27.310> in<00:02:27.639> there<00:02:27.849> another

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
I put another layer in there another

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.500 
I put another layer in there another
coat<00:02:28.359> and<00:02:28.629> then<00:02:29.500> it<00:02:29.650> was<00:02:29.799> really<00:02:30.400> staying<00:02:30.700> nice

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
coat and then it was really staying nice

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.629 
coat and then it was really staying nice
and<00:02:31.569> firm<00:02:31.959> however<00:02:32.469> it<00:02:32.620> was<00:02:32.859> not<00:02:33.099> quite<00:02:33.370> all

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:33.639 
and firm however it was not quite all

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:35.520 
and firm however it was not quite all
the<00:02:33.849> way<00:02:33.879> to<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.180> end<00:02:34.750> in<00:02:35.019> there<00:02:35.200> so<00:02:35.439> I<00:02:35.469> put

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
the way to the end in there so I put

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.740 
the way to the end in there so I put
another<00:02:35.889> third<00:02:36.430> layer<00:02:36.700> in<00:02:36.879> now<00:02:37.329> it's<00:02:37.540> really

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
another third layer in now it's really

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.440 
another third layer in now it's really
firm<00:02:38.079> now<00:02:38.469> it's<00:02:38.709> it<00:02:39.010> stays<00:02:39.430> obviously<00:02:40.209> you<00:02:40.299> can

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
firm now it's it stays obviously you can

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.959 
firm now it's it stays obviously you can
see<00:02:40.919> nice<00:02:41.919> and<00:02:42.159> tight<00:02:42.340> so<00:02:44.669> you<00:02:45.669> got<00:02:45.819> to<00:02:45.909> make

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:45.969 
see nice and tight so you got to make

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:47.699 
see nice and tight so you got to make
sure<00:02:46.120> not<00:02:46.359> to<00:02:46.389> let<00:02:46.599> the<00:02:46.719> glue<00:02:46.900> run<00:02:47.290> you<00:02:47.590> know

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
sure not to let the glue run you know

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.379 
sure not to let the glue run you know
dry<00:02:48.010> it<00:02:48.069> don't<00:02:48.250> let<00:02:48.400> it<00:02:48.459> drive<00:02:48.819> vertically

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:49.389 
dry it don't let it drive vertically

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:52.439 
dry it don't let it drive vertically
like<00:02:49.540> this<00:02:49.719> let<00:02:50.230> it<00:02:50.260> dry<00:02:50.560> upside<00:02:51.069> down<00:02:51.449> like

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:52.449 
like this let it dry upside down like

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:54.899 
like this let it dry upside down like
this<00:02:52.510> so<00:02:53.199> that<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.469> glue<00:02:53.919> if<00:02:54.129> any<00:02:54.370> of<00:02:54.430> it<00:02:54.609> falls

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:54.909 
this so that the glue if any of it falls

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:56.849 
this so that the glue if any of it falls
it'll<00:02:55.269> fall<00:02:55.419> out<00:02:55.449> on<00:02:55.810> there<00:02:55.930> you<00:02:56.500> know<00:02:56.590> put<00:02:56.829> a

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
it'll fall out on there you know put a

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:58.229 
it'll fall out on there you know put a
paper<00:02:57.250> or<00:02:57.370> something<00:02:57.579> underneath<00:02:57.819> it<00:02:58.000> as

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
paper or something underneath it as

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.330 
paper or something underneath it as
opposed<00:02:58.900> to<00:02:58.989> letting<00:02:59.230> it<00:02:59.409> fall<00:02:59.560> inside<00:03:00.010> and

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
opposed to letting it fall inside and

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.030 
opposed to letting it fall inside and
and<00:03:00.579> glue<00:03:01.480> your<00:03:01.629> mechanisms<00:03:02.169> into<00:03:02.409> place<00:03:02.709> or

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
and glue your mechanisms into place or

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.069 
and glue your mechanisms into place or
the<00:03:03.189> springs<00:03:03.519> and<00:03:03.760> whatnot<00:03:05.879> but<00:03:06.959> you<00:03:07.959> know

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
the springs and whatnot but you know

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.830 
the springs and whatnot but you know
that's<00:03:08.409> a<00:03:08.530> great<00:03:09.370> way<00:03:09.699> to<00:03:09.730> instantly<00:03:10.569> give

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
that's a great way to instantly give

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.559 
that's a great way to instantly give
yourself<00:03:11.169> a<00:03:11.370> nice<00:03:12.370> poseable<00:03:13.090> things<00:03:13.329> on

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
yourself a nice poseable things on

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.259
