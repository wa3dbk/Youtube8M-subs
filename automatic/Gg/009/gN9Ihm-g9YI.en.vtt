we're gonna make you a cutting board the
long<00:01:05.009> varying<00:01:05.460> cutting<00:01:05.820> board<00:01:06.710> again<00:01:07.710> pretty

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:08.009 
long varying cutting board again pretty

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.960 
long varying cutting board again pretty
much<00:01:08.159> out<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.429> scrap<00:01:10.490> of<00:01:11.490> course<00:01:11.700> when<00:01:11.850> it

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
much out of scrap of course when it

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.320 
much out of scrap of course when it
comes<00:01:12.179> to<00:01:12.360> cherry<00:01:12.690> and<00:01:12.899> maple<00:01:13.940> all<00:01:14.940> of<00:01:15.149> that

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
make something so let's make something

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.410 
make something so let's make something
it<00:01:25.979> looks<00:01:26.009> like<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:26.429> cherry<00:01:26.789> is<00:01:26.940> just<00:01:27.149> a<00:01:27.240> hair

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
it looks like this cherry is just a hair

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.510 
it looks like this cherry is just a hair
over<00:01:27.450> 1/2<00:01:27.960> inch<00:01:28.200> thick<00:01:28.289> once<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.069> get<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.340> plane

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
over 1/2 inch thick once I get it plane

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.919 
over 1/2 inch thick once I get it plane
down<00:01:29.729> it'll<00:01:30.030> be<00:01:30.149> right<00:01:30.299> out<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.600> half<00:01:32.869> it'll<00:01:33.869> be

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:33.929 
down it'll be right out of half it'll be

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:38.260 
down it'll be right out of half it'll be
a<00:01:34.049> thin<00:01:34.350> cutting<00:01:34.709> board<00:01:34.950> but<00:01:36.170> that's<00:01:37.170> alright

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
a thin cutting board but that's alright

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.420 
a thin cutting board but that's alright
so<00:01:39.590> to<00:01:40.590> get<00:01:40.710> started<00:01:40.860> we're<00:01:41.310> gonna<00:01:41.369> glue<00:01:41.670> up

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
so to get started we're gonna glue up

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.620 
so to get started we're gonna glue up
we're<00:01:44.430> gonna<00:01:44.520> make<00:01:44.759> sure<00:01:44.789> that<00:01:44.939> that<00:01:45.119> square

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
we're gonna make sure that that square

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.109 
we're gonna make sure that that square
that<00:01:45.930> looks<00:01:46.140> pretty<00:01:46.289> square<00:01:46.649> but<00:01:47.000> we're<00:01:48.000> gonna

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
that looks pretty square but we're gonna

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.310 
that looks pretty square but we're gonna
do<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.299> maple<00:01:48.930> on<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.140> outside<00:01:51.049> don't<00:01:52.049> get<00:01:52.200> our

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
do a maple on the outside don't get our

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.969 
do a maple on the outside don't get our
little<00:01:52.560> template<00:01:52.890> here<00:01:53.359> put<00:01:54.359> it<00:01:54.450> on<00:01:54.570> there

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
little template here put it on there

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:00.889 
little template here put it on there
trace<00:01:55.979> around<00:01:57.409> cut<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.530> out<00:01:59.509> so<00:02:00.509> I'm<00:02:00.600> gonna<00:02:00.750> get

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
trace around cut it out so I'm gonna get

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.469 
trace around cut it out so I'm gonna get
started<00:02:01.079> gluing<00:02:01.380> these<00:02:01.680> up<00:02:01.939> I'll<00:02:02.939> be<00:02:03.240> back

plane

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.890 

a lot<00:03:08.370> faster<00:03:08.790> to<00:03:08.819> use<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.030> plane<00:03:09.390> than<00:03:09.630> it<00:03:09.750> is

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
a lot faster to use the plane than it is

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.650 
a lot faster to use the plane than it is
to<00:03:10.140> use<00:03:10.530> a<00:03:10.560> sander<00:03:14.120> and<00:03:15.120> gives<00:03:15.420> you<00:03:15.510> a<00:03:15.540> little

got a little quarter inch roundover bit
to<00:03:50.480> do<00:03:50.599> the<00:03:50.750> top<00:03:51.400> now<00:03:52.400> right<00:03:52.640> there<00:03:52.879> I'm

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
to do the top now right there I'm

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.619 
to do the top now right there I'm
putting<00:03:53.390> in<00:03:53.450> a<00:03:53.569> chamfer<00:03:54.760> for<00:03:55.760> the<00:03:55.879> bottom<00:03:56.269> so

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:56.629 
putting in a chamfer for the bottom so

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:02.670 
putting in a chamfer for the bottom so
it's<00:03:56.780> easier<00:03:57.049> to<00:03:57.080> pick<00:03:57.319> up<00:04:00.459> when<00:04:01.459> transferring

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
it's easier to pick up when transferring

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.850 
it's easier to pick up when transferring
chamfering<00:04:03.680> little<00:04:04.190> pieces<00:04:04.400> like<00:04:05.209> that<00:04:05.269> I

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
chamfering little pieces like that I

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.500 
chamfering little pieces like that I
always<00:04:07.629> do<00:04:08.629> it<00:04:08.780> at<00:04:09.110> least<00:04:09.230> two<00:04:09.470> passes<00:04:10.510> helps

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
always do it at least two passes helps

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.309 
always do it at least two passes helps
avoid<00:04:11.780> chip<00:04:12.110> out<00:04:13.690> and<00:04:14.690> then<00:04:14.900> just<00:04:15.140> more

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:15.319 
avoid chip out and then just more
