make climbing boots 75k because he had

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.510

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
like five million of those I mean that

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.990 
like five million of those I mean that
that<00:02:53.760> would<00:02:53.880> be<00:02:53.910> some<00:02:54.420> some<00:02:55.110> shit<00:02:55.380> right<00:02:55.410> there

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
message you over YouTube but the reason

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.309 
message you over YouTube but the reason
why<00:05:26.979> it<00:05:27.490> was<00:05:27.729> decided<00:05:28.060> to<00:05:28.539> be<00:05:28.690> 15<00:05:29.050> minutes

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:29.319 
why it was decided to be 15 minutes

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:33.379 
why it was decided to be 15 minutes
because<00:05:30.039> each<00:05:30.520> light<00:05:30.849> counted<00:05:31.389> as<00:05:31.800> 250k<00:05:32.800> I

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:33.389 
because each light counted as 250k I

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:36.180 
because each light counted as 250k I
said<00:05:34.389> that<00:05:34.570> in<00:05:34.750> an<00:05:34.900> annotation<00:05:35.440> and<00:05:35.830> still

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
said that in an annotation and still

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.890 
said that in an annotation and still
didn't<00:05:36.520> get<00:05:36.610> that<00:05:36.789> much<00:05:36.940> like<00:05:37.270> so<00:05:37.509> that's<00:05:37.719> why

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
didn't get that much like so that's why

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.510 
didn't get that much like so that's why
it's<00:05:37.930> only<00:05:38.229> 50<00:05:38.530> mil<00:05:38.740> you<00:05:38.919> guys<00:05:39.039> had<00:05:39.219> a<00:05:39.250> choice
