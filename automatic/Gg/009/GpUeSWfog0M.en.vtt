00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
all the way I would love to it and then

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.410 
all the way I would love to it and then
I<00:00:18.170> target<00:00:19.170> here<00:00:20.010> I<00:00:20.189> don't<00:00:20.880> talk<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.119> lot<00:00:21.210> of

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
I target here I don't talk a lot of

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.060 
I target here I don't talk a lot of
people<00:00:21.660> will<00:00:21.779> target<00:00:21.960> here<00:00:22.439> but<00:00:22.650> that's<00:00:22.830> bad

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
people will target here but that's bad

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.580 
people will target here but that's bad
don't<00:00:23.580> do<00:00:23.760> that<00:00:24.140> target<00:00:25.140> like<00:00:25.260> right<00:00:25.410> there

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
don't do that target like right there

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.759 
don't do that target like right there
that's<00:00:28.590> much<00:00:28.859> more<00:00:29.039> consistent<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:29.730> target

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:30.769 
that's much more consistent and target

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:33.620 
that's much more consistent and target
basically<00:00:31.769> right<00:00:31.980> there<00:00:32.160> that<00:00:32.399> much<00:00:33.270> ensures

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
basically right there that much ensures

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.930 
basically right there that much ensures
that<00:00:33.719> you're<00:00:33.960> not<00:00:34.079> gonna<00:00:34.200> get<00:00:34.410> screwed<00:00:34.710> over

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
that you're not gonna get screwed over

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.069 
that you're not gonna get screwed over
and<00:00:36.680> that<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.950> how<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.309> do<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.030> double<00:00:39.690> LJ

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
and that is how you do that double LJ

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.590 
and that is how you do that double LJ
and<00:00:40.379> moving<00:00:41.160> on<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.550> next<00:00:41.730> double<00:00:42.030> LJ<00:00:42.329> in

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
and moving on to the next double LJ in

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:50.290 
and moving on to the next double LJ in
this<00:00:42.930> temple<00:00:46.910> avoid<00:00:47.910> this<00:00:48.180> guy

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
this temple avoid this guy

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.270 
this temple avoid this guy
you<00:00:50.870> can<00:00:51.020> actually<00:00:51.140> do<00:00:51.440> full<00:00:51.710> four<00:00:52.040> rolls

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
you can actually do full four rolls

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.930 
you can actually do full four rolls
right<00:00:52.460> here<00:00:52.670> if<00:00:52.760> you<00:00:52.850> do<00:00:52.969> them<00:00:53.120> quick<00:00:53.360> enough

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.740 

okay<00:00:58.940> and<00:00:59.090> then<00:00:59.180> just<00:00:59.329> like<00:00:59.420> pretty<00:00:59.629> much

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
okay and then just like pretty much

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.680 
okay and then just like pretty much
anywhere<00:01:00.110> up<00:01:00.290> here<00:01:00.460> 1<00:01:01.460> 2<00:01:01.579> 3<00:01:01.699> 4<00:01:02.000> then<00:01:02.149> 5<00:01:02.360> on<00:01:02.600> the

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
anywhere up here 1 2 3 4 then 5 on the

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.180 
anywhere up here 1 2 3 4 then 5 on the
right<00:01:03.940> and<00:01:04.960> luckily<00:01:05.960> enough<00:01:06.050> it<00:01:06.500> stayed<00:01:06.890> on

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
right and luckily enough it stayed on

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.040 
right and luckily enough it stayed on
the<00:01:07.340> right<00:01:07.520> target<00:01:07.940> there<00:01:08.119> long<00:01:08.630> enough<00:01:08.869> for

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
the right target there long enough for

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.770 
the right target there long enough for
me<00:01:09.200> for<00:01:09.619> this<00:01:09.710> to<00:01:09.830> actually<00:01:09.979> work<00:01:10.420> because<00:01:11.420> the

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
me for this to actually work because the

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.230 
me for this to actually work because the
way<00:01:12.380> this<00:01:12.560> LJ<00:01:12.950> works<00:01:13.250> is<00:01:13.700> um<00:01:15.729> basically<00:01:16.729> you

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
way this LJ works is um basically you

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.560 
way this LJ works is um basically you
don't<00:01:18.140> know<00:01:18.649> how<00:01:18.979> long<00:01:19.310> the<00:01:20.090> targets<00:01:20.479> are

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
don't know how long the targets are

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.749 
don't know how long the targets are
gonna<00:01:20.659> stay<00:01:21.050> on<00:01:21.080> one<00:01:21.500> side<00:01:21.830> like<00:01:22.190> over<00:01:22.520> here

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
gonna stay on one side like over here

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.120 
gonna stay on one side like over here
like<00:01:23.420> some<00:01:23.570> people<00:01:23.840> just<00:01:23.869> go<00:01:24.080> 1<00:01:24.259> 2<00:01:24.380> 3<00:01:24.410> 4<00:01:24.530> 5<00:01:24.800> and

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
like some people just go 1 2 3 4 5 and

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.400 
like some people just go 1 2 3 4 5 and
just<00:01:25.220> risk<00:01:25.759> it<00:01:25.970> but<00:01:26.570> that's<00:01:26.720> really<00:01:26.960> bad<00:01:27.170> cuz

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.410 
just risk it but that's really bad cuz

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:28.510 
just risk it but that's really bad cuz
you<00:01:27.500> never<00:01:27.710> know<00:01:27.950> how<00:01:28.130> long<00:01:28.190> you're<00:01:28.340> gonna

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
you never know how long you're gonna

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.100 
you never know how long you're gonna
stay<00:01:28.820> over<00:01:28.850> on<00:01:29.119> the<00:01:29.240> right<00:01:29.420> and<00:01:29.450> most<00:01:29.840> of<00:01:30.050> the

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
stay over on the right and most of the

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.249 
stay over on the right and most of the
time<00:01:30.289> they<00:01:30.500> won't<00:01:30.740> stay<00:01:31.070> over<00:01:31.280> there<00:01:31.840> 1<00:01:32.840> 2<00:01:32.960> 3<00:01:33.080> 4

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
time they won't stay over there 1 2 3 4

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.060 
time they won't stay over there 1 2 3 4
5<00:01:33.410> and<00:01:33.679> then<00:01:33.710> 1<00:01:34.039> over<00:01:34.070> here<00:01:35.440> 1<00:01:36.440> and<00:01:36.679> then<00:01:36.800> I<00:01:36.890> can

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
5 and then 1 over here 1 and then I can

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.200 
5 and then 1 over here 1 and then I can
wait<00:01:37.220> for<00:01:37.429> it<00:01:37.460> to<00:01:37.550> go<00:01:37.670> over<00:01:37.700> there<00:01:37.940> and<00:01:38.090> then

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
wait for it to go over there and then

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.749 
wait for it to go over there and then
there<00:01:38.390> too<00:01:38.600> and<00:01:39.560> it's<00:01:39.830> usually<00:01:39.950> safer<00:01:40.580> to<00:01:40.670> do

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
there too and it's usually safer to do

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:42.010 
there too and it's usually safer to do
the<00:01:40.850> second<00:01:41.210> one<00:01:41.240> because<00:01:41.479> you<00:01:41.570> see<00:01:41.720> I<00:01:41.750> landed

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
the second one because you see I landed

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.450 
the second one because you see I landed
a<00:01:42.110> lot<00:01:42.259> more<00:01:42.440> in<00:01:42.619> the<00:01:42.830> middle<00:01:43.009> of<00:01:43.160> the<00:01:43.250> platform

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
a lot more in the middle of the platform

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.639 
a lot more in the middle of the platform
and<00:01:43.970> I<00:01:44.119> landed<00:01:44.570> over<00:01:44.750> here<00:01:45.170> when<00:01:45.289> I<00:01:45.320> did<00:01:45.560> it

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
and I landed over here when I did it

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:47.529 
and I landed over here when I did it
with<00:01:45.740> the<00:01:45.860> first<00:01:46.070> one<00:01:46.220> I've<00:01:47.119> just<00:01:47.149> been<00:01:47.390> doing

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
with the first one I've just been doing

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:48.940 
with the first one I've just been doing
it<00:01:47.720> for<00:01:47.869> a<00:01:47.929> long<00:01:48.050> time<00:01:48.110> so<00:01:48.500> I<00:01:48.560> just<00:01:48.710> kind<00:01:48.890> of

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
it for a long time so I just kind of

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.290 
it for a long time so I just kind of
know<00:01:49.100> how<00:01:49.429> to<00:01:50.920> avoid<00:01:51.920> falling<00:01:52.820> off<00:01:52.940> the<00:01:53.119> ledge

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
know how to avoid falling off the ledge

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.880 
know how to avoid falling off the ledge
when<00:01:53.509> I<00:01:53.539> do<00:01:53.659> the<00:01:53.810> targets<00:01:54.200> like<00:01:54.470> I<00:01:54.619> know<00:01:54.679> where

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
when I do the targets like I know where

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.249 
when I do the targets like I know where
to<00:01:54.920> do<00:01:55.069> the<00:01:55.190> targets<00:01:55.580> so<00:01:55.849> I<00:01:56.149> won't<00:01:56.959> fall<00:01:57.229> off

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
to do the targets so I won't fall off

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:03.130 
to do the targets so I won't fall off
the<00:01:57.590> ledge<00:02:01.179> that<00:02:02.179> we'll<00:02:02.360> see<00:02:02.750> right<00:02:02.899> there

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
the ledge that we'll see right there

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.690 
the ledge that we'll see right there
they<00:02:03.319> disappeared<00:02:03.860> really<00:02:04.250> really<00:02:04.489> quickly

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
they disappeared really really quickly
