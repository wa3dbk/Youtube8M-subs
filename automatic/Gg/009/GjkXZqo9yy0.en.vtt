00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:17.840
 Hello everyone, today we will see the 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:21.420
 brake pad maintenance 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:25.260
 so we'll see how to do it 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:31.050
 cleaning and periodic inspection of 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:33.149
 tablets in this case in this case 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.520
 of this brake the first thing 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.920
 we must do is proceed with the removal 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.789
 of this life of retention of the 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:47.069
 then we will use a torx key 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:51.239
 in this case, once the unscrewed the 

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:55.890
 lives we can remove and then now 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:01:00.929
 we can proceed to remove two 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:07.159
 tablets we took our two 

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:09.090
 tablets and now we have to check 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:15.470
 possible wear if the case of 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.470
 replace them or if they are still fine 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.580
 we take the cleaning and reassembly 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:29.560
 to measure the wear of a pad 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:33.399
 brake we can use a caliber of 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:38.110
 measure the thickness of the material 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:39.210
 braking if the thickness is at least one 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.350
 millimeter 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:47.470
 then the pill but still good 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.710
 otherwise we will have to proceed to 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.990
 replacement with this case we see that 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:57.399
 that we still have a millimeter of 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.960
 thickness of the braking paste 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.850
 so we can proceed with cleaning 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.850
 of the tablets 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:21.290
 the first thing we can proceed with one 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.989
 fine-grained sandpaper a 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:31.870
 sand the surface of the 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:38.450
 braking paste once we have it 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:40.819
 sanded the braking paste we proceed 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.620
 to the police 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.310
 the usa is not just alcohol and some 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.310
 blotting paper 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.250
 here in this way using alcohol 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.430
 we have removed all the impurities 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.410
 present on the braking material of the 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.320
 tablet 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:09.640
 at this point we can reassemble the 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:11.770
 our pads clearly if we 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.560
 we had to replace these 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.450
 tablets with tablets 9 before 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.880
 enter in new ones 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.650
 pads we should get in 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.460
 pistons in their seats 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.260
 this because now having some 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.720
 tablets already quite worn i 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.850
 pistons have leaked slightly 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.130
 from their offices and then going to 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.750
 insert the same new tablets 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.200
 they wouldn't have the space to do it 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:42.100
 then enter what we can do 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:48.210
 proceed in two ways or remove the 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:51.190
 wheel or the brake caliper body 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:53.710
 in such a way as to not have not have 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:57.130
 the disc and track in the work and 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:59.800
 then with a plastic object one 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:03.330
 leverage hunting tires we do fall into 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.330
 their seats the two pistons 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:17.290
 at this point we can reassemble the 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:19.709
 our pads and we insert them into them 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.810
 original position 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:28.200
 obviously now we insert the network of 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:30.970
 retention and screw it completely 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.550
 since we carried out the 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.150
 maintenance of the pads and therefore 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.500
 we have cleaned and checked for wear 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.950
 convenient to do a cleaning of the 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.810
 disk 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:44.500
 we can do it always using 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.630
 so we use alcohol in the paper 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:51.370
 absorbent and with alcohol 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:54.040
 we proceed to clean the disc 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:58.330
 then the good thing will also do a 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:03.280
 check the tightening of the screws of the 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:06.670
 finally my advice is 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:11.470
 to do this at least 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:13.390
 every three months but denies it to have the 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.070
 our braking system always below 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.550
 control 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.550
 Hello everybody
