00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.420
 very good guys let's talk in the 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.220
 Today's video of the spells and 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.139
 spells because as we know it's something 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.820
 fundamental to attack and surely 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.770
 more than once we have had to 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.510
 improve it to get a new one and that's not 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.340
 and this is our case and we have left 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.800
 approximately two days and six hours 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.530
 to have the factory ready again and 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.930
 have now 4x or what is the problem that 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.660
 we are currently at war and so 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.090
 we have an army and the question is 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.129
 can attack if he wanted me then if there is 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.140
 know how to use army and for me the 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.269
 army that is best done with and without 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.070
 those good is the mega attack because 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:45.540
 because many times then to people 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.070
 the ten supermen and 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.290
 two stars for the army that carries 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.540
 it's an army that ensures a lot 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.850
 very much very much so nothing more 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.100
 attack the 17 the only thing that needs to be done 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.920
 is also attacking a village a little 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.379
 inferior to yours 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.320
 if you are number 5 then until I 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.780
 be from 10 to 12 you know that you do not either 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.909
 go to motivate a lot a lot so nothing 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.590
 more first take out the clan castle and 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.960
 we go right now without that which is the most 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.460
 important we do not have the plaster and nothing 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.409
 let's go here we take the castle a 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.600
 corner and here in the corner well what 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:20.180
 we're going to kill so we're not going there 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.280
 for them come here I love you 1 2 and 3 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.500
 we are here in madrid 2 and for them 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.090
 come all the dead writings here 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.640
 we are going to find therefore I understand music 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.940
 let's see to see if they are capable then of 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.700
 there perfect let's go a golem around here 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.860
 others cursed here and here there 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.810
 others over there like there over here breaks 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.580
 wall here breaks wall and nothing the 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.440
 problem is that at the beginning when 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.360
 start clear light water good the 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.310
 spells are not as fundamentals 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.020
 You can say but when you start 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.259
 understand the dynamics of the game if 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.600
 you start to see that what is needed and 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.580
 then when you start to value it like that 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.590
 that we swam yesterday around here pk here in king 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.390
 here the queen and good can be followed 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.520
 our first war with queen archer 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.590
 let's try to get to the center what 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.700
 as soon as possible and nothing we will go through here 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.979
 another magician 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.569
 and protected people and we're going to try 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.580
 that magicians do not survive the greatest 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.769
 possible number so nothing we can 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.180
 find here a damn and perfect 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:17.330
 are focusing our units here 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.920
 so none of that then try little to 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.900
 little that the units reach the center 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.489
 they get the two minimum star 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.220
 for me in more reliable armies if I 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.870
 did the mega attack ever want us to 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.300
 has passed ever happen to us because 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.810
 you always have to improve the barracks 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.980
 You can say it in the plaster factory 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.049
 posts camps all there is to 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.269
 improve it and in this case then 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:40.849
 we need to improve in order to be able to 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.950
 or more the jump liquid and nothing we see 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:46.239
 it's five days and let's go start wars 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.500
 Well, that's what you have to take and improve it 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.170
 then we are running out of 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.239
 internet that I do not like anything nothing we're going 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.610
 let's see let's see come to the queen has 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.950
 put with the town hall and now better 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.019
 falls one hundred percent of eye that we have 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.000
 even more reason and we have freckles that 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.860
 they are of good level and a barbarian king who 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.510
 we have not used his skill yet 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.760
 so I think that if we can not 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.410
 get up to 100 well worth we have 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.080
 lost the connection 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.240
 we can not use the king's ability 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.160
 Well, guys, we'll leave it more or less 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.960
 where we were before and the truth that 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.450
 nothing quite pity because well the 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.920
 repetition and we have thus achieved a 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.660
 quite high percentage if 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.460
 we would have used the skill of 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.890
 king barbarians we would probably have 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.600
 got one hundred percent we can see 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.700
 like here a cannon that is already focusing 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.880
 to the barbarian king and then they are not going to 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.890
 now quickly destroy the opponent 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.720
 what is serving it tank unit and the 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.190
 queen who was to die another little 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.440
 because a queen that was of low level and 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.060
 has little life but good the king 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.500
 is serving tank unit and now 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.220
 The only thing that remains is two 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:51.500
 guns and that those two cannons now 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.880
 using a skill then we would have 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.800
 got the king to have barbara 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.420
 survived and that this has gone 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.970
 making time to destroy the tower of 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.800
 magician and destroy two cannons flights 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.660
 that there is a pity not being able to use 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.640
 the skill but we strain internet 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.560
 but more or less you can see what 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.210
 we want to talk about what can be done 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.460
 get good stars a percentage 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.930
 without the plaster only you have to use a 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.660
 army is viable in this case a 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.860
 mega attack that is quite reliable a 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.080
 army that without equipment can reach 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.880
 quite far away and nothing came I hope that 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.820
 has served them when I go to 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.430
 attack so you use armies that 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.260
 are available armies that have 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.150
 results of truth and yes yes if not 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.919
 you have there that you never use 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.169
 pigs because 50 options ride them 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:34.640
 because they are nothing I could add or with 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:36.950
 the dragons you can risk with 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.810
 mega attack even basic army but 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.340
 we have never our because they have 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.990
 to go against it and assure minimum action 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.400
 so I do not say anything good here, I hope that 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.660
 they like do the video do not forget give 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.350
 like and subscribe to be less next 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.350
 goodbye
