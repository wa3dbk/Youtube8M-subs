you<00:01:54.640> be<00:01:54.789> looking<00:01:55.090> at<00:01:55.179> 180<00:01:55.569> plus

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.779 

so<00:02:03.659> we're<00:02:03.810> doing<00:02:03.869> 40<00:02:04.409> miles<00:02:04.590> an<00:02:04.770> hour<00:02:04.890> is<00:02:05.250> sixth

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
so we're doing 40 miles an hour is sixth

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.150 
so we're doing 40 miles an hour is sixth

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
reps so let's see what the engines like

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.890 
reps so let's see what the engines like
sec<00:02:11.340> here<00:02:11.610> there's<00:02:11.879> 60<00:02:12.620> 80

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
don't get any surges of power it's just

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.540
