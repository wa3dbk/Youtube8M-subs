00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
around their shoulder blades I mean they

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.810 
around their shoulder blades I mean they
can<00:01:15.450> get<00:01:15.570> really<00:01:15.869> high<00:01:16.260> and<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:17.189> bra<00:01:17.580> is

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820

isn't<00:01:18.180> doing<00:01:18.420> anything<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:19.049> support<00:01:19.229> the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
isn't doing anything to support the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.200

doing the job properly and you want to

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.069 
doing the job properly and you want to
consider<00:01:31.229> coming<00:01:31.439> down<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.830> band<00:01:32.189> size<00:01:33.079> this

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
consider coming down a band size this

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.050 
consider coming down a band size this
riding<00:01:34.560> up<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:34.860> what<00:01:35.009> causes<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.490> rest<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:35.970> the

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
riding up is what causes the rest of the

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.179 
riding up is what causes the rest of the
problems<00:01:36.509> so<00:01:37.140> second<00:01:37.500> problem<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.890> most

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
problems so second problem the most

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.310 
problems so second problem the most
common<00:01:38.520> problem<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:38.909> as<00:01:39.150> this<00:01:39.390> band<00:01:39.659> rides<00:01:40.020> up

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
common problem is as this band rides up

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.190 
common problem is as this band rides up
it<00:01:40.680> takes<00:01:41.250> with<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.820> straps<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:43.049> it's

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
it takes with it the straps and it's

shoulder this is such a common issue get

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:48.980 
shoulder this is such a common issue get
lots<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:47.880> ladies<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.180> have<00:01:48.390> my<00:01:48.509> straps<00:01:48.810> are

constantly falling off and invariably it

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.319 
constantly falling off and invariably it
tends<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.259> be<00:01:52.500> because<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:53.549> band<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.090> too

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
tends to be because the band is too

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.080 
tends to be because the band is too
loose<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:55.229> whole<00:01:55.500> thing<00:01:55.950> rides<00:01:56.189> up<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.759> the

loose the whole thing rides up and the

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.240 
loose the whole thing rides up and the
straps<00:01:57.360> can't<00:01:57.689> hold<00:01:58.200> on<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.710> so<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.920> end<00:01:59.070> up

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
straps can't hold on and so the end up

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.300 
straps can't hold on and so the end up
being<00:01:59.520> sore<00:01:59.790> popped<00:02:00.060> off<00:02:00.299> your<00:02:00.450> shoulder<00:02:01.310> when

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:02.659 
spilling out the top your cup so you try

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:04.240 
spilling out the top your cup so you try

all these different cup sizes and it's

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.190 
all these different cup sizes and it's
still<00:03:04.519> not<00:03:04.700> doing<00:03:05.030> anything<00:03:05.239> and<00:03:05.719> that's

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
still not doing anything and that's

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.500 
still not doing anything and that's
because<00:03:06.680> it's<00:03:06.919> hard<00:03:07.219> to<00:03:07.519> assess<00:03:08.239> whether

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
because it's hard to assess whether

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.300
