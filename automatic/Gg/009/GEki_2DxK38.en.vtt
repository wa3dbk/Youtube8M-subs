and get a benefit from it and this is
what<00:03:44.250> blizzards<00:03:44.609> we<00:03:44.730> really<00:03:45.239> tried<00:03:45.450> to<00:03:45.480> do

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:45.689 
what blizzards we really tried to do

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:47.240

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
they're reducing these new mechanics

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.890 
they're reducing these new mechanics
based<00:03:50.159> on<00:03:50.400> death<00:03:50.849> we<00:03:51.060> saw<00:03:51.239> this<00:03:51.419> kind<00:03:51.719> of<00:03:51.780> with

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
based on death we saw this kind of with

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.869 
based on death we saw this kind of with
bulb<00:03:52.169> are<00:03:52.409> a<00:03:52.680> little<00:03:52.889> witch<00:03:53.189> everybody's<00:03:53.760> like

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
bulb are a little witch everybody's like

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:57.170 
bulb are a little witch everybody's like
yeah<00:03:54.290> but<00:03:55.290> this<00:03:56.219> is<00:03:56.430> another<00:03:56.700> way<00:03:56.939> they're

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
yeah but this is another way they're

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.780 
yeah but this is another way they're
tackling<00:03:57.389> that<00:03:57.629> same<00:03:58.260> basic<00:03:58.980> issue<00:03:59.219> so<00:03:59.609> it's

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
tackling that same basic issue so it's

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.860 
tackling that same basic issue so it's
kind<00:04:00.000> of<00:04:00.120> cool<00:04:00.359> uh<00:04:00.829> but<00:04:01.909> will<00:04:02.909> it<00:04:02.939> see<00:04:03.419> play

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
kind of cool uh but will it see play

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.140 
kind of cool uh but will it see play
people<00:04:04.620> will<00:04:04.949> try<00:04:05.310> it<00:04:05.370> people<00:04:06.000> will

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
people will try it people will

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.819 
people will try it people will
definitely<00:04:06.750> try<00:04:06.930> it<00:04:06.989> the<00:04:07.169> fact<00:04:07.349> that<00:04:07.439> you<00:04:07.680> can

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
definitely try it the fact that you can

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:11.300 
definitely try it the fact that you can
direct<00:04:08.040> this<00:04:08.129> anywhere<00:04:09.260> so<00:04:10.260> it<00:04:10.859> is<00:04:10.919> possible

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
direct this anywhere so it is possible

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.539 
direct this anywhere so it is possible
it's<00:04:12.299> very<00:04:12.719> very<00:04:13.079> possible<00:04:13.139> and<00:04:13.889> like<00:04:14.400> I<00:04:14.489> said

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
it's very very possible and like I said

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.759 
it's very very possible and like I said
it<00:04:14.909> works<00:04:15.090> with<00:04:15.239> a<00:04:15.269> flame<00:04:15.540> strike<00:04:15.900> it<00:04:16.530> works

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:33.889 
time in placing a value on this it's

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:36.460 
time in placing a value on this it's
just<00:06:34.220> a<00:06:34.490> kitty<00:06:35.240> to<00:06:35.449> be<00:06:35.570> really<00:06:35.900> really<00:06:35.990> good<00:06:36.139> or

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:36.470

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:40.270 
just a kitty to be really really good or
it<00:06:36.530> could<00:06:36.710> just<00:06:36.740> be<00:06:36.979> really<00:06:37.490> really<00:06:39.280> only

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:40.280 
it could just be really really only

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.279 
it could just be really really only
time<00:06:40.460> will<00:06:40.520> tell<00:06:40.669> and<00:06:41.090> that's<00:06:41.810> the<00:06:42.080> thing

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:42.289 
time will tell and that's the thing

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:44.020 
time will tell and that's the thing
we're<00:06:43.039> going<00:06:43.130> to<00:06:43.220> need<00:06:43.340> to<00:06:43.520> do<00:06:43.729> a<00:06:43.759> lot<00:06:44.000> of

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.030 
we're going to need to do a lot of

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.089 
we're going to need to do a lot of
testing<00:06:44.449> with<00:06:44.599> a<00:06:44.630> lot<00:06:44.900> of<00:06:44.930> these<00:06:45.110> cards<00:06:45.530> now

00:06:46.089 --> 00:06:46.099 
testing with a lot of these cards now

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:47.499 
testing with a lot of these cards now
sometimes<00:06:46.580> these<00:06:46.729> cars<00:06:47.030> we've<00:06:47.300> seen

00:06:47.499 --> 00:06:47.509 
sometimes these cars we've seen

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:49.650 
sometimes these cars we've seen
obviously<00:06:48.080> had<00:06:48.259> like<00:06:48.560> some

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:49.660 
obviously had like some

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.990

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.000 
value you look at the hungry dragon a

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.280 
value you look at the hungry dragon a
lot<00:06:52.180> of<00:06:52.300> people<00:06:52.540> think<00:06:52.660> that<00:06:52.750> that's<00:06:53.170> a<00:06:53.260> bad

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:53.290 
lot of people think that that's a bad

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:56.250 
lot of people think that that's a bad
car<00:06:53.710> even<00:06:54.400> though<00:06:54.580> the<00:06:54.850> best<00:06:55.180> one<00:06:55.600> drop<00:06:55.840> minion

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:56.260 
car even though the best one drop minion

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.440 
car even though the best one drop minion
your<00:06:56.860> protocol<00:06:57.250> possibly<00:06:57.850> get<00:06:58.000> to<00:06:58.150> deal<00:06:58.330> with

00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:58.450 
your protocol possibly get to deal with

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:05.310 
your protocol possibly get to deal with
it<00:06:58.600> is<00:06:58.750> going<00:06:59.260> to<00:06:59.380> be<00:06:59.470> a<00:06:59.500> 3-2<00:07:01.590> but<00:07:03.660> it's<00:07:04.660> still<00:07:04.990> a

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:05.320 
it is going to be a 3-2 but it's still a

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:09.170 
it is going to be a 3-2 but it's still a
metric<00:07:06.430> ton<00:07:06.460> better<00:07:07.680> than<00:07:08.680> the<00:07:08.800> pit<00:07:08.950> lord

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:09.180 
metric ton better than the pit lord

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:13.470 
metric ton better than the pit lord
so<00:07:10.440> 10<00:07:11.440> time<00:07:12.130> will<00:07:12.370> tell<00:07:12.550> and<00:07:12.790> testing<00:07:13.240> will

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:13.480 
so 10 time will tell and testing will

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.590 
so 10 time will tell and testing will
definitely<00:07:14.670> show<00:07:15.670> the<00:07:15.850> value<00:07:15.970> of<00:07:16.300> some<00:07:16.480> of

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:16.600 
definitely show the value of some of

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.420 
definitely show the value of some of
these<00:07:16.660> cards<00:07:17.170> are<00:07:17.410> the<00:07:17.470> ones<00:07:17.980> we<00:07:18.100> looked<00:07:18.250> at
