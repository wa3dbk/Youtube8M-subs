00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.370 
I actually have been using this product
way<00:00:22.890> before<00:00:23.609> I<00:00:23.670> started<00:00:24.480> using<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.960> Nioxin

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
way before I started using the Nioxin

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.740 
way before I started using the Nioxin
thermal<00:00:26.010> bliss<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.880> will<00:00:27.119> say<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.539> these

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
thermal bliss and I will say that these

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.290 
thermal bliss and I will say that these
two<00:00:28.369> they<00:00:29.369> are<00:00:29.550> comparable<00:00:30.710> this<00:00:31.910> elastic<00:00:32.910> QP

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.200 
two they are comparable this elastic QP
is<00:00:33.600> for<00:00:34.050> thermal<00:00:34.320> styling<00:00:34.800> obviously<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:35.940> what

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
is for thermal styling obviously in what

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.889 
is for thermal styling obviously in what
I<00:00:36.440> use<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.649> for<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.129> like<00:00:38.399> blow<00:00:38.640> drying<00:00:39.030> roller

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
I use it for is like blow drying roller

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.030 
I use it for is like blow drying roller
setting<00:00:40.640> and<00:00:41.640> stuff<00:00:41.969> like<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:43.040> this

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
setting and stuff like that so this

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.029 
setting and stuff like that so this
absolutely<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:45.149> does<00:00:45.450> work<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.410> would<00:00:46.710> say

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
absolutely it does work and I would say

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.420 
absolutely it does work and I would say
it's<00:00:47.309> equal<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:50.239> the<00:00:51.239> Nioxin<00:00:51.800> only<00:00:52.800> downside

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
it's equal to the Nioxin only downside

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.950 
it's equal to the Nioxin only downside
