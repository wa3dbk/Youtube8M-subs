device is unique in its method of action

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.530

because it releases the potential vacuum

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.600 
because it releases the potential vacuum
and<00:00:47.780> thus<00:00:48.050> lessens<00:00:48.590> the<00:00:48.739> force<00:00:49.010> required<00:00:49.219> to
