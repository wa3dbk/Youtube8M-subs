00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
scrapping my fire beam trolley which was

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.509 
scrapping my fire beam trolley which was
excessively<00:00:07.160> overcomplicated<00:00:08.160> for<00:00:08.309> what<00:00:08.429> it

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
excessively overcomplicated for what it

was

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
was

I'm<00:00:09.330> gonna<00:00:09.480> build<00:00:09.660> a<00:00:09.750> nice<00:00:09.900> new<00:00:10.170> one<00:00:10.349> I<00:00:10.559> found

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
I'm gonna build a nice new one I found

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.830 
I'm gonna build a nice new one I found
this<00:00:11.550> tucked<00:00:11.790> inside<00:00:12.240> one<00:00:12.420> of<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.599> drawers

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
this tucked inside one of the drawers

this tucked inside one of the drawers
underneath<00:00:13.580> the<00:00:14.580> chassis<00:00:15.059> was<00:00:15.150> an<00:00:15.269> old

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
underneath the chassis was an old

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.760 
underneath the chassis was an old
photocopier<00:00:16.049> chassis<00:00:16.440> that<00:00:16.590> I've<00:00:16.680> been

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
photocopier chassis that I've been

hard<00:00:20.730> drive<00:00:21.000> in<00:00:21.150> there<00:00:21.330> at<00:00:21.420> one<00:00:21.570> stage<00:00:22.100> because

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
hard drive in there at one stage because

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.250 
hard drive in there at one stage because
this<00:00:23.250> is<00:00:23.400> what's<00:00:23.580> left<00:00:23.789> of<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.170> looks<00:00:25.170> like

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
this is what's left of it looks like

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.259 
this is what's left of it looks like
mostly<00:00:25.710> radiant<00:00:26.250> heat<00:00:26.460> damage<00:00:26.880> like<00:00:27.150> it

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
mostly radiant heat damage like it

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.169 
mostly radiant heat damage like it
hasn't<00:00:27.710> it's<00:00:28.710> burnt<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.099> PCB<00:00:29.699> it<00:00:29.820> was<00:00:29.939> sitting

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
hasn't it's burnt the PCB it was sitting

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.209 
hasn't it's burnt the PCB it was sitting
like<00:00:30.330> that<00:00:30.380> upright<00:00:31.489> or<00:00:32.489> bottom-up<00:00:33.559> so<00:00:34.559> the

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
like that upright or bottom-up so the

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.260 
like that upright or bottom-up so the
PCB<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:35.820> taking<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.239> hell<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.750> lot<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:36.899> damage

PCB is taking a hell of a lot of damage
same<00:00:39.270> with<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.480> outlawed<00:00:39.719> casing<00:00:40.200> but<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.350> can

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
same with the outlawed casing but I can

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.020 
same with the outlawed casing but I can
still<00:00:40.680> see<00:00:40.890> stickers<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.460> things<00:00:41.520> on<00:00:41.850> there

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
still see stickers and things on there

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.940 
still see stickers and things on there
which<00:00:42.120> are<00:00:42.270> intact<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:43.410> know<00:00:43.440> even<00:00:43.680> almost

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
which are intact you know even almost

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.150 
which are intact you know even almost
read<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.280> serial<00:00:44.670> number<00:00:44.940> on<00:00:44.969> it

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
read the serial number on it

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.310 
read the serial number on it
likewise<00:00:47.160> heat<00:00:47.430> from<00:00:47.579> underneath<00:00:48.050> when<00:00:49.050> fire

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
likewise heat from underneath when fire

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.799 
likewise heat from underneath when fire
was<00:00:49.530> burning<00:00:49.739> underneath<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.489> stand<00:00:50.820> but<00:00:51.660> you

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
was burning underneath the stand but you

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.299 
was burning underneath the stand but you
can<00:00:51.899> still<00:00:52.079> see<00:00:52.289> parts<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.800> sticker<00:00:53.100> it

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
can still see parts of the sticker it

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.510 
can still see parts of the sticker it
looks<00:00:53.489> like<00:00:53.640> an<00:00:53.820> 80<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.510> 100<00:00:54.960> gigabytes

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
looks like an 80 to 100 gigabytes

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.910 
looks like an 80 to 100 gigabytes
Seagate<00:00:56.520> Drive<00:00:57.170> I've<00:00:58.170> got<00:00:58.289> dozens<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.770> these

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
Seagate Drive I've got dozens of these

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.270 
Seagate Drive I've got dozens of these
so<00:00:59.309> it's<00:00:59.460> no<00:00:59.579> loss<00:00:59.850> at<00:01:00.030> all<00:01:00.149> but<00:01:00.949> chances<00:01:01.949> are

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
so it's no loss at all but chances are

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.039 
so it's no loss at all but chances are
if<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.520> was<00:01:02.640> in<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:02.940> stand<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.600> junk

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
if it was in that stand of junk

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.140 
if it was in that stand of junk
it<00:01:04.589> was<00:01:04.710> probably<00:01:05.100> junk<00:01:05.339> anyways<00:01:05.820> probably

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
it was probably junk anyways probably

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.020 
it was probably junk anyways probably
awaiting<00:01:06.540> autopsy<00:01:06.920> so<00:01:07.920> instead<00:01:08.340> we<00:01:08.580> have<00:01:08.610> what

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
awaiting autopsy so instead we have what

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.760 
awaiting autopsy so instead we have what
you'd<00:01:09.180> call<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.450> probably<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.049> recovered<00:01:10.500> fire

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
you'd call a probably a recovered fire

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.880 
you'd call a probably a recovered fire
victim<00:01:11.510> not<00:01:12.510> total<00:01:12.930> incineration<00:01:13.680> but

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
victim not total incineration but

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.320 
victim not total incineration but
partial<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.430> just<00:01:14.580> want<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.790> see<00:01:14.909> what<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.180> disk

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
partial I just want to see what the disk

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.780 
partial I just want to see what the disk
platter<00:01:15.540> looks<00:01:15.840> like<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:17.040> hate<00:01:17.340> will<00:01:17.549> kill

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
platter looks like and I hate will kill

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.310 
platter looks like and I hate will kill
the<00:01:17.939> magnetic<00:01:18.390> field<00:01:18.659> on<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.930> disk<00:01:19.080> platter

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
the magnetic field on the disk platter

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.800 
the magnetic field on the disk platter
and<00:01:19.590> ruin<00:01:19.890> any<00:01:20.040> data<00:01:20.369> but<00:01:20.640> I'm<00:01:21.479> just<00:01:21.630> curious

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
and ruin any data but I'm just curious

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.010 
and ruin any data but I'm just curious
as<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.140> how<00:01:22.409> hot<00:01:23.100> this<00:01:23.280> thing<00:01:23.490> got<00:01:23.869> it's<00:01:24.869> not

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
as to how hot this thing got it's not

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.649 
as to how hot this thing got it's not
it's<00:01:25.710> tarnished<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.820> plastic<00:01:27.240> labels

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
it's tarnished and the plastic labels

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.840 
it's tarnished and the plastic labels
burnt<00:01:28.080> off<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.470> but<00:01:28.590> it's<00:01:28.710> not<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:29.070> bad

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
burnt off it but it's not that bad

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.910 
burnt off it but it's not that bad
besides<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.049> worst<00:01:31.290> because<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.619> can<00:01:31.740> see

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
besides the worst because you can see

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.910 
besides the worst because you can see
most<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:33.140> epoxy<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.259> burnt<00:01:34.530> out<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.860> the

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
most of the epoxy is burnt out of the

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.440 
most of the epoxy is burnt out of the
fiberglass<00:01:35.250> PCB<00:01:37.130> so<00:01:38.180> it's<00:01:39.180> gotta<00:01:39.329> have<00:01:39.420> a

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
fiberglass PCB so it's gotta have a

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.910 
fiberglass PCB so it's gotta have a
screw<00:01:39.659> driver<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.049> I'll<00:01:40.140> open<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.470> up<00:01:40.590> let's

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
screw driver and I'll open it up let's

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.010 
screw driver and I'll open it up let's
have<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.070> look<00:01:41.220> at<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.670> did<00:01:42.479> wash<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.689> lot<00:01:42.869> of

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
have a look at it I did wash a lot of

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.600 
have a look at it I did wash a lot of
dirt<00:01:43.200> off<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.500> was<00:01:43.590> covered<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:43.890> mud<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.460> I'm

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
dirt off it was covered in mud so I'm

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.460 
dirt off it was covered in mud so I'm
I've<00:01:45.180> washed<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.720> so<00:01:45.899> there<00:01:46.020> might<00:01:46.140> be<00:01:46.170> water

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
I've washed it so there might be water

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.410 
I've washed it so there might be water
inside<00:01:46.950> but<00:01:47.280> we'll<00:01:47.880> see<00:01:48.030> if<00:01:48.119> it's<00:01:48.240> still

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
inside but we'll see if it's still

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.950 
inside but we'll see if it's still
sealed

sealed

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.749 
sealed
if<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.829> washing<00:01:50.159> didn't<00:01:50.369> get<00:01:50.490> in<00:01:50.610> there<00:01:50.729> that

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
if the washing didn't get in there that

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.289 
if the washing didn't get in there that
would<00:01:50.909> be<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.060> good<00:01:51.210> sign<00:01:53.030> okay<00:01:54.030> all<00:01:54.149> the

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
would be a good sign okay all the

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.109 
would be a good sign okay all the
board's<00:01:54.570> separated<00:01:55.200> okay<00:01:55.560> that's<00:01:56.280> very<00:01:56.369> well

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
board's separated okay that's very well

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.060 
board's separated okay that's very well
it<00:01:57.329> adhered<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.170> casing<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.799> see<00:01:58.950> it's

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
it adhered to the casing and see it's

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.810 
it adhered to the casing and see it's
just<00:01:59.219> glued<00:01:59.490> itself<00:01:59.850> on-site<00:02:00.329> pry<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.259> off

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
just glued itself on-site pry it off

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.530 
just glued itself on-site pry it off
head<00:02:03.420> up<00:02:03.540> for<00:02:03.660> the<00:02:04.430> read/write<00:02:05.430> head<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:06.270> the

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
head up for the read/write head and the

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.180 
head up for the read/write head and the
voice<00:02:07.500> coil<00:02:08.150> as<00:02:09.150> is<00:02:09.930> just<00:02:10.350> cemented<00:02:10.860> into<00:02:11.100> the

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
voice coil as is just cemented into the

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.530 
voice coil as is just cemented into the
casing<00:02:11.780> so<00:02:12.920> that's<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:14.100> part<00:02:14.400> done<00:02:14.700> motor

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
casing so that's that part done motor

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.120 
casing so that's that part done motor
well<00:02:16.080> I<00:02:16.200> think<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.410> motor<00:02:16.620> is<00:02:16.710> pretty<00:02:16.890> cooked

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
well I think the motor is pretty cooked

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.870 
well I think the motor is pretty cooked
we'll<00:02:17.310> see<00:02:17.430> if<00:02:17.520> it<00:02:17.580> still<00:02:17.790> spins<00:02:18.800> yeah<00:02:19.880> it's

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
we'll see if it still spins yeah it's

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.030 
we'll see if it still spins yeah it's
interesting<00:02:21.090> I<00:02:21.570> mean<00:02:22.170> I<00:02:22.260> burnt<00:02:22.500> hard<00:02:22.740> drives

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
interesting I mean I burnt hard drives

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.320 
interesting I mean I burnt hard drives
before<00:02:23.220> but<00:02:23.520> I<00:02:23.580> usually<00:02:23.700> just<00:02:23.880> burn<00:02:24.120> them<00:02:24.210> to

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
before but I usually just burn them to

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.580 
before but I usually just burn them to
the<00:02:24.420> point<00:02:24.600> where<00:02:24.840> there's<00:02:25.020> just<00:02:25.170> nothing

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
the point where there's just nothing

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.420 
the point where there's just nothing
left<00:02:26.090> so<00:02:27.650> these<00:02:28.650> screws<00:02:28.920> are<00:02:28.950> very<00:02:29.070> loose

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
left so these screws are very loose

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.040 
left so these screws are very loose
until<00:02:30.240> they've<00:02:30.420> gotten<00:02:30.690> hot<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.080> discolored

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
until they've gotten hot and discolored

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.690 
until they've gotten hot and discolored
well<00:02:34.050> I<00:02:34.350> think<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.800> would<00:02:34.890> be<00:02:34.950> safe<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.190> say<00:02:35.370> the

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
well I think it would be safe to say the

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.330 
well I think it would be safe to say the
magnetic<00:02:36.150> field<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:36.750> data<00:02:37.500> on<00:02:37.680> that<00:02:37.830> disk<00:02:38.100> is

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
magnetic field and data on that disk is

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.810 
magnetic field and data on that disk is
unrecoverable<00:02:40.070> that<00:02:41.070> got<00:02:41.280> a<00:02:41.310> lot<00:02:41.520> harder<00:02:41.550> than

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
unrecoverable that got a lot harder than

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.270 
unrecoverable that got a lot harder than
it<00:02:41.970> looks<00:02:42.380> just<00:02:43.380> there's<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.680> plastic<00:02:44.070> labels

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
it looks just there's the plastic labels

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.070 
it looks just there's the plastic labels
and<00:02:44.580> barcode<00:02:45.000> are<00:02:45.120> intact<00:02:45.510> it<00:02:45.720> doesn't<00:02:45.960> mean

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
and barcode are intact it doesn't mean

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.810 
and barcode are intact it doesn't mean
it<00:02:46.200> didn't<00:02:46.410> get<00:02:46.560> really<00:02:47.010> hot<00:02:47.190> especially<00:02:47.550> up

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
it didn't get really hot especially up

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.700 
it didn't get really hot especially up
this<00:02:48.000> end<00:02:48.240> here<00:02:49.340> plastic<00:02:50.340> from<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:51.710> terminal

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
this end here plastic from the terminal

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.960 
this end here plastic from the terminal
blocks<00:02:52.980> gone<00:02:55.400> some<00:02:56.400> of<00:02:56.520> that<00:02:56.610> should<00:02:56.880> have

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
blocks gone some of that should have

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.760 
blocks gone some of that should have
been<00:02:58.070> ribbon<00:02:59.070> cable<00:03:00.200> weathers<00:03:01.200> gone<00:03:01.350> nuts<00:03:01.620> out

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
been ribbon cable weathers gone nuts out

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.190 
been ribbon cable weathers gone nuts out
there<00:03:02.010> but<00:03:02.220> yeah<00:03:02.850> there's<00:03:03.060> a<00:03:03.150> ribbon<00:03:03.420> cable

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.210 

near<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.320> hole<00:03:07.470> that's<00:03:07.650> just<00:03:07.920> turned<00:03:08.100> into

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
near the hole that's just turned into

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:16.699 
near the hole that's just turned into
one<00:03:08.400> gooey<00:03:08.700> mess<00:03:12.830> look<00:03:13.830> at<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:13.980> disks

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.369 

it's<00:03:17.400> almost<00:03:17.579> like<00:03:17.760> smoke<00:03:18.060> residue<00:03:18.689> smoke

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379 
it's almost like smoke residue smoke

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:26.509 
it's almost like smoke residue smoke
residue<00:03:22.099> and<00:03:23.099> it<00:03:23.189> sort<00:03:23.489> of<00:03:23.549> moves<00:03:24.090> you<00:03:25.370> can<00:03:26.370> see

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
residue and it sort of moves you can see

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.039 
residue and it sort of moves you can see
underneath<00:03:26.909> the<00:03:27.120> head<00:03:27.299> head<00:03:27.629> arm<00:03:27.840> is

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
underneath the head head arm is

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.380 
underneath the head head arm is
collapsed<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:29.159> plastic<00:03:29.609> in<00:03:29.730> there<00:03:29.849> is<00:03:29.939> melted

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
collapsed the plastic in there is melted

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.580 
collapsed the plastic in there is melted
and<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:30.540> whole<00:03:30.719> lights<00:03:30.959> been<00:03:31.170> probably<00:03:31.379> been

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
and the whole lights been probably been

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.789 
and the whole lights been probably been
pulled<00:03:31.799> down<00:03:31.890> by<00:03:32.189> the<00:03:32.250> magnet<00:03:32.760> and<00:03:33.799> there's

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
pulled down by the magnet and there's

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.860 
pulled down by the magnet and there's
water<00:03:35.040> in<00:03:35.219> here<00:03:35.370> too<00:03:35.670> from<00:03:35.909> me<00:03:36.359> washing<00:03:36.780> it

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
water in here too from me washing it

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:45.619 
water in here too from me washing it
down<00:03:38.629> that's<00:03:39.629> a<00:03:39.989> very<00:03:40.230> stiff<00:03:40.590> motor<00:03:44.629> little

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
down that's a very stiff motor little

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:49.220 
down that's a very stiff motor little
throw<00:03:45.930> out<00:03:46.170> arm<00:03:46.439> the<00:03:46.650> centrifugal<00:03:47.720> lock<00:03:48.720> it

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
throw out arm the centrifugal lock it

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.929 
throw out arm the centrifugal lock it
stops<00:03:49.470> the<00:03:49.650> head<00:03:49.799> from<00:03:50.010> moving<00:03:50.220> when<00:03:50.579> unless

00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:50.939 
stops the head from moving when unless

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:54.530 
stops the head from moving when unless
the<00:03:51.090> disks<00:03:51.389> moving<00:03:53.030> yeah<00:03:54.030> she<00:03:54.269> got<00:03:54.359> a<00:03:54.419> little

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
the disks moving yeah she got a little

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.909 
the disks moving yeah she got a little
hotter<00:03:54.780> than<00:03:54.870> I<00:03:55.019> thought<00:03:55.230> just<00:03:55.620> because<00:03:55.650> the

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:55.919 
hotter than I thought just because the

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:58.339 
hotter than I thought just because the
labels<00:03:56.310> intact<00:03:56.700> doesn't<00:03:57.090> mean<00:03:57.239> it<00:03:58.169> wasn't

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
labels intact doesn't mean it wasn't

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:05.869 
labels intact doesn't mean it wasn't
badly<00:03:58.859> burned<00:04:01.310> that's<00:04:02.310> fascinating<00:04:04.879> it's

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
badly burned that's fascinating it's

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:12.220 
badly burned that's fascinating it's
nice<00:04:06.030> a<00:04:06.060> little<00:04:06.299> less<00:04:06.659> in<00:04:06.810> color<00:04:07.049> on<00:04:07.260> the<00:04:07.349> disk

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.470 

I'd<00:04:13.230> say<00:04:13.500> data<00:04:14.040> completely<00:04:14.669> unrecoverable

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
I'd say data completely unrecoverable

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.310 
I'd say data completely unrecoverable
there's<00:04:16.320> only<00:04:16.410> one<00:04:16.650> disk<00:04:16.859> in<00:04:17.099> there<00:04:17.340> and<00:04:17.609> it's

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
there's only one disk in there and it's

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.810 
there's only one disk in there and it's
well<00:04:19.320> cooked<00:04:21.409> into<00:04:22.409> that<00:04:22.650> one<00:04:22.800> thanks<00:04:23.669> for

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
well cooked into that one thanks for

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:24.290 
well cooked into that one thanks for
watching

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
watching

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.020 
watching
that<00:04:24.659> was<00:04:24.750> interesting
