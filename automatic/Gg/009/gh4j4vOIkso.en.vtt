00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.750 
I guess he knows he cannot read watch as
I<00:02:41.280> get<00:02:41.459> hit<00:02:41.640> by<00:02:41.850> simple<00:02:42.269> bullets<00:02:43.760> repeatedly

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
I get hit by simple bullets repeatedly

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.340 
I get hit by simple bullets repeatedly
but<00:02:45.390> anyway<00:02:45.780> you<00:02:45.840> just<00:02:46.230> have<00:02:46.350> to<00:02:46.470> fire<00:02:46.680> there

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
but anyway you just have to fire there

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.920 
but anyway you just have to fire there
if<00:02:49.350> this<00:02:49.560> was<00:02:49.769> a<00:02:50.040> normal<00:02:50.550> difficulty<00:02:51.390> he<00:02:51.750> would
