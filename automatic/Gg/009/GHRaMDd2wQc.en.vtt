00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
a loss of consciousness these are all

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.030 
a loss of consciousness these are all
reasons<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.850> see<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.030> doctor<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.990> how<00:01:31.710> are<00:01:31.890> they

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
reasons to see a doctor and how are they

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.120 
reasons to see a doctor and how are they
diagnosed<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.119> treated<00:01:33.380> well<00:01:34.380> luckily<00:01:34.710> they

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
diagnosed and treated well luckily they

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.370 
diagnosed and treated well luckily they
show<00:01:35.340> up<00:01:35.400> very<00:01:35.850> well<00:01:36.000> on<00:01:36.380> non-invasive

imaging<00:01:37.500> study<00:01:38.159> so<00:01:38.520> typically<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.930> the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
imaging study so typically the the

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.280 
imaging study so typically the the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.280

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
like a seizure would be a cat scan but

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.499 
like a seizure would be a cat scan but
usually<00:01:46.829> in<00:01:47.040> order<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.460> see<00:01:47.670> more<00:01:47.850> details<00:01:48.270> and

as 10 months which is 300 percent of

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
what we've done with any of our other

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.860 
what we've done with any of our other
techniques<00:04:10.359> so<00:04:10.959> I<00:04:11.170> think<00:04:11.680> as<00:04:12.069> as<00:04:12.870> discouraging

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
techniques so I think as as discouraging

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.319 
techniques so I think as as discouraging
and<00:04:14.079> is<00:04:14.410> not<00:04:15.010> truly<00:04:15.310> worrisome<00:04:15.940> as<00:04:16.180> this

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
and is not truly worrisome as this

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.960 
and is not truly worrisome as this
diagnosis<00:04:17.049> is<00:04:17.260> I<00:04:17.500> think<00:04:18.100> we're<00:04:18.310> right<00:04:18.489> on<00:04:18.700> the

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
diagnosis is I think we're right on the

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.580 
diagnosis is I think we're right on the
cusp<00:04:19.180> of<00:04:19.479> being<00:04:19.690> able<00:04:19.930> to<00:04:20.079> make<00:04:20.289> a<00:04:20.320> real

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
cusp of being able to make a real

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.730 
cusp of being able to make a real
difference<00:04:20.830> we<00:04:21.370> need<00:04:21.400> a<00:04:21.789> little<00:04:22.690> more<00:04:22.930> time<00:04:23.169> we

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
difference we need a little more time we

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.010 
difference we need a little more time we
need<00:04:23.919> a<00:04:23.950> lot<00:04:24.220> more<00:04:24.250> work

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
need a lot more work

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.020 
need a lot more work
you<00:04:25.349> need<00:04:25.530> more<00:04:25.710> money<00:04:25.860> to<00:04:26.220> work<00:04:26.250> on<00:04:26.639> it<00:04:26.819> but

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
you need more money to work on it but

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.900 
you need more money to work on it but
but<00:04:27.780> we're<00:04:27.930> getting<00:04:28.259> there<00:04:28.470> so<00:04:28.770> the<00:04:29.520> bottom

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
but we're getting there so the bottom
