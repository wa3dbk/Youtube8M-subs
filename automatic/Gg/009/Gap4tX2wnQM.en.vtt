anywhere<00:04:04.250> let's<00:04:05.250> see<00:04:05.489> this<00:04:05.700> real<00:04:05.970> quick<00:04:06.209> let's

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
anywhere let's see this real quick let's

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.050 
anywhere let's see this real quick let's
see<00:04:06.690> how<00:04:06.840> it's<00:04:07.049> centered<00:04:07.380> near<00:04:08.060> perfect

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
see how it's centered near perfect

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.560 
see how it's centered near perfect
centering<00:04:10.040> little<00:04:11.040> off<00:04:11.280> to<00:04:11.910> the<00:04:12.360> left<00:04:12.840> I<00:04:13.250> think

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
centering little off to the left I think

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.330 
centering little off to the left I think
take<00:04:15.570> another<00:04:15.840> look<00:04:15.959> at<00:04:16.200> that

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
take another look at that

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.729 
take another look at that
that's<00:04:18.269> pretty<00:04:18.660> close<00:04:18.930> good<00:04:19.260> enough<00:04:19.440> for<00:04:19.500> me

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
that's pretty close good enough for me

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.710 
that's pretty close good enough for me
really<00:04:19.980> but<00:04:20.280> um<00:04:20.549> maybe<00:04:21.090> a<00:04:21.209> little<00:04:21.389> bit<00:04:21.600> of

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
really but um maybe a little bit of

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.290 
really but um maybe a little bit of
tweaking<00:04:22.040> so<00:04:23.040> I<00:04:23.070> get<00:04:23.250> close<00:04:23.490> to<00:04:23.610> some<00:04:23.790> tools<00:04:24.000> I

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
tweaking so I get close to some tools I

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.909 
tweaking so I get close to some tools I
love<00:04:24.900> that<00:04:24.930> economics<00:04:25.470> of<00:04:25.530> this<00:04:25.650> because<00:04:25.770> you

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
love that economics of this because you

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.560 
love that economics of this because you
can<00:04:26.040> just<00:04:26.070> slide<00:04:26.460> your<00:04:26.490> finger<00:04:26.880> right<00:04:27.000> onto<00:04:27.540> it

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
can just slide your finger right onto it

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.460 
can just slide your finger right onto it
and<00:04:27.860> boom<00:04:28.860> there<00:04:29.100> it<00:04:29.130> goes<00:04:29.930> also<00:04:30.930> a<00:04:30.960> very<00:04:31.260> very
