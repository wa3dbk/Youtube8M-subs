you<00:03:06.870> know<00:03:06.960> if<00:03:07.020> you<00:03:07.140> tagged<00:03:07.350> in<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.590> open<00:03:07.920> there

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
you know if you tagged in the open there

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.130 
you know if you tagged in the open there
it's<00:03:08.190> still<00:03:08.340> part<00:03:08.550> of<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:08.700> chord<00:03:09.050> and<00:03:10.050> the

it's still part of the chord and the

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.850 
it's still part of the chord and the
whole<00:03:10.290> chord<00:03:10.590> might<00:03:10.740> take<00:03:10.890> a<00:03:10.920> little<00:03:11.100> practice

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
whole chord might take a little practice

whole chord might take a little practice
so<00:03:13.860> same<00:03:14.730> pattern<00:03:15.210> same<00:03:15.450> amount<00:03:15.720> of<00:03:15.810> times

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
so same pattern same amount of times

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:35.870 
so same pattern same amount of times
through<00:03:16.230> D<00:03:16.290> it<00:03:16.680> changes<00:03:17.130> the<00:03:17.250> course
