00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:05.900
 I understand these planes and helicopters they 

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:09.230
 just fly everywhere 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:11.830
 very close this time so calm 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.830
 the Germans 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.760
 Well, hello to all friends with you 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.699
 today's jeens is our modification 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.890
 created for guys who love hardcore 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.990
 tired of just running away 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.839
 from the police too easy for them 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.900
 so today we will have an attack from 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:35.600
 air with rockets so on aviation 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:38.870
 attack I don't know how we can survive 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.190
 against it we will drive we will try to 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.100
 in general, let's see what of this 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.800
 get to start on probably already 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.130
 some kind of means in order without 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.130
 problems hijacking yes the whole thing so i 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:55.900
 said no music lacked that 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.950
 I was banned as a matter of fact 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:02.540
 this modification is activated very 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:03.950
 just press f5 and damn it now 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.170
 something will be I specifically chose 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.540
 franklin to steal faster 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.390
 he has the possibility of half 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.640
 rotate and so on for now i'm not 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.850
 I see I already feel the resort attack with 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.180
 air is just hard 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.180
 as well ka ka 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:27.480
 here in short already something is behind us 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:30.630
 chasing I don’t know if we can leave but I smell 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.930
 me that it will not just be here 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.660
 bacchanalia begins anarchy with her husband 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.590
 either go far far here 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:49.920
 the bombardment is on I think if 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:54.710
 stop here then we die yes so 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.710
 that so just do not run away I do not know 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.710
 I think I need a tool what 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.860
 something better to run away and because 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:07.560
 what is it still happening like me 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:11.760
 understood so the idea of ​​f5 is we turn off yes 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.870
 good good constant constant 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.970
 constant bombing we don't need 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.239
 because so to play 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:22.330
 is impossible 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:25.840
 we need something faster drug 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:29.739
 motorcycle, I do not know anything right now 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.470
 think of a devil so in my opinion I found 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.120
 pretty cheerful car 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.950
 san andreas it was bullys if can 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.890
 Do you remember how it was very fast 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:43.060
 wheelbarrow and now on there so well i 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.950
 ready i'm ready chased as much as we can 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.170
 hold out the main thing is no harm with 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.599
 probably just test yourself from standing 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.549
 shod shooting and bombing here too 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.950
 I won't last long 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:57.220
 maybe I turned off the road somehow 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:03.549
 and did not understand where the explosions vogt stick-tree then 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:05.440
 and no no no funny guys i understand these 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:09.220
 airplanes and helicopters they are just everywhere 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:20.260
 fly very close this time 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:22.330
 so could the Germans and Wear I died yah 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:26.530
 in short long hold out very 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:28.630
 it's hard to tell you, but actually grief 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.840
 such a small modification write 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.430
 how much you were able to hold out well in 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.220
 turn on it all up enough literally 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.160
