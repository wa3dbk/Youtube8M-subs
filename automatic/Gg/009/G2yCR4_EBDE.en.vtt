 making small earrings yourself and if 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.060
 you want to know like the whole 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.010

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.190
 just turn it on 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.140
 I show you now only times what you 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.180
 everything needs about your earrings themselves 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.640
 to produce a few small ones 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.910
 items and me one 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.410
 such little rings if I still left 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.269
 find where he gets the stuff then 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.340
 I'll pack you in the infobox if then 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:58.370
 nothing is then I found nothing 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.079
 but you have to find something on ebay 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.789
 can either be very much abroad 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.670
 cheap or in germany something 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:06.170
 more expensive or on the hiking day there are 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.630
 not only finished jewelry but also 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.820
 the items you need to order 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.990
 which produce 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.270
 and yes here that I have it 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.350
 I think of the wanderer and that is 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.030
 but now a while ago 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.460
 I do not know if the shop still has it 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.790
 These are just such small rings as the ones 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.670
 subsequently as a link to the 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:29.270
 plug in the hangs in the ear and the 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.930
 trailer then we need something else 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.140
 here 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.850
 these are these little hammers so 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:40.220
 which I currently refer to as a straightener 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:43.850
 have the ear then and where 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.680
 after that the trailer trans is then plugged 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.630
 of course you need a motive that 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.180
 you like i have little ones here now 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.770
 Swallow taken shows you still 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.770
 time outside the bag 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.530
 you always come very many 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:02.240
 so then pay a price for one 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.590
 I do not know how 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.420
 many and then you have one first 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.620
 few could there be some for yours 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.209
 join in friends or if you are 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.830
 actually want to do a job 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.830
 you can directly several earrings 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.569
 produce the last thing we do then 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.890
 but maybe not 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.610
 Every one of you needs because I know 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.640
 many users 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.070
 The parts are not at all these pegs 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.710
 So these are the parts which then afterwards 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:27.100
 back come off 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:29.270
 so that the euro does not slip down 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.160
 maybe you know when you have yours 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.050
 bought then comes here always with 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.310
 and I know that many of them 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.480
 but I always throw that away 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.340
 Theron and then put it to me anyway 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.260
 Whenever I supported your 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.610
 it 's not going to be clean in the back 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.770
 slip and I have ever 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.300
 which I very much like to lose 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.130
 Maybe there was this stop should be like that 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.530
 broken and a bit too far and 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.850
 that's why I lost that then 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.550
 It annoyed me and that's why 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.020
 that's my turn 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.400
 and yes that's what we need 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.500
 that's not even as much as you 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.760
 Look and we'll start right now 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.739
 I 've got everything out now 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.120
 what we need now and what 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.600
 you still need as a tool is useless 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.360
 on 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.010
 the finer and the smaller it is 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.590
 better this has now a bit large 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.300
 but it works too and what I now consider 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.720
 First is this little ring 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.989
 I showed in the beginning and the 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.720
 Just hold tight 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:22.640
 and there is just such a small area 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.549
 you can open that 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.739
 try that somehow 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:30.320
 So I hope I could show it now 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:34.160
 see there is such a small gap and there 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:40.459
 you can stop with the tongs here 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:44.090
 grab beside and hold on here 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:47.799
 thumb and forefinger and then can 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:52.910
 Just do it like that 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:53.590
 then you grab that's the rule 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.780
 here 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.640
 and that could be his user here 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.680
 maybe see you and then you go 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.989
 just have it with the eyelet then 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.230
 you already in there and you take her 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:08.630
 your motive what you would like to have 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.070
 here the swallow as I said and me 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.900
 just stuck with the 1 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.870
 but it can be if you now too 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.950
 and after that I can hang it 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.540
 yes try it out maybe I have 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.579
 good luck and is not it that way 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.900
 slice then wrong so that depends 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.160
 only the back can see them then have 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.460
 do it again and get out again 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.740
 right in there would have to now one 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.680
 look a bit 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:34.880
 and now let's see if that's right 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.990
 is so that depends now so that is one 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.720
 bit silly now we see namely 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:42.009
 the swallow just sideways if you like that 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:45.139
 disturbs then you just take it like that 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:47.300
 So I suppose I am writing like this and now 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:49.810
 then I do not turn up here on to the 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.340
 the circle here at this on this 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:55.539
 connecting link but here 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.979
 at the top of the trailer at the bend of it 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:00.110
 and just turn it over a bit 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:02.720
 what then bends and thereby 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.590
 the whole piece of jewelry twists 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.599
 here below 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:11.180
 and then the spare hangs around like her 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:14.120
 should be and then the whole thing is in 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:16.729
 Found the only thing already finished 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.349
 Of course, it is still missing now 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:21.889
 Closure behind that we do now 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:26.419
 still on it and then the whole thing is 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:27.650
 already finished in other euro I have 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:28.970
 just finished before me 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.889
 look today if I still can but 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.539
 I could handle it as hard as it is 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:33.759
 Not 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:35.810
 And these are the finished earrings 

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:37.909
 Of course, today too could win 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:40.460
 which I already have here 

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:42.320
 which had been prepared I knew 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.550
 not that I'm splitting now 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.969
 That's why I already had here 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:49.159
 which are picked out the write 

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:53.509
 it was exactly the same as hers now 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:55.130
 also and have seen how to do that 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:57.620
 and then I have so little here 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:06:00.409
 key that I find very, very 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.849
 nice and very cute i would have 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:04.159
 also done a while ago and me 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:08.180
 I thought that's what I was giving you today 

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:10.069
 one of you can have two pairs of earrings 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.569
 win if he wants what he is doing now 

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:12.880
 need to win is simply a 

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:15.229
 write a comment 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.180
 just write whatever you want there 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:18.560
 no specific requirement i hope 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.240
 just that I liked that and 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.699
 that you maybe something yourself 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.530
 What jewelry is sown at sowed that 

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:26.330
 is really very easy and the 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:29.389
 Share costs really not the world 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:31.520
 I think you even save her 

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:32.990
 what else if you can do that yourself 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.460
 Of course, the whole thing more elaborate 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.990
 Make it pretty much now 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.470
 the simplest thing that can fool because 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.740
 you just 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:40.970
 only the basic elements are intertwined 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.150
 you can still pearl with it now 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:45.530
 install and anything but yes me 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.360
 I thought I show you only this first 

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:49.600
 because that's the nicest thing in the reason 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.860
 I think he just likes it 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.540
 and here, just write one 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.010
 commentary best says that 

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.600
 you want to take part with me too 

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.590
 directly knows who participates and would be 

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:01.130
 just a comment 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:03.560
 wrote and that was it 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.610
 that already went very well now 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.410
 then often as I said that you 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:08.120
 liked and I wish you one 

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:10.520
 quite a nice holiday season it 

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.160
 is now soon and all the others 

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:16.300
 You can still find rules in the infobox 

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.300
 and that 's it, that's good 

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:26.259
 then we come to my mother now 

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:27.789
 my mother wanted something and 

00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:30.400
 Although bed if I hope you take too 

00:07:27.789 --> 00:07:34.560
 numerous at the other youtuber part 

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.560
 they're looking forward to goodbye
