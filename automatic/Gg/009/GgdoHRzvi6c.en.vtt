ahead<00:02:56.220> and<00:02:56.430> tighten<00:02:56.610> down<00:02:56.760> our<00:02:56.910> valve<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:57.750> be

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
ahead and tighten down our valve and be

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.920 
ahead and tighten down our valve and be
sure<00:02:58.890> you<00:02:59.100> put<00:02:59.310> that<00:02:59.370> little<00:02:59.760> rubber<00:03:00.030> cap<00:03:00.420> back

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.080 
sure you put that little rubber cap back
on<00:03:01.230> your<00:03:01.470> valve<00:03:01.740> it's<00:03:02.100> very<00:03:02.490> important<00:03:03.030> to

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
on your valve it's very important to

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.640 
on your valve it's very important to
protect<00:03:03.450> these<00:03:03.600> valves<00:03:04.170> from<00:03:04.380> dirt<00:03:04.620> and

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
protect these valves from dirt and

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:12.520 
protect these valves from dirt and
debris<00:03:05.160> so<00:03:10.790> now<00:03:11.790> over

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.860 
reservoir through the system remember
when<00:03:29.690> your<00:03:29.840> reservoir<00:03:30.260> gets<00:03:30.590> to<00:03:30.800> the<00:03:30.950> low

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
when your reservoir gets to the low

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.390 
when your reservoir gets to the low
marker<00:03:33.130> it's<00:03:34.130> time<00:03:34.459> to<00:03:34.700> stop<00:03:35.150> pumping<00:03:36.400> because

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
marker it's time to stop pumping because

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.030 
marker it's time to stop pumping because
we<00:03:37.760> do<00:03:37.940> not<00:03:38.120> want<00:03:38.420> to<00:03:38.600> introduce<00:03:38.989> air<00:03:39.290> to<00:03:39.890> our

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
we do not want to introduce air to our

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.970 
we do not want to introduce air to our
brake<00:03:40.280> system<00:03:43.810> it<00:03:44.810> is<00:03:45.050> easy<00:03:45.290> enough<00:03:45.500> to<00:03:45.709> get

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
brake system it is easy enough to get

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.270 
brake system it is easy enough to get
the<00:03:46.160> air<00:03:46.340> out<00:03:46.370> if<00:03:47.000> you<00:03:47.690> do<00:03:47.920> having<00:03:48.920> to<00:03:49.010> suck

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
the air out if you do having to suck

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.890 
the air out if you do having to suck
some<00:03:49.550> through<00:03:49.820> you<00:03:50.030> just<00:03:50.060> refill<00:03:50.720> the

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
some through you just refill the

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.290 
some through you just refill the
reservoir<00:03:50.930> and<00:03:51.739> start<00:03:52.430> pulling<00:03:52.820> it<00:03:52.940> through

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
reservoir and start pulling it through

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.530 
reservoir and start pulling it through
once<00:03:54.019> you<00:03:54.200> get<00:03:54.470> clean<00:03:55.310> fluid<00:03:55.610> to<00:03:56.030> the<00:03:56.150> bottom

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
once you get clean fluid to the bottom

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.400 
once you get clean fluid to the bottom
to<00:03:56.930> the<00:03:57.050> calipers<00:03:58.330> then<00:03:59.330> on<00:03:59.720> some<00:04:00.200> brake

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
to the calipers then on some brake

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.550 
to the calipers then on some brake
systems<00:04:00.920> you<00:04:01.100> need<00:04:01.250> to<00:04:01.310> bleed<00:04:02.050> the<00:04:03.050> master

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
systems you need to bleed the master

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.360 
systems you need to bleed the master
cylinder

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
cylinder

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.360 
cylinder
which<00:04:04.730> will<00:04:04.940> have<00:04:05.120> a<00:04:05.150> bleeder<00:04:05.840> valve<00:04:06.200> up<00:04:07.010> by

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
which will have a bleeder valve up by

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:13.750 
which will have a bleeder valve up by
the<00:04:07.430> brake<00:04:07.970> lever<00:04:11.860> if<00:04:12.860> you<00:04:13.069> watch<00:04:13.280> any<00:04:13.550> of<00:04:13.700> my

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
the brake lever if you watch any of my

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.240 
the brake lever if you watch any of my
videos<00:04:13.880> you'll<00:04:14.600> see<00:04:14.870> that<00:04:15.170> pretty<00:04:15.650> much<00:04:15.830> every

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
videos you'll see that pretty much every

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.550 
videos you'll see that pretty much every
bike<00:04:16.489> it's<00:04:16.790> the<00:04:16.940> same

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.050 

so<00:04:21.560> now<00:04:21.710> we're<00:04:21.860> just<00:04:21.890> topping<00:04:22.550> off<00:04:22.730> our

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
so now we're just topping off our

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.810 
so now we're just topping off our
reservoir<00:04:23.810> with<00:04:24.620> clean<00:04:24.920> fluid<00:04:25.990> and<00:04:27.820> then

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
reservoir with clean fluid and then

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.540 
reservoir with clean fluid and then
we'll<00:04:28.970> put<00:04:29.210> the<00:04:29.300> cap<00:04:29.570> back<00:04:29.900> on<00:04:30.170> we<00:04:30.890> only<00:04:31.160> want

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
we'll put the cap back on we only want

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.430 
we'll put the cap back on we only want
to<00:04:31.610> go<00:04:31.790> to<00:04:31.850> the<00:04:32.120> upper<00:04:32.450> level<00:04:32.810> you<00:04:32.960> do<00:04:33.080> not<00:04:33.230> want

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
to go to the upper level you do not want

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:42.400 
to go to the upper level you do not want
to<00:04:33.530> go<00:04:33.650> past<00:04:33.950> the<00:04:34.190> upper<00:04:34.520> level<00:04:41.140> so<00:04:42.140> we<00:04:42.230> have

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
to go past the upper level so we have

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.959 
to go past the upper level so we have
the<00:04:42.530> cap

00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:42.969 
the cap

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:45.059 
the cap
back<00:04:43.089> on<00:04:43.360> and<00:04:43.719> then<00:04:44.019> we<00:04:44.139> need<00:04:44.289> to<00:04:44.409> replace<00:04:44.769> the

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:45.069 
back on and then we need to replace the

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:50.519 
back on and then we need to replace the
retaining<00:04:45.399> clip<00:04:45.879> and<00:04:46.089> the<00:04:46.989> screw<00:04:47.819> and<00:04:49.529> then

00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:50.529 
retaining clip and the screw and then

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:55.319 
retaining clip and the screw and then
that<00:04:50.709> will<00:04:50.889> conclude<00:04:51.279> our<00:04:52.289> yamaha<00:04:53.289> r1<00:04:54.329> front

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:55.329 
that will conclude our yamaha r1 front

00:04:55.329 --> 00:05:02.699 
that will conclude our yamaha r1 front
