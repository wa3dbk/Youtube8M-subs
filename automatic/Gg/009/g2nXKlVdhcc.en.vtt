down here you know under my chin sounds

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.689 
down here you know under my chin sounds
like<00:05:53.639> your<00:05:53.789> daily<00:05:54.210> routine<00:05:54.690> is<00:05:55.139> pretty

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:55.699 
like your daily routine is pretty

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:59.959 
like your daily routine is pretty
remarkable<00:05:56.699> yeah<00:05:58.219> we're<00:05:59.219> gonna<00:05:59.340> see<00:05:59.610> what<00:05:59.849> we

00:05:59.959 --> 00:05:59.969 
remarkable yeah we're gonna see what we

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:01.730 
remarkable yeah we're gonna see what we
can<00:06:00.150> do<00:06:00.270> the<00:06:00.389> helper<00:06:00.750> round<00:06:00.930> we<00:06:01.440> do<00:06:01.560> have<00:06:01.680> a

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
can do the helper round we do have a

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.529 
can do the helper round we do have a
graphic<00:06:02.219> that<00:06:02.370> I<00:06:02.460> want<00:06:02.669> to<00:06:02.729> show<00:06:02.880> is<00:06:03.030> exactly

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:03.539 
graphic that I want to show is exactly

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:06.020 
graphic that I want to show is exactly
how<00:06:03.810> the<00:06:03.870> laser<00:06:04.229> works<00:06:05.070> how<00:06:05.460> that<00:06:05.639> affects

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
how the laser works how that affects

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.180 
how the laser works how that affects
hair<00:06:06.240> follicles<00:06:06.780> obviously<00:06:07.710> we<00:06:07.770> first<00:06:08.039> up

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
hair follicles obviously we first up

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:10.399 
hair follicles obviously we first up
shave<00:06:08.460> the<00:06:08.639> hair<00:06:08.849> and<00:06:09.090> then<00:06:09.210> we<00:06:09.330> do<00:06:10.080> the<00:06:10.259> laser

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:10.409 
shave the hair and then we do the laser

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:12.790 
shave the hair and then we do the laser
treatment<00:06:10.979> and<00:06:11.340> those<00:06:11.430> beams<00:06:11.789> of<00:06:12.120> light

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 
treatment and those beams of light

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.890 
treatment and those beams of light
selectively<00:06:13.800> go<00:06:14.610> to<00:06:14.669> the<00:06:14.849> hair<00:06:15.060> follicles<00:06:15.360> are

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 
selectively go to the hair follicles are

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.560 
selectively go to the hair follicles are
targeting<00:06:16.469> the<00:06:16.620> melanin<00:06:17.190> in<00:06:17.370> the<00:06:18.090> the<00:06:18.389> hair

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:18.570 
targeting the melanin in the the hair

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.180 
targeting the melanin in the the hair
follicle<00:06:19.139> itself<00:06:19.500> which<00:06:19.710> is<00:06:19.830> a<00:06:19.860> specific

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190 
follicle itself which is a specific

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:23.860 
follicle itself which is a specific
wavelength<00:06:20.789> it<00:06:21.449> hits<00:06:22.050> that<00:06:22.289> it<00:06:22.770> affects<00:06:23.340> that

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:23.870 
wavelength it hits that it affects that

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.959 
wavelength it hits that it affects that
germinal<00:06:24.870> follicle<00:06:25.650> that<00:06:25.800> produces<00:06:26.370> hair<00:06:26.610> and

00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:26.969 
germinal follicle that produces hair and

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:29.300 
germinal follicle that produces hair and
basically<00:06:27.509> eliminates<00:06:28.469> it<00:06:28.590> and<00:06:28.860> the<00:06:28.919> problem

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310 
basically eliminates it and the problem

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.490 
basically eliminates it and the problem
for<00:06:29.490> some<00:06:29.729> women<00:06:30.090> is<00:06:30.270> there's<00:06:30.690> a<00:06:30.780> medical

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500 
for some women is there's a medical

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.100 
for some women is there's a medical
reason<00:06:31.560> why<00:06:32.210> there<00:06:33.210> may<00:06:33.449> be<00:06:33.479> excess<00:06:33.960> hair

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.110 
reason why there may be excess hair

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:35.719 
reason why there may be excess hair
growth<00:06:34.380> and<00:06:34.560> I<00:06:34.620> know<00:06:34.680> we<00:06:34.919> tested<00:06:35.339> your<00:06:35.490> blood

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:35.729 
growth and I know we tested your blood

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:36.620 
growth and I know we tested your blood
and<00:06:36.089> we're

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.630 
and we're

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:40.820 
and we're
we<00:06:37.410> just<00:06:37.620> wanted<00:06:38.010> to<00:06:38.750> check<00:06:39.750> all<00:06:39.990> of<00:06:40.020> our<00:06:40.320> bases

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:40.830 
we just wanted to check all of our bases

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.830 
we just wanted to check all of our bases
I<00:06:40.860> mean<00:06:41.100> she<00:06:41.280> doesn't<00:06:41.640> have<00:06:41.790> any<00:06:42.150> signs<00:06:42.630> or

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:42.840 
I mean she doesn't have any signs or

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.850 
I mean she doesn't have any signs or
symptoms<00:06:43.170> of<00:06:43.590> anything<00:06:44.070> else<00:06:44.280> going<00:06:44.640> on

symptoms of anything else going on

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.500 
symptoms of anything else going on
hormonal<00:06:46.860> II<00:06:47.130> but<00:06:47.430> we<00:06:47.760> we<00:06:48.060> checked<00:06:48.360> you

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:48.510 
hormonal II but we we checked you

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.110 
hormonal II but we we checked you
estrogen<00:06:49.050> progesterone<00:06:49.740> were<00:06:50.040> good<00:06:50.310> but<00:06:50.970> her

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 
estrogen progesterone were good but her

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.410 
estrogen progesterone were good but her
testosterone<00:06:51.800> actually<00:06:52.970> was<00:06:53.970> slightly

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:54.420 
testosterone actually was slightly

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.140 
testosterone actually was slightly
elevated<00:06:54.750> I<00:06:55.380> don't<00:06:56.310> think<00:06:56.520> it's<00:06:56.700> gonna<00:06:56.910> mean

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:57.150 
elevated I don't think it's gonna mean

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.540

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:18.810 
it would mean everything to me to be

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:20.150 
it would mean everything to me to be
able<00:07:18.930> to<00:07:18.990> get<00:07:19.080> rid<00:07:19.170> of<00:07:19.230> my<00:07:19.350> hair<00:07:19.530> I've<00:07:19.950> wasted
