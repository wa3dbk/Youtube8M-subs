00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:08.139
 just look at the sky we see that each 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.900
 day there are more and more constructions that 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:13.750
 raise the construction boom will 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:17.050
 they say one day there is nothing to the other 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:19.749
 Kate when they built this it costs 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.980
 realize but the country is being 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:23.600
 transforming 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.670
 and not only by these renowned 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.670
 professionals that appear on the plates 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.570
 but for those other professionals of the 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.110
 construction that strive from the 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.110
 anonymity 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:55.670
 with daniel ruiz is talking 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.130
 because I have a chambita fernando 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.710
 I recommend 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.540
 yes daniel what you do things of 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.220
 carpentry of different jobs but 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.850
 first I wanted to know how old you are 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.850
 as a carpenter 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.580
 carpentry 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.970
 his father was a carpenter and it was so 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.890
 he also liked the job since the 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.010
 child always accompanied him everywhere 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.930
 today he knows the importance of his 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:28.270
 work changed the squads the 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:30.790
 crossbars the benches for existed good 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.200
 conditions for tourism but he 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.710
 also makes spare parts and maintenance 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.410
 here historical areas even restored in 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.050
 the municipal library of huanchaco and 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.450
 perhaps someone congratulates him for that is 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.630
 probably not 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.060
 It is as henry vallejo tells us the 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.799
 people come to see the show the 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.049
 waters and stays with that you eat 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.729
 only not but does not know all the 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:57.240
 human effort all human work 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.240
 that I working 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.540
 henry is 30 years old since 4 years ago 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.450
 that fitr and today is responsible for giving 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.610
 maintenance to the water park is 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.130
 responsible that the pipes and valves 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.580
 keys are in perfect condition 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.560
 my greatest reward of mine is that everything 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.600
 tailor all knew well that people 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.610
 leave happy calm your house have it 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.590
 spent a nice moment in family and if 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.150
 everything goes well or in the best way I 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.650
 I go quickly to my house talking to 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.870
 family that what I love most in life 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.819
 Mario also thinks about people when 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.000
 he talks about his work he is a painter 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:36.790
 fat brush for 21 years clear 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.079
 work itself changes the life to the 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.250
 people that is in fact because 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:45.030
 apart from that the city's most beautiful most 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.130
 prettier 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.069
 He is from Lima but came to Lambayeque 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.020
 makes a chambita as he says but 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.840
 Of course, that chambita was painting the museum 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.730
 real tombs of Sipán that was helped 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.000
 transform ancestral relics 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.650
 in a major tourist attraction that was 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.340
 12 years ago and today he maintains 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.319
 to the museum 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.760
 in the limbo of worked in the in the 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:12.500
 hotel marriott at mcdonald de san miguel 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.470
 apart from larcomar in the stadium 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.379
 monumental of the uv and in the house at 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.209
 English as well as they many others 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:23.060
 professionals are responsible for 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.950
 master the concrete join metals give 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.900
 way to wood that electricity 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.480
 reach all the floors that the water 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.740
 reaches everywhere and nobody gets to 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.960
 think about that 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.210
 the clearest example is when you 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.910
 deliver departments only think of 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.780
 receive the keys and live in the 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.000
 we start the light switch 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.070
 we plug in the TV we use the 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.220
 microwave we bathe we close the 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:49.290
 door we close the windows and we do not 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.420
 we realize that all this was done by 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.540
 a construction specialist for 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:57.270
 that we can enjoy now 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.250
 let's meet jose he is in charge of 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.500
 electrical maintenance of the mirador de 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.510

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.630
 electricity to new towns like san 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:09.300

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:12.390
 that you or to be with a candle and that 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.710
 I have to plant the posts and put a 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.500
 tree that I have so that at least 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:19.600

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.270
 of satisfaction and joy 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:27.430
 unless I have those people that I have 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:29.410
 when you put the light on and it comes out like that 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.530

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.030

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:59.920
 tribute 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:03.220
 without them the country would not grow and 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:05.980

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:09.090
