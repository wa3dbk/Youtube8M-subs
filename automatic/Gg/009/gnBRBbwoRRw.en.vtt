00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.560
 good morning friends 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.809
 chicken in sweet and sour sauce is not about 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.550
 myself i'm talking about what we will today 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.860
 cook yes I have chicken fillet 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.800
 I remind you that each of our today's 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.180
 every morning of ours 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.189
 marked by some kind of cooking 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.990
 interesting dishes and today just 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.080
 try to cook the very chicken 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.939
 I cut it into thin straw as much as possible 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.689
 subtly as I get the 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.430
 more that look in the morning do not want the same 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:35.730
 to be distracted from important matters, such as 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.210
 brushing teeth washing charge and stuff 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.250
 other 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.550
 so you know how it goes 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.890
 it is well the only thing that I tell you 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.570
 wish when you collect something 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.239
 cooking is not just about breakfast 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.250
 Generally please focus on that 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.420
 what will you do and then you for sure 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.510
 will cook with joy usually 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.680
 the vast majority of people cook 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.469
 just to eat 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.960
 wrong need to cook in order 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:08.340
 to have fun and joy 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:16.350
 so chopped chicken breast is poured 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:19.790
 soy sauce a little pepper will continue 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.790
 cooking this dish 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:28.500
 fine slightly-slightly just mix 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:32.130
 make the whole chicken dip soy sauce 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:36.630
 Everything is fine now turn on God 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:39.540
 here we send wine vinegar the same 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:45.480
 most soy sauce only in small 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:47.340
 amount of tomato paste and tomato 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.860
 I see pasta two tea 2 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.300
 tablespoons and most likely here 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.610
 there will be another tablespoon of sugar 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.710
 all this should get warm and 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.380
 become not only sour but sweet and odd 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:06.960
 I'm afraid that a lot of chest is good and 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:11.540
 immediately see our task file 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:15.240
 there is such a wonderful 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:18.540
 bell pepper bell pepper 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:23.010
 well we cut it arbitrarily I love long 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:25.290
 strips so here so i will do 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.650
 in fact, I know that's said, 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.650
 now 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.670
 and caught myself thinking that it was not a fact that I 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.670
 all the time I will love 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.989
 long stripes the thing is cooking 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.459
 it's so situational 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.470
 discipline today you like one thing 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.330
 tomorrow will not like another fact 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.470
 that you will always love the same thing 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:49.140
 but meanwhile listen to your 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.820
 desires must be here 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:55.230
 see me starting here is easy 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.270
 tossing the matter is what's here yet 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.840
 it would be nice to add some water in order 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.610
 so that all this is extinguished yes in order to 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.770
 all our vegetables that will add a 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.840
 there are not too many of them and the bar is Bulgarian 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:11.980
 pepper and which can already be discussed and 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:15.159
 send tomato pepper 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:18.760
 but still left to send is not 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:20.799
 shy and tomato bend here 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.930
 generally very little but anyway 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:26.319
 know the greens I still add because 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:30.220
 that I always like it in any way 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:31.930
 and boiled them and they are very boiled I his 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.900
 add with great pleasure at the end 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.670
 preparations and in general then only 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.049
 starting to cook in every way 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.480
 it depends on what you want 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:48.129
 get at the output so look means 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:51.879
 Tomato we add too and still 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:53.709
 add pieces of them quite a bit 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:56.739
 but I think that this amount is quite 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:59.109
 it will be enough that there is more 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:02.220
 such a dish as rather not a dish 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:03.660
 ingredient pineapple slices 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:09.760
 canned pineapple 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:13.239
 juice is almost excluded and the whole thing is between 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.459
 and it goes right and left with 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.989
 maximum temperature included with 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.820
 maximum temperature in order to 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.430
 all this as it should if you suddenly 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.630
 It seems that something is missing necessary 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:27.010
 for example in the camp in this case, you can 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:30.210
 add moisture and wait until all 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:35.250
 get ready at this time I need 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:38.560
 fry in a little oil 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.330
 chicken I'll do it in just a minute 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.970
 friends, I remind you that I always 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.669
 limited time but think 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:49.750
 that nothing terrible I for sure 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:52.570
 I'll make it all chicken I fry the sauce with us 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.820
 actually ready to try soon 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.340
 as soon as the chicken 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:05:00.280
 get a finished look 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:05.080
 let's put it all together and try 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:07.720
 be sure to try soon can not wait 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.729
 friends try honest word not you 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.150
 you probably understand that all of mine 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:13.800
 preparations ended with me 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.990
 I love chicken 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.810
 Mixed sauce house a little stand 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:23.800
 it's literally a minute and now 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:28.210
 I enjoy only those times 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:31.840
 sweet and sour sauce happened but not 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:41.169
 Asian is incredibly happy because 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:42.870
 I would not like to repeat in the morning 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:45.419
 when you can't climb anything 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:48.160
 here it will be the best option 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:49.720
 try again and i'm sure you will 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.620
 enjoy everything you need with you 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.620
 see you bye
