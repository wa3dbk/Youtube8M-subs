pretty<00:02:16.230> good<00:02:16.500> with<00:02:16.709> these<00:02:16.830> type<00:02:17.069> of<00:02:17.100> cars<00:02:17.459> you

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
pretty good with these type of cars you

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.790 
pretty good with these type of cars you
don't<00:02:18.480> have<00:02:18.690> to<00:02:18.840> add<00:02:18.930> a<00:02:18.959> lot<00:02:19.170> of<00:02:19.200> extra<00:02:19.350> bars

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
don't have to add a lot of extra bars

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.640 
don't have to add a lot of extra bars
and<00:02:20.010> gives<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.250> rigidity<00:02:20.519> that<00:02:20.970> it<00:02:21.120> needs<00:02:21.650> we

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
and gives the rigidity that it needs we

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.050 
and gives the rigidity that it needs we
incorporated<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.450> outrigger<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.989> a<00:02:25.019> piece<00:02:25.319> of

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
incorporated the outrigger to a piece of

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.360 
incorporated the outrigger to a piece of
1/8<00:02:27.060> plate<00:02:27.420> welded<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:27.959> the<00:02:27.989> rocker<00:02:28.260> panel<00:02:28.800> and

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
1/8 plate welded to the rocker panel and

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.090 
1/8 plate welded to the rocker panel and
then<00:02:30.000> I<00:02:30.030> made<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.810> main<00:02:30.989> loop<00:02:31.230> connect<00:02:31.709> off<00:02:31.890> of

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
then I made the main loop connect off of

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.570 
then I made the main loop connect off of
this<00:02:32.870> and<00:02:33.870> then<00:02:34.080> this<00:02:34.230> will<00:02:34.410> be<00:02:34.470> your<00:02:34.769> number

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
this and then this will be your number

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.130 
this and then this will be your number
15<00:02:36.060> lower<00:02:36.269> horizontal<00:02:37.049> lower<00:02:37.489> gage<00:02:38.489> support

15 lower horizontal lower gage support

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.940 
15 lower horizontal lower gage support
so<00:02:40.140> we'll<00:02:40.830> connect<00:02:41.160> this<00:02:41.690> with<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.950> other

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
so we'll connect this with the other

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.400 
so we'll connect this with the other
directional<00:02:44.940> up-and-down<00:02:45.450> bar<00:02:45.780> here<00:02:46.079> on<00:02:46.110> both

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
directional up-and-down bar here on both

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.900 
directional up-and-down bar here on both
sides<00:02:46.739> and<00:02:46.950> we'll<00:02:47.100> start<00:02:47.370> building<00:02:47.489> a<00:02:47.700> funny

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
sides and we'll start building a funny

00:02:47.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
sides and we'll start building a funny
car<00:02:48.150> gage<00:02:48.420> do<00:02:48.690> it

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.940 

statue<00:03:17.800> limitations<00:03:18.160> are<00:03:18.879> out<00:03:19.890> how<00:03:20.890> many

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
statue limitations are out how many

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.640 
statue limitations are out how many

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
liberties did you take with that car by

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.390 
liberties did you take with that car by
the<00:03:23.709> rulebook<00:03:24.450> liberties<00:03:25.980> did<00:03:26.980> you<00:03:27.129> stretch

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
the rulebook liberties did you stretch

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.309 
the rulebook liberties did you stretch
the<00:03:27.730> rulebook<00:03:27.970> was<00:03:28.420> there<00:03:28.599> any<00:03:28.780> kind<00:03:29.019> of<00:03:29.110> gray

the rulebook was there any kind of gray

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:31.380 
the rulebook was there any kind of gray
area<00:03:29.860> and<00:03:30.099> I'll<00:03:30.250> show<00:03:30.519> you<00:03:30.550> one<00:03:30.910> up<00:03:31.090> if<00:03:31.269> you

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.569 
advantage I got enough bill either one
but<00:03:55.180> I<00:03:55.360> need<00:03:55.420> to<00:03:55.630> build<00:03:55.750> me<00:03:55.900> a<00:03:55.930> cheater<00:03:56.260> was<00:03:56.620> so

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
but I need to build me a cheater was so

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:59.940 
but I need to build me a cheater was so
I<00:03:57.640> built<00:03:57.940> I<00:03:58.060> took<00:03:58.299> me<00:03:58.480> a<00:03:58.510> thrill<00:03:58.959> to<00:03:59.260> crack<00:03:59.590> and

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
I built I took me a thrill to crack and

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.890 
I built I took me a thrill to crack and
I'd<00:04:00.040> be<00:04:00.250> stroked<00:04:00.640> at<00:04:00.819> hundred<00:04:01.209> on<00:04:01.329> one<00:04:01.629> side

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
I'd be stroked at hundred on one side

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.780 
I'd be stroked at hundred on one side
and<00:04:02.230> Stroke<00:04:02.769> to<00:04:03.010> the<00:04:03.099> hundred<00:04:03.430> on<00:04:03.579> the<00:04:03.670> other

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
and Stroke to the hundred on the other
