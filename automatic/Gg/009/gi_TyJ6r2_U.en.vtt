00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
have been a crumb she said I think she

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.110 
have been a crumb she said I think she
loves<00:00:58.319> being<00:00:58.649> up<00:00:58.920> there<00:00:59.249> like<00:00:59.639> up<00:00:59.850> in<00:01:00.030> the

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.520 
loves being up there like up in the
clouds<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.780> don't<00:01:00.839> think<00:01:01.019> she<00:01:01.229> wants<00:01:01.469> to

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
clouds and I don't think she wants to

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.299 
clouds and I don't think she wants to
come<00:01:01.829> down<00:01:02.749> so<00:01:03.749> so<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.260> lot<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.680> girls<00:01:04.920> got<00:01:05.100> very

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
come down so so a lot of girls got very

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.399 
come down so so a lot of girls got very
used<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:06.119> extra<00:01:06.570> height<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.079> they<00:01:07.229> got

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
used to that extra height that they got

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.090 
used to that extra height that they got
with<00:01:07.530> them<00:01:07.939> my<00:01:08.939> hunch<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:10.469> that<00:01:10.860> it's

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
with them my hunch is that is that it's

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.160 
with them my hunch is that is that it's
going<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.460> be<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.450> it's<00:01:12.630> just<00:01:12.899> gonna<00:01:13.020> be

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
going to be that that it's just gonna be

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.190 
going to be that that it's just gonna be
just<00:01:13.200> part<00:01:13.649> of<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.310> mix<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.820> all<00:01:15.719> the
