really excited about it I have always

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.099 
really excited about it I have always
looked<00:00:16.230> on<00:00:16.440> like<00:00:16.500> HCG<00:00:17.460> results<00:00:18.090> before<00:00:18.930> and

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
looked on like HCG results before and

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.750 
looked on like HCG results before and
after<00:00:19.410> pictures<00:00:19.740> of<00:00:19.890> people<00:00:20.220> I<00:00:20.340> just<00:00:20.550> really

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
after pictures of people I just really

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.609 
after pictures of people I just really
enjoy<00:00:21.060> seeing<00:00:21.420> people<00:00:21.510> progress<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:22.380> get<00:00:22.500> to

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
enjoy seeing people progress and get to

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.620 
enjoy seeing people progress and get to
where<00:00:22.710> they<00:00:22.830> want<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.880> inspires<00:00:24.330> me<00:00:24.449> to

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
where they want and it inspires me to

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.950 
where they want and it inspires me to
reach<00:00:24.930> my<00:00:24.960> personal<00:00:25.680> goals<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.099> so<00:00:26.570> I<00:00:27.570> thought

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
reach my personal goals and so I thought

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.720 
reach my personal goals and so I thought
that<00:00:28.140> it'd<00:00:28.260> be<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.410> cool<00:00:28.680> idea<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:28.980> kind<00:00:29.670> of

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
that it'd be a cool idea to kind of

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.470 
that it'd be a cool idea to kind of
document<00:00:30.410> the<00:00:31.410> achievements<00:00:31.830> that<00:00:31.890> I'm<00:00:32.130> doing

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
document the achievements that I'm doing

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.470 
document the achievements that I'm doing
starting<00:00:33.480> HCG<00:00:34.260> I've<00:00:34.800> done<00:00:35.130> HCG<00:00:35.520> before<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.059> did

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
just like me may also be searching for

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.160 
just like me may also be searching for
HCG<00:01:26.670> results<00:01:27.090> if<00:01:27.210> you've<00:01:27.360> ever<00:01:27.540> decided<00:01:28.049> if

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
HCG results if you've ever decided if

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.249 
HCG results if you've ever decided if
you<00:01:28.290> want<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.560> do<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.970> I<00:01:29.970> know<00:01:30.689> it's<00:01:30.930> kind<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.170> a

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
you want to do it I know it's kind of a

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.340 
you want to do it I know it's kind of a
controversial<00:01:31.740> thing<00:01:32.869> but<00:01:33.869> I've<00:01:33.960> known<00:01:34.200> lots

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
controversial thing but I've known lots

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.830 
controversial thing but I've known lots
of<00:01:34.470> people<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:34.829> have<00:01:34.890> done<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.840> they've

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
of people that have done it and they've

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.749 
of people that have done it and they've
lost<00:01:37.140> incredible<00:01:37.890> amounts<00:01:38.159> away<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.670> they

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
lost incredible amounts away and they

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.069 
lost incredible amounts away and they
look<00:01:38.939> great<00:01:39.140> I<00:01:40.140> think<00:01:41.130> with<00:01:42.000> HCG<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:42.689> know<00:01:42.869> for

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
look great I think with HCG I know for

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.990 
look great I think with HCG I know for
me<00:01:43.229> this<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:44.009> only<00:01:44.159> way<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.700> lose

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
me this is the only way that I lose

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.630 
me this is the only way that I lose
weight<00:01:45.680> in<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.740> amount<00:01:47.009> of<00:01:47.040> time<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.399> I<00:01:47.430> want

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
weight in the amount of time that I want

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.940 
weight in the amount of time that I want
to<00:01:47.759> in<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.880> very<00:01:48.060> impatient<00:01:48.329> person<00:01:48.829> so<00:01:49.829> I've

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
to in a very impatient person so I've

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.260 
to in a very impatient person so I've
done<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.220> whole<00:01:50.369> eating<00:01:50.729> healthy<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.149> like

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
done the whole eating healthy and like

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.289 
done the whole eating healthy and like
working<00:01:51.659> out<00:01:51.810> but<00:01:52.110> HCG<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:53.610> something<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.180> we

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
working out but HCG is something that we

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.020 
working out but HCG is something that we
get<00:01:54.540> results<00:01:54.899> quick<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.729> surprisingly<00:01:56.729> the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
get results quick and surprisingly the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.969 
get results quick and surprisingly the
amount<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.479> food<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.380> can<00:01:58.530> have<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:58.799> know

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
amount of food that you can have I know

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.490 
amount of food that you can have I know
it's<00:01:59.159> low-calorie<00:02:00.170> but<00:02:01.170> you're<00:02:01.320> actually

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
it's low-calorie but you're actually

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.160
