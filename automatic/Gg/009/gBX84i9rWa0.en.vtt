00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 I am efrén vázquez moto driver 3 and my 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.180
 challenge this year is to be constant in all 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.069
 the careers of a new category like 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.320
 is 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.500
 when you get to the track and put on the 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.119
 helmet you put on your overalls like you are 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.800
 the driving that I have because I do not know if 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:19.500
 because maybe the stature the span 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.599
 that I have does not obligate me or to 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.520
 advantage not the aggressive leader with the motorbike 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.890
 and I always tend to always look for 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.170
 a line a little thinner more stable 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.519
 you have to know what you have to be in 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.830
 the right moment and you're not having 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.980
 good luck with the bike some falls if 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.050
 you come down you're lost they say that 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.640
 to become a great champion because 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.780
 many times it starts with defeat yes 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.629
 that it is true that we are having bad 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.120
 lucky but both I and the team like 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.800
 the people that the sponsors and 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.390
 all the people that surround our team 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.890
 because a lot of work has been done and how much 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.750
 it's more difficult for you to get somewhere 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.410
 when you get it you always know 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.060
 best 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.620
 you have some kind of ritual before 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.060
 get on the bike before the races 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.770
 of the time to put my boots on 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.930
 put on my gloves to put on my helmet 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.910
 small things the hotels for example 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.920
 I like to sleep always on the side of the 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.720
 window already arrives sometimes maybe in 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.340
 obsessed but they say it 's very good 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.140
 also have a routine something that gives you 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.650
 luck even if you take with you I come from 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.360
 a family with Galician roots of that 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.180
 tradition of meigas and good logically 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.680
 there are little things that are done that are 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.970
 that they take but that I can not tell you 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.190
 I 'll show you a little 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.020
 the box where mechanics are spoken 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.060
 working the first one that you have 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.590
 so on two wheels I was on the bike without 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.210
 rollers with two years and still not 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.610
 I was walking from being on a couch at home and 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.130
 watch careers at six in the morning 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.380
 that always ran in Japan and my 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.690
 father woke me up from kid and I 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.360
 took to the couch to watch the other races 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.800
 he will say this for nothing without thinking that 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.930
 was going to get to the world championship to 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.930
 me this is almost a salary do not live every 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.030
 This is going to be unpayable with the passage 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.950
 of the years now we go to the truck in the 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:00.060
 part where we change before leaving 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.049
 and these two things of occupation yes good 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.899
 surely one of the most monkeys 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.579
 small of the grill yes hitting me with 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:11.039
 danny with tone yet you have left to go 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:14.040
 to fish the monkey but good 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.900
 because I have a problem with the boots 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.540
 of the motorcycle because I have to do 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.909
 I had always used the 39 but 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.409
 use a 37 and good at the time I 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:25.439
 they made some boots that came to my foot 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:28.140
 it was wonderful to have here part 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:30.030
 of the colors and the flag that of my 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.430
 land that you would say is the best of your 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.109
 profession to savor it that what has 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.319
 side and get somewhere and when 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:38.790
 you get it then the moment of the breast of 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.720
 emphasis of the whole team celebrating 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.510
 and the worst 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.670
 man I think there are many days like 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.440
 I say between meals and talking badly about 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.450
 shit and spoon you have an injury and 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.160
 you're done dust on the bed dragging 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.050
 it's a race another career what 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.760
 resulting people arrive that sometimes 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.980
 he slaps you on the back when you 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.260
 you do well disappears you say I'm alone 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.360
 worse because you realize where what 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.730
 is this and what is an athlete that 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.890
 it is an object that monopolizes a lot of attention 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.540
 but when it ceases to be the center of 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.130
 attention because many times each time they fall 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.600
 in oblivion tranquility to people who 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.820
 I know you are there behind and that I 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.500
 you support that although it costs us we are going to 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.240
 be there really that feelings 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.520
 mine is that this year is going to be a nice 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.880
 year and we will be able to fight to be very 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.880
 ahead 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.130
 cool
