00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.730
 going great we are on gta 5 for 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:23.240
 the challenge number one two mast chain for 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.130
 this first challenge we will try to 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.570
 to realize the Cuban challenge to rooms so 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.070
 for those who do not know this 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.300
 youtuber the link of his chain will be in 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.279
 the description of the video 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.000
 so the goal of the challenge is going to be everything 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:38.120
 to just call a cab that comes 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.470
 just pick me up here and so I placed 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.680
 a little landmarks on the tablecloth that is 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.640
 here and here I am here so I 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.840
 will call this axis he will come to me 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.059
 search on the highway from 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.559
 finally leave around what and I 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.270
 tell him to go to the landmarks 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.309
 so he'll go through there by the part 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.620
 one is normally here he should 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.210
 take a left and that's road he goes 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.590
 so he'll take this route and this 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.910
 road is a road is the road to 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.960
 hell clearly because if you 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.879
 want to play taxis I'll tell him 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.020
 to speed up and this road know this is 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.210
 the mountain roads to which are 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.590
 all the other three and so he goes 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.759
 accelerate thoroughly and the goal is 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.740
 to arrive as far as possible and seen 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.929
 that it is a NPC that drives risk 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.310
 easy to count and well the challenge 

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:14.710
 will be missed is a little the goal of a challenge 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.549
 also be it successful or failed 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.869
 here's the goal is to go further 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:18.200
 possible then the youtube hours the 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.119
 room 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.430
 if I say no nonsense he got to 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.509
 about here I think I do not want to 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.189
 underestimate but if I say no 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.439
 nonsense it was finally coming from 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.150
 the less he did not succeed the challenge is 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.100
 beautiful goal is to go of course the most 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.810
 far possible or even to succeed at 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.610
 know that there is a one in ten chance that 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.770
 I succeed and what not only wants 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.259
 me but that everyone knows that if 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.310
 you face if you do the challenge 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.270
 you have a one in ten chance for the 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.460
 succeed so it's very very little 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.750
 chances are very low so here we go 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.009
 so after I encourage you to do it 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.210
 this challenge if you are south tube hours and 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.979
 all that you can even with your friends 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.960
 what amuse you all that it can be 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.250
 fun finally good it's gone I was typing 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:59.240

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.240

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.850

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.879
 the forest a robbery that's con 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.269
 so I hope it will not do a thousand 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:18.080
 Once damage is 7:24 it 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.459
 it's a pity 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.879
 I should also think about 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:25.250

 a weapon is taken over by as a 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.269
 tarlouze 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:56.260
 nothing more complicated good listening and I 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.260
 quickly reminded my taxi month 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.950
 it's a file what does it mean 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.670
 fucking in the media 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.670
 Archos 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.800
 wait he returns 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.330
 she without messing around 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.540
 you have I'm disgusted what sadia buggy 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.540
 what 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.990
 he is coming 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.990
 my coach and the lega 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:32.950
 by cons you said you love breaks crushed 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:36.100
 press and I support 1st fucking star 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.390
 it's not at s1 to let me go 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.280
 I'm going to cut the music 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.050
 here 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.400
 and of course I will liger accelerate in 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.110
 pressing square here is where he goes 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.200
 to go rather fast so there for the least 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.250
 he follows the road simply I'm going 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.720
 not put in first person has nothing 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.890
 to see so there to have he follows the 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.060
 road you saw he goes fast enough 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.190
 anyway so I already have a door to 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.480
 rachida it's cool but normally at the 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.370
 next intersection so not this one 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.070
 but the other here he'll take a left 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.180
 so here it is going to take a left so 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.650
 you will see that from there down it 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.300
 is going to be a hell because that road 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.190
 is the six had these two roads of 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.020
 campaign and for us the players it's going 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.520
 we are not secret and for the NPCs 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.160
 go super fast in it's death 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.680
 clearly it's death for them when 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.560
 Hopefully it will 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.000
 are you okay or damn it's okay he's doing it 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.930
 did not crush them call phase i 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.160
 who painted them rabbits pardon 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.229
 until then everything is fine so the youtube 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.340
 hours the room here the fair is the challenge 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:28.289
 from there because actually its 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.880
 car and the end barrel is the same me 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:31.110
 I almost made a barrel too 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.310

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.780

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.639
 a the driver gets out of the car he gets 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.160
 running bar so here I am I 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:43.440
 managed to pass this place by cons 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:46.710
 there each gently gently taxi him 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:50.490
 fight the balls a weight he 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.449
 stop there is a rabbit okay but 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.430

 Alice down the balls if you have 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.199

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.220
 quickly to flat illegal taxes 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:10.139
 for the moment everything is fine though 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:14.639

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:16.349

 first parade at most on my 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:34.219

 few here we are, we managed the challenge 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.080
 you guys I have a star I do not know 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.450
 why I have a star I have not 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.290
 understood why I had a star 

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.370
 here are the guys we managed this challenge but 

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.900
 good it's a pleasure a bit the first 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.330
 challenge so honestly I encourage you 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.250

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.120
 that he is really nice after I 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.620
 forgot to tell you that this video 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.880
 could last three minutes just like 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.590
 it can last thirty seconds because 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.150
 that in fact it does not depend on us actually 

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.160
 it depends on the taxi actually because 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.600
 this is me it's not me who am strong 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.160
 here it is rather the taxi for the shot 

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.200
 but hey it's a challenge like any other 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.400
 so here for me it was realized 

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.050
