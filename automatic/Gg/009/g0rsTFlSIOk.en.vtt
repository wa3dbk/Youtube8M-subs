here<00:02:32.360> I'll<00:02:33.260> show<00:02:33.500> you<00:02:33.530> this<00:02:33.740> like<00:02:33.980> what<00:02:34.250> the

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
here I'll show you this like what the

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.170 
here I'll show you this like what the
bulb<00:02:34.610> is<00:02:34.910> besides<00:02:35.600> the<00:02:35.840> packaging<00:02:37.180> there's

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
bulb is besides the packaging there's

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.110 
bulb is besides the packaging there's
not<00:02:38.360> much<00:02:38.600> to<00:02:38.900> it<00:02:39.080> there's<00:02:39.890> obviously<00:02:40.070> LED<00:02:40.880> in

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
not much to it there's obviously LED in

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.620 
not much to it there's obviously LED in
there<00:02:41.360> electronic<00:02:42.170> chip<00:02:42.610> so<00:02:43.610> be<00:02:43.850> it<00:02:44.060> but<00:02:44.330> here

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
there electronic chip so be it but here

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.050

it would be the connectors like you

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.650 
it would be the connectors like you
would<00:02:48.770> connect<00:02:49.130> on<00:02:49.340> plug<00:02:49.850> in<00:02:50.030> for<00:02:50.300> a<00:02:50.330> normal
