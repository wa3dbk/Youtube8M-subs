00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.040 
I've been wanting to do this for a long
time<00:00:48.930> just<00:00:49.559> as<00:00:49.649> kind<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:49.920> see<00:00:50.750> you<00:00:51.750> know<00:00:51.780> what

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
time just as kind of see you know what

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.660 
time just as kind of see you know what
these<00:00:52.199> guys<00:00:52.260> did<00:00:52.739> because<00:00:53.070> they're<00:00:53.280> always<00:00:53.489> in

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
these guys did because they're always in

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.220 
these guys did because they're always in
the<00:00:53.789> garden<00:00:54.239> they<00:00:54.420> don't<00:00:54.600> seem<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.930> bother

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230

the garden they don't seem to bother
anything<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.570> just<00:00:57.840> figured<00:00:58.140> they've

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
anything and so I just figured they've

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.020 
anything and so I just figured they've
gotta<00:00:58.590> be<00:00:58.710> good<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.250> know<00:00:59.340> similar<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.910> the

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
kind of like this straw and the leaf

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.370 
kind of like this straw and the leaf
material<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.060> from<00:02:00.659> where<00:02:00.810> they<00:02:00.930> were<00:02:00.990> already

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
material is from where they were already

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.670 
material is from where they were already
living<00:02:02.479> and<00:02:03.479> then<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.810> newspaper<00:02:04.350> here<00:02:04.649> I

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
living and then the newspaper here I

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.810 
living and then the newspaper here I
folded<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.310> up<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.549> few<00:02:05.759> times<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:06.420> just

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
folded it up a few times and I just

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.020 
folded it up a few times and I just
choked<00:02:06.970> it<00:02:07.150> in<00:02:07.270> water<00:02:07.540> and<00:02:08.140> I<00:02:09.009> did<00:02:09.880> that

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
choked it in water and I did that

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.690 
choked it in water and I did that
because<00:02:10.179> whatever<00:02:10.899> I<00:02:11.110> see<00:02:11.500> these<00:02:11.800> guys<00:02:12.070> in<00:02:12.130> my

worm composting stuff you know in that

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.070 
worm composting stuff you know in that
bin<00:03:08.830> we'll<00:03:09.190> see<00:03:09.430> but<00:03:10.239> uh<00:03:10.300> yeah<00:03:10.660> we'll<00:03:10.840> see<00:03:11.019> how

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
bin we'll see but uh yeah we'll see how

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.870 
bin we'll see but uh yeah we'll see how
it<00:03:11.170> goes<00:03:11.200> and<00:03:11.620> then<00:03:11.950> they<00:03:12.400> don't<00:03:12.489> seem<00:03:12.700> to<00:03:12.790> be

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
it goes and then they don't seem to be

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.820 
it goes and then they don't seem to be
able<00:03:13.030> to<00:03:13.150> get<00:03:13.330> up<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:13.660> side<00:03:13.900> so<00:03:14.200> it's<00:03:14.620> really

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
able to get up the side so it's really

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:15.479 
able to get up the side so it's really
soft

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
soft

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.270 
soft
or<00:03:15.820> really<00:03:16.150> slippery<00:03:16.510> but<00:03:17.470> if<00:03:17.560> they<00:03:17.680> do<00:03:17.980> I

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
or really slippery but if they do I

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.280 
or really slippery but if they do I
might<00:03:19.209> I'll<00:03:19.390> just<00:03:19.570> go<00:03:19.720> ahead<00:03:19.810> and<00:03:20.019> throw<00:03:20.049> some

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
might I'll just go ahead and throw some

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.610 
might I'll just go ahead and throw some
window<00:03:21.250> screen<00:03:21.580> hot<00:03:21.880> glue<00:03:22.120> it<00:03:22.299> around<00:03:23.260> these

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
window screen hot glue it around these

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.780 
window screen hot glue it around these
holes<00:03:24.450> so<00:03:25.560> that's<00:03:26.560> it<00:03:26.950> for<00:03:27.160> a<00:03:27.220> Rollie<00:03:27.489> pollie

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
holes so that's it for a Rollie pollie

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.090 
holes so that's it for a Rollie pollie
farm<00:03:28.090> we'll<00:03:28.930> keep<00:03:29.110> you<00:03:29.260> updated<00:03:29.410> on<00:03:29.829> how<00:03:29.980> it
