by<00:00:34.790> air<00:00:35.790> use<00:00:39.860> this<00:00:40.860> mission<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.430> quite<00:00:42.090> easy<00:00:42.620> I

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
by air use this mission is quite easy I

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.990 
by air use this mission is quite easy I
didn't<00:00:44.370> die<00:00:44.579> which<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.379> very<00:00:46.379> good<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:47.670> we<00:00:47.879> have

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
didn't die which is very good so we have

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.510 
didn't die which is very good so we have
a<00:00:48.030> very<00:00:48.329> clean<00:00:48.719> edit<00:00:52.129> not<00:00:53.129> really<00:00:53.340> much<00:00:53.460> else

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
a very clean edit not really much else

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.549 
a very clean edit not really much else
not<00:00:54.090> much<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.449> say<00:00:54.660> until<00:00:54.870> we<00:00:55.140> get<00:00:55.289> into<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
not much to say until we get into the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.810 
not much to say until we get into the
action<00:00:55.920> here<00:00:59.510> this<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.690> similar<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.109> the

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
action here this is similar to the

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.340 
action here this is similar to the
mission<00:01:02.820> where<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.059> have<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.270> destroy<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.930> 10

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
mission where you have to destroy the 10

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.490 
mission where you have to destroy the 10
viral<00:01:04.830> detectors<00:01:05.390> except<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.750> 10<00:01:07.229> times

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
viral detectors except this is 10 times

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.810 
viral detectors except this is 10 times
easier<00:01:07.770> because<00:01:08.100> now<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.430> can<00:01:08.549> use

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
easier because now you can use

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.530 
easier because now you can use
helicopters<00:01:09.229> um<00:01:10.549> if<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.700> have<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.970> air<00:01:12.180> blade

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
helicopters um if you have the air blade

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.690 
helicopters um if you have the air blade
slice<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.830> what<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.010> did<00:01:14.100> for<00:01:14.400> like<00:01:14.549> the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
slice this is what I did for like the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.330 
slice this is what I did for like the
first<00:01:14.909> two<00:01:15.600> or<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:15.960> he'll<00:01:16.830> take<00:01:17.009> him<00:01:17.159> out<00:01:17.250> in

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
first two or so he'll take him out in

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
first two or so he'll take him out in
one<00:01:17.520> hit<00:01:19.340> then<00:01:20.340> after<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.759> was<00:01:21.000> just<00:01:21.060> doing

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
one hit then after that I was just doing

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.999 
one hit then after that I was just doing
hit<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.780> runs<00:01:21.960> but<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.320> found<00:01:22.560> an<00:01:22.710> easier

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
hit and runs but I found an easier

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.240 
hit and runs but I found an easier
technique<00:01:23.430> later<00:01:23.670> on<00:01:24.710> just<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.799> say<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.040> little

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
technique later on just to say a little

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.719 
technique later on just to say a little
bit<00:01:26.430> something<00:01:28.340> people<00:01:29.340> have<00:01:29.460> been<00:01:29.520> telling

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
bit something people have been telling

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.300 
bit something people have been telling
me<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.000> no<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.570> need<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.049> beat<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.290> on<00:01:31.409> normal

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
me that no you need to beat it on normal

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.950 
me that no you need to beat it on normal
to<00:01:32.640> unlock<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.210> need<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.479> be<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.659> uneasy

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
to unlock it you need to be the uneasy

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.469 
to unlock it you need to be the uneasy
okay<00:01:34.740> let's<00:01:35.009> just<00:01:35.130> say<00:01:35.430> because<00:01:35.820> I'm<00:01:36.180> getting

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
okay let's just say because I'm getting

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.990 
okay let's just say because I'm getting
a<00:01:36.540> lot<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.720> differently<00:01:37.290> mixed<00:01:37.829> answers<00:01:38.369> let's

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
a lot of differently mixed answers let's

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.810 
a lot of differently mixed answers let's
just<00:01:39.210> say<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:40.409> is<00:01:40.590> beat<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.549> on<00:01:41.610> normal

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
just say that it is beat it on normal

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.429 
just say that it is beat it on normal
even<00:01:42.390> on<00:01:42.479> normal<00:01:42.509> if<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:42.930> want<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.320> unlock

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
even on normal if you want to unlock

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.440 
even on normal if you want to unlock
hard<00:01:43.860> because<00:01:44.280> none<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.700> us<00:01:44.880> are<00:01:45.030> completely

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
hard because none of us are completely

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.399 
hard because none of us are completely
sure<00:01:47.360> so<00:01:48.360> hopefully<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:48.930> will<00:01:49.020> end<00:01:49.229> that

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
sure so hopefully that will end that

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.310 
sure so hopefully that will end that

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
a little bit of health saw that was on

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.180 
a little bit of health saw that was on
the<00:02:09.390> rooftop<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.080> ended<00:02:10.289> up<00:02:10.410> not<00:02:10.619> going<00:02:10.800> for

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
the rooftop so I ended up not going for

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:20.300 
the rooftop so I ended up not going for
it<00:02:11.310> but<00:02:17.450> if<00:02:18.450> you<00:02:18.720> don't<00:02:19.260> have<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:19.739> longshot

some<00:02:30.480> of<00:02:30.569> these<00:02:30.660> just<00:02:31.260> do<00:02:31.380> hit-and-runs<00:02:31.920> if

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
some of these just do hit-and-runs if

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.949 
some of these just do hit-and-runs if
you<00:02:32.220> want<00:02:32.400> to<00:02:32.489> use<00:02:32.580> your<00:02:32.700> air<00:02:32.849> blade<00:02:33.060> it's<00:02:33.780> much

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
you want to use your air blade it's much

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.090 
you want to use your air blade it's much
easier<00:02:33.989> to<00:02:34.410> use<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:34.920> helicopter<00:02:35.190> which<00:02:36.150> I<00:02:36.269> get

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
easier to use a helicopter which I get

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.860 
easier to use a helicopter which I get
later<00:02:38.100> on<00:02:39.769> just<00:02:40.769> do<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.010> full<00:02:41.370> charge<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:42.239> take

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
later on just do a full charge and take

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.920 
later on just do a full charge and take
them<00:02:43.049> out<00:02:44.180> all<00:02:45.180> right<00:02:45.330> there<00:02:45.540> wasn't<00:02:45.810> very

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
them out all right there wasn't very

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.680 
them out all right there wasn't very
nice<00:02:46.110> because<00:02:46.380> there<00:02:46.560> were<00:02:46.650> two<00:02:46.860> tanks<00:02:47.690> after

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
nice because there were two tanks after

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.059 
nice because there were two tanks after
you<00:02:48.810> destroy<00:02:49.110> your<00:02:49.260> second<00:02:49.620> one<00:02:49.709> you'll<00:02:49.860> get<00:02:50.040> a

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
you destroy your second one you'll get a

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.070 
you destroy your second one you'll get a
checkpoint<00:02:50.489> and<00:02:50.700> also<00:02:51.450> I<00:02:51.480> believe<00:02:51.569> after<00:02:51.870> you

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
checkpoint and also I believe after you

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.620 
checkpoint and also I believe after you
just<00:02:52.230> show<00:02:52.350> your<00:02:52.530> six<00:02:53.150> or<00:02:54.150> something<00:02:54.510> like

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
just show your six or something like

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:30.130 
just show your six or something like
that<00:02:54.690> so<00:02:55.319> it's<00:02:56.160> not<00:02:56.310> majorly<00:02:57.030> difficult

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.930 

we<00:03:31.140> have<00:03:31.230> another<00:03:31.440> read<00:03:31.710> my<00:03:31.890> team<00:03:32.610> three<00:03:32.910> is

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
we have another read my team three is

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:41.070 
we have another read my team three is
not<00:03:33.240> responding<00:03:33.690> either

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.350 

all<00:03:41.650> right<00:03:41.860> now<00:03:42.130> over<00:03:42.610> here<00:03:43.000> is<00:03:43.060> when<00:03:43.330> I

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
all right now over here is when I

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.670 
all right now over here is when I
started<00:03:43.450> to<00:03:45.030> use<00:03:46.030> helicopters<00:03:46.270> I<00:03:46.900> use<00:03:47.560> the

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
started to use helicopters I use the

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.610 
started to use helicopters I use the
longshot<00:03:48.130> grab<00:03:48.370> but<00:03:48.700> I<00:03:48.970> think<00:03:49.840> that<00:03:49.900> any<00:03:50.200> even

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
longshot grab but I think that any even

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.080 
longshot grab but I think that any even
if<00:03:50.650> you<00:03:50.740> don't<00:03:50.950> have<00:03:51.040> that<00:03:51.280> ability<00:03:51.400> it'll<00:03:51.910> be

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
if you don't have that ability it'll be

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.120 
if you don't have that ability it'll be
pretty<00:03:52.330> easy<00:03:52.450> to<00:03:52.810> get<00:03:53.020> onto<00:03:53.200> a<00:03:53.350> helicopter<00:03:53.560> at

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
pretty easy to get onto a helicopter at

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:01.260 
pretty easy to get onto a helicopter at
this<00:03:54.280> altitude

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:08.070 

what<00:04:02.270> is<00:04:02.420> latched<00:04:02.660> on

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.820 

you

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.160 

and<00:04:12.040> since<00:04:12.880> I'd<00:04:13.000> military<00:04:13.510> alert<00:04:13.660> all<00:04:13.900> I<00:04:13.930> had

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
and since I'd military alert all I had

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.410 
and since I'd military alert all I had
to<00:04:14.200> do<00:04:14.380> was<00:04:14.500> fly<00:04:14.710> up<00:04:14.770> to<00:04:14.860> the<00:04:15.040> very<00:04:15.160> or<00:04:15.760> just<00:04:16.239> fly

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.420 
to do was fly up to the very or just fly

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.560 
to do was fly up to the very or just fly
up<00:04:16.500> then<00:04:17.500> I<00:04:17.620> lost<00:04:17.799> it<00:04:18.130> for<00:04:19.120> taking<00:04:19.360> out<00:04:19.450> the

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
up then I lost it for taking out the

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.030 
up then I lost it for taking out the
viral<00:04:19.840> detectors<00:04:20.320> i<00:04:20.500> used<00:04:20.830> the<00:04:21.480> strongest

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
viral detectors i used the strongest

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.950 
viral detectors i used the strongest
ammunition<00:04:24.040> on<00:04:24.160> the<00:04:24.370> helicopter<00:04:24.730> the<00:04:25.240> will

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
ammunition on the helicopter the will

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.230 
ammunition on the helicopter the will
block<00:04:26.170> on<00:04:26.380> missiles<00:04:26.800> it<00:04:27.400> takes<00:04:27.670> off<00:04:27.820> the<00:04:27.940> viral

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
block on missiles it takes off the viral

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.300 
block on missiles it takes off the viral
protectors<00:04:28.720> and<00:04:28.870> two<00:04:28.990> hits<00:04:29.230> so<00:04:29.770> it<00:04:30.100> was<00:04:30.220> a<00:04:30.280> very

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
protectors and two hits so it was a very

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.720 
protectors and two hits so it was a very
good<00:04:30.610> choice<00:04:31.980> and<00:04:32.980> all<00:04:33.100> that's<00:04:33.220> left<00:04:33.430> for<00:04:33.550> this

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
good choice and all that's left for this

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.360 
good choice and all that's left for this
entire<00:04:34.210> mission<00:04:34.510> is<00:04:35.140> me<00:04:35.980> going<00:04:36.100> around

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
hitting them with the lock on missiles

hitting them with the lock on missiles
as<00:04:38.320> long<00:04:38.560> as<00:04:38.710> you<00:04:38.800> hit<00:04:38.980> it<00:04:39.070> in<00:04:39.250> two<00:04:39.490> good<00:04:39.850> hits
