and I guess he's got one of those cases

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.380 
and I guess he's got one of those cases
kind<00:02:23.160> of<00:02:23.220> like<00:02:23.370> this<00:02:23.580> where<00:02:23.970> you<00:02:24.030> have<00:02:24.120> to<00:02:24.210> like

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
kind of like this where you have to like

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.890 
kind of like this where you have to like
pry<00:02:24.750> them<00:02:24.900> out<00:02:25.020> of<00:02:25.170> there<00:02:26.120> like<00:02:27.120> prying<00:02:27.570> out<00:02:27.750> of

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
pry them out of there like prying out of

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.840 
pry them out of there like prying out of
there<00:02:28.020> and<00:02:28.230> it's<00:02:28.650> cracked<00:02:29.010> his<00:02:29.190> disc<00:02:29.460> a<00:02:29.640> little

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
there and it's cracked his disc a little

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.120 
there and it's cracked his disc a little
bit<00:02:30.000> that's<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:30.720> that's<00:02:31.440> not<00:02:31.680> good<00:02:31.860> folks

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
bit that's a that's not good folks

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.280 
bit that's a that's not good folks

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
push things like push down that doesn't

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.990 
push things like push down that doesn't
sound<00:03:19.830> good<00:03:20.010> when<00:03:20.220> you<00:03:20.340> push<00:03:20.520> down<00:03:20.550> like<00:03:20.850> that

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
sound good when you push down like that

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.280 
sound good when you push down like that
sounds<00:03:21.360> like<00:03:21.450> it's<00:03:21.570> cracking<00:03:21.959> it<00:03:22.050> but<00:03:22.170> it's

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
sounds like it's cracking it but it's

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.449 
sounds like it's cracking it but it's
not<00:03:23.030> and<00:03:24.500> you<00:03:25.500> can<00:03:25.680> see<00:03:25.890> there<00:03:26.100> there's<00:03:26.310> no

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
not and you can see there there's no

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.090 
not and you can see there there's no
scratches<00:03:26.910> or<00:03:27.120> anything<00:03:27.239> but<00:03:27.780> I<00:03:27.989> think<00:03:28.739> if<00:03:29.010> you

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
scratches or anything but I think if you

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.310 
scratches or anything but I think if you
continue<00:03:29.700> to<00:03:29.910> constantly<00:03:30.510> pop<00:03:30.989> this<00:03:31.260> thing

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
continue to constantly pop this thing

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.229 
continue to constantly pop this thing
out<00:03:31.800> and<00:03:31.830> put<00:03:32.070> it<00:03:32.250> back<00:03:32.280> in<00:03:32.640> and<00:03:32.820> pop<00:03:32.970> it<00:03:33.120> out

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
out and put it back in and pop it out

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:39.290 
out and put it back in and pop it out
you<00:03:34.110> probably<00:03:34.500> would<00:03:34.709> crack<00:03:34.980> your<00:03:35.160> game<00:03:38.300> then

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
you probably would crack your game then

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.900 
you probably would crack your game then
there's<00:03:39.510> cases<00:03:39.959> like<00:03:40.140> this<00:03:40.610> they're<00:03:41.610> kind<00:03:41.850> of
