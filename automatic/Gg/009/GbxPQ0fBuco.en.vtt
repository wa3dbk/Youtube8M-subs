00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.020 
retreat and so I go for the switch also
and<00:01:09.659> just<00:01:10.470> like<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.650> predicted<00:01:10.830> she<00:01:11.130> did<00:01:11.430> as

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
and just like I predicted she did as

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.170 
and just like I predicted she did as
well<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.770> matchup<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.369> favorable<00:01:14.850> here

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
well and the matchup is favorable here

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.480 
well and the matchup is favorable here
because<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:16.020> don't<00:01:16.380> know<00:01:16.439> if<00:01:16.530> she<00:01:16.619> also<00:01:16.740> me

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
because I don't know if she also me

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.249 
because I don't know if she also me
maybe<00:01:17.729> she<00:01:17.909> knows<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.060> have<00:01:18.210> ice<00:01:18.390> punch<00:01:18.659> but

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
maybe she knows I have ice punch but

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.810 
maybe she knows I have ice punch but
anyway<00:01:19.500> she<00:01:19.650> has<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.860> oxy<00:01:20.100> bear<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.400> weaken<00:01:20.700> it

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
anyway she has the oxy bear to weaken it

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.690 
anyway she has the oxy bear to weaken it
so<00:01:21.060> when<00:01:21.990> she<00:01:22.020> pulls<00:01:22.259> off<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.409> dragon<00:01:22.890> dance<00:01:23.130> so

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
so when she pulls off a dragon dance so

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.530 
so when she pulls off a dragon dance so
she's<00:01:23.729> faster<00:01:24.530> and<00:01:26.060> she's<00:01:27.060> probably<00:01:27.210> gonna<00:01:27.360> go

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
she's faster and she's probably gonna go

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.510 
she's faster and she's probably gonna go
for<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:27.720> whole<00:01:27.930> outrage<00:01:28.409> thing<00:01:28.770> which<00:01:29.009> she

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
for that whole outrage thing which she

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.039 
for that whole outrage thing which she
does<00:01:29.780> so<00:01:31.340> my<00:01:32.340> cruncher<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.299> gone<00:01:33.630> which<00:01:34.590> sucks

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
does so my cruncher is gone which sucks

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.899 
does so my cruncher is gone which sucks
so<00:01:37.049> I'm<00:01:37.890> kind<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.159> worried<00:01:38.460> now<00:01:38.610> because<00:01:38.640> I

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
so I'm kind of worried now because I

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.060 
so I'm kind of worried now because I
have<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.390> get<00:01:39.689> past<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.110> outrage<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:40.979> is

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
have to get past it outrage so this is

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.499 
have to get past it outrage so this is
kind<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.280> risky<00:01:41.640> but<00:01:41.850> I'm<00:01:42.119> going<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.360> just

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
kind of risky but I'm going to just

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.780 
kind of risky but I'm going to just
start<00:01:42.720> protecting<00:01:43.140> with<00:01:43.439> an<00:01:43.560> inn<00:01:43.680> jeschke<00:01:43.920> so

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
start protecting with an inn jeschke so

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.249 
start protecting with an inn jeschke so
protect<00:01:45.329> works<00:01:45.540> are<00:01:45.689> obviously<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.170> first

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
protect works are obviously the first

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.319 
protect works are obviously the first
time<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.799> second<00:01:47.159> time<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.430> has<00:01:47.549> 50-50<00:01:48.299> chance

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
time the second time it has 50-50 chance

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.990 
time the second time it has 50-50 chance
of<00:01:48.689> working<00:01:48.869> so<00:01:49.310> but<00:01:50.310> luckily<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.700> works<00:01:50.880> out

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
of working so but luckily it works out

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.030 
of working so but luckily it works out
for<00:01:51.180> me<00:01:51.210> again<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:52.079> got<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.380> speed<00:01:52.680> boosts

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
out and I'm trying to figure out what to

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.650 
out and I'm trying to figure out what to
do<00:02:55.220> i<00:02:55.250> mean<00:02:55.459> if<00:02:55.580> i<00:02:55.670> switch<00:02:55.910> out<00:02:56.120> she<00:02:56.330> could<00:02:56.510> use

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
do i mean if i switch out she could use

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.589 
do i mean if i switch out she could use
roar<00:02:57.260> maybe<00:02:57.650> I<00:02:57.739> should<00:02:57.890> just<00:02:57.920> attack<00:02:58.599> I

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
roar maybe I should just attack I

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.630 
roar maybe I should just attack I
actually<00:03:00.290> have<00:03:00.560> ancient<00:03:00.769> power<00:03:01.160> on<00:03:01.489> this

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
actually have ancient power on this

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.490 
actually have ancient power on this
thing<00:03:01.880> so<00:03:01.910> she<00:03:02.299> probably<00:03:02.840> doesn't<00:03:03.080> expect

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
thing so she probably doesn't expect

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.520 
thing so she probably doesn't expect
that<00:03:03.680> maybe<00:03:03.890> and<00:03:04.420> since<00:03:05.420> she's<00:03:06.049> at<00:03:06.200> low<00:03:06.349> health

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
that maybe and since she's at low health

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.520 
that maybe and since she's at low health
ancient<00:03:07.069> power<00:03:07.220> would<00:03:08.150> probably<00:03:08.840> work<00:03:09.019> so

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
ancient power would probably work so

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.140 
ancient power would probably work so
yeah<00:03:09.859> I<00:03:09.890> just<00:03:10.160> go<00:03:10.250> for<00:03:10.280> that<00:03:10.549> anyway<00:03:10.880> and

superpower<00:06:04.240> is<00:06:04.780> well<00:06:05.560> under<00:06:05.950> powered<00:06:06.280> now

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.880 
superpower is well under powered now
especially<00:06:07.210> since<00:06:07.660> many<00:06:08.169> champions<00:06:08.680> part

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:08.890

psychic<00:06:09.280> but<00:06:10.030> she<00:06:10.210> has<00:06:10.300> shadow<00:06:10.600> ball<00:06:10.870> and<00:06:11.050> you

expect<00:06:11.560> that<00:06:11.650> but<00:06:12.160> I<00:06:12.550> figured<00:06:13.000> it<00:06:13.060> would<00:06:13.150> take

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
expect that but I figured it would take

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:14.610 
expect that but I figured it would take
her<00:06:13.360> out<00:06:13.480> anyway<00:06:13.630> because<00:06:14.020> I<00:06:14.169> noticed<00:06:14.470> she<00:06:14.590> had

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620
