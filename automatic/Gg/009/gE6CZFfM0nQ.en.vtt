where's theirs and then how star key

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:01.509 
where's theirs and then how star key
whatever<00:02:55.459> and<00:02:55.750> then<00:02:57.370> nine<00:02:58.370> nine<00:02:59.000> nine<00:03:00.519> eight

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
whatever and then nine nine nine eight

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:11.670 
whatever and then nine nine nine eight
and<00:03:04.269> star<00:03:05.269> key<00:03:05.450> again<00:03:05.919> and<00:03:07.419> then<00:03:08.419> three<00:03:10.480> two

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
and star key again and then three two

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.750 
and star key again and then three two
eight<00:03:12.680> eight<00:03:12.709> and<00:03:15.069> pound<00:03:16.069> key<00:03:16.340> I<00:03:16.370> think<00:03:16.609> that's

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
eight eight and pound key I think that's

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.180 
eight eight and pound key I think that's
called<00:03:16.970> and<00:03:17.299> then<00:03:17.989> the<00:03:18.139> foot<00:03:18.319> count<00:03:18.590> it<00:03:18.889> just

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
called and then the foot count it just

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.360 
called and then the foot count it just
said<00:03:19.430> I<00:03:19.459> didn't<00:03:20.030> really<00:03:20.269> hear<00:03:20.449> it<00:03:20.569> I<00:03:21.370> didn't

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370
