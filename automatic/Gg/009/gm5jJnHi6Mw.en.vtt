00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.309

they're<00:02:45.020> pretty<00:02:45.260> evenly<00:02:45.709> matched<00:02:47.110> so<00:02:48.110> it's

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
they're pretty evenly matched so it's

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.260 
they're pretty evenly matched so it's
going<00:02:48.470> to<00:02:48.530> be<00:02:48.650> more<00:02:48.830> down<00:02:49.069> to<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.340> handling
