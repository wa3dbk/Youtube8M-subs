00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.620
 hi girls and guys here I am 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.110
 again with a different tutorial 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.700
 who had previously seen this 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:20.130
 world a little more bronzed more golden and 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.420
 it is special for which in the summer it is 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:27.030
 the beginning of working day of classes 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.920
 etcetera that let us say a little 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.940
 more tired in what is our 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.009
 usual makeup 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.680
 apart that if we have skin a little 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.300
 more pronounced for having come out a lot 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.720
 to apra in this summer this tutorial 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.660
 skype perfectly fine to start at 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:47.420
 makeup from today I hope them 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.420
 like and lend a lot of function 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.160
 was what I remove the microphone so 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:01:00.430
 for this we are going to apply previously 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.649
 Our concealer is always 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:07.950
 very important since there are people who 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:07.950
 we have a little bit of women then 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.590
 we apply 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.909
 with little touches on our 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.499
 dark circles 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.810
 and already have our corrections 

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:22.150
 realized what we are going to do is 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:26.410
 start our makeup I will use 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:30.430
 an illuminating shadow like this that a 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:33.280
 pearly white tone and what I will do is 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.210
 begin to illuminate below 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.210
 our signal 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.430
 once we have both areas 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:52.740
 illuminated we are going to place in our 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.740
 mobile eyelid one all bronzes 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:03.429
 throughout our delivery 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.429
 this is what it was 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.709
 achieve that the makeup star is 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.760
 devised one more brightness let's say more 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:16.410
 spectacular and most amazing of that 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.410
 fresh touch and cream color 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.500
 once we have it previously 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.500
 applied 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.240
 let's use a shadow 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.470
 we are going to apply this from the following 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:40.660
 way we are going to apply it in everything that 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:43.650
 it will be our eye arch 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.650
 with little touches 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:54.680
 we make an angle that covers the part 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.680
 end of our tabs 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.630
 as little more 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:04.280
 and once they have our arch totally 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.609
 discovered we began to blur toward 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.609
 above 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.370
 trying to come with the illuminated part 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.850
 that we had previously that 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.850
 we did at the beginning 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:23.540
 now what are we going to do with this in this 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:27.349
 opportunity let's delineate our with 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.299
 a brown tone because brown because it is 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:32.569
 good scale that we follow this kind of 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:36.500
 colors and for that I'm going to use it in 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:40.350
 an upper delineation on a brown pencil 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:44.480
 and an external lower eyeliner 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.480
 we are going to do it recently and without fear 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:51.340
 what we will do is 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:53.240
 draw a line very close our 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.200
 tabs 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.200
 with a pencil 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.300
 once having our delineated 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:05.120
 superior let's proceed to do 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:08.500
 our outline on the outside 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.500
 below the stanza 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.590
 the tear to the tail of our 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:28.770
 well once delineated our in the 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:32.190
 way superior and inferior external we go 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:34.770
 to apply a black crayon in our 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.940
 water line to do what would be the 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.940
 internal delineation 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:46.069
 I in my case apply a black eyeliner 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:47.479
 but it is also advisable to do it with 

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:51.020
 a brown crayon 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:52.639
 if you have clearer eyes this will make 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.279
 your eye also looks a little more 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:58.279
 dramatic is applied to our 

00:04:55.279 --> 00:05:01.869
 internal delineation let's start what 

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:01.869
 what is the application of a mask 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.870
 as I said the color of the 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:10.500
 Eyelash mask will also depend 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:14.150
 of each one's taste have in my case 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:17.200
 I applied a black mask 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.200
 by the tone 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.190
 and placing them 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.510
 once have our eye makeup 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:30.090
 fully realized let's start to 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:32.730
 finish our trail then 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:35.340
 considering that we want a look 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:37.680
 cool for what will be the beginning of 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.960
 classes and we also have a little bit of that 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.370
 tan that will be returned to me 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.220
 I just recommend is the following 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:46.380
 that we can apply a layer again 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.680
 of our loose powders to correct 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:51.750
 some imperfection that he called had 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:55.910
 after applying our eyes or removing it 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.910
 remove some external dust 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:03.110
 and now what we are going to apply is a 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.110
 blush 

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:06.939
 or call it 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:13.319
 we can apply it in two tones one is 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:16.650
 the same tone that we use for more 

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:19.530
 eyes that shade of orange since what 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:21.690
 we want to highlight and give a little 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:23.729
 little color to our at least 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:28.169
 we want to overload because well already 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:30.630
 we know it's a very very natural look or 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:34.349
 we can just use a little tone 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:36.630
 more striving in my case I in this 

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:41.180
 opportunity I will use the tone a little 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:41.180
 orange can be a tone 

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:46.670
 and the naughty one in the same way that 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.800
 we apply our normal rumor 

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:51.670
 of the cheek of the half of the cheekbone 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.670
 inward 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:57.650
 our makeup in almost its entirety 

00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:59.479
 What we would lack are the 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:05.530
 this what I recommend using a tone 

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:05.530
 it is newt he explained is a tone like this 

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.970
 this is make up today I hope they 

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:17.699
 have liked and put it into practice 

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:19.259
