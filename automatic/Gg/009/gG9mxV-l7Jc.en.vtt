00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
so far although there have been a couple

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.399 
so far although there have been a couple
of<00:01:09.610> blood<00:01:09.820> ripples<00:01:10.149> yes<00:01:10.390> maybe<00:01:10.720> I<00:01:10.840> don't<00:01:11.170> know

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
of blood ripples yes maybe I don't know

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:12.749 
of blood ripples yes maybe I don't know
if<00:01:11.500> they<00:01:11.590> make<00:01:11.770> that<00:01:11.799> decision<00:01:12.250> after<00:01:12.640> they

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
if they make that decision after they

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:15.510 
if they make that decision after they
missed<00:01:13.030> opening<00:01:13.540> element<00:01:13.990> maybe<00:01:14.520> quadruple

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
missed opening element maybe quadruple

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.160 
missed opening element maybe quadruple
jumps<00:01:15.850> that<00:01:16.060> have<00:01:16.270> been<00:01:16.420> performed<00:01:16.810> more

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
jumps that have been performed more

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.070 
jumps that have been performed more
poorly<00:01:17.500> in<00:01:18.130> this<00:01:18.399> men's<00:01:18.759> free<00:01:19.119> skate<00:01:19.450> in<00:01:19.810> terms

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
poorly in this men's free skate in terms

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.180 
poorly in this men's free skate in terms
of<00:01:20.200> the<00:01:20.259> last<00:01:20.440> two<00:01:20.710> groups

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
of the last two groups

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.609 
of the last two groups
Michael<00:01:21.909> Weiss<00:01:22.060> has<00:01:22.299> decided<00:01:22.659> not<00:01:22.869> to<00:01:23.110> do<00:01:23.470> one

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
Michael Weiss has decided not to do one

00:01:23.619 --> 00:02:07.389 
Michael Weiss has decided not to do one
so<00:01:23.799> far<00:01:24.119> Phe<00:01:25.119> Honda<00:01:25.600> at<00:01:25.810> this<00:01:25.990> point

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:23.460 

nice<00:02:08.360> light<00:02:08.810> deal

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.050 

now<00:02:24.010> they<00:02:24.160> just<00:02:24.190> had<00:02:24.400> a<00:02:24.430> little<00:02:24.640> bit<00:02:24.790> of<00:02:24.880> rest

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
now they just had a little bit of rest

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.570 
now they just had a little bit of rest
there<00:02:25.390> he<00:02:25.930> might<00:02:26.500> go<00:02:26.740> for<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.040> triple<00:02:27.430> axel

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
there he might go for the triple axel

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:42.339 
there he might go for the triple axel
triple<00:02:27.850> teller<00:02:28.240> coming<00:02:28.690> up<00:02:28.810> here

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:45.440 

that's<00:02:43.349> the<00:02:43.560> kind<00:02:43.830> of<00:02:43.980> fall<00:02:44.220> that<00:02:44.730> really<00:02:45.330> is

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
that's the kind of fall that really is

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.080 
that's the kind of fall that really is
the<00:02:45.480> best<00:02:45.870> down<00:02:46.560> up<00:02:47.069> right<00:02:47.580> on<00:02:47.790> with<00:02:48.000> the

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
the best down up right on with the

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.820 
the best down up right on with the
movement<00:02:48.510> as<00:02:48.599> though<00:02:48.930> you<00:02:48.989> didn't<00:02:49.290> even<00:02:49.470> miss

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
movement as though you didn't even miss

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.130 
movement as though you didn't even miss
it<00:02:49.890> B<00:02:50.220> doesn't<00:02:50.849> change<00:02:51.180> your<00:02:51.330> timing<00:02:51.720> too<00:02:51.900> much

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
it B doesn't change your timing too much

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.800 
it B doesn't change your timing too much
I<00:02:53.030> suppose<00:02:54.030> if<00:02:54.150> you<00:02:54.209> have<00:02:54.299> to<00:02:54.420> have<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.569> fall

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
I suppose if you have to have a fall

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:04.369 
I suppose if you have to have a fall
that<00:02:54.840> is

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:07.320 

when<00:03:05.379> he<00:03:05.470> won<00:03:05.620> his<00:03:05.739> first<00:03:05.909> Japanese<00:03:06.909> national

it's<00:03:22.370> interesting<00:03:22.670> watching<00:03:23.150> this<00:03:23.239> program

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
it's interesting watching this program

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.330 
it's interesting watching this program
because<00:03:23.720> a<00:03:23.840> lot<00:03:24.140> of<00:03:24.170> his<00:03:24.560> choreography<00:03:24.920> is

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
because a lot of his choreography is

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.860 
because a lot of his choreography is
geared<00:03:25.640> toward<00:03:25.880> the<00:03:26.030> judges<00:03:26.420> stand<00:03:26.630> right

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
geared toward the judges stand right

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.020 
geared toward the judges stand right
over<00:03:27.110> there<00:03:27.290> he's<00:03:27.500> not<00:03:28.130> playing<00:03:28.430> too<00:03:28.640> much<00:03:28.790> the

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
over there he's not playing too much the

just<00:04:45.360> stuck<00:04:45.780> it<00:04:45.900> in<00:04:46.050> and<00:04:46.260> he<00:04:46.650> left<00:04:46.860> out<00:04:47.070> the
