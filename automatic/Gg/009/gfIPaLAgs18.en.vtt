00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
French application and that was really

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.300 
French application and that was really
hard<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.820> use<00:00:24.029> on<00:00:24.330> like<00:00:24.689> iOS<00:00:25.019> four<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.740> with

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
hard to use on like iOS four and with

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.400 
hard to use on like iOS four and with
the<00:00:26.400> new<00:00:26.430> devices<00:00:26.910> because<00:00:27.599> every<00:00:28.230> time<00:00:28.260> you

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
the new devices because every time you

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.400 
the new devices because every time you
tried<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:28.769> rename<00:00:29.730> something<00:00:30.240> with<00:00:30.689> Retina

tried to rename something with Retina
Display<00:00:31.710> icons<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.520> would<00:00:32.669> make<00:00:33.329> all<00:00:33.510> the

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
Display icons it would make all the

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.299 
Display icons it would make all the
icons<00:00:33.989> like<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.380> whole<00:00:34.590> screen<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.219> that

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
icons like the whole screen and that

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.740 
icons like the whole screen and that
really<00:00:35.550> bugged<00:00:35.760> me<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.180> could<00:00:36.360> rename

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
really bugged me and you could rename

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.709 
really bugged me and you could rename
them<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.620> right<00:00:38.489> here<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.790> won't<00:00:39.000> get<00:00:39.210> an<00:00:39.300> icon

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719
