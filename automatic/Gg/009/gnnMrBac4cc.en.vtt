three was the most Rican fifth forward
worked<00:06:41.470> for<00:06:41.710> a<00:06:41.740> photo<00:06:42.040> when<00:06:42.670> you<00:06:42.700> just

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:00.910 

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:03.969 

now<00:07:01.910> Nick<00:07:02.240> is<00:07:02.300> back<00:07:02.720> on<00:07:02.930> the<00:07:02.960> wave<00:07:03.229> but<00:07:03.680> in<00:07:03.860> a

00:07:03.969 --> 00:07:03.979 
now Nick is back on the wave but in a

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:07.360 
now Nick is back on the wave but in a
shorter<00:07:04.370> boat<00:07:04.900> this<00:07:05.900> was<00:07:06.110> right<00:07:06.380> at<00:07:06.560> max<00:07:06.860> flood

shorter boat this was right at max flood

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:09.520 
shorter boat this was right at max flood
and<00:07:07.759> you<00:07:07.789> can<00:07:08.090> see<00:07:08.300> how<00:07:08.449> the<00:07:08.509> wave<00:07:08.810> is<00:07:09.050> steeper

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:09.530 
and you can see how the wave is steeper

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:13.060 
and you can see how the wave is steeper

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:13.070 
and almost foaming up it even feels like

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.400 
and almost foaming up it even feels like
it<00:07:13.220> wants<00:07:13.370> to<00:07:13.610> collapse<00:07:14.060> but<00:07:14.539> it<00:07:14.630> never<00:07:14.900> did<00:07:15.199> on
