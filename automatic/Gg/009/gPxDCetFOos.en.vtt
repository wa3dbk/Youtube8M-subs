00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.779
 hello friends, well, I hope that 

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:07.450
 you are all very well as always and 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:10.240
 here at home, you know we're here 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:13.090
 always giving new twists to new 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.040
 recipes for you this time what 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.230
 I'm going to do is for those moments in the 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.970
 that we are in a hurry and we are not 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.400
 after a shower to put on cream 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.140
 nothing is about an oil or an oil 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.279
 body for after the night that is 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:29.560
 something quick to apply oil because we 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.169
 is going to give skin elasticity 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.420
 will moisturize us will nourish and good 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.330
 Well, I'm going to put a few oils 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.970
 so that they have the properties of 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:43.000
 these certain oils then yes 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.890
 you want you can add as I do 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.740
 to make some essential oil so that 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.380
 have that personalized aroma that 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.970
 strain yourselves good first 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.600
 oil that I'm going to use is an oil of 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:58.330
 extra virgin olive 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.280
 so be manipulated as least 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.620
 possible without chemicals 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.990
 and in a technical way 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:10.549
 and we're going to take a good amount already 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:14.750
 you know that olive oil for me is 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:17.150
 essential because their fatty acids are 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.009
 very similar to those of the skin I will 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.020
 add now a macerate of marigold 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.119
 also in olive oil but this one 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.659
 you can have macerated in the oil that 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:29.439
 you want 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.540
 and with this what we are going to have are the 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:34.000
 properties of lime in 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:37.780
 we will favor the circulation 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.360
 sanguine just like it is going to 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.700
 detoxify a little bit we will go very 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.820
 good for sunburn so it goes 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.250
 to go and say ideal in this oil 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.800
 for after sunbathing if this is 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.410
 the case you can add more I as you see 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.020
 I will be adding the amounts that I 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:59.640
 seem to prevail over all the 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:05.410
 olive a little bit of avocado oil 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:07.479
 with this is to revitalize and give you a 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.270
 little more life to the skins so more 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.940
 more dry off and now we will add 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.030
 a little bit of sweet almond that also 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.940
 it's for dry and dull skin 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.060
 the casualties will provide that salt 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.920
 Astiz y dad and that nutrition are everything 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.080
 soft oils that go very well for 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.270
 skins 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.700
 thus atopic for sensitive skin 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.270
 let's add a few droplets of 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.270
 Vitamin E 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:48.090
 and a trickle 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.040
 and now we will go on to perfume what I 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.950
 I'm going to add tea tree that is not that 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.650
 its aroma is good to me I do not like it but 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.340
 yes, I love their properties 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:02.250
 it is an antifungal 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.560
 very good healing 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.830
 it's antimicrobial so it's not 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:12.300
 will eliminate everything that they are 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:15.330
 fungal bacteria and can not miss and 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.460
 now yes to perfume I'm going to 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.560
 add a few drops of the band I'm going to 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.630
 add then I have put two or three of 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.450
 tea tree and I will add about four 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.590
 of this and four of the other lavender is 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:31.810
 soothing soothing 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.810
 It is also a very good antiseptic 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.470
 and good especially for its smell 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:42.370
 and now 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:45.610
 we will add a few droplets of yangjiang that 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:49.240
 It is also healing antiseptic and 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:51.750
 It reinforces the skin that 's assuming 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.750
 want to leave 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.160
 also balances it is soothing and 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.800
 relaxing too and good everything too 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:05.350
 it is because its aroma has a smell 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:07.840
 I love good and always 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.760
 as I am very nervous that state of 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.070
 relaxation that can transport you 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.490
 They also go very well now for 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:17.110
 a little rinse finish this the 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.989
 funnel with everything we 've been 

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:21.850
 adding it just happened again a 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.720
 little bit more olive oil and that 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:27.170
 drag 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.230
 well all the other products towards 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.689
 down 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.629
 good 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:36.080
 simple to make true yes simple 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:39.440
 to make and easier to use yet 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:42.110
 we get out of the shower 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.180
 to bathe us how are we going to do 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.000
 and in those moments our skin is 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.560
 as more tender are more squishy has 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.630
 spent soaking 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.490
 the pores are more dilated than 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.620
 normally ideal to apply it the 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.380
 oil 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.760
 that is going to quickly absorb such and 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.860
 as we have already applied it 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.160
 we can dry and dress in jara 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.770
 pringuen does not dirty our clothes or anything 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:10.130
 there is another option that is to leave you 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.290
 put oil and dry in the air or 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:14.240
 even get oil after 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:17.000
 have dried but that is no longer 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.760
 Stain clothes and get oily 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.940
 total is oil but good of the first 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:26.450
 way the body sucks and absorbs all 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:29.300
 The nutrients of this oil is natural 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:31.970
 is ecological you have seen that good if 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.770
 you use first natural materials 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.630
 ecological cold twisted as 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.880
 you will have the properties even more 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:41.270
 powerful if you are using them yes 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.650
 you use refined oil but if you 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.630
 refined oceans for good is better 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:49.510
 what a paraffin that finally and 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:49.510
 Cape is an oil derived from oil 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:57.450
 you can perfume the more or less nothing 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:06:00.070
 because that is completely to your liking and 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:02.260
