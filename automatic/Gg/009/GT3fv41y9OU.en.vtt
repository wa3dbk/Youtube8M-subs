00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
are two people you roll the number of

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.890 
are two people you roll the number of
dice<00:02:19.150> and<00:02:19.680> if<00:02:20.680> you<00:02:20.830> match<00:02:21.239> if<00:02:22.239> you<00:02:22.450> match<00:02:22.630> their

symbols or you get a grenade you score
hail<00:02:25.239> them<00:02:25.450> it's<00:02:26.050> a<00:02:26.140> clever<00:02:26.350> system<00:02:26.680> it<00:02:26.980> does

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
hail them it's a clever system it does

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.910 
hail them it's a clever system it does
ensure<00:02:27.520> that<00:02:28.060> there<00:02:28.660> is<00:02:28.780> some<00:02:28.989> randomness<00:02:29.170> but

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
ensure that there is some randomness but

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.300 
ensure that there is some randomness but
um<00:02:30.130> it<00:02:30.520> still<00:02:30.910> is<00:02:31.180> still<00:02:31.540> a<00:02:32.080> fine<00:02:32.860> mechanic

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
um it still is still a fine mechanic

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.130 
um it still is still a fine mechanic
that<00:02:33.459> works<00:02:33.610> really<00:02:33.820> well<00:02:33.940> now<00:02:34.780> these<00:02:34.930> are<00:02:35.110> the

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
that works really well now these are the

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.560 
that works really well now these are the
classes<00:02:35.680> as<00:02:35.830> your<00:02:36.040> command<00:02:36.400> deck<00:02:36.670> you<00:02:37.390> get<00:02:37.540> a

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
classes as your command deck you get a

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.110 
classes as your command deck you get a
number<00:02:37.780> of<00:02:37.900> these<00:02:38.050> cards<00:02:38.470> based<00:02:38.739> on<00:02:39.010> how<00:02:39.940> well

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
number of these cards based on how well

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.240 
number of these cards based on how well
you<00:02:40.269> forces<00:02:40.690> adarand<00:02:41.110> and<00:02:41.230> as<00:02:41.320> you<00:02:41.440> can<00:02:41.590> see<00:02:41.650> if

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
you forces adarand and as you can see if

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.400 
you forces adarand and as you can see if
split<00:02:43.090> into<00:02:43.180> three<00:02:43.480> areas<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.870> left<00:02:44.200> flank

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
split into three areas the left flank

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.570 
split into three areas the left flank
the<00:02:45.280> center<00:02:45.700> and<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.450> right<00:02:47.320> flank<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:47.830> all

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
the center and the right flank and all

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.770 
the center and the right flank and all
the<00:02:48.700> cards<00:02:48.970> will<00:02:49.120> have<00:02:49.150> different<00:02:49.450> things

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
the cards will have different things

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.330 
the cards will have different things
like<00:02:49.989> for<00:02:50.200> example<00:02:50.290> this<00:02:50.650> one<00:02:50.709> allows<00:02:51.130> you<00:02:51.160> to

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
like for example this one allows you to

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.050 
like for example this one allows you to
order<00:02:51.580> any<00:02:51.970> free<00:02:52.269> units<00:02:52.630> on<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:52.810> right<00:02:52.989> flank

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
order any free units on the right flank

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.420 
order any free units on the right flank
this<00:02:55.060> one<00:02:55.269> here<00:02:58.860> allows<00:02:59.860> you<00:03:00.070> to<00:03:00.250> choose

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
this one here allows you to choose

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.069 
this one here allows you to choose
anyone<00:03:00.700> in<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:01.299> center<00:03:01.600> flanked<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:01.989> then

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
anyone in the center flanked and then

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:03.479 
anyone in the center flanked and then
when<00:03:02.200> you<00:03:02.290> discard<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:02.829> card<00:03:02.980> rather<00:03:03.340> than

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
when you discard the card rather than

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.940 
when you discard the card rather than
just<00:03:03.700> drawn<00:03:03.910> one<00:03:04.120> new<00:03:04.299> card<00:03:04.540> you<00:03:05.200> draw<00:03:05.410> two<00:03:05.650> and

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
just drawn one new card you draw two and

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.670 
just drawn one new card you draw two and
you<00:03:06.430> choose<00:03:06.640> the<00:03:06.760> best<00:03:06.940> one<00:03:07.209> a<00:03:07.620> carve<00:03:08.620> like

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
you choose the best one a carve like

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.100 
you choose the best one a carve like
barrage<00:03:09.269> basically<00:03:10.269> allows<00:03:10.450> you<00:03:10.600> to<00:03:10.660> target

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
barrage basically allows you to target

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.949 
barrage basically allows you to target
one<00:03:11.260> enemy<00:03:11.590> unit<00:03:11.920> ROFL<00:03:12.489> dice<00:03:12.730> and<00:03:13.090> you've<00:03:13.840> got

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
one enemy unit ROFL dice and you've got

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.449 
one enemy unit ROFL dice and you've got
a<00:03:13.989> good<00:03:14.200> chance<00:03:14.410> of<00:03:14.530> taking<00:03:14.709> out<00:03:14.950> our<00:03:15.100> unit

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
a good chance of taking out our unit

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.229 
a good chance of taking out our unit
considering<00:03:16.000> a<00:03:16.120> unit<00:03:16.180> consists<00:03:17.170> of<00:03:17.290> four<00:03:18.239> full

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
considering a unit consists of four full

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.289 
considering a unit consists of four full
cards<00:03:19.690> if<00:03:19.900> it's<00:03:20.049> a<00:03:20.200> full<00:03:21.160> benefit<00:03:21.640> of<00:03:21.670> infantry

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
cards if it's a full benefit of infantry

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.539 
cards if it's a full benefit of infantry
or<00:03:22.510> free<00:03:22.810> if<00:03:22.900> it's<00:03:23.049> a<00:03:23.140> tank<00:03:23.410> there's<00:03:24.250> a<00:03:24.370> good

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
or free if it's a tank there's a good

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.350 
or free if it's a tank there's a good
chance<00:03:24.790> that<00:03:25.000> you're<00:03:25.299> gonna<00:03:25.450> do<00:03:26.290> some<00:03:26.500> damage

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
chance that you're gonna do some damage

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.880 
chance that you're gonna do some damage
now<00:03:28.360> these<00:03:28.510> here<00:03:28.810> these<00:03:29.049> are<00:03:29.230> terrain<00:03:29.500> cards

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
now these here these are terrain cards

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.199 
now these here these are terrain cards
again<00:03:30.220> there's<00:03:30.370> a<00:03:30.430> huge<00:03:30.700> number<00:03:30.880> of<00:03:31.030> these

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
again there's a huge number of these

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.120 
again there's a huge number of these
they're<00:03:31.480> double-sided<00:03:31.930> and<00:03:32.530> they<00:03:32.680> represent

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
they're double-sided and they represent

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.030 
they're double-sided and they represent
different<00:03:33.190> things<00:03:33.489> so<00:03:34.120> this<00:03:34.269> is<00:03:34.390> a<00:03:34.420> hedgerow

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
different things so this is a hedgerow

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.960 
different things so this is a hedgerow
this<00:03:36.040> is<00:03:36.160> a<00:03:36.190> hill<00:03:37.470> this<00:03:38.470> is<00:03:38.620> wood<00:03:38.850> here's<00:03:39.850> a

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
this is a hill this is wood here's a

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.600 
this is a hill this is wood here's a
river<00:03:42.299> and<00:03:43.299> here's<00:03:44.290> a<00:03:44.380> his<00:03:44.739> at<00:03:44.890> an<00:03:45.070> all-city

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
river and here's a his at an all-city

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:46.979 
river and here's a his at an all-city
and<00:03:45.820> again<00:03:46.450> they've<00:03:46.600> all<00:03:46.750> got<00:03:46.900> different

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
and again they've all got different

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.960 
and again they've all got different
bonuses<00:03:47.560> as<00:03:47.739> well<00:03:47.950> so<00:03:48.160> when<00:03:48.459> you're<00:03:48.579> in<00:03:48.640> a<00:03:48.700> town

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
bonuses as well so when you're in a town

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.650 
bonuses as well so when you're in a town
it<00:03:50.280> it<00:03:51.280> basically<00:03:51.519> gives<00:03:51.910> you<00:03:51.970> a<00:03:52.030> defense<00:03:52.450> on

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
it it basically gives you a defense on

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.390 
it it basically gives you a defense on
die<00:03:52.870> so<00:03:53.140> anybody<00:03:53.320> who<00:03:53.650> wants<00:03:53.859> to<00:03:53.890> attack<00:03:54.250> you

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
die so anybody who wants to attack you

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.300 
die so anybody who wants to attack you
they<00:03:54.609> immediately<00:03:55.120> lose<00:03:55.359> one<00:03:55.570> die

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
they immediately lose one die

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.160 
they immediately lose one die
things<00:03:57.310> like<00:03:57.430> forest<00:03:57.850> block<00:03:58.510> line-of-sight

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
things like forest block line-of-sight

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.080 
things like forest block line-of-sight
rivers<00:03:59.680> are<00:03:59.799> impassable<00:04:00.130> unless<00:04:00.760> you're<00:04:00.970> at<00:04:01.060> a

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
rivers are impassable unless you're at a

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.809 
rivers are impassable unless you're at a
break<00:04:01.420> and<00:04:02.190> to<00:04:03.190> show<00:04:03.340> you<00:04:03.400> what<00:04:03.459> the<00:04:03.610> bridge

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
break and to show you what the bridge

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:05.610 
break and to show you what the bridge
looks<00:04:04.150> like<00:04:04.390> this<00:04:04.599> is<00:04:04.780> this<00:04:05.050> is<00:04:05.110> a<00:04:05.230> bridge<00:04:05.470> I

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
looks like this is this is a bridge I

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.400 
looks like this is this is a bridge I
can<00:04:05.860> and<00:04:06.040> I<00:04:06.069> get

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
can and I get

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.930
