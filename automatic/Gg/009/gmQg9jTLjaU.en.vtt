lab today we're going to talk about the

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.240 
lab today we're going to talk about the
basics<00:00:11.849> of<00:00:12.090> plasma<00:00:12.840> arc<00:00:13.080> cutting<00:00:13.380> so<00:00:13.799> what

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
basics of plasma arc cutting so what

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.359 
basics of plasma arc cutting so what
you'll<00:00:14.370> need<00:00:14.519> to<00:00:14.610> cut<00:00:14.820> is<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.089> plasma<00:00:15.870> cutter

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369 
you'll need to cut is a plasma cutter

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.580 
you'll need to cut is a plasma cutter
compressed<00:00:17.369> gas<00:00:17.640> or<00:00:17.970> an<00:00:18.300> inert<00:00:18.570> gas<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.840> gas

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
compressed gas or an inert gas a gas

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.800 
compressed gas or an inert gas a gas
that<00:00:19.859> won't<00:00:20.070> burn<00:00:20.279> here's<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:21.029> negative<00:00:21.449> lead

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
that won't burn here's a negative lead

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.130 
that won't burn here's a negative lead
you'll<00:00:22.230> need<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.680> ground<00:00:23.130> clamp<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.630> cutting

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
you'll need a ground clamp and a cutting

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.550 
you'll need a ground clamp and a cutting
torch<00:00:25.490> with<00:00:26.490> this<00:00:26.609> equipment<00:00:27.090> we<00:00:27.210> can<00:00:27.390> cut<00:00:27.689> any

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
torch with this equipment we can cut any

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.769 
torch with this equipment we can cut any
anything<00:00:29.279> they'll<00:00:29.580> conduct<00:00:29.970> electricity<00:00:30.420> so

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
anything they'll conduct electricity so

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.749 
anything they'll conduct electricity so
what<00:00:31.109> happens<00:00:31.410> when<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:31.710> initiate<00:00:32.009> an<00:00:32.430> arc

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
what happens when you initiate an arc

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.720 
what happens when you initiate an arc
you're<00:00:33.270> forcing<00:00:33.870> compressed<00:00:34.590> air<00:00:34.890> through<00:00:35.219> a

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
you're forcing compressed air through a

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.389 
you're forcing compressed air through a
nozzle<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.390> arc<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.290> formed<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.739> pilot<00:00:38.190> arc

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
nozzle and arc is formed the pilot arc

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.810 
nozzle and arc is formed the pilot arc
and<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:39.390> creates<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:40.410> plasma<00:00:41.160> some<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.760> that

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
and it creates a plasma some of that

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.910 
and it creates a plasma some of that
compressed<00:00:42.239> air<00:00:42.420> has<00:00:42.570> turned<00:00:42.840> into<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.200> plasma

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
compressed air has turned into a plasma

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.430 
compressed air has turned into a plasma
state<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.910> plasma<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.420> forced<00:00:45.809> with<00:00:46.289> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
state and the plasma is forced with the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.260 
state and the plasma is forced with the
air<00:00:46.559> through<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.950> nozzle<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.550> that's<00:00:48.090> what

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
air through the nozzle and that's what

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.940 
air through the nozzle and that's what
does<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.570> cutting<00:00:48.780> so<00:00:49.289> what's<00:00:49.559> happening

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
does the cutting so what's happening

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.470 
does the cutting so what's happening
here<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:51.410> when<00:00:52.410> they<00:00:52.500> initiate<00:00:53.090> the<00:00:54.090> the

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
here the when they initiate the the

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.110 
here the when they initiate the the
torch<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:55.410> create<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.800> high<00:00:56.129> voltage<00:00:56.190> low

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
torch you create a high voltage low

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.020 
torch you create a high voltage low
current<00:00:57.770> spark<00:00:58.770> inside<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.520> torch<00:00:59.760> and<00:00:59.969> the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
current spark inside the torch and the

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.959 
current spark inside the torch and the
spark<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:01.230> igniting<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.280> air<00:01:02.489> coming<00:01:02.850> through

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
spark is igniting the air coming through

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.789 
spark is igniting the air coming through
the<00:01:03.600> compressed<00:01:04.019> air<00:01:04.140> coming<00:01:04.470> through<00:01:04.650> and

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
the compressed air coming through and

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.000 
the compressed air coming through and
they're<00:01:05.090> forming<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.360> pocket<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.229> plasma<00:01:07.799> now

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
they're forming a pocket of plasma now

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.620 
they're forming a pocket of plasma now
when<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.280> come<00:01:08.460> in<00:01:08.549> contact<00:01:08.700> with<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.150> metal

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
when you come in contact with a metal

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.679 
when you come in contact with a metal
that<00:01:10.409> pocket<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.670> air<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:12.030> being<00:01:12.180> forced

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
that pocket the the air is being forced

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.570 
that pocket the the air is being forced
through<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.680> plasma<00:01:13.890> is<00:01:14.189> now<00:01:14.310> being

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
through and the plasma is now being

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.789 
through and the plasma is now being
forced<00:01:14.880> out<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.390> they're<00:01:15.810> forcing<00:01:16.590> the

the<00:04:11.829> the<00:04:12.280> black<00:04:12.610> circle<00:04:13.180> is<00:04:13.390> my<00:04:13.750> 110<00:04:14.850> voltage

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
the the black circle is my 110 voltage

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.740 
the the black circle is my 110 voltage
setting<00:04:16.239> and<00:04:16.419> the<00:04:16.479> red<00:04:16.750> band<00:04:17.350> here<00:04:17.769> is<00:04:17.919> my<00:04:18.100> 220

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
setting and the red band here is my 220

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.170 
setting and the red band here is my 220
voltage<00:04:19.750> setting<00:04:20.260> so<00:04:20.530> I<00:04:20.739> can<00:04:21.099> only<00:04:21.250> cut<00:04:21.580> in<00:04:21.789> the

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
voltage setting so I can only cut in the

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.290 
voltage setting so I can only cut in the
black

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
black

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.950 
black
and<00:04:23.419> while<00:04:24.020> we're<00:04:24.199> in<00:04:24.229> 110<00:04:24.860> so<00:04:25.419> my<00:04:26.419> max<00:04:26.780> is

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
and while we're in 110 so my max is

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.129 
and while we're in 110 so my max is
gonna<00:04:27.169> be<00:04:27.379> about<00:04:27.470> 30<00:04:28.310> amps<00:04:28.789> there<00:04:29.330> when<00:04:29.900> I'd<00:04:30.020> go

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
gonna be about 30 amps there when I'd go

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.499 
gonna be about 30 amps there when I'd go
to<00:04:30.169> 220<00:04:30.770> then<00:04:31.009> I'm<00:04:31.099> go<00:04:31.250> to<00:04:31.310> up<00:04:31.580> to<00:04:31.759> 40<00:04:32.090> amps<00:04:32.389> and

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:32.509 
to 220 then I'm go to up to 40 amps and

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:35.309 
to 220 then I'm go to up to 40 amps and
obviously<00:04:33.349> more<00:04:33.590> power<00:04:33.830> more<00:04:34.220> amps<00:04:34.819> equals

00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:35.319 
obviously more power more amps equals

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:39.010 
obviously more power more amps equals
thicker<00:04:36.319> cutting<00:04:36.919> of<00:04:37.099> material<00:04:38.090> so<00:04:38.270> place<00:04:38.539> to

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
thicker cutting of material so place to

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.980 
thicker cutting of material so place to
set<00:04:39.259> the<00:04:39.289> Machine<00:04:39.590> up<00:04:39.740> I'm<00:04:39.889> on<00:04:39.919> run<00:04:40.280> here<00:04:40.990> so
