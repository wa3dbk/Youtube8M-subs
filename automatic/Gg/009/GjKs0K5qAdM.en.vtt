00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
is stagger him before he changes it to

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.889 
is stagger him before he changes it to
his<00:00:31.679> like<00:00:31.830> winged<00:00:32.369> form<00:00:32.750> metamorphosis<00:00:33.750> or

his like winged form metamorphosis or
something<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:35.160> right<00:00:35.309> now<00:00:35.520> I'm<00:00:35.730> sad<00:00:36.300> as<00:00:36.450> is

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
something so right now I'm sad as is

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.100 
something so right now I'm sad as is
buffing<00:00:37.020> up<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.230> whole<00:00:37.380> tie<00:00:37.530> party<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:39.110> snow

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
buffing up the whole tie party and snow

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.270 
buffing up the whole tie party and snow
is<00:00:40.290> just<00:00:40.500> taking<00:00:40.860> all<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.219> damage<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:43.280> so

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
is just taking all of the damage and so

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.529 
is just taking all of the damage and so
that<00:00:44.430> that's<00:00:44.820> pretty<00:00:44.940> much<00:00:45.059> what<00:00:45.329> we're<00:00:45.450> just

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
that that's pretty much what we're just

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.040 
that that's pretty much what we're just
doing<00:00:45.719> right<00:00:45.960> now<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:47.719> once<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:48.809> do<00:00:48.899> your

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
doing right now and once you do your

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.380 
doing right now and once you do your
entire<00:00:49.350> entire<00:00:49.890> party<00:00:50.820> buffed<00:00:51.030> up<00:00:51.210> you're

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
entire entire party buffed up you're

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.889 
entire entire party buffed up you're
gonna<00:00:51.510> switch<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.350> try<00:00:52.890> disaster<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.899> what

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
gonna switch to try disaster and what

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.060 
gonna switch to try disaster and what
we're<00:00:55.050> gonna<00:00:55.140> do<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.469> stagger<00:00:55.949> him

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.280 

and<00:01:01.970> like<00:01:02.120> I<00:01:02.240> said<00:01:02.300> I<00:01:02.540> like<00:01:02.750> to<00:01:02.780> you<00:01:02.990> says

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
and like I said I like to you says

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.290 
and like I said I like to you says
because<00:01:03.710> it<00:01:03.860> also<00:01:04.010> gives<00:01:04.160> you<00:01:04.400> haste<00:01:04.640> which<00:01:05.000> I

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
because it also gives you haste which I

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.650 
because it also gives you haste which I
think<00:01:05.870> it<00:01:05.990> doubles<00:01:06.380> the<00:01:06.640> h-e-b<00:01:07.640> charge<00:01:07.940> so

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:08.660 
think it doubles the h-e-b charge so

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.910 
think it doubles the h-e-b charge so
that's<00:01:08.810> really<00:01:09.350> useful<00:01:09.620> for<00:01:10.160> this<00:01:10.280> fight<00:01:10.520> and

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
that's really useful for this fight and

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.070 
that's really useful for this fight and
don't<00:01:12.920> worry<00:01:13.130> about<00:01:13.240> him<00:01:14.240> changing<00:01:14.720> before

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
don't worry about him changing before

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.590 
don't worry about him changing before
you<00:01:15.200> stagger<00:01:15.470> because<00:01:16.040> it's<00:01:16.940> not<00:01:17.180> based<00:01:17.420> on

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
you stagger because it's not based on

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.280 
you stagger because it's not based on
the<00:01:17.780> amount<00:01:18.020> of<00:01:18.080> time<00:01:18.520> it's<00:01:19.720> a<00:01:20.720> base<00:01:20.900> on<00:01:21.229> the

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
the amount of time it's a base on the

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.780 
the amount of time it's a base on the
amount<00:01:21.620> of<00:01:21.680> damage<00:01:22.070> you<00:01:22.100> do<00:01:22.310> to<00:01:22.340> them<00:01:22.610> before

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
amount of damage you do to them before

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.620 
amount of damage you do to them before
he<00:01:23.030> changes<00:01:23.390> and<00:01:24.610> one<00:01:25.610> thing<00:01:25.880> one<00:01:26.270> thing<00:01:26.300> you

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
he changes and one thing one thing you

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.900 
he changes and one thing one thing you
want<00:01:26.870> to<00:01:27.350> make<00:01:27.500> sure<00:01:27.530> not<00:01:27.979> to<00:01:28.040> do<00:01:28.310> is<00:01:28.520> stagger

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
want to make sure not to do is stagger

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:35.770 
want to make sure not to do is stagger
him<00:01:29.180> when<00:01:29.330> he's<00:01:29.479> in<00:01:29.510> guard<00:01:29.900> mode<00:01:32.680> so<00:01:34.780> since

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
him when he's in guard mode so since

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.450 
him when he's in guard mode so since
lightning<00:01:36.080> is<00:01:36.259> about<00:01:36.440> to<00:01:36.560> die<00:01:36.650> I<00:01:36.680> just<00:01:37.100> decide

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
lightning is about to die I just decide

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.340 
lightning is about to die I just decide
to<00:01:37.490> switch<00:01:37.790> back<00:01:38.030> so<00:01:38.270> she<00:01:38.330> doesn't<00:01:38.600> die<00:01:38.810> cuz

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
to switch back so she doesn't die cuz

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.840 
to switch back so she doesn't die cuz
that's<00:01:39.560> not<00:01:39.680> very<00:01:39.800> much<00:01:40.040> useful<00:01:41.140> so<00:01:42.850> since

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
that's not very much useful so since

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.430 
that's not very much useful so since
he's<00:01:43.970> in<00:01:44.119> guard<00:01:44.330> right<00:01:44.509> now<00:01:44.660> I<00:01:44.930> don't<00:01:45.020> want<00:01:45.350> to

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
he's in guard right now I don't want to

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.740 
he's in guard right now I don't want to
stagger<00:01:45.680> him<00:01:46.009> well<00:01:46.820> he's<00:01:46.970> in<00:01:47.090> guard<00:01:47.330> cuz<00:01:47.570> then

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
stagger him well he's in guard cuz then

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.840 
stagger him well he's in guard cuz then
you<00:01:47.900> won't<00:01:48.110> have<00:01:48.410> any<00:01:48.950> chance<00:01:49.250> to<00:01:49.490> kill<00:01:49.700> him

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
you won't have any chance to kill him

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.130 
you won't have any chance to kill him
when<00:01:50.270> you<00:01:50.360> stagger<00:01:50.600> him<00:01:51.610> so<00:01:52.810> but<00:01:53.810> I<00:01:53.840> have<00:01:53.990> to

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
when you stagger him so but I have to

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.180 
when you stagger him so but I have to
watch<00:01:54.259> that

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
watch that

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.999 
watch that
stagger<00:01:56.180> bar<00:01:56.390> because<00:01:56.630> if<00:01:56.810> it<00:01:56.930> gets<00:01:57.110> down<00:01:57.350> then

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
stagger bar because if it gets down then

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.430 
stagger bar because if it gets down then
won't<00:01:58.220> go<00:01:58.310> back<00:01:58.460> to<00:01:58.580> 100%<00:01:59.140> so<00:02:00.140> now<00:02:00.229> I'm<00:02:00.320> going

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
won't go back to 100% so now I'm going

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.340 
won't go back to 100% so now I'm going
to<00:02:00.500> switch<00:02:00.770> and<00:02:01.149> see<00:02:02.149> he's<00:02:02.899> not<00:02:03.050> a<00:02:03.110> guard

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
to switch and see he's not a guard

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.380 
to switch and see he's not a guard
anymore<00:02:03.619> so<00:02:04.040> this<00:02:04.610> is<00:02:04.790> a<00:02:04.820> perfect<00:02:05.240> time<00:02:05.330> to

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
anymore so this is a perfect time to

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.029 
anymore so this is a perfect time to
stagger<00:02:05.810> him

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.539
