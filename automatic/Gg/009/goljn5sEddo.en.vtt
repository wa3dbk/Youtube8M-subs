lot of different our perspective on

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:42.150 
lot of different our perspective on

so<00:00:42.820> Charlie<00:00:43.210> were<00:00:44.080> riding<00:00:44.410> the<00:00:44.500> jet<00:00:44.650> 9r<00:00:45.250> do

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
so Charlie were riding the jet 9r do

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.390 
so Charlie were riding the jet 9r do
from<00:00:45.970> Niner<00:00:46.180> bikes<00:00:46.480> and<00:00:46.949> four<00:00:47.949> inch<00:00:48.100> travel

rear<00:00:48.760> you<00:00:49.000> have<00:00:49.150> it<00:00:49.269> set<00:00:49.449> with<00:00:49.570> the<00:00:49.660> 124<00:00:50.500> it

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.070 
rear you have it set with the 124 it
Stiles<00:00:51.370> fork<00:00:51.730> so<00:00:51.940> it<00:00:52.000> will<00:00:52.150> drop<00:00:52.330> down<00:00:52.390> to<00:00:52.570> 95

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.080 
Stiles fork so it will drop down to 95

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.289 
Stiles fork so it will drop down to 95
melt<00:00:53.410> what<00:00:54.280> do<00:00:54.339> you<00:00:54.400> think<00:00:54.580> the<00:00:54.670> strengths<00:00:55.120> of

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:55.299 
melt what do you think the strengths of

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:58.259 
melt what do you think the strengths of
this<00:00:55.449> bike<00:00:55.720> was<00:00:56.640> if<00:00:57.640> you<00:00:57.760> just<00:00:57.790> count<00:00:58.059> the

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269 
this bike was if you just count the

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:01.500 
this bike was if you just count the
Niner<00:00:58.479> frame<00:00:59.670> carbon<00:01:00.670> frame<00:01:00.850> obviously<00:01:01.420> it

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
Niner frame carbon frame obviously it

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.110 
Niner frame carbon frame obviously it
gets<00:01:01.659> rid<00:01:01.809> of<00:01:01.839> small<00:01:02.440> vibrations<00:01:03.100> and<00:01:03.820> I<00:01:03.909> think

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
gets rid of small vibrations and I think

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.359 
gets rid of small vibrations and I think
that<00:01:04.299> kind<00:01:04.720> of<00:01:04.809> helps<00:01:05.049> them<00:01:05.140> be<00:01:05.320> able<00:01:05.409> to<00:01:05.560> the

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
that kind of helps them be able to the

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:07.649 
that kind of helps them be able to the
suspension<00:01:06.760> to<00:01:06.970> do<00:01:07.090> some<00:01:07.270> different<00:01:07.540> things

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
suspension to do some different things

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:08.730 
suspension to do some different things
they<00:01:07.840> don't<00:01:07.900> have<00:01:08.049> to<00:01:08.140> worry<00:01:08.320> about<00:01:08.440> that

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
they don't have to worry about that

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.149 
they don't have to worry about that
initial<00:01:09.520> hit<00:01:09.729> being<00:01:10.659> little<00:01:11.619> vibrations

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
initial hit being little vibrations

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.719

being<00:01:12.430> rough<00:01:12.640> like<00:01:13.420> aluminum<00:01:14.140> bike<00:01:14.290> wood<00:01:14.729> as

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
probably all niners that I've ridden you

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.340 
probably all niners that I've ridden you
almost<00:01:19.150> think<00:01:19.390> about<00:01:19.510> them<00:01:19.869> and<00:01:19.960> they<00:01:20.080> steer

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
almost think about them and they steer

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.690 
almost think about them and they steer
and<00:01:20.590> you<00:01:20.740> steer<00:01:21.010> them<00:01:21.100> with<00:01:21.189> the<00:01:21.280> hips<00:01:21.490> your

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
and you steer them with the hips your

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.000 
and you steer them with the hips your
feet<00:01:21.880> you<00:01:22.240> don't<00:01:22.360> have<00:01:22.570> to<00:01:22.720> you<00:01:23.530> know<00:01:23.560> you<00:01:23.770> just

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010 
feet you don't have to you know you just

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.680 
feet you don't have to you know you just
ride<00:01:24.700> the<00:01:24.850> bike<00:01:25.000> you<00:01:25.150> don't<00:01:25.299> have<00:01:25.390> to<00:01:25.479> worry

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
ride the bike you don't have to worry

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.080 
ride the bike you don't have to worry
about<00:01:25.780> where<00:01:26.320> your<00:01:26.500> steering<00:01:26.740> and<00:01:27.250> pushing

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
about where your steering and pushing

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.720 
about where your steering and pushing
the<00:01:28.180> front<00:01:28.390> end<00:01:28.510> and<00:01:28.630> around<00:01:29.020> a<00:01:29.140> lot<00:01:29.490> okay<00:01:30.490> so

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:30.730 
the front end and around a lot okay so

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.220 
the front end and around a lot okay so
you'd<00:01:30.910> say<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.210> strength<00:01:31.480> is<00:01:31.690> its<00:01:31.900> its

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.230 
you'd say the strength is its its

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.140 
you'd say the strength is its its
steering<00:01:32.530> response<00:01:33.070> its<00:01:33.310> responsiveness<00:01:34.000> to

steering response its responsiveness to

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.690 
steering response its responsiveness to
rider<00:01:34.480> input<00:01:35.130> steering<00:01:36.130> and<00:01:36.310> then<00:01:36.430> the<00:01:36.550> other

take<00:01:58.870> a<00:01:58.900> little<00:01:59.170> bit<00:01:59.260> of<00:01:59.320> everything<00:01:59.500> I<00:01:59.740> did<00:01:59.800> to

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
take a little bit of everything I did to

take a little bit of everything I did to
six<00:02:00.280> hour<00:02:00.430> rides<00:02:00.670> up<00:02:00.880> there<00:02:01.000> in<00:02:01.090> the<00:02:01.150> summer

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
six hour rides up there in the summer

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.550 
six hour rides up there in the summer
late<00:02:02.140> summer<00:02:02.170> on<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:04.420> but<00:02:04.600> I<00:02:04.780> never<00:02:05.110> got<00:02:05.320> tired

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
late summer on the but I never got tired

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.870 
late summer on the but I never got tired
and<00:02:05.800> I<00:02:05.830> thought<00:02:05.950> what<00:02:06.130> a<00:02:06.159> hardtail<00:02:06.550> I<00:02:06.610> should

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
and I thought what a hardtail I should

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:07.800 
and I thought what a hardtail I should
have<00:02:06.970> run<00:02:07.090> two<00:02:07.270> or<00:02:07.360> three<00:02:07.510> more<00:02:07.659> hours

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
have run two or three more hours

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:08.930 
have run two or three more hours
probably

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
probably

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.730 
probably
maybe<00:02:09.540> not<00:02:09.690> as<00:02:09.750> fast<00:02:09.900> as<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.200> would<00:02:10.290> on<00:02:10.350> my<00:02:10.560> heart

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
maybe not as fast as I would on my heart

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.820 
maybe not as fast as I would on my heart
tail<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.640> know<00:02:11.670> over<00:02:12.090> seven<00:02:12.600> six-hour<00:02:13.020> period

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
tail you know over seven six-hour period

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.660 
tail you know over seven six-hour period
definitely<00:02:14.400> so<00:02:15.380> I<00:02:16.380> guess<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.130> next<00:02:17.160> question

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
definitely so I guess the next question

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.760 
definitely so I guess the next question
would<00:02:17.760> be<00:02:17.820> did<00:02:18.480> you<00:02:18.630> perceive<00:02:18.930> any<00:02:19.140> weaknesses

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
would be did you perceive any weaknesses

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.340 
would be did you perceive any weaknesses
or<00:02:20.090> not<00:02:21.090> even<00:02:21.360> necessarily<00:02:21.690> weaknesses<00:02:22.230> but

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
or not even necessarily weaknesses but

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.620 
or not even necessarily weaknesses but
areas<00:02:22.710> you<00:02:22.890> thought<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:24.000> bike<00:02:24.150> held<00:02:24.390> you<00:02:24.510> back

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
areas you thought the bike held you back

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.770 
areas you thought the bike held you back
a<00:02:24.690> little<00:02:24.840> bit<00:02:28.520> mostly<00:02:29.520> I<00:02:29.640> didn't<00:02:29.940> do<00:02:30.360> any<00:02:30.600> long

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
a little bit mostly I didn't do any long

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.750 
a little bit mostly I didn't do any long
dirt<00:02:31.050> road<00:02:31.080> climbing<00:02:31.770> yeah<00:02:31.920> I'm<00:02:32.160> kind<00:02:32.640> of

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
dirt road climbing yeah I'm kind of

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.880 
dirt road climbing yeah I'm kind of
wrought<00:02:32.940> a<00:02:32.970> lot<00:02:33.150> of<00:02:33.300> firmer<00:02:34.230> hardtail<00:02:34.650> type

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
wrought a lot of firmer hardtail type

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.860 
wrought a lot of firmer hardtail type
stuff<00:02:35.220> there's<00:02:36.150> really<00:02:36.270> no<00:02:36.450> where<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.720> bike

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
stuff there's really no where the bike

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.510 
stuff there's really no where the bike
held<00:02:37.110> me<00:02:37.230> back<00:02:37.380> I<00:02:37.620> mean<00:02:37.740> it<00:02:37.890> made<00:02:38.040> me<00:02:38.130> faster

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
held me back I mean it made me faster

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.030 
held me back I mean it made me faster
everywhere<00:02:38.910> it<00:02:39.780> made<00:02:39.930> me<00:02:40.050> to<00:02:40.200> fast<00:02:40.440> at<00:02:40.620> times<00:02:40.800> I

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
everywhere it made me to fast at times I

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.170 
everywhere it made me to fast at times I
wrecked<00:02:41.220> it<00:02:41.310> once<00:02:41.490> or<00:02:41.610> twice<00:02:41.640> where<00:02:42.030> I<00:02:42.090> should

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
wrecked it once or twice where I should

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.640 
wrecked it once or twice where I should
have<00:02:42.420> been<00:02:42.540> gone<00:02:42.630> so<00:02:42.840> fast<00:02:43.020> I<00:02:45.470> think<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:46.560> was

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
have been gone so fast I think it was

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.080 
have been gone so fast I think it was
very<00:02:46.830> important<00:02:47.310> which<00:02:47.580> we<00:02:47.940> were<00:02:48.060> just

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
very important which we were just

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.180 
very important which we were just
talking<00:02:48.300> it's<00:02:49.230> very<00:02:49.470> important<00:02:49.890> to<00:02:49.950> set<00:02:50.130> the

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
talking it's very important to set the

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
talking it's very important to set the
shock<00:02:50.760> up<00:02:50.940> right<00:02:52.190> once<00:02:53.190> I<00:02:53.340> had<00:02:53.490> the<00:02:53.640> shock<00:02:53.880> set

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
shock up right once I had the shock set

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.890 
shock up right once I had the shock set
the<00:02:54.390> right<00:02:54.570> air<00:02:56.240> let's<00:02:57.240> talk<00:02:57.420> about<00:02:57.540> who

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
the right air let's talk about who

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.970 
the right air let's talk about who
should<00:02:57.960> be<00:02:58.170> riding<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.650> bike<00:02:58.800> with<00:02:59.520> the<00:03:00.060> 124

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980

should be riding the bike with the 124

do setting us up with 124 makes it I

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.350 
do setting us up with 124 makes it I
think<00:03:13.680> Zack<00:03:14.400> Ryder<00:03:14.610> would<00:03:14.820> be<00:03:14.910> someone<00:03:15.240> who

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
think Zack Ryder would be someone who

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.510 
think Zack Ryder would be someone who
wants<00:03:16.110> to<00:03:16.290> be<00:03:16.410> really<00:03:16.680> fast<00:03:17.040> riding<00:03:17.400> with

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
wants to be really fast riding with

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.540 
wants to be really fast riding with
their<00:03:17.640> buddies<00:03:17.790> you<00:03:18.720> know<00:03:19.130> they<00:03:20.130> want<00:03:20.340> to<00:03:20.430> be

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
their buddies you know they want to be

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.100 
their buddies you know they want to be
able<00:03:20.610> to<00:03:20.730> move<00:03:20.910> fast<00:03:21.210> because<00:03:21.330> you<00:03:21.540> have<00:03:21.690> a<00:03:21.720> 100

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
able to move fast because you have a 100

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.560 
able to move fast because you have a 100
versus<00:03:22.470> a<00:03:22.500> longer<00:03:22.980> travel<00:03:23.280> bike<00:03:23.460> but<00:03:24.450> they

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
versus a longer travel bike but they

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.630 
versus a longer travel bike but they
want<00:03:24.810> a<00:03:24.930> little<00:03:25.710> bit<00:03:25.950> accelerate<00:03:26.460> on<00:03:26.550> the

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
want a little bit accelerate on the

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:37.850 
want a little bit accelerate on the
downhill<00:03:36.080> so<00:03:37.080> would<00:03:37.230> you<00:03:37.350> put<00:03:37.530> it<00:03:37.620> with<00:03:37.770> the

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
downhill so would you put it with the

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.380 
downhill so would you put it with the
120<00:03:38.310> fork<00:03:38.550> would<00:03:38.730> you<00:03:38.820> put<00:03:38.970> it<00:03:39.030> in<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.180> trail

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
120 fork would you put it in the trail

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.180 
120 fork would you put it in the trail
by<00:03:39.570> category<00:03:40.110> or<00:03:40.200> would<00:03:40.440> you<00:03:40.560> still<00:03:40.830> keep<00:03:41.040> it

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
by category or would you still keep it

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.880 
by category or would you still keep it
in<00:03:41.310> more<00:03:41.490> of<00:03:41.550> that<00:03:41.700> race<00:03:42.000> bike<00:03:42.680> category<00:03:43.680> I

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
in more of that race bike category I

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.670 
in more of that race bike category I
think<00:03:44.600> it's<00:03:45.600> kind<00:03:45.780> of<00:03:45.870> almost<00:03:45.990> in<00:03:46.260> between<00:03:46.560> I

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
think it's kind of almost in between I

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.890 
think it's kind of almost in between I
think<00:03:46.830> it<00:03:46.920> gets<00:03:47.040> to<00:03:47.220> be<00:03:47.310> a<00:03:47.370> person<00:03:47.730> who<00:03:47.880> wants<00:03:48.810> a

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
think it gets to be a person who wants a

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.080 
think it gets to be a person who wants a
trail<00:03:49.080> bike<00:03:49.290> but<00:03:49.470> they<00:03:49.560> want<00:03:49.709> it<00:03:49.770> fast<00:03:50.090> with

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
trail bike but they want it fast with

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.490 
trail bike but they want it fast with
the<00:03:51.209> hundred<00:03:51.510> mil<00:03:51.630> front<00:03:51.870> and<00:03:51.990> rear<00:03:52.110> set<00:03:52.350> up

the hundred mil front and rear set up

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.930 
the hundred mil front and rear set up
the<00:03:52.740> type<00:03:52.950> of<00:03:53.100> rider<00:03:53.280> you<00:03:53.520> think<00:03:53.700> is<00:03:53.760> going<00:03:53.880> to

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
the type of rider you think is going to

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.190 
the type of rider you think is going to
benefit<00:03:54.300> the<00:03:54.420> most<00:03:54.450> from<00:03:54.690> that<00:03:54.810> particular

benefit the most from that particular
setup<00:03:55.590> who<00:03:56.430> would<00:03:56.550> you<00:03:56.640> say<00:03:56.790> that<00:03:56.910> is<00:03:57.380> a<00:03:58.380> little

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.910 
or maybe a 100-mile race and type bike
okay<00:04:12.780> so<00:04:12.840> if<00:04:13.020> you<00:04:13.140> were<00:04:13.230> gonna<00:04:13.380> run<00:04:13.620> just<00:04:13.830> a

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
okay so if you were gonna run just a

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.560 
okay so if you were gonna run just a
standard<00:04:14.370> what<00:04:14.910> about<00:04:15.090> 20<00:04:15.420> mile

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
standard what about 20 mile

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.570 
standard what about 20 mile
cross-country<00:04:16.260> rates<00:04:16.500> would<00:04:17.160> this<00:04:17.280> be<00:04:17.460> the

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
cross-country rates would this be the

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:18.670 
cross-country rates would this be the
buy<00:04:17.729> keep<00:04:17.940> it

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
buy keep it

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.890 
buy keep it
over<00:04:19.609> my<00:04:19.760> hardtail<00:04:20.209> or<00:04:20.359> over<00:04:20.570> on<00:04:20.600> longer

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
over my hardtail or over on longer

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.680 
over my hardtail or over on longer
chavez<00:04:21.199> like<00:04:21.380> this<00:04:23.830> so<00:04:24.830> this<00:04:25.370> bike<00:04:25.660> with<00:04:26.660> the

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
chavez like this so this bike with the

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.180 
chavez like this so this bike with the
hundred<00:04:27.020> mil<00:04:27.139> set<00:04:27.350> up<00:04:27.500> would<00:04:27.860> you<00:04:27.949> say<00:04:28.130> you

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
hundred mil set up would you say you

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.460 
hundred mil set up would you say you
mentioned<00:04:28.940> it<00:04:29.090> yeah<00:04:29.600> for<00:04:29.810> 20<00:04:30.080> mile<00:04:30.260> around

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
mentioned it yeah for 20 mile around

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.830 
mentioned it yeah for 20 mile around
those<00:04:30.800> 20<00:04:31.130> mile<00:04:31.250> XC<00:04:31.639> races<00:04:32.060> it's<00:04:32.330> it's<00:04:32.600> a<00:04:32.690> great

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
those 20 mile XC races it's it's a great

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.629 
those 20 mile XC races it's it's a great
choice<00:04:33.169> what<00:04:33.889> about<00:04:34.040> for<00:04:34.220> ultra<00:04:34.520> endurance

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 
choice what about for ultra endurance

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:36.850 
choice what about for ultra endurance
like<00:04:35.030> hundred<00:04:35.360> milers<00:04:35.720> stage<00:04:36.050> races<00:04:36.380> things

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
like hundred milers stage races things

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.939 
like hundred milers stage races things
along<00:04:37.040> those<00:04:37.250> lines<00:04:38.350> maybe<00:04:39.350> it<00:04:39.560> depends<00:04:39.830> I

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:39.949 
along those lines maybe it depends I

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:44.350 
along those lines maybe it depends I
think<00:04:39.979> it<00:04:40.220> depends<00:04:40.610> on<00:04:40.729> how<00:04:40.850> much<00:04:43.120> gravel<00:04:44.120> or

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
think it depends on how much gravel or

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.900 
think it depends on how much gravel or
logging<00:04:45.229> roads<00:04:45.470> there<00:04:45.919> all<00:04:46.040> right<00:04:46.280> so<00:04:46.340> Tonto

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
logging roads there all right so Tonto

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.450 
logging roads there all right so Tonto
pedaling<00:04:47.270> on<00:04:47.360> gravel<00:04:47.840> or<00:04:47.900> logging<00:04:48.290> roads<00:04:48.500> it

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
pedaling on gravel or logging roads it

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.610 
pedaling on gravel or logging roads it
might<00:04:49.610> be<00:04:49.760> better<00:04:49.910> to<00:04:50.000> be<00:04:50.180> on<00:04:50.270> a<00:04:50.300> hardtail<00:04:50.720> this

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
might be better to be on a hardtail this

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.290 
might be better to be on a hardtail this
bike<00:04:51.860> is<00:04:52.070> great<00:04:52.370> where<00:04:52.820> you<00:04:52.910> just<00:04:53.030> sit<00:04:53.270> and

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
bike is great where you just sit and

00:04:53.300 --> 00:05:01.500 
bike is great where you just sit and
pedal<00:04:53.690> the<00:04:53.810> pedal<00:04:53.840> pedal

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.740 

okay<00:05:02.510> so<00:05:03.080> gravel<00:05:03.919> roads<00:05:04.130> dirt<00:05:04.550> roads<00:05:04.820> if<00:05:05.479> it's

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
okay so gravel roads dirt roads if it's

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.150 
okay so gravel roads dirt roads if it's
