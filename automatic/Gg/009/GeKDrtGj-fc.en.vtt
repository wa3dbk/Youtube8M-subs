00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.099
 jack everything again at the start and times 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:22.500
 back on the channel of german top 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:26.039
 gameplay and in the background we see 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.470
 a two-minute nuclear six against 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.529
 six dominion on the map slums with 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.210
 the ska handles and creates as 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.220
 berkshire doing lightweight and 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.620
 hardliner skill and looters and 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.080
 skill and completion series drone 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.690
 in the orbital satellite and the erp and 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.800
 the gameplays of freak model is it 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.860
 of course, from him down in the 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.440
 description and really two minutes 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.969
 locklear there six to six, then 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.680
 i can understand it so multi team or 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.480
 so position or I'll tell 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.039
 sprengkommando was the only way off and 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.649
 to spawn and I sport sometimes 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.100
 all six are so blatantly against 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.570
 Six reign and the spawn stairs 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.640
 yes i do not want to say it so intensely 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.140
 as with Sprengkommando keep little 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.420
 but you also take the question then 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.039
 and so and it 's not just sport 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.020
 really slipped around a bit two 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:16.110
 Minutes nuclear as really fat 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.149
 really thanks for this gameplay and 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.520
 I do not know when you will see the video 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.250
 but yesterday the new xbox became 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.679
 one presents 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:28.020
 and yes I just want to ask you 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:30.179
 what you expect for the xbox 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.310
 So you have one now 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:34.470
 voice control you say the xbox 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.270
 then the xbox goes on you are in 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.610
 main menu and moves the arm to the left 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.590
 or to the right and then swing too 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.289
 the main menu so left you look 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.770
 television says jo joins rtl 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:48.420
 then he switched to rtl like that and so 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.140
 of course, the television is not in the 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.459
 xbox in it 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.289
 I think that forgot a few you 

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:53.880
 of course, then have to have sky for what 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.789
 he now with the normal xbox he too 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.149
 but already goes this voice control 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:02.369
 you should come before the one 3 so 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.860
 state power turns off the xbox and then leaves 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.259
 an xbox from crass to all 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.280
 also very easily natural for 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.400
 dashboard there are such a few 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.280
 Specialists the many eschborn and 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.020
 then just a few bad times 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.280
 gameplay and just do something 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.840
 spot on 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.030
 and then the xbox is on again so needs 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.739
 its two minutes is clear again 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.209
 almost over two minutes 17 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.890
 I hope you do not say how 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.830
 the 17 seconds i believe in it 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.850
 you shit 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.110
 I would be glad if you have this 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.460

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.780

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.160

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.710

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.710
