don't think I had that much of an
adrenaline<00:00:53.520> rush<00:00:53.969> but<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.050> seemed<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.410> me<00:00:55.440> like

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
adrenaline rush but it seemed to me like

close on my ears as much and the saw
seems<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.119> bit<00:01:42.270> louder<00:01:42.509> when<00:01:42.750> I'm<00:01:42.840> using<00:01:42.990> this

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
seems a bit louder when I'm using this

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.950 
seems a bit louder when I'm using this
and<00:01:43.770> otherwise<00:01:44.490> I'm<00:01:44.790> getting<00:01:45.329> used<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.600> it

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
and otherwise I'm getting used to it

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:53.480 
and otherwise I'm getting used to it
and<00:01:47.000> then<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.030> also<00:01:48.270> got<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:51.619> got<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.649> 9<00:01:52.920> layer<00:01:53.159> pair

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
and then I also got I got a 9 layer pair

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.510 
and then I also got I got a 9 layer pair
of<00:01:53.610> chaps<00:01:53.880> here<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.860> these<00:01:55.860> are<00:01:56.070> another<00:01:56.280> one

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
of chaps here and these are another one

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.770 
of chaps here and these are another one
that<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.909> know<00:01:57.090> in<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.270> winter<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.600> think

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
that you know in the winter I think

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.899 
that you know in the winter I think
that's<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.259> great<00:01:58.469> thing<00:01:58.710> but<00:01:59.460> in<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.640> summer

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
that's a great thing but in the summer

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.719 
that's a great thing but in the summer
boy<00:02:00.180> these<00:02:00.390> things<00:02:00.450> certainly<00:02:01.110> do<00:02:01.729> they

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
boy these things certainly do they

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.230 
boy these things certainly do they
certainly<00:02:03.119> do<00:02:03.360> get<00:02:03.570> hot<00:02:04.759> but<00:02:05.759> these<00:02:05.969> are<00:02:06.149> the

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
certainly do get hot but these are the

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.960 
certainly do get hot but these are the
ones<00:02:06.420> steel<00:02:06.750> makes<00:02:07.049> they're<00:02:07.290> 9<00:02:07.469> layer<00:02:07.970> they

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
ones steel makes they're 9 layer they

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.990 
ones steel makes they're 9 layer they
don't<00:02:09.179> have<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.450> wraparound

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
don't have the wraparound

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.310 
don't have the wraparound
so<00:02:11.360> if<00:02:11.480> you<00:02:11.570> want<00:02:11.750> to<00:02:11.840> see<00:02:11.990> what<00:02:12.170> they<00:02:12.290> look

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
so if you want to see what they look

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.150 
so if you want to see what they look
like<00:02:12.760> this<00:02:13.760> is<00:02:13.940> it

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
like this is it

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:22.030 
like this is it
and<00:02:16.480> it's<00:02:17.480> getting<00:02:17.780> to<00:02:17.840> be<00:02:17.870> full<00:02:20.230> so<00:02:21.230> you<00:02:21.890> know

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
and it's getting to be full so you know

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.620 
and it's getting to be full so you know
it's<00:02:22.310> not<00:02:22.460> really<00:02:22.790> that<00:02:22.820> uncomfortable<00:02:23.270> to

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
it's not really that uncomfortable to

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.010 
it's not really that uncomfortable to
wear<00:02:23.810> them<00:02:24.820> but<00:02:25.820> you<00:02:26.240> know<00:02:26.390> we've<00:02:26.600> all<00:02:26.780> heard

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
wear them but you know we've all heard

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.510 
wear them but you know we've all heard
stories<00:02:27.470> about<00:02:27.500> people<00:02:27.950> getting<00:02:28.070> hurt<00:02:28.340> with<00:02:28.460> a

stories about people getting hurt with a

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.690 
stories about people getting hurt with a

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
chainsaw and I've been using one long

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.370 
chainsaw and I've been using one long
enough<00:02:32.030> that<00:02:32.210> I<00:02:32.300> think<00:02:32.510> I'd<00:02:32.660> you<00:02:33.050> know<00:02:33.080> better

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:40.720 
enough that I think I'd you know better
be<00:02:33.560> safe<00:02:33.800> before<00:02:34.280> something<00:02:34.490> does<00:02:34.790> happen<00:02:39.730> so

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
be safe before something does happen so
