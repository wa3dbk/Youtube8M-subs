really skinny piece just throw one
underneath<00:02:03.100> and<00:02:03.539> screw<00:02:04.539> up<00:02:04.720> on<00:02:05.820> on<00:02:06.820> either

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
underneath and screw up on on either

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.389 
underneath and screw up on on either
side<00:02:07.390> so<00:02:07.659> you<00:02:08.140> have<00:02:08.410> like<00:02:08.769> a<00:02:08.800> screw<00:02:09.100> there<00:02:09.280> and

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
side so you have like a screw there and

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.540 
side so you have like a screw there and
a<00:02:09.459> screw<00:02:09.700> there<00:02:09.910> that<00:02:10.750> way<00:02:10.869> you<00:02:10.989> got<00:02:11.550> these

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
a screw there that way you got these

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.220 
a screw there that way you got these
better<00:02:13.000> for<00:02:13.360> sure<00:02:13.390> together<00:02:13.900> they're<00:02:14.110> not

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
better for sure together they're not

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.690 
better for sure together they're not
gonna<00:02:14.380> move<00:02:14.650> or<00:02:14.920> separate<00:02:15.400> or<00:02:15.430> anything

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
gonna move or separate or anything

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.150 
gonna move or separate or anything
that's<00:02:16.420> three<00:02:16.690> quarters<00:02:16.900> so<00:02:17.260> like<00:02:17.440> I<00:02:17.709> can't

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
that's three quarters so like I can't

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.020 
that's three quarters so like I can't
really<00:02:18.430> move<00:02:18.760> that<00:02:19.030> too<00:02:19.269> much<00:02:19.480> as<00:02:19.989> it<00:02:20.319> is<00:02:20.470> and

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
really move that too much as it is and

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.520 
really move that too much as it is and
I'm<00:02:22.030> putting<00:02:22.390> Hamill<00:02:22.870> on<00:02:22.900> it<00:02:23.110> so<00:02:23.230> it's<00:02:23.350> kind<00:02:23.500> of

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
I'm putting Hamill on it so it's kind of

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.150 
I'm putting Hamill on it so it's kind of
heavy<00:02:23.680> but<00:02:25.230> it<00:02:26.230> seems<00:02:26.470> to<00:02:26.590> be<00:02:26.680> doing<00:02:26.830> not<00:02:27.040> too

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
heavy but it seems to be doing not too

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.130 
heavy but it seems to be doing not too
bad<00:02:27.340> so<00:02:27.870> yeah

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
bad so yeah

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
quick little modification and you've got

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.710 
quick little modification and you've got
yourself<00:02:32.709> working<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.400> ammo<00:02:33.640> cabinet<00:02:34.030> that's

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
yourself working the ammo cabinet that's

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.870 
yourself working the ammo cabinet that's
frickin<00:02:35.319> huge<00:02:35.680> I<00:02:36.040> don't<00:02:36.130> even<00:02:36.459> know<00:02:36.670> how<00:02:36.819> many

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
frickin huge I don't even know how many

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.690 
frickin huge I don't even know how many
rounds<00:02:37.239> I<00:02:37.330> can<00:02:37.480> put<00:02:37.630> in<00:02:37.750> this<00:02:38.220> probably<00:02:39.220> quite

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
rounds I can put in this probably quite

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.080 
rounds I can put in this probably quite
a<00:02:39.760> few<00:02:39.819> thousand<00:02:40.450> I<00:02:41.580> doubt<00:02:42.580> I'll<00:02:42.730> ever<00:02:42.760> have

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
the money to fill it but like I say it's

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.690 
the money to fill it but like I say it's
good<00:02:46.150> storage<00:02:46.540> for<00:02:46.810> other<00:02:46.930> stuff<00:02:47.290> so<00:02:47.700> whatever

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700
