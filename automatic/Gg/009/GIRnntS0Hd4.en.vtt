is<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.130> checkpoint<00:00:29.550> we're<00:00:29.730> talking<00:00:30.000> about<00:00:30.090> just

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
is a checkpoint we're talking about just

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.790 
is a checkpoint we're talking about just
before<00:00:30.750> actually<00:00:31.080> encountering<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.650> boss

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
before actually encountering the boss

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.979 
before actually encountering the boss
itself<00:00:32.279> once<00:00:33.000> you've<00:00:33.180> gotten<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.510> checkpoint

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
itself once you've gotten the checkpoint

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.440 
itself once you've gotten the checkpoint
then<00:00:34.350> you're<00:00:34.469> set<00:00:34.770> for<00:00:35.040> your<00:00:35.160> running<00:00:35.489> for

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
then you're set for your running for

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.970 
then you're set for your running for
your<00:00:36.570> farming<00:00:36.930> runs<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.380> so<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:37.620> can<00:00:37.800> go

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
your farming runs and so you can go

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.100 
your farming runs and so you can go
ahead<00:00:38.250> leave<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.700> game<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.180> then<00:00:39.750> just<00:00:39.930> press

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
ahead leave the game and then just press

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.410 
ahead leave the game and then just press
on<00:00:40.290> resume<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.920> start<00:00:41.760> your<00:00:41.879> farming<00:00:42.239> runs

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
on resume and start your farming runs

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.540 
on resume and start your farming runs
now<00:00:43.110> there<00:00:43.320> are<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.410> few<00:00:43.649> things<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.160> note<00:00:44.280> here

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
now there are a few things to note here

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.180 
now there are a few things to note here
on<00:00:44.730> this<00:00:45.090> area's<00:00:45.450> can<00:00:45.719> be<00:00:45.840> strongly<00:00:46.530> mobbed<00:00:46.950> so

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
on this area's can be strongly mobbed so

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.920 
on this area's can be strongly mobbed so
not<00:00:47.340> every<00:00:47.640> class<00:00:47.910> can<00:00:48.210> encounter<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.780> and

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
not every class can encounter it and

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.510 
not every class can encounter it and
here's<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.739> spot<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.190> want<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.399> head

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
here's the spot that you want to head

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.880 
here's the spot that you want to head
over<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:51.329> can<00:00:51.690> obviously<00:00:52.050> be<00:00:52.230> closed<00:00:52.710> at

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
over to it can obviously be closed at

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.500 
over to it can obviously be closed at
times<00:00:53.129> because<00:00:53.399> it's<00:00:53.670> an<00:00:53.789> optional<00:00:54.180> dungeon

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
times because it's an optional dungeon

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.209 
times because it's an optional dungeon
so<00:00:54.780> if<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.590> case<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.800> would<00:00:56.070> just

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
so if that is the case you would just

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.889 
so if that is the case you would just
want<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.460> leave<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.730> game<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.120> go<00:00:57.660> ahead<00:00:57.780> and

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
want to leave the game and go ahead and

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.930 
want to leave the game and go ahead and
make<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.079> new<00:00:58.260> game<00:00:58.500> resumed<00:00:58.890> go<00:00:59.399> back<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.820> your

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
make a new game resumed go back to your

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.569 
make a new game resumed go back to your
checkpoint<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.629> check<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:00.989> out<00:01:01.050> again<00:01:01.579> now

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
checkpoint and check it out again now

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.820 
checkpoint and check it out again now
the<00:01:02.640> spot<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.359> called<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.780> underbridge<00:01:04.470> and

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
the spot is called the underbridge and

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.429 
the spot is called the underbridge and
can<00:01:05.670> easily<00:01:05.820> be<00:01:06.000> accessible<00:01:06.600> there<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.260> go

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
can easily be accessible there you go

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.490 
can easily be accessible there you go
now<00:01:08.280> we've<00:01:09.030> pretty<00:01:09.479> much<00:01:09.600> been<00:01:09.720> posting<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> lot

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
now we've pretty much been posting a lot

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.380 
now we've pretty much been posting a lot
of<00:01:10.590> videos<00:01:10.799> on<00:01:10.890> how<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.070> farm<00:01:11.369> chess<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.240> lot

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
of videos on how to farm chess and a lot

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.880 
of videos on how to farm chess and a lot
of<00:01:12.450> them<00:01:12.540> have<00:01:12.780> been<00:01:12.930> fixed<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.380> nerfed<00:01:13.590> and

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
of them have been fixed and nerfed and

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.980 
of them have been fixed and nerfed and
Exploited<00:01:14.369> however<00:01:14.670> this<00:01:15.180> one<00:01:15.450> probably<00:01:15.720> will

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
Exploited however this one probably will

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.330 
Exploited however this one probably will
not<00:01:16.110> be<00:01:16.259> fixed<00:01:16.560> just<00:01:16.590> because<00:01:16.920> it's<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.159> little

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
not be fixed just because it's a little

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.740 
not be fixed just because it's a little
bit<00:01:17.430> trickier<00:01:17.850> as<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.090> can<00:01:18.240> see<00:01:18.450> there<00:01:18.630> are

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
bit trickier as you can see there are

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.929 
bit trickier as you can see there are
elite<00:01:19.110> mobs<00:01:19.470> at<00:01:19.680> times<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.280> they<00:01:20.369> pretty<00:01:20.820> much

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
elite mobs at times and they pretty much

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.999 
elite mobs at times and they pretty much
are<00:01:21.090> going<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.299> own<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.500> just<00:01:22.590> want<00:01:22.890> to

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
are going to own you so you just want to

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.910 
are going to own you so you just want to
watch<00:01:23.820> out<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.450> I'm<00:01:24.930> almost<00:01:25.229> certain<00:01:25.770> that

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
watch out and I'm almost certain that

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.590 
watch out and I'm almost certain that
this<00:01:26.189> spot<00:01:26.460> will<00:01:26.640> not<00:01:26.759> be<00:01:26.939> fixed<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:27.450> it's

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
this spot will not be fixed so it's

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.510 
this spot will not be fixed so it's
going<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.320> be<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.470> great<00:01:28.710> place<00:01:29.009> for<00:01:29.310> some<00:01:29.430> of

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
going to be a great place for some of

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.399 
going to be a great place for some of
the<00:01:29.610> more<00:01:29.759> experienced<00:01:30.180> players<00:01:30.329> they<00:01:31.229> can

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
the more experienced players they can

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.670 
the more experienced players they can
tackle<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.920> now<00:01:32.310> every<00:01:32.869> class<00:01:33.869> can<00:01:34.290> do<00:01:34.500> this

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
tackle it now every class can do this

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.770 
tackle it now every class can do this
but<00:01:34.920> more<00:01:35.130> classes<00:01:35.549> obviously<00:01:36.060> will<00:01:36.509> have<00:01:36.689> an

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
but more classes obviously will have an

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.270 
but more classes obviously will have an
easier<00:01:36.930> time<00:01:37.140> we<00:01:37.590> found<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.040> demon

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
easier time we found that the demon

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.649 
easier time we found that the demon
hunter<00:01:38.549> is<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.759> most<00:01:38.909> efficient<00:01:39.360> one<00:01:39.479> in

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
hunter is the most efficient one in

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.050 
hunter is the most efficient one in
doing<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:40.020> however<00:01:40.890> if<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.369> have<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.640> wizard

doing this however if you have a wizard

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.719 
doing this however if you have a wizard
then<00:01:42.329> with<00:01:43.170> wormhole<00:01:43.740> disjoint<00:01:44.310> should<00:01:44.640> be

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
then with wormhole disjoint should be

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.490 
then with wormhole disjoint should be
able<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.210> do<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.420> as<00:01:45.540> well<00:01:45.570> or<00:01:45.960> with<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.290> witch

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
the checkpoint is very mobbed at times

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.850 
the checkpoint is very mobbed at times
and<00:01:54.360> it's<00:01:54.479> somewhat<00:01:54.840> tricky<00:01:55.110> now<00:01:55.500> if<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:55.740> do

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
and it's somewhat tricky now if you do

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.120 
and it's somewhat tricky now if you do
this<00:01:56.009> area<00:01:56.820> or<00:01:57.060> if<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.570> form<00:01:58.110> this<00:01:58.290> spot<00:01:58.590> often

this area or if you form this spot often

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.410 
this area or if you form this spot often
you<00:01:59.250> will<00:01:59.340> notice<00:01:59.579> that<00:01:59.700> there<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.030> pretty

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
you will notice that there is pretty

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.420 
you will notice that there is pretty
much<00:02:00.509> only<00:02:00.689> for<00:02:01.020> layouts<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.070> the

much only for layouts to it and the

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.060 
much only for layouts to it and the

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
times they'll also spawn in the middle

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.449 
times they'll also spawn in the middle
however<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.200> pretty<00:02:07.500> much<00:02:07.530> can't<00:02:07.920> miss<00:02:08.250> the

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
idea of where it's at times they can

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.300 
idea of where it's at times they can
spawn<00:04:51.960> and<00:04:52.320> how<00:04:52.530> you<00:04:52.590> need<00:04:52.830> to<00:04:52.950> really<00:04:53.190> go

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
spawn and how you need to really go

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.220 
spawn and how you need to really go
through<00:04:53.550> the<00:04:53.670> dungeon<00:04:53.970> on<00:04:54.120> those<00:04:54.660> three<00:04:54.930> paths

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230 
through the dungeon on those three paths

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.070 
through the dungeon on those three paths
to<00:04:55.500> explore<00:04:55.800> it<00:04:55.890> in<00:04:55.980> its<00:04:56.130> entirety<00:04:57.080> obviously

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
to explore it in its entirety obviously

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.960 
to explore it in its entirety obviously
it's<00:04:58.200> times<00:04:58.500> then<00:04:58.770> the<00:04:58.950> shredder<00:04:59.310> chess<00:04:59.520> can

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
it's times then the shredder chess can

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.370 
it's times then the shredder chess can
also<00:05:00.090> spawn<00:05:00.360> the<00:05:00.480> middle<00:05:00.660> map<00:05:00.870> but<00:05:01.080> as<00:05:01.170> you<00:05:01.290> can

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
also spawn the middle map but as you can

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.560 
also spawn the middle map but as you can

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.950 
unlikely to miss that treasure chest if
you<00:05:05.490> just<00:05:05.640> go<00:05:05.790> through<00:05:06.030> the<00:05:06.150> three<00:05:06.330> paths<00:05:06.630> and

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
you just go through the three paths and

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.840 
you just go through the three paths and
then<00:05:07.740> just<00:05:07.890> make<00:05:08.070> sure<00:05:08.250> that<00:05:08.280> you<00:05:08.430> also<00:05:08.610> get

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
then just make sure that you also get

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.270 
then just make sure that you also get
the<00:05:09.000> shrine<00:05:09.300> on<00:05:09.570> your<00:05:09.750> way<00:05:09.840> over<00:05:10.020> there<00:05:10.290> again

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
the shrine on your way over there again

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.360 
the shrine on your way over there again
the<00:05:11.610> layout<00:05:12.090> is<00:05:12.390> in<00:05:13.320> a<00:05:13.470> sense<00:05:13.680> it<00:05:13.860> has<00:05:14.010> four

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
the layout is in a sense it has four

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.340 
the layout is in a sense it has four

corners that you want to then go over to
and<00:05:18.360> as<00:05:18.510> long<00:05:18.660> as<00:05:18.810> you<00:05:18.870> follow<00:05:19.020> the<00:05:19.140> three

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.470 
and as long as you follow the three
paths<00:05:19.620> then<00:05:19.830> you<00:05:19.890> should<00:05:20.040> have<00:05:20.070> no<00:05:20.220> trouble

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:20.480 
paths then you should have no trouble

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.780 
paths then you should have no trouble
now<00:05:21.590> that's<00:05:22.590> all<00:05:22.860> there<00:05:23.010> really<00:05:23.070> is<00:05:23.280> to<00:05:23.400> say

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
now that's all there really is to say

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.910 
now that's all there really is to say
it's<00:05:24.360> somewhat<00:05:25.080> tricky<00:05:25.320> so<00:05:25.530> as<00:05:25.620> I<00:05:25.800> was<00:05:25.830> saying

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:25.920 
it's somewhat tricky so as I was saying

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.680 
it's somewhat tricky so as I was saying
you<00:05:26.220> really<00:05:26.610> want<00:05:26.790> to<00:05:26.910> be<00:05:27.000> more<00:05:27.570> of<00:05:27.600> an

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
you really want to be more of an

you really want to be more of an
experienced<00:05:28.110> player<00:05:28.260> else<00:05:28.650> it<00:05:29.430> won't<00:05:29.640> be<00:05:29.790> as

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
experienced player else it won't be as

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.660 
experienced player else it won't be as
efficient<00:05:30.420> for<00:05:30.600> you<00:05:30.690> as<00:05:30.810> other<00:05:31.050> spots<00:05:31.670> however
