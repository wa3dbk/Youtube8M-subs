like happen yeah don't chip don't jump

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.660 
like happen yeah don't chip don't jump
over<00:01:46.580> too<00:01:46.729> much<00:01:47.350> because<00:01:48.350> then<00:01:48.530> that<00:01:49.039> will

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
over too much because then that will

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.450 
over too much because then that will
happen<00:01:49.789> you'll<00:01:50.390> just<00:01:50.539> go<00:01:50.869> flying<00:01:51.140> over<00:01:51.500> yeah
