called I strobo soft and what Peterson
tuners<00:01:54.710> kind<00:01:55.310> of<00:01:55.430> prides<00:01:55.700> itself<00:01:55.850> with<00:01:56.360> is

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
tuners kind of prides itself with is

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.200 
tuners kind of prides itself with is
this<00:01:57.290> strobe<00:01:58.010> tuner<00:01:58.250> in<00:01:58.490> the<00:01:58.610> application

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
this strobe tuner in the application

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.090 
this strobe tuner in the application
right<00:01:59.780> now<00:01:59.930> it's<00:02:00.080> going<00:02:00.200> to<00:02:00.260> say<00:02:00.440> no<00:02:00.680> input

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
right now it's going to say no input

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.380 
right now it's going to say no input
because<00:02:01.400> we<00:02:01.550> actually<00:02:01.670> don't<00:02:02.030> have<00:02:02.240> the

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
because we actually don't have the

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.750 
because we actually don't have the
microphone<00:02:02.870> in<00:02:03.080> yet<00:02:03.290> but<00:02:03.860> before<00:02:04.010> we<00:02:04.460> put<00:02:04.640> the

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
now before we get the review started I

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.930 
now before we get the review started I
actually<00:02:37.500> have<00:02:37.770> the<00:02:37.890> guitar<00:02:38.040> off<00:02:38.550> screen

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
actually have the guitar off screen

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.580 
actually have the guitar off screen
which<00:02:39.210> I'm<00:02:39.360> going<00:02:39.450> to<00:02:39.540> strum<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:39.810> few<00:02:40.050> keys<00:02:40.320> are

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
which I'm going to strum a few keys are

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.610 
which I'm going to strum a few keys are
a<00:02:40.650> few<00:02:41.010> notes<00:02:41.250> with<00:02:41.520> when<00:02:42.420> I<00:02:42.450> first<00:02:43.140> saw<00:02:43.410> this

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
a few notes with when I first saw this

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.020 
a few notes with when I first saw this
strobe<00:02:43.950> tuner<00:02:44.130> I<00:02:44.310> was<00:02:44.459> actually<00:02:44.640> kind<00:02:44.970> of

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
strobe tuner I was actually kind of

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.970 
strobe tuner I was actually kind of
indifferent<00:02:45.360> about<00:02:45.660> it<00:02:45.990> didn't<00:02:46.170> really<00:02:46.290> know

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
indifferent about it didn't really know

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.220 
indifferent about it didn't really know
anything<00:02:47.700> about<00:02:47.940> a<00:02:48.150> strobe<00:02:48.540> tuner<00:02:48.720> but<00:02:49.020> now

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
anything about a strobe tuner but now

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.900 
anything about a strobe tuner but now
that<00:02:49.470> I've<00:02:49.590> actually<00:02:49.740> started<00:02:50.100> using<00:02:50.640> this

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
that I've actually started using this

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.990 
that I've actually started using this
tuner<00:02:51.240> I<00:02:51.560> can<00:02:52.560> now<00:02:52.709> see<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.130> accuracy<00:02:53.820> that

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
tuner I can now see the accuracy that

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.120 
tuner I can now see the accuracy that
this<00:02:54.180> tuner<00:02:54.660> offers<00:02:55.050> that<00:02:55.230> most<00:02:55.500> other<00:02:55.709> tuners

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
this tuner offers that most other tuners

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.610 
this tuner offers that most other tuners
don't<00:02:56.370> offer<00:02:56.580> also<00:02:56.940> before<00:02:57.900> i<00:02:57.930> get<00:02:58.200> into<00:02:58.230> the

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
don't offer also before i get into the

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.729 
don't offer also before i get into the
review<00:02:59.070> i<00:02:59.100> want<00:02:59.310> to<00:02:59.400> note<00:02:59.580> to<00:03:00.209> other<00:03:00.739> buttons

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
review i want to note to other buttons

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.110 
review i want to note to other buttons
here<00:03:01.950> in<00:03:02.040> this<00:03:02.190> application<00:03:02.370> we<00:03:02.820> have<00:03:02.970> our

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
here in this application we have our

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.210 
here in this application we have our
noise<00:03:03.390> filter<00:03:03.930> which<00:03:04.470> right<00:03:04.709> now<00:03:04.739> it's<00:03:05.130> kind

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
noise filter which right now it's kind

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.860 
noise filter which right now it's kind
of<00:03:05.370> picking<00:03:05.730> up<00:03:05.850> a<00:03:05.940> lot<00:03:06.150> of<00:03:06.180> noise<00:03:06.480> i<00:03:06.690> can

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
of picking up a lot of noise i can

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.780 
of picking up a lot of noise i can
actually<00:03:07.020> put<00:03:07.350> that<00:03:07.470> noise<00:03:07.709> filter<00:03:08.190> on<00:03:08.430> and

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
actually put that noise filter on and

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.030 
actually put that noise filter on and
it's<00:03:09.480> going<00:03:09.690> to<00:03:09.840> dampen<00:03:10.410> a<00:03:10.530> lot<00:03:10.709> of<00:03:10.800> the<00:03:10.890> noise

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
it's going to dampen a lot of the noise

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.650 
it's going to dampen a lot of the noise
that's<00:03:11.370> coming<00:03:11.700> fruit<00:03:11.940> through<00:03:12.300> i'm<00:03:12.450> going<00:03:12.600> to

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
that's coming fruit through i'm going to

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.420 
that's coming fruit through i'm going to
take<00:03:12.810> that<00:03:12.989> off<00:03:13.110> right<00:03:13.320> now<00:03:13.470> and<00:03:13.709> we<00:03:14.070> also<00:03:14.250> have

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
take that off right now and we also have

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.520 
take that off right now and we also have
an<00:03:14.700> input<00:03:14.970> boost<00:03:15.540> so<00:03:15.780> if<00:03:15.900> you<00:03:16.020> want<00:03:16.260> to<00:03:16.320> kind<00:03:16.500> of

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
an input boost so if you want to kind of

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.320 
an input boost so if you want to kind of
boost<00:03:16.800> the<00:03:17.070> signal<00:03:17.280> that<00:03:17.610> your<00:03:17.730> microphone<00:03:18.209> is

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
getting you can put this input boost

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.229 
getting you can put this input boost
we're<00:03:20.370> obviously<00:03:20.489> not<00:03:20.760> going<00:03:20.970> to<00:03:21.060> do<00:03:21.209> that

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239
