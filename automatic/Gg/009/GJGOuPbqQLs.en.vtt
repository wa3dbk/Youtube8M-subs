00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.879
 I welcome you my dear 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:17.880
 friends and today we will sort out such a lesson 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:21.000
 how to put the sound on hackintosh 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:26.550
 and also set it up and so for that 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:30.509
 we need a cupcake of utilities this text here 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.600
 This file and if it did not help you 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.230
 here are some texts for 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.649
 checks 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:45.480
 I think you will understand so open the text 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:48.929
 telit asks for a password and so here he is 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.659
 takes into account the gift of different ways 

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:55.499
 so it doesn't matter what we do we 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:57.749
 we throw this cupcake over the court but only 

00:00:55.499 --> 00:01:00.870
 after here here is all this 

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:04.229
 I will not do this because 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:08.490
 as I already have the sound I do not want 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.890
 re-configure everything so we 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.190
 we drop the text here waiting 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.729
 installation close the text utilities for an hour 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:21.409
 it will not close as the process goes 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:26.360
 so then we open this file with 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:29.850
 extension until r and start the installation 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:34.430
 after we installed it we go 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:37.049
 in the settings and go to this tab 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.020
 so here it is necessary here with me 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.950
 worth all of the silence like this and here 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.049
 can choose 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.960
 I have the top I will choose now 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.619
 here you need to set the lower ones 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.619
 Here are the settings 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.950
 all that is if you strongly court for 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:01.590
 sharing it will break very badly 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:08.820
 speakers but it works for me as well 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:11.460
 sound how it works so sound that is all 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.830
 OK, I set the default like 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.170
 I put up and notice when you 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.750
 choose the bottom line here here is 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:23.610
 still various settings are exactly possible 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:27.650
 set up a microphone in addition here 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:32.060
 already not all thank you for your attention
