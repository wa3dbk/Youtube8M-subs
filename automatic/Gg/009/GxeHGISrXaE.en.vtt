 be more crappy honestly but at 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.810

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:46.570
 to the day or the mess or whatever and taps a 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.780
 little friends that poor people do not have 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:54.720
 tuned or anything and that is also with 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.720
 advantage there you have to catch the remains 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:05.750

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:08.960

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.910
 there is aspired strength but then I have some 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.650
 you want kids to come out the black 23 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.680
 the betty is there to the brim of all 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.120
 ways I have like three gameplays that I 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.210
 It seems that I was commenting on it. 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:23.870
 I say I have three gameplays there are saved 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:26.150
 that I will upload them just for when the beta 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.730
 or a little bit before the beta you know 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:32.150
 I'm going to take it and I'm going to upload it there 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:33.680
 power cap to give you a little bit like 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.770
 of envy you do not have to pay is for a 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.900
 little hype there is just before the goal 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:45.530
 that may be very sorry you did not have 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:50.680
 there powerful pom pom pom pom pom pom pom 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:50.680
 pom pom pom pom pom pom 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.600
 Let's go, Let's go, Let's go, Let's go 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:08.200
 well here 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:10.900
 but no no no no that's normal 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.940
 but the one that more to the right my son is 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:16.150
 the one that stops the heat and wants to give 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:19.150
 a may so I have not told them anything 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:21.169
 I know how much the third one will have left me 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:24.930
 past 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:29.090
 let's see what I'm supposed to think 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:29.090
 that the verbena has passed 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:37.110
 Black battles always take to think 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:37.110
 that he had spent uncle alvarito 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:43.610
 Álvaro Álvaro Álvaro 

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:46.340
 or iron 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:48.590
 it was a good bluff to dance them what 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.090
 said until here the race the vacation 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.669
 fast but do not worry that you 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:54.919
 we will compensate already lately I will catch 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:56.210
 I will give a lot of reed to the channel aside 

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:58.370
 I want to catch and climb 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:01.039
 Archette too and nothing I'm going to 

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:03.650
 compensate two worry I am pleasantly 

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:06.169
 because it is that it is a bit this way more 

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:09.439
 short so were kids told him a 

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:12.860
 embrace very very big enjoy it to 

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:16.300
 I really saw her in life and nothing 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.300
 you know, see you later
