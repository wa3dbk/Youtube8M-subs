00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
the blank routes while I cap that flag

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.590 
the blank routes while I cap that flag
and<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.430> also<00:01:32.610> make<00:01:32.909> sure<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:33.360> if<00:01:33.450> I'm

standing on the beef leg so that I can
get<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.530> points<00:01:37.890> for<00:01:38.369> shooting<00:01:38.700> somebody

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
get the points for shooting somebody

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.390 
get the points for shooting somebody
who's<00:01:39.750> trying<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.140> come<00:01:40.350> captive<00:01:40.770> II<00:01:40.890> flag<00:01:41.159> or

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
who's trying to come captive II flag or

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.219 
who's trying to come captive II flag or
someone<00:01:41.729> who's<00:01:41.850> shooting<00:01:42.119> at<00:01:42.210> me<00:01:42.420> if<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:43.020> win

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
someone who's shooting at me if I win

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.590 
someone who's shooting at me if I win
the<00:01:43.350> gunfight<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:44.009> means<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.310> get<00:01:44.369> 125<00:01:45.180> points

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
the gunfight that means I get 125 points

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.630 
the gunfight that means I get 125 points
and<00:01:45.930> then<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.740> can<00:01:47.040> pick<00:01:47.189> up<00:01:47.310> my<00:01:47.430> killstreaks

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
and then I can pick up my killstreaks

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.670 
and then I can pick up my killstreaks
and<00:01:48.060> also<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.509> believe<00:01:48.630> if<00:01:49.020> you're<00:01:49.170> standing<00:01:49.380> on

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
and also I believe if you're standing on

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.499 
and also I believe if you're standing on
the<00:01:49.890> flag<00:01:50.189> or<00:01:50.490> if<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.700> call<00:01:50.939> in<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.149> kill<00:01:51.420> streak

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
the flag or if you call in a kill streak

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.539 
the flag or if you call in a kill streak
on<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.990> flag<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.560> think<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.220> actually

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
on the flag I think that that actually

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.340 
on the flag I think that that actually
does<00:01:54.000> add<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.479> your<00:01:54.630> score<00:01:54.899> streak<00:01:55.229> it

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
does add to your score streak it

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.660 
does add to your score streak it
increases<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.890> amount<00:01:56.040> of<00:01:56.250> points<00:01:56.430> that<00:01:56.549> you

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
increases the amount of points that you

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.580 
increases the amount of points that you
get<00:01:56.939> so<00:01:57.450> here<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.719> can<00:01:57.750> see<00:01:58.049> I'm<00:01:58.170> already<00:01:58.350> up

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
get so here you can see I'm already up

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.340 
get so here you can see I'm already up
on<00:01:58.710> my<00:01:58.829> VTOL<00:01:59.250> warship<00:01:59.549> I<00:01:59.969> already<00:02:00.960> called<00:02:01.229> the

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
on my VTOL warship I already called the

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.620 
on my VTOL warship I already called the
Blackbird<00:02:01.829> in<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.640> was<00:02:02.790> able<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.119> pick<00:02:03.540> up

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
Blackbird in and I was able to pick up

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.090 
Blackbird in and I was able to pick up
these<00:02:03.780> scorestreaks<00:02:04.259> really<00:02:04.619> really<00:02:04.890> quickly

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
these scorestreaks really really quickly

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.530 
these scorestreaks really really quickly
and<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.460> reason<00:02:05.759> for<00:02:05.790> that<00:02:05.939> is<00:02:06.149> because<00:02:06.180> of

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
and the reason for that is because of

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.940 
and the reason for that is because of
the<00:02:06.659> amount<00:02:06.869> of<00:02:06.990> points<00:02:07.170> in<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.469> objectives

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
the amount of points in the objectives

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.740 
the amount of points in the objectives
that<00:02:08.039> i<00:02:08.160> was<00:02:08.340> playing<00:02:08.610> now<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:09.300> lot<00:02:09.509> of<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.720> guys

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
that i was playing now a lot of you guys

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.110 
that i was playing now a lot of you guys
may<00:02:10.170> not<00:02:10.319> like<00:02:10.590> objectives<00:02:11.190> play<00:02:11.400> but<00:02:11.910> if<00:02:12.000> you

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
may not like objectives play but if you

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.640 
may not like objectives play but if you
guys<00:02:12.270> want<00:02:12.629> to<00:02:12.750> get<00:02:12.840> these<00:02:13.050> streets

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
guys want to get these streets

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.319

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:15.329 
you want to get this gameplay and you

you want to get this gameplay and you
want<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.629> get<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.870> W<00:02:16.260> this<00:02:16.530> is<00:02:16.680> exactly<00:02:16.980> how

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:17.189 
want to get the W this is exactly how

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:19.460 
want to get the W this is exactly how
you<00:02:17.340> have<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.790> play<00:02:17.970> you<00:02:18.180> have<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.450> move<00:02:18.959> and

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
you have to play you have to move and

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.750 
you have to play you have to move and
that's<00:02:19.769> one<00:02:19.920> of<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.040> main<00:02:20.220> reasons<00:02:20.610> why<00:02:20.730> i

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
that's one of the main reasons why i

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.319 
that's one of the main reasons why i
have<00:02:21.030> on<00:02:21.269> ghost<00:02:21.599> even<00:02:22.379> if<00:02:22.500> you<00:02:22.620> guys<00:02:22.799> you<00:02:23.099> know

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:23.329 
have on ghost even if you guys you know

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:26.179 
have on ghost even if you guys you know
maybe<00:02:24.329> even<00:02:24.689> if<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:25.019> got<00:02:25.170> straight<00:02:25.590> back<00:02:25.950> and

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:26.189 
maybe even if you got straight back and

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:29.240 
maybe even if you got straight back and
forth<00:02:26.489> ghost<00:02:27.180> still<00:02:27.659> works<00:02:27.989> so<00:02:28.650> you're<00:02:29.069> able

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
forth ghost still works so you're able

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.729 
forth ghost still works so you're able
to<00:02:29.670> you<00:02:29.909> know<00:02:30.030> you're<00:02:30.359> still<00:02:30.510> able<00:02:30.750> to<00:02:31.200> move

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
to you know you're still able to move

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.440 
to you know you're still able to move
and<00:02:32.099> everything<00:02:32.189> and<00:02:32.549> i'm<00:02:32.640> not<00:02:32.849> entirely<00:02:33.209> sure

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
and everything and i'm not entirely sure

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.929 
and everything and i'm not entirely sure
how<00:02:33.689> my<00:02:33.870> veto<00:02:34.230> actually<00:02:34.590> survived<00:02:34.950> data<00:02:35.700> that

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:35.939 
how my veto actually survived data that

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:38.479 
how my veto actually survived data that
rocket<00:02:36.299> shot<00:02:36.480> there<00:02:36.720> but<00:02:37.040> hey<00:02:38.040> you<00:02:38.099> can<00:02:38.340> see

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
rocket shot there but hey you can see

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.729 
rocket shot there but hey you can see
one<00:02:38.640> of<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.819> main<00:02:39.079> points<00:02:40.079> of<00:02:40.140> this<00:02:40.260> map<00:02:40.500> that

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
one of the main points of this map that

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.009 
one of the main points of this map that
really<00:02:41.040> really<00:02:41.250> can't<00:02:41.430> is<00:02:41.790> reactor<00:02:42.599> room<00:02:42.780> and

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
really really can't is reactor room and

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.479 
really really can't is reactor room and
that's<00:02:43.560> one<00:02:43.709> of<00:02:43.739> the<00:02:43.829> things<00:02:43.980> that<00:02:44.370> I<00:02:44.400> don't

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
that's one of the things that I don't

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.099 
that's one of the things that I don't
like<00:02:44.819> about<00:02:44.879> this<00:02:45.269> map<00:02:45.480> from<00:02:45.599> particular

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
like about this map from particular

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:47.539 
like about this map from particular
people<00:02:46.260> like<00:02:46.590> sitting<00:02:46.980> over<00:02:47.190> there<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:47.459> as

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
people like sitting over there and as

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.399 
people like sitting over there and as
you<00:02:47.700> can<00:02:47.849> see<00:02:47.879> I<00:02:48.030> pick<00:02:48.389> up<00:02:48.540> another<00:02:48.780> 30<00:02:49.079> point

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:49.409 
you can see I pick up another 30 point

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:51.830 
you can see I pick up another 30 point
UAV<00:02:49.829> assists<00:02:50.220> for<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.400> visa<00:02:50.579> and<00:02:51.060> I<00:02:51.329> doubt<00:02:51.569> my

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
UAV assists for the visa and I doubt my

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.229 
UAV assists for the visa and I doubt my
lightning<00:02:52.230> strike<00:02:52.530> so<00:02:53.129> the<00:02:53.670> lightning<00:02:54.000> strike

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
lightning strike so the lightning strike

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.360 
lightning strike so the lightning strike
is<00:02:54.389> a<00:02:54.420> very<00:02:54.690> good<00:02:54.750> killstreak<00:02:55.230> setup<00:02:55.590> and<00:02:55.889> not

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
is a very good killstreak setup and not

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.610 
is a very good killstreak setup and not
the<00:02:56.489> lightning<00:02:56.790> strike<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.269> set<00:02:58.200> up<00:02:58.319> that<00:02:58.500> i'm

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
the lightning strike the set up that i'm

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.020 
the lightning strike the set up that i'm
using<00:02:58.650> right<00:02:59.010> now<00:02:59.189> is<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.670> very<00:02:59.970> good

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
using right now is a very good

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.369 
using right now is a very good
killstreak<00:03:00.569> set<00:03:00.750> up<00:03:00.840> i'm<00:03:00.989> using<00:03:01.290> the

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
killstreak set up i'm using the

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:02.960 
killstreak set up i'm using the
lightning<00:03:01.709> strike<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:01.980> orbital<00:03:02.459> be<00:03:02.549> set<00:03:02.849> and

lightning strike the orbital be set and

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.089 
lightning strike the orbital be set and
the<00:03:03.060> VTOL<00:03:03.389> warship<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:04.109> reason<00:03:04.500> that<00:03:04.530> this<00:03:04.889> is

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
the VTOL warship the reason that this is

here's here again is where I'm talking

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.000 
here's here again is where I'm talking
about<00:04:36.900> how<00:04:37.080> this<00:04:37.260> thing's<00:04:37.500> an<00:04:37.620> absolute

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
about how this thing's an absolute

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.250 
about how this thing's an absolute
monster<00:04:38.250> me<00:04:38.580> and<00:04:38.700> my<00:04:38.790> teammates<00:04:39.270> steamrolled

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260

these<00:04:40.470> kids<00:04:40.800> and<00:04:41.010> the<00:04:41.400> reason<00:04:41.670> for<00:04:41.700> that<00:04:41.820> is

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
these kids and the reason for that is

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.880 
these kids and the reason for that is
because<00:04:42.060> of<00:04:42.360> the<00:04:42.570> orbital<00:04:42.900> vsat<00:04:43.080> so<00:04:43.530> this<00:04:43.710> is

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
because of the orbital vsat so this is

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.100 
because of the orbital vsat so this is
exactly<00:04:44.190> why<00:04:44.490> the<00:04:45.030> orbital<00:04:45.390> be<00:04:45.480> set<00:04:45.750> is<00:04:45.870> key<00:04:46.080> to

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
exactly why the orbital be set is key to

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.320 
exactly why the orbital be set is key to
your<00:04:46.350> success<00:04:46.530> in<00:04:46.980> this<00:04:47.130> game<00:04:47.250> it's<00:04:47.850> also<00:04:48.030> key
