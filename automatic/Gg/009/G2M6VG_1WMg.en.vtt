straight<00:00:51.690> into<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.199> lore<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.680> precursors

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
straight into the lore of the precursors

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.240 
straight into the lore of the precursors
almost<00:00:54.840> nothing<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.680> known<00:00:55.829> about<00:00:55.890> the

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
almost nothing is known about the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.189 
almost nothing is known about the
precursors<00:00:56.820> they<00:00:57.510> held<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.840> mantle<00:00:58.109> of

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
precursors they held the mantle of

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.139 
precursors they held the mantle of
responsibility<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:59.010> one<00:00:59.280> important<00:00:59.879> thing<00:01:00.030> to

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
responsibility is one important thing to

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.410 
responsibility is one important thing to
note<00:01:00.329> what<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.170> mantle<00:01:01.350> well<00:01:02.329> it's<00:01:03.329> not

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
note what is the mantle well it's not

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.990 
note what is the mantle well it's not
actually<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:04.019> mental<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.129> philosophical

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
actually a mental it is a philosophical

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.340 
actually a mental it is a philosophical
belief<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.420> as<00:01:06.600> one<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.049> strongest

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
belief that as one of the strongest

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.730 
belief that as one of the strongest
races<00:01:07.710> they<00:01:07.860> need<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.189> protect<00:01:08.450> everything

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
races they need to protect everything

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.800 
races they need to protect everything
going<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:10.950> far<00:01:11.189> as<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.430> not<00:01:11.850> use<00:01:12.180> lasers<00:01:12.600> or

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
going so far as to not use lasers or

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.600 
going so far as to not use lasers or
anything<00:01:13.140> because<00:01:13.409> they<00:01:13.560> believe<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:14.159> the

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
anything because they believe that the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.240 
anything because they believe that the
universe<00:01:15.030> itself<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.570> alive<00:01:15.890> they<00:01:16.890> instead

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
universe itself is alive they instead

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.249 
universe itself is alive they instead
use<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.490> technology<00:01:17.820> known<00:01:18.270> as<00:01:18.299> neural<00:01:18.869> physics

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
use a technology known as neural physics

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.190 
use a technology known as neural physics
but<00:01:19.549> some<00:01:20.549> kind<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:21.630> voodoo<00:01:21.960> science

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
but some kind of voodoo science

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.160 
but some kind of voodoo science
that<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:22.979> never<00:01:23.220> really<00:01:23.850> explained<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.689> it's

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
that is never really explained so it's

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.289 
that is never really explained so it's
move<00:01:25.470> on<00:01:25.650> they<00:01:26.250> think<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.790> they<00:01:26.939> need<00:01:27.090> to

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
move on they think that they need to

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.020 
move on they think that they need to
protect<00:01:27.869> everyone<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.310> galaxy<00:01:29.460> because

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
protect everyone in the galaxy because

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.480 
protect everyone in the galaxy because
of<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.840> stuff<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.259> just<00:01:31.500> said<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:32.040> they

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
of that stuff I just said and they

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.990 
of that stuff I just said and they
eventually<00:01:32.670> created<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.530> foreigner<00:01:34.530> species

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
eventually created the foreigner species

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.969 
eventually created the foreigner species
apparently<00:01:36.049> which<00:01:37.049> is<00:01:37.229> very<00:01:37.530> important<00:01:37.920> to

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
apparently which is very important to

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.249 
apparently which is very important to
know<00:01:38.689> they<00:01:39.689> later<00:01:40.280> gave<00:01:41.840> the<00:01:42.840> mantle<00:01:43.170> of

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
know they later gave the mantle of

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.080 
know they later gave the mantle of
responsibility<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.220> forerunners<00:01:44.759> so

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
responsibility to the forerunners so

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.630 
responsibility to the forerunners so
that<00:01:45.299> they<00:01:45.450> could<00:01:45.659> take<00:01:45.840> up<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.320> work<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.920> the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
that they could take up the work of the

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.149 
that they could take up the work of the
precursors<00:01:48.270> when<00:01:48.540> they<00:01:48.930> died<00:01:49.170> however<00:01:49.890> that

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
precursors when they died however that

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.999 
precursors when they died however that
isn't<00:01:50.280> really<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.729> whole<00:01:50.880> story<00:01:51.390> the

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
isn't really the whole story the

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.200 
isn't really the whole story the
forerunner<00:01:53.009> were<00:01:53.130> not<00:01:53.310> supposed<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.909> get<00:01:54.060> the

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
forerunner were not supposed to get the

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.520 
forerunner were not supposed to get the
mantle<00:01:54.540> instead<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.020> was<00:01:55.110> supposed<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.350> go<00:01:55.500> to

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
mantle instead it was supposed to go to

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.730 
mantle instead it was supposed to go to
humanity<00:01:56.430> which<00:01:56.790> at<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.270> time<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.899> few<00:01:58.439> million

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
humanity which at the time a few million

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.959 
humanity which at the time a few million
years<00:01:58.770> ago<00:01:59.570> was<00:02:00.570> actually<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:01.290> very<00:02:02.159> powerful

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
years ago was actually a very powerful

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.550 
years ago was actually a very powerful
force<00:02:03.210> in<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.420> galaxy<00:02:03.600> rivaling<00:02:04.439> the

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
force in the galaxy rivaling the

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.399 
force in the galaxy rivaling the
foreigners<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.250> technology<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.719> foreigners

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
foreigners and technology the foreigners

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.430 
foreigners and technology the foreigners
were<00:02:07.860> not<00:02:08.069> as<00:02:08.280> worthy<00:02:08.580> as<00:02:09.050> humanity<00:02:10.050> so<00:02:10.319> the

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
were not as worthy as humanity so the

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.809 
were not as worthy as humanity so the
precursors<00:02:10.890> were<00:02:11.039> going<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.280> give<00:02:11.459> them<00:02:11.670> the

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
precursors were going to give them the

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.490 
precursors were going to give them the
mantle<00:02:12.290> the

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
mantle the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.010 
mantle the
owners<00:02:13.680> didn't<00:02:13.920> like<00:02:14.070> this<00:02:14.280> however<00:02:14.780> so<00:02:15.780> they

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
owners didn't like this however so they

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.560 
owners didn't like this however so they
rose<00:02:16.200> up<00:02:16.410> against<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:16.860> precursors<00:02:17.400> and

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
rose up against the precursors and

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.940 
rose up against the precursors and
killed<00:02:18.570> them<00:02:19.250> yeah<00:02:20.960> precursors<00:02:21.960> however<00:02:22.410> were

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
killed them yeah precursors however were

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.090 
killed them yeah precursors however were
not<00:02:23.490> so<00:02:23.820> easily<00:02:24.030> killed<00:02:24.390> it<00:02:24.630> seemed<00:02:24.900> they<00:02:25.770> left

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
not so easily killed it seemed they left

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.100 
not so easily killed it seemed they left
behind<00:02:26.490> a<00:02:26.900> present

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
behind a present

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.600 
behind a present
those<00:02:28.800> sorts<00:02:29.400> yes<00:02:30.680> to<00:02:31.680> put<00:02:31.890> it<00:02:32.010> simply<00:02:32.370> they

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
those sorts yes to put it simply they

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.920 
those sorts yes to put it simply they
left<00:02:33.300> behind<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.870> special<00:02:34.380> kind<00:02:34.590> of<00:02:34.680> dust<00:02:34.980> and

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
left behind a special kind of dust and

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.660 
left behind a special kind of dust and
this<00:02:36.930> dust<00:02:37.320> in<00:02:37.709> a<00:02:37.800> sense<00:02:38.070> was<00:02:38.459> them<00:02:40.459> they<00:02:41.459> went

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
this dust in a sense was them they went

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.610 
this dust in a sense was them they went
crazy<00:02:42.980> because<00:02:43.980> of<00:02:44.130> their<00:02:44.310> biological<00:02:44.730> need

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
crazy because of their biological need

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:52.190 
crazy because of their biological need
to<00:02:46.620> create<00:02:47.430> life<00:02:48.410> something<00:02:49.459> twisted<00:02:50.959> came<00:02:51.959> to

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
to create life something twisted came to

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.840 
to create life something twisted came to
be<00:02:53.239> so<00:02:54.440> disturbed<00:02:55.440> by<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:55.980> betrayal<00:02:56.550> of<00:02:56.700> the

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
be so disturbed by the betrayal of the

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.030 
be so disturbed by the betrayal of the
foreigner<00:02:57.300> they<00:02:58.230> had<00:02:58.560> a<00:02:58.920> flood<00:02:59.700> of<00:03:00.120> emotions

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
foreigner they had a flood of emotions

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.590 
foreigner they had a flood of emotions
he<00:03:02.040> said<00:03:02.550> it<00:03:02.610> ended<00:03:02.850> their<00:03:03.030> flood<00:03:03.810> yeah<00:03:04.680> well

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
he said it ended their flood yeah well

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.020 
he said it ended their flood yeah well
you<00:03:06.600> guessed<00:03:06.810> it<00:03:07.020> it's<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:07.739> flood<00:03:08.000> they<00:03:09.000> were

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
you guessed it it's the flood they were

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.930 
you guessed it it's the flood they were
the<00:03:09.900> flutter<00:03:10.170> became<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:11.070> flood<00:03:11.310> I<00:03:11.550> guess

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
the flutter became the flood I guess

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.680 
the flutter became the flood I guess
it's<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:12.750> best<00:03:12.810> way<00:03:13.080> to<00:03:13.110> put<00:03:13.380> it<00:03:14.090> so<00:03:15.090> warped

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
it's the best way to put it so warped

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.699 
it's the best way to put it so warped
and<00:03:16.489> corrupted<00:03:17.489> by<00:03:17.519> their<00:03:17.910> time<00:03:18.150> just

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
and corrupted by their time just

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.080 
and corrupted by their time just
existing<00:03:19.709> as<00:03:19.860> this<00:03:20.040> dust<00:03:20.370> eventually<00:03:20.940> they

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
existing as this dust eventually they

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.800 
existing as this dust eventually they
morphed<00:03:21.660> into<00:03:21.959> the<00:03:22.920> flood<00:03:23.130> and<00:03:23.810> actively

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
morphed into the flood and actively

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.100 
morphed into the flood and actively
waged<00:03:25.170> war<00:03:25.500> against<00:03:25.890> everything<00:03:27.110> because

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
waged war against everything because

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.979 
waged war against everything because
they<00:03:28.350> still<00:03:28.799> wanted<00:03:29.250> to<00:03:29.310> create<00:03:30.030> life<00:03:30.330> but<00:03:30.780> now

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
they still wanted to create life but now

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.350 
they still wanted to create life but now
they<00:03:31.170> wanted<00:03:31.500> it<00:03:31.590> to<00:03:31.709> be<00:03:31.830> in<00:03:32.040> that<00:03:32.400> more<00:03:32.820> sick

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
they wanted it to be in that more sick

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.080 
they wanted it to be in that more sick
and<00:03:33.570> twisted<00:03:33.959> image<00:03:34.760> technically<00:03:35.760> this<00:03:35.940> is

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
and twisted image technically this is

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.020 
and twisted image technically this is
where<00:03:36.239> their<00:03:36.420> story<00:03:36.660> ends<00:03:37.140> but<00:03:37.680> you<00:03:38.250> know<00:03:38.370> it's

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
where their story ends but you know it's

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.030 
where their story ends but you know it's
not<00:03:39.180> over<00:03:39.570> just<00:03:40.200> yet<00:03:40.709> because<00:03:41.150> the<00:03:42.150> precursors

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
not over just yet because the precursors

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.729 
not over just yet because the precursors
aren't<00:03:44.040> technically<00:03:45.030> dead<00:03:45.180> I'm<00:03:45.560> going<00:03:46.560> to

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
aren't technically dead I'm going to

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.830 
aren't technically dead I'm going to
probably<00:03:46.950> do<00:03:47.310> an<00:03:47.430> episode<00:03:47.850> on<00:03:47.880> the<00:03:48.120> flood<00:03:48.390> by

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
probably do an episode on the flood by

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.470 
probably do an episode on the flood by
themselves<00:03:49.470> at<00:03:50.040> some<00:03:50.459> point<00:03:50.700> and<00:03:50.940> they<00:03:51.450> are

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
themselves at some point and they are

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.910 
themselves at some point and they are
going<00:03:51.780> to<00:03:51.870> be<00:03:51.989> mentioned<00:03:52.320> in<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:52.530> upcoming

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
going to be mentioned in the upcoming

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.560 
going to be mentioned in the upcoming
episodes<00:03:53.459> that<00:03:53.760> I'm<00:03:53.910> going<00:03:54.120> to<00:03:54.180> be<00:03:54.269> doing<00:03:54.360> of

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
episodes that I'm going to be doing of

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.509 
episodes that I'm going to be doing of
this<00:03:54.750> but<00:03:54.989> technically<00:03:55.769> the<00:03:55.890> precursor<00:03:56.310> story

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
this but technically the precursor story

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.069 
this but technically the precursor story
is<00:03:56.670> over<00:03:56.910> I<00:03:56.940> just<00:03:57.120> have<00:03:57.390> one<00:03:57.570> last<00:03:57.720> thing<00:03:57.930> to

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
is over I just have one last thing to

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.360 
is over I just have one last thing to
say<00:03:58.290> and<00:03:58.530> it<00:03:58.590> has<00:03:58.769> to<00:03:58.890> do<00:03:59.010> with<00:03:59.100> prehistoric

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
say and it has to do with prehistoric

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.690 
say and it has to do with prehistoric
humanity<00:04:00.709> you<00:04:01.709> see<00:04:01.860> prehistoric<00:04:02.400> humans

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
humanity you see prehistoric humans

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.690 
humanity you see prehistoric humans
fought<00:04:03.390> actively<00:04:04.200> against<00:04:04.860> the<00:04:04.980> flood<00:04:05.220> you

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
fought actively against the flood you

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.569 
fought actively against the flood you
know<00:04:05.790> killing<00:04:06.390> everything<00:04:06.780> isn't<00:04:07.079> really

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
know killing everything isn't really

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:11.870 
know killing everything isn't really
something<00:04:08.579> the<00:04:08.670> humans<00:04:09.000> liked<00:04:09.440> so<00:04:10.880> they

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
something the humans liked so they

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.490 
something the humans liked so they
believed<00:04:12.269> they'd<00:04:12.540> eventually<00:04:12.690> found<00:04:13.350> a

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
believed they'd eventually found a

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.530 
believed they'd eventually found a
vaccine<00:04:13.980> of<00:04:14.190> sorts<00:04:14.519> however<00:04:14.880> this<00:04:15.120> simply

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
vaccine of sorts however this simply

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.949 
vaccine of sorts however this simply
isn't<00:04:15.720> true<00:04:15.870> the<00:04:16.530> precursors<00:04:17.130> did<00:04:17.600> still<00:04:18.600> love

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
isn't true the precursors did still love

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.140 
isn't true the precursors did still love
humanity<00:04:19.350> and<00:04:19.859> believed<00:04:20.400> they<00:04:20.729> were<00:04:20.790> worthy

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
humanity and believed they were worthy

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.810 
humanity and believed they were worthy
of<00:04:21.390> the<00:04:21.510> mental<00:04:21.780> responsibility<00:04:22.500> so<00:04:23.250> even

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
of the mental responsibility so even

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.909 
of the mental responsibility so even
though<00:04:23.910> they<00:04:24.030> were<00:04:24.060> crazy<00:04:24.360> they<00:04:24.720> chose<00:04:25.530> to

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
though they were crazy they chose to

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.020 
though they were crazy they chose to
stop<00:04:26.310> infect

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
stop infect

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.320 
stop infect
the<00:04:27.690> prehistoric<00:04:27.990> humans<00:04:28.710> with<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:29.670> flood

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
the prehistoric humans with the flood

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.470 
the prehistoric humans with the flood
virus<00:04:30.870> I<00:04:31.110> guess<00:04:31.350> is<00:04:31.620> what<00:04:31.800> it<00:04:31.890> would<00:04:32.010> be

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
virus I guess is what it would be

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.970 
virus I guess is what it would be
instead<00:04:33.480> opting<00:04:33.810> to<00:04:33.840> kill<00:04:34.650> almost

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
instead opting to kill almost

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.210 
instead opting to kill almost

for<00:04:41.760> humans<00:04:42.090> which<00:04:42.270> we<00:04:42.450> will<00:04:42.600> again<00:04:43.170> touch<00:04:43.410> on
