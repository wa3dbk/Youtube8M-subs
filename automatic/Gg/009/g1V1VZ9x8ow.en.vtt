00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
be spoiled first let's discuss their

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.190 
be spoiled first let's discuss their
actual<00:02:05.939> final<00:02:06.390> match<00:02:06.509> between<00:02:06.689> each<00:02:07.020> bone

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
actual final match between each bone

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.169 
actual final match between each bone
sendou<00:02:07.649> this<00:02:08.099> match<00:02:08.340> was<00:02:08.550> perhaps<00:02:08.940> the

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
sendou this match was perhaps the

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.260 
sendou this match was perhaps the
longest<00:02:09.450> in<00:02:09.959> the

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
longest in the

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.620 
longest in the
it<00:02:10.540> took<00:02:10.780> roughly<00:02:11.110> about<00:02:11.500> four<00:02:12.130> episodes<00:02:12.820> to

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
it took roughly about four episodes to

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.600 
it took roughly about four episodes to
complete<00:02:14.320> it<00:02:14.440> of<00:02:14.740> course<00:02:14.950> that<00:02:15.160> makes<00:02:15.340> sense

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
complete it of course that makes sense

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.130 
complete it of course that makes sense
because<00:02:15.760> it<00:02:16.030> was<00:02:16.120> not<00:02:16.270> only<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.810> series

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
because it was not only the series

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.810 
because it was not only the series
finale<00:02:17.260> but<00:02:17.650> a<00:02:17.770> post<00:02:17.980> quest<00:02:18.280> to<00:02:18.430> get<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:18.580> belt

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
finale but a post quest to get the belt

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.970 
finale but a post quest to get the belt
but<00:02:19.360> as<00:02:19.480> usual<00:02:19.960> the<00:02:19.990> show<00:02:20.320> did<00:02:20.500> an<00:02:20.590> excellent

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
but as usual the show did an excellent

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.340 
but as usual the show did an excellent
job<00:02:21.160> showing<00:02:21.760> both<00:02:22.000> sides<00:02:22.480> of<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.870> fight<00:02:23.110> as

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
job showing both sides of the fight as

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.130 
job showing both sides of the fight as
both<00:02:23.890> men<00:02:24.190> fought<00:02:25.030> for<00:02:25.360> their<00:02:25.480> honor<00:02:25.750> and

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
both men fought for their honor and

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.770 
both men fought for their honor and
their<00:02:26.230> pride<00:02:27.100> as<00:02:27.310> a<00:02:27.340> man<00:02:27.640> while<00:02:28.300> also

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
their pride as a man while also

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:29.970 
their pride as a man while also
entertaining<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.410> masses

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
entertaining the masses

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.920 
entertaining the masses
it<00:02:30.370> was<00:02:30.490> exciting<00:02:30.820> because<00:02:31.150> it<00:02:31.390> covered<00:02:31.690> so

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
it was exciting because it covered so

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.420 
it was exciting because it covered so

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
many different conflicts as the

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.700 
many different conflicts as the
characters<00:02:33.850> took<00:02:34.150> a<00:02:34.180> turn<00:02:34.480> taking<00:02:35.350> the<00:02:35.530> upper

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
thing that made that last fight

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.570 
thing that made that last fight
predictable<00:02:56.470> was<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.770> fact<00:02:57.010> that<00:02:57.070> it<00:02:57.250> was<00:02:57.400> the

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
predictable was the fact that it was the

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:58.380 
predictable was the fact that it was the
end<00:02:57.610> of<00:02:57.850> the<00:02:58.000> series

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.540 
so obviously Ipoh had to win otherwise I
might<00:03:01.690> have<00:03:01.840> thought<00:03:02.380> that<00:03:02.440> sendou<00:03:03.340> could

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.640 
might have thought that sendou could
have<00:03:03.640> taken<00:03:03.880> it<00:03:04.120> I<00:03:04.270> was<00:03:04.690> so<00:03:04.870> invested<00:03:05.500> in
