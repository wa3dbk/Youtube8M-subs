original artwork is almost perfect and
that<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.150> because<00:00:30.710> we<00:00:31.710> got<00:00:31.949> this<00:00:32.160> out<00:00:32.369> of

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
that is because we got this out of

that is because we got this out of
someone's<00:00:32.850> house<00:00:33.180> who<00:00:33.210> got<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.200> when<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.440> was

we've<00:00:43.020> only<00:00:43.200> had<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.559> do<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.710> little<00:00:44.010> bit<00:00:44.250> of

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
we've only had to do a little bit of

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.240 
we've only had to do a little bit of
light<00:00:44.550> touch-up<00:00:45.149> on<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.930> white<00:00:46.140> edges<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:47.100> a

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
light touch-up on the white edges and a

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.580 
light touch-up on the white edges and a
couple<00:00:47.610> spots<00:00:47.879> in<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.239> color<00:00:48.480> but<00:00:48.750> it's<00:00:49.350> just

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
couple spots in the color but it's just

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.470 
couple spots in the color but it's just
beautiful<00:00:50.070> look<00:00:50.579> at<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.760> other<00:00:50.910> side<00:00:51.210> too<00:00:51.420> you

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
beautiful look at the other side too you

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.850 
beautiful look at the other side too you
think<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:52.820> it<00:00:53.820> just<00:00:54.059> came<00:00:54.239> out<00:00:54.510> really<00:00:55.289> nice<00:00:55.620> I

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
think and it just came out really nice I

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.350 
think and it just came out really nice I
just<00:00:56.309> don't<00:00:56.520> think<00:00:56.730> you're<00:00:56.879> gonna<00:00:56.969> find<00:00:57.239> a

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
just don't think you're gonna find a

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.750 
just don't think you're gonna find a
nicer<00:00:57.660> machine<00:00:57.930> we<00:00:58.079> did<00:00:58.320> put<00:00:58.710> yellow<00:00:59.370> tea

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
nicer machine we did put yellow tea

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.000 
nicer machine we did put yellow tea
molding<00:01:00.210> on<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:00.539> originally<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.530> have<00:01:01.739> black

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
molding on this originally I have black

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.680 
molding on this originally I have black
people<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.609> we<00:01:02.670> think<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.969> yellow<00:01:03.090> sets<00:01:03.539> it

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
people and we think the yellow sets it

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.450 
people and we think the yellow sets it
off<00:01:03.809> pretty<00:01:04.019> nice<00:01:04.260> I'll<00:01:04.769> come<00:01:05.070> around<00:01:05.159> back

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
off pretty nice I'll come around back

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.580 
off pretty nice I'll come around back
here<00:01:05.700> Frank<00:01:06.030> I'm<00:01:06.270> gonna<00:01:06.450> show<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.290> what<00:01:07.439> else

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
here Frank I'm gonna show you what else

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.399 
here Frank I'm gonna show you what else
we<00:01:07.680> did<00:01:07.950> we<00:01:08.130> put<00:01:08.430> new<00:01:09.330> capacitors<00:01:10.140> in<00:01:10.320> the

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
we did we put new capacitors in the

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.130 
we did we put new capacitors in the
monitor<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:11.010> new<00:01:11.460> flyback<00:01:12.060> high<00:01:12.330> voltage<00:01:12.780> unit

monitor a new flyback high voltage unit

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.370 
monitor a new flyback high voltage unit
there's<00:01:13.740> also<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.460> new<00:01:14.670> resistor<00:01:15.420> in<00:01:16.229> the

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
there's also a new resistor in the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.010 
there's also a new resistor in the
vertical<00:01:16.770> circuit<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.400> there's<00:01:18.060> also<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.420> curl

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
vertical circuit and there's also a curl

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.469 
vertical circuit and there's also a curl
mod<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.740> we<00:01:19.860> did<00:01:20.100> on<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.759> bottom<00:01:21.150> we<00:01:21.270> have<00:01:21.450> a

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
mod that we did on the bottom we have a

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.469 
mod that we did on the bottom we have a
new<00:01:21.869> filter<00:01:22.380> capacitor<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.790> logic<00:01:24.210> board

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
new filter capacitor so the logic board

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.149 
new filter capacitor so the logic board
of<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.689> power<00:01:24.930> supply<00:01:25.380> gets<00:01:25.740> some<00:01:26.009> nice

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
of the power supply gets some nice

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.670 
of the power supply gets some nice
quality<00:01:26.850> voltage<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.540> here's<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.500> power

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
quality voltage and here's the power

course<00:01:47.670> when<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:47.970> do<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.210> hard<00:01:48.509> there's<00:01:49.020> a

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
course when you do it hard there's a

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.620 
course when you do it hard there's a
slight<00:01:49.470> squeak<00:01:49.920> they<00:01:50.549> always<00:01:50.880> did<00:01:51.119> its<00:01:51.299> people

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
slight squeak they always did its people

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.830 
slight squeak they always did its people

what<00:01:58.150> a<00:01:58.180> great<00:01:58.450> program<00:01:58.659> this<00:01:59.020> was<00:01:59.229> oh<00:01:59.409> here's

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 
what a great program this was oh here's

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:02.280 
what a great program this was oh here's
a<00:01:59.890> little-known<00:02:00.220> fact<00:02:00.399> did<00:02:01.210> you<00:02:01.390> know<00:02:01.570> you<00:02:02.140> can

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
a little-known fact did you know you can

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.490 
a little-known fact did you know you can
only<00:02:02.439> have<00:02:02.829> eight<00:02:03.640> shots<00:02:04.210> on<00:02:04.689> the<00:02:04.930> screen<00:02:05.320> at

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
only have eight shots on the screen at

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.560 
only have eight shots on the screen at
once<00:02:05.740> so<00:02:06.490> in<00:02:06.580> other<00:02:06.640> words<00:02:06.850> if<00:02:07.030> you<00:02:07.119> have<00:02:07.330> eight

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
once so in other words if you have eight

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.270 
once so in other words if you have eight
things<00:02:07.960> until<00:02:08.349> they<00:02:08.500> blow<00:02:08.800> up

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
things until they blow up

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.580 
things until they blow up
you<00:02:09.399> can't<00:02:09.700> fire<00:02:10.030> anything<00:02:10.599> else<00:02:10.780> yes<00:02:11.380> of

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
you can't fire anything else yes of

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.320 
you can't fire anything else yes of
course<00:02:11.830> if<00:02:11.980> you<00:02:12.069> run<00:02:12.310> your<00:02:12.459> cities<00:02:12.819> out<00:02:13.030> that's

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
course if you run your cities out that's

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.540 
course if you run your cities out that's
the<00:02:13.510> end<00:02:13.660> of<00:02:13.780> that<00:02:13.840> but<00:02:14.800> you<00:02:14.920> can<00:02:15.069> only<00:02:15.160> have

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
the end of that but you can only have

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.120 
the end of that but you can only have
eight<00:02:16.269> shots<00:02:16.750> on<00:02:17.019> the<00:02:17.080> screen<00:02:17.410> what<00:02:17.920> did<00:02:18.040> you

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
eight shots on the screen what did you

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.290 
eight shots on the screen what did you
for<00:02:18.310> five<00:02:18.489> six<00:02:18.610> seven<00:02:18.940> eight

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
for five six seven eight

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.080 
for five six seven eight
you<00:02:19.690> can't<00:02:19.959> push<00:02:20.170> them<00:02:20.319> any<00:02:20.500> more<00:02:20.760> until<00:02:21.760> one

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
you can't push them any more until one

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.970 
you can't push them any more until one
explodes<00:02:22.690> that's<00:02:23.110> actually<00:02:23.590> in<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:23.739> program

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
explodes that's actually in the program

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.009 
explodes that's actually in the program
because<00:02:24.730> we<00:02:24.970> actually<00:02:25.120> used<00:02:25.450> to<00:02:25.540> have<00:02:25.660> people

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
because we actually used to have people

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.630 
because we actually used to have people
call<00:02:26.260> it<00:02:26.380> saying<00:02:26.590> we<00:02:26.739> don't<00:02:26.890> know<00:02:27.069> let's<00:02:27.280> run

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
call it saying we don't know let's run

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.000 
call it saying we don't know let's run
it<00:02:28.450> something<00:02:28.900> wrong<00:02:29.050> with<00:02:29.380> the<00:02:29.500> game<00:02:29.709> because

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
it something wrong with the game because

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.210 
it something wrong with the game because
it<00:02:30.190> doesn't<00:02:30.730> think<00:02:30.910> you<00:02:31.090> can<00:02:31.299> hit<00:02:31.510> it<00:02:32.040> yes<00:02:33.040> we

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
it doesn't think you can hit it yes we

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.410 
it doesn't think you can hit it yes we
have<00:02:33.430> those<00:02:33.610> calls<00:02:34.380> something<00:02:35.459> relative<00:02:36.459> we

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
have those calls something relative we

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.690 
have those calls something relative we
didn't<00:02:37.660> know<00:02:37.780> that<00:02:37.810> until<00:02:38.380> we<00:02:38.950> researched

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
didn't know that until we researched

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.120 
didn't know that until we researched
that<00:02:40.090> was<00:02:40.239> years<00:02:40.480> ago<00:02:40.630> but<00:02:41.500> still<00:02:41.799> some<00:02:42.010> people

what<00:03:23.980> the<00:03:24.070> meter<00:03:24.310> has<00:03:24.579> to<00:03:24.820> say<00:03:25.000> sixteen

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
what the meter has to say sixteen

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.610 
what the meter has to say sixteen
thousand<00:03:26.319> plays<00:03:27.090> well<00:03:28.090> that's<00:03:28.390> that's<00:03:29.230> four

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
thousand plays well that's that's four

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.449 
thousand plays well that's that's four
thousand<00:03:30.069> bucks

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
thousand bucks

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.090 
thousand bucks
so<00:03:31.359> the<00:03:31.480> game<00:03:31.630> took<00:03:31.870> in<00:03:32.049> four<00:03:32.290> thousand<00:03:32.859> gross

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
so the game took in four thousand gross

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.259 
so the game took in four thousand gross
the<00:03:34.140> location<00:03:35.140> split<00:03:35.470> the<00:03:35.590> money<00:03:35.709> 50/50<00:03:36.700> that

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
the location split the money 50/50 that

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.420 
the location split the money 50/50 that
means<00:03:37.510> the<00:03:37.720> man<00:03:37.930> paid<00:03:38.410> three<00:03:38.680> thousand<00:03:39.160> for<00:03:39.400> it

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
means the man paid three thousand for it

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.360 
means the man paid three thousand for it
he<00:03:39.970> took<00:03:40.269> in<00:03:40.450> a<00:03:40.480> cool<00:03:40.840> two<00:03:41.230> thousand<00:03:41.889> dollars

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
he took in a cool two thousand dollars

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:50.220 
he took in a cool two thousand dollars
oh<00:03:43.290> he<00:03:44.290> lost<00:03:44.620> money<00:03:45.040> on<00:03:45.190> it<00:03:45.519> oh<00:03:47.579> yes<00:03:48.579> I<00:03:49.230> guess

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
oh he lost money on it oh yes I guess

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.800 
oh he lost money on it oh yes I guess
you<00:03:50.410> didn't<00:03:50.709> know<00:03:50.829> that<00:03:51.040> but<00:03:51.250> 75<00:03:52.120> percent<00:03:52.750> of

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
you didn't know that but 75 percent of

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.280 
you didn't know that but 75 percent of
all<00:03:53.109> these<00:03:53.530> machines<00:03:54.359> never<00:03:55.359> made<00:03:55.989> their

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
all these machines never made their

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.199 
all these machines never made their
costs<00:03:56.799> back<00:03:58.049> that's<00:03:59.049> why<00:03:59.470> the<00:03:59.530> arcades<00:04:00.310> have

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
costs back that's why the arcades have
