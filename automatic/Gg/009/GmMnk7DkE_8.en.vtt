 your friends so your arsenal to you 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.220
 just need a golden set of 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.260
 a few simple trick shots 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.330
 which you can if you like 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.490
 face up and teach your 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:48.040
 friends with you need to remember 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.960
 three rules of biliary showmen first 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.120
 rule try to gather around you 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.470
 as many viewers as possible and follow 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.440
 that all attention was directed 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.880
 just on you the second rule is every hit 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.160
 need to be able to properly present 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.470
 first you must puzzle 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.109
 The viewer's position is wide on the table and only 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.649
 after that surprise them spectacular 

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:08.469
 by decision 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:09.939
 well, the third rule is sure to tell 

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:11.950
 that the strike might not work from the first 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:12.579
 times and you may need several 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.499
 attempts 

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:16.329
 after all, even with the third 

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:18.670
 attempts this happen having 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:21.280
 impression on the audience and so the first 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.619
 the blow we have is a straight story midway 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:28.499
 but the ball clearly prevents us from performing 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.499
 hit well, and that's how it will look back and 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.749
 what really happened now 

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:38.679
 Of course such a blow can not be done in 

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:41.380
 normal game, because first we are on the recipe 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:44.889
 before we push these balls different sides and 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.249
 then the men just hammer the empty ball 

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:47.170
 pockets 

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:49.450
 but since the kick is performed very 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.909
 quickly none of the viewers notice with 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.579
 first try how did you do without 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:57.310
 see how to put the balls we put 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:01.400
 direct alien a7 hand set at an angle 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:05.140
 so that they diverged in this direction 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:08.509
 and we just beat 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:16.910
 period at all in spite of these balls 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:20.330
 Immediately target from another ball now see 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.370
 for the second hit we need to play the ball but 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.140
 while we clearly see that not your not 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.950
 passes no stranger to score also 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.240
 impossible what do we do for 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.890
 performing this blow we are not even 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.260
 it takes a second hand we just 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.740
 We put a ball sticker under this 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.709
 high angle and a little swing 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:42.080
 push the ball forward stickers by the way this 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.709
 hit you can teach a person who 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.750
 before never even held 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.970
 look at the next position with us 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.490
 here it is clearly not crawling its ball 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.020
 we will not be able to cut off another's ball either 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.850
 performing this blow to us again 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:02.090
 will have to combine skills billiards 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:05.600
 basketball look really a gift 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.380
 it turns out due to the fact that we beat the top 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:12.519
 part of the ball 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:15.200
 at a high angle like this we 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.690
 beat the ball from the top down and due to this he 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.239
 already bounces hit by a stranger and 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.650
 flies his universities we will aim 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:26.690
 quite thick much to the right of center 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.950
 we will beat the top down but you can 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.950
 little lead ki left 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.510
 balls for this gift is put practically 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.959
 Of whatever you like, your charm and 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.780
 close board and alien ball was not far 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.790
 from our own ball, let's say under that 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.900
 by the corner 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.650
 the next spectacular blow looks like this 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.130
 way your ball clearly does not creep in 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.080
 puddle 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.150
 and the alien ball is on board and therefore 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:58.390
 beat him too you are not 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:58.840
 hr we'll score like that on this one 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.220
 blow 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:06.400
 we aim the google volume next to 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:10.750
 ball and here we give a good left 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.950
 cog ball twists and falls well and 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.659
 finally the last blow which 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.579
 makes a very strong impression on 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:18.039
 viewers this is french on board 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:21.750
 first we need to explain what is stranger 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:24.490
 it is impossible to score a ball along the side 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.919
 so in this position we will 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.949
 not hammer someone else along the side 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:33.550
 ball see how it is done for 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:37.150
 performing this strike we put our hand on 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.760
 board aiming to someone else's ball is the very center 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.740
 so here we direct kei here too 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.770
 shift to the left screw can be a little bit 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:47.650
 even from the top down to hit and quietly want 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:50.710
 be sure to press a bashir tight 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:53.259
 board and put them not very far 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:59.710
 from each other and without like louis so blow 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:05:01.210
 will make it easier i hope these 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.090
 five blow to pay in order to 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.260
 impress your friends 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.370
 I wish you great holidays and 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.500
