00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.700
 even though there were many 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.880
 opportunities for the best the last 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.460
 step that was to define the very good 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.260
 We did not do it well, but I did not 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.470
 we fell we continue working in each 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.930
 training honing the aim and 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.760
 Now I think it's coming to release with a 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.610
 scored the boys made a great 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.900
 effort I get a goal well enough 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.600
 beautiful 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.100
 it really motivates me and not follow 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.650
 working in the same way we know 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.050
 that the potential is only phase only 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.479
 we need to believe we know what we can do 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.729
 things like this afternoon we decided before 

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:40.559
 rivals that as well as people maybe not 

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:42.479
 he imagined this amount back 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.219
 describes not exactly the goal today is 

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:45.960
 I tried a few minutes before with a 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.120
 ball that the goalkeeper saved and hits the 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.710
 crossbar and not cement with anything and 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.449
 then it returns to that they return it to 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.329
 do and this time and leave to write it 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.249
 I do not think I was in the moment 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.829
 timely a rejection of it 

00:00:56.249 --> 00:01:00.479
 he controlled the ball very well and and 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.489
 when I see I have all the space to 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:03.899
 kicking had already hit the first on the 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.130
 pole then why not kick in 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.289
 again and I get it again not a good shot 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.939
 this time emotional and happy to 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:14.100

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.079

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.709

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:45.569

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.819
 I 'm aware I do not think I 've 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.990
 I have been watching the warmth that the 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:58.140
 people are showing us in each 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.420
 party for us very valuable me in 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.429
 the personal I feel grateful the 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.470
 attitude of the public that is always 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:09.860
 pending even though the team 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:13.190
 it did not raise head that we were in a 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.170
 in a footballing slump they're going to 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.690
 appear costs raise up to 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.480
 day from now but people always believed 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.670
 always I support the team and good think 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.340
 now we all join and we are 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.740
 enjoying a huge joy that is the 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.750
 first triumph at home and especially as 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.450
 I told you before with a great rival and with a 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.650
 huge football team 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.650
 we think so 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.970
 yes I think we should be motivated not to know 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.710
 of what we play go rival things 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.840
 they did not go well 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.540
 we were decisive in the moments 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.520
 keys of the party and that we believe that 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.340
 we have the ability not to believe ourselves 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.200
 more than anyone else but actually anticipate is 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.700
 what we can do and then 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.260
 now we show it and we have to continue in 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.850
 this same way there is to bend the 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.400
 head why believe we won 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.380
 everything has to continue working of the 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.030
 same way with the same intensity and 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.130
 attitude then the results for not 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.970
 to come as well as derby hit him at 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:17.140
 current champion and score a very motivated 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.660
 the truth very happy cheerful 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:23.130
 the truth that I did not expect 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.270
 make a goal of this bill but 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.910
 detects from my dressing room I said my 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.940
 comrades and now I bring a goal you're going to 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:33.820
 see now I bring a goal and then there between 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.730
 laughingly motivating each other me 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.980
 the goal that he had wanted so much 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.650
 do and against a great rival like you what 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.080
 you say so it 's very valuable to me a 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.360
 nice souvenir and was dedicated to the 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.650
 family my husband my children and all my 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.070
 family of savior that is always 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.070
 pending 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.310
 I think he always stressed not that 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.230
 We kept the same attitude that 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.330
 I had liked the effort of all the 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.930
 attitude with which we were playing and 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.130
 just emphasize that things the 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.780
 doing well that we were going to go down 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.060
 the arms and that we continue fighting then 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.470
 in the end we achieve the goal that he 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.850
 I wanted and that as a group we had not 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.000
 raised before the game that was 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.000
 win
