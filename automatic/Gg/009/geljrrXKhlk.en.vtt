00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 Hello everyone, it is considered that HP system 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.220
 almost buggy free and as they say 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.710
 licked to shine of course most 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.990
 readers will agree with this statement 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.420
 however, itâ€™s not quite like that 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.970
 our snow reader march all shared 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.430
 a list of interesting bugs and flaws 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.920
 ls which we will now submit to your 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.869
 the court can not be said that they spoil 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.390
 impression of using the system but 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.500
 learn about them will be quite interesting 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.500
 so we went 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.630
 Let's start with the problems associated with 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.120
 localized ayos transferred to a huge 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.550
 number of languages and need to say that 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.530
 translated well and neatly 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.760
 the truth is not everywhere for example in 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.800
 aiklaud settings 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.010
 if you turn off documents and data 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:57.140
 it becomes completely incomprehensible included 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.140
 whether these same data or not yet 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.890
 Perhaps we will continue with another gods 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.860
 translation let's open the application 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.760
 the camera will put the flash in position 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.770
 turned off 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.350
 and carefully look at the buttons 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.840
 flash and parameters if carefully 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.369
 take a closer look then they run into each 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.680
 friend quite a bit 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.810
 however, enough for this 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.360
 see even with the naked eye 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.000
 I will remind you now it comes to standard 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.130
 Apple applications are not allowed 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.750
 even such seemingly small bloopers 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.869
 now doing the following 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.320
 go to the settings and set the 12-hour 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.450
 time display mode after that 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.000
 you need to open the clock application and 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.920
 set the alarm no matter what time 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.470
 the main thing that appeared in the status bar 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.520
 alarm icon and now the thing 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.890
 interesting 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.500
 open the settings again or turn it on 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.050
 do not disturb mode notice wai icon 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.060
 The statusbar file is completely gone but the phone 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.460
 still remains connected to 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.860
 wireless network turn off mode not 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.259
 bother and supposedly now should 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.420
 wi-fi icon appears again but no 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.240
 You can now return it by blocking and 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.140
 re- unlocked iphone and also not 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.760
 business but we go further 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.220
 let's say your contacts have one 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.560
 man also assume that his number 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.750
 the phone has a cell tag 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.250
 now let's try it 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.590
 call using voice 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.560
 control for this we say call 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.260
 to such to such on cellular here 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.840
 between you and the phone there will be some 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.180
 misunderstandings you tell him call on 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.670
 cell phone instead offers 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.050
 call on some mysterious could this 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.470
 how wrong not to find 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:51.430
 call Kazaki Ilya on 100 causing 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:52.450
 Cossack subscriber I imagine that you 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.160
 sent h2 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.650
 or maybe even more videos by 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.410
 mail in one letter you save them from 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.320
 look at the letters clean and decide 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.180
 forward what needs to be done 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:07.120
 correctly open the photo gallery where 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.400
 and also save and video select those 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.860
 most videos and click send only 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.650
 Here you are, bad luck jumping out from below 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.520
 the menu is completely empty where they should 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.530
 were to be 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.640
 mail icons omez from youtube 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.460
 completely empty 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.040
 but if you choose one video or video + 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:26.020
 photo in this very menu will be 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.180
 everything is okay the tank is manifested only when 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.140
 trying to post more than one video 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.560
 file at a time 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.870
 a mess as you see bugs 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.510
 really almost imperceptible and 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.580
 manifested in quite specific 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.250
 conditions, however, still they are 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.340
 Of course there are bugs everywhere and somewhere 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:48.400
 much more noticeable than with the fact 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.720
 it is not so iyos and bugless 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.820
 as it was commonly believed 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.040
 Now the word is yours dear viewers 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.370
 perhaps you also met some 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.480
 small or not very small errors 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.310
 cupertino vskih programmers 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.070
