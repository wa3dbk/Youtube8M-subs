00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 
here it has almond coconut milk the

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.790 
here it has almond coconut milk the
vanilla<00:06:10.330> when<00:06:10.540> I<00:06:10.600> just<00:06:10.900> showed<00:06:11.170> you<00:06:11.350> the<00:06:11.500> creme

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
vanilla when I just showed you the creme

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.020 
vanilla when I just showed you the creme
brulee<00:06:11.980> in<00:06:12.370> the<00:06:12.490> fresh<00:06:13.740> so<00:06:14.740> just<00:06:15.580> for<00:06:15.820> size

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.030 
brulee in the fresh so just for size

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:17.400 
brulee in the fresh so just for size
comparison<00:06:16.060> this<00:06:16.810> is<00:06:16.870> the<00:06:17.080> one<00:06:17.230> in<00:06:17.380> the

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:17.410 
comparison this is the one in the

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:21.750 
comparison this is the one in the
sampler<00:06:17.980> set<00:06:18.340> and<00:06:18.640> this<00:06:19.330> is<00:06:19.600> the<00:06:20.760> original

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:21.760 
sampler set and this is the original

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.850 
sampler set and this is the original
size<00:06:22.270> so<00:06:22.630> you<00:06:22.720> can<00:06:22.960> compare<00:06:23.410> the<00:06:23.890> difference

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 
size so you can compare the difference

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.790 
size so you can compare the difference
so<00:06:26.860> there's<00:06:27.040> four<00:06:27.340> of<00:06:27.370> these<00:06:27.580> in<00:06:27.790> here<00:06:28.800> see

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:29.800 
so there's four of these in here see

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.690 
so there's four of these in here see
this<00:06:30.130> was<00:06:30.630> $60<00:06:31.630> and<00:06:31.930> this<00:06:32.110> one<00:06:32.260> is<00:06:32.410> 50<00:06:32.890> so<00:06:33.580> this

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:33.700 
this was $60 and this one is 50 so this

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.230 
this was $60 and this one is 50 so this
one<00:06:33.910> is<00:06:34.060> a<00:06:34.090> nice<00:06:34.600> set<00:06:35.380> per<00:06:35.830> in<00:06:36.610> terms<00:06:37.000> of<00:06:37.120> the

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.240 
one is a nice set per in terms of the

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.090 
one is a nice set per in terms of the
value<00:06:37.630> but<00:06:37.870> I<00:06:37.930> just<00:06:38.170> wanted<00:06:38.440> to<00:06:38.560> have<00:06:38.710> a<00:06:38.740> big
