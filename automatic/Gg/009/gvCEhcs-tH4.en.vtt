00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
going to go in and just create this S

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.300 
going to go in and just create this S
shape<00:01:20.840> then<00:01:21.840> I'm<00:01:21.930> gonna<00:01:22.020> take<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.560> iron<00:01:22.830> and

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
shape then I'm gonna take the iron and

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.870 
shape then I'm gonna take the iron and
place<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.970> in<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.869> just<00:01:25.619> go<00:01:25.799> down<00:01:26.100> my<00:01:26.430> little<00:01:26.700> S

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
place it in and just go down my little S

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.600 
place it in and just go down my little S
pattern<00:01:27.240> here<00:01:30.380> so<00:01:31.380> I'm<00:01:31.439> keeping<00:01:31.710> one<00:01:32.280> hand

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
pattern here so I'm keeping one hand

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.450 
pattern here so I'm keeping one hand
holding<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.240> shape<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:34.820> then<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.880> iron<00:01:36.240> is

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
holding the shape and then the iron is

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.160 
holding the shape and then the iron is
really<00:01:38.460> pushing<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.150> shape<00:01:39.509> in<00:01:39.780> with<00:01:40.020> the

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
really pushing that shape in with the

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.420 
really pushing that shape in with the
heat

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.130 

so<00:01:45.430> I'm<00:01:45.520> just<00:01:45.670> using<00:01:45.939> one<00:01:46.119> hand<00:01:46.330> to<00:01:46.869> push<00:01:47.110> the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
so I'm just using one hand to push the

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.140 
so I'm just using one hand to push the
bottom<00:01:47.740> of<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:48.040> ass<00:01:48.189> in<00:01:48.580> and<00:01:49.090> hold<00:01:49.390> it<00:01:51.150> and

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
bottom of the ass in and hold it and

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:58.530 
bottom of the ass in and hold it and
then<00:01:52.210> the<00:01:52.659> iron<00:01:52.930> is<00:01:53.320> coming<00:01:53.710> in<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.939> creating

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
then the iron is coming in and creating

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.930 
then the iron is coming in and creating
that<00:01:58.659> shape<00:01:59.049> and<00:01:59.290> really<00:01:59.590> pushing<00:02:00.399> it<00:02:00.490> in<00:02:00.729> and

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
that shape and really pushing it in and

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.910 
that shape and really pushing it in and
holding<00:02:01.270> it

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.540 

so<00:02:06.460> once<00:02:06.670> I'm<00:02:06.850> done<00:02:07.030> with<00:02:07.090> that<00:02:08.340> I'm<00:02:09.340> going<00:02:09.460> to

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
so once I'm done with that I'm going to

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.480 
so once I'm done with that I'm going to
take<00:02:09.880> a<00:02:11.250> few<00:02:12.250> clips<00:02:12.670> and<00:02:12.970> just<00:02:13.180> clip<00:02:13.569> that<00:02:14.490> into

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
take a few clips and just clip that into

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.370 
take a few clips and just clip that into
play<00:02:18.030> okay<00:02:19.030> so<00:02:19.090> now<00:02:19.420> I've<00:02:19.569> created<00:02:19.750> my<00:02:20.140> first

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
play okay so now I've created my first

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.530 
play okay so now I've created my first
one<00:02:20.740> and<00:02:21.550> I'm<00:02:21.610> just<00:02:21.670> going<00:02:21.880> to<00:02:21.940> keep<00:02:22.209> moving

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
one and I'm just going to keep moving

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.940 
one and I'm just going to keep moving
around<00:02:23.080> taking<00:02:23.440> vertical<00:02:24.100> partings<00:02:25.950> getting

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
around taking vertical partings getting

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.000 
around taking vertical partings getting
a<00:02:27.040> section<00:02:27.459> that<00:02:27.640> I<00:02:27.730> can<00:02:27.940> comfortably<00:02:28.420> work<00:02:28.690> in

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
a section that I can comfortably work in

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.440 
a section that I can comfortably work in
again<00:02:30.010> I'm<00:02:30.160> going<00:02:30.250> to<00:02:30.310> take<00:02:30.610> a<00:02:30.640> little<00:02:31.000> clip

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
again I'm going to take a little clip

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.199 
again I'm going to take a little clip
here<00:02:31.950> place<00:02:32.950> that<00:02:33.250> in<00:02:33.400> a<00:02:33.520> line<00:02:33.730> so<00:02:34.000> I'm<00:02:34.060> going

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
here place that in a line so I'm going

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.290 
here place that in a line so I'm going
to<00:02:34.270> slightly<00:02:34.660> start<00:02:35.110> moving<00:02:35.530> down<00:02:36.060> around<00:02:37.060> her

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
to slightly start moving down around her

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.470 
to slightly start moving down around her
head<00:02:37.510> this<00:02:37.720> way<00:02:37.959> so<00:02:38.950> at<00:02:39.430> this<00:02:39.580> point<00:02:39.910> I<00:02:40.239> have

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
head this way so at this point I have

out so you can see how it just gives it

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.250 
out so you can see how it just gives it
a<00:03:20.079> really<00:03:20.110> pretty<00:03:20.650> soft<00:03:21.070> wave<00:03:21.750> it<00:03:22.750> looks<00:03:22.930> very

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
a really pretty soft wave it looks very

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.949 
a really pretty soft wave it looks very
reminiscent<00:03:23.769> of<00:03:24.160> like<00:03:24.670> the<00:03:24.880> 40s<00:03:25.360> but<00:03:25.660> still

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
reminiscent of like the 40s but still

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.220 
reminiscent of like the 40s but still
very<00:03:26.170> modern<00:03:26.410> day<00:03:27.510> and<00:03:28.510> I<00:03:28.630> think<00:03:28.870> the<00:03:29.019> way<00:03:29.200> that

very modern day and I think the way that

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.110 
very modern day and I think the way that
we<00:03:29.560> went<00:03:29.709> about<00:03:29.829> it<00:03:30.190> is<00:03:30.340> what<00:03:30.519> makes<00:03:30.670> it<00:03:30.910> so

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
we went about it is what makes it so

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.740
