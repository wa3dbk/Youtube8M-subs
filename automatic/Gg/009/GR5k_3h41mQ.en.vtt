00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
guys how to draw Einstein um I have a

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.280 
guys how to draw Einstein um I have a
picture<00:00:08.730> here<00:00:08.760> but<00:00:09.150> I<00:00:09.210> just<00:00:09.510> want<00:00:09.719> to<00:00:09.780> make

because i just wanted to try it out
again<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:30.300> draw<00:00:30.720> Einstein<00:00:31.199> here<00:00:31.529> so<00:00:32.360> this<00:00:33.360> is

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
again I draw Einstein here so this is

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.620 
again I draw Einstein here so this is
gonna<00:00:33.660> be<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:34.200> composition<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.489> Einstein<00:00:36.090> so

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
gonna be a composition of Einstein so

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.740 
gonna be a composition of Einstein so
I'll<00:00:36.780> just<00:00:36.960> write<00:00:37.170> down<00:00:37.380> his<00:00:37.530> name<00:00:37.770> up<00:00:38.010> here

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
I'll just write down his name up here

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:45.430 
I'll just write down his name up here
I'm<00:00:40.579> Stein<00:00:42.260> okay

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.310

wrote<00:01:19.409> Einstein<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:20.820> I'm<00:01:20.939> gonna<00:01:21.060> get<00:01:21.299> my

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
wrote Einstein so I'm gonna get my

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:29.810 
wrote Einstein so I'm gonna get my
yellow<00:01:22.189> pink<00:01:23.869> eraser<00:01:24.869> there<00:01:25.880> and<00:01:26.880> just<00:01:28.820> erase

just going to write that over here

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:47.210 
just going to write that over here
Einstein<00:01:38.479> and<00:01:39.479> then<00:01:45.590> you<00:01:46.590> got<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.799> little<00:01:47.070> bit

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
Einstein and then you got a little bit

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.670 
Einstein and then you got a little bit
of<00:01:47.310> these<00:01:47.430> weird-looking<00:01:48.229> curly<00:01:49.229> hairs<00:01:49.439> on
