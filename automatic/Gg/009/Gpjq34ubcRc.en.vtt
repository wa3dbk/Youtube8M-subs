the 5970 okay welcome back
just<00:00:36.210> unpackage<00:00:36.690> them<00:00:36.750> we<00:00:36.989> didn't<00:00:37.170> need<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.320> go

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
just unpackage them we didn't need to go

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.860 
just unpackage them we didn't need to go
through<00:00:38.100> opening<00:00:38.430> them<00:00:38.520> one<00:00:38.670> by<00:00:38.820> one<00:00:41.870> we'll

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
through opening them one by one we'll

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.240 
through opening them one by one we'll
just<00:00:42.899> see<00:00:43.200> what<00:00:43.410> it's<00:00:43.590> like<00:00:45.800> buying<00:00:46.800> three<00:00:47.130> of

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
just see what it's like buying three of

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.300 
just see what it's like buying three of
these<00:00:47.370> becomes<00:00:47.940> pretty<00:00:48.210> silly<00:00:48.480> now<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.720> think

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:49.310 
these becomes pretty silly now I think

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.590 
these becomes pretty silly now I think
anything<00:00:50.310> after<00:00:50.610> two<00:00:50.790> becomes<00:00:51.210> just<00:00:51.390> more

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
anything after two becomes just more

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.710 
anything after two becomes just more
bragging<00:00:52.050> rights<00:00:55.970> really<00:00:56.970> there<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.180> no<00:00:57.420> point

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:57.720 
bragging rights really there is no point

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:58.430 
bragging rights really there is no point

whatsoever
only<00:00:58.920> more<00:00:59.100> than<00:00:59.130> two<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.490> these<00:00:59.640> cards<00:01:00.000> I

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.530

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.670 
price alone Quad SLI quite a saw light
actually<00:01:14.340> was<00:01:15.329> worse<00:01:15.570> in<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.869> lot<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.110> games<00:01:16.320> so

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
actually was worse in a lot of games so

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.359 
actually was worse in a lot of games so
you<00:01:17.460> actually<00:01:17.850> lost<00:01:18.060> performance<00:01:19.369> obviously

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
you actually lost performance obviously

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.059 
you actually lost performance obviously
this<00:01:20.759> funnel<00:01:20.969> is<00:01:21.119> already<00:01:21.359> open<00:01:21.859> but<00:01:22.859> I<00:01:22.920> just

00:01:23.059 --> 00:01:23.069 
this funnel is already open but I just

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:27.559 
this funnel is already open but I just
wanted<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:25.399> get<00:01:26.399> the<00:01:26.549> feel<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.789> opening<00:01:27.210> three

00:01:27.559 --> 00:01:27.569 
wanted to get the feel of opening three

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:34.219 
wanted to get the feel of opening three
yeah<00:01:30.740> so<00:01:31.740> just<00:01:32.009> quickly<00:01:32.689> I'm<00:01:33.689> going<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.929> park

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
yeah so just quickly I'm going to park

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.249 
yeah so just quickly I'm going to park
them<00:01:34.409> side<00:01:34.649> by<00:01:34.679> side<00:01:35.389> for<00:01:36.389> a<00:01:36.450> photo<00:01:36.719> shoot<00:01:36.840> I

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
them side by side for a photo shoot I

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.070 
them side by side for a photo shoot I
always<00:01:37.619> love<00:01:37.799> photo<00:01:38.009> shoots

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
with my Canon 5d Mark - so there's going

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.470 
with my Canon 5d Mark - so there's going
to<00:01:48.510> be<00:01:48.600> some<00:01:48.810> beautiful<00:01:49.370> Pyrus<00:01:50.370> photos<00:01:51.330> of

to be some beautiful Pyrus photos of

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.370 
to be some beautiful Pyrus photos of
these<00:01:53.510> I'm<00:01:54.510> going<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.690> do<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.810> short<00:01:55.020> intro

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
these I'm going to do a short intro

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:17.660 

last<00:02:09.960> card<00:02:13.790> finally<00:02:16.250> but<00:02:17.250> all<00:02:17.370> I<00:02:17.400> wouldn't

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
last card finally but all I wouldn't

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.060 
last card finally but all I wouldn't
decided<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.180> go<00:02:18.300> through<00:02:18.540> this<00:02:18.720> time<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.890> last

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
decided to go through this time the last

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.580 
decided to go through this time the last
time<00:02:20.220> I<00:02:20.310> did<00:02:20.460> try<00:02:20.700> so<00:02:20.760> I<00:02:20.940> was<00:02:21.300> Oh<00:02:23.900> GTX<00:02:24.900> 280s<00:02:25.350> yeah

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
time I did try so I was Oh GTX 280s yeah

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.880 
time I did try so I was Oh GTX 280s yeah
GTX<00:02:26.190> 280s<00:02:26.640> was<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:26.970> last<00:02:27.150> time<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:28.350> after

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
GTX 280s was the last time and after

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.400 
GTX 280s was the last time and after
that<00:02:28.980> I<00:02:29.040> sort<00:02:29.310> of<00:02:29.630> got<00:02:30.630> a<00:02:30.690> bit<00:02:30.840> tired<00:02:31.080> of<00:02:31.230> it

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
that I sort of got a bit tired of it

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.140 
that I sort of got a bit tired of it
just<00:02:31.740> the<00:02:31.950> headaches<00:02:32.310> of<00:02:32.490> micro<00:02:32.910> stuttering

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
just the headaches of micro stuttering

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.710 
just the headaches of micro stuttering
and<00:02:33.540> driver<00:02:33.780> problems<00:02:34.350> and<00:02:34.560> game<00:02:34.710> problems

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
and driver problems and game problems

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.810 
and driver problems and game problems
but<00:02:36.720> this<00:02:36.900> did<00:02:37.290> get<00:02:37.470> good<00:02:37.770> reviews<00:02:38.010> regarding

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
but this did get good reviews regarding

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.270 
but this did get good reviews regarding
scaling<00:02:39.630> so<00:02:39.870> one<00:02:40.110> to<00:02:40.320> two<00:02:40.500> is<00:02:40.560> very<00:02:40.800> good

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
scaling so one to two is very good

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.520 
scaling so one to two is very good
obviously<00:02:41.850> nearly<00:02:42.240> 90<00:02:42.840> percent<00:02:42.870> or<00:02:43.260> something

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
obviously nearly 90 percent or something

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.620 
obviously nearly 90 percent or something
like<00:02:43.650> that<00:02:43.710> scaling<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:44.550> 2<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.180> 3<00:02:45.390> still

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
like that scaling and 2 to 3 still

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.860 
like that scaling and 2 to 3 still
pretty<00:02:45.840> good<00:02:47.000> we're<00:02:48.000> going<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.180> go<00:02:48.300> ahead<00:02:48.450> and

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
pretty good we're going to go ahead and

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.970 
pretty good we're going to go ahead and
do<00:02:49.800> a<00:02:49.830> SLI<00:02:50.550> run<00:02:51.170> with<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.290> same<00:02:52.440> benchmarks

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
do a SLI run with the same benchmarks

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.970 
do a SLI run with the same benchmarks
that<00:02:53.070> I<00:02:53.100> run<00:02:53.280> with<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.610> single<00:02:54.180> GTX<00:02:54.900> 280<00:02:55.170> so

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
that I run with the single GTX 280 so

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.229 
that I run with the single GTX 280 so
