00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
cranking will move and but when this

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.410 
cranking will move and but when this
part<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:39.869> straight<00:01:40.460> this<00:01:41.460> serum<00:01:41.880> will<00:01:42.000> spend

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
part is straight this serum will spend

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.450 
part is straight this serum will spend
because<00:01:42.689> when<00:01:43.020> loud<00:01:43.290> welder<00:01:43.740> he<00:01:43.920> welded<00:01:44.310> like

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
because when loud welder he welded like

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.190 
because when loud welder he welded like

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
at an angle and I'm not mad at emerging

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.190 
at an angle and I'm not mad at emerging
but<00:01:49.380> uh<00:01:50.340> it's<00:01:51.149> not<00:01:51.299> really<00:01:51.570> his<00:01:51.780> fault<00:01:51.960> because

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
clip that off there and then hook a hook

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.789 
clip that off there and then hook a hook
my<00:02:00.119> own<00:02:00.240> steering<00:02:00.659> wheel<00:02:00.810> on<00:02:00.960> there<00:02:01.290> I'm<00:02:02.750> I<00:02:03.799> get

my own steering wheel on there I'm I get
a<00:02:04.829> proper<00:02:05.159> steering<00:02:05.399> just<00:02:05.729> hook<00:02:05.939> it<00:02:05.969> on<00:02:06.180> there

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.889 
a proper steering just hook it on there
and<00:02:06.600> that<00:02:07.020> might<00:02:07.229> sort<00:02:07.439> it<00:02:07.590> out<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:08.899> yeah

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
and that might sort it out and yeah

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.809 
and that might sort it out and yeah
obviously<00:02:10.140> these<00:02:10.709> wheels<00:02:10.979> on<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.310> back<00:02:11.459> and

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
obviously these wheels on the back and

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.800 
obviously these wheels on the back and
actually<00:02:12.209> on

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
actually on

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.050 
actually on
properly<00:02:14.230> and<00:02:15.130> you're<00:02:15.520> not<00:02:15.640> gonna<00:02:15.850> be<00:02:15.940> like

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
properly and you're not gonna be like

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.290 
properly and you're not gonna be like
that<00:02:16.120> poor<00:02:16.840> yeah<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:18.370> I<00:02:18.490> might<00:02:18.640> put<00:02:18.790> a<00:02:18.850> bar<00:02:19.090> at

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
that poor yeah and I might put a bar at

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.390 
that poor yeah and I might put a bar at
the<00:02:19.390> back<00:02:19.540> of<00:02:19.569> the<00:02:19.750> seat<00:02:19.990> it<00:02:20.319> might<00:02:20.560> give<00:02:21.250> it<00:02:21.370> a

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
the back of the seat it might give it a

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.330 
the back of the seat it might give it a
bit<00:02:21.550> more<00:02:21.580> sport<00:02:22.060> but<00:02:22.240> then<00:02:22.360> I<00:02:22.480> don't<00:02:22.540> know<00:02:22.840> and
