the gaming headset I'm not sure how it
sounds<00:04:57.310> like<00:04:57.460> I<00:04:57.670> think<00:04:57.970> of<00:04:58.180> course<00:04:58.480> of<00:04:58.720> course

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.230 
sounds like I think of course of course

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.050 
sounds like I think of course of course
it's<00:04:59.470> not<00:04:59.650> as<00:04:59.830> good<00:05:00.070> as<00:05:00.310> my<00:05:00.550> blue<00:05:00.820> Yeti

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060

over<00:05:04.000> with<00:05:04.290> but<00:05:05.290> I<00:05:05.470> think<00:05:06.070> it<00:05:06.280> sounds<00:05:06.460> pretty

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640 
over with but I think it sounds pretty

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.060 
over with but I think it sounds pretty
good<00:05:06.850> for<00:05:07.330> a<00:05:07.360> headset<00:05:07.870> so<00:05:08.110> this<00:05:08.620> is<00:05:08.800> what<00:05:08.950> it

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
good for a headset so this is what it

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.920 
good for a headset so this is what it
sounds<00:05:09.310> like<00:05:09.370> to<00:05:09.730> other<00:05:09.970> people<00:05:10.390> listening<00:05:10.750> to

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:10.950 
to say that the Dolby surround sound

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.130
