00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
team and I would love to see a super

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.330 
team and I would love to see a super
bowl<00:00:17.340> like<00:00:17.520> that<00:00:17.550> with<00:00:18.830> defenses<00:00:19.830> really

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
bowl like that with defenses really

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.240 
bowl like that with defenses really
going<00:00:20.520> at<00:00:20.699> it<00:00:20.930> but<00:00:21.930> this<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.080> going<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.380> be<00:00:22.560> my

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
going at it but this is going to be my

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.040 
going at it but this is going to be my
realistic<00:00:25.160> prediction<00:00:26.449> and<00:00:27.449> not<00:00:27.630> saying<00:00:27.900> that

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
realistic prediction and not saying that

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.540 
realistic prediction and not saying that
the<00:00:28.140> base<00:00:28.289> can't<00:00:28.710> go<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.039> Super<00:00:29.189> Bowl<00:00:29.279> I

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
the base can't go to the Super Bowl I

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.710 
the base can't go to the Super Bowl I
just<00:00:29.789> think<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.150> it's<00:00:30.390> going<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.539> be<00:00:30.689> a

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
just think that it's going to be a

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.510 
just think that it's going to be a
couple<00:00:30.960> more<00:00:31.199> years<00:00:31.410> until<00:00:31.769> they<00:00:32.219> go<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.399> the

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
couple more years until they go to the

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.389 
couple more years until they go to the
Super<00:00:32.820> Bowl<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.440> I'm<00:00:34.440> still<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.130> know<00:00:35.160> I'm

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
Super Bowl and I'm still you know I'm

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.560 
Super Bowl and I'm still you know I'm
still<00:00:35.579> going<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.760> be<00:00:35.850> rooting<00:00:36.180> for<00:00:36.210> him<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.480> go

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
still going to be rooting for him to go

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.549 
still going to be rooting for him to go
to<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.750> Super<00:00:36.870> Bowl<00:00:37.020> it's<00:00:37.230> just<00:00:37.380> I<00:00:37.500> don't

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
to the Super Bowl it's just I don't

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.340 
to the Super Bowl it's just I don't
think<00:00:38.420> they'll<00:00:39.420> really<00:00:39.570> go<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.110> Super

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
think they'll really go to the Super

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.090 
think they'll really go to the Super
Bowl<00:00:40.379> next<00:00:40.500> year<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.390> yeah<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.320> got<00:00:43.920> the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
Bowl next year and yeah so I got the

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.279 
Bowl next year and yeah so I got the
Patriots<00:00:44.579> going<00:00:45.059> in<00:00:45.149> from<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.450> AFC<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.200> know

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
Patriots going in from the AFC you know

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.680 
Patriots going in from the AFC you know
this<00:00:46.500> team<00:00:46.739> just<00:00:46.980> looks<00:00:47.160> way<00:00:47.430> too<00:00:47.460> good<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.539> not

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
this team just looks way too good to not

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.330 
this team just looks way too good to not
go<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:48.960> another<00:00:49.289> Super<00:00:49.590> Bowl<00:00:49.770> they<00:00:49.920> went<00:00:50.129> last

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
go to another Super Bowl they went last

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.380 
go to another Super Bowl they went last
year<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.879> they<00:00:50.969> lost<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.199> giants<00:00:53.360> but<00:00:54.360> I

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
year and they lost to the giants but I

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.580 
year and they lost to the giants but I
think<00:00:54.690> they're<00:00:54.809> going<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:54.960> be<00:00:55.140> back<00:00:55.379> again

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
think they're going to be back again

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.350 
think they're going to be back again
next<00:00:55.770> year<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.430> they're<00:00:56.579> gonna<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.090> they're

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
next year and they're gonna and they're

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.760 
next year and they're gonna and they're
going<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.510> do<00:00:57.629> really<00:00:57.809> well<00:00:57.960> not<00:00:58.379> on<00:00:58.590> the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.200 
postseason in the postseason obviously
going<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.420> take<00:01:09.570> on<00:01:09.750> much<00:01:10.020> hotter<00:01:10.290> teams<00:01:11.210> and

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
the only team that I really think that

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.140 
the only team that I really think that
can<00:01:13.830> top<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.040> can<00:01:14.460> stop<00:01:14.640> them<00:01:14.880> all<00:01:15.060> the

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
can top that can stop them all the

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.880 
can top that can stop them all the
steelers<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.840> maybe<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.350> broncos<00:01:16.890> not<00:01:17.400> sure

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
steelers and maybe the broncos not sure

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.600 
steelers and maybe the broncos not sure
so<00:01:19.890> yeah<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.400> now<00:01:20.869> to<00:01:21.869> go<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.320> NFC<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:23.310> hate

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
so yeah and now to go to the NFC I hate

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.190 
so yeah and now to go to the NFC I hate
doing<00:01:23.759> this<00:01:24.090> but<00:01:24.390> it's<00:01:24.659> going<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.869> be<00:01:25.080> the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
doing this but it's going to be the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.149 
doing this but it's going to be the
package<00:01:26.900> quite<00:01:27.900> honestly<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.439> hope<00:01:28.710> they<00:01:28.950> don't

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
package quite honestly I hope they don't

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.789 
package quite honestly I hope they don't
go<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.549> Super<00:01:29.790> Bowl<00:01:30.200> because<00:01:31.200> I'm<00:01:31.470> best

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
go to the Super Bowl because I'm best

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.830 
go to the Super Bowl because I'm best
fan<00:01:32.070> but<00:01:32.549> I'm<00:01:32.640> being<00:01:32.820> realistic<00:01:33.180> here<00:01:33.570> it

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
fan but I'm being realistic here it

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.600 
fan but I'm being realistic here it
looks<00:01:34.110> like<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.439> could<00:01:34.650> be<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.829> Packers<00:01:35.340> going

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
looks like it could be the Packers going

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.179 
looks like it could be the Packers going
to<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.820> Super<00:01:36.119> Bowl<00:01:36.560> Aaron<00:01:37.560> Rodgers<00:01:37.979> last

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
to the Super Bowl Aaron Rodgers last

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.140 
to the Super Bowl Aaron Rodgers last
year's<00:01:38.430> MVP<00:01:38.960> I'm<00:01:39.960> looking<00:01:40.140> very<00:01:40.500> good<00:01:40.850> it<00:01:41.850> not

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
year's MVP I'm looking very good it not

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.700 
year's MVP I'm looking very good it not
the<00:01:42.329> only<00:01:42.479> way<00:01:42.689> this<00:01:42.840> team<00:01:43.110> won't<00:01:43.290> do<00:01:43.500> anything

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
the only way this team won't do anything

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.550 
the only way this team won't do anything
in<00:01:44.340> my<00:01:44.579> opinion<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.210> if<00:01:45.420> Aaron<00:01:46.020> Rodgers<00:01:46.380> get

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
in my opinion is if Aaron Rodgers get

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.499 
in my opinion is if Aaron Rodgers get
hurt<00:01:46.770> if<00:01:47.220> Aaron<00:01:47.490> Rodgers<00:01:47.820> is<00:01:47.939> hurt<00:01:48.119> this<00:01:48.299> team

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
hurt if Aaron Rodgers is hurt this team

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.679
