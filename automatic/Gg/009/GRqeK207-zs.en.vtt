00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.640
 speak personal but a good tone in the kitchen 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.550
 starting here Luis and today we are going 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.389
 to teach not one more three recipes to 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.950
 you 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.440
 the first is simply a pâté 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.379
 delicious black olives 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.350
 the second is a very gorgonzola pate 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.230
 easy to make and until the recipe is 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.420
 an absolutely easy to 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.439
 delicious for you to enjoy with the 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.449
 your roles 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.439
 Let's start with the pâté 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.090
 olives 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.969
 here we will need a 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.170
 processor then just put the house 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.550
 so we black 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.840
 here we are using that 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:43.559
 and cut in half 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.410
 now you add clients and finally 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.170
 a good amount of olive oil 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.149
 now only process these ingredients 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.610
 making sure that from time to time you 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.340
 wipe the sides as a spatula to 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.800
 enjoy all the ingredients and your 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.980
 Olives pate ready, that's it. 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.820
 consistency you want now only 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.379
 Reserve 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.799
 so let's now go to the 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.470
 gorgonzola here you will need a 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.229
 piece of gorgonzola and incredible that 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.030
 seems or will only need olive oil 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.729
 olive and a fork 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.100
 just put the olive oil going forward with 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.950
 fork until it reaches the consistency 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.659
 desired and is very easy even 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.240
 But we decided to teach here because 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.549
 We had several recipes asking for 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.130
 to put in the processor add 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.290
 add cream cheese and the 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.659
 Do not you think you need all this? 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.110
 beating gorgonzola is yummy so 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.540
 even just with cheese and some olive oil 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.329
 then just adding olive oil gradually 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.500
 and kneading until you reach the point you 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.720
 want to 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.909
 now just book and at last we 'll go 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.560
 teach to make the toasts that also 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.990
 they are very easy 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.659
 on a board or you will only need it 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.939
 from that bridge po tosth island you 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.219
 finds Brazilian brands not even 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.270
 needs to be imported and is easy to 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.909
 meet 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.330
 just cut into strips just like you 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.630
 You see, you put the two strips together. 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.150
 the edge 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.650
 it's easier to cut then you join 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.040
 the middle strips 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:26.560
 then you will cut into triangles and 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:29.050
 diamonds just as you are seeing if 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.760
 you want you can even do more 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.650
 of a tortilla at a time 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.650
 so the process gets even faster 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.000
 now it's just spreading everything very well for 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.970
 a form need not be and have 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.490
 sure you do not have one on top of the other 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.310
 just add olive sites on top and 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.090
 a little sea salt those ground 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.950
 just in time 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.320
 if you do not have sea salt it can be 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.810
 with common salt, just take care to 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.510
 not add much here is just to give a 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.900
 I like very light take the oven for some 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.690
 220 degrees until golden brown or 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.940
 less than five or ten minutes 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.010
 keep an eye out you do not have to leave too much 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.320
 it's just until it's crispy 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.600
 the papers are ready for toast 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.760
 it is ready and all this is 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.610
 very good the toast is super 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.700
 crunchy cake looks like pastry dough 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.800
 and the pates are delicious for the feather 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.410
 do at home and check I guarantee 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.360
