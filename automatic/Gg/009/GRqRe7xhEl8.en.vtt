00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:05.120
 cpu mobile like other manufacturers 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.450
 2 Calbee arrival 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.270
 I would like to easily define 2100 pt self-defense 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.899
 The price was 8000th after the main race of yet Rakuten 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:18.619
 It was samurai 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.940
 I am in the middle of the 3rd 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.940
 Do you use for 3 days to 11 days 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.019
 kiss 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:31.759
 Eh iphone 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.250
 A bluetooth keyboard used &amp; used with you 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.250
 I had this time 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.210
 To use the man score on the fan voting keyboard 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.830
 Almost 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.420
 It is not enough until it is limited 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.060
 While getting the impression that you will not get lost 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.890
 However, I thought that I was using the gate and it was a bit subtle 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.470
 Hidenobu a little 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.660
 I hope 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.000
 There is a relation that the center of the usual laptop computer is shifted. 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.460
 A group of Tokuji Tsuji 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.460
 I'm sorry if you see the hope 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.640
 The sense that the chief ordinary laptop computer and the chief referee are deviated 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.980
 There is a little 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.190
 So to the whole 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.380
 Kiwa town folks who feel discomfort in the position of the finger line 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.380
 There should be no problem at all 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.940
 After the backspace key is confirmed 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.970
 When leaving, combined use with function keys 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.780
 Are you 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.060
 Somewhere around there 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.060
 I feel like it is necessary until I can 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.090
 Slightly settled down here that I personally tried for convenience 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.210
 I am 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.610
 Most mobile phone 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.930
 It is a store where tsutaya bots are buried. 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:46.870
 But 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.200
 This button 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.200
 Just pull out your mouth 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.770
 In this feeling 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.750
 I wonder if everything comes out by hand 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.650
 It is already over 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:01.789
 iphone is unfair 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:03.040
 Like this 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.570
 Can hold 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.789
 Unfortunately still 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.769
 iphoneos 4.0 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:11.979
 Because it is ioc 

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:14.629
 Do you want to say something about it not being released? 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:15.759
 I can not do it 

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:19.979
 Currently in the law on the desktop to 8 thousand 

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:22.469
 You can use without problems 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:25.469
 At that time it can be said 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:28.889
 Enemy countryman 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:29.859
 In this fire 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:32.859
 Can be island 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:38.049
 I waited for there 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:39.749
 Keyboard 

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:41.779
 It has been 

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:45.199
 It is the difference of the keyboard, but the clue is standard of microsoft 

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:47.719
 And the size of the keyboard is obtained 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:50.719
 There is also the same size as the normal desktop season word 

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:53.729
 frozen 

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:57.809
 Tomoda Maeda is not used in the past either with thinkpadx300 

00:02:57.809 --> 00:03:00.809
 Totally protected is about the same size 

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:04.489
 The pedigree was in charge 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:05.879
 About this 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:10.549
 About 20% of the yen I got compared to iphone so I saw it first honestly 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.549
 When it was two or more big, there was a fight 

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:20.119
 Also the impression that the country does not have a thick star in the country 

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:22.519
 is 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.159
 Change to parts on the desk with Teppei and overseas models 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:29.859
 In combination with some numeric corporate function keys 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:31.219
 Tsukahara model 

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:33.609
 I think there was something, but when I use this 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:37.219
 After all the diary course is a pretty kiss too 

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:40.299
 If it is possible, it should be good if you have function key learning 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:41.809
 I thought so much 

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:45.409
 I take care of function well out of the relationship with using charts 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:48.819
 I think there is also a relationship to know 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.189
 Overwhelmingly and function keys are here 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:55.090
 -It is the second time to bloat, but from the left there is a day 2 left 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.399
 Each company's cooperative 

00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:59.189
 It is improvisational because it uses a model that has this 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:02.579
 I thought it was easy 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:06.389
 It is easy in this house, but there is a large starting point 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:09.409
 I would like to pay attention to 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:12.409
 A lot at the end 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.509
 It feels like this 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:20.509
 A work case will follow 

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:29.219
 Pet 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.080
 It looks like this when I move to the keyboard case 

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:38.400
 There is a virtual thing 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.890
 It is a little when using it from 30,000 times a year which is good for three-party change 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:43.289
 It feels good to be weak
