00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:05.810 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.390 

the<00:00:06.810> altitude<00:00:07.200> that<00:00:07.319> we<00:00:07.440> fly<00:00:07.680> at<00:00:07.859> is<00:00:08.010> actually

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
the altitude that we fly at is actually

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.790 
the altitude that we fly at is actually
above<00:00:08.639> 99%<00:00:09.269> of<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.750> atmosphere<00:00:10.290> which<00:00:10.590> means

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
above 99% of the atmosphere which means

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.470 
above 99% of the atmosphere which means
that<00:00:11.010> we<00:00:11.429> have<00:00:11.519> a<00:00:11.550> lot<00:00:11.790> of<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:12.030> same<00:00:12.210> physical

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
that we have a lot of the same physical

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.470 
that we have a lot of the same physical
challenges<00:00:13.259> as<00:00:13.440> flying<00:00:13.920> in<00:00:14.370> outer<00:00:14.519> space<00:00:14.639> and

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
challenges as flying in outer space and

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.700 
challenges as flying in outer space and
yet<00:00:15.809> we<00:00:15.900> still<00:00:15.960> have<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.289> deal<00:00:16.470> with<00:00:16.500> the

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
yet we still have to deal with the

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.429 
yet we still have to deal with the
chaotic<00:00:17.220> nature<00:00:17.400> of<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.789> wind<00:00:17.970> patterns<00:00:18.439> we

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
chaotic nature of the wind patterns we

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.019 
chaotic nature of the wind patterns we
need<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.710> know<00:00:19.830> what<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.100> winds<00:00:20.400> are<00:00:20.550> in<00:00:20.910> the

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
need to know what the winds are in the

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.820 
need to know what the winds are in the
stratosphere<00:00:21.390> so<00:00:21.900> we<00:00:21.990> can<00:00:22.109> surf<00:00:22.289> those<00:00:22.560> winds

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
stratosphere so we can surf those winds

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.250 
stratosphere so we can surf those winds
in<00:00:23.070> order<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.369> go<00:00:23.519> different<00:00:23.850> places<00:00:24.260> we've

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
in order to go different places we've

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.920 
in order to go different places we've
been<00:00:25.769> using<00:00:26.310> some<00:00:26.849> wonderful<00:00:27.240> data<00:00:27.420> we<00:00:27.720> have

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
been using some wonderful data we have

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.480 
been using some wonderful data we have
from<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.410> National<00:00:28.830> Oceanic<00:00:29.010> and

Atmospheric Administration which gives

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.560 
Atmospheric Administration which gives
us<00:00:31.560> their<00:00:31.920> best<00:00:32.130> predictions<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:33.059> which

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
us their best predictions of which

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.510 
us their best predictions of which
directions<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.260> winds<00:00:34.469> are<00:00:34.860> blowing<00:00:34.890> up<00:00:35.399> in

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
directions the winds are blowing up in

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.389 
directions the winds are blowing up in
the<00:00:35.610> stratosphere<00:00:36.800> they<00:00:37.800> get<00:00:38.040> their<00:00:38.219> data

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
the stratosphere they get their data

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.850 
the stratosphere they get their data
from<00:00:38.730> things<00:00:39.030> like<00:00:39.149> weather<00:00:39.660> balloons<00:00:40.020> but<00:00:40.559> as

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
from things like weather balloons but as

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.190 
from things like weather balloons but as
a<00:00:41.040> weather<00:00:41.790> balloon<00:00:41.969> goes<00:00:42.390> up<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.750> gets<00:00:42.809> larger

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
a weather balloon goes up it gets larger

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.979 
a weather balloon goes up it gets larger
and<00:00:43.320> larger<00:00:43.410> until<00:00:43.680> eventually<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.399> pops<00:00:44.989> so

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
and larger until eventually it pops so

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.690 
and larger until eventually it pops so
the<00:00:46.410> amount<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.710> time<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:47.129> spends<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:47.610> the

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
the amount of time it spends in the

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.930 
the amount of time it spends in the
stratosphere<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.270> pretty<00:00:48.899> limited<00:00:49.140> in

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
stratosphere is pretty limited in

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.400 
stratosphere is pretty limited in
comparison<00:00:50.940> we<00:00:51.719> all<00:00:51.870> have<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.050> fleet<00:00:52.289> of

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
comparison we all have a fleet of

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.869 
comparison we all have a fleet of
balloons<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.860> are<00:00:52.980> in<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.219> air<00:00:53.370> all<00:00:53.820> the

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
balloons that are in the air all the

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.180 
balloons that are in the air all the
time<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.870> course<00:00:54.899> we<00:00:55.230> have<00:00:55.320> GPS<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:55.980> we<00:00:56.039> can

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
time and of course we have GPS so we can

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.279 
time and of course we have GPS so we can
see<00:00:56.370> which<00:00:56.550> ways<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.270> wind<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.750> blowing<00:00:57.899> us

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
see which ways the wind is blowing us

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.229 
see which ways the wind is blowing us
and<00:00:58.649> said<00:00:58.890> we<00:00:59.039> all<00:00:59.160> have<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.340> very<00:00:59.640> rich<00:00:59.940> stream

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
and said we all have a very rich stream

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.020 
and said we all have a very rich stream
of<00:01:00.390> data<00:01:00.539> coming<00:01:01.020> into<00:01:01.140> our<00:01:01.230> system<00:01:01.879> you<00:01:02.879> can

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
of data coming into our system you can

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.750 
of data coming into our system you can
kind<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.239> imagine<00:01:03.390> putting<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.470> whole<00:01:05.189> bunch<00:01:05.610> of

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
kind of imagine putting a whole bunch of

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.910 
kind of imagine putting a whole bunch of
rubber<00:01:06.000> ducks<00:01:06.299> on<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.630> lake<00:01:07.049> or<00:01:07.320> an<00:01:07.409> ocean<00:01:07.530> and

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
rubber ducks on a lake or an ocean and

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.469 
rubber ducks on a lake or an ocean and
watch<00:01:08.159> where<00:01:08.400> they<00:01:08.520> float<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.820> you'd<00:01:09.270> get<00:01:09.450> a

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
watch where they float to you'd get a

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.480 
watch where they float to you'd get a
very<00:01:09.540> good<00:01:09.930> idea<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.380> what<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.340> water

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
very good idea of what the water

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.340 
very good idea of what the water
currents<00:01:11.909> are<00:01:12.000> doing<00:01:12.390> whereas<00:01:12.930> our<00:01:13.020> balloons

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
currents are doing whereas our balloons

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.719 
currents are doing whereas our balloons
would<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.680> show<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:13.890> what<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.159> air<00:01:14.280> cards<00:01:14.580> are

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
would to show you what the air cards are

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.499 
would to show you what the air cards are
doing<00:01:15.000> so<00:01:15.990> this<00:01:16.439> simulation<00:01:16.740> shows<00:01:17.549> how<00:01:18.450> we

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
doing so this simulation shows how we

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.980 
doing so this simulation shows how we
use<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.140> wind<00:01:19.320> data<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:20.280> predict<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.240> balloons

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
use the wind data to predict a balloons

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.859 
use the wind data to predict a balloons
trajectory<00:01:22.680> in<00:01:23.400> this<00:01:23.640> video<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.240> red<00:01:24.450> dot<00:01:24.659> in

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
trajectory in this video the red dot in

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.260 
trajectory in this video the red dot in
the<00:01:24.960> center<00:01:25.259> is<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.470> balloon<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.909> arrows

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
the center is the balloon and the arrows

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.319 
the center is the balloon and the arrows
around<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.869> are<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.619> predicted<00:01:29.280> wind<00:01:29.640> field

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
around it are the predicted wind field

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.499 
around it are the predicted wind field
so<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.170> can<00:01:31.409> see<00:01:31.560> as<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.490> wind<00:01:32.700> field<00:01:32.939> changes

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
so you can see as the wind field changes

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.800 
so you can see as the wind field changes
the<00:01:33.960> red<00:01:34.140> arrow<00:01:34.350> shows<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.189> velocity<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:36.390> the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
the red arrow shows the velocity of the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.080 
the red arrow shows the velocity of the
balloon<00:01:37.110> as<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.680> travels<00:01:38.100> through<00:01:38.220> this

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
balloon as it travels through this

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.630 
balloon as it travels through this
ever-changing<00:01:39.540> wind<00:01:40.020> field<00:01:40.250> one<00:01:41.250> question

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
ever-changing wind field one question

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.639 
ever-changing wind field one question
you<00:01:41.759> might<00:01:41.790> have<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.150> our<00:01:42.869> our<00:01:43.290> balloons

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
you might have is our our balloons

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.440 
you might have is our our balloons
actually<00:01:44.130> flying<00:01:44.399> at<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.700> same<00:01:44.880> speed<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.299> the

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
actually flying at the same speed is the

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.990 
actually flying at the same speed is the
wind<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.680> turns<00:01:46.920> out<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.369> we<00:01:47.640> can<00:01:47.850> tell

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
wind and it turns out that we can tell

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.859 
wind and it turns out that we can tell
that<00:01:48.030> they<00:01:48.270> are<00:01:48.450> because<00:01:48.600> we've<00:01:48.750> actually

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
that they are because we've actually

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.840 
that they are because we've actually
flown<00:01:49.290> microphones<00:01:49.860> on<00:01:50.009> our<00:01:50.130> balloons<00:01:50.460> and

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
flown microphones on our balloons and

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.210 
flown microphones on our balloons and
it's<00:01:51.329> very<00:01:51.780> quiet<00:01:52.200> when<00:01:52.530> we're<00:01:52.649> flying<00:01:52.920> in<00:01:53.130> the

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
it's very quiet when we're flying in the

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.950 
it's very quiet when we're flying in the
stratosphere<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:54.060> tells<00:01:54.420> us<00:01:54.570> there's<00:01:54.780> no

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
stratosphere that tells us there's no

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.139 
stratosphere that tells us there's no
wind<00:01:55.229> rushing<00:01:55.740> past<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.340> that's<00:01:56.729> because

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
wind rushing past and that's because

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.850 
wind rushing past and that's because
we're<00:01:57.479> flying<00:01:57.750> at<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.170> same<00:01:58.380> speed<00:01:58.619> as<00:01:58.770> the

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
we're flying at the same speed as the

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.550 
we're flying at the same speed as the
wind<00:01:59.040> around<00:01:59.250> us

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
wind around us

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.320 
wind around us
right<00:02:01.220> now<00:02:01.340> we're<00:02:01.549> only<00:02:01.580> flying<00:02:01.970> a<00:02:02.119> few

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
right now we're only flying a few

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.000 
right now we're only flying a few
balloons<00:02:02.630> but<00:02:02.810> we're<00:02:02.960> already<00:02:03.290> gathering<00:02:03.680> a

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
balloons but we're already gathering a

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.250 
balloons but we're already gathering a
lot<00:02:04.250> of<00:02:04.310> really<00:02:05.270> exciting<00:02:05.750> data<00:02:05.900> that's

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
lot of really exciting data that's

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.080 
lot of really exciting data that's
helping<00:02:06.500> us<00:02:06.650> understand<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.310> stratospheric

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
helping us understand the stratospheric

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.359 
helping us understand the stratospheric
winds<00:02:08.420> better<00:02:08.750> and<00:02:09.170> as<00:02:09.350> we<00:02:09.590> have<00:02:10.039> better

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
winds better and as we have better

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.100 
winds better and as we have better
understanding<00:02:11.060> that's<00:02:11.209> enabling<00:02:11.630> us<00:02:11.810> to<00:02:11.840> fly

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
understanding that's enabling us to fly

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.300 
understanding that's enabling us to fly
more<00:02:12.350> balloons<00:02:12.680> with<00:02:12.860> greater<00:02:13.069> confidence

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
more balloons with greater confidence

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.010 
more balloons with greater confidence
and<00:02:13.819> provide<00:02:14.090> ourselves<00:02:14.270> with<00:02:14.569> even<00:02:14.870> more

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
and provide ourselves with even more

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.110 
and provide ourselves with even more
data<00:02:15.260> so<00:02:16.130> we<00:02:16.220> have<00:02:16.310> this<00:02:16.430> ever<00:02:16.670> improving

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
data so we have this ever improving

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.720 
data so we have this ever improving
understanding<00:02:17.480> of<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:18.050> stratosphere<00:02:18.730> we've

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
understanding of the stratosphere we've

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.100 
understanding of the stratosphere we've
actually<00:02:19.910> been<00:02:20.150> talking<00:02:20.360> to<00:02:20.630> Noah<00:02:20.840> and

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
actually been talking to Noah and

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.470 
actually been talking to Noah and
working<00:02:21.890> with<00:02:22.010> them<00:02:22.220> to<00:02:22.250> feed<00:02:23.000> some<00:02:23.270> of<00:02:23.390> the

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
working with them to feed some of the

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.210 
working with them to feed some of the
data<00:02:23.660> from<00:02:23.930> our<00:02:24.110> balloons<00:02:24.470> back<00:02:24.739> into<00:02:25.069> their

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
data from our balloons back into their

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.940 
data from our balloons back into their
models<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:25.910> as<00:02:26.600> our<00:02:26.989> fleet<00:02:27.290> comes<00:02:27.560> fully

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.040 
models and as our fleet comes fully
online<00:02:28.220> we'll<00:02:29.180> be<00:02:29.300> able<00:02:29.390> to<00:02:29.510> significantly

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
online we'll be able to significantly

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.020 
online we'll be able to significantly
improve<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.220> quality<00:02:31.430> of<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:31.850> wind
