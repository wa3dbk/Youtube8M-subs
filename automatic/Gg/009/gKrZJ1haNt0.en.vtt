00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.060
 well i is fashion that I'm 30 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.800
 now makes three years that I 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.140
 works at tintin 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.180
 I was a painter for seven years before 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.880
 illustrator painter in the 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.039
 collective special jean and so here I am 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.140
 I 'm renewed in the tattoo for 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.269
 relearn everything in fact ie 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.100
 as the illustration 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:38.080
 it's a thing in itself but it 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.610
 not necessarily on the skin because 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.720
 that in tattooing there are things 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.820
 to respect for it to grow old 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.320
 for a long time that the lines do not 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.610
 do not put to bavay where to join for 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.250
 have a task effect so on a scale 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.229
 to respect concordance traits 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.909
 also who lives here that I must put 

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:53.769
 in place so that we do not have 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:55.809
 worries at the level of healing I 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:58.239
 do not think you have an atypical end 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.320
 maybe more now here is there 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.600
 more and more people coming out of the 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.920
 graphic design and the illustration that arrives 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.360
 in the tattoo more than a few 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.610
 days ago twenty years when 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.950
 maybe it was not the same medium he 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.830
 are several pieces I here 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.810
 I really appreciate it's mainly 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.369
 backs the two three active customers 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.020
 I made very large pieces 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.490
 stay my darlings working on the 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.840
 skin it's completely different has 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.060
 not right to the mistake already because we 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.289
 is not we do not have an eraser 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.590
 not on photoshop either there is no 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:25.590
 apple z 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:43.810
 yesterday you can ride a 14 please 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:46.799
 it brings me back - wes just yeah but 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.799
 between a little thicker there 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.460
 a big piece everything depends on the 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.320
 morphology of the person but when we 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.140
 tape back things like that there are 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.570
 still between 20:30 hours of work 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.430
 I tend to work on photoshop 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.010
 not bad the basic picture before she 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.110
 either to kill then the photoshop montage 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:12.660
 to have an overview of the 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:14.850
 project and the tattoo finish on his 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.560
 tattooed back an integral body necessarily 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.940
 it's a challenge for a territory 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.940
 so yes I would like to do it 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.040
 the world of tattoo obviously that 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.560
 it's important to participate it's the 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.580
 convention has not missed it's more than 300 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.200

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.070

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.250
 hyper important event for all and 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.250

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.500
 real showcase 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.470
 all those who are hesitant to 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.150
 tattooing have to continue to 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.900
 hesitate in fact a tattoo that's 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:30.270
 think it's not just like a 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.730
