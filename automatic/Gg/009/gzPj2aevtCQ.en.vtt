 teaspoon and a half of baking powder 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:46.110

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.239
 last to decorate we will need 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.420
 coloring of different colors that in my 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.110
 case I have chosen orange violet red and 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.970
 blue and some wafer daisies 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:12.270
 edible the first thing we're going to do 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.990
 is to mix the sugar in a big bowl 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.990
 with the eggs 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:29.520
 then we will mix the yeast 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.520
 with the flour 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.790
 and we will also do 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.930
 At this point you can put 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:45.220
 Preheat the oven to 200 degrees 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.220
 now we will mix the flour 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.560
 Now let's prepare our tray 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.560
 that will go to the oven 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.300
 and now we are going to fill the molds 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.870
 we will not get to half 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.459
 and we're going to have about 20 minutes to 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.459
 180 degrees 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.950
 when we take it out of the oven 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:27.680
 we will let cool on a grid 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.480
 Now let's make the base of the crim 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.590
 first thing we will do is take the 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.590
 butter tree 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.950
 then we are going to throw the sugar 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.930
 glas 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:44.790
 of little pieces and we are moving it 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.500
 now let's pour the milk 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.780
 and the orange blossom water 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.490
 As you can see we have our toilet cream 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.860
 at your point 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:58.420
 next we are going to start the 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.420
 screening in four parts 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.240
 now we will put a different color in 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.240
 each one of the goals 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.629
 As you can see we already have them all with their 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.629
 colour 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.350
 let's go cover our cupcake for 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.350
 over 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:36.460
 we will make three of each color after 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.710
 we will use a pastry bag with a 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.600
 open star mouthpiece and how 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:44.940
 final touch we will decorate with some 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.940
 edible wafer daisies 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.440
 we're done so we're going to 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.440
 try it to see how we have been 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.700
