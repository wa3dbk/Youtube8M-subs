 Hello friends, we warmly welcome 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.350

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.570
 Click I am pleased that you are here 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.059
 I would like to send something in advance and 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.519
 Although at the very end of this clip I have 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.570
 a message for you asks the clips 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.779
 look to the end 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.779
 thanks in advance I have recently 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.400
 a clip made because it was about oil have 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.130
 also get a few inscriptions in 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.230
 Among others, Chris makes 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.119
 but a video about how you look 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.960
 makes itself at chili oil or garlic 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.250
 or a herbal oil or or or 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.020
 and how the devil wants it 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.180
 as you know, always on the biggest 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:45.180
 I see a lot of shit in the supermarket 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:48.750
 next time my favorite packs 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.149
 chili with discount 50 percent because they say 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:57.420
 but thanks and that's why we do today 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:58.829
 a chili garlic rosemary as all 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.629
 First I want to tell you that it 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.149
 Of course there are other types of oil 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.299
 to make and also a wrong kind the 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.799
 I'll tell you what we wrong right away 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.810
 You can not do that 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.510
 chili as it is and the garlic 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.040
 peel and stick in and think in 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.110
 But half a year is oil today 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.700
 the oil will spoil you because there is so much 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.650
 too much water is in the garlic and in it 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.450
 chilli and so on and then rotten 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.549
 and look at that in the oil inside 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.630
 then all the oil could throw that away 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.460
 We do not want the second one is 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.320
 industrial production that is the 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.530
 animals are inlaid or bones 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.290
 In alcohol love alcoholic 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.240
 That's right, I usually hope so 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.130
 it is not ethyl alcohol but 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.500
 any sparkling alcohols or old ones 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.270
 fan zone or something else 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.670
 the water is withdrawn and afterwards 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.070
 Reprocessed it and then into the glass 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.380
 so that herbal oil stopped what he did 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.970
 the chilis are already buying in there 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.280
 are ready and great and everyone thinks 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.590
 Borken looks healthy 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.329
 since we are here in the potent 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.880
 are health funds and not in the 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.549
 anyway, everything looked at me 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.789
 The main thing tastes good is our kitchen 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.200
 together today a really good one 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.849
 herbal oil 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.680
 and I show that first thing you do 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:15.010
 I need it for that 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:19.550
 I have a red habanero here 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:22.129
 an original one yellow chili one 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.200
 then there were red chilli in the pack 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.519
 I still mushrooms trinh thi 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.690
 we do not use the page this time 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:31.010
 but I'll do something with them right away 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:35.319
 other then have one here on rosemary 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:38.000
 fresh ostrich and garlic 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.739
 I've taken 13 of that now 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.230
 Whole will be half the oil in about 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.760
 Your fantasies will be here again 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.680
 no limit set you can 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.220
 theoretically industry united and what 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:53.090
 you catch some juniper berries or on 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.280
 caraway or leaves remains the 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.890
 Fantasy leaves the power, however 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.110
 is always the same and now this time 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:05.860
 most important, the most important tool that 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:07.910
 We need money is the rubber glove 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.480
 believe me friends 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.310
 The there for 90 cents at the discount store 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.769
 And that is an investment that is up 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.019
 really worth it if you want it 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.579
 do not experience 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.680
 this is how you went about it yourself 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:25.250
 Be careful but only two are 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.560
 nothing makes it closer to onyx then 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.090
 in the evening on the couch think of nothing 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.639
 bad 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.230
 scratch yourself on the bag and about 30 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:35.900
 Seconds later, the wild luzie goes along 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.459
 you through because that's right 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.620
 hurt or later in the eye eye 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.600
 swollen use so my tip 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.290
 to you latex gloves or 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.720
 buy plastic gloves then needs 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.430
 her a baking paper i hope it looks 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:58.430
 one in the camera there now from the 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:04:00.130
 baking paper the whole stuff is natural 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.709
 grown 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.540
 the garlic is peeled and this time 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.680
 do not crush them so they'll be the same 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.680
 The game is just beautiful 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:21.620
 the chili just diagonally 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:23.290
 cut into two halves 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.330
 then so that looks like this 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:28.700
 that has the advantage if you now 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.560
 from then you can play the green with 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:34.220
 throw in and the sitter menu then 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.410
 but always very funny from the 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:43.940
 rosemary we cut a few branches 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:49.610
 even on baking paper on it was that 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:51.370
 wonderful the garlic the quarters we 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.380
 now in length 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.480
 I'll show you what it looks like here 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:00.020
 in the other camera and I want to 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.970
 To emphasize it puts everything on it that 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.980
 the cut pages upwards 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.230
 Show now, for example, the 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.640
 Pepperoni not lie down so that with 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.920
 the skin is pointing upwards but that 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:13.130
 the open side shows up and that 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:15.070
 All paper wrapping paper please submit 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:18.170
 now on the heater 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.820
 I really want to recommend you that 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:24.170
 all you have used now 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:27.890
 knife to bed or even the 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:30.490
 gloves are no longer usable 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:34.250
 because the haver neros are pigs sheep 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.810
 and the woman already said that is 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.670
 absolutely contaminated and if he is now 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.170
 then land somewhere and it does not notice 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:42.350
 you is behind all eye summarizes However, 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:46.460
 the screaming is great in a pro 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:49.460
 television broadcast in a profi 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.560
 TV show would show here 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.180
 have something prepared for me there 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.290
 it not so i always dried the 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.090
 habanero at home 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:58.340
 so you know how it will look in the end 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.540
 should I think so my camera 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.540
 It looks like when it is complete 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:06.020
 is dry if you do not open it 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:08.210
 cuts or with the skin to the outside 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.710
 it will not work on the baking paper league 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.380
 it dries and it will spoil you 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.760
 So be sure to pay attention if that 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.140
 whole dried now and so on 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:19.640
 I look like you right here 

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:21.260
 have shown so then you can put it into 

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.870
 olive oil or oil in your hand 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.120
 press in or 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.380
 Next to a container and fill it with oil 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.570
 up and squeezing his 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.000
 and hoops the hoops two to three 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:32.290
 months later you have a great one 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.110
 olive oil or a great spice 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:36.670
 Sorry I hope you have it 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.380
 fallen and now we come to the 

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:41.980
 note quite funny at the beginning said 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:46.060
 I have half a year a 

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:49.600
 oil and you can see that in here 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.990
 It is a very exclusive character 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:55.150
 in it 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:58.840
 That's a garlic chili habanero hat 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:07:00.370
 an amazing consistency and worth 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.710
 I do not want to describe it and that 

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:05.590
 I want to send one of you 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:07.360
 but one of my viewers is the point 

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:08.920
 I also need something from you and that 

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.330
 I would be happy if among you 

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.520
 someone is with the computer 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:14.740
 I would know something so well 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:19.330

 He does it to me and receives in return 

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:30.250
 the oil writes the best he wants the 

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:31.540
