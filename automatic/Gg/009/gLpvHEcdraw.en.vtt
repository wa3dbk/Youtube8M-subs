00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.300
 Chapter 7 

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:06.310
 it happened that when the king already lived 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.350
 at home after the jehovah had 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.860
 given rest of all his enemies in 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:14.110
 around the king said the prophet nathan 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.840
 look now I lived in cedar house and 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.480
 the ark of gods is between curtains and 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.520
 natan said to the king he is already all that 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.880
 is in your heart because jehovah is 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.489
 with you it happened that night that came 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.070
 word of jehovah to natan saying of 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:32.559
 my servant david would go like that has said jehovah 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.700
 you have to build me a house where I 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.559
 go dead 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.179
 I certainly have not lived in houses 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.489
 since the day that I brought children 

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:42.129
 Israel from Egypt until today but I have 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.079
 walked in tent and in tabernacle and in 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.719
 everything that I have walked with all 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.969
 children of Israel I have spoken word to 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:50.739
 some of the tribes of israel to whom 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:52.719
 have sent to feed my people of 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.809
 Israel saying why you did not tell me 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:58.030
 built cedar house now you'll say 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:00.730
 So my servant David said so 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.039
 jehovah of the armies I take you from the 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.199
 bust behind the sheep so that 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:05.680
 ruler over my people , 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.110
 Israel 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.010
 I've been with you in everything you've done 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.870
 walked 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.480
 in front of you I have destroyed all your 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.890
 enemies and I have given you big name as 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.040
 the name of the great ones that there are in the 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.380
 land I also fix the place to me 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.450
 Israeli people and I will raise it so that 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.880
 live in its place and never be 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.130
 removed or the wicked afflict him more 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.770
 as at the beginning since the day when 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.630
 I put judges on my people israel and 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.010
 I will give you rest from all your 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.990
 enemies 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.270
 Jehovah also lets you know that he 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.910
 will make home and when your days are 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.770
 compliments and sleep with your parents I 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.080
 I will raise after you one of your 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.620
 lineage which will come from your insides 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.870
 and affirms of his kingdom he builds the house 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.330
 to my name and I will affirm forever 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:55.660
 the throne of his kingdom and I would be the 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.880
 father and he will be my son and if he and 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.010
 he has bad I will punish him with a rod of 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.770
 men and with whips of sons of men 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:05.290
 but my mercy will not depart from 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.500
 him as the apart of saul which he removes 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.360
 in front of you and your house will be signed 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.490

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.069
 face and your throne will be stable 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.290

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.430
