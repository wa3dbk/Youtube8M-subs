00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.130 
here now the issues I had with the
gameplay<00:03:21.970> doesn't<00:03:22.270> stem<00:03:22.540> from<00:03:22.570> the<00:03:22.780> visuals

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
gameplay doesn't stem from the visuals

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.810 
gameplay doesn't stem from the visuals
more<00:03:23.350> the<00:03:23.470> way<00:03:23.590> in<00:03:23.800> which<00:03:23.950> the<00:03:24.100> actual<00:03:24.550> levels

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
more the way in which the actual levels

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.970 
more the way in which the actual levels
are<00:03:24.910> often<00:03:25.030> designed<00:03:25.450> in<00:03:26.080> certain<00:03:26.560> levels<00:03:26.709> the

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
are often designed in certain levels the

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.440 
are often designed in certain levels the
sheer<00:03:27.280> amount<00:03:27.370> of<00:03:27.550> bad<00:03:27.700> guys<00:03:27.970> they<00:03:28.150> throw<00:03:28.390> you

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
sheer amount of bad guys they throw you

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.970 
sheer amount of bad guys they throw you
is<00:03:28.780> just<00:03:29.230> ludicrous

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
is just ludicrous

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.280 
is just ludicrous
there<00:03:30.459> is<00:03:30.610> dozens<00:03:31.090> and<00:03:31.270> dozens<00:03:31.330> of<00:03:31.840> bad<00:03:32.050> guys

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
there is dozens and dozens of bad guys

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.350 
there is dozens and dozens of bad guys
firing<00:03:32.739> you<00:03:32.890> solely<00:03:33.250> regardless<00:03:33.880> of<00:03:34.030> the<00:03:34.090> fact

firing you solely regardless of the fact
that<00:03:34.600> you're<00:03:34.959> often<00:03:35.140> accompanied<00:03:35.560> by<00:03:35.590> half<00:03:35.980> a

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
encounters you just kind of have to run

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.420 
encounters you just kind of have to run
the<00:03:43.660> gauntlet<00:03:43.870> and<00:03:44.290> then<00:03:44.620> find<00:03:44.860> a<00:03:44.920> safe<00:03:45.160> place

and as a result the learning curve is

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.820 
and as a result the learning curve is
pretty<00:05:53.880> substantial<00:05:54.380> it<00:05:55.380> can<00:05:55.500> also<00:05:55.620> be<00:05:55.800> a

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
pretty substantial it can also be a

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.260 
pretty substantial it can also be a
little<00:05:56.040> bit<00:05:56.130> hard<00:05:56.370> to<00:05:56.460> find<00:05:56.730> a<00:05:56.790> game<00:05:56.970> going

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.880 
little bit hard to find a game going
that<00:05:57.390> doesn't<00:05:57.660> suffer<00:05:57.990> from<00:05:58.080> attrocious<00:05:58.620> lag

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:58.890 
that doesn't suffer from attrocious lag

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:00.710 
that doesn't suffer from attrocious lag
at<00:05:59.430> least<00:05:59.640> for<00:05:59.760> someone<00:06:00.000> like<00:06:00.090> myself<00:06:00.240> living

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 
at least for someone like myself living

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.870 
at least for someone like myself living
in<00:06:00.870> Australia<00:06:01.350> but<00:06:01.919> overall<00:06:02.220> this<00:06:02.460> mode<00:06:02.700> is

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
in Australia but overall this mode is

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.130 
in Australia but overall this mode is
still<00:06:03.120> enjoyable<00:06:03.540> and<00:06:03.810> its<00:06:03.930> really

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:04.140 
still enjoyable and its really

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:05.630 
still enjoyable and its really
interesting<00:06:04.410> seeing<00:06:04.919> how<00:06:05.040> refined<00:06:05.490> the

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:05.640 
interesting seeing how refined the

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.159 
interesting seeing how refined the
multiplayer<00:06:06.060> BOTS<00:06:06.330> before<00:06:06.930> they<00:06:07.050> just

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:07.169 
multiplayer BOTS before they just

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:09.050 
multiplayer BOTS before they just
overloaded<00:06:07.680> with<00:06:07.919> so<00:06:08.220> many<00:06:08.400> different<00:06:08.610> game

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
overloaded with so many different game

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:14.060 
overloaded with so many different game
modes<00:06:09.330> and<00:06:09.570> gimmicks<00:06:12.200> so<00:06:13.200> lastly<00:06:13.560> I<00:06:13.650> guess<00:06:13.950> it

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.070 
modes and gimmicks so lastly I guess it

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:15.200 
modes and gimmicks so lastly I guess it
comes<00:06:14.220> back<00:06:14.430> to<00:06:14.550> the<00:06:14.669> point<00:06:14.850> where<00:06:15.000> I<00:06:15.060> say

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
comes back to the point where I say

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:16.490 
comes back to the point where I say
whether<00:06:15.419> or<00:06:15.479> not<00:06:15.630> this<00:06:15.780> game<00:06:16.080> is<00:06:16.290> worth

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.500 
whether or not this game is worth

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.260 
whether or not this game is worth
playing<00:06:16.560> and<00:06:17.160> you<00:06:17.250> know<00:06:17.370> what<00:06:17.550> ultimately<00:06:18.000> I

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.270 
playing and you know what ultimately I

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.810 
playing and you know what ultimately I
would<00:06:18.660> say<00:06:18.840> it<00:06:18.960> is<00:06:19.220> there's<00:06:20.220> just<00:06:20.280> so<00:06:20.640> many

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:20.820 
would say it is there's just so many

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.400 
would say it is there's just so many
little<00:06:21.120> things<00:06:21.150> in<00:06:21.479> one<00:06:21.630> warfare<00:06:22.050> that<00:06:22.140> we<00:06:22.260> now

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.410 
little things in one warfare that we now

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.409 
little things in one warfare that we now
take<00:06:22.440> for<00:06:22.740> granted<00:06:23.130> in<00:06:23.400> FPS<00:06:23.760> games<00:06:24.120> from<00:06:24.300> the
