00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.010 
there's no reason to build anymore or
try<00:01:57.520> to<00:01:57.580> like<00:01:57.820> remake<00:01:58.330> things<00:01:58.630> because<00:01:58.900> you

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
try to like remake things because you

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.540 
try to like remake things because you
can<00:01:59.170> just<00:01:59.200> go<00:01:59.470> to<00:01:59.560> the<00:01:59.710> pc<00:02:00.040> version<00:02:00.070> and

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
can just go to the pc version and

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.870 
can just go to the pc version and
immediately<00:02:01.180> get<00:02:01.360> it<00:02:01.450> off<00:02:01.600> and<00:02:02.580> so<00:02:03.580> I<00:02:03.610> feel

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
immediately get it off and so I feel

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.580 
immediately get it off and so I feel
like<00:02:04.120> the<00:02:04.360> whole<00:02:04.480> pc<00:02:04.900> converter<00:02:05.200> thing<00:02:05.440> is

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
like the whole pc converter thing is

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.740 
like the whole pc converter thing is
