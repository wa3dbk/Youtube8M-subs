00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
the major one I think personally

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:36.980 
the major one I think personally
especially<00:01:35.970> for<00:01:36.090> hardcore<00:01:36.299> gamers<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.900> have

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
especially for hardcore gamers you have

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.480 
especially for hardcore gamers you have
headsets<00:01:37.439> microservice<00:01:38.009> dolby<00:01:38.340> surround

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
headsets microservice dolby surround

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.850 
headsets microservice dolby surround
sound<00:01:38.970> updates<00:01:39.360> at<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.630> moment<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.470> can<00:01:40.680> play

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
sound updates at the moment you can play

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.850 
sound updates at the moment you can play
7.1<00:01:41.490> surround<00:01:41.670> sound<00:01:41.970> but<00:01:42.659> it's<00:01:42.810> not<00:01:43.170> dolby

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
7.1 surround sound but it's not dolby

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.950 
7.1 surround sound but it's not dolby
it's<00:01:44.100> not<00:01:44.250> supported<00:01:44.670> by<00:01:44.700> dhabi<00:01:44.970> its<00:01:45.210> i<00:01:45.450> think

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
it's not supported by dhabi its i think

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.450 
it's not supported by dhabi its i think
at<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.110> moment<00:01:46.140> it's<00:01:46.649> just<00:01:46.829> like<00:01:46.950> 7.1

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
at the moment it's just like 7.1

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.490 
at the moment it's just like 7.1
surround<00:01:47.610> sound<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.270> cannot<00:01:48.659> have<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.020> dolby

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500

hard<00:07:14.349> drive<00:07:14.559> so<00:07:14.709> at<00:07:14.889> the<00:07:14.979> moment<00:07:15.219> it's<00:07:15.490> only

the future allowing more people can be

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:21.659 
the future allowing more people can be
