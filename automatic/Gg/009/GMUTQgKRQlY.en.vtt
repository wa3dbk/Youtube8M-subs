and I just add a little bit of tylose
powder<00:00:42.410> and<00:00:42.950> that<00:00:43.070> helps<00:00:43.400> it<00:00:43.520> keep<00:00:43.700> from

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:43.880 
powder and that helps it keep from

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.030 
powder and that helps it keep from
distorting<00:00:44.420> and<00:00:44.510> stretching<00:00:45.110> after<00:00:45.350> you've

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
distorting and stretching after you've

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.160

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.870 
cut it out when you move it so I just
kind<00:00:48.380> of<00:00:48.440> did<00:00:48.590> the<00:00:48.770> scalloped<00:00:49.340> edge<00:00:49.520> cutter

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
surface underneath it and it's really

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.030 
surface underneath it and it's really
important<00:01:01.970> to<00:01:02.030> have<00:01:02.120> a<00:01:02.180> scribe<00:01:02.510> or<00:01:02.690> tool<00:01:02.920> to<00:01:03.920> go

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
important to have a scribe or tool to go

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.969 
important to have a scribe or tool to go
ahead<00:01:04.280> and<00:01:04.460> get<00:01:04.699> those<00:01:04.969> pieces<00:01:05.299> out<00:01:05.979> they

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
ahead and get those pieces out they

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:08.859 
ahead and get those pieces out they
might<00:01:07.130> also<00:01:07.520> stick<00:01:07.820> down<00:01:08.030> in<00:01:08.210> here<00:01:08.509> on<00:01:08.630> what

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
might also stick down in here on what

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:10.450 
might also stick down in here on what
you're<00:01:09.020> working<00:01:09.170> on<00:01:09.469> and<00:01:09.530> that's<00:01:09.890> fine<00:01:10.280> as

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
you're working on and that's fine as

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.730 
you're working on and that's fine as
well<00:01:10.870> actually<00:01:11.870> it's<00:01:12.140> a<00:01:12.170> little<00:01:12.200> bit<00:01:12.440> easier

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
well actually it's a little bit easier

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.649 
well actually it's a little bit easier
to<00:01:12.799> get<00:01:13.010> it<00:01:13.130> out<00:01:13.280> of<00:01:13.310> here<00:01:13.850> and<00:01:14.030> it<00:01:14.150> is<00:01:14.240> out<00:01:14.540> of

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
to get it out of here and it is out of

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.080 
to get it out of here and it is out of
those<00:01:14.780> cutter<00:01:15.710> itself<00:01:16.190> but<00:01:16.700> it's<00:01:16.880> really

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
those cutter itself but it's really

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.000 
those cutter itself but it's really
important<00:01:17.510> not<00:01:17.659> to<00:01:17.720> let<00:01:17.990> those<00:01:18.140> build<00:01:18.500> up<00:01:18.770> and

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
important not to let those build up and

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.100 
important not to let those build up and
not<00:01:19.580> to<00:01:19.760> let<00:01:19.940> them<00:01:20.120> dry<00:01:20.479> in<00:01:20.690> there<00:01:20.840> so<00:01:21.049> you

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
not to let them dry in there so you

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.180 
not to let them dry in there so you
really<00:01:21.170> want<00:01:21.530> to<00:01:21.560> make<00:01:21.650> sure<00:01:21.830> you<00:01:21.920> remove

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
really want to make sure you remove

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.620 
really want to make sure you remove
those<00:01:22.400> sections<00:01:22.820> as<00:01:23.000> soon<00:01:23.150> as<00:01:23.240> you<00:01:23.330> cut<00:01:23.510> them

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
those sections as soon as you cut them

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.289 
those sections as soon as you cut them
out<00:01:24.130> so<00:01:25.130> over<00:01:25.159> here<00:01:25.549> I've<00:01:25.700> got<00:01:25.729> a<00:01:25.909> cake<00:01:26.270> that

of<00:01:35.150> here<00:01:35.600> and<00:01:35.780> out<00:01:36.380> of<00:01:36.530> here<00:01:36.799> so<00:01:37.010> that<00:01:37.159> the

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
of here and out of here so that the

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.340 
of here and out of here so that the
color<00:01:37.520> shows<00:01:37.850> through<00:01:38.150> from<00:01:38.360> behind<00:01:38.689> it<00:01:38.900> if

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
color shows through from behind it if

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.690 
color shows through from behind it if
you<00:01:39.439> want<00:01:39.650> to<00:01:39.710> go<00:01:39.799> back<00:01:39.979> and<00:01:40.189> ruffle<00:01:40.580> these

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
you want to go back and ruffle these

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.580 
you want to go back and ruffle these
edges<00:01:41.119> you<00:01:41.270> can<00:01:41.420> certainly<00:01:41.630> do<00:01:41.960> that<00:01:42.170> as<00:01:42.320> well

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
edges you can certainly do that as well

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.230 
edges you can certainly do that as well
but<00:01:43.310> I<00:01:43.400> just<00:01:43.610> want<00:01:43.729> to<00:01:43.790> kind<00:01:43.939> of<00:01:44.000> give<00:01:44.119> you<00:01:44.210> the

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
but I just want to kind of give you the

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.899 
but I just want to kind of give you the
basics<00:01:44.750> of<00:01:44.869> how<00:01:44.930> this<00:01:45.260> works<00:01:45.670> alright<00:01:46.670> so<00:01:46.820> you

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
basics of how this works alright so you

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.499 
basics of how this works alright so you
can<00:01:47.030> go<00:01:47.119> ahead<00:01:47.210> and<00:01:47.450> lift<00:01:47.659> that<00:01:47.869> up<00:01:48.580> and<00:01:49.580> maybe

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
can go ahead and lift that up and maybe

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.149 
can go ahead and lift that up and maybe
just<00:01:50.659> with<00:01:50.810> a<00:01:50.840> little<00:01:51.049> bit<00:01:51.140> of<00:01:51.170> piping<00:01:51.560> gel<00:01:51.799> you

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
just with a little bit of piping gel you

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.670 
just with a little bit of piping gel you
can<00:01:52.310> attach<00:01:52.640> that<00:01:52.939> to<00:01:53.299> there<00:01:53.540> so<00:01:53.810> one<00:01:54.500> other

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
can attach that to there so one other

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.929 
can attach that to there so one other
thing<00:01:54.920> that<00:01:54.950> you<00:01:55.130> can<00:01:55.250> do<00:01:55.430> to<00:01:55.610> add<00:01:55.700> a<00:01:55.729> little

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
thing that you can do to add a little

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:57.249 
thing that you can do to add a little
bit<00:01:56.060> more<00:01:56.240> detail<00:01:56.630> to<00:01:56.659> this<00:01:56.840> now<00:01:57.020> we'll<00:01:57.140> just

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
bit more detail to this now we'll just

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:58.600 
bit more detail to this now we'll just
say<00:01:57.409> that<00:01:57.560> this<00:01:57.650> is<00:01:57.830> still<00:01:58.040> on<00:01:58.159> the<00:01:58.280> cake<00:01:58.490> and

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
say that this is still on the cake and

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.039 
say that this is still on the cake and
attached<00:01:58.939> but<00:01:59.240> I<00:01:59.299> think<00:01:59.479> you<00:01:59.540> can<00:01:59.689> just<00:01:59.840> see

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
attached but I think you can just see

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:01.210 
attached but I think you can just see
what<00:02:00.170> I'm<00:02:00.259> doing<00:02:00.590> here<00:02:00.770> a<00:02:00.799> little<00:02:00.979> bit<00:02:01.070> better

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
what I'm doing here a little bit better

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.819 
what I'm doing here a little bit better
so<00:02:01.909> with<00:02:02.060> my<00:02:02.240> real<00:02:02.390> icing<00:02:02.689> I'm<00:02:03.049> just<00:02:03.350> going<00:02:03.590> to

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
so with my real icing I'm just going to

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:08.949 
so with my real icing I'm just going to
outline<00:02:04.250> a<00:02:05.259> little<00:02:06.259> bit<00:02:06.470> of<00:02:07.569> each<00:02:08.569> of<00:02:08.840> these

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
outline a little bit of each of these

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.830 
outline a little bit of each of these
sections<00:02:09.289> and<00:02:09.679> that<00:02:10.069> kind<00:02:10.340> of<00:02:10.429> mimics<00:02:10.970> maybe

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
sections and that kind of mimics maybe

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.020 
sections and that kind of mimics maybe
like<00:02:12.049> an<00:02:12.170> embroidered<00:02:12.680> edge<00:02:12.950> that<00:02:13.730> sort<00:02:13.970> of

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
like an embroidered edge that sort of

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.190 
like an embroidered edge that sort of
thing<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:16.700> it<00:02:17.060> really<00:02:17.209> makes<00:02:17.599> the<00:02:17.780> eyelid

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
thing and it really makes the eyelid

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.380 
thing and it really makes the eyelid
cutter<00:02:18.470> pop

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
cutter pop

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.370 
cutter pop
so<00:02:20.510> that's<00:02:20.660> a<00:02:20.750> detail<00:02:21.020> that<00:02:21.050> you<00:02:21.230> don't

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
so that's a detail that you don't

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.810 
so that's a detail that you don't
necessarily<00:02:21.530> have<00:02:21.980> to<00:02:22.310> do<00:02:22.430> but<00:02:22.580> it<00:02:22.640> really

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
necessarily have to do but it really

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.850 
necessarily have to do but it really
kind<00:02:23.030> of<00:02:23.060> makes<00:02:23.510> it<00:02:23.690> pop<00:02:23.930> out<00:02:24.110> at<00:02:24.320> you<00:02:24.470> even<00:02:24.650> a

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
kind of makes it pop out at you even a

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.410 
kind of makes it pop out at you even a
little<00:02:24.890> bit<00:02:25.130> more<00:02:25.340> but<00:02:26.030> if<00:02:26.120> you'll<00:02:26.240> take<00:02:26.360> a

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
little bit more but if you'll take a

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.000 
little bit more but if you'll take a
look<00:02:26.600> at<00:02:26.750> all<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:27.080> eyelet<00:02:27.440> cutters<00:02:27.710> we<00:02:27.830> have

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
look at all the eyelet cutters we have

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.320 
look at all the eyelet cutters we have
on<00:02:28.130> the<00:02:28.220> website<00:02:28.610> there's<00:02:28.820> a<00:02:28.880> really<00:02:29.120> wide

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
on the website there's a really wide

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.420 
on the website there's a really wide
variety<00:02:29.570> this<00:02:30.380> looks<00:02:30.650> really<00:02:30.980> cute<00:02:31.190> maybe

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
variety this looks really cute maybe

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.700 
variety this looks really cute maybe
it's<00:02:31.640> a<00:02:31.700> petticoat<00:02:32.150> underneath<00:02:32.360> a<00:02:32.750> dress<00:02:33.440> for

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
like a go and pace figure as I did here

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.480 
like a go and pace figure as I did here

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
even as a boarder a lot of times I've

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.260 
even as a boarder a lot of times I've
done<00:02:39.920> something<00:02:40.280> like<00:02:40.310> this<00:02:40.640> and<00:02:40.910> it's<00:02:41.090> like<00:02:41.180> a

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
done something like this and it's like a

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.690 
done something like this and it's like a
lace<00:02:42.050> tablecloth<00:02:42.890> overlay<00:02:43.340> and<00:02:43.520> that's

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
lace tablecloth overlay and that's

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:44.950 
lace tablecloth overlay and that's
really<00:02:43.970> pretty<00:02:44.180> as<00:02:44.300> well<00:02:44.330> for<00:02:44.660> like<00:02:44.750> maybe

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
really pretty as well for like maybe

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.960 
really pretty as well for like maybe
like<00:02:45.080> a<00:02:45.140> Tea<00:02:45.320> Party<00:02:45.680> so<00:02:45.860> really<00:02:46.580> the<00:02:46.700> sky's<00:02:46.940> the

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.240 
limit
on<00:02:47.630> your<00:02:47.900> imagination<00:02:48.020> on<00:02:48.590> how<00:02:48.800> to<00:02:48.860> use<00:02:49.070> these

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
on your imagination on how to use these

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.800 
on your imagination on how to use these
cutters<00:02:49.550> but<00:02:50.180> I<00:02:50.209> think<00:02:50.420> if<00:02:50.510> you'll<00:02:50.630> take<00:02:50.750> a

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
cutters but I think if you'll take a

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.000 
cutters but I think if you'll take a
look<00:02:51.050> at<00:02:51.140> them<00:02:51.290> they're<00:02:51.590> really<00:02:51.770> going<00:02:51.890> to<00:02:51.950> add

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
look at them they're really going to add

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.860 
look at them they're really going to add
a<00:02:52.070> nice<00:02:52.280> delicate<00:02:53.090> details<00:02:53.450> of<00:02:53.570> your<00:02:53.660> cakes
