00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.980
 after 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.449
 but 

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:35.829
 water everybody guys his clothes 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:37.300
 I hope you are well me 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:38.829
 hollandus I fart the form since when 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.180
 I recommend this video we are 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:41.559
 Thursday is like my french teacher 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.210
 is not there I bit short of art 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:44.649
 tell me it's really cool and I 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.359
 could you get out of three gameplay on the 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:48.010
 new dlc havok of edward dance 

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:50.110
 strong so I had already made you a 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.519
 video on the rifts map with one more 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.559
 quiet for about eight dead 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:54.699
 I believe and the video had not been 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.229
 accepted against who I voted 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:57.129
 in any case not for the moment they have 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:58.750
 says we end up for a gameplay 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.600
 a thousand times better since it is a 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.339
 vicious 46 killstreaks including 46 0 then 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.420
 after i've been to Montreal a lot of times so 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:06.130
 I do not have you but the end of the gameplay 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.240
 because it was not interesting 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.500
 do not worry we won the game 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.970
 and I would put maybe registered there 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.350
 the end to prove you all that for 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.610
 those who might doubt my role 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.350
 of objectives from elsewhere on silk lace 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.460
 black lighthouse frankly on swg like 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.720
 well play the goal is anyway 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.500
 to make big gameplay in assault 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.780
 we do not have a choice 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.759
 and suddenly a little vicious 46.0 on 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.020
 the body maps to the ball 27 and 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.970
 unfortunately not always dena 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.009
 cÃ´te d'azur this dlc already made you the 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.020
 video on the drift map like thursday 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.940
 with a more than 30 that they are there for 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.259
 a vicious on the body map that is 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.509
 already a grinder in stock his amap 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.549
 so slideshow the map with the clown and 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.469
 the bar I miss the whole map 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:39.759
 urban to make you a gameplay so I 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:40.359
 think I'm trying you a dna for the 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.950
 last video 

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:43.450
 and then after I'll make you a video in 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.969
 help shells so it will be a live 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.439
 secret where we will make the secret of the map 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:50.380
 how to make the amap of the agglo 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:52.750
 zombies i 'll be with jackie ahr conne 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.399
 and normally oxidizes it does offer down the 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.079
 secret live commented harry with a 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:57.549
 mini all at the same time as we do it and 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:58.780
 removes comments and I'll put you to 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:59.530
 the redif on my channel I think it 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.359
 you will be pleased 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.530
 and that's it for all and who will ask 

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:04.409
 when I will make a video about turf 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.219
 bibal will arrive this Saturday normally 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.570
 no problem at this level 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:09.039
 so I 'll introduce you quickly 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.280
 the map is the least 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.840
 things 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.430
 so this is the body map went into the 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.260
 desert I think you've seen it's 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.299
 a rocket launching area I think 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.170
 seen the big thing in the middle anyway 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:18.819
 it's a zone 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.870
 which is pretty destroyed and it's in the 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.849
 desert will be I'm sure he who has 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.230
 a lot of sand and killstreaks 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.540
 special of this map it's just 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.950
 decontamination drones at wholesale 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.300
 same principle the kid that you 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.500
 unlock a strategic package except that 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.270
 this time it's not with a suitcase and 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.709
 feet is really into having 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.050
 strategic codi in your classes or 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.550
 then unlocking the release of two 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.650
 strategic package there you know there in 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.090
 the end of the parties when they tell you 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.890
 there in 30 minutes you will have unknown 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.670
 in your part you know the 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.080
 shebang 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.670
 they simply go in this package 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.140
 you have some chance to have the 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.300
 decontamination drones and like the 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.190
 activate eh ben there are some drones coming out 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.760
 little blue circles to which I pass 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.989
 often beside 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.370
 Boy was small UAV 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.500
 decontamination is like drones 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.930
 assault it's round stuff and finally 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.730
 round round aside my dishes I do not know 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.980
 not how to say like in quarters like 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.690
 a like in quarters and flat but round 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.739
 I know I'm not very smart 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.269
 but in short you understand what I 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.440
 wanted to say anyway gets you 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.370
 go see a gameplay on youtube for 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.510
 see what it looks like or you 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.130
 look at the trailer we see in the 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.330
 trailer and these funny decontamination 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.920
 as it says it's like drones 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.810
 assault except they are not they have 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.209
 are flattened they will know on the sides 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.650
 but flattened on the tops and getting 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.870
 gave contaminations to 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.920
 knives end of the blades on the side and 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.000
 when they get close to the roomba there you 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.380
 that you're late when you're in 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.940
 the enemy team of the player who has 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.459
 unlocked decontamination drones 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.200
 they do not have rockets bed of 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.340
 machine guns just knives of 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.670
 blades on the side that can you 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.350
 cost 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.299
 so it's pretty easy in the breakaway 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.160
 then are not very deadly anyway 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.359
 I never unlocked them and a 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.739
 an enemy to unlock and 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:44.049
 mathieu with and I have pretty shaved for 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.070
 cgt to 25 for the d1 by the way for the 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.660
 little anecdote is so what the 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.950
 gameplay yeah there I follow quite a lot 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.959
 vicious happens sometime in the 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.400
 room ital I unlocked the vicious 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.859
 in about four minutes so that's 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.540
 not bad and I was in 46 0 I'm dead 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:56.859
 quite stupidly done because that's 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.450
 pretty disturbing when you're in 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:03:59.620
 domination and when the sleeve is over 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.140
 but you came in very big series 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.519
 and that, here I am, I start again 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.630
 second you know not too much where 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.430
 to go in fact it's quite complicated 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.840
 because you want to rock to do 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.370
 the most clips to targets but at the same 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.049
 time not too many chips you are afraid of 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.579
 to die and often at the beginning of the low end 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.120
 the first will move are enough 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:15.310
 rigid 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.359
 you do not know where to go finally it's 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.160
 what happened I wanted to go to 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.630
 left and the left side of the map in 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.910
 anyway me driving good it was my 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.900
 left side it's pretty ambiguous I'm going 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.060
 say because there are a lot of 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.229
 buildings is where I went there 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.330
 had a lot of campers she had 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:30.190
 finally there is a big top left and a 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.659
 big top in the middle and I saw that the 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.650
 guys camping I stubbornly staying 

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:34.210
 there and suddenly I died enough 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.890
 stupidly I'll tell you about it when that 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.050
 will arrive and so yeah in this dlc 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:40.419
 there was a compatibility pack so 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.130
 seen that the dlc and that about 360 and one for 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:44.620
 the moment the compatibility pack is 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:47.050
 happened that on 360 and wan and in this 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.010
 accountant park there is not that in this 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.080
 compatibility pack 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.280
 there is a patch of the bar girls 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.070
 arriving and will do quite chi 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.080
 of snipers and knife feeder kits and 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.979
 so in this patch of fidh and 25 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.330
 really what happens is that the 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:59.530
 girl lasts much less 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.510
 I think you've all noticed 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.800
 on a w when you do one he beats 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.810
 he really the long stays in 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.159
 the bar the wires and because of these 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.349
 packs and ben he stays publishes more 

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:10.210
 long at all in fact what 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:11.409
 a lot of people were complaining that's 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.849
 that on the double but for you do 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:14.229
 a kill if no one else does 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:15.700
 a lot of that he votes he can stay 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:16.000
 almost 10 seconds in the see of 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.409
 girls 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.280
 in any case he can stay quite 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:20.500
 a long time that's what I'm trying to say 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.120
 is that thanks to this patch end because of 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.560
 his pages earlier in front of your he's going 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.050
 stay that two three seconds even though 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.360
 no one has done that it is the same blow 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.099
 if you are sniper and that end but 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.300
 This is especially if you are the sniper 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:33.190
 20 even if you have four enemies 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.930
 sworn around you and that you do 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.700
 four wise as in a row 100% of 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.960
 accuracy without wasting time the 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.909
 faster possible even if you do 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.260
 that and vinci has no collateral you do not 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:42.789
 can not see the tail lakhouad fiden 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.870
 screen because it does not happen anymore 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:44.830
 so much at the helm a challenge of rapids 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.820
 that's what gives a screen the 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.810
 place more angry 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.060
 so you have to make a 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.440
 collection of two or three or 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.210
 four but I mean without glue hurry 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.320
 even if you are super accurate super 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.030
 fast you will not have a copy of a 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.159
 title he so I think the snipers 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.270
 and know it by really moaning and
