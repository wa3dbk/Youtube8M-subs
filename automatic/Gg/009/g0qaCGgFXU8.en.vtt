00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.580 
thing and i am recording this commentary
after<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.739> fact<00:00:40.920> by<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.219> way<00:00:41.780> the<00:00:42.780> Sun<00:00:43.050> bucco

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
after the fact by the way the Sun bucco

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.389 
after the fact by the way the Sun bucco
set<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:45.410> absolutely<00:00:46.410> required<00:00:46.590> for<00:00:47.219> this

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
set is absolutely required for this

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.779 
set is absolutely required for this
build<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.690> probably<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.710> only<00:00:49.980> pieces<00:00:50.489> of

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
build it is probably the only pieces of

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.850 
build it is probably the only pieces of
gear<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.390> absolutely<00:00:52.020> have<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.500> have

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
gear that you absolutely have to have

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.970 
gear that you absolutely have to have
there<00:00:53.129> are<00:00:53.340> some<00:00:53.699> differences<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.710> can

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
there are some differences that you can

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.010 
there are some differences that you can
make<00:00:56.460> if<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:56.879> don't<00:00:57.090> have<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.480> right<00:00:57.510> gear

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
make if you don't have the right gear

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.619 
make if you don't have the right gear
but<00:00:58.289> for<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:59.010> most<00:00:59.190> part<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.760> Sun<00:00:59.969> boko<00:01:00.300> set

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
but for the most part the Sun boko set

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.950 
but for the most part the Sun boko set
is<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.109> only<00:01:01.320> thing<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.890> will<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:03.329> really

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
is the only thing that will it really

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.550 
is the only thing that will it really
makes<00:01:04.439> this<00:01:04.769> build<00:01:05.659> luckily<00:01:06.659> these<00:01:06.990> next<00:01:07.350> four

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
makes this build luckily these next four

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.740 
makes this build luckily these next four
pieces<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:08.159> gear<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.790> can<00:01:08.820> actually<00:01:09.479> just

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
pieces of gear you can actually just

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.230 
pieces of gear you can actually just
craft<00:01:10.229> for<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:10.650> build<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:11.220> use<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.670> shears

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
set and finally we have my skills i'm

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:15.610 
set and finally we have my skills i'm
going<00:04:14.630> to<00:04:14.690> leave<00:04:14.810> this<00:04:14.960> one<00:04:15.110> up<00:04:15.170> there<00:04:15.380> for<00:04:15.590> a

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
going to leave this one up there for a

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.470 
going to leave this one up there for a
little<00:04:15.770> bit<00:04:15.920> longer<00:04:16.100> i'm<00:04:16.970> not<00:04:17.180> going<00:04:17.330> to<00:04:17.360> go

little bit longer i'm not going to go

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.250 
little bit longer i'm not going to go
into<00:04:17.799> great<00:04:18.799> insane<00:04:19.520> detail<00:04:20.030> with<00:04:20.540> each<00:04:20.840> of

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
into great insane detail with each of

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.500 
into great insane detail with each of
these<00:04:21.500> skills<00:04:21.920> because<00:04:22.400> uh<00:04:22.430> it's<00:04:23.210> fairly

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
these skills because uh it's fairly

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.310 
these skills because uh it's fairly
self-explanatory<00:04:23.990> but<00:04:24.830> uh<00:04:25.690> so<00:04:26.690> the<00:04:27.050> core<00:04:27.230> of

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
self-explanatory but uh so the core of

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.340 
self-explanatory but uh so the core of
this<00:04:27.410> build<00:04:27.680> is<00:04:28.600> spending<00:04:29.600> spirit<00:04:29.990> as<00:04:30.080> quickly

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
this build is spending spirit as quickly

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.440 
this build is spending spirit as quickly
as<00:04:30.560> possible<00:04:30.620> and<00:04:31.310> most<00:04:31.850> efficiently<00:04:32.330> as

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
as possible and most efficiently as

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.480 
as possible and most efficiently as
possible<00:04:32.510> and<00:04:33.020> in<00:04:33.140> order<00:04:33.320> to<00:04:33.410> do<00:04:33.710> that<00:04:33.860> you<00:04:34.070> use

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
possible and in order to do that you use

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.640 
possible and in order to do that you use
you<00:04:34.940> don't<00:04:35.180> use<00:04:35.450> an<00:04:35.600> actual<00:04:35.780> spirit<00:04:36.230> spender

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
you don't use an actual spirit spender

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.540 
you don't use an actual spirit spender
like<00:04:36.890> ltk<00:04:37.490> or<00:04:38.300> wave<00:04:38.960> of<00:04:39.110> light<00:04:39.290> you<00:04:39.740> just<00:04:40.040> use<00:04:40.280> a

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
like ltk or wave of light you just use a

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.790 
like ltk or wave of light you just use a
resource<00:04:40.940> generator<00:04:41.450> and<00:04:41.720> your<00:04:42.380> mansion

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
resource generator and your mansion

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.560

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
sweeping win because when you use those

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.850 
sweeping win because when you use those
it<00:04:44.900> doesn't<00:04:45.380> cancel<00:04:46.840> it<00:04:47.840> doesn't<00:04:48.200> cancel<00:04:48.440> you

obvious reasons get the toughness up
alacrity<00:06:05.639> just<00:06:06.120> because<00:06:06.360> you're<00:06:06.479> not<00:06:06.689> using

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
alacrity just because you're not using

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.980 
alacrity just because you're not using
anything<00:06:07.949> other<00:06:08.279> than<00:06:08.699> your<00:06:08.990> resource

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
anything other than your resource

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.860 
anything other than your resource
generators<00:06:10.590> we<00:06:11.460> can<00:06:11.610> eat<00:06:11.819> our<00:06:12.029> for<00:06:12.270> the<00:06:12.330> CDR<00:06:12.749> to

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 
generators we can eat our for the CDR to

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.950 
generators we can eat our for the CDR to
get<00:06:12.990> epiphany<00:06:13.499> and<00:06:13.590> breath<00:06:13.800> of<00:06:13.919> heaven<00:06:14.159> up<00:06:14.279> and

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 
get epiphany and breath of heaven up and

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.200 
get epiphany and breath of heaven up and
speaking<00:06:15.960> of<00:06:16.110> CDR<00:06:16.439> you<00:06:16.860> want<00:06:17.069> to<00:06:17.159> get<00:06:17.279> CDR<00:06:17.879> on

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210 
speaking of CDR you want to get CDR on

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.089 
speaking of CDR you want to get CDR on
your<00:06:18.479> stuff<00:06:18.930> instead<00:06:19.379> of<00:06:19.439> resource<00:06:19.830> cost

00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:20.099 
your stuff instead of resource cost

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:24.860 
your stuff instead of resource cost
reduction<00:06:20.639> because<00:06:22.490> if<00:06:23.490> you<00:06:24.360> get<00:06:24.509> resource

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
reduction because if you get resource

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.330 
reduction because if you get resource
cost<00:06:25.110> reduction<00:06:25.529> then<00:06:25.710> whenever<00:06:25.919> you<00:06:26.129> use

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.340 
cost reduction then whenever you use

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.610 
cost reduction then whenever you use
your<00:06:26.520> sweeping<00:06:27.000> wind<00:06:27.270> you<00:06:27.930> don't<00:06:28.199> you<00:06:28.439> have<00:06:28.529> to
