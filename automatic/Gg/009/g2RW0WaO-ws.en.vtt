people they felt they should have made
another<00:02:12.390> mold<00:02:12.629> so<00:02:12.750> I'm<00:02:12.870> think

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
another mold so I'm think

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.240 
another mold so I'm think
okay<00:02:14.100> with<00:02:14.250> this<00:02:14.810> is<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:15.930> good<00:02:16.319> figure<00:02:16.560> I<00:02:16.920> heard

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
okay with this is a good figure I heard

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.949 
okay with this is a good figure I heard
this<00:02:17.459> one's<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:17.819> lot<00:02:17.940> better<00:02:18.090> than<00:02:18.569> the<00:02:18.660> old<00:02:18.810> one

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
this one's a lot better than the old one

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.809 
this one's a lot better than the old one
with<00:02:19.740> a<00:02:19.819> newer<00:02:20.819> joint<00:02:21.270> in<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.569> head<00:02:21.720> it<00:02:21.840> seems

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
with a newer joint in the head it seems

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.559 
with a newer joint in the head it seems
in<00:02:23.819> better<00:02:24.000> paint<00:02:24.330> so<00:02:25.850> and<00:02:26.850> he<00:02:26.940> looks<00:02:27.240> he<00:02:27.540> looks

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
in better paint so and he looks he looks

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.770 
in better paint so and he looks he looks
great<00:02:28.819> compared<00:02:29.819> to<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:30.000> three<00:02:30.270> inch<00:02:30.390> figures

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
great compared to the three inch figures

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.170 
great compared to the three inch figures
from<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:30.989> line<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.709> detail<00:02:32.069> is<00:02:32.100> great<00:02:32.819> yeah

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
from the line the detail is great yeah

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.420 
from the line the detail is great yeah
some<00:02:33.510> weird<00:02:33.780> paint<00:02:34.380> blotches<00:02:34.830> here<00:02:35.100> but<00:02:35.400> I

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
some weird paint blotches here but I

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.130 
some weird paint blotches here but I
think<00:02:35.940> it's<00:02:36.030> fine<00:02:36.180> it's<00:02:36.330> easy<00:02:36.480> fix<00:02:36.810> if<00:02:36.959> it

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
think it's fine it's easy fix if it

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.290 
think it's fine it's easy fix if it
bothered<00:02:37.830> me<00:02:37.950> that<00:02:37.980> much<00:02:38.280> he<00:02:39.000> seemed<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.180> have

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
bothered me that much he seemed to have

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.030 
bothered me that much he seemed to have
some<00:02:39.420> sort<00:02:39.540> of<00:02:39.660> a<00:02:39.750> smirk<00:02:40.050> which<00:02:40.739> I<00:02:40.830> don't<00:02:40.890> mind

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
some sort of a smirk which I don't mind

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.760 
some sort of a smirk which I don't mind
I<00:02:41.489> think<00:02:41.760> looks<00:02:41.880> fine<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:43.020> jowl<00:02:43.260> kind<00:02:43.650> of

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
I think looks fine the jowl kind of

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.530 
I think looks fine the jowl kind of
resembles<00:02:44.370> Christian<00:02:44.700> Bale<00:02:44.819> a<00:02:44.850> little<00:02:45.209> bit<00:02:45.330> in

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
resembles Christian Bale a little bit in

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.680 
resembles Christian Bale a little bit in
the<00:02:45.630> eyes<00:02:45.810> looking<00:02:46.680> up<00:02:46.800> just<00:02:47.130> you<00:02:47.430> know<00:02:47.690> really

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
the eyes looking up just you know really

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.210 
the eyes looking up just you know really
cool<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.140> only<00:02:49.320> thing<00:02:49.440> throws<00:02:49.620> me<00:02:49.800> off<00:02:49.890> is<00:02:50.070> the

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
cool the only thing throws me off is the

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.920 
cool the only thing throws me off is the
awkward<00:02:50.610> shoulder<00:02:53.150> like<00:02:54.150> it<00:02:54.300> just<00:02:54.450> big<00:02:54.660> arch

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
awkward shoulder like it just big arch

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.520 
awkward shoulder like it just big arch
with<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.290> Cape<00:02:56.030> counts<00:02:57.030> of<00:02:57.120> Gaul<00:02:57.530> weirdly

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
with the Cape counts of Gaul weirdly

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.120 
with the Cape counts of Gaul weirdly
proportion<00:02:59.010> but<00:02:59.100> I<00:02:59.160> think<00:02:59.340> it's<00:02:59.459> fine<00:03:00.980> all<00:03:01.980> the

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
proportion but I think it's fine all the

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.280 
proportion but I think it's fine all the
way<00:03:02.220> down<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.430> arms<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:03.209> straps<00:03:03.540> really<00:03:03.989> cool

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
way down the arms the straps really cool

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.030 
way down the arms the straps really cool
all<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:05.100> way<00:03:05.190> across<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.459> gauntlet<00:03:06.920> where<00:03:07.920> is

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
all the way across the gauntlet where is

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.430 
all the way across the gauntlet where is
these<00:03:08.220> ones<00:03:08.400> are<00:03:08.519> fine<00:03:08.760> but<00:03:09.209> on<00:03:10.019> this<00:03:10.200> arm

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
these ones are fine but on this arm

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.790 
these ones are fine but on this arm
these<00:03:10.830> are<00:03:11.040> these<00:03:11.430> two<00:03:11.850> are<00:03:11.970> split<00:03:12.590> so<00:03:13.590> I<00:03:13.620> don't

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
ring onto it that's that's fantastic if

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.259 
ring onto it that's that's fantastic if
it<00:03:41.280> getting<00:03:41.489> these<00:03:41.579> paint<00:03:41.850> all<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.209> way
