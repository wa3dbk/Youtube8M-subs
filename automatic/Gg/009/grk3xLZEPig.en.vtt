00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
start an adventure map or a mini map or

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.519 
start an adventure map or a mini map or
a<00:00:21.270> puzzle<00:00:21.449> map<00:00:21.750> or<00:00:21.960> something<00:00:22.050> along<00:00:22.289> those

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
a puzzle map or something along those

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.740 
a puzzle map or something along those
lines<00:00:22.590> so<00:00:23.070> I<00:00:23.250> thought<00:00:24.090> I<00:00:24.330> would<00:00:24.390> do<00:00:25.230> that<00:00:25.699> so<00:00:26.750> if

lines so I thought I would do that so if

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.589 
lines so I thought I would do that so if

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.069 
you wait one second i'll be back with a
puzzle<00:00:31.289> map<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.710> here<00:00:32.460> we<00:00:32.610> are<00:00:32.850> so<00:00:33.300> i<00:00:33.570> made<00:00:33.899> a

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
puzzle map and here we are so i made a

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.119 
puzzle map and here we are so i made a
lot<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.320> progress<00:00:34.640> and<00:00:36.710> this<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:37.860> what<00:00:38.010> I've

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
lot of progress and this is what I've

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.869 
lot of progress and this is what I've
come<00:00:38.160> up<00:00:38.370> with<00:00:38.430> so<00:00:38.820> this<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:40.730> puzzle<00:00:41.730> map

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
come up with so this is a a puzzle map

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.979 
come up with so this is a a puzzle map
based<00:00:42.690> around<00:00:43.170> my<00:00:43.950> anti-gravity<00:00:44.820> video<00:00:45.629> that

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
based around my anti-gravity video that

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.279 
based around my anti-gravity video that
I<00:00:46.020> did<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.230> long<00:00:46.590> long<00:00:46.860> long<00:00:47.100> time<00:00:47.489> ago<00:00:47.660> and<00:00:48.660> I

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
I did a long long long time ago and I

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.170 
I did a long long long time ago and I
thought<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.620> was<00:00:49.770> such<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.309> good<00:00:50.550> idea<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:51.030> I

thought it was such a good idea that I

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.500 
thought it was such a good idea that I
wanted<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.350> start<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.190> Mac<00:00:53.820> making<00:00:54.120> series

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
wanted to start a Mac making series

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.349 
wanted to start a Mac making series
where<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:55.100> make<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.480> full<00:00:57.530> puzzle<00:00:58.530> map<00:00:58.620> out<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.949> it

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 
where I make a full puzzle map out of it

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:02.500 
where I make a full puzzle map out of it
so<00:01:00.359> as<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.840> can<00:01:00.930> see<00:01:01.109> made<00:01:01.379> lots<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.649> progress

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
so as you can see made lots of progress

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.549 
so as you can see made lots of progress
so<00:01:03.510> yeah<00:01:03.660> this<00:01:03.809> should<00:01:03.960> be<00:01:04.080> enough<00:01:04.170> progress

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
ok so the true story behind this map all

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.789 
ok so the true story behind this map all
started<00:01:22.460> about<00:01:22.640> a<00:01:23.060> year<00:01:23.119> ago<00:01:23.680> during<00:01:24.680> that

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
started about a year ago during that

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:26.679 
started about a year ago during that
time<00:01:24.860> I<00:01:25.220> was<00:01:25.399> getting<00:01:25.670> lots<00:01:25.939> of<00:01:26.119> requests<00:01:26.540> from

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
time I was getting lots of requests from

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:28.570 
time I was getting lots of requests from
people<00:01:26.899> to<00:01:27.259> start<00:01:27.649> an<00:01:27.740> adventure<00:01:28.189> map<00:01:28.220> or<00:01:28.549> a

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
people to start an adventure map or a

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.810 
people to start an adventure map or a
minigame<00:01:29.470> these<00:01:30.470> suggestions<00:01:30.950> were<00:01:31.490> quickly

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
minigame these suggestions were quickly

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.999 
minigame these suggestions were quickly
refuted<00:01:32.360> by<00:01:32.539> me<00:01:32.869> claiming<00:01:33.409> that<00:01:33.590> I<00:01:33.799> did<00:01:33.979> not

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
refuted by me claiming that I did not

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:35.920 
refuted by me claiming that I did not
have<00:01:34.250> the<00:01:34.399> patience<00:01:34.880> to<00:01:34.970> commit<00:01:35.390> myself<00:01:35.570> to

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
have the patience to commit myself to

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.840 
have the patience to commit myself to
something<00:01:36.259> that<00:01:36.710> would<00:01:36.860> could<00:01:37.070> take<00:01:37.250> weeks<00:01:37.490> or

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
something that would could take weeks or

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.539 
something that would could take weeks or
even<00:01:38.000> months<00:01:38.270> to<00:01:38.570> complete<00:01:39.250> however<00:01:40.250> when<00:01:40.490> I

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
even months to complete however when I

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.789 
even months to complete however when I
came<00:01:40.670> up<00:01:40.939> with<00:01:40.970> my<00:01:41.090> anti-gravity<00:01:41.590> concept<00:01:42.590> I

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
came up with my anti-gravity concept I

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:44.830 
came up with my anti-gravity concept I
thought<00:01:43.310> it<00:01:43.430> was<00:01:43.549> the<00:01:43.670> perfect<00:01:43.700> idea<00:01:44.390> for<00:01:44.600> a

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
thought it was the perfect idea for a

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.279 
thought it was the perfect idea for a
puzzle<00:01:45.170> map<00:01:45.320> and<00:01:45.560> I<00:01:45.799> started<00:01:46.340> one<00:01:46.659> but<00:01:47.659> i<00:01:47.990> did

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
puzzle map and I started one but i did

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:51.520 
puzzle map and I started one but i did
not<00:01:48.440> get<00:01:48.649> very<00:01:48.860> far<00:01:49.009> before<00:01:49.640> i<00:01:49.880> gave<00:01:50.149> up<00:01:50.530> still

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
not get very far before i gave up still

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.820 
not get very far before i gave up still
thinking<00:01:51.920> it<00:01:52.069> was<00:01:52.220> a<00:01:52.250> good<00:01:52.520> idea<00:01:52.580> i<00:01:53.830> contacted

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
thinking it was a good idea i contacted

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.980 
thinking it was a good idea i contacted
omega<00:01:55.220> craftable<00:01:55.789> and<00:01:56.179> together<00:01:56.450> we

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
omega craftable and together we

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.230 
omega craftable and together we
resurrected<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:57.920> map<00:01:58.130> and<00:01:58.369> managed<00:01:59.210> to

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
resurrected the map and managed to

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.330 
resurrected the map and managed to
complete<00:01:59.659> most<00:02:00.020> of<00:02:00.170> the<00:02:00.229> levels<00:02:00.440> and<00:02:00.770> were<00:02:01.100> on

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
complete most of the levels and were on

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.520 
complete most of the levels and were on
our<00:02:01.399> way<00:02:01.640> to<00:02:01.759> completing<00:02:02.330> the<00:02:02.840> Redstone<00:02:03.259> for

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
our way to completing the Redstone for

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.690 
our way to completing the Redstone for
them<00:02:04.000> however<00:02:05.000> again<00:02:05.990> we<00:02:06.770> both<00:02:06.950> lost<00:02:07.190> interest

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
them however again we both lost interest

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.210 
them however again we both lost interest
in<00:02:07.970> we<00:02:08.539> just<00:02:08.720> gave<00:02:08.899> up<00:02:09.110> and<00:02:09.380> it<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:09.890> whole<00:02:10.039> map

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
in we just gave up and it the whole map
