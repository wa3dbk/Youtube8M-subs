00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:11.490
 Hi everyone, everything good today's video is a 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.380
 tutorial of a super simple hairstyle that 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.389
 You can use it to work with a dinner party. 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.940
 for the important meeting 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.189
 carefully if it was a style if 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.340
 You look more or less like that. 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.410
 romantic style, you can use it for 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.289
 a lot of confusion starts with your hair 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.140
 smooth or curly irrespective of the 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:35.489
 how you prefer it and we 'll go 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.649
 make a low ponytail by leaving the 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.829
 hair covering both ears passing 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.239
 the hair above the ear is seeing 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.430
 nothing mysterious and you can leave the 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:55.430
 party hair in the middle or party 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:55.430
 side as you prefer very simple 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.020
 Silicone argument not to appear right 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.489
 to be discreet and I 'm doing 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.549
 she slowly so simply 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.530
 because I was afraid to munch 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:09.810
 I do not know how you guys are 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.360
 call but I had when I speak gomide and 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.990
 when it speaks elastic and it is without tail of 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.939
 horse 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.340
 There you go and get the ponytail going. 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.799
 make a normal braid will split into 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.280
 three equal parts will make a braid 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:31.350
 normal as everyone does every day 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:33.720
 hour picks point with another moment 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.130
 silicone 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.130
 Until then, nothing complicated. 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.579
 There you go and pull a braid. 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.130
 to gain volume 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:53.399
 I do not have much hair I need 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:54.420
 volume and then you will roll the braid on her 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.240
 same 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.310
 leaving the outside edge inside looks 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.680
 only have I fixed the outside in 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:06.680
 Why do you want to stay in place? 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.789
 hidden there inside the braid wraps 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.390
 pushes the hair for us will feel 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.000
 with her hand as if this is coke and there is 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.220
 just beach 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.900
 it is with very simple clamp very easy 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.940
 I always like to fasten the clamp on 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.650
 several directions downwards without 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.600
 work from right to left of the 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.250
 left to right at least for me 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.440
 make sure the glass is firm 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:35.700
 I have to feel him also very firm in the 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:35.700
 my head is pretty staple 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.799
 It's a very well- dressed hairstyle. 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.170
 in that perfect wonderful wedding 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.879
 Right, I do not like him, and yes. 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.069
 now if you want a more 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:57.060
 right you put more staple hides 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:59.310
 well all the tips make a coke more 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.659
 round I did it in a more 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.280
 informal 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:04.530
 you can leave the bangs loose when 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.340
 I left on both sides that she ended up 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.859
 releasing the fiap that stayed out 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.719
 So I went to solve it because I 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:15.389
 I did not like it, I thought it was cool. 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:19.590
 I spent a lot of expresss I 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:21.959
 Hold it tight as I was going 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.829
 saying you can leave the fringe is the 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:28.889
 sides that fall on the face loose 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:32.010
 or you can let her hold loose her 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:34.799
 looks like or you can hold a 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.459
 left France and released and 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.459
 other side 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:44.010
 this is the final alternative profit 1 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.500
 now you can pass the wick that is 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.799
 loose over the ear and pass 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:57.209
 Enough spray I dare you to do without 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:59.840
 make a face at putting hair on 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.840
 groin 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:11.459
 in the end it is thus stripped a little 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:13.259
 more tidy more formal for dinner 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.509
 depends a lot on your fashion style 

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:17.370
 As you like to dress, but I 

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:21.199
 I love the type of hairstyle I hope you 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.199
 also liked a kiss
