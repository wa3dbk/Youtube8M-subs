00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
posting schedule but I have some ideas

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.260

for some full length videos that I want

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.170 
for some full length videos that I want

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
to do while I'm up there and while I

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.040 
to do while I'm up there and while I
probably<00:03:49.510> won't<00:03:49.810> be<00:03:49.989> able<00:03:50.170> to<00:03:50.440> upload<00:03:51.160> those

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
probably won't be able to upload those

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.770 
probably won't be able to upload those
while<00:03:53.050> I'm<00:03:53.320> away<00:03:53.709> I<00:03:54.070> will<00:03:54.820> be<00:03:55.500> saving<00:03:56.500> them<00:03:56.680> and

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
while I'm away I will be saving them and

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:06.700 
while I'm away I will be saving them and
uploading<00:03:58.780> them<00:04:00.330> when<00:04:01.330> I<00:04:01.360> get<00:04:01.600> back<00:04:03.690> so

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:06.710 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.960 

we<00:04:07.310> want<00:04:07.580> to<00:04:07.670> travel<00:04:07.880> from<00:04:08.300> one<00:04:09.430> area<00:04:10.430> of<00:04:10.670> the

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
we want to travel from one area of the

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.360 
we want to travel from one area of the
country<00:04:11.120> to<00:04:11.480> another<00:04:11.720> and<00:04:12.130> hopefully<00:04:13.130> we'll

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
country to another and hopefully we'll

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.250 
country to another and hopefully we'll
have<00:04:13.550> a<00:04:13.580> very<00:04:13.850> good<00:04:14.000> time<00:04:14.800> and<00:04:16.450> the<00:04:17.450> cold<00:04:17.900> is

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260

trying to take over my body will

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:27.040 
trying to take over my body will
hopefully<00:04:22.480> go<00:04:23.480> away<00:04:24.850> and<00:04:25.850> will<00:04:26.570> not<00:04:26.690> affect

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
hopefully go away and will not affect

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.940 
hopefully go away and will not affect
the<00:04:27.140> trip<00:04:29.020> so<00:04:30.020> we'll<00:04:30.350> be<00:04:30.440> driving<00:04:30.650> for

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
the trip so we'll be driving for

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:36.640 
the trip so we'll be driving for
probably<00:04:31.280> about<00:04:32.500> seven<00:04:33.500> hours<00:04:35.170> so<00:04:36.170> we'll<00:04:36.470> be

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
probably about seven hours so we'll be

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:42.550 
probably about seven hours so we'll be
having<00:04:36.920> a<00:04:38.230> few<00:04:39.230> stops<00:04:40.330> along<00:04:41.330> the<00:04:41.540> way<00:04:41.690> so<00:04:42.530> we

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
having a few stops along the way so we

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.560 
having a few stops along the way so we
will<00:04:42.800> be<00:04:42.920> doing<00:04:43.040> it<00:04:43.220> straight<00:04:43.550> which<00:04:44.360> is<00:04:44.570> good

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
will be doing it straight which is good

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.860 
will be doing it straight which is good
so<00:04:47.570> that<00:04:47.900> is<00:04:48.170> a<00:04:48.200> basic<00:04:48.650> update<00:04:49.130> video

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870
