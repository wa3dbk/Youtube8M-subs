00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.170
 to play wirelessly 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.359
 In addition, we still need a host 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.189
 cable something in the store for about two 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.660
 euro or synonymous with sony directly 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.280

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.829
 another usb cable which he 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.559

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.050
 ps3 controllers can use the usb 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.680

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.420

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.100
 flap on the left side of the tablet 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.489
 is a small USB port hidden 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.460

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.310

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.140
 connection of your sony ps3 controller 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.710
 with the tablet now it starts 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.540
 canned 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.640
 if you only turn on the tablet and 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.890
 it elicits it right in the bottom 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.780

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.409
 small indicator in the lower right 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.479
 area where it is shown that one 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.799

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.030
