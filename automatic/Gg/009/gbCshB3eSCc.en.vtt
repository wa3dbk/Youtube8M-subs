00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
now we have a new smart field yeah it's

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.860 
now we have a new smart field yeah it's
exciting<00:00:32.700> so<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.420> know<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.570> were<00:00:33.719> just

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
exciting so you know you were just

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.630 
exciting so you know you were just
telling<00:00:34.110> me<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.350> this<00:00:34.649> thing<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.340> much

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
telling me that this thing is is much

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.510 
telling me that this thing is is much
lighter<00:00:35.969> it's<00:00:36.480> more<00:00:36.750> efficient<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:38.100> little

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
lighter it's more efficient and a little

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.880 
lighter it's more efficient and a little
bit<00:00:38.640> more<00:00:38.790> compact<00:00:39.239> is<00:00:39.510> that<00:00:39.660> right<00:00:39.840> yeah<00:00:40.590> so

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
bit more compact is that right yeah so

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.420 
bit more compact is that right yeah so
the<00:00:41.190> previous<00:00:41.910> design<00:00:42.239> had<00:00:42.600> was<00:00:43.170> 9<00:00:43.590> pounds<00:00:44.010> and

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
the previous design had was 9 pounds and

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.340 
the previous design had was 9 pounds and
it<00:00:44.730> was<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.879> really<00:00:45.210> big<00:00:45.480> wheel<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.140> now<00:00:46.289> we

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
it was a really big wheel and now we

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.819 
it was a really big wheel and now we
have<00:00:46.680> only<00:00:47.480> 5<00:00:48.480> pounds<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:49.079> it's<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.680> really

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
have only 5 pounds and it's a really

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.650 
have only 5 pounds and it's a really
small<00:00:50.129> wheel<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.640> can<00:00:50.789> really<00:00:51.059> fit<00:00:51.390> on<00:00:51.539> any

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
small wheel so you can really fit on any

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.580 
small wheel so you can really fit on any
bicycle<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.530> doesn't<00:00:52.890> even<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.940> not<00:00:54.239> even

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
bicycle and it doesn't even is not even

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.229 
bicycle and it doesn't even is not even
noticed<00:00:55.590> on<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.770> bicycle<00:00:56.250> yeah<00:00:56.760> that's

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
noticed on the bicycle yeah that's

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.660 
noticed on the bicycle yeah that's
that's<00:00:57.629> really<00:00:57.899> cool<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.680> it's<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:59.160> guess

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
that's really cool and it's I guess

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.819 
that's really cool and it's I guess
maybe<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.480> can<00:01:00.629> give<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.780> quick<00:01:01.050> background<00:01:01.260> on

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
maybe you can give a quick background on

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.039 
maybe you can give a quick background on
on<00:01:02.070> how<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.670> wheel<00:01:02.910> started<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.510> how<00:01:03.600> flat<00:01:03.840> I

also like the other side I like

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.289 
also like the other side I like
technology<00:01:16.470> because<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.340> felt<00:01:17.640> like<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:18.090> know

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
technology because I felt like I know

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.120 
technology because I felt like I know
want<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.659> make<00:01:18.750> something<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:19.680> makes

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
want to make something that this makes

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.880 
want to make something that this makes
bikes<00:01:20.850> more<00:01:21.119> smarter<00:01:21.570> so<00:01:22.140> we<00:01:22.320> were<00:01:22.439> starting

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
bikes more smarter so we were starting

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.310 
bikes more smarter so we were starting
looking<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.909> working<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.600> then<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:24.960> just

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
looking to it working and then I just

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.960 
looking to it working and then I just
came<00:01:25.500> with<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:25.799> idea<00:01:26.100> for<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.400> smart<00:01:26.729> wheel

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
came with this idea for a smart wheel

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.880 
came with this idea for a smart wheel
and<00:01:27.330> we<00:01:27.570> start<00:01:27.810> developing<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.500> then<00:01:28.710> we<00:01:28.770> went

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
and we start developing and then we went

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.910 
and we start developing and then we went
on<00:01:29.040> Kickstarter<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:29.909> after<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.450> Kickstarter

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
on Kickstarter and after the Kickstarter

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.890 
on Kickstarter and after the Kickstarter
it<00:01:31.920> was<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.100> success<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.090> it's<00:01:33.210> like<00:01:33.329> okay<00:01:33.630> we

2013 and we promised our backers that we
will<00:01:52.800> deliver<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.370> smart<00:01:53.670> wheels<00:01:53.940> in<00:01:54.150> May

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
will deliver the smart wheels in May

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.280 
will deliver the smart wheels in May
2014<00:01:55.250> but<00:01:56.250> what<00:01:56.490> we<00:01:56.700> did<00:01:56.909> during<00:01:57.570> this<00:01:57.840> time<00:01:58.080> we

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
2014 but what we did during this time we

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.070 
2014 but what we did during this time we
redesign<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.400> completely<00:01:59.760> change<00:02:00.690> the<00:02:00.930> new

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
redesign and completely change the new

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.020 
redesign and completely change the new
smart<00:02:01.380> bill<00:02:01.560> which<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:01.860> much<00:02:02.070> more<00:02:02.370> better<00:02:02.670> and

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
smart bill which is much more better and

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.050 
smart bill which is much more better and
and<00:02:03.750> more<00:02:04.170> efficient<00:02:04.650> and<00:02:04.830> I<00:02:05.190> feel<00:02:05.700> like<00:02:05.880> it

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
and more efficient and I feel like it

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.410 
and more efficient and I feel like it
also<00:02:06.450> looks<00:02:06.750> better<00:02:06.930> yeah<00:02:07.320> so<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.250> we<00:02:08.970> had<00:02:09.270> to

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
also looks better yeah so and we had to

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.850 
also looks better yeah so and we had to
because<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:09.990> we<00:02:10.170> had<00:02:10.320> to<00:02:10.350> delay<00:02:10.679> the

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
because of that we had to delay the

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.220 
because of that we had to delay the
delivery<00:02:11.070> so<00:02:11.520> now<00:02:11.670> instead<00:02:11.850> of<00:02:12.030> May<00:02:12.270> 2014<00:02:12.930> will

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
delivery so now instead of May 2014 will

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.130 
delivery so now instead of May 2014 will
be<00:02:13.320> September<00:02:13.530> 2014<00:02:14.430> so<00:02:14.760> in<00:02:15.330> my<00:02:15.450> opinion<00:02:15.600> just

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
be September 2014 so in my opinion just

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.920 
be September 2014 so in my opinion just
few<00:02:16.980> months<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.610> delay<00:02:17.880> but<00:02:18.390> what<00:02:18.720> you're

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
few months the delay but what you're

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.930 
few months the delay but what you're
getting<00:02:19.140> is<00:02:19.440> much<00:02:19.709> sir<00:02:20.100> and<00:02:20.280> it's<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:20.700> first

getting is much sir and it's the first
it's<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.390> first<00:02:21.600> project<00:02:21.810> that<00:02:22.320> you<00:02:22.620> that

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
it's the first project that you that

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.199 
it's the first project that you that
you've<00:02:23.010> done<00:02:23.160> like<00:02:23.370> this<00:02:23.580> and<00:02:23.820> so<00:02:23.940> you<00:02:23.970> know

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
you've done like this and so you know

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.490 
you've done like this and so you know
there<00:02:24.450> are<00:02:24.600> there<00:02:24.870> are<00:02:24.930> issues<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.290> work

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
there are there are issues to work

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.380 
there are there are issues to work
through<00:02:25.709> but<00:02:25.800> the<00:02:25.950> fact<00:02:26.130> that<00:02:26.220> you've<00:02:26.459> you're

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
through but the fact that you've you're

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.750 
through but the fact that you've you're
not<00:02:27.540> only<00:02:27.720> you<00:02:28.350> know<00:02:28.380> overcoming<00:02:29.160> any<00:02:29.280> issues

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
not only you know overcoming any issues

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.280 
not only you know overcoming any issues
but<00:02:29.970> you're<00:02:30.090> also<00:02:30.239> taking<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:31.110> next

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
but you're also taking it to the next

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.290 
but you're also taking it to the next
level<00:02:31.410> so<00:02:32.040> let<00:02:32.250> me<00:02:32.370> hit<00:02:32.489> the<00:02:32.640> specs<00:02:32.910> that<00:02:33.180> you

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
level so let me hit the specs that you

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.880 
level so let me hit the specs that you
would<00:02:33.420> use<00:02:33.600> shared<00:02:33.959> with<00:02:34.110> me<00:02:34.260> so<00:02:34.440> you<00:02:34.500> said<00:02:34.770> the

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
would use shared with me so you said the

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.979 
would use shared with me so you said the
older<00:02:35.190> one<00:02:35.340> was<00:02:35.370> nine<00:02:35.730> pounds<00:02:36.300> it<00:02:36.570> was<00:02:36.750> much

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
older one was nine pounds it was much

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:48.250 
older one was nine pounds it was much
wider<00:02:37.910> it's<00:02:38.910> like<00:02:39.030> a<00:02:39.060> pizza<00:02:44.660> and<00:02:45.660> lighter<00:02:46.019> okay

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
wider it's like a pizza and lighter okay

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.380 
wider it's like a pizza and lighter okay
almost<00:02:49.260> bikes<00:02:49.739> so<00:02:50.430> what<00:02:50.610> you<00:02:50.730> do<00:02:50.850> you<00:02:50.970> just<00:02:51.000> get

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
almost bikes so what you do you just get

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.210 
almost bikes so what you do you just get
the<00:02:51.510> smart<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:51.900> wheel<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:52.470> then<00:02:52.860> you<00:02:53.010> have

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
the smart the wheel and then you have

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.830 
the smart the wheel and then you have
your<00:02:53.340> own<00:02:53.400> bicycle<00:02:53.640> you<00:02:54.120> take<00:02:54.330> off<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.690> wheel

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
your own bicycle you take off the wheel

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.400 
your own bicycle you take off the wheel
and<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:55.110> put<00:02:55.320> our<00:02:55.470> wheel<00:02:55.709> on<00:02:55.890> okay<00:02:56.370> that's<00:02:56.700> it

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.470 

it<00:03:01.410> can<00:03:01.650> replace<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.370> single<00:03:02.670> speed<00:03:03.030> or<00:03:03.239> the

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
it can replace the single speed or the

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.960 
it can replace the single speed or the
multi<00:03:03.810> gear<00:03:04.019> speed<00:03:04.290> bikes<00:03:04.650> but<00:03:05.310> what<00:03:05.579> happens

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
multi gear speed bikes but what happens

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.670 
multi gear speed bikes but what happens
whenever<00:03:06.180> you<00:03:06.480> put<00:03:06.720> a<00:03:06.750> smart<00:03:07.110> wheel<00:03:07.350> on<00:03:07.500> it

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
whenever you put a smart wheel on it

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.770 
whenever you put a smart wheel on it
becomes<00:03:08.010> a<00:03:08.160> single<00:03:08.370> speed<00:03:08.760> again<00:03:09.390> because<00:03:09.630> you

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
becomes a single speed again because you

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.130 
becomes a single speed again because you
cannot<00:03:10.049> put<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.500> gears<00:03:10.769> on<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.540> smart<00:03:12.540> yeah

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
cannot put the gears on the smart yeah

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.870 
cannot put the gears on the smart yeah
so<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.530> way<00:03:13.680> it<00:03:13.799> works<00:03:13.829> whenever<00:03:14.459> you<00:03:14.670> start

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
so the way it works whenever you start

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.569 
so the way it works whenever you start
pedaling<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.810> motor<00:03:15.989> turns<00:03:16.110> on<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:16.769> if<00:03:17.459> you

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
pedaling the motor turns on and if you

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.490 
pedaling the motor turns on and if you
want<00:03:17.760> to<00:03:17.910> stop<00:03:18.180> you<00:03:18.600> just<00:03:18.630> start<00:03:19.019> pedaling

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
want to stop you just start pedaling

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.920 
want to stop you just start pedaling
backwards<00:03:19.549> right<00:03:20.549> it<00:03:20.880> kind<00:03:21.120> of<00:03:21.180> does<00:03:21.420> a<00:03:21.450> regen

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
backwards right it kind of does a regen

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.900 
backwards right it kind of does a regen
thing<00:03:22.230> yeah<00:03:22.769> whenever<00:03:23.370> you're<00:03:23.549> pedaling

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
thing yeah whenever you're pedaling

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:24.440 
thing yeah whenever you're pedaling
backwards

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
backwards

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.229 
backwards
it's<00:03:24.900> a<00:03:25.370> regenerating<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.400> energy<00:03:26.850> or<00:03:27.060> if

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
it's a regenerating the energy or if

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.240 
it's a regenerating the energy or if
you're<00:03:27.420> going<00:03:27.630> down<00:03:27.780> pillows<00:03:28.230> so<00:03:28.650> this<00:03:29.100> way

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
you're going down pillows so this way

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.770 
you're going down pillows so this way
you<00:03:29.340> can<00:03:29.489> also<00:03:29.670> extend<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.299> range<00:03:30.480> a<00:03:30.660> little

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
you can also extend the range a little

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.199 
you can also extend the range a little
bit<00:03:31.019> and<00:03:31.170> arrange<00:03:31.829> for<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.160> flight<00:03:32.970> light

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
bit and arrange for the flight light

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.860 
bit and arrange for the flight light
smart<00:03:33.480> wheel<00:03:33.690> is<00:03:34.310> around<00:03:35.310> 30<00:03:35.700> miles<00:03:35.970> yeah<00:03:36.480> and

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
smart wheel is around 30 miles yeah and

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.319 
smart wheel is around 30 miles yeah and
but<00:03:37.739> whenever<00:03:38.010> you<00:03:38.310> stop<00:03:38.610> whenever<00:03:39.000> it's

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
but whenever you stop whenever it's

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.199 
but whenever you stop whenever it's
empty<00:03:40.170> you<00:03:40.410> just<00:03:40.769> you<00:03:41.370> can<00:03:41.519> just<00:03:41.700> plug<00:03:41.880> it<00:03:42.060> into

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
empty you just you can just plug it into

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.440 
empty you just you can just plug it into
the<00:03:42.420> wall<00:03:42.450> and<00:03:43.079> here<00:03:43.440> it's<00:03:44.430> charging<00:03:44.820> 2<00:03:45.120> to<00:03:45.269> 3

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
the wall and here it's charging 2 to 3

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.550 
the wall and here it's charging 2 to 3
hours<00:03:45.480> 2<00:03:45.989> to<00:03:46.079> 3<00:03:46.260> hours

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
hours 2 to 3 hours

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.770 
hours 2 to 3 hours
ok<00:03:47.040> yeah<00:03:47.610> you<00:03:47.850> mentioned<00:03:48.209> that<00:03:48.299> it's<00:03:48.450> so<00:03:48.630> it's

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
ok yeah you mentioned that it's so it's

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.750 
ok yeah you mentioned that it's so it's
like<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.230> batteries<00:03:50.070> in<00:03:50.220> here<00:03:50.250> are<00:03:50.549> lithium

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
like the batteries in here are lithium

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.880 
like the batteries in here are lithium
batteries<00:03:51.420> and<00:03:51.690> they're<00:03:51.810> sort<00:03:52.049> of<00:03:52.140> positioned

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
batteries and they're sort of positioned

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.650 
batteries and they're sort of positioned
around<00:03:52.980> the<00:03:53.220> motor<00:03:53.489> and<00:03:53.760> it's<00:03:54.299> something<00:03:54.540> like

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
around the motor and it's something like

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.800 
around the motor and it's something like
30<00:03:54.989> volts<00:03:55.530> and<00:03:55.680> 6<00:03:55.950> amp<00:03:56.130> hours<00:03:56.430> yes<00:03:57.150> so<00:03:57.540> the

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
30 volts and 6 amp hours yes so the

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:58.880 
30 volts and 6 amp hours yes so the
batteries<00:03:58.260> are<00:03:58.440> did<00:03:58.590> you

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
batteries are did you

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.559 
batteries are did you
it's<00:03:59.390> six<00:04:00.390> empowers<00:04:00.990> and<00:04:01.350> 30<00:04:02.220> volt<00:04:02.490> and<00:04:02.730> yeah

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
it's six empowers and 30 volt and yeah

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.230 
it's six empowers and 30 volt and yeah
it<00:04:03.660> gives<00:04:03.900> you<00:04:03.990> 30<00:04:04.230> miles<00:04:04.470> range<00:04:05.220> also<00:04:05.670> inside

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:06.240 
it gives you 30 miles range also inside

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.210 
it gives you 30 miles range also inside
here<00:04:06.510> we<00:04:06.630> have<00:04:06.660> the<00:04:06.900> motor<00:04:07.110> right<00:04:07.709> here<00:04:08.069> and

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
here we have the motor right here and

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.920 
here we have the motor right here and
then<00:04:08.490> the<00:04:08.610> batteries<00:04:09.060> around<00:04:09.240> and<00:04:09.690> old

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
then the batteries around and old

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.870 
then the batteries around and old
electronics<00:04:10.650> so<00:04:11.069> it's<00:04:11.190> all-in-one<00:04:11.700> design

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
no DJ shrimps come through the regular

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.450 
no DJ shrimps come through the regular
rim<00:04:32.460> of<00:04:33.090> course<00:04:33.330> if<00:04:33.510> there's<00:04:33.960> you<00:04:34.620> always<00:04:35.190> can

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
rim of course if there's you always can

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.760 
rim of course if there's you always can
replace<00:04:36.300> you<00:04:36.600> the<00:04:36.810> rim<00:04:36.960> with<00:04:37.169> the<00:04:37.320> one<00:04:37.590> that

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
replace you the rim with the one that

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.100 
replace you the rim with the one that
you<00:04:37.919> want<00:04:38.160> or<00:04:38.430> the<00:04:38.850> tire<00:04:39.120> the<00:04:39.419> one<00:04:39.570> we<00:04:39.750> did<00:04:39.900> you

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
you want or the tire the one we did you

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.560 
you want or the tire the one we did you
want<00:04:40.350> but<00:04:40.860> the<00:04:41.310> smart<00:04:41.640> field<00:04:41.880> originally

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
want but the smart field originally

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.900 
want but the smart field originally
comes<00:04:42.840> with<00:04:43.110> a<00:04:43.230> regular<00:04:43.650> tire<00:04:43.980> and<00:04:44.730> the

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
comes with a regular tire and the

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.480 
comes with a regular tire and the
regular<00:04:45.300> ring<00:04:45.990> and<00:04:46.380> I<00:04:46.590> noticed<00:04:46.919> on<00:04:47.040> this<00:04:47.190> bike

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
regular ring and I noticed on this bike

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:48.770 
regular ring and I noticed on this bike
you've<00:04:47.700> got<00:04:47.880> a<00:04:47.910> front<00:04:48.150> brake<00:04:48.330> but<00:04:48.630> you're

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
you've got a front brake but you're

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.480 
you've got a front brake but you're
using<00:04:48.990> that<00:04:49.200> pedal<00:04:49.560> backwards<00:04:49.740> for<00:04:50.250> the<00:04:50.280> rear

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
using that pedal backwards for the rear

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.700 
using that pedal backwards for the rear
so<00:04:50.850> you<00:04:51.300> know<00:04:51.419> disc<00:04:51.900> brakes<00:04:52.169> it<00:04:52.380> looks<00:04:52.560> like

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
so you know disc brakes it looks like

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.409 
so you know disc brakes it looks like
maybe<00:04:52.860> they<00:04:53.070> wouldn't<00:04:53.340> fit<00:04:53.580> on<00:04:53.610> this<00:04:53.940> at<00:04:54.270> least

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
maybe they wouldn't fit on this at least

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.470 
maybe they wouldn't fit on this at least
the<00:04:54.600> first<00:04:54.840> version<00:04:55.760> like<00:04:56.760> a<00:04:56.940> smart<00:04:57.270> wheel

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
the first version like a smart wheel

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.500 
the first version like a smart wheel
does<00:04:57.720> not<00:04:57.900> support<00:04:58.620> these<00:04:58.950> brakes<00:04:59.280> and<00:04:59.820> also

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
does not support these brakes and also

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.810 
does not support these brakes and also
there's<00:05:00.780> a<00:05:00.870> law<00:05:01.500> and<00:05:01.710> also<00:05:01.980> we<00:05:02.100> suggest<00:05:02.550> that

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
there's a law and also we suggest that

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.120 
there's a law and also we suggest that
because<00:05:03.479> smart<00:05:03.810> you<00:05:04.080> does<00:05:04.530> have<00:05:04.800> a<00:05:04.830> motor

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
because smart you does have a motor

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.620 
because smart you does have a motor
brake<00:05:05.490> so<00:05:05.790> whenever<00:05:05.970> you<00:05:06.210> start<00:05:06.419> pedaling

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
brake so whenever you start pedaling

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.350 
brake so whenever you start pedaling
yeah<00:05:07.169> the<00:05:07.410> more<00:05:07.560> backwards<00:05:08.550> the<00:05:08.729> motor<00:05:08.910> starts

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
yeah the more backwards the motor starts

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:15.650 
yeah the more backwards the motor starts
talking<00:05:09.720> oh<00:05:14.390> cool

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
talking oh cool

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.650 
talking oh cool
yeah<00:05:15.840> but<00:05:16.080> it's<00:05:16.530> a<00:05:16.740> this<00:05:17.070> is<00:05:17.390> electric<00:05:18.390> motor

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
yeah but it's a this is electric motor

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.110 
yeah but it's a this is electric motor
electric

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
electric

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.110 
electric
right<00:05:20.750> so<00:05:21.350> by<00:05:21.680> the<00:05:21.740> law<00:05:22.010> and<00:05:22.250> also<00:05:22.400> we<00:05:22.669> suggest

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
right so by the law and also we suggest

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.420 
right so by the law and also we suggest
that<00:05:23.210> you<00:05:23.330> at<00:05:23.570> least<00:05:23.600> have<00:05:23.870> one<00:05:24.160> manual<00:05:25.160> break

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
that you at least have one manual break
