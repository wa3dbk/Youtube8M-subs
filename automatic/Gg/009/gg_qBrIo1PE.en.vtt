different all over the world for example
if<00:00:28.289> we<00:00:28.439> take<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.800> texture<00:00:29.220> in<00:00:29.429> some<00:00:30.090> areas

however<00:00:56.030> very<00:00:56.300> difficult<00:00:57.019> to<00:00:57.140> define<00:00:57.469> which

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
however very difficult to define which

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.250 
however very difficult to define which
is<00:00:57.980> why<00:00:58.129> we<00:00:58.339> have<00:00:58.489> a<00:00:58.519> tasting<00:00:59.120> panel<00:00:59.300> able<00:01:00.110> to

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
is why we have a tasting panel able to

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.229 
is why we have a tasting panel able to
do<00:01:00.409> so<00:01:00.620> and<00:01:00.860> find<00:01:01.489> that<00:01:01.670> delicate<00:01:02.210> balance

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
do so and find that delicate balance

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.710
