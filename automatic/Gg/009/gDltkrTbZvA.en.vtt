00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.720 

I've<00:00:01.350> never<00:00:01.530> seen<00:00:01.770> this<00:00:01.920> before<00:00:02.129> so<00:00:02.340> I<00:00:02.520> thought

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
I've never seen this before so I thought

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:10.220 
I've never seen this before so I thought
I'd<00:00:02.909> show<00:00:03.090> everybody<00:00:08.780> so<00:00:09.780> you<00:00:09.900> may<00:00:10.019> notice

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
I'd show everybody so you may notice

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.530 
I'd show everybody so you may notice
it's<00:00:10.559> awfully<00:00:10.920> crunchy<00:00:11.759> when<00:00:12.059> I<00:00:12.120> turn<00:00:12.389> the

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
it's awfully crunchy when I turn the

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.860 
it's awfully crunchy when I turn the
rear<00:00:12.719> wheel<00:00:14.179> the<00:00:15.179> other<00:00:15.210> thing<00:00:15.570> you<00:00:15.690> should<00:00:15.719> be

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
rear wheel the other thing you should be

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.519 
rear wheel the other thing you should be
noticing<00:00:16.490> is<00:00:17.490> that<00:00:18.210> normally<00:00:19.109> this<00:00:19.230> clutch

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
noticing is that normally this clutch

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.890 
noticing is that normally this clutch
bail<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.789> primary<00:00:21.180> drive<00:00:21.390> shaft<00:00:21.689> here

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
bail and the primary drive shaft here

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.870 
bail and the primary drive shaft here
are<00:00:22.680> tied<00:00:22.859> together<00:00:23.039> obviously<00:00:23.730> in<00:00:23.820> the

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
are tied together obviously in the

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.400 
are tied together obviously in the
gearbox<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.570> they<00:00:24.630> would<00:00:24.779> always<00:00:24.900> turn<00:00:25.260> this

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
gearbox and they would always turn this

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.170 
gearbox and they would always turn this
wheel<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:25.859> if<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.010> move<00:00:26.220> this<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:27.060> should

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
wheel so if you move this this should

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.720 
wheel so if you move this this should
move<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.570> vice<00:00:27.689> versa

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
move and vice versa

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.980 
move and vice versa
see<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:29.760> can<00:00:29.939> throw<00:00:30.090> them<00:00:30.210> totally<00:00:30.539> independent

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
see I can throw them totally independent

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.880 
see I can throw them totally independent
of<00:00:31.019> each<00:00:31.140> other<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:33.469> something's<00:00:34.469> messed<00:00:34.710> up

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
of each other so something's messed up

00:00:34.890 --> 00:02:17.369 
of each other so something's messed up
in<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.070> gearbox

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.020 

before<00:02:18.379> I<00:02:18.410> started<00:02:18.830> disassembly<00:02:19.489> I<00:02:19.519> realized

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
before I started disassembly I realized

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.650 
before I started disassembly I realized
something

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
something

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.100 
something
I<00:02:21.129> just<00:02:22.129> serviced<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:23.269> gearbox<00:02:23.750> here

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
I just serviced the gearbox here

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.220 
I just serviced the gearbox here
actually<00:02:24.500> replaced<00:02:25.010> this<00:02:25.190> bearing<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:26.230> I

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
actually replaced this bearing and I

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.320 
actually replaced this bearing and I
totally<00:02:27.500> forgot<00:02:28.040> to<00:02:28.250> put<00:02:28.489> gear<00:02:28.700> oil<00:02:28.970> in<00:02:29.090> this

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
totally forgot to put gear oil in this

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.300 
totally forgot to put gear oil in this
so<00:02:29.780> I<00:02:29.810> suppose<00:02:30.349> we're<00:02:30.680> about<00:02:30.860> to<00:02:31.010> find<00:02:31.190> out

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
so I suppose we're about to find out

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.530 
so I suppose we're about to find out
just<00:02:31.370> how<00:02:31.760> important<00:02:32.269> gear<00:02:32.480> oil<00:02:32.720> actually<00:02:32.989> is

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
just how important gear oil actually is

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.699 
just how important gear oil actually is
before<00:02:35.540> it's<00:02:35.660> even<00:02:35.750> a<00:02:35.930> part<00:02:36.170> is<00:02:36.349> the<00:02:36.500> first

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
before it's even a part is the first

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.089 
before it's even a part is the first
thing<00:02:36.890> you<00:02:37.040> can<00:02:37.069> notice<00:02:38.290> this<00:02:39.290> primary<00:02:39.799> drive

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
thing you can notice this primary drive

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:41.770 
thing you can notice this primary drive
shaft<00:02:40.430> down<00:02:40.670> here<00:02:40.940> where<00:02:41.120> it<00:02:41.239> goes<00:02:41.390> into<00:02:41.629> the

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
shaft down here where it goes into the

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.140 
shaft down here where it goes into the
gearbox<00:02:41.989> has<00:02:42.830> turned<00:02:43.190> blue<00:02:43.459> and<00:02:43.489> purple<00:02:43.880> and

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
gearbox has turned blue and purple and

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.059 
gearbox has turned blue and purple and
brown<00:02:44.329> it's<00:02:44.690> totally<00:02:45.200> discolored<00:02:45.709> from<00:02:45.860> heat

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
brown it's totally discolored from heat

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.500 
brown it's totally discolored from heat
on<00:02:46.940> the<00:02:47.239> gearbox<00:02:47.450> side<00:02:47.959> there<00:02:49.120> I've<00:02:50.120> got<00:02:50.390> all

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
on the gearbox side there I've got all

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.089 
on the gearbox side there I've got all
the<00:02:50.630> bolts<00:02:50.870> out<00:02:50.989> so<00:02:51.200> let's<00:02:51.410> see<00:02:51.560> just<00:02:51.769> how<00:02:51.890> bad

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
the bolts out so let's see just how bad

00:02:52.099 --> 00:03:00.759 
the bolts out so let's see just how bad
this<00:02:52.310> is<00:02:52.579> oh<00:02:56.829> sure<00:02:59.079> I'll<00:03:00.079> start<00:03:00.410> here<00:03:00.590> with

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
this is oh sure I'll start here with

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.309 
this is oh sure I'll start here with
this<00:03:00.920> gearbox<00:03:01.190> cover<00:03:01.900> first<00:03:02.900> thing<00:03:03.140> that's

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
this gearbox cover first thing that's

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.479 
this gearbox cover first thing that's
obvious<00:03:03.470> is<00:03:04.010> I<00:03:04.549> just<00:03:04.610> have<00:03:04.910> chunks<00:03:05.299> of<00:03:05.420> metal

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
obvious is I just have chunks of metal

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.520 
obvious is I just have chunks of metal
basically<00:03:07.489> splines<00:03:07.879> or<00:03:08.150> teeth<00:03:08.379> sitting<00:03:09.379> in

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
basically splines or teeth sitting in

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.699 
basically splines or teeth sitting in
the<00:03:09.739> gearbox<00:03:10.549> and<00:03:11.150> what<00:03:12.019> little<00:03:12.290> bit<00:03:12.470> of<00:03:12.530> oil

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
the gearbox and what little bit of oil

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.500 
the gearbox and what little bit of oil
residue<00:03:13.220> I<00:03:13.250> guess<00:03:13.549> was<00:03:13.730> left<00:03:13.970> on<00:03:14.120> the<00:03:14.180> gears

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
residue I guess was left on the gears

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.530 
residue I guess was left on the gears
before<00:03:15.700> one<00:03:16.700> thing<00:03:16.880> you<00:03:16.970> can't<00:03:17.180> get<00:03:17.299> on<00:03:17.420> the

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
before one thing you can't get on the

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.449 
before one thing you can't get on the
video<00:03:17.780> is<00:03:17.989> that<00:03:18.139> it<00:03:18.260> really<00:03:18.560> stinks<00:03:18.859> if<00:03:19.340> you

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
video is that it really stinks if you

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.220 
video is that it really stinks if you
think<00:03:19.670> gear<00:03:19.850> oil<00:03:20.090> smells<00:03:20.359> bad<00:03:20.569> I<00:03:20.600> guess<00:03:20.930> try

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
think gear oil smells bad I guess try

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.379 
think gear oil smells bad I guess try
burning<00:03:22.010> it<00:03:22.100> up<00:03:22.190> as<00:03:22.370> bad<00:03:22.549> as<00:03:22.700> I<00:03:22.819> just<00:03:23.000> did<00:03:23.209> and

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:23.389 
burning it up as bad as I just did and

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:27.430 
burning it up as bad as I just did and
then<00:03:23.510> smell<00:03:23.780> it<00:03:24.220> so<00:03:25.930> let's<00:03:26.930> see<00:03:27.019> if<00:03:27.139> I<00:03:27.200> can<00:03:27.319> even

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
then smell it so let's see if I can even

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:34.330 
then smell it so let's see if I can even
get<00:03:27.650> these<00:03:27.769> out<00:03:28.010> of<00:03:28.040> here<00:03:33.010> so<00:03:34.010> here's<00:03:34.220> the

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
get these out of here so here's the

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.650 
get these out of here so here's the
intermediate<00:03:34.849> gear<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:35.180> counter<00:03:35.480> shaft

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
intermediate gear the counter shaft

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.589 
intermediate gear the counter shaft
whatever

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
whatever

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.589 
whatever
hopefully<00:03:38.290> you<00:03:38.349> can<00:03:38.469> see<00:03:38.709> I've<00:03:39.640> got<00:03:39.790> chunks<00:03:40.420> of

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599 
hopefully you can see I've got chunks of

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:43.530 
hopefully you can see I've got chunks of
the<00:03:41.140> other<00:03:41.349> gear<00:03:41.999> basically<00:03:42.999> stuck<00:03:43.299> in

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
the other gear basically stuck in

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.690 
the other gear basically stuck in
between<00:03:43.780> the<00:03:44.499> splines<00:03:44.859> or<00:03:45.129> teeth<00:03:45.310> on<00:03:45.519> this

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
between the splines or teeth on this

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.479 
between the splines or teeth on this
gear<00:03:45.760> and<00:03:46.269> it's<00:03:47.230> all<00:03:47.349> just<00:03:47.379> coated<00:03:48.189> with<00:03:48.370> us

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
gear and it's all just coated with us

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.020 
gear and it's all just coated with us
burn<00:03:49.239> up<00:03:49.450> I<00:03:49.569> guess<00:03:49.749> oil<00:03:50.049> residue<00:03:50.469> or<00:03:50.620> whatever

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
burn up I guess oil residue or whatever

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.490 
burn up I guess oil residue or whatever
metal<00:03:52.030> dust<00:03:54.420> everything<00:03:55.420> feels<00:03:55.689> very<00:03:55.780> jagged

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
metal dust everything feels very jagged

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.250 
metal dust everything feels very jagged
and<00:03:56.620> rough<00:03:58.439> this<00:03:59.439> one<00:04:01.019> actually<00:04:02.019> seems

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260

going<00:04:04.599> to<00:04:04.689> reuse<00:04:04.840> it<00:04:05.230> but<00:04:05.349> it<00:04:05.500> doesn't<00:04:05.650> seem

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
going to reuse it but it doesn't seem

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:11.399 
going to reuse it but it doesn't seem
too<00:04:06.159> bad<00:04:06.189> just<00:04:06.639> looking<00:04:07.030> at<00:04:07.180> it<00:04:10.260> bottom<00:04:11.260> of<00:04:11.349> the

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:11.409 
too bad just looking at it bottom of the

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:13.830 
too bad just looking at it bottom of the
gearbox<00:04:11.620> again<00:04:12.129> just<00:04:12.639> tons<00:04:13.000> and<00:04:13.389> tons<00:04:13.419> of

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
gearbox again just tons and tons of

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:23.010 
gearbox again just tons and tons of
metal<00:04:14.019> in<00:04:14.230> here<00:04:21.330> and<00:04:22.330> then<00:04:22.599> when<00:04:22.780> you<00:04:22.840> get<00:04:22.960> up

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
metal in here and then when you get up

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.439 
metal in here and then when you get up
to<00:04:23.229> the<00:04:23.349> actual<00:04:23.770> primary<00:04:24.250> drive<00:04:24.729> shaft<00:04:25.060> here

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:25.449 
to the actual primary drive shaft here

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:27.810 
to the actual primary drive shaft here
I've<00:04:26.440> got<00:04:26.650> a<00:04:26.680> little<00:04:26.889> bit<00:04:27.130> of<00:04:27.220> the<00:04:27.280> teeth<00:04:27.490> left

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
I've got a little bit of the teeth left

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.900 
I've got a little bit of the teeth left
on<00:04:28.810> the<00:04:28.990> very<00:04:29.229> end<00:04:29.500> and<00:04:29.800> they're<00:04:30.490> fine<00:04:30.699> in

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
on the very end and they're fine in

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.969 
on the very end and they're fine in
there<00:04:31.120> so<00:04:32.020> you<00:04:32.080> can<00:04:32.199> see<00:04:32.380> where<00:04:32.560> it<00:04:32.650> actually

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
there so you can see where it actually

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:34.469 
there so you can see where it actually
made<00:04:33.220> it<00:04:33.340> up<00:04:33.460> with<00:04:33.669> the<00:04:33.759> other<00:04:33.910> gear

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
made it up with the other gear

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:38.460 
made it up with the other gear
it<00:04:34.690> is<00:04:34.990> totally<00:04:35.740> stripped<00:04:36.870> there's<00:04:37.870> nothing

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
it is totally stripped there's nothing

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:44.189 
it is totally stripped there's nothing
left<00:04:42.180> there's<00:04:43.180> one<00:04:43.419> more<00:04:43.599> look<00:04:43.780> at<00:04:43.900> the<00:04:43.960> drive

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 
left there's one more look at the drive

you've<00:05:02.050> ever<00:05:02.229> wondered<00:05:02.470> just<00:05:02.680> how<00:05:02.919> important

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
you've ever wondered just how important

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.149 
you've ever wondered just how important
gear<00:05:03.639> oil<00:05:03.849> is<00:05:04.060> I<00:05:04.560> think<00:05:05.560> there's<00:05:05.740> your<00:05:05.979> answer

00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:06.159 
gear oil is I think there's your answer

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:11.070 
gear oil is I think there's your answer
and<00:05:06.580> just<00:05:07.229> for<00:05:08.229> reference<00:05:08.259> I<00:05:08.919> had<00:05:09.370> made<00:05:09.550> it<00:05:10.080> 17

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
and just for reference I had made it 17

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.310 
and just for reference I had made it 17
almost<00:05:11.470> 17<00:05:11.860> miles<00:05:12.220> even<00:05:12.990> from<00:05:13.990> the<00:05:14.080> time<00:05:14.259> I

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
almost 17 miles even from the time I

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.170 
almost 17 miles even from the time I
serviced<00:05:15.130> it<00:05:15.250> and<00:05:15.400> apparently<00:05:15.699> forgot<00:05:16.030> to

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
serviced it and apparently forgot to

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.779 
serviced it and apparently forgot to
refill<00:05:16.330> it<00:05:16.539> with<00:05:16.690> gear<00:05:16.870> oil<00:05:17.130> until<00:05:18.130> I<00:05:18.190> totally

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:18.789 
refill it with gear oil until I totally

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:23.550 
refill it with gear oil until I totally
lost<00:05:19.750> my<00:05:20.020> gearing<00:05:20.620> as<00:05:20.740> you<00:05:20.860> see<00:05:21.039> here<00:05:22.169> so<00:05:23.169> make
