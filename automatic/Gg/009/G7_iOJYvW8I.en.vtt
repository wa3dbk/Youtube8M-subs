00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.480
 and this is the test drive to the model 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.509
 most spicy national at the moment the 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.000
 Fluence gt car besides 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.859
 his motorization of 180 horses 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.810
 characterized by a high level of 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.220
 equipment a lot of quality and a lot 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.260
 equipment especially in the field of 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.670
 security something very important for another 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.769
 something that should not fill with pride 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.769
 it's national industry let's handle it 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.380
 regarding the suspension diagram is 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.970
 this people flow far from being of these 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.830
 harsh rough suspensions of the 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.110
 supercars in which in the 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.820
 city on uneven floors is difficult 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.190
 circular with comfort are situations 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.860
 rather balanced enough 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.800
 comfortable for the city and en route has 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.410
 proved to be very stable and even with 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.390
 little noise in speed curves the 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.490
 engine is undoubtedly the strongest point of 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.380
 this flourishing not only for the power 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.060
 of 180 horses but also for its 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.940
 torque for the moment of greatest strength 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.020
 that throws it from 2200 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.430
 revolutions per minute which makes 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.190
 Besides, there are three hundred hundred 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.680
 meters are not many much is the force 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.050
 that has this engine and makes it go 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.300
 have a great capacity for recovery 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.680
 of speed that's very useful on the route 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.990
 at the time of for example having to pass 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.150
 a truck that goes to minors no longer does 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.040
 lack of walking doing recess or pulling 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.200
 changes of the car that by other parties 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.810
 they have very good levels of consumption is 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.850
 an extremely modern engine and the 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.460
 performance and consumption 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.009
 details of a high- tech engine 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.369
 the motorization is undoubtedly the most 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.680
 strong this flows 72 liters turbo 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.259
 has 180 horses but also in a 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.630
 torque of 300 minutes meters just two 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.460
 thousand 200 revolutions per minute this what 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.250
 that makes it have a great recovery 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.380
 of speed even when the engine is going to 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.619
 very low turns for example in this 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.170
 moment we are going in third to two 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.009
 thousand 200 revolutions per minute to 60 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.899
 kilometers per hour and a pressure 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.000
 accelerator and the vehicle goes out with 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.179
 a lot of strength with much more strength 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.219
 push 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.680
 another remarkable aspect of this 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:15.939
 motorization is the level of consumption what 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.239
 which also shows that it is a propellant 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:20.799
 high technology for example marching 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.349
 en route to 120 kilometers per hour 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:25.269
 constant the advantage you have of 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.420
 travel in each box of sixth is that a 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:30.689
 that engine speed goes only to 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:34.209
 2,500 revolutions per minute and consumes 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:36.099
 7.1 liters per 100 kilometers is 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.439
 difficult to find a direct rival to 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:40.329
 this flow in gt we told you that is the 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:41.910
 domestic production model more 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:44.250
 powerful 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.110
 a more similar rival would be the product 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.240
 408 that is also manufactured in the 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.980
 Argentina are the two more or less of the 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.200
 same generation two modern models 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:57.240
 but the product has 163 horses 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:59.610
 against 180 of this plugins the 0 308 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.740
 in its gti version if it has 200 horses 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.450
 more than this one but it's imported from 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.800
 europe and it's a five hatchback 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.040
 doors new partnership between bodies 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.040
 as 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.819
 the traits that distinguish this fluence 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.790
 that this respect of fluence 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:26.670
 conventional are the front spoilers 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.040
 and rear the rear spoiler the rims 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.920
 of 17 inches that give you that effect 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.989
 sports are color be tone and the 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.970
 identification that is in the part 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.280
 back together with the identification of 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.010
 renault sport remember that this car 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.700
 It is the first model approved by 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.410
 renaud sport 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.940
 manufactured outside France in the 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.100
 interior also has features that 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.980
 identify this club in people like 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.720
 leather upholstery with seams 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.080
 of red color that also appear in the 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.070
 headrest with identification gt 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.070
 identification this is also in the 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.480
 front panel the flyers and the 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.190
 gearshift also have the 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.870
 red stitching that give you that 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.510
 touch sportsmanship and the board 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.950
 distinctive because the speedometer is 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.450
 digital as well as the indicators of 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.450
 fuel and engine temperature 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.470
 regarding the active safety of a 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:20.019
 vehicle that serves to 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.459
 protect us while we are walking in 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.430
 the car at the time of the collision but 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:27.009
 to prevent it we believe that the 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.530
 power is a safety element is 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:31.570
 important to have push force 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.250
 of the engine how does this flow in gt by 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:37.479
 example when it comes to having to pass a 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:39.039
 vehicle on the road is interesting to see 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:42.009
 the power as an element of 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:44.139
 active safety but on the other hand this 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:45.610
 flow is well equipped with discs in the 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:49.990
 four wheel disc brakes on the 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:52.840
 four wheels with anti-lock abs and 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.789
 emergency braking assistance one 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.400
 thing that also has is that when one 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:59.320
 brakes and the car detects that braking 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.600
 it was emergency turn on 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.490
 automatically on the beacons has 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.020
 also electronic distribution of 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.750
 braking 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.419
 s &amp; p o stability and control control 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.729
 of traction with respect to safety 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.289
 passive that is what does protect us 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:16.509
 at the time that we had a 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:18.370
 accident when we touched the vehicle 

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:19.569
 comes with six airbags you have two 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.879
 front for driver 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:24.009
 front side passengers for 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:27.159
 driver and companion also and of 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:29.499
 curtain for the front occupants and 

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:31.599
 backs in addition to the equipment of 

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:34.209
 security that we mentioned before the 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:36.490
 fluence gt is very complete at level 

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:39.969
 equipment in every way for example 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:42.939
 brings electric sunroof a system of 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:44.979
 audio with double antenna with mp3 usb and 

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:47.319
 bluetooth automatic dual zone air conditioner 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:49.449
 with exits for the occupants of the 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:51.759
 rear seats sports seats 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:53.800
 leather hands- free cards for 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:57.669
 ignition and opening and closing of doors 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:59.259
 integrated district navigator sensor 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:01.059
 external luminosity for ignition 

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:02.199
 automatic rain sensor lights 

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:04.330
 for automatic ignition of 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:07.240
 headlight wipers fog 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:10.089
 Front backs plus xenon headlights 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.589
 with headlamp washers also folding 

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:13.059
 electronic rear view mirrors 

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:15.069
 that can also be sent 

00:06:13.059 --> 00:06:17.319
 electronically from the inside between 

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:19.839
 other things another of the great virtues 

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:21.849
 of fluence is its habitability with a 

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:23.580
 very good space for the occupants 

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:25.689
 rear can travel three adults 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:28.719
 comfortably in the rear seats 

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:33.330
 and a huge trunk a load capacity 

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:33.330
 of 530 decimeters fields 

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:40.309
 with that 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.729
 income 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:56.409
 good if we finish the test drive 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:07:00.219
 of this fluence this model that we can 

00:06:56.409 --> 00:07:02.229
 stand out for its quality for its level of 

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:03.939
 performance by a spectacular engine of 

00:07:02.229 --> 00:07:06.789
 very low consumption and very good performance 

00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:09.909
 of balanced suspensions in summary 

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:10.719
 a car is in price despite being 

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:12.909
 expensive 

00:07:10.719 --> 00:07:15.039
 with respect to its competitors and a 

00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:17.800
 very interesting purchase option for 

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:19.389
 who are looking for a sedan with good 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.889
 Cargo capacity of trunk with good 

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:24.449
 space for five occupants and also 

00:07:20.889 --> 00:07:24.449
 with an excellent transformation 

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:31.229
 let's go with the renault technical sheet 

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:33.000
 fluence gt and a gasoline engine 

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:34.530
