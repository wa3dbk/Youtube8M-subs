00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:04.740
 hi cybernaut you are in the course of 3d max 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.740
 created by video tutorials 

00:00:10.229 --> 00:00:12.429
 Now, look what, when you tell him to put 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:17.519
 an avalanche of these is extremely slow when putting a light of this type 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:19.409
 look in the window defend 

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:22.550
 It has not started sixty years ago 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.999
 so jealous can 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:26.789
 when you put a sunlight 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.619
 you have to say atrix to 3d max 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:30.359
 use 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.490
 a defend type specified 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.480
 we access you learn 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.230
 percent 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.230
 advanced lights you even have here 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.240
 3 this act 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.180
 simply what 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.180
 acesur der 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.540
 will go much faster in what will be the generation of these practices 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.760
 very well 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.810
 is already doing it and remember we have put 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.460
 a light 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.460
 i have activated the box 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.810
 once finished the render that stops or to record because it has taken a long time 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.340
 Once the render is finished you can check 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.340
 that lighting 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.210
 i also applied with him the and you think look at what that generates a light 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.360
 overhead 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.620
 without shadows too marked look and believe us 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.600
 a global lighting very a 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.880
 seen until promotion 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.710
 with shadows 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.470
 It creates an exterior lighting 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.160
 locate we have place 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.320
 exterior lighting 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.530
 perfect to what mosquera estilu mina 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:55.500
 A shadow 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.119
 main this would be 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.840
 fill lighting 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.840
 now what we have left is unique sport ' 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.630
 minimized this minimized the window in the and 3 remember that here we have not 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.799
 modified nothing 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.959
 we have simply practiced 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.900
 and now pamos to create a light I'm going to creation if we have used the sky 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.159
 now let's create 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:18.259
 one of these some tÃ¡riq 

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:20.139
 to generate to simulate 

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:20.889
 the South 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:22.929
 I stop here 

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:26.679
 we want it to come highlighted that so if the facade luminet well 

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:30.709
 there he selected and dragged 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.620
 very good now let's move 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.629
 this is little we have put 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:36.919
 let's move around here for example 

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:39.919
 over here and we're going to modify some parameters 

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:45.049
 in the lighting section and kike explaining that they are all these 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.010
 parameters but to start I'm interested in having shadows 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.849
 this is important 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:50.939
 very good i 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:52.159
 we will modify 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:55.159
 Overture side parameters of this look 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:59.829
 we will be modifying and learning how to use these parameters 

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:04.299
 throughout the course of three subjects that is doing 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.459
 very well we have already put 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.609
 we look at intensity to see which 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:12.609
 here 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:15.100
 and now let's go back to do 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.879
 another sing 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:20.329
 we come to the boxes up here on the right i ref 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:22.590
 who tells you what 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.620
 agree 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.339
 lucescu and exposing 

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:26.799
 latest 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.059
 we make pere 

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:32.019
 we had this render very well and now the other one will be generated 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.819
 see what albania lives a light a light 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.609
 from one side he has already created us perfectly the box office shadows has 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:45.789
 illuminated has cleared us all the area that here that we had been 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.759
 completely push cures for having at the beginning only 

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:51.079
 a light from above 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:54.079
 very good now what we have left villa 

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:56.409
 a tree here 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:59.420
 something here to cover everything is formed maybe enter 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.209
 the attention in the building that is what interests us 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:05.959
 which is simple that is 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.239
 put trees on three themes 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:10.890
 we meet here and we are again to the tab of 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.039
 creation 

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:15.159
 yes we have seen that 3d max be 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:17.229
 fully automated 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:22.460
 to create windows doors walls of stairs looks 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.210
 Well look 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.770
 here you have 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.229
 where we have seen 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:29.300
 the walls we also have look at this part of here 

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:33.169
 different types of a 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:34.470
 as you can see 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.670
 3d max is perfectly 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:37.620
 prepared 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.650
 to work in architecture 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.830
 we take anyone the one you like the most, keep in mind that you can modify 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.500
 anything about him 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.379
 for example 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:52.199
 a title we can here the intention is above all to cover this area well then 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:55.199
 morelia look over here mulino menudo pine 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:59.849
 Well, we're going to make it smaller around here. Look, it was modified and I do it 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:01.490
 plus 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:02.419
 to tie 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:04.040
 small little here 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.389
 the height 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:08.050
 down 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.969
 the intention remembers that it is 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:12.050
 in the cemetery 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.889
 hide all this recent way out 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:16.270
 what interests us 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.069
 choose 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:21.059
 this way, look, I'm going to move it, I'm going to remove some of the density 

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:22.949
 leaves 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:24.520
 Not that much 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.979
 tgp but look how is allowing us to modify anything is 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:34.170
 very interesting how well prepared it is more perfect and now we will move it 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.809
 in this text 

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:40.839
 very well what I was interested in was covering 

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:42.819
 all this overturn 

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:45.020
 and now as you can not see where the stem is 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.520
 I just put it 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.229
 what I wanted 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:51.719
 was to cover 

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:53.050
 when we have to do 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.219
 the front of him 

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:57.360
 all this area here that I had this way from here that I had left 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:05:59.189
 in conception 

00:05:59.189 --> 00:06:00.800
 very good and hours 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.949
 we could go 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:06.529
 modifying different parameters of the materials of the objects more 

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:08.129
 big with smaller 

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:09.990
 what interested me that she 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:15.560
 show you the preparations of this 3d max to be able to create facades in the 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.540
 next video tutorial teaches you I'll do acre until chadash postcard mind to 

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:22.669
 hand I sell you worry that this is a way 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:25.529
 to show you automated loa sta 

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:27.259
 perfect now yes 

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:28.990
 we select 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.990
 i rents 

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:38.379
 very good cybernaut and after a long wait doing the render 

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:41.159
 we have our final render 

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:43.619
 our definitive image 

00:06:43.619 --> 00:06:46.020
 in this one he requested tutorial ovidio demo 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.369
 whatever you want to call him 

00:06:47.369 --> 00:06:48.680
 we have seen how 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:53.840
 by means of tools automates the sce3 temax all these that we have here 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:54.729
 down 

00:06:54.729 --> 00:06:56.809
 we can create facades 

00:06:56.809 --> 00:06:59.469
 very fast really 

00:06:59.469 --> 00:07:00.559
 we can go 

00:07:00.559 --> 00:07:03.849
 very fast and any change 

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:06.849
 we can do it 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.659
 I hope you liked it and see you in the next chapter
