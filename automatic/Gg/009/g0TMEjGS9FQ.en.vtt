asked me what's the difference between a

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.340 
asked me what's the difference between a
ceramic<00:02:15.640> barrel<00:02:15.970> versus<00:02:16.420> a<00:02:16.450> titanium<00:02:16.870> barrel

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350

ceramic barrel versus a titanium barrel
in<00:02:17.500> terms<00:02:17.740> of<00:02:17.920> what<00:02:18.040> it<00:02:18.130> can<00:02:18.250> do<00:02:18.400> for<00:02:18.430> your<00:02:18.700> hair

and have you tried fold I can honestly

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.250 
and have you tried fold I can honestly
say<00:02:21.250> that<00:02:21.730> both<00:02:21.940> types<00:02:22.270> of<00:02:22.420> barrows<00:02:22.720> yields

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
say that both types of barrows yields

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.800 
say that both types of barrows yields
shiny<00:02:23.650> long-lasting<00:02:24.610> curls<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.510> only

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
shiny long-lasting curls the only

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.200 
shiny long-lasting curls the only
difference<00:02:26.200> is<00:02:26.440> a<00:02:26.740> titanium<00:02:27.130> barrel<00:02:27.490> is<00:02:27.760> much

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
difference is a titanium barrel is much

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.450 
difference is a titanium barrel is much
lighter<00:02:28.540> than<00:02:28.720> a<00:02:28.840> ceramic<00:02:29.290> barrel<00:02:29.590> so<00:02:30.100> if<00:02:30.280> your

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
lighter than a ceramic barrel so if your

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.370 
lighter than a ceramic barrel so if your
arms<00:02:30.790> get<00:02:30.970> easily<00:02:31.390> tired<00:02:31.630> from<00:02:31.870> holding<00:02:32.020> hot

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
arms get easily tired from holding hot

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.500 
arms get easily tired from holding hot
tools<00:02:32.650> then<00:02:33.190> I<00:02:33.220> highly<00:02:33.640> recommend<00:02:33.670> going<00:02:34.210> for

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
tools then I highly recommend going for

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.360 
tools then I highly recommend going for
the<00:02:34.600> titanium<00:02:34.930> barrel<00:02:35.440> because<00:02:35.680> it's<00:02:36.130> super

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
the titanium barrel because it's super

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.480 
the titanium barrel because it's super
lightweight<00:02:37.590> currently<00:02:38.590> Sephora<00:02:39.010> sells<00:02:39.340> the

ceramic version of this hair styler

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.630
