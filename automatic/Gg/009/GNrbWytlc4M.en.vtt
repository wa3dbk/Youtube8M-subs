00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.970
 I want to warn you in advance 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:28.450
 subsequent shots will cause you hellish 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.369
 bombing so guys if you are morally 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:34.180

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:37.300
 happen then we get down and start u 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.750
 Us guys standard tyazh go on one 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.660
 wing 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.510
 st on the other nothing really 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.100
 foreshadows trouble our devilostik takes 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.530
 key point to give 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.710
 clearance by enemy crazy lt who 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.620
 go to the center but panther 2 such 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.929
 does not recognize tactics and immediately begins 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.719
 push our nunity word this 

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:01.929
 lt must fly from my place 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:04.480
 shine on enemy base and mouth okay 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:06.690
 well let's happen at this time on 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:10.420
 where the flank went 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:14.890
 right they merge there and so we 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:19.240
 op op minus 2 tanks she c3 meanwhile 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:21.969
 us real street magic carpet just 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.240
 leaves for the unknown and returns 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:28.299
 from there already being shot like so 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.030
 happened to nobody understood if someone 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:33.189
 is he backing back in shock getting flops 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.439
 from each and everyone how do you think he is 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:37.990
 will live long right long in 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:43.630
 general he goes to the hangar and those 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:47.049
 the time we have but 9 who is to blame 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.939
 in this sink is our devil right 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.560
 because he took this position 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:54.039
 well at least panther think exactly 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.649
 so begins our firefly to disassemble 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:02:00.609
 he remains already there for opponents and 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.990
 now of course the offender is killing him 

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:04.119
 think will live long 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.880
 yes no of course as soon as he lit 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:10.420
 he flies away with overwhelming force 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:15.370
 I hope there in the hangar right brain and mind 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:17.650
 all this time top st 120 stood with us 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.170
 in the bushes and as soon as he got 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.610
 first spank he finally did 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.980
 stir and drove down 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.980
 the author of the plume sets fire to his bunch also 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.519
 how fired up my after watching this 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:35.080
 battlefield and 120 flies down at full steam even 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:38.140
 without putting out your fifth point 2 read the koran and 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.690
 flies in poor firefly think he 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.660
