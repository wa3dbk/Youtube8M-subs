00:00:00.649 --> 00:00:05.140
 in this first day of opening game hunt roger did not shoot he 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.220
 must say that the morning was already well advanced when we arrived in his 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:12.499
 his fight project is here at home in his area a preserved place 

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:15.900
 for generations the road 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.439
 home 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:18.689
 a barack obama 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:21.859
 how the side serviced with my dad 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:26.399
 our eldest received during an interview with the pana who without us would not exist 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:27.779
 the most that 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.970
 some parcels of land 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.210
 in Haiti 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.680
 so we have the time it does because the contributor become more scarce and 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.690
 o'dowd stone 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.450
 we will finally see back 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.960
 surface ducks sends shorebirds 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.670
 waterfowl does not come in numbers on the ten hectares of roger yet 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.220
 for today's hunt no longer has the taste of that of yesteryear an opening to 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.980
 August 21, however, nature lovers are an aberration 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.660
 emigration begins 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.290
 birds 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.780
 all are indeed we start again a parterre of friends 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.110
 so 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.729
 near the b-square 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:03.450
 we are limited 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.630
 that's a term for people with 25 coins 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.760
 12 hours to 12 hours 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.140
 you will not do me 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.720
 for him the extreme 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.740
 we must believe we can 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.850
 we talked about the internet has completely very tight does not allow 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.350
 more choice 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.860
 because his environment reminded him that at haute-savoie he will have more than one 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.540
 there will be no more birds either because the environments make that 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.980
 now 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.980
 as to our problems contrary to the examples 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.409
 only craftsman of our successes a good hunter with good assets 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.590
 I'm not going any boy duck 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.030
 tame 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.900
 of the federation that received an ovation 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.490
 help them 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.180
 we intend to resign 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.680
 to attract wild ducks in his struggle this project has almost all the 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.330
 comfort is there especially often leach of calmness and communion with nature 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.010
 if the screen to him are not televisual on his canvas he acts in 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.070
 movement 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.070
 the tribunal 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:14.039
 for me it is no 

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:16.009
 it's a relaxing place before 

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:17.999
 it's a great passion 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:21.259
 it's a love of the enemy place to a love of nature that 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:23.699
 e 

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:26.939
 we do not have to explain it that's how we are 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:30.069
 like that we fell into the galley when we were little a lot of 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.849
 Quebec 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.420
 besides next to the rifle and binoculars always and sometimes also a 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.489
 camera 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.999
 to immortalize the rarest species
