00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
there's little weed and 14 i'ma show you

there's little weed and 14 i'ma show you
a<00:00:21.060> pretty<00:00:21.480> incredible<00:00:21.660> engine<00:00:23.329> does<00:00:24.329> this<00:00:24.509> one

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
a pretty incredible engine does this one

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.030 
a pretty incredible engine does this one
runs<00:00:25.079> I<00:00:25.410> think<00:00:26.099> like<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.340> brand<00:00:26.730> new<00:00:27.000> engine

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.040 
runs I think like a brand new engine

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:34.690 
runs I think like a brand new engine
they're<00:00:29.040> zoomed<00:00:29.430> in<00:00:29.700> I'm<00:00:30.390> when<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.689> fired<00:00:31.020> up

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:43.069 

I'm<00:00:35.700> gonna<00:00:35.850> run<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.270> on<00:00:36.510> one<00:00:36.899> wick<00:00:42.079> cover

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
I'm gonna run this on one wick cover

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:54.910 
I'm gonna run this on one wick cover
this<00:00:43.350> one

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.200 

I've<00:00:55.920> already<00:00:56.070> got<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.370> water<00:00:56.550> boiling<00:00:56.670> so

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
I've already got the water boiling so

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.310 
I've already got the water boiling so
it's<00:00:57.329> just<00:00:57.510> going<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.690> take<00:00:57.839> a<00:00:57.870> second<00:00:58.289> and

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
it's just going to take a second and

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:19.010 
it's just going to take a second and
you'll<00:00:58.500> be<00:00:58.649> running

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.780 

it's<00:01:20.020> not<00:01:20.290> tells<00:01:20.619> you<00:01:20.799> the<00:01:20.920> boilers<00:01:21.369> hold<00:01:21.640> the

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
it's not tells you the boilers hold the

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.480 
it's not tells you the boilers hold the
pressure<00:01:22.060> really<00:01:22.720> well<00:01:23.080> and<00:01:23.740> also<00:01:23.979> tells<00:01:24.340> you

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
pressure really well and also tells you

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.140 
pressure really well and also tells you
that<00:01:24.549> the<00:01:24.759> motor<00:01:25.060> is<00:01:25.530> not<00:01:26.530> wore<00:01:26.799> out<00:01:27.150> because

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
that the motor is not wore out because

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.399 
that the motor is not wore out because
it's<00:01:28.330> running<00:01:28.570> like<00:01:28.860> very<00:01:29.860> little<00:01:30.220> steam

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
it's running like very little steam

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.230 
it's running like very little steam
actually<00:01:32.409> pick<00:01:33.399> it<00:01:33.549> up<00:01:33.670> and<00:01:33.820> move<00:01:33.939> pretty

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
actually pick it up and move pretty

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:46.370 
actually pick it up and move pretty
quick<00:01:35.340> one

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.580 

and<00:01:47.380> it'll<00:01:47.710> slow<00:01:47.979> rate<00:01:48.189> down<00:01:52.409> this<00:01:53.409> is

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
and it'll slow rate down this is

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.499 
and it'll slow rate down this is
probably<00:01:53.920> one<00:01:54.100> of<00:01:54.130> the<00:01:54.399> best<00:01:54.850> running

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
probably one of the best running

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.380 
probably one of the best running
Whedon's<00:01:56.500> I've<00:01:56.740> ever<00:01:57.130> come<00:01:57.460> across<00:01:57.789> and<00:01:58.210> I've

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
Whedon's I've ever come across and I've

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.660 
Whedon's I've ever come across and I've
had<00:01:58.630> a<00:01:58.929> lot<00:01:59.439> of<00:01:59.470> them<00:02:00.750> right<00:02:01.750> now<00:02:01.810> it<00:02:02.439> is<00:02:03.100> by<00:02:03.369> far

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
had a lot of them right now it is by far

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.429 
had a lot of them right now it is by far
the<00:02:03.700> best<00:02:04.030> rendering<00:02:04.270> engine<00:02:04.899> I<00:02:04.990> have<00:02:05.140> out<00:02:05.319> of

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
the best rendering engine I have out of

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:31.710 
the best rendering engine I have out of
twelve<00:02:05.770> weeds

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:58.949 

go<00:02:32.720> kick<00:02:33.020> their<00:02:33.140> open<00:02:38.710> that's<00:02:39.710> on<00:02:39.920> one

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.720 

and<00:02:59.379> then<00:02:59.590> when<00:02:59.799> you<00:02:59.920> pull<00:03:00.129> the<00:03:00.310> heat<00:03:00.489> source

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
and then when you pull the heat source

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:10.020 
and then when you pull the heat source
out<00:03:05.219> there's<00:03:06.219> the<00:03:06.459> one<00:03:06.670> wick<00:03:08.609> and<00:03:09.609> I'd<00:03:09.760> like<00:03:09.879> to

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
out there's the one wick and I'd like to

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.550 
out there's the one wick and I'd like to
see<00:03:10.209> how<00:03:10.359> long<00:03:10.599> an<00:03:10.750> engine<00:03:10.989> will<00:03:11.079> run<00:03:11.319> without

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
see how long an engine will run without

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.119 
see how long an engine will run without
any<00:03:12.340> heat<00:03:12.700> source<00:03:13.349> another<00:03:14.349> indicator<00:03:14.829> how

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
any heat source another indicator how

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:16.649 
any heat source another indicator how
well<00:03:15.340> you<00:03:15.430> play<00:03:15.670> with<00:03:15.909> labor<00:03:16.209> is<00:03:16.359> all<00:03:16.540> the

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:16.659 
well you play with labor is all the

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:40.750 
well you play with labor is all the
pressure

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:52.580 

that's<00:03:41.360> fine<00:03:41.720> little<00:03:42.170> weak

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.630 

and<00:03:52.920> it's<00:03:53.910> all<00:03:54.180> over
