00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 she will only be a short intro for today 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.450
 it should go to sport again and again 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.040
 Although you know about a weight training exercise 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.420
 yes I do strength training myself 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.650
 do not do that anymore in the gym 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.179
 I only do it now 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.980
 at home with a few exercises 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.289
 I actually use it as good as 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.260
 just my own body weight and also 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.119
 to act shortly and I want you 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.920
 just like that of my loved and 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.449
 The most effective exercises I show 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.189
 now very very regularly 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.570
 do and I really do very well 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.250
 find and yes you wanted that yes 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.500
 I really want to see you, I'll show you 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.450
 Today my favorite exercise for the army 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.860
 and the shoulders for the construction and for 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.050
 the legs are actually always 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.050
 that's what I'm training the most 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.399
 just do these bodies and that is 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.870
 now also quite a few exercises 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.910
 I show you I make the agile ones 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.680
 training is not all in line 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.870
 but I always look for each one 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.730
 partie for poor stomach and legs 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.399
 I'll get out of three exercises 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.129
 Repeat three times and be there 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.809
 I then about half way 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.160
 to three quarters of an hour a so would 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.480
 I give you as a tip a hot 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.309
 I want to do a few exercises 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.809
 then just find out who the 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.280
 you do not like all of you 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.380
 you are falcao to find the goethes 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.030
 but I just wanted the compact 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.500
 somehow pack in a video 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.659
 yes and I wish you a lot now 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.299
 enjoy everything you need 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.159
 your body then maybe one more 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.700
 mat around so the stomach exercises on it 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.439
 close 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.390
 and next to it a few dumbbells or 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.799
 water bottles or so then that is 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.369
 kilo number of course totally you 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.110
 leave 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.880
 mine are from Amazon now 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.170
 each three kilos dumb and so can 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.180
 I work quite well 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.560
 and yes I wish you a lot now 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.420
 fun with the video we find time with 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.650
 I do the arm exercises first 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.570
 then mostly like the 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.790
 classic bicep curls with those you 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.710
 your upper arm is always training there 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.240
 to pay attention to a nice straight posture 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.500
 and the legs could be a bit like that 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.729
 just provide one 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.729
 better standing have 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.560
 then I also find that very effective 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.780
 reverse girls where you just the 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.610
 hand because before a body lives and she 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.040
 then slowly and always checked at 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.690
 lives and distracts the poor 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.090
 but only up to about shoulder level 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.980
 do not lift the body while doing so 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:20.810
 so only the poor swing 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:23.540
 you can still work completely 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.610
 like to do are the beat steaks and that 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.950
 soon your arms in 90 degrees angle again 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.630
 and bring it in front of everyone's head and then 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.640
 makes her always easy fast war 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.230
 Movements with the trade upwards 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.760
 and if you like that for a minute 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.959
 then I guarantee you that yours 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.850
 biceps in any case burns thanks to man 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.890
 the sales times around the triceps so we 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.660
 in the summer also have no arms woke 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.880
 The first thing you want is the 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.260
 Bigbags are really effective 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.209
 because do you imagine just write a 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.470
 I go and should the upper body like that 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.090
 slightly forward 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.310
 arms very close to the body 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.989
 Keep and always put your forearm on 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.090
 and push back with the 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.250
 Dumbbell and really only the 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.079
 move forearm and keep your upper arm tight 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.989
 let body and then he also realizes 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:08.030
 Again triceps works then I do 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.769
 still like the triceps behind the back 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.329
 head with a short change 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.700
 we'll just take them in both hands 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:15.680
 and lead them behind your head and then 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.870
 always lower the hand slightly and 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.970
 pulling up again stretches the poor but 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.680
 never completely pull up with it 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.730
 Do not hurt yourself and keep your head 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.730
 as bland as possible 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.980
 then it continues with the two 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.560
 Exercises and there I guarantee you too 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.330
 in any case, muscle first 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.100
 a super easy exercise we all 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.780
 namely know the buildings 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.180
 I know so simplified but still 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.740
 to become really expensive three 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.360
 Repeats then feel mine 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:55.210
 thigh and my song then always so 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:57.190
 really doll just as individual exercises 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.930
 are the selection steps I know that 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.030
 is a standard thing in every sport 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.410
 video shows up but rightly the children 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.960
 always right 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.640
 I use this again act three kilo 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.480
 for a bit extra weight of the caddy 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.480
 open up if you want 

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:21.920
 variation of course also the 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.690
 standards because the legs are nice and wide 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.460
 set apart and then the butt 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.090
 back as far as possible 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.920
 push 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.780
 Of course you can do it again 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.780
 or without extra dishes 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:38.360
 the jump are also really killer 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.580
 but just in the starting position of the 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.930
 go spots and then blow up there 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.000
 then one always looks a bit 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.290
 like his hobby haase and i hold the 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.670
 Poor for a little more 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:56.720
 Balance even before the body 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:58.400
 together and this variant is synonymous 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.530
 really nice on the thighs 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.780
 just with this squad attitude respectively 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.460
 three times the focus really nice 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.080
 far down jaja there is synonymous 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.300
 I see a little more with me 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.450
 straight and that is also really strict 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.450
 on 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.520
 more than space is of course also 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.350
 What do the abdominals do? 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.290
 I show you my favorite exercise right there 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.480
 First of the room on the back 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:37.210
 put hands as a support under the buttocks 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.250
 and then lift the legs straight 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:42.180
 and why scissors always back and forth 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.180
 crossing 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.450
 this exercise jumps the abdominal muscles 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.040
 also right on the hands as a support 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.020
 again under the butt and then the 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:18.030
 legs up to the body 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:19.410
 click and have the body away again 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.360
 Of course we also have the classic ones 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:23.250
 I really like crunches too 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.530
 I like because they are super effective 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:27.930
 are the legs in the 90 degree angle 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:30.270
 hands are raised behind the head and 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:32.100
 it also does not pay attention to the head 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:35.420
 buckle too far but really nice 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.420
 hold straight up 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.919
 now a little bit the lateral ones 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.500
 to train abdominal muscles is this 

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:50.270
 time , exercise is easy 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.250
 Take a dumbbell in both hands 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.900
 Raise the legs slightly and then the dumbbell 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:56.449
 always from one side to the other 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.669
 brings and moves as possible 

00:06:56.449 --> 00:07:10.550
 only the upper body and the legs hold 

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:12.169
 her as well as possible for 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:15.020
 the lateral abdominal muscles are these 

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:16.820
 pages ensure that supported it 

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.770
 in the butt lifts nicely and not 

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.600
 hang it all down on the 

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:24.850
 each side about 30 seconds 

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.850
 keep it and it also strains correctly 

00:07:32.889 --> 00:07:36.590
 and then as labs is also one 

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.479
 my favorite exercise because she too 

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:40.759
 super effective is the play 

00:07:38.479 --> 00:07:43.009
 click here here the entrance if the 

00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:45.319
 baggage delivery position and then you give 

00:07:43.009 --> 00:07:47.979
 with each of your hips on the floor 

00:07:45.319 --> 00:07:47.979
 the page 

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:52.460
 that was the last exercise 

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:54.860
 i was really turning after this 

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:56.719
 absolutely ko I hope but the video was 

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:58.430
 helpful for you guys 

00:07:56.719 --> 00:08:00.199
 like the two linked videos 

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:03.009
 if you want and if we want the pages 

00:08:00.199 --> 00:08:03.009
 Until next time
