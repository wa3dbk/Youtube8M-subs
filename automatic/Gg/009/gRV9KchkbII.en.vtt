know<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.930> could<00:01:37.110> be<00:01:37.140> an<00:01:37.320> early<00:01:37.409> early<00:01:38.189> rollover

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
know it could be an early early rollover

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.580 
know it could be an early early rollover
that<00:01:39.360> lands<00:01:39.540> back<00:01:39.750> on<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.020> wheels<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.409> could

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
that lands back on the wheels that could

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.899 
that lands back on the wheels that could
that<00:01:40.799> could<00:01:40.950> give<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.400> win<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.790> if<00:01:41.880> you

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
that could give you that win and if you

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.219 
that could give you that win and if you
just<00:01:42.119> don't<00:01:42.329> roll<00:01:42.450> over<00:01:42.509> it's<00:01:42.899> just<00:01:43.049> not

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
just don't roll over it's just not

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.780
