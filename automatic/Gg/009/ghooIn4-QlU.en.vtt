living I've been trying to work on
getting<00:00:16.980> faster<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:17.760> getting<00:00:18.449> in<00:00:18.600> position

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
getting faster and getting in position

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.040 
getting faster and getting in position
faster<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.619> roping<00:00:19.890> faster<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.970> one<00:00:21.900> of<00:00:21.990> the

faster and roping faster and one of the
problems<00:00:22.289> I<00:00:22.619> faced<00:00:22.949> when<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:23.609> went<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.660> start

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
problems I faced when I went to to start

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.070 
problems I faced when I went to to start
going<00:00:25.050> faster<00:00:25.320> was<00:00:25.830> whenever<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.670> would<00:00:27.080> go

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
going faster was whenever I would go

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.980 
going faster was whenever I would go
down<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.529> arena<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:30.240> would<00:00:30.420> want<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.720> throw

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
down the arena and I would want to throw

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.650 
down the arena and I would want to throw
I<00:00:31.529> would<00:00:32.219> want<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.489> deliver<00:00:32.820> as<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.270> was<00:00:33.420> turning

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
I would want to deliver as I was turning

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.340 
I would want to deliver as I was turning
the<00:00:33.809> corner

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
the corner

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.160 
the corner
I<00:00:34.670> couldn't<00:00:35.670> get<00:00:35.760> my<00:00:35.820> loops<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.420> be<00:00:36.780> like<00:00:37.020> I

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
I couldn't get my loops to be like I

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.330 
I couldn't get my loops to be like I
wanted<00:00:37.469> them<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.649> okay<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:39.680> we<00:00:40.680> all<00:00:40.829> know<00:00:41.100> that

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
wanted them to okay and we all know that

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.860 
wanted them to okay and we all know that
it's<00:00:41.520> easier<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:41.910> come<00:00:42.180> around<00:00:42.450> there<00:00:42.629> and

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
it's easier to come around there and

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.569 
it's easier to come around there and
track<00:00:43.260> one<00:00:43.590> where<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:43.920> can<00:00:44.100> get<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.399> angle

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
track one where you can get the angle

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.940 
track one where you can get the angle
your<00:00:44.910> swing<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.360> everything<00:00:45.750> right<00:00:45.930> but<00:00:46.200> when

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
your swing and everything right but when

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.410 
your swing and everything right but when
you're<00:00:47.100> roping<00:00:47.430> against<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:47.969> guys<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.300> I

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
you're roping against the guys that I

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.970 
you're roping against the guys that I
rope<00:00:48.629> against<00:00:48.989> day<00:00:49.140> in<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.410> day<00:00:49.440> out<00:00:49.559> you

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
rope against day in and day out you

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.680 
rope against day in and day out you
don't<00:00:50.100> have<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.489> luxury<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:51.239> track<00:00:51.480> those

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
don't have that luxury to track those

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.930 
don't have that luxury to track those
steers<00:00:51.930> like<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.489> what<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.520> couldn't<00:00:53.820> figure

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
steers like that what I couldn't figure

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.260 
steers like that what I couldn't figure
out<00:00:54.090> was<00:00:54.390> why<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.719> could<00:00:55.460> go<00:00:56.460> across<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.090> arena

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
out was why I could go across the arena

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.619 
out was why I could go across the arena
a<00:00:57.629> jump<00:00:58.230> or<00:00:58.500> two<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.070> rope<00:00:59.699> but<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.180> couldn't

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
a jump or two and rope but I couldn't

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.170 
a jump or two and rope but I couldn't
turn<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.350> corner<00:01:01.710> in<00:01:01.770> rode<00:01:01.949> well<00:01:02.699> what<00:01:03.149> I

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
turn the corner in rode well what I

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.789 
turn the corner in rode well what I
finally<00:01:03.570> figured<00:01:04.049> out<00:01:04.199> was<00:01:04.379> is<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.619> the

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
finally figured out was is that the

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.550 
finally figured out was is that the
angle<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.250> my<00:01:05.309> swing<00:01:05.670> wasn't<00:01:06.180> correct<00:01:06.540> okay<00:01:07.350> I

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
angle of my swing wasn't correct okay I

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.850 
angle of my swing wasn't correct okay I
was<00:01:08.189> roping<00:01:08.549> my<00:01:08.670> dummy<00:01:08.970> I<00:01:09.270> would<00:01:10.200> stand<00:01:10.470> square

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
was roping my dummy I would stand square

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.200 
was roping my dummy I would stand square
with<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.130> dummy<00:01:11.340> like<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:11.820> just<00:01:12.060> like

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
with the dummy like this just like

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.969 
with the dummy like this just like
you're<00:01:12.420> supposed<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.110> then<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:13.950> would

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
you're supposed to and then I would

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.960 
you're supposed to and then I would
probably<00:01:14.549> step<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.420> rope<00:01:15.600> alright<00:01:16.970> the

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
probably step to it the rope alright the

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.249 
probably step to it the rope alright the
more<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.210> got<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.479> thinking<00:01:18.720> about<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:19.080> I

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
more I got to thinking about this I

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.399 
more I got to thinking about this I
thought<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.860> know<00:01:19.979> when<00:01:20.430> I'm<00:01:20.549> on<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.700> horse

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
thought you know when I'm on a horse

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.080 
thought you know when I'm on a horse
it's<00:01:22.409> hard<00:01:22.650> for<00:01:22.799> me<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.040> get<00:01:23.220> one<00:01:23.460> foot<00:01:23.759> forward

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
it's hard for me to get one foot forward

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.700 
it's hard for me to get one foot forward
or<00:01:24.479> one<00:01:24.659> foot<00:01:24.900> farther<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:25.350> front<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.619> the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
or one foot farther in front of the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.080 
or one foot farther in front of the
other<00:01:25.860> one<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.310> know<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.490> can<00:01:26.700> do<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.850> little

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
other one you know you can do a little

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.330 
other one you know you can do a little
bit<00:01:27.330> by<00:01:27.479> pivoting<00:01:27.900> your<00:01:27.960> body<00:01:28.290> but<00:01:28.560> as<00:01:29.009> far<00:01:29.310> as

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
bit by pivoting your body but as far as

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.010 
bit by pivoting your body but as far as
being<00:01:29.729> on<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.880> horse<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.329> taking<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.720> step

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
being on a horse and taking a step

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.130 
being on a horse and taking a step
that's<00:01:31.320> really<00:01:31.560> hard<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.860> do<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.479> think<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.689> think

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
that's really hard to do I think I think

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.660 
that's really hard to do I think I think
when<00:01:34.290> we<00:01:34.409> rope<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:34.860> think<00:01:35.130> we're<00:01:35.280> more<00:01:35.460> like

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
when we rope I think we're more like

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.410 
when we rope I think we're more like
this<00:01:36.259> with<00:01:37.259> our<00:01:37.409> feet<00:01:37.619> straight<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.909> way<00:01:39.119> and

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
this with our feet straight this way and

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.300 
this with our feet straight this way and
I<00:01:39.479> think<00:01:39.540> we<00:01:39.840> put<00:01:40.079> more<00:01:40.470> weight<00:01:40.710> on<00:01:40.770> one<00:01:41.280> side

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
I think we put more weight on one side

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.789 
I think we put more weight on one side
than<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.850> other<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:42.299> think<00:01:43.079> that's<00:01:43.259> okay<00:01:43.560> but<00:01:43.740> I

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
than the other I think that's okay but I

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.679 
than the other I think that's okay but I
think<00:01:43.860> it's<00:01:44.220> hard<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.670> it's<00:01:44.939> hard<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.299> rope<00:01:45.479> the

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
think it's hard to it's hard to rope the

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.380 
think it's hard to it's hard to rope the
dummy<00:01:45.930> like<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:46.470> stepping<00:01:47.460> forward<00:01:47.729> well<00:01:48.329> we

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
dummy like this stepping forward well we

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.510 
dummy like this stepping forward well we
can't<00:01:48.600> do<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:48.720> on<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:48.960> horse<00:01:49.200> or<00:01:49.500> this<00:01:49.710> way<00:01:49.890> you

my rope at the angle that I was going to

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.990 
my rope at the angle that I was going to
be<00:02:46.590> when<00:02:46.799> I<00:02:46.830> was<00:02:46.920> tracking<00:02:47.340> a<00:02:47.519> steer<00:02:47.760> across

be when I was tracking a steer across
the<00:02:48.180> pin<00:02:48.420> so<00:02:49.170> then<00:02:49.349> when<00:02:49.470> I<00:02:49.500> would<00:02:49.620> get<00:02:49.890> on<00:02:50.010> my

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
the pin so then when I would get on my

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.520 
the pin so then when I would get on my
horse<00:02:50.370> when<00:02:51.299> I<00:02:51.330> would<00:02:51.540> pick<00:02:51.750> up<00:02:51.780> my<00:02:51.930> rope<00:02:52.260> I

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
horse when I would pick up my rope I

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.350 
horse when I would pick up my rope I
would<00:02:52.739> be<00:02:52.890> swinging<00:02:53.280> my<00:02:53.400> relative<00:02:53.819> this<00:02:53.940> angle

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
would be swinging my relative this angle

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.420 
would be swinging my relative this angle
right<00:02:54.480> here<00:02:54.680> and<00:02:55.680> then<00:02:55.890> when<00:02:56.040> I<00:02:56.069> would<00:02:56.280> come

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
right here and then when I would come

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.250 
right here and then when I would come
around<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:56.790> corner<00:02:57.000> I<00:02:57.360> had<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:57.780> wrong<00:02:57.959> angle

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
around the corner I had the wrong angle

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.380 
around the corner I had the wrong angle
and<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:59.430> rope<00:02:59.610> was<00:02:59.790> trying<00:03:00.060> to<00:03:00.180> come<00:03:00.360> down

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
and the rope was trying to come down

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.360 
and the rope was trying to come down
from<00:03:00.840> under<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:01.230> up<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:01.739> I<00:03:01.769> was<00:03:01.920> dragging<00:03:02.280> too

much ground so with this drill what it
makes<00:03:07.049> you<00:03:07.230> realize<00:03:07.650> as<00:03:08.190> a<00:03:08.250> healer<00:03:08.840> when<00:03:09.840> I

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
makes you realize as a healer when I
