does is it takes a digital signal which

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.590 
does is it takes a digital signal which
your<00:01:01.590> music<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.280> unless<00:01:03.120> you're<00:01:03.420> talking

your music is unless you're talking

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.260 
your music is unless you're talking
about<00:01:03.930> like<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.830> know<00:01:04.920> records<00:01:05.339> or<00:01:05.670> cassette

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
about like you know records or cassette

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.719 
about like you know records or cassette
tapes<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.290> takes<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.590> digital<00:01:07.920> signal<00:01:08.430> and

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
tapes so it takes a digital signal and

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.850 
tapes so it takes a digital signal and
turns<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.150> into<00:01:09.270> an<00:01:09.570> analog<00:01:10.080> output<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.710> can

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
turns it into an analog output that can

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.469 
turns it into an analog output that can
be<00:01:10.950> interpreted<00:01:11.220> by<00:01:11.610> headphones<00:01:12.180> or<00:01:12.450> speakers

in<00:01:38.310> by<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.000> then<00:01:39.240> plugs<00:01:39.540> into<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.840> USB

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
in by that and then plugs into a USB

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.440 
in by that and then plugs into a USB
port<00:01:40.470> on<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.710> computer<00:01:41.070> at<00:01:41.640> manage<00:01:42.180> number

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
port on the computer at manage number

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.200 
port on the computer at manage number
two<00:01:42.689> is<00:01:42.960> because<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:43.710> completely<00:01:44.700> removed

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
two is because it is completely removed

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.929 
two is because it is completely removed
from<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.899> internals<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.470> your<00:01:46.649> PC<00:01:47.130> there's<00:01:47.610> no

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
from the internals of your PC there's no

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.760 
from the internals of your PC there's no
real<00:01:48.210> risk<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.869> electromagnetic

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
real risk of electromagnetic

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:50.630 
real risk of electromagnetic
interference

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
interference

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.490

now<00:01:51.000> many<00:01:51.299> internal<00:01:51.750> sound<00:01:51.990> cards<00:01:52.320> have

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
now many internal sound cards have

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.050 
now many internal sound cards have
things<00:01:52.710> like<00:01:52.920> shields<00:01:53.369> on<00:01:53.490> them<00:01:53.670> but

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
things like shields on them but

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.389 
things like shields on them but
obviously<00:01:54.840> it's<00:01:55.079> better<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.890> move<00:01:56.070> away<00:01:56.189> from

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
obviously it's better to move away from

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.929 
obviously it's better to move away from
the<00:01:56.729> EMI<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.920> put<00:01:58.920> an<00:01:59.009> aluminum<00:01:59.430> shield<00:01:59.700> over

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
the EMI and put an aluminum shield over

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.660 
the EMI and put an aluminum shield over
the<00:02:00.149> whole<00:02:00.329> device<00:02:00.689> anyway<00:02:01.619> so<00:02:02.159> without

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
the whole device anyway so without

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.090 
the whole device anyway so without
further<00:02:02.939> ado<00:02:03.360> oh<00:02:03.570> yeah<00:02:03.869> right<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.860> next

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
like response curves and you can

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.740 
like response curves and you can
actually<00:02:38.519> see<00:02:38.939> they're<00:02:39.120> not<00:02:39.239> just<00:02:39.450> saying<00:02:39.629> oh

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
actually see they're not just saying oh

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.869 
actually see they're not just saying oh
well<00:02:39.930> it<00:02:40.019> has<00:02:40.170> a<00:02:40.200> you<00:02:40.530> know<00:02:40.650> flat<00:02:41.099> frequency

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
well it has a you know flat frequency

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.490 
well it has a you know flat frequency
response<00:02:42.209> no<00:02:42.569> they're<00:02:42.810> actually<00:02:42.930> telling<00:02:43.409> you

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
response no they're actually telling you

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.710 
response no they're actually telling you
exactly<00:02:43.890> how<00:02:44.069> much<00:02:44.220> it<00:02:44.370> has<00:02:44.549> and<00:02:44.849> then<00:02:45.299> to<00:02:45.599> go

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
exactly how much it has and then to go

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.319 
exactly how much it has and then to go
along<00:02:46.049> with<00:02:46.079> the<00:02:46.440> bass<00:02:46.739> boost<00:02:47.099> button<00:02:48.060> which

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
along with the bass boost button which

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:50.210 
along with the bass boost button which
is<00:02:48.389> right<00:02:48.540> here<00:02:48.690> so<00:02:48.930> there's<00:02:49.230> actually<00:02:49.799> a<00:02:49.829> +3

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
is right here so there's actually a +3

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.460 
is right here so there's actually a +3
decibel<00:02:50.879> bass<00:02:51.060> boost<00:02:51.359> they<00:02:51.930> actually<00:02:52.290> show

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
decibel bass boost they actually show

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.569 
decibel bass boost they actually show
you<00:02:52.530> what<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.829> curve<00:02:53.010> looks<00:02:53.250> like<00:02:53.310> once

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
you what the curve looks like once

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:54.920 
you what the curve looks like once
you've<00:02:53.730> enabled<00:02:53.879> that<00:02:54.150> as<00:02:54.359> well<00:02:54.540> and<00:02:54.720> it<00:02:54.780> looks

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
you've enabled that as well and it looks

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.229 
you've enabled that as well and it looks
quite<00:02:55.139> good<00:02:55.620> so<00:02:55.889> you're<00:02:56.040> getting<00:02:56.370> quite<00:02:56.879> a<00:02:56.939> lot

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
quite good so you're getting quite a lot

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.179 
quite good so you're getting quite a lot
of<00:02:57.269> bass<00:02:57.540> up<00:02:57.810> at<00:02:58.079> the<00:02:58.349> I<00:02:58.379> guess<00:02:58.680> I<00:02:58.829> should

00:02:59.179 --> 00:02:59.189 
of bass up at the I guess I should

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:00.530 
of bass up at the I guess I should
mirror<00:02:59.519> it<00:02:59.639> so<00:02:59.790> you're<00:02:59.939> getting<00:03:00.120> quite<00:03:00.269> a<00:03:00.329> lot

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
mirror it so you're getting quite a lot

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.420 
mirror it so you're getting quite a lot
of<00:03:00.629> bass<00:03:00.750> up<00:03:00.989> here<00:03:01.349> and<00:03:01.500> then<00:03:01.950> it<00:03:02.129> comes<00:03:02.340> down

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
of bass up here and then it comes down

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.280 
of bass up here and then it comes down
and<00:03:02.609> two<00:03:02.909> more<00:03:03.150> of<00:03:03.359> that<00:03:03.540> flat<00:03:03.840> curve<00:03:04.079> that<00:03:04.200> you

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
and two more of that flat curve that you

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.899 
and two more of that flat curve that you
saw<00:03:04.500> before<00:03:04.920> you<00:03:05.010> enable<00:03:05.280> bass<00:03:05.430> boost<00:03:05.700> now<00:03:05.849> the

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:05.909 
saw before you enable bass boost now the

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:08.119 
saw before you enable bass boost now the
more<00:03:06.090> steep<00:03:06.329> that<00:03:06.540> line<00:03:06.780> is<00:03:07.019> the<00:03:07.439> more<00:03:07.590> punchy

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
more steep that line is the more punchy

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:09.649 
more steep that line is the more punchy
the<00:03:08.250> bass<00:03:08.400> will<00:03:08.609> sound<00:03:08.849> particularly<00:03:09.450> at<00:03:09.569> the

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
the bass will sound particularly at the

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:12.020 
the bass will sound particularly at the
low<00:03:09.780> end<00:03:09.989> and<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.230> more<00:03:10.670> gradual<00:03:11.670> that<00:03:11.790> line

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
low end and the more gradual that line

oh<00:04:34.470> now<00:04:34.650> this<00:04:34.800> is<00:04:34.919> kind<00:04:35.099> of<00:04:35.129> a<00:04:35.250> funny<00:04:35.490> one<00:04:35.669> to<00:04:35.849> me

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
oh now this is kind of a funny one to me

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.839

a digital audio signal and it won't be

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:45.980 
amplified so you've got a DAC an amp and
then<00:04:44.310> you're<00:04:44.729> going<00:04:44.819> to<00:04:44.909> send<00:04:45.090> a<00:04:45.210> non<00:04:45.419> non

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
then you're going to send a non non

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.260 
then you're going to send a non non
decoded<00:04:46.560> non<00:04:46.770> amplified<00:04:47.629> anyway<00:04:48.860> so<00:04:49.860> the

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
decoded non amplified anyway so the

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.430 
decoded non amplified anyway so the
purpose<00:04:51.270> of<00:04:51.389> it<00:04:51.569> is<00:04:51.659> if<00:04:51.780> you<00:04:51.900> wanted<00:04:52.199> to<00:04:52.349> run

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
purpose of it is if you wanted to run

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.010 
purpose of it is if you wanted to run
something<00:04:52.740> like<00:04:52.860> an<00:04:53.280> AV<00:04:53.520> receiver<00:04:54.150> which<00:04:54.840> has

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
something like an AV receiver which has

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.170 
something like an AV receiver which has
its<00:04:55.199> own<00:04:55.440> amp<00:04:55.680> and<00:04:55.889> DAC<00:04:56.069> off<00:04:56.340> of<00:04:56.789> like<00:04:56.970> your

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
its own amp and DAC off of like your

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.640 
its own amp and DAC off of like your
MacBook<00:04:57.569> which<00:04:57.780> obviously<00:04:58.110> doesn't<00:04:58.530> have<00:04:58.620> a

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
MacBook which obviously doesn't have a

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.670 
MacBook which obviously doesn't have a
coax<00:04:59.039> out<00:04:59.250> then<00:04:59.819> you<00:05:00.000> could<00:05:00.240> go<00:05:00.449> USB<00:05:00.960> into<00:05:01.319> coax

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
coax out then you could go USB into coax

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.930 
coax out then you could go USB into coax
out<00:05:01.860> and<00:05:02.069> then<00:05:02.159> you<00:05:02.250> could<00:05:02.430> play<00:05:02.550> your<00:05:02.699> music

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
out and then you could play your music

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.249 
out and then you could play your music
off<00:05:03.030> there<00:05:03.180> if<00:05:03.270> you<00:05:03.360> really<00:05:03.780> wanted<00:05:04.080> to<00:05:04.110> do

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:04.259 
off there if you really wanted to do

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:06.680 
off there if you really wanted to do
something<00:05:04.289> like<00:05:04.680> that<00:05:04.740> but<00:05:05.130> whatever<00:05:05.539> also<00:05:06.539> on

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
something like that but whatever also on

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.600 
something like that but whatever also on
the<00:05:06.810> back<00:05:06.960> there's<00:05:07.229> a<00:05:07.289> line<00:05:07.530> out<00:05:07.740> so<00:05:08.280> you<00:05:08.370> can

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
the back there's a line out so you can

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.309 
the back there's a line out so you can
use<00:05:08.789> that<00:05:09.030> to<00:05:09.360> plug<00:05:09.659> into<00:05:09.810> something<00:05:10.199> like

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:10.319 
use that to plug into something like

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:13.040 
use that to plug into something like
powered<00:05:10.830> speakers<00:05:11.310> so<00:05:11.759> it<00:05:11.909> really<00:05:12.360> does<00:05:12.630> take

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
powered speakers so it really does take

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.830 
powered speakers so it really does take
the<00:05:13.080> place<00:05:13.680> of<00:05:14.069> a<00:05:14.580> sound<00:05:14.849> card<00:05:15.120> in<00:05:15.300> your<00:05:15.419> system

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
the place of a sound card in your system

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.080 
the place of a sound card in your system
and<00:05:16.020> particularly<00:05:16.650> for<00:05:17.099> mobile<00:05:17.430> users<00:05:17.729> where

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
and particularly for mobile users where

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:19.700 
and particularly for mobile users where
it's<00:05:18.270> difficult<00:05:18.449> to<00:05:18.780> add<00:05:18.900> a<00:05:18.930> sound<00:05:19.229> card<00:05:19.440> or

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
it's difficult to add a sound card or

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.490 
it's difficult to add a sound card or
for<00:05:20.580> people<00:05:21.360> who<00:05:21.509> don't<00:05:21.810> necessarily<00:05:21.990> have

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
for people who don't necessarily have

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.529 
for people who don't necessarily have
more<00:05:22.860> expansion<00:05:23.430> slots<00:05:23.729> like<00:05:23.969> if<00:05:24.120> you<00:05:24.240> run<00:05:24.419> an

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:24.539 
more expansion slots like if you run an

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:27.200 
more expansion slots like if you run an
ITX<00:05:25.020> machine<00:05:25.440> or<00:05:25.590> m<00:05:25.710> ATX<00:05:26.159> machine<00:05:26.490> that's<00:05:26.699> full

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
ITX machine or m ATX machine that's full

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.240 
ITX machine or m ATX machine that's full
of<00:05:27.240> graphics<00:05:27.750> cards<00:05:27.810> these<00:05:28.680> can<00:05:29.099> be<00:05:29.219> a

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
of graphics cards these can be a

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.939 
of graphics cards these can be a
fantastic<00:05:29.960> option<00:05:30.960> on<00:05:31.139> the<00:05:31.530> bottom<00:05:31.770> there's

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:31.949 
fantastic option on the bottom there's

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:33.140 
fantastic option on the bottom there's
one<00:05:32.099> thing<00:05:32.250> that<00:05:32.310> I<00:05:32.430> had<00:05:32.610> actually<00:05:32.759> missed

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
one thing that I had actually missed

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.700 
one thing that I had actually missed
there<00:05:33.300> so<00:05:33.449> there's<00:05:33.630> a<00:05:33.690> low<00:05:33.870> or<00:05:34.080> high<00:05:34.380> gain

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
there so there's a low or high gain

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.159 
there so there's a low or high gain
switch<00:05:35.009> this<00:05:35.370> is<00:05:35.430> basically<00:05:35.909> for<00:05:36.169> headphones

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
switch this is basically for headphones

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:39.110 
switch this is basically for headphones
that<00:05:37.620> are<00:05:37.680> are<00:05:38.099> lower<00:05:38.310> or<00:05:38.430> higher<00:05:38.580> impedance

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
that are are lower or higher impedance

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.120 
that are are lower or higher impedance
so<00:05:39.719> you<00:05:39.810> want<00:05:39.960> to<00:05:40.020> turn<00:05:40.169> the<00:05:40.289> gain<00:05:40.469> up<00:05:40.650> if<00:05:41.039> you

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
so you want to turn the gain up if you

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.499 
so you want to turn the gain up if you
have<00:05:41.250> high<00:05:41.400> impedance<00:05:41.669> headphones<00:05:41.969> and<00:05:42.419> the

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:42.509 
have high impedance headphones and the

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:44.899 
have high impedance headphones and the
e10<00:05:42.840> can<00:05:43.050> handle<00:05:43.289> up<00:05:43.409> to<00:05:43.469> 300<00:05:44.340> ohm<00:05:44.430> headphones

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:44.909 
e10 can handle up to 300 ohm headphones

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:46.670 
e10 can handle up to 300 ohm headphones
and<00:05:45.180> then<00:05:45.509> you<00:05:45.599> want<00:05:45.750> to<00:05:45.840> turn<00:05:45.960> it<00:05:46.080> down<00:05:46.110> for

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
and then you want to turn it down for

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.399 
and then you want to turn it down for
anything<00:05:47.159> down<00:05:47.490> to<00:05:47.819> it's<00:05:48.150> rated<00:05:48.509> to<00:05:48.630> around<00:05:48.840> 16

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:49.409 
anything down to it's rated to around 16

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:54.290 
anything down to it's rated to around 16
ohm<00:05:49.590> headphones<00:05:50.810> so<00:05:51.810> 16<00:05:52.169> to<00:05:52.319> 300<00:05:52.770> ohms<00:05:53.300> the

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
ohm headphones so 16 to 300 ohms the

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.730 
ohm headphones so 16 to 300 ohms the
last<00:05:54.509> thing<00:05:54.659> that's<00:05:54.779> included<00:05:55.319> are<00:05:55.469> eight

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
last thing that's included are eight

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.290 
last thing that's included are eight
little<00:05:56.099> rubber<00:05:56.310> feet<00:05:56.400> so<00:05:56.849> you<00:05:56.909> can<00:05:57.150> actually

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
little rubber feet so you can actually

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.029 
little rubber feet so you can actually
put<00:05:57.719> those<00:05:57.870> wherever<00:05:58.259> you<00:05:58.440> want<00:05:58.650> it<00:05:58.860> if<00:05:59.009> you

00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 
put those wherever you want it if you

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:01.249 
put those wherever you want it if you
wanted<00:05:59.340> it<00:05:59.430> to<00:05:59.460> stand<00:05:59.940> on<00:06:00.360> you<00:06:00.750> know<00:06:00.870> this<00:06:01.050> way

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:01.259 
wanted it to stand on you know this way

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:02.629 
wanted it to stand on you know this way
then<00:06:01.500> you<00:06:01.590> could<00:06:01.740> do<00:06:01.860> that<00:06:01.979> or<00:06:02.279> this<00:06:02.370> way<00:06:02.610> or

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:02.639 
then you could do that or this way or

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:04.159 
then you could do that or this way or
you<00:06:03.060> could<00:06:03.270> put<00:06:03.419> all<00:06:03.509> eight<00:06:03.539> of<00:06:03.690> them<00:06:03.840> on<00:06:03.930> same

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 
you could put all eight of them on same

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:05.269 
you could put all eight of them on same
time<00:06:04.319> I<00:06:04.380> don't<00:06:04.440> know<00:06:04.590> whatever<00:06:05.039> the<00:06:05.190> reason

00:06:05.269 --> 00:06:05.279 
time I don't know whatever the reason

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:07.010 
time I don't know whatever the reason
they<00:06:05.639> include<00:06:05.940> eight<00:06:06.090> is<00:06:06.240> they<00:06:06.449> include<00:06:06.810> eight

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
they include eight is they include eight

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.290 
they include eight is they include eight
of<00:06:07.169> them<00:06:07.259> and<00:06:07.469> I<00:06:07.979> guess<00:06:08.190> what's<00:06:08.669> left<00:06:08.969> to<00:06:09.150> wrap

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
of them and I guess what's left to wrap

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.680 
of them and I guess what's left to wrap
up<00:06:09.509> with<00:06:09.719> is<00:06:10.400> why<00:06:11.400> this<00:06:11.460> because<00:06:12.150> file<00:06:12.449> has<00:06:12.659> a

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:12.690 
up with is why this because file has a

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:14.120 
up with is why this because file has a
ton<00:06:13.080> of<00:06:13.110> different<00:06:13.289> products<00:06:13.860> some<00:06:13.979> of<00:06:14.009> which

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.130 
ton of different products some of which

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:15.950 
ton of different products some of which
are<00:06:14.400> just<00:06:14.430> amps<00:06:15.000> so<00:06:15.180> they're<00:06:15.449> meant<00:06:15.630> to<00:06:15.690> take<00:06:15.930> a

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
are just amps so they're meant to take a

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.809 
are just amps so they're meant to take a
source<00:06:16.289> from<00:06:16.529> something<00:06:16.919> like<00:06:17.099> an<00:06:17.310> mp3<00:06:17.580> player

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:17.819
