00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
are new to me and so I'm just not really

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.369 
are new to me and so I'm just not really
used<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.129> getting<00:00:56.760> this<00:00:57.030> done<00:00:57.350> I've<00:00:58.350> had

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
used to getting this done I've had

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.639 
used to getting this done I've had
probably<00:00:58.890> five<00:00:59.309> cavities<00:00:59.910> my<00:01:00.180> whole<00:01:00.359> life<00:01:00.649> and

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
probably five cavities my whole life and

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.600 
probably five cavities my whole life and
so<00:01:01.949> it's<00:01:02.129> just<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.789> get<00:01:03.660> nervous<00:01:04.010> I'm<00:01:05.010> really

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
so it's just I get nervous I'm really

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.850 
so it's just I get nervous I'm really
shaky<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.270> wish<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.570> had<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.750> volume<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.500> don't<00:01:07.770> know

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
shaky I wish I had a volume I don't know

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.670 
shaky I wish I had a volume I don't know
why<00:01:08.010> I'm<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:08.850> nervous<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.570> tried<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.320> like<00:01:10.500> get<00:01:10.650> a

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
why I'm so nervous I tried to like get a

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.350 
why I'm so nervous I tried to like get a
good<00:01:10.890> picture<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.400> crack<00:01:11.729> but<00:01:11.970> it's<00:01:12.180> my

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
good picture of the crack but it's my

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.230 
good picture of the crack but it's my
very<00:01:12.720> back<00:01:13.020> molar<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.430> it's<00:01:14.760> kind<00:01:15.180> of

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
very back molar and so it's kind of

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.600 
very back molar and so it's kind of
difficult<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.810> get<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.020> camera<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.439> focus

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
difficult to get the camera to focus

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.970 
difficult to get the camera to focus
so<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.360> don't<00:01:18.600> think<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:18.870> gotta<00:01:19.050> go<00:01:19.140> dude<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:19.680> think
