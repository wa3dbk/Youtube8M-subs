of thing so anyway that's my take on
that<00:02:51.220> you<00:02:52.220> know<00:02:52.340> do<00:02:52.550> with<00:02:52.670> it<00:02:52.760> what<00:02:52.910> you<00:02:52.940> will

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
that you know do with it what you will

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.670 
that you know do with it what you will
but<00:02:53.209> I'm<00:02:53.480> not<00:02:53.570> a<00:02:53.630> real<00:02:53.810> big<00:02:54.050> believer<00:02:54.380> in<00:02:54.530> the

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
but I'm not a real big believer in the

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.040 
but I'm not a real big believer in the
whole<00:02:54.890> lovey<00:02:55.880> dovey<00:02:56.240> horsey<00:02:56.570> stuff<00:02:56.780> just

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
whole lovey dovey horsey stuff just

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.330 
whole lovey dovey horsey stuff just
because<00:02:57.200> horses<00:02:57.709> don't<00:02:57.800> do<00:02:57.980> that<00:02:58.130> with<00:02:58.250> each

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340
