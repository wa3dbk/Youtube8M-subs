 other otten those buyer movement 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.890

 people with a lot of optimism to know 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.399

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.090
 past 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.610
 else we have here right the 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.660
 folks brought a rather ex cloud headset 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.570
 2 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.629
 the cloud 2 he brought as the great 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:07.830
 differential s sound card it here 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.930
 brings 17.10 cloud is virtual 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.310
 It's but when we talk but not 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.470
 makes it real 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.240
 good the headset it will stay all in 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.790
 around your ear you need to make a 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.400
 set with highlighting will have several points with 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.650
 the quality of the cases that the boy is not 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.650
 so good with our great colleague of 53 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.030
 girls to really be a category 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.970
 higher than the other in the same range 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.460
 price in relation to the drive a 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.320
 sound quality with this with the 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.540
 made specifically for this high 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.820
 speakers in this court, we have 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.829
 to complete an excellent way to 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.890
 who wants the current and out they are not 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.500
 only a 7.1 ong the indicator generator 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.689
 very pleased at the box fire is 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.850
 different does not burst then increases 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.770
 It was in chaos to hear very loud, cool. 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.780
 because even a door that points it 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.210
 even dedicated on the computer does 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.619
 usually is and he also has the 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.170
 microphone control 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.380
 then he recruits cello echo that all 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.020
 environment of you 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.509
 and another tool to get the voice 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.470
 who are the punctual differentials 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:13.630
 of two talking a little 277 of the cloud nÃ© 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.810
 the clown of one who already has a year there goes 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.489
 to make your birthday is already a reset 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.989
 most comfortable on the market 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.970
 we made him wanting really 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.280
 farms like a cloud not a piece of 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.530
 The game's head is that he could 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.709
 play her eight-ten twelve hours straight to the 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.630
 night to make the revelers who put 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.120
 7 at the table has to be like that one 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.220
 discomfort again felt was to be 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.650
 comfortable for us to develop 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.090
 This took another year is 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.760
 developing, we set up the 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.370
 audio laboratory review ex agent has 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.340
 he audio throughout the industry for 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.519
 develop is to test to create everything 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.410
 The ideal is not simply to put our 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:57.549
 do not really understand people. 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:01.150
 the joint and popcorn in the fifth game 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:05.170
 besides the headset we have here the mold 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:07.510
 ask fm radio the one here is work 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.420
 we have it in four sizes and that 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.640
 I treated some examples 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.850
 This is for example here let me see if 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:19.780
 he is the email the p 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:22.380
 this is the m're so he already has it's 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:25.150
 30 for 20 just to not talk bullshit 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.819
 always mix the size but it is a 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.650
 relatively large rpg and picks up 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.950
 other emails from the market here can already 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.500
 could be a way of this one that is 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.980
 today he already has 50 feeling with this 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:42.459
 height that the ex the slab know very well 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.769
 and it's thick for the big the extra 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.690
 large is 4mm thick 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.670
 there is a small and the average is three 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.849
 millimeter is a material to give 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.010
 really need and movement 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:55.870
 and how everything right it's movie it will not 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.299
 have a very high cost it will have a 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.060
 little stopped at the point when teddy is 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:03.879
 of this size and the abnormal size 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.829
 even a little smaller ours will have a 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:07.690
 competitive price and is always the quality 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.769
 repeat after that 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.879
 Something else we 're showing 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:14.319
 here is the pendrive alex movie profile is 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:15.970
 all that is cost-effective in 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.329
 andretti in epic movie memory 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.590
 benefit mouse pad is the cost benefit 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.750
 brings the performance that the gamer who 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.530
 reduced demand at lower cost than 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.900
 accessible 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:29.979
 This is a 16 gb model and it also has 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:33.010
 of 32 and 64 color changes with the capacity is 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:35.710
 from 32 azulzinho 64 negro the people 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:38.199
 specific speed of at least 90 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:41.229
 30 mega writing reading and reading and 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:43.210
 but everyone bought and tested 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:44.800
 knows that this is really the least 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.050
 that we imagine for five years of a 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.880
 that the hosting guarantee is really 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.520
 much more than that you 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.150
 to take the pack was there 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.150
 to perceive
