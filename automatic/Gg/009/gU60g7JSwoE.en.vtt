about<00:04:22.310> the<00:04:22.820> yarn<00:04:23.120> is<00:04:23.420> that<00:04:23.630> when<00:04:23.930> your<00:04:24.080> hair

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
about the yarn is that when your hair

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.800 
about the yarn is that when your hair
starts<00:04:24.680> to<00:04:24.800> get<00:04:24.920> a<00:04:24.950> little<00:04:25.130> frizzy<00:04:25.730> it<00:04:26.360> looks

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
problems with build up I've discovered

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.610 
problems with build up I've discovered
that<00:05:17.160> is<00:05:17.400> to<00:05:17.760> my<00:05:17.910> advantage<00:05:18.420> to<00:05:18.630> retwist

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
that is to my advantage to retwist

braids this part of my hair because this
is<00:05:33.840> where<00:05:34.050> I've<00:05:34.140> seen<00:05:34.410> the<00:05:35.100> most<00:05:35.370> build-up<00:05:36.090> and

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
is where I've seen the most build-up and

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.870 
the build up for me starts at about two
and<00:05:39.480> a<00:05:39.570> half<00:05:39.780> to<00:05:39.990> three<00:05:40.020> weeks

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:48.450 
the thing I like most about yarn is that

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.160 
the thing I like most about yarn is that
it's<00:05:48.660> so<00:05:48.930> easy<00:05:48.960> it's<00:05:49.740> so<00:05:50.670> easy<00:05:50.750> it<00:05:51.750> makes<00:05:51.990> my

have to worry about what the sweat will

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:11.840 
have to worry about what the sweat will
do<00:06:08.940> to<00:06:09.090> my<00:06:09.240> natural<00:06:09.750> hair<00:06:09.960> it<00:06:10.410> just<00:06:10.680> makes<00:06:11.580> my

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
life simpler and the other thing I

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.780 
life simpler and the other thing I
really<00:06:15.990> like<00:06:16.290> about<00:06:16.470> it<00:06:16.650> too<00:06:17.010> is<00:06:17.310> that<00:06:17.340> it's<00:06:17.670> a

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:17.790 
really like about it too is that it's a

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:20.540 
really like about it too is that it's a
great<00:06:18.120> protective<00:06:18.870> style<00:06:19.230> and<00:06:19.710> when<00:06:20.220> you<00:06:20.340> need

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:20.550 
great protective style and when you need

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.150 
great protective style and when you need
a<00:06:20.580> break<00:06:20.880> from<00:06:21.030> your<00:06:21.450> hair<00:06:21.870> which<00:06:22.170> we<00:06:22.380> all<00:06:22.620> do

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:23.160 
a break from your hair which we all do

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:30.270 
a break from your hair which we all do
at<00:06:23.370> times<00:06:23.730> this<00:06:24.600> is<00:06:24.780> a<00:06:24.810> wonderful<00:06:25.440> style

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:30.280 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.650 

the<00:06:30.790> thing<00:06:31.060> I<00:06:31.210> like<00:06:31.450> the<00:06:31.480> least<00:06:32.110> about<00:06:32.530> yarn<00:06:33.250> is

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:33.660 
the thing I like the least about yarn is

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:38.220 
the thing I like the least about yarn is
the<00:06:34.660> fact<00:06:34.990> that<00:06:35.230> I<00:06:36.120> think<00:06:37.120> I<00:06:37.210> get<00:06:37.420> more<00:06:37.450> build

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:38.230 
the fact that I think I get more build

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:41.640 
the fact that I think I get more build
up<00:06:38.470> with<00:06:38.740> a<00:06:38.770> yarn<00:06:39.340> then<00:06:39.940> I<00:06:39.970> did<00:06:40.450> with<00:06:40.840> synthetic

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:41.650 
up with a yarn then I did with synthetic

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:45.420 
up with a yarn then I did with synthetic
hair<00:06:41.680> and<00:06:42.310> to<00:06:43.240> me<00:06:43.510> that<00:06:43.960> has<00:06:44.140> become<00:06:44.380> just<00:06:45.160> like

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:45.430 
hair and to me that has become just like

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:48.180 
hair and to me that has become just like
the<00:06:45.730> thorn<00:06:46.090> in<00:06:46.450> my<00:06:46.600> paw<00:06:46.900> and<00:06:47.350> if<00:06:47.710> I<00:06:47.830> could<00:06:48.010> just

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:48.190 
the thorn in my paw and if I could just

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:50.820 
the thorn in my paw and if I could just
figure<00:06:48.460> out<00:06:48.790> a<00:06:48.820> way<00:06:49.240> to<00:06:49.270> eliminate<00:06:50.080> the<00:06:50.530> amount

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:50.830 
figure out a way to eliminate the amount

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.790 
figure out a way to eliminate the amount
of<00:06:51.040> build-up<00:06:51.550> that<00:06:51.580> I<00:06:51.730> get<00:06:52.320> life<00:06:53.320> would<00:06:53.620> be

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:53.800 
of build-up that I get life would be

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.880 
of build-up that I get life would be
good<00:06:54.070> and<00:06:54.700> I<00:06:55.420> I<00:06:55.900> don't<00:06:56.290> even<00:06:56.350> know<00:06:56.590> if<00:06:56.680> there<00:06:56.860> is

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:56.890 
good and I I don't even know if there is

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:59.220 
good and I I don't even know if there is
a<00:06:57.130> way<00:06:57.490> to<00:06:57.550> eliminate<00:06:58.030> the<00:06:58.450> build-up<00:06:58.840> because

00:06:59.220 --> 00:06:59.230 
a way to eliminate the build-up because

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.230 
a way to eliminate the build-up because
I<00:06:59.470> have<00:06:59.650> pretty<00:06:59.980> much<00:07:00.250> cut<00:07:00.730> back<00:07:00.970> on

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:01.240 
I have pretty much cut back on

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.900 
I have pretty much cut back on
everything<00:07:02.200> that<00:07:02.320> I<00:07:02.380> put<00:07:02.590> in<00:07:02.680> my<00:07:02.800> hair<00:07:03.130> and<00:07:03.430> it

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:03.910 
everything that I put in my hair and it

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:07.470 
everything that I put in my hair and it
still<00:07:04.420> is<00:07:04.840> there<00:07:05.610> but<00:07:06.610> that's<00:07:06.790> my<00:07:06.940> biggest<00:07:07.270> con

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:07.480 
still is there but that's my biggest con

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.610 
still is there but that's my biggest con
it's<00:07:07.870> just<00:07:08.320> the<00:07:08.590> build-up<00:07:09.190> that<00:07:09.250> occurs<00:07:09.820> from

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:10.620 
it's just the build-up that occurs from

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:14.670 
it's just the build-up that occurs from
sweat<00:07:11.620> and<00:07:11.980> dust<00:07:12.280> and<00:07:12.640> products<00:07:13.270> I<00:07:13.450> hope<00:07:14.320> this

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:14.680 
sweat and dust and products I hope this

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.890 
sweat and dust and products I hope this
