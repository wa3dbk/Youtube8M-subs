00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
ten bucks at ten percent off that is a

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.450 
ten bucks at ten percent off that is a
nine<00:01:48.509> bucks<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.530> if<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:49.950> buy<00:01:50.100> them<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.250> lot

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.620 
nine bucks and if you buy them a lot
