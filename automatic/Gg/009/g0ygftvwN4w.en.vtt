00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.610 
I'm fine thanks and so that's just a
straight<00:00:45.390> chord<00:00:45.690> progression<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.320> let's

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
straight chord progression and let's

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.520 
straight chord progression and let's
have<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.770> look<00:00:47.039> at<00:00:47.219> how<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:48.230> scores<00:00:49.230> interact

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
have a look at how the scores interact

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.660 
have a look at how the scores interact
together<00:00:51.440> in<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.620> key<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:53.520> minor<00:00:54.090> this<00:00:55.430> B<00:00:56.430> -

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
together in the key of a minor this B -

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.029 
together in the key of a minor this B -
7<00:00:56.879> flat<00:00:57.030> 5<00:00:57.059> it's<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.510> two<00:00:57.780> chord<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.260> I'm

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
7 flat 5 it's the two chord and I'm

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.729 
7 flat 5 it's the two chord and I'm
playing<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.809> something<00:01:00.809> like<00:01:00.930> this<00:01:03.619> in<00:01:04.619> the

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
playing it something like this in the

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.060 
playing it something like this in the
key<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:05.010> minor<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.519> e<00:01:05.549> minor<00:01:06.240> 7<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:07.590> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
key of a minor the e minor 7 is the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.530 
key of a minor the e minor 7 is the
dominant<00:01:08.430> chord<00:01:08.549> that's<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.850> 5<00:01:09.000> chord<00:01:09.299> and

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
dominant chord that's the 5 chord and

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.420 
dominant chord that's the 5 chord and
I'm<00:01:09.990> playing<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.380> as<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.619> sharp<00:01:10.979> knife<00:01:11.189> so

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
I'm playing it as a sharp knife so

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.890 
I'm playing it as a sharp knife so
that's<00:01:11.580> any<00:01:11.729> wonder<00:01:11.909> 7<00:01:12.150> private<00:01:12.450> parts<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.869> e

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
that's any wonder 7 private parts the e

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.020 
that's any wonder 7 private parts the e
7<00:01:13.260> sharp<00:01:15.320> flat<00:01:16.320> 9<00:01:16.560> it's<00:01:17.250> still<00:01:17.430> dominant<00:01:17.850> chord

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
7 sharp flat 9 it's still dominant chord

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.390 
7 sharp flat 9 it's still dominant chord
and<00:01:18.450> then<00:01:18.720> I<00:01:18.780> resolve<00:01:19.259> back<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.100> tonic

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
and then I resolve back to the tonic

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.260 
and then I resolve back to the tonic
which<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.360> minor

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.609 

so<00:01:27.270> if<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.600> were<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.750> play<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.140> context<00:01:28.530> it

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
so if I were to play that in context it

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:46.249 
so if I were to play that in context it
would<00:01:28.680> be<00:01:28.770> something<00:01:28.950> like<00:01:29.070> this<00:01:45.110> so<00:01:46.110> again

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
would be something like this so again

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.539 
would be something like this so again
that<00:01:46.440> chord<00:01:46.649> progression<00:01:46.680> that's<00:01:47.190> a<00:01:47.280> several

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
that chord progression that's a several

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.420 
that chord progression that's a several
two<00:01:47.670> five<00:01:47.880> one<00:01:48.060> in<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.240> key<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.990> minor<00:01:49.430> it

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
two five one in the key of a minor it

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.120 
two five one in the key of a minor it
has<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.899> minor<00:01:52.619> seven<00:01:52.950> flat<00:01:52.979> five

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
has the the to the minor seven flat five

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.020 
has the the to the minor seven flat five
the<00:01:53.939> five<00:01:54.390> chord<00:01:54.659> which<00:01:54.869> would<00:01:54.990> be<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.350> e<00:01:55.380> and

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
the five chord which would be the e and

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.010 
the five chord which would be the e and
of<00:01:57.030> course<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.330> one<00:01:57.450> chord<00:01:57.689> which<00:01:57.810> would<00:01:57.929> take

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
of course the one chord which would take

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.260 
of course the one chord which would take
you<00:01:58.140> back<00:01:58.229> home<00:01:58.440> to<00:01:58.729> to<00:01:59.729> a<00:01:59.759> minor

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
you back home to to a minor

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.369 
you back home to to a minor
so<00:02:00.720> these<00:02:01.470> guys
