00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
controller and let's get started

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.860 
controller and let's get started
okay<00:00:43.320> so<00:00:43.379> start<00:00:43.920> us<00:00:44.129> off<00:00:44.340> with<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.879> basics<00:00:45.420> I

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
okay so start us off with the basics I

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.810 
okay so start us off with the basics I
kind<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.530> feel<00:00:46.739> like<00:00:46.769> I<00:00:47.010> have<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.339> say<00:00:47.549> it<00:00:47.699> but

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
kind of feel like I have to say it but

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.360 
kind of feel like I have to say it but
it's<00:00:47.970> got<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.210> same<00:00:48.420> square<00:00:48.900> triangle<00:00:49.799> X<00:00:50.040> and

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
it's got the same square triangle X and

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.520 
it's got the same square triangle X and
circle<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:51.659> hasn't<00:00:51.839> changed<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.470> I

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
circle that hasn't changed and I

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.990 
circle that hasn't changed and I
don't<00:00:52.589> think<00:00:52.799> it<00:00:53.010> ever<00:00:53.129> will<00:00:53.400> change<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:53.940> think

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
don't think it ever will change I think

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.030 
don't think it ever will change I think
it<00:00:54.690> will<00:00:54.930> last<00:00:55.290> for<00:00:55.589> as<00:00:55.650> long<00:00:55.769> as<00:00:55.830> the

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
it will last for as long as the

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.430 
it will last for as long as the
PlayStation<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.850> with<00:00:57.690> us<00:00:57.839> I<00:00:58.049> think<00:00:58.260> that's

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
PlayStation is with us I think that's

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.890 
PlayStation is with us I think that's

games like Call of Duty but now with the
ps4<00:01:34.590> controller<00:01:34.890> it's<00:01:35.730> kind<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.150> best<00:01:36.420> of

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
ps4 controller it's kind of a best of

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.390 
ps4 controller it's kind of a best of
both<00:01:36.750> world<00:01:37.080> so<00:01:37.260> there's<00:01:37.590> dome<00:01:37.890> in<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.100> middle

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
both world so there's dome in the middle

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.580 
both world so there's dome in the middle
and<00:01:38.580> also<00:01:39.360> there's<00:01:39.600> this<00:01:39.780> lip<00:01:40.050> around<00:01:40.290> the

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
and also there's this lip around the

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.680 
and also there's this lip around the
edge<00:01:40.680> so<00:01:41.250> whether<00:01:41.820> you're<00:01:42.000> pushing<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.540> or

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
edge so whether you're pushing it or

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.980 
edge so whether you're pushing it or
pulling<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.530> think<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.190> get<00:01:44.400> both<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.870> know

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
pulling it I think you get both you know

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.360 
pulling it I think you get both you know
best<00:01:46.230> of<00:01:46.380> both<00:01:46.500> worlds<00:01:46.830> so<00:01:46.860> that's<00:01:47.130> really

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.370 
best of both worlds so that's really

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:48.560 
best of both worlds so that's really
cool<00:01:47.580> and<00:01:47.700> I'm<00:01:47.790> looking<00:01:48.060> forward<00:01:48.300> to<00:01:48.360> see<00:01:48.540> how

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
cool and I'm looking forward to see how

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.720 
cool and I'm looking forward to see how
that<00:01:48.780> feels<00:01:49.230> the<00:01:49.710> only<00:01:50.100> thing<00:01:50.310> I'm<00:01:50.430> worried

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:50.730 
that feels the only thing I'm worried

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.640 
that feels the only thing I'm worried
about<00:01:50.820> is<00:01:51.150> like<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:52.140> know<00:01:52.290> when<00:01:52.440> you<00:01:52.530> get

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
about is like you know when you get

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:53.990 
about is like you know when you get
controller<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.460> you've<00:01:53.580> had<00:01:53.730> it<00:01:53.820> for<00:01:53.850> a

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
controller and you've had it for a

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.250 
controller and you've had it for a
really<00:01:54.150> long<00:01:54.270> time<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.840> start<00:01:55.050> to<00:01:55.140> get

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
really long time and you start to get

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.230 
really long time and you start to get
like<00:01:55.409> dead<00:01:55.890> skin<00:01:56.190> cells<00:01:56.490> like<00:01:56.760> underneath

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
like dead skin cells like underneath

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.480 
like dead skin cells like underneath
buttons<00:01:57.720> and<00:01:57.900> things<00:01:58.050> yeah<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:58.890> don't<00:01:59.130> want<00:01:59.430> to

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
buttons and things yeah I don't want to

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.840 
buttons and things yeah I don't want to
see<00:01:59.670> that<00:01:59.880> in<00:02:00.120> the<00:02:00.540> thumbsticks<00:02:01.470> so<00:02:01.770> mmm<00:02:02.700> I

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
see that in the thumbsticks so mmm I

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.340 
see that in the thumbsticks so mmm I
think<00:02:03.270> I'm<00:02:03.330> gonna<00:02:03.420> have<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.690> make<00:02:03.840> sure<00:02:04.050> the

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
think I'm gonna have to make sure the

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.810 
think I'm gonna have to make sure the
controller<00:02:04.740> stays<00:02:05.040> clean<00:02:05.310> when<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.520> get<00:02:05.729> my

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
controller stays clean when I get my

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.449 
controller stays clean when I get my
hands<00:02:05.970> on<00:02:06.090> it<00:02:06.470> also<00:02:07.470> there<00:02:07.830> is<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.009> front

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
hands on it also there is a front

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.420 
hands on it also there is a front
touchpad<00:02:09.390> on<00:02:09.629> this<00:02:10.019> controller<00:02:10.470> in<00:02:10.709> my

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
touchpad on this controller in my

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.970 
touchpad on this controller in my
opinion<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.360> think<00:02:12.750> it's<00:02:13.440> a<00:02:13.500> bit<00:02:13.620> of<00:02:13.709> a<00:02:13.769> gimmick

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
opinion I think it's a bit of a gimmick

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.910 
opinion I think it's a bit of a gimmick
I<00:02:14.190> cannot<00:02:14.760> see<00:02:15.060> any<00:02:15.360> real-world<00:02:16.080> application

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
I cannot see any real-world application

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.190 
I cannot see any real-world application
of<00:02:17.040> this<00:02:17.220> I<00:02:17.400> can't<00:02:17.700> see<00:02:18.060> me<00:02:18.629> playing<00:02:18.870> call<00:02:19.170> of

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
of this I can't see me playing call of

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.400 
of this I can't see me playing call of
duty<00:02:19.349> or<00:02:19.769> any<00:02:19.920> other<00:02:20.129> top<00:02:20.400> line<00:02:20.610> title<00:02:21.060> and

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
duty or any other top line title and

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.490 
duty or any other top line title and
touching<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:23.730> little<00:02:24.390> touchpad<00:02:24.840> I<00:02:25.050> don't

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
touching the little touchpad I don't

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.750 
touching the little touchpad I don't
think<00:02:26.040> it

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
think it

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.789 
think it
going<00:02:26.970> to<00:02:27.090> serve<00:02:27.360> any<00:02:27.569> purpose<00:02:27.720> other<00:02:28.319> than<00:02:28.470> in

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
going to serve any purpose other than in

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:30.649 
going to serve any purpose other than in
the<00:02:28.890> menus<00:02:29.310> when<00:02:29.580> you're<00:02:29.700> swiping<00:02:29.970> side<00:02:30.450> to

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:30.659 
the menus when you're swiping side to

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:33.559 
the menus when you're swiping side to
side<00:02:30.900> I<00:02:31.430> don't<00:02:32.430> really<00:02:32.610> see<00:02:32.849> a<00:02:32.879> need<00:02:33.269> for<00:02:33.450> it

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
side I don't really see a need for it

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.440 
side I don't really see a need for it
and<00:02:33.689> I'll<00:02:34.319> get<00:02:34.500> like<00:02:35.340> it<00:02:35.549> annoys<00:02:35.970> me<00:02:36.090> for<00:02:36.420> a

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
and I'll get like it annoys me for a

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.030 
and I'll get like it annoys me for a
specific<00:02:36.659> reason<00:02:37.049> which<00:02:37.319> I'll<00:02:37.470> get<00:02:37.560> into<00:02:37.620> in<00:02:37.860> a

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
specific reason which I'll get into in a

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.190 
specific reason which I'll get into in a
minute<00:02:38.420> but<00:02:39.420> yeah<00:02:39.510> I<00:02:39.540> think<00:02:39.720> it's<00:02:39.989> pointless

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
minute but yeah I think it's pointless

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.649 
minute but yeah I think it's pointless
in<00:02:40.530> my<00:02:40.650> opinion<00:02:41.010> it's<00:02:41.250> I<00:02:41.640> don't<00:02:41.970> it<00:02:42.360> doesn't

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659 
in my opinion it's I don't it doesn't

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:44.089 
in my opinion it's I don't it doesn't
need<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:42.930> be<00:02:43.019> there<00:02:43.200> it<00:02:43.379> hasn't<00:02:43.709> been<00:02:43.769> on<00:02:43.890> any

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
need to be there it hasn't been on any

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.160 
need to be there it hasn't been on any
controller<00:02:44.579> before<00:02:44.819> and<00:02:45.329> another<00:02:45.930> thing<00:02:46.079> it

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
controller before and another thing it

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.360 
controller before and another thing it
needs<00:02:46.319> to<00:02:46.409> be<00:02:46.470> on<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.620> controller<00:02:46.950> now<00:02:47.129> and

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
needs to be on the controller now and

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.600 
needs to be on the controller now and
also<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.390> controller<00:02:49.110> has<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:49.620> front<00:02:50.040> speaker

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
also the controller has a front speaker

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.089 
also the controller has a front speaker
now<00:02:50.879> this<00:02:51.870> is<00:02:52.079> pointless<00:02:52.349> in<00:02:52.530> my<00:02:52.650> opinion<00:02:52.980> I

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
now this is pointless in my opinion I

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.220 
now this is pointless in my opinion I
don't<00:02:53.159> need<00:02:53.940> to<00:02:54.090> hear<00:02:54.329> sound<00:02:54.750> from<00:02:55.109> my

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
don't need to hear sound from my

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.550 
don't need to hear sound from my
controller<00:02:55.709> whilst<00:02:56.040> I'm<00:02:56.400> playing<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:56.909> game<00:02:57.560> the

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
controller whilst I'm playing a game the

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.259 
controller whilst I'm playing a game the
thing<00:02:58.769> is<00:02:58.980> when<00:02:59.280> I'm<00:02:59.400> playing<00:02:59.609> a<00:02:59.790> game<00:03:00.000> I'm

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
thing is when I'm playing a game I'm

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.210 
thing is when I'm playing a game I'm
fully<00:03:00.510> immersed<00:03:00.930> in<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.319> environment<00:03:01.859> on<00:03:02.010> the

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
fully immersed in the environment on the

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.509 
fully immersed in the environment on the
screen<00:03:02.640> and<00:03:02.900> I'm<00:03:03.900> listening<00:03:04.560> to<00:03:04.799> audio<00:03:05.250> either

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
screen and I'm listening to audio either

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.430 
screen and I'm listening to audio either
with<00:03:05.760> headphones<00:03:06.000> or<00:03:06.480> from<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.810> TV<00:03:07.109> itself

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
with headphones or from the TV itself

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.920 
with headphones or from the TV itself
the<00:03:08.040> last<00:03:08.310> thing<00:03:08.670> I<00:03:08.790> want<00:03:09.060> is<00:03:09.180> a<00:03:09.269> crappy

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
the last thing I want is a crappy

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.740 
the last thing I want is a crappy
speaker<00:03:10.500> from<00:03:10.799> this<00:03:11.090> controller<00:03:12.090> in<00:03:12.329> my<00:03:12.450> hands

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
speaker from this controller in my hands

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.629 
speaker from this controller in my hands
to<00:03:13.079> go<00:03:13.230> off<00:03:13.379> because<00:03:13.829> all<00:03:14.069> it's<00:03:14.280> going<00:03:14.340> to<00:03:14.489> do

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:14.639 
to go off because all it's going to do

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:16.789 
to go off because all it's going to do
is<00:03:14.940> remind<00:03:15.569> me<00:03:15.870> that<00:03:15.900> I'm<00:03:16.230> not<00:03:16.440> in<00:03:16.650> that

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
is remind me that I'm not in that

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.259 
is remind me that I'm not in that
environment<00:03:17.459> I'm<00:03:17.579> sitting<00:03:17.879> in<00:03:18.000> my<00:03:18.120> living

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
environment I'm sitting in my living

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.319 
environment I'm sitting in my living
room<00:03:18.480> playing<00:03:18.840> on<00:03:19.079> my<00:03:19.170> playstation<00:03:19.730> it's<00:03:20.730> it

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
room playing on my playstation it's it

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.479 
room playing on my playstation it's it
doesn't<00:03:21.750> make<00:03:21.870> sense<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.769> I<00:03:22.950> can't<00:03:23.280> imagine

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
doesn't make sense and I can't imagine

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.729 
doesn't make sense and I can't imagine
anything<00:03:24.180> useful<00:03:24.389> coming<00:03:24.840> out<00:03:24.959> of<00:03:25.079> it<00:03:25.200> the

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
anything useful coming out of it the

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.819 
anything useful coming out of it the
rumble<00:03:26.129> feature<00:03:26.280> yes<00:03:27.120> cool<00:03:27.780> I<00:03:28.049> like<00:03:28.409> it<00:03:28.440> it's

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
rumble feature yes cool I like it it's

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.710 
rumble feature yes cool I like it it's
good<00:03:30.169> speakers<00:03:31.169> I'm<00:03:31.379> not<00:03:31.889> I'm<00:03:32.010> not<00:03:32.160> feeling<00:03:32.549> it

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
good speakers I'm not I'm not feeling it

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.939 
good speakers I'm not I'm not feeling it
that's<00:03:33.720> also<00:03:34.079> pointless<00:03:34.440> in<00:03:34.530> my<00:03:34.620> opinion

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:34.949 
that's also pointless in my opinion

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:36.379 
that's also pointless in my opinion
there's<00:03:35.129> the<00:03:35.250> only<00:03:35.459> two<00:03:35.639> things<00:03:35.849> I<00:03:36.030> don't<00:03:36.060> like

button which I'll talk about in another

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.390 
button which I'll talk about in another
video<00:03:49.049> that<00:03:49.349> is<00:03:49.500> a<00:03:49.530> new<00:03:49.889> part<00:03:50.220> of<00:03:50.340> the

00:03:59.659 --> 00:03:59.669 
it's compatible with you know if you buy

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:03.319 
it's compatible with you know if you buy
an<00:03:59.819> iPhone<00:04:00.349> in<00:04:01.349> the<00:04:01.560> iPhone<00:04:01.980> headphones<00:04:02.329> you

comment section below is it's likely
it's<00:04:57.539> really<00:04:58.050> likely<00:04:58.620> going<00:04:58.949> to<00:04:59.100> be<00:04:59.220> the<00:04:59.400> most

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789 
it's really likely going to be the most

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:01.850 
it's really likely going to be the most
expensive<00:05:00.090> controller<00:05:00.810> that<00:05:01.169> we've<00:05:01.350> had<00:05:01.590> ever

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
expensive controller that we've had ever

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.450 
expensive controller that we've had ever
I<00:05:02.660> really<00:05:03.660> do<00:05:04.289> think<00:05:04.500> I<00:05:04.680> mean<00:05:04.919> think<00:05:05.160> about<00:05:05.220> it

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
I really do think I mean think about it

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.510 
I really do think I mean think about it
it's<00:05:05.580> got<00:05:05.729> a<00:05:05.789> touchpad<00:05:06.090> it's<00:05:06.750> got<00:05:07.560> this<00:05:08.100> front

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
it's got a touchpad it's got this front

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.090 
it's got a touchpad it's got this front
speaker<00:05:09.150> it's<00:05:09.690> got<00:05:09.990> a<00:05:10.020> headphone<00:05:10.530> jack<00:05:10.590> I

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
speaker it's got a headphone jack I

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.590 
speaker it's got a headphone jack I
think<00:05:11.669> they're<00:05:11.789> really<00:05:12.060> going<00:05:12.389> to<00:05:12.449> put<00:05:12.570> a

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
think they're really going to put a

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.540 
think they're really going to put a
premium<00:05:12.900> on<00:05:13.289> this<00:05:13.620> controller<00:05:14.039> and<00:05:14.280> I<00:05:14.310> think

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
premium on this controller and I think

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:15.770 
premium on this controller and I think
it's<00:05:14.699> where<00:05:14.849> a<00:05:14.880> lot<00:05:15.120> of<00:05:15.150> the<00:05:15.300> money<00:05:15.479> is<00:05:15.599> going

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
it's where a lot of the money is going
