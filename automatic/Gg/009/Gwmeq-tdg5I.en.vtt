the<00:00:31.800> two<00:00:31.949> photos<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.520> was<00:00:32.609> possible<00:00:33.180> to

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
the two photos it was possible to

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.779 
the two photos it was possible to
determine<00:00:33.690> where<00:00:34.170> he<00:00:34.350> stood<00:00:34.649> where<00:00:35.280> mr.<00:00:35.520> Trent

00:00:35.779 --> 00:00:35.789 
determine where he stood where mr. Trent

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:38.209 
determine where he stood where mr. Trent
stood<00:00:36.120> when<00:00:36.300> he<00:00:36.359> took<00:00:36.539> the<00:00:36.629> two<00:00:36.780> photos<00:00:37.100> -<00:00:38.100> with

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
stood when he took the two photos - with

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.459 
stood when he took the two photos - with
an<00:00:38.339> accuracy<00:00:38.699> of<00:00:38.909> a<00:00:38.969> foot<00:00:39.179> or<00:00:39.300> so<00:00:39.329> so<00:00:40.319> if<00:00:40.379> you

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
an accuracy of a foot or so so if you

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.309 
an accuracy of a foot or so so if you
imagine<00:00:40.559> looking<00:00:41.280> down<00:00:41.489> from<00:00:41.789> above<00:00:42.139> you<00:00:43.139> can

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:43.319 
imagine looking down from above you can

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:45.349 
imagine looking down from above you can
plot<00:00:43.530> where<00:00:43.800> he<00:00:43.949> was<00:00:44.100> standing<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:45.089> where<00:00:45.239> the

00:00:45.349 --> 00:00:45.359 
plot where he was standing and where the

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:47.419 
plot where he was standing and where the
sighting<00:00:45.690> lines<00:00:45.899> went<00:00:46.170> out<00:00:46.319> and<00:00:46.949> they<00:00:47.190> said

00:00:47.419 --> 00:00:47.429 
sighting lines went out and they said

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:50.389 
sighting lines went out and they said
that<00:00:47.579> this<00:00:47.729> object<00:00:47.999> moved<00:00:48.799> to<00:00:49.799> the<00:00:49.920> left<00:00:50.129> move

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
that this object moved to the left move

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.770 
that this object moved to the left move
southward<00:00:50.909> as<00:00:51.030> they're<00:00:51.179> looking<00:00:51.299> towards<00:00:51.719> the

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
southward as they're looking towards the

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.959 
southward as they're looking towards the
west<00:00:52.019> it<00:00:52.649> moves<00:00:52.949> slightly<00:00:53.190> between<00:00:53.460> pictures

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
west it moves slightly between pictures

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.349 
west it moves slightly between pictures
and<00:00:54.769> in<00:00:55.769> fact<00:00:56.039> he<00:00:56.309> was<00:00:56.519> standing<00:00:57.149> in<00:00:57.239> one

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:57.359 
and in fact he was standing in one

00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:59.119 
and in fact he was standing in one
location<00:00:57.719> for<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.139> first<00:00:58.289> photo<00:00:58.620> looking<00:00:59.010> to

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
location for the first photo looking to

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.639 
location for the first photo looking to
say<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.489> way<00:00:59.639> and<00:00:59.940> then<00:01:00.600> he<00:01:00.989> moved<00:01:01.229> a<00:01:01.469> little

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
say this way and then he moved a little

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.369 
say this way and then he moved a little
bit<00:01:01.889> to<00:01:02.549> the<00:01:02.639> north<00:01:02.670> as<00:01:03.239> this<00:01:03.929> object<00:01:04.140> was

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
bit to the north as this object was

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.990 
bit to the north as this object was
traveling<00:01:04.769> along<00:01:05.010> he<00:01:05.250> didn't<00:01:05.580> want<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.820> get

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
traveling along he didn't want to get

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.120 
traveling along he didn't want to get
blocked<00:01:06.240> by<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.540> nearby<00:01:07.200> garage<00:01:07.440> so<00:01:07.830> he<00:01:07.950> moved

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
blocked by the nearby garage so he moved

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.310 
blocked by the nearby garage so he moved
a<00:01:08.190> little<00:01:08.250> bit<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.580> his<00:01:08.820> right<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.360> then<00:01:10.230> he

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
a little bit to his right and then he

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.290 
a little bit to his right and then he
looked<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.800> took<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.460> photo<00:01:11.670> was<00:01:11.970> in<00:01:12.060> this<00:01:12.150> way

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
looked and took a photo was in this way

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.550 
looked and took a photo was in this way
and<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.510> sighting<00:01:12.750> lines<00:01:12.870> crossed

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
and the sighting lines crossed

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.430 
and the sighting lines crossed
now<00:01:14.160> the<00:01:14.220> overhead<00:01:14.760> wires<00:01:15.000> can<00:01:15.510> be<00:01:15.540> positioned

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
now the overhead wires can be positioned

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.610 
now the overhead wires can be positioned
where<00:01:16.590> they<00:01:16.740> were<00:01:16.800> and<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:19.170> sighting<00:01:19.440> lines

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:19.620 
where they were and the sighting lines

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.890 
where they were and the sighting lines
did<00:01:19.800> not<00:01:19.920> cross<00:01:20.190> under<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.580> wires<00:01:20.790> so<00:01:21.570> you

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
did not cross under the wires so you

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.690 
did not cross under the wires so you
know<00:01:22.080> if<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.470> was<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.620> model<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.160> wasn't<00:01:23.430> hanging

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
know if it was a model it wasn't hanging

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.480 
know if it was a model it wasn't hanging
straight<00:01:23.940> down<00:01:24.000> under<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.510> wire<00:01:25.250> the<00:01:26.250> two

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
straight down under the wire the two

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.750 
straight down under the wire the two
photographs<00:01:27.210> taken<00:01:27.690> by<00:01:28.080> Paul<00:01:28.350> Trent<00:01:28.760> provided

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
photographs taken by Paul Trent provided

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.450 
photographs taken by Paul Trent provided
a<00:01:29.850> stereoscopic<00:01:30.720> pair<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.320> pictures<00:01:31.830> that

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
a stereoscopic pair of pictures that

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.480 
a stereoscopic pair of pictures that
gave<00:01:32.760> researchers<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.810> data<00:01:34.050> necessary<00:01:34.490> to

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
gave researchers the data necessary to

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.760 
gave researchers the data necessary to
determine<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.360> measure<00:01:36.630> distances<00:01:37.530> to

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
determine and measure distances to

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.610 
determine and measure distances to
objects<00:01:38.730> within<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.510> short<00:01:39.810> range<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.500> the

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:40.620 
objects within a short range of the

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.180 
objects within a short range of the
camera<00:01:41.270> his<00:01:42.270> altitude<00:01:42.780> or<00:01:43.440> the<00:01:43.530> altitude<00:01:43.950> of

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
camera his altitude or the altitude of

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.760 
camera his altitude or the altitude of
the<00:01:44.250> camera<00:01:44.760> also<00:01:45.240> dropped<00:01:45.870> by<00:01:46.140> about<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.440> foot

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
the camera also dropped by about a foot

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.930 
the camera also dropped by about a foot
so<00:01:47.460> not<00:01:47.610> only<00:01:47.790> do<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.030> have<00:01:48.120> a<00:01:48.510> horizontal

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
so not only do you have a horizontal

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.710 
so not only do you have a horizontal
triangulation<00:01:50.940> method<00:01:50.970> but<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.480> have<00:01:51.690> a

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
triangulation method but you have a

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.770 
triangulation method but you have a
vertical<00:01:52.100> triangulation<00:01:53.100> method<00:01:53.570> now<00:01:54.570> when

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
vertical triangulation method now when

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.420 
vertical triangulation method now when
you<00:01:54.840> combine<00:01:55.260> those<00:01:55.500> two<00:01:55.800> methods<00:01:56.310> of

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
you combine those two methods of

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.000 
you combine those two methods of
distance<00:01:57.240> determination<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.560> can<00:01:58.710> determine

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
distance determination you can determine

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.480 
distance determination you can determine
the<00:01:59.250> distance<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.940> every<00:02:00.800> short-range<00:02:01.800> object

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
the distance to every short-range object

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.420 
the distance to every short-range object
in<00:02:02.640> those<00:02:02.909> photos<00:02:03.330> and<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:04.200> UFO<00:02:04.650> model<00:02:05.190> if

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
in those photos and the UFO model if

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.180 
in those photos and the UFO model if
that's<00:02:05.670> what<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:05.970> was<00:02:06.000> does<00:02:06.540> not<00:02:06.720> fit<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:07.350> is

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
that's what it was does not fit it is
