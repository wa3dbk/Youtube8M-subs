00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
say there's maybe five to ten percent

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.410 
say there's maybe five to ten percent
chance<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:39.590> getting<00:00:40.590> this<00:00:40.739> dragon<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.420> just

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
chance of getting this dragon it just

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.340 
chance of getting this dragon it just
like<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:44.360> get<00:00:45.360> this<00:00:45.539> number<00:00:45.750> from<00:00:46.200> a

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
like that and I get this number from a

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.560 
like that and I get this number from a
number<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.770> breeding<00:00:47.039> games<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.760> kind<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.120> you

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
number of breeding games and kind of you

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.360 
number of breeding games and kind of you
kind<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.840> get<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:48.989> feel<00:00:49.440> for<00:00:49.469> breeding<00:00:50.070> games

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
kind of get a feel for breeding games

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.369 
kind of get a feel for breeding games
when<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.670> play<00:00:50.879> more<00:00:51.420> than<00:00:51.629> one<00:00:51.870> more<00:00:52.199> than

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
when you play more than one more than

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.430 
when you play more than one more than
five<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.920> kind<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.489> get<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:54.329> breathing<00:00:54.660> rate

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
five you kind of get the breathing rate

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.130 
five you kind of get the breathing rate
and<00:00:55.739> I'm<00:00:56.699> just<00:00:57.030> gonna<00:00:57.149> give<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.390> ballpark

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
and I'm just gonna give that ballpark

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.599 
and I'm just gonna give that ballpark
number<00:00:58.469> out<00:00:58.590> there<00:00:58.800> it's<00:00:58.920> definitely<00:00:59.129> not

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
number out there it's definitely not

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.340 
number out there it's definitely not
like<00:00:59.820> thirty<00:01:00.750> percent<00:01:01.289> because<00:01:01.859> uh<00:01:02.989> it's<00:01:03.989> not

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
like thirty percent because uh it's not

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.620 
like thirty percent because uh it's not
only<00:01:04.769> taking<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.250> while<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.519> mean<00:01:05.970> it's<00:01:06.240> taking<00:01:06.570> a

only taking a while I mean it's taking a

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.130 
only taking a while I mean it's taking a
long<00:01:06.900> while<00:01:07.760> anyways<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:08.939> dragon<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.510> really

in a way but maybe not as big I'm not

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.050 
in a way but maybe not as big I'm not
I'm<00:01:27.390> not<00:01:27.630> really<00:01:27.840> sure<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.530> but<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.670> know<00:01:29.790> it's

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
I'm not really sure it but you know it's

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.800

like that

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.030 
like that
and<00:01:30.920> as<00:01:31.920> we<00:01:32.640> level<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.060> up<00:01:33.240> as<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.689> can<00:01:33.720> see

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
and as we level it up as you can see

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.080 
and as we level it up as you can see
somewhere<00:01:35.040> around<00:01:35.130> five<00:01:35.490> thousand<00:01:35.970> six

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
somewhere around five thousand six

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.590 
somewhere around five thousand six
hundred<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.600> forty<00:01:36.920> gold<00:01:37.920> per<00:01:38.549> hour<00:01:38.729> at<00:01:39.299> level

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
hundred and forty gold per hour at level

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.780 
hundred and forty gold per hour at level
nine

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
nine

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.660 
nine
now<00:01:41.790> like<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:42.689> said<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.200> dragon<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.860> ultra<00:01:44.640> rare

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
now like I said the dragon is ultra rare

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.429 
now like I said the dragon is ultra rare
which<00:01:45.240> means<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:46.079> um<00:01:47.240> even<00:01:48.240> given<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.259> have

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
which means that um even given you have

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.389 
which means that um even given you have
the<00:01:49.619> combination<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:50.250> don't<00:01:50.490> don't<00:01:50.820> take<00:01:51.149> those

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
the combination I don't don't take those

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.370 
the combination I don't don't take those
increase<00:01:53.399> in<00:01:53.670> breeding<00:01:54.210> percent<00:01:54.720> into

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
increase in breeding percent into

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.319 
increase in breeding percent into
consideration<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.310> mean<00:01:56.490> if<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:57.360> have<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:58.310> 30%

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
consideration I mean if you have a 30%

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:03.980 
consideration I mean if you have a 30%
increase<00:02:00.329> in<00:02:00.360> breeding<00:02:01.110> rare<00:02:01.320> dragons<00:02:01.920> at<00:02:02.990> 1%

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
increase in breeding rare dragons at 1%

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.350 
increase in breeding rare dragons at 1%
that's<00:02:04.979> like<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:06.500> 0.03<00:02:07.500> percent<00:02:07.640> increase<00:02:08.640> you

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
that's like a 0.03 percent increase you

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.580 
that's like a 0.03 percent increase you
kind<00:02:09.569> of<00:02:09.599> get<00:02:09.780> what<00:02:09.810> I'm<00:02:10.020> saying<00:02:10.289> you're<00:02:10.470> not

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
kind of get what I'm saying you're not

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.370 
kind of get what I'm saying you're not
you're<00:02:10.830> increase<00:02:11.370> is<00:02:11.580> not<00:02:11.819> that<00:02:12.209> big

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
you're increase is not that big

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.250 
you're increase is not that big
I<00:02:13.640> because<00:02:14.640> it's<00:02:14.880> not<00:02:15.060> increasing<00:02:15.540> by<00:02:15.840> 30%

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
I because it's not increasing by 30%

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.060 
I because it's not increasing by 30%
it's<00:02:17.210> it's<00:02:18.210> increasing<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.260> percent<00:02:19.710> based

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
it's it's increasing the percent based

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.160 
it's it's increasing the percent based
on<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.400> percent<00:02:20.910> that's<00:02:21.090> set<00:02:21.360> by<00:02:21.390> developers

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
on the percent that's set by developers

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.900 
on the percent that's set by developers
I<00:02:22.290> believe<00:02:22.560> that's<00:02:22.950> what<00:02:23.100> I<00:02:23.130> believe<00:02:23.460> but

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
I believe that's what I believe but

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.660 
I believe that's what I believe but
anyways<00:02:24.170> we<00:02:25.170> use<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.590> river<00:02:25.860> dragon<00:02:26.310> here<00:02:26.520> and

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
anyways we use the river dragon here and

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.940 
anyways we use the river dragon here and
the<00:02:26.760> lava<00:02:26.940> dragon<00:02:27.540> what<00:02:27.720> we<00:02:27.840> got<00:02:27.990> is<00:02:28.170> 18<00:02:28.830> hours

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
the lava dragon what we got is 18 hours

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.610 
the lava dragon what we got is 18 hours
you<00:02:29.610> can<00:02:29.730> use<00:02:29.940> any<00:02:30.150> combination<00:02:30.870> with<00:02:31.470> the

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
you can use any combination with the

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.460 
you can use any combination with the
elements<00:02:32.070> of<00:02:32.160> fire<00:02:32.460> earth<00:02:32.760> and<00:02:33.240> water<00:02:33.630> but

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
elements of fire earth and water but

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.980 
elements of fire earth and water but
this<00:02:34.770> combination<00:02:35.040> has<00:02:35.790> proven<00:02:36.300> to<00:02:36.540> work<00:02:36.720> for

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
this combination has proven to work for

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.470 
this combination has proven to work for
me<00:02:37.140> personally<00:02:37.410> I'm<00:02:38.190> not<00:02:38.250> sure<00:02:38.730> if<00:02:39.030> it<00:02:39.330> will

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
me personally I'm not sure if it will

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.200 
me personally I'm not sure if it will
work<00:02:39.720> for<00:02:39.960> you<00:02:40.320> and<00:02:40.560> why<00:02:41.220> we<00:02:41.430> use<00:02:41.460> this<00:02:41.910> is

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
work for you and why we use this is

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.500 
work for you and why we use this is
because<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:44.400> other<00:02:44.430> combination<00:02:45.180> wasn't

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
because the other combination wasn't

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.140 
because the other combination wasn't
working<00:02:45.870> so<00:02:45.920> we<00:02:46.920> selected<00:02:47.430> a<00:02:47.490> combination

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
working so we selected a combination

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.680 
working so we selected a combination
that<00:02:48.360> only<00:02:48.540> had<00:02:48.840> water<00:02:49.620> fire<00:02:50.610> and<00:02:50.940> earth<00:02:51.480> and

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
that only had water fire and earth and

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.830 
that only had water fire and earth and
that's<00:02:52.230> what<00:02:52.470> it<00:02:52.590> had<00:02:52.830> here<00:02:53.280> and<00:02:53.810> we're<00:02:54.810> just

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
that's what it had here and we're just

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.180 
that's what it had here and we're just
going<00:02:55.230> to<00:02:55.260> hatch<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:57.020> pretty<00:02:58.020> soon<00:02:58.290> but<00:02:58.770> like<00:02:59.070> I
