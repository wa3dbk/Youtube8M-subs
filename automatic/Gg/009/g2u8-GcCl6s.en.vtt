object can we say it is Nibiru of course
many<00:02:04.760> believers<00:02:05.060> will<00:02:05.300> say<00:02:05.480> yes<00:02:05.720> it<00:02:06.020> is<00:02:06.170> Nibiru

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530

many believers will say yes it is Nibiru
okay<00:02:07.490> it<00:02:07.580> doesn't<00:02:07.760> have<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.030> wings<00:02:08.300> they<00:02:08.569> said

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
okay it doesn't have the wings they said

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.660 
okay it doesn't have the wings they said
I<00:02:08.810> did<00:02:09.080> all<00:02:09.319> the<00:02:09.530> planets<00:02:09.890> orbiting<00:02:10.280> around<00:02:10.369> it

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
I did all the planets orbiting around it

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.720

orbit around our Sun and it was a

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.500 
orbit around our Sun and it was a
slightly<00:02:16.160> different<00:02:16.400> type<00:02:16.670> of<00:02:16.700> star<00:02:17.150> and

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
wasn't found where we said it would be

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:20.860 
wasn't found where we said it would be

Nibiru the believers were

Nibiru the believers were
right<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:26.840> problems<00:02:27.200> that<00:02:27.230> believers<00:02:27.560> don't

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
right the problems that believers don't

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.470 
right the problems that believers don't
really<00:02:28.430> have<00:02:28.580> much<00:02:28.730> of<00:02:28.760> an<00:02:28.970> idea<00:02:29.060> of<00:02:29.300> what

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
really have much of an idea of what

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.720 
really have much of an idea of what
Nibiru<00:02:29.810> actually<00:02:30.080> is<00:02:30.530> partly<00:02:31.250> because<00:02:31.459> they

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
Nibiru actually is partly because they

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.309 
Nibiru actually is partly because they

here<00:02:35.780> is<00:02:35.900> a<00:02:35.930> question<00:02:36.349> to<00:02:36.530> believers<00:02:36.800> if<00:02:37.400> you

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
here is a question to believers if you

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.059 
here is a question to believers if you
know<00:02:38.239> Niburu<00:02:38.630> exists<00:02:39.230> why<00:02:39.709> aren't<00:02:39.980> you

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
know Niburu exists why aren't you

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.280 
know Niburu exists why aren't you
sharing<00:02:40.310> your<00:02:40.550> knowledge<00:02:40.840> why<00:02:41.840> aren't<00:02:42.170> you

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
sharing your knowledge why aren't you

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.020 
sharing your knowledge why aren't you
telling<00:02:42.500> scientists<00:02:43.250> exactly<00:02:43.730> where<00:02:43.880> to

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
telling scientists exactly where to

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.000 
telling scientists exactly where to
point<00:02:44.209> their<00:02:44.450> equipment<00:02:44.900> why<00:02:45.650> aren't<00:02:45.920> you

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
point their equipment why aren't you

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.160 
point their equipment why aren't you
backing<00:02:46.430> their<00:02:46.580> efforts<00:02:46.970> or<00:02:47.390> proposing<00:02:47.989> new

ones<00:02:48.410> why<00:02:49.340> are<00:02:49.400> you<00:02:49.580> just<00:02:49.819> sat<00:02:50.120> on<00:02:50.150> the

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
ones why are you just sat on the

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.780 
ones why are you just sat on the
Internet<00:02:50.810> reshaping<00:02:51.470> new<00:02:51.830> discoveries<00:02:52.459> so

Internet reshaping new discoveries so

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.610 
Internet reshaping new discoveries so
that<00:02:52.940> they<00:02:53.060> fit<00:02:53.269> neatly<00:02:53.510> into<00:02:53.720> your<00:02:54.200> vision

that they fit neatly into your vision

minutes if you think niburu exists prove

minutes if you think niburu exists prove
it<00:03:00.290> please<00:03:00.890> offer<00:03:01.250> us<00:03:01.670> some<00:03:01.850> evidence<00:03:02.209> that<00:03:02.300> we

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
it please offer us some evidence that we

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.229 
it please offer us some evidence that we
can<00:03:02.690> test<00:03:02.930> if<00:03:03.709> we<00:03:03.980> reach<00:03:04.190> the<00:03:04.400> same<00:03:04.640> conclusion

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
can test if we reach the same conclusion

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.240 
can test if we reach the same conclusion
we<00:03:05.720> advanced<00:03:06.080> science<00:03:06.620> that<00:03:06.799> little<00:03:07.100> bit

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
we advanced science that little bit

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.160 
we advanced science that little bit
further<00:03:07.459> if<00:03:08.299> we<00:03:08.450> don't<00:03:08.660> reach<00:03:08.840> the<00:03:08.989> same

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
further if we don't reach the same

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.320 
further if we don't reach the same
conclusion<00:03:09.709> well<00:03:10.010> we<00:03:10.160> still<00:03:10.430> learn<00:03:10.610> we<00:03:11.299> learn

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
conclusion well we still learn we learn

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.000 
conclusion well we still learn we learn
that<00:03:11.569> something<00:03:11.930> isn't<00:03:12.080> quite<00:03:12.319> right<00:03:12.440> or<00:03:12.950> that

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
that something isn't quite right or that

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.309 
that something isn't quite right or that
something<00:03:13.430> is<00:03:13.640> flat-out<00:03:13.910> wrong<00:03:14.299> but<00:03:15.110> we<00:03:15.200> all

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
something is flat-out wrong but we all

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:16.990 
something is flat-out wrong but we all
know<00:03:15.470> why<00:03:15.650> no<00:03:15.890> proof<00:03:16.220> has<00:03:16.430> been<00:03:16.580> offered<00:03:16.850> up

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
know why no proof has been offered up

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.809 
know why no proof has been offered up
don't<00:03:17.390> we<00:03:17.510> nobody<00:03:18.500> has<00:03:18.739> it<00:03:18.920> and<00:03:19.310> until<00:03:19.549> we<00:03:19.700> can

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
don't we nobody has it and until we can

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:21.789 
don't we nobody has it and until we can
say<00:03:20.000> so<00:03:20.060> either<00:03:20.450> way<00:03:20.750> all<00:03:21.170> we<00:03:21.440> have<00:03:21.620> is<00:03:21.650> a

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
say so either way all we have is a

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:27.310 
say so either way all we have is a
hypothesis<00:03:22.519> all<00:03:23.330> Niburu<00:03:23.840> is<00:03:24.200> is<00:03:24.500> an<00:03:24.920> idea
