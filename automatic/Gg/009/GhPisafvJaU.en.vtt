image<00:00:54.960> or<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.680> shell<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.730> believe<00:00:57.149> this<00:00:57.300> was<00:00:57.539> a

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
image or a shell I believe this was a

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.020 
image or a shell I believe this was a
shell<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:59.160> I've<00:00:59.250> got<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.520> world<00:00:59.670> clock

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
shell so I've got the world clock

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.639 
shell so I've got the world clock
position<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.809> don't<00:01:00.960> really<00:01:01.079> need<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.440> set

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
position you don't really need to set

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.619 
position you don't really need to set
those<00:01:01.829> unless<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.309> drag<00:01:02.609> this<00:01:02.820> it's<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.420> part

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
those unless you drag this it's a part

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.030 
those unless you drag this it's a part
of<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.780> default<00:01:04.199> group<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.710> can<00:01:04.830> create

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
of a default group you can create

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.620 
of a default group you can create
different<00:01:05.159> groups<00:01:05.610> turn<00:01:05.909> those<00:01:06.119> groups<00:01:06.390> on

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
different groups turn those groups on

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.410 
different groups turn those groups on
and<00:01:06.840> off<00:01:06.930> etc<00:01:07.650> but<00:01:08.310> basically<00:01:08.729> right<00:01:08.880> here<00:01:09.330> is

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
and off etc but basically right here is

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.420 
and off etc but basically right here is
what<00:01:09.600> we're<00:01:09.720> looking<00:01:10.049> at<00:01:10.200> this<00:01:10.439> command<00:01:11.040> right

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
what we're looking at this command right

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.219 
what we're looking at this command right
here<00:01:11.760> where<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.030> can<00:01:12.180> see<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:12.780> am<00:01:13.020> running

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
here where you can see that I am running

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.530 
here where you can see that I am running
a<00:01:13.619> command<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:14.790> something<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.390> you

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
a command that is something that you

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.289 
a command that is something that you
would<00:01:15.659> normally<00:01:16.200> do<00:01:16.409> in<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:17.250> terminal<00:01:17.759> so<00:01:18.090> if

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
would normally do in the terminal so if

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.510 
would normally do in the terminal so if
this<00:01:18.479> scares<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.990> don't<00:01:19.710> use<00:01:19.890> this<00:01:20.100> technique

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
this scares you don't use this technique

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.550 
this scares you don't use this technique
otherwise<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.810> should<00:01:22.110> be<00:01:22.290> pretty

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
otherwise it should be pretty

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.590 
otherwise it should be pretty
straightforward<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.369> here<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.240> it's

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
straightforward and here it is it's

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.270 
straightforward and here it is it's
basically<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:25.170> script<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.619> forget<00:01:25.890> where<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.070> got

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
basically a script I forget where I got

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.210 
basically a script I forget where I got
the<00:01:26.430> original<00:01:26.759> script<00:01:27.740> but<00:01:28.740> basically<00:01:29.100> I

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
the original script but basically I

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.950 
the original script but basically I
modified<00:01:29.820> something<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.360> might<00:01:30.540> have<00:01:30.659> found<00:01:30.780> it

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
modified something I might have found it

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.980
