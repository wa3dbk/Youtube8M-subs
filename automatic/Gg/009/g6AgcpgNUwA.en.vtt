has the Musti Cartier range in the

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.069 
has the Musti Cartier range in the
Cartier<00:01:47.460> range<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:48.000> prefer<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.840> cutter

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
Cartier range I prefer the the cutter

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.929 
Cartier range I prefer the the cutter
year<00:01:49.380> range<00:01:49.649> because<00:01:50.070> they're<00:01:50.369> basically<00:01:50.610> a

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
year range because they're basically a

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.050 
year range because they're basically a
solid<00:01:51.210> gold<00:01:51.659> piece<00:01:52.049> as<00:01:52.340> opposed<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.640> a

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
solid gold piece as opposed to a a

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.490 
solid gold piece as opposed to a a
gold-plated<00:01:54.659> piece<00:01:55.520> so<00:01:56.520> that's<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.820> Cartier

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
gold-plated piece so that's the Cartier

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.030 
gold-plated piece so that's the Cartier
Center<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:59.570> I'll<00:02:00.570> just<00:02:00.780> I'll<00:02:01.259> just<00:02:01.320> open<00:02:01.740> the

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
back here

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.080 
back here
so<00:02:04.380> on<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.680> back<00:02:04.890> itself<00:02:05.310> there<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.909> can

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
so on the back itself there you can

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.680 
so on the back itself there you can
actually<00:02:06.509> see<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:08.190> has<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:09.390> says
