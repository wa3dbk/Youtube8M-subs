00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
this a little bit better in my opinion

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.400 
this a little bit better in my opinion
because<00:02:08.340> i'm<00:02:08.610> kind<00:02:09.060> of<00:02:09.149> like<00:02:09.360> not<00:02:09.750> seeing<00:02:10.170> it

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
because i'm kind of like not seeing it

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.470 
because i'm kind of like not seeing it
so<00:02:10.709> at<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.920> end<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.160> chapter<00:02:11.480> supposedly

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
so at the end of the chapter supposedly

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.400 
so at the end of the chapter supposedly
I<00:02:12.810> sure

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
I sure

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.680 
I sure
Rama<00:02:13.530> was<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:13.950> one<00:02:14.130> that<00:02:14.310> killed<00:02:14.640> mudarra<00:02:15.240> but

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
Rama was the one that killed mudarra but

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.140 
Rama was the one that killed mudarra but
he<00:02:16.050> fairly<00:02:16.350> survived<00:02:16.800> that<00:02:17.100> fight<00:02:17.610> but<00:02:18.000> I

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
he fairly survived that fight but I

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.430 
he fairly survived that fight but I
don't<00:02:18.300> think<00:02:18.450> that<00:02:18.510> I<00:02:18.630> should<00:02:18.780> I'm<00:02:19.020> would<00:02:19.290> just

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
don't think that I should I'm would just

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.800 
don't think that I should I'm would just
leave<00:02:19.740> his<00:02:19.950> dead<00:02:20.190> body<00:02:20.430> there<00:02:20.850> after<00:02:21.450> he<00:02:21.630> would

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
leave his dead body there after he would

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.810 
leave his dead body there after he would
have<00:02:21.960> killed<00:02:22.260> him<00:02:22.530> somehow<00:02:22.950> madera<00:02:23.550> was

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
have killed him somehow madera was

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.360 
have killed him somehow madera was
either<00:02:24.000> revived<00:02:24.570> or<00:02:24.930> he<00:02:25.230> probably<00:02:25.710> used<00:02:26.040> some

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
either revived or he probably used some

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.010 
either revived or he probably used some
in<00:02:26.610> some<00:02:26.850> sort<00:02:27.090> of<00:02:27.180> way<00:02:27.240> high<00:02:27.810> on<00:02:27.900> my

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
in some sort of way high on my

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.020 
in some sort of way high on my
cells<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.470> save<00:02:28.800> himself<00:02:29.040> from<00:02:29.370> that<00:02:29.520> so<00:02:29.970> I'm

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
cells to save himself from that so I'm

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.340 
cells to save himself from that so I'm
