applications<00:00:35.450> machines<00:00:36.450> gonna<00:00:36.570> talk<00:00:36.809> a

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
applications machines gonna talk a

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.360 
applications machines gonna talk a
little<00:00:37.110> bit<00:00:37.320> how<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.620> works<00:00:38.360> um<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:39.840> basically

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
little bit how it works um so basically

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.619 
little bit how it works um so basically
when<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.399> open<00:00:41.700> up<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.879> app<00:00:44.120> you<00:00:45.120> there<00:00:45.539> are

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
when you open up the app you there are

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.930 
when you open up the app you there are
three<00:00:45.809> gestures<00:00:46.140> there's<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.579> x-axis<00:00:47.579> treasure

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
three gestures there's a x-axis treasure

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.600 
three gestures there's a x-axis treasure
a<00:00:48.149> y-axis<00:00:48.390> gesture<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:50.039> action<00:00:50.430> session

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
a y-axis gesture is that action session

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.360 
a y-axis gesture is that action session
or<00:00:51.059> z<00:00:51.270> axis<00:00:53.600> so<00:00:54.600> for<00:00:55.230> each<00:00:55.680> gesture<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.190> can

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
or z axis so for each gesture you can

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.689 
or z axis so for each gesture you can
select<00:00:56.640> an<00:00:56.879> application<00:00:57.829> of<00:00:58.829> any<00:00:59.039> application

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
select an application of any application

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.780 
select an application of any application
on<00:01:00.300> your<00:01:00.329> phone<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:01.070> then<00:01:02.510> when<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:04.760> when<00:01:05.760> the

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
on your phone and then when the when the

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.340 
on your phone and then when the when the
phone<00:01:06.030> is<00:01:06.060> lock<00:01:06.330> all<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.600> have<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.780> do<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.020> make

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
phone is lock all you have to do is make

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.130 
phone is lock all you have to do is make
that<00:01:07.500> gesture<00:01:08.720> basically<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.780> can<00:01:09.930> launch

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
that gesture basically you can launch

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.010 
that gesture basically you can launch
apps<00:01:10.580> so<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:11.880> like<00:01:12.000> selfie<00:01:12.630> ass<00:01:12.750> camera

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
start dying right away so now if I fight

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.630 
start dying right away so now if I fight
exit<00:01:31.810> out<00:01:31.960> of<00:01:31.990> the<00:01:32.140> app<00:01:32.320> right<00:01:32.500> now<00:01:32.560> I'm<00:01:33.130> not

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
exit out of the app right now I'm not

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.600 
exit out of the app right now I'm not
able<00:01:33.820> to<00:01:33.970> do<00:01:34.180> those<00:01:34.330> same<00:01:34.600> gestures<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:36.220> it

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
able to do those same gestures so it

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.850 
able to do those same gestures so it
requires<00:01:37.030> that<00:01:37.360> you<00:01:37.420> have<00:01:37.690> a<00:01:37.900> pebble<00:01:38.259> and<00:01:38.440> the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
requires that you have a pebble and the

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.249 
requires that you have a pebble and the
smart<00:01:39.130> on<00:01:39.280> the<00:01:39.549> smartphone<00:01:39.909> using<00:01:40.810> the<00:01:41.049> same

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
smart on the smartphone using the same

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:43.700 
smart on the smartphone using the same
accelerometer<00:01:42.190> so<00:01:42.820> we<00:01:42.970> actually<00:01:43.119> match

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
accelerometer so we actually match

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.109 
accelerometer so we actually match
accelerometer<00:01:44.710> data<00:01:44.860> from<00:01:45.159> the<00:01:45.280> pebble<00:01:45.640> with

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
accelerometer data from the pebble with

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:47.730 
accelerometer data from the pebble with
the<00:01:46.270> android<00:01:46.600> phone<00:01:46.780> so<00:01:47.259> if<00:01:47.409> they<00:01:47.560> have<00:01:47.710> a

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
the android phone so if they have a

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.980 
the android phone so if they have a
match<00:01:48.009> you<00:01:48.280> know<00:01:48.369> but<00:01:48.550> both<00:01:48.729> going<00:01:49.060> into<00:01:49.330> the<00:01:49.479> Z

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
match you know but both going into the Z

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.170 
match you know but both going into the Z
direction<00:01:50.500> then<00:01:51.040> it<00:01:51.159> matches<00:01:51.549> an<00:01:51.670> unlock<00:01:52.000> the

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
direction then it matches an unlock the

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.690 
direction then it matches an unlock the
phone<00:01:52.360> so<00:01:53.320> Victor<00:01:53.710> made<00:01:53.860> an<00:01:53.950> awesome<00:01:54.100> website

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
phone so Victor made an awesome website

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.490 
phone so Victor made an awesome website
to<00:01:54.909> show<00:01:54.940> you<00:01:55.210> a<00:01:55.330> demo<00:01:55.630> of<00:01:55.750> how<00:01:55.990> it<00:01:56.350> would<00:01:56.470> work

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
to show you a demo of how it would work

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.630 
to show you a demo of how it would work
virtually<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:59.409> you<00:01:59.500> grab<00:01:59.710> the<00:01:59.920> Hubble<00:02:00.220> you

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
virtually so you grab the Hubble you

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.719 
virtually so you grab the Hubble you
start<00:02:00.880> shaking<00:02:01.240> it<00:02:01.380> well<00:02:02.380> yeah<00:02:02.710> but<00:02:03.039> if<00:02:03.640> you

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
start shaking it well yeah but if you

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.340 
start shaking it well yeah but if you
don't<00:02:03.940> have<00:02:04.090> a<00:02:04.119> leap<00:02:04.360> motion<00:02:04.750> at<00:02:04.840> home<00:02:05.080> you<00:02:05.289> can

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
don't have a leap motion at home you can

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.100 
don't have a leap motion at home you can
