00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:10.550 
you have the headphone jack and all the
other<00:02:09.030> holes<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.390> you'd<00:02:09.509> expect<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.929> find<00:02:10.229> on

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
other holes that you'd expect to find on

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.559 
other holes that you'd expect to find on
it<00:02:10.709> so<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.860> speaker<00:02:11.190> grills<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:12.209> charger

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
it so the speaker grills and the charger

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.470 
it so the speaker grills and the charger
and<00:02:12.720> so<00:02:12.870> forth<00:02:13.110> and<00:02:13.640> my<00:02:14.640> main<00:02:14.819> gripe<00:02:15.000> with<00:02:15.269> this

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
and so forth and my main gripe with this

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.780 
and so forth and my main gripe with this
in<00:02:15.720> terms<00:02:15.959> of<00:02:16.170> its<00:02:16.379> fit<00:02:16.769> is<00:02:17.010> as<00:02:17.190> you<00:02:17.340> can<00:02:17.400> see

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
in terms of its fit is as you can see

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.780 
in terms of its fit is as you can see
here<00:02:18.470> it<00:02:19.470> doesn't<00:02:19.650> actually<00:02:19.830> shut<00:02:20.580> properly

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
here it doesn't actually shut properly

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.300 
here it doesn't actually shut properly
when<00:02:21.180> you<00:02:21.270> close<00:02:21.510> it<00:02:21.540> so<00:02:22.380> if<00:02:22.500> we<00:02:22.620> go<00:02:22.800> ahead<00:02:22.950> and

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
when you close it so if we go ahead and

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.760 
when you close it so if we go ahead and
insert

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
insert

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:30.360 
insert
the<00:02:24.280> iPad<00:02:24.640> into<00:02:24.850> it<00:02:28.650> which<00:02:29.650> is<00:02:29.800> not<00:02:29.950> hard<00:02:30.100> to<00:02:30.160> do

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
the iPad into it which is not hard to do

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.910 
the iPad into it which is not hard to do
at<00:02:30.460> all<00:02:30.610> that's<00:02:30.970> it's<00:02:31.360> in<00:02:31.510> there<00:02:31.690> we<00:02:32.650> go<00:02:32.770> ahead

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
at all that's it's in there we go ahead

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.320 
at all that's it's in there we go ahead
and<00:02:33.070> set<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.310> iPad<00:02:33.610> into<00:02:33.760> it<00:02:33.970> you<00:02:34.060> can<00:02:34.210> see

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
and set the iPad into it you can see

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.420 
and set the iPad into it you can see
there's<00:02:34.510> a<00:02:34.690> pretty<00:02:34.960> big<00:02:35.110> gap<00:02:35.350> there<00:02:35.590> and<00:02:36.220> I<00:02:36.280> put

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
there's a pretty big gap there and I put

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.720 
there's a pretty big gap there and I put
this<00:02:36.520> in<00:02:36.670> my<00:02:36.760> bag<00:02:36.970> and<00:02:38.370> as<00:02:39.370> you<00:02:39.550> can<00:02:39.700> imagine

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
this in my bag and as you can imagine

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.690 
this in my bag and as you can imagine
there's<00:02:40.420> quite<00:02:40.690> a<00:02:41.680> lot<00:02:42.070> of<00:02:42.220> other<00:02:42.370> net<00:02:42.460> the

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
there's quite a lot of other net the

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.770 
there's quite a lot of other net the
camera<00:02:42.940> will<00:02:43.030> be<00:02:43.090> able<00:02:43.210> to<00:02:43.300> pick<00:02:43.390> it<00:02:43.450> up<00:02:43.630> but

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
camera will be able to pick it up but

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.230 
camera will be able to pick it up but
there's<00:02:43.960> quite<00:02:44.260> a<00:02:44.290> lot<00:02:44.500> of<00:02:44.650> little<00:02:44.890> pieces<00:02:45.240> of

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
there's quite a lot of little pieces of

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.010 
there's quite a lot of little pieces of
a<00:02:46.420> dust<00:02:47.170> all<00:02:47.470> over<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:47.830> screen<00:02:47.980> for<00:02:48.220> this<00:02:48.400> and

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
a dust all over the screen for this and

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.650 
a dust all over the screen for this and
that's<00:02:50.020> simply<00:02:50.500> because<00:02:50.680> when<00:02:51.040> you<00:02:51.100> close<00:02:51.310> it

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
that's simply because when you close it

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.020 
that's simply because when you close it
it's<00:02:52.660> a<00:02:52.840> pretty<00:02:53.080> poor<00:02:53.410> seal<00:02:54.220> that<00:02:54.460> you<00:02:54.580> get<00:02:54.790> in

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
it's a pretty poor seal that you get in

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.120 
it's a pretty poor seal that you get in
terms<00:02:55.570> of<00:02:55.690> protecting<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:56.590> actual<00:02:56.860> iPad

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
terms of protecting the actual iPad

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.270 
terms of protecting the actual iPad
itself<00:02:57.430> and<00:02:58.030> that's<00:02:58.150> probably<00:02:58.930> because<00:02:59.280> we're

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
itself and that's probably because we're

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.110 
itself and that's probably because we're
it<00:03:00.460> folds<00:03:00.790> in<00:03:00.910> right<00:03:01.120> here<00:03:01.420> I<00:03:02.970> mean<00:03:03.970> I'll<00:03:04.090> be

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
it folds in right here I mean I'll be

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.880 
it folds in right here I mean I'll be
worried<00:03:04.480> about<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:04.990> leather<00:03:05.170> cracking<00:03:05.650> here

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
worried about the leather cracking here

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.800 
worried about the leather cracking here
eventually<00:03:06.310> anyway<00:03:06.910> but<00:03:07.150> where<00:03:07.330> it<00:03:07.420> falls<00:03:07.600> in

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
eventually anyway but where it falls in

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.400 
eventually anyway but where it falls in
right<00:03:07.990> here<00:03:08.520> it's<00:03:09.520> not<00:03:09.700> made<00:03:10.410> particularly

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
right here it's not made particularly

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.810 
right here it's not made particularly
well<00:03:11.680> and<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:13.450> inside<00:03:13.900> of<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.140> case<00:03:14.380> is<00:03:14.800> as<00:03:15.760> a

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
well and the inside of the case is as a

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.450 
well and the inside of the case is as a
suede<00:03:16.300> feel<00:03:16.630> to<00:03:16.870> it<00:03:16.900> and<00:03:17.230> this<00:03:17.680> is<00:03:17.860> where<00:03:18.010> the

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 
suede feel to it and this is where the

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.920 
suede feel to it and this is where the
biggest<00:03:18.670> problem<00:03:19.000> I<00:03:19.090> have<00:03:19.210> with<00:03:19.240> this<00:03:19.480> is<00:03:19.720> when

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
biggest problem I have with this is when

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.890 
biggest problem I have with this is when
you<00:03:20.020> fold<00:03:20.260> this<00:03:20.470> back<00:03:20.530> and<00:03:21.010> you<00:03:21.700> hold<00:03:21.940> it<00:03:22.150> you

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
you fold this back and you hold it you

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.630 
you fold this back and you hold it you
have<00:03:23.230> to<00:03:23.470> push<00:03:23.650> your<00:03:23.800> thumb<00:03:23.860> into<00:03:24.160> the<00:03:24.280> screen

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
have to push your thumb into the screen

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.550 
have to push your thumb into the screen
pretty<00:03:25.030> hard<00:03:25.240> to<00:03:25.390> keep<00:03:25.660> to<00:03:25.840> get<00:03:25.990> a<00:03:26.020> good<00:03:26.260> grip

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
pretty hard to keep to get a good grip

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.830 
pretty hard to keep to get a good grip
if<00:03:27.280> you<00:03:27.430> don't<00:03:27.730> this<00:03:28.150> here<00:03:28.480> gives<00:03:28.750> you

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
if you don't this here gives you

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.750 
if you don't this here gives you
absolutely<00:03:29.530> no<00:03:29.709> grip<00:03:29.920> at<00:03:29.950> all<00:03:30.160> it's<00:03:30.459> pretty

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
absolutely no grip at all it's pretty

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.210 
absolutely no grip at all it's pretty
soft<00:03:31.060> its<00:03:31.300> weight<00:03:31.600> has<00:03:32.230> a<00:03:32.260> suede<00:03:32.620> finish<00:03:32.830> to<00:03:33.190> it

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
soft its weight has a suede finish to it

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.640 
soft its weight has a suede finish to it
and<00:03:33.790> if<00:03:33.940> you<00:03:34.030> hold<00:03:34.240> it<00:03:34.450> you<00:03:35.080> feel<00:03:35.320> it<00:03:35.350> slipping

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
and if you hold it you feel it slipping

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.020 
and if you hold it you feel it slipping
out<00:03:35.860> your<00:03:36.010> hand<00:03:36.160> so<00:03:36.340> you<00:03:36.370> either<00:03:36.520> need<00:03:36.760> to<00:03:36.820> use

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
out your hand so you either need to use

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.330 
out your hand so you either need to use
two<00:03:37.270> hands<00:03:37.570> or<00:03:39.060> you<00:03:40.060> need<00:03:40.209> to<00:03:40.360> do<00:03:40.510> this<00:03:40.690> and

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
two hands or you need to do this and

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.800 
two hands or you need to do this and
which<00:03:42.340> still<00:03:42.610> isn't<00:03:42.760> the<00:03:42.940> best<00:03:43.090> of<00:03:43.270> grips<00:03:43.540> I

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
which still isn't the best of grips I

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.449 
which still isn't the best of grips I
mean<00:03:44.260> I'd<00:03:44.350> rather<00:03:44.560> be<00:03:44.770> hold<00:03:44.980> on<00:03:45.100> the<00:03:45.190> iPad

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
mean I'd rather be hold on the iPad

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.550 
mean I'd rather be hold on the iPad
without<00:03:45.760> this<00:03:45.940> case<00:03:46.180> on<00:03:46.390> it<00:03:46.540> and<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:47.140> previous

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
without this case on it and the previous

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.949 
without this case on it and the previous
case<00:03:47.830> I<00:03:48.100> had<00:03:48.490> had<00:03:48.820> a<00:03:48.850> little<00:03:49.090> strap<00:03:49.750> across

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
case I had had a little strap across

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.780 
case I had had a little strap across
here<00:03:50.200> that<00:03:50.320> you<00:03:50.410> could<00:03:50.530> slide<00:03:51.160> your<00:03:51.400> hand<00:03:51.610> into

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
here that you could slide your hand into

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.210 
here that you could slide your hand into
and<00:03:52.470> not<00:03:53.470> need<00:03:53.620> to<00:03:53.740> necessarily<00:03:53.890> worry<00:03:56.220> yeah

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
and not need to necessarily worry yeah

so<00:05:52.460> the<00:05:52.550> magnetic<00:05:53.089> bond<00:05:53.839> here<00:05:54.229> is<00:05:55.099> nowhere

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
so the magnetic bond here is nowhere

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.760 
so the magnetic bond here is nowhere
near<00:05:55.729> as<00:05:55.849> good<00:05:55.940> as<00:05:56.210> it<00:05:56.810> was<00:05:57.050> on<00:05:57.080> the<00:05:57.440> previous

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
near as good as it was on the previous

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.860 
near as good as it was on the previous
gen<00:05:58.009> of<00:05:58.129> cases<00:05:58.669> but<00:05:58.879> again<00:05:59.330> the<00:05:59.449> problem<00:05:59.750> with

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
gen of cases but again the problem with

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.430 
gen of cases but again the problem with
does<00:06:00.050> is<00:06:00.229> they<00:06:00.379> only<00:06:00.589> cover<00:06:00.889> the<00:06:01.099> front<00:06:02.440> so

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 
does is they only cover the front so

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.179 
does is they only cover the front so
overall<00:06:04.870> em<00:06:05.870> because<00:06:06.409> this<00:06:06.710> doesn't<00:06:06.919> sit

00:06:07.179 --> 00:06:07.189 
overall em because this doesn't sit

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:09.279 
overall em because this doesn't sit
