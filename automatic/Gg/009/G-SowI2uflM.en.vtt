remember if there's stones in the jar
that's<00:02:15.230> what<00:02:15.620> makes<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:16.190> supersaturated

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
that's what makes the supersaturated

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.830 
that's what makes the supersaturated
solution<00:02:17.930> if<00:02:18.170> there's<00:02:18.920> not<00:02:19.250> stones<00:02:19.760> add<00:02:20.239> a<00:02:20.300> few
