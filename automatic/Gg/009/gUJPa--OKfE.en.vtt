00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.400
 hello to all and all these jets 4 g / t 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.040
 gold 880 we find ourselves today on 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.320
 call of duty black ops for a 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.090
 presentation of a new zombie mode 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.450
 available with the map pack 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.730
 revolution to know the inflection mode 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:29.090
 so I'll also do a video on 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.669
 the new malibu there was the way 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:35.390
 infections so actually at the beginning all the 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:37.640
 world begins one lives is actually the 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.560
 first who finds an antidote becomes 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.450
 human and the goal is to 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.490
 to kill the most to stay the most 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.100
 long possible humans so there I 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:49.790
 changed in March that I killed 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.720
 the person and you will see that it's 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.920
 not easy to stay human long 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.340
 because the zombies run very very 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.810
 quick 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.860
 Besides, it's a little bit abused 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:02.300
 bulk for sleepy scheibel what as 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.940
 it's hard to stay long 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.170
 humans especially whenever you 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:11.660
 do one that you are going to change 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.710
 of weapons to go online each 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.210
 Once you change weapons 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.530
 often they'll be two on you one 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.470
 moment you change your art you go 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.120
 to kill you then 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.990
 it's a bit frustrating but it's good 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.550
 like that you also have all the 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.520
 game menus while you are 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.890
 zombies or or human you are going to have 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.690
 bonuses so if 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.640
 zombies you will be able to have some 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:38.010
 ammunition in red that makes them 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:40.780
 ammunition in red that will allow you to 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.950
 to remove all the valves from the human 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.260
 he will have more balls 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.570
 you will have the double point January then 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.460
 that I think it's unfair of points 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.049
 decoin is 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.420
 and when you are human you have them 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:55.900
 Max ammo and the news can kill 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.400
 kill zombies and zombies that can 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.000
 take the duke so there the human had 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.890
 taken on October 12th all here it is a 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.840
 pretty cool fashion that do not last very long 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:09.640
 long time about 5 minutes is 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:11.319
 funny actually the goal is to stay 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.720
 the longest humans and in the end 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.819
 they do a total score calculation for 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.940
 to know who arrived who remained 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.630
 Longer 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.630
 there I change weapons 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:33.260
 the sam shimoda is quite nice to 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:38.989
 to do between friends in split screen sajoo 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:41.060
 aa2 and envisioned needed up to 4 then 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.340
 yeah often people get stuck at a 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.319
 in law 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:49.090
 This is a little technique is to 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.090
 camping makes it a place for 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.790
 ben to try to avoid now you 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.470
 see that every time we change 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.420
 weapons we tend to be tasted 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.510
 that time changes armed today 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.610
 is already on ourselves cftc and then so 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.230
 me if I find something to 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.489
 CIMADE improve is to diminish a 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.750
 little bit anyway the speed of 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:15.379
 zombies who for me did a little bit 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:18.230
 powerful one can not find the las 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:21.250
 unipol and in relation to what we can 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:24.200
 have in transit or a 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.620
 in the waters of the farmhouse lice in sur viva 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.420
 he daddy to the smic 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:33.890
 you see in 30 seconds in and the south 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:35.630
 do not miss the balconies do not miss 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.430
 bullets and 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.740
 in the beginning my heart you start to 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.740
 the executor when you are human and 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.650
 Then I think it's a rifle 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.370
 pump 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.019
 then I think it's 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.360
 an assault rifle know which one it is 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:55.720
 and after I think it's China 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.849
 club and ultimately falls to 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.540
 go back to the very first genk we have in 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:02.739
 the amap transit art in zambia and then 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.569
 I do not know why we are 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.040
 concerned I did it with a friend that does not 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:06.819
 go no further we did not succeed in 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.560
 change weapons 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.120
 far from this weekend and it's very 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.790
 difficult to kill enemies with this 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.730
 gain we did not understand why 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.579
 but it's maximum tax this gala so 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.049
 there you see the musicians I have them 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.310
 so taken there normally in Latvia 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.579
 had fewer balls in his 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.579
 charger 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:35.220
 pears rods to view here 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:39.750
 often the enemies that case of 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:41.370
 mam places here you also have 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.680
 the monkeys when you are human I 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.820
 did not speak that allows you to 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.990
 attract good times even effect 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.380
 add the door also a little what 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.380
 monkeys 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:58.360
 and so every time you are human 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:05:03.069
 you earn points and suddenly I 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:05.590
 makes you lose points to those who 

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:07.090
 those who are bi end of a certain time 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.129
 you lose points that you are not 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.729
 not human and the human guen obviously 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:11.729
 prey 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:23.360
 so there you see that the points on 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:25.280
 the screen on the right it goes up 1760 1710 it 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.740
 go up that goes up the more you actually stay 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.060
 I include you to have mounted the same 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.750
 there I was changing weapons 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.750
 I'm doing it mutated 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:40.840
 so the technique to actually avoid 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.529
 the bullets of humans it's these 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.659
 two 

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:45.129
 the market diagonally not if you have 

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:47.169
 noticed but most of those who 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:50.019
 are trying to market not right in 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:51.550
 diagonal simply because in 

00:05:50.019 --> 00:05:54.250
 walking 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.390
 by walking right we will make you 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:06:01.200
 glands by the bullets while in 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:04.090
 diagonal down he can avoid 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.850
 avoid yeah a lot of balls on the move 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:09.780
 diagonally when we live 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:12.100
 it's a technique yes 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.450
 wait for it is useless since the enemy 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.770
 is getting points so it's better 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:17.380
 walk diagonally to avoid 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:21.910
 maximum the balls and that's it no I'm 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:23.770
 I'm put yes there I'm not walking right all 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:26.890
 I had almost once on 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:28.600
 two I get to have it except when I get 

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:33.760
 miss a little bit here is the end of this 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:35.110
 part so I'm coming first it's in 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:38.740
 function of the number of points so I 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:40.750
 had 2630 here I hope this 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.160
 video about how infection will get you will 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.840
