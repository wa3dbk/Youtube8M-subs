 After all the future is quite popular Cancer angler is various while changing its surface material in the range 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:52.420
 Also I'd feel such as that created a movement 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:55.340
 Time that You're expressed material 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:01:00.320
 Last year 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.700
 Is the surface material of the pivot lung that appeared in September or October ? 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.670
 Using a 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.570
 So making it to the finish 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:11.930
 As pivot was 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:15.290
 When the movement out is quite surprisingly there is a sustained force I'd feel in early 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:18.560
 A word about him that makes an end turn 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.790
 Speaking of Angular one number called Angular itself 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.790

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.250
 Various without changing Nakata 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:49.170
 That 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.980
 At the time, I was using various materials while using Ronny 4-chome material, so there was such a system too 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.820
 But 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:57.040
 Even with 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:02:00.700

 It's a nice ball. 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:22.190
 In a little different and annoying as the oil passage Satiabura that would sell as a ball that card comes out 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:23.239
 I think it is a goal in the sense that the ball is strong and the ball around the end is tight . 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.750
 Hey hey 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.470

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.850
 What happened when I used it 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:14.110
 I see clearly because it is the first parliament, but when I use such a place, there is a feeling 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.860

 I think from a while ago, but for a little bit that oil that seems to be a bend 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:58.120
 If you use 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:58.780
 You seem to be tenaciously bent from that beginning to the end of the curve 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:04.829
