end up crying in this movie because it

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:16.610

feels<00:03:15.450> like<00:03:15.600> the<00:03:15.870> characters<00:03:16.290> are<00:03:16.440> real

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
feels like the characters are real

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.530 
feels like the characters are real
people<00:03:16.860> and<00:03:17.280> it's<00:03:17.400> a<00:03:17.459> love<00:03:17.670> story<00:03:17.820> and<00:03:18.390> an

people and it's a love story and an
adventure<00:03:18.989> story<00:03:19.050> so<00:03:19.920> it<00:03:20.910> was<00:03:21.120> difficult

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
adventure story so it was difficult

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.790 
adventure story so it was difficult
because<00:03:21.630> I'd<00:03:21.870> never<00:03:22.019> done<00:03:22.140> a<00:03:22.260> film<00:03:22.500> like<00:03:22.650> this

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
because I'd never done a film like this

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.920

before<00:03:23.220> but<00:03:23.610> I<00:03:23.880> never<00:03:24.060> was<00:03:24.480> at<00:03:24.630> a<00:03:24.660> loss<00:03:24.900> for

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
before but I never was at a loss for

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.840 
before but I never was at a loss for
finding<00:03:25.530> ways<00:03:25.680> to<00:03:25.890> write<00:03:26.040> music<00:03:26.190> for<00:03:26.550> the<00:03:26.610> film

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
finding ways to write music for the film
