00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:07.430
 Hello 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:12.080
 We will deliver a business petit course in front of Yoshino 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:17.060
 The first question I get from you guys is this one 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:21.900
 Thing that please tell me the secret of prompt decision closing 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:25.470
 It is a prompt decision that you have a business talk today and get an application today 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:32.129
 I always talked about this 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:35.670
 The goodness of the product and then the amount of money explanation and various talks and the customer's doubts and anxieties 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:42.260
 It's the last word to wipe off 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:49.880
 In the end I will talk about people who collapsed without buying and saying something 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:52.240
 For example, because I sold English language teaching materials for infants, I was talking this last 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.550
 The other day this kind of person came 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:59.570
 It was two years ago that was 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:02.940
 I really liked when I heard the story you two years ago 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:06.930
 I said you wanted to go by all means because it is a good one 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:11.080
 But please let me consider a little more 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:14.560
 I borrowed because I said so please 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:19.540
 So we have taught you about that, though 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:23.060
 Two days have passed since the business talk when the fire came on 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:29.210
 I got a phone call from the other day 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:33.200
 After saying how it was done, the customer is Mr. Yoshino after all I 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:37.480
 I think I'm going to do I say I'm going to buy 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:42.840
 So I was delighted to receive the application award 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:48.200
 And then the audience is do you say to something like this while writing your application form 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:52.369
 Mr. Yoshino I like to do something like that while I sign up for it 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:58.729
 Yeah was'm not Nante eh Son 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:59.960
 Visitor If I answer'm Is then the same product is not the same amount of money in such a Fu 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.710
 I told you 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:08.190
 Yes Yoshino-san At that time, the child was 0 years old 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:14.410
 Now my child is 2 years old and started playing at 0 years old and played at 2 years old 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:18.670
 It is the same product with the same contents of the same amount that I think is different from everyone 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:22.940
 I think the person who had been 0-year-old effect was also 3 times 2 times 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:27.350
 If it is now 2 years old, the effect is 1/3 minutes after 2 minutes 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:30.360
 I have done something really wasteful that I have been such a noble gas for two years 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:35.450
 It was like this . 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:42.790
 I think that the village by having actually missed the time is big 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:45.840
 So please be a good child decision I thought really be nice now 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.720
 I was talking about confusion 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:53.819
 Actually the decision of the customer 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:57.690
 I think that stretching This is quite often the time of mischief 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:03:04.140
 Start as soon as you think it is good 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:07.860
 It was good if people who did n't sound to push this back still went after 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:11.250
 It is very effective to talk about what you thought 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:17.420
 Please try it by all means 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.420
 It was the secret of sales petit course prompt decision closing of Yoshino mime
