00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.990
 yes hello and welcome to 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:23.400
 another little video of 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:28.800
 mobile-review DE this time in unboxing the 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.480
 samsung galaxy s3 i expect 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.180
 of course, no big changes 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.620
 in comparison to the normal model without 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.480
 I would like to have you anyway 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.579
 present this model gives you three 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.530
 colors namely in black in titanium 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.280
 grady variation is in front of you and in maar 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.350
 willingly not on the torture 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.120
 get the hang of gray cardboard with the 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.940
 technical details the model comes from 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.260
 by the way, of the telekom will, however 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.550
 also from vodafone in other provider 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.289
 offered quite simply because of 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.750
 fact that it is without reasonable lte 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:02.160
 contract, of course, hardly a difference 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.510
 the other model without lte makes im 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.299
 inner we find a little bit 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.299
 Surprisingly, the device itself here like 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.760
 said in titanium gray a carton as 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.409
 First I noticed the brief instructions on 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.930
 I'll put that aside 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:20.100
 then we find the carton still the battery 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.990
 here too 2100 milliamp hours 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.080
 in fact already the selection I need 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.450
 right at the first start of the device 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.540
 we still have something of course important 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.970
 charging data cable micro-usb also comes 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.439
 her to the side then of course that too 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.150
 Matching charger for the power outlet 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.820
 and as you say, last but not 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.780
 Least one in her headset 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.640
 amazingly, during the 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.549
 rest in black is available oh 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.549
 yes , there were almost forgotten pegs for the 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.380
 ears to adjust accordingly 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.840
 non-transparent and gray are natural 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:00.540
 even so, then we grab us 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:03.869
 the galaxy s3 137 mm long 71 millimeters 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.700
 wide 86 mm thin as well as the 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.890
 predecessor 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.789
 foil that means we remove the foils 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:13.129
 good times on the back 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.019
 keyword you draw that is 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:17.120
 actually the Lte variant in titanium 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.870
 gray is also available in black and white 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.510
 we have those led 8 megapixel camera 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.950
 full hd videos speaker 35 mm 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.750
 jackpot here again a note 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:32.209
 worldcom 4g left quietly here on the left 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.879
 button on and off switch and micro-usb 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.549
 Access above is the opening for the 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:39.349
 very thin battery cover then comes here 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.970
 the same as the accor I have my sim 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:42.230
 card already purely overturned micro-sim 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.660
 here you can save cards 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.000
 install 16gb has the device factory 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.190
 internal memory up to 64 gigabytes 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.040
 are no problem 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.760
 by micro sd that is battery case rows 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.190
 The thin lid on it klippan typical 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.230
 samsung halt appears at first sight 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.920
 pretty plastic is moderate though 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.910
 well processed so we have the device 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.860
 assembled it look here again 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.599
 by the way, inside works 1,4 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.010
 gigahertz fast quad-core processor 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:13.519
 although the same of the samsung galaxy 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.230
 s3 does his service but we have 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.910
 here the decisive advantage that we 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.590
 twice as much memory to 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.180
 to have disposal hot two 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.590
 gigabyte ram and with that are several 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.569
 applications at the same time no 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.230
 problem for the device was also before 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.540
 not the case 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.400
 but good if you have two gigabyte ram 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.560
 the application behave a bit 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.260
 more fluid if you 're multitasking seven 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.579
 b-note want to start the device sometimes 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.859
 just a switch here 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:39.530
 Press on the right side can 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:42.500
 we also see gti 93 05 here 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:45.200
 actually the last variant with the 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.389
 Samsung Galaxy S3 German Telecom 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.010
 the corresponding animation and us 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:51.349
 are equal in the main menu 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.569
 Now follows the installation wizard 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:55.970
 we are in Germany on why 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.950
 German wlan I turn off here I 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.040
 try the whole thing over there up there 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.709
 you can already see 4g is here only in the 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.060
 city ​​center very low so 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.370
 I must probably go to the cathedral square 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.690
 pilgrims will not now my devices 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:08.960
 secure over google because I have one 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.490
 whole 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.650
 amount of application on the second emergency 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.820
 that would last forever serve location 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.120
 I like to accept 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:19.220
 please wait for dropbox i would like to 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.570
 moment not optional settings 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.480
 Also, do not really do it right on 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:26.260
 finish so then comes again the help 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.580
 assistant for the touchwiz interface 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:32.240
 are of course also things of sap 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.980

 Software update has to be set up 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.990
 that means she has to accept the 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:48.020
 general terms and conditions 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.820

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.680
 the touchwiz surface you already have 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.210
 from samsung galaxy s3 or from 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.470
 other devices here in the 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.380

 baseband ali 7 that we are in small 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.930
 jump forward and hope 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.430
 that the software now a few 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.960
 maybe bring more features or functions 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.040
 one or the other from the leaves can be 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.290
