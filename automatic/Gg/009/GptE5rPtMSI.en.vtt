one<00:03:06.680> thing<00:03:06.860> I<00:03:06.920> did<00:03:07.100> notice<00:03:07.250> is<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:07.730> paint<00:03:08.000> that

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
one thing I did notice is the paint that

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.949 
one thing I did notice is the paint that
they<00:03:08.720> show<00:03:08.930> on<00:03:08.959> the<00:03:09.260> box<00:03:09.470> of<00:03:09.739> course<00:03:09.950> he<00:03:10.670> has

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
they show on the box of course he has

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.199 
they show on the box of course he has
little<00:03:11.959> details<00:03:12.470> going<00:03:12.770> down<00:03:13.070> onto<00:03:13.850> his<00:03:13.940> tail

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
little details going down onto his tail

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:19.300 
little details going down onto his tail
but<00:03:14.510> not<00:03:15.020> on<00:03:15.200> here

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.940 

and<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:20.660> one<00:03:20.840> I<00:03:21.140> was<00:03:21.290> the<00:03:21.410> most<00:03:21.590> worried<00:03:21.920> about

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
and the one I was the most worried about

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.260 
and the one I was the most worried about
but<00:03:22.280> I<00:03:22.310> wanted<00:03:22.580> the<00:03:22.670> most<00:03:22.880> was<00:03:23.090> the

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
but I wanted the most was the

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:29.230 
but I wanted the most was the
Dilophosaurus<00:03:25.810> whoops<00:03:26.810> he<00:03:27.940> didn't<00:03:28.940> seem<00:03:29.150> to

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.240 
Dilophosaurus whoops he didn't seem to

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.980 
Dilophosaurus whoops he didn't seem to
work<00:03:29.420> at<00:03:29.600> all<00:03:29.810> in<00:03:30.140> the<00:03:30.260> box<00:03:30.550> but<00:03:31.569> to<00:03:32.569> me<00:03:32.690> he's

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990 
work at all in the box but to me he's

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.720 
work at all in the box but to me he's
the<00:03:33.140> coolest<00:03:33.350> one<00:03:33.650> with<00:03:33.860> his<00:03:34.010> action<00:03:34.490> feature

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
the coolest one with his action feature

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.330 
the coolest one with his action feature
he<00:03:35.060> moves<00:03:35.300> his<00:03:35.540> he<00:03:36.500> does<00:03:36.620> not<00:03:36.800> move<00:03:37.010> his<00:03:37.130> tail

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
he moves his he does not move his tail

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.150 
he moves his he does not move his tail
but<00:03:37.819> his<00:03:37.910> tail<00:03:38.090> is<00:03:38.270> articulated<00:03:39.020> one<00:03:39.950> thing

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
but his tail is articulated one thing

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.270 
but his tail is articulated one thing
also<00:03:40.340> the<00:03:40.640> t-rex<00:03:41.120> arms<00:03:41.510> are<00:03:42.160> articulated<00:03:43.160> on

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
also the t-rex arms are articulated on

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.940 
also the t-rex arms are articulated on
here<00:03:43.630> he<00:03:44.630> only<00:03:44.810> has<00:03:44.900> two<00:03:45.170> screws<00:03:45.410> showing<00:03:45.830> on

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
here he only has two screws showing on

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:53.170 
here he only has two screws showing on
the<00:03:46.040> bottom<00:03:46.310> there<00:03:47.680> so<00:03:49.630> basically<00:03:50.630> he<00:03:52.180> his

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
the bottom there so basically he his

00:03:53.180 --> 00:04:00.309 
the bottom there so basically he his
frills<00:03:53.600> move<00:03:53.900> forward<00:03:54.380> and<00:03:55.480> he<00:03:56.480> bites

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.080 

I<00:04:00.379> can<00:04:00.709> shayateen<00:04:01.310> there

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.300 

there's<00:04:04.450> a<00:04:04.510> little<00:04:04.630> JW<00:04:05.230> logo<00:04:05.530> on<00:04:05.650> his<00:04:05.740> frill<00:04:06.100> I

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
there's a little JW logo on his frill I

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.190 
there's a little JW logo on his frill I
like<00:04:06.970> that<00:04:07.150> this<00:04:07.270> matches<00:04:07.510> the<00:04:07.810> paint<00:04:07.990> scheme

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
like that this matches the paint scheme

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:15.210 
like that this matches the paint scheme
of<00:04:08.680> the<00:04:10.680> growler<00:04:11.880> version<00:04:13.440> if<00:04:14.440> they<00:04:14.560> have<00:04:14.740> like

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
of the growler version if they have like

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.640 
of the growler version if they have like
the<00:04:15.340> $15<00:04:15.940> ones<00:04:16.209> these<00:04:16.900> I<00:04:16.959> picked<00:04:17.200> up<00:04:17.350> at<00:04:17.500> Target

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
the $15 ones these I picked up at Target

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:25.320 
the $15 ones these I picked up at Target
these<00:04:20.650> arms<00:04:20.950> are<00:04:21.090> articulated<00:04:23.160> also<00:04:24.160> now<00:04:25.120> this

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
these arms are articulated also now this

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.700 
these arms are articulated also now this
one<00:04:25.540> does<00:04:26.110> not<00:04:26.290> seem<00:04:26.650> to<00:04:26.680> be<00:04:26.800> articulate<00:04:27.400> now

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
one does not seem to be articulate now

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.460 
one does not seem to be articulate now
or<00:04:29.710> it's<00:04:29.889> stuck<00:04:30.699> can't<00:04:31.240> tell<00:04:31.479> might<00:04:32.139> be<00:04:32.289> that

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
or it's stuck can't tell might be that

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.279 
or it's stuck can't tell might be that
way<00:04:32.590> because<00:04:32.889> the<00:04:33.210> thrill<00:04:34.210> rests<00:04:34.870> right<00:04:35.020> there

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:35.289 
way because the thrill rests right there

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:40.379 
way because the thrill rests right there
so

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:45.119 

yeah<00:04:40.990> and<00:04:41.349> they<00:04:42.039> they<00:04:42.490> were<00:04:42.669> 699<00:04:43.919> kappa<00:04:44.919> higher

00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:45.129 
yeah and they they were 699 kappa higher

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:46.770 
yeah and they they were 699 kappa higher
price<00:04:45.460> but<00:04:45.729> when<00:04:45.909> you<00:04:45.969> think<00:04:46.180> is<00:04:46.300> like<00:04:46.479> kind<00:04:46.750> of

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
price but when you think is like kind of

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.839 
price but when you think is like kind of
funny<00:04:47.080> little<00:04:47.259> character<00:04:47.860> thing<00:04:48.069> that<00:04:48.340> has<00:04:48.819> a

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:48.849 
funny little character thing that has a

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:50.339 
funny little character thing that has a
little<00:04:49.090> action<00:04:49.360> feature<00:04:49.599> i<00:04:49.900> think<00:04:50.139> it's<00:04:50.229> a

00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:50.349 
little action feature i think it's a

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:55.650 
little action feature i think it's a
good<00:04:50.469> price<00:04:50.770> and<00:04:51.580> these<00:04:51.789> look<00:04:51.969> better<00:04:52.210> than

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.200 

some<00:04:56.230> of<00:04:56.320> the<00:04:56.380> stuff<00:04:56.620> that<00:04:56.650> they're<00:04:57.210> putting

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
some of the stuff that they're putting

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.520 
some of the stuff that they're putting
out<00:04:58.420> I'm<00:04:59.170> kind<00:04:59.350> of<00:04:59.470> getting<00:04:59.620> used<00:04:59.740> to<00:05:00.010> it<00:05:00.220> but

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
out I'm kind of getting used to it but

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.440 
out I'm kind of getting used to it but
one<00:05:02.530> thing<00:05:02.560> I<00:05:02.830> was<00:05:02.950> kind<00:05:03.160> of<00:05:03.310> bummed<00:05:04.090> out<00:05:04.300> about

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
one thing I was kind of bummed out about

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.960 
one thing I was kind of bummed out about
is<00:05:04.870> I<00:05:05.110> guess<00:05:06.010> you<00:05:06.130> could<00:05:06.280> just<00:05:06.310> set<00:05:06.700> it<00:05:06.850> in

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
is I guess you could just set it in

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:07.260 
is I guess you could just set it in
there

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
there

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.470 
there
it's<00:05:07.540> hoping<00:05:07.840> to<00:05:07.930> be<00:05:08.020> able<00:05:08.080> to<00:05:08.230> repackage<00:05:08.800> the

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:09.480 
it's hoping to be able to repackage the

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.790 
it's hoping to be able to repackage the
pretty<00:05:10.480> much<00:05:10.630> there's<00:05:10.870> a<00:05:10.960> knot<00:05:11.200> tied<00:05:11.650> around

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
pretty much there's a knot tied around

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.370 
pretty much there's a knot tied around
each<00:05:12.190> of<00:05:12.370> their<00:05:12.490> ankles<00:05:13.000> so<00:05:13.330> you<00:05:13.780> had<00:05:13.960> to<00:05:14.080> undo

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
each of their ankles so you had to undo

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.400 
each of their ankles so you had to undo
it<00:05:14.560> and<00:05:14.590> pull<00:05:15.250> it<00:05:15.400> through<00:05:15.660> the<00:05:16.660> packaging<00:05:17.260> I

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
it and pull it through the packaging I

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.470 
it and pull it through the packaging I
really<00:05:17.830> like<00:05:18.010> that<00:05:18.250> how<00:05:18.910> they<00:05:19.060> added<00:05:19.390> the

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.480 
really like that how they added the

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.110 
really like that how they added the
little<00:05:19.980> bars<00:05:20.980> across<00:05:21.310> there<00:05:21.670> kind<00:05:21.940> of<00:05:22.000> like

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
little bars across there kind of like

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.440 
little bars across there kind of like
it's<00:05:22.300> in<00:05:22.450> its<00:05:22.630> own<00:05:23.550> paddock

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.400 

so<00:05:27.960> I<00:05:28.320> might<00:05:28.860> kind<00:05:29.550> of<00:05:29.700> display<00:05:30.120> min<00:05:30.390> that

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
so I might kind of display min that
