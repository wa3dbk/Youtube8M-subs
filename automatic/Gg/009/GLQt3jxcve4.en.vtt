while I did enjoy this book
I<00:01:55.780> had<00:01:56.350> quite<00:01:56.500> a<00:01:56.560> few<00:01:56.619> problems<00:01:56.890> were<00:01:57.159> there

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
I had quite a few problems were there

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.480 
I had quite a few problems were there
the<00:01:57.759> pace<00:01:58.000> was<00:01:58.450> very<00:01:58.899> slow<00:01:59.259> I<00:01:59.680> wasn't<00:02:00.399> very

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
the pace was very slow I wasn't very

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.999 
the pace was very slow I wasn't very
satisfied<00:02:01.119> with<00:02:01.420> the<00:02:01.899> conclusion<00:02:02.469> it<00:02:02.649> left<00:02:02.860> my

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
satisfied with the conclusion it left my

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.350 
satisfied with the conclusion it left my
quite<00:02:03.250> a<00:02:03.280> few<00:02:03.549> open<00:02:03.939> ends<00:02:04.740> which<00:02:06.180> obviously<00:02:07.180> it

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
quite a few open ends which obviously it

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.999 
quite a few open ends which obviously it
was<00:02:07.479> intentional<00:02:08.080> I<00:02:08.380> don't<00:02:08.590> really<00:02:08.739> like<00:02:08.979> that

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
was intentional I don't really like that

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.040 
was intentional I don't really like that
with<00:02:09.459> books<00:02:09.819> I<00:02:10.119> really<00:02:10.450> like<00:02:10.660> how<00:02:10.869> it<00:02:11.019> makes

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
with books I really like how it makes

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.530 
with books I really like how it makes

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
writing so to me it didn't seem like his

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.400 
writing so to me it didn't seem like his
character<00:02:57.940> just<00:02:58.360> won't<00:02:58.569> flesh<00:02:58.780> out<00:02:58.989> it<00:02:59.230> seemed

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
very intentionally sort of ethereal and

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.690 
very intentionally sort of ethereal and
it<00:03:01.959> puts<00:03:02.170> a<00:03:02.260> lot<00:03:02.440> of<00:03:02.470> focus<00:03:02.680> on<00:03:03.130> the<00:03:03.519> main
