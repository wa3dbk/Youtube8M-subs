00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
and this is the last one great see as

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.120 
and this is the last one great see as
you<00:04:20.850> can<00:04:21.000> see<00:04:21.359> you<00:04:22.049> can<00:04:22.260> keep<00:04:22.470> your<00:04:22.680> abs<00:04:22.889> strong

without having to do multiple sit-ups or
crunches<00:04:25.710> and<00:04:26.280> for<00:04:26.880> many<00:04:27.090> of<00:04:27.330> us<00:04:27.419> it's

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
crunches and for many of us it's

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.110 
crunches and for many of us it's
probably<00:04:28.169> safer<00:04:28.560> this<00:04:28.710> way<00:04:28.790> you<00:04:29.790> won't<00:04:30.000> be

probably safer this way you won't be
wasting<00:04:30.330> any<00:04:30.720> time<00:04:30.840> and<00:04:31.410> guess<00:04:31.590> what<00:04:31.880> you<00:04:32.880> can

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
wasting any time and guess what you can

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.150 
wasting any time and guess what you can
do<00:04:33.240> these<00:04:33.419> ab<00:04:33.690> exercises<00:04:34.320> every<00:04:34.770> day<00:04:34.950> these

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
do these ab exercises every day these

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.879 
do these ab exercises every day these

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:40.880 
are not muscles that need 48 hours to
rest<00:04:38.160> so<00:04:38.550> there
