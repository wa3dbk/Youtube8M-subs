00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.500 
the inside and it looks like it's really
well<00:02:30.720> built<00:02:30.990> the<00:02:31.740> best<00:02:31.950> part<00:02:32.310> of<00:02:32.430> this<00:02:32.610> is<00:02:32.850> that

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
well built the best part of this is that

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.970 
well built the best part of this is that
this<00:02:33.660> carburetor<00:02:34.080> was<00:02:34.470> only<00:02:36.440> $23<00:02:37.440> and<00:02:37.740> that

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
this carburetor was only $23 and that

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.110 
this carburetor was only $23 and that
included<00:02:38.520> shipping<00:02:39.240> and<00:02:39.590> it<00:02:40.590> shipped

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
included shipping and it shipped

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.810 
included shipping and it shipped
priority<00:02:42.120> I<00:02:42.150> believe<00:02:43.130> so<00:02:44.130> it<00:02:44.310> was<00:02:44.460> here<00:02:44.700> in

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
priority I believe so it was here in

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.780 
priority I believe so it was here in
three<00:02:45.120> days<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:45.690> it<00:02:46.620> ships<00:02:47.070> from<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.430> US

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
three days and it ships from the US

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.380 
three days and it ships from the US
somewhere<00:02:48.330> so<00:02:48.920> for<00:02:49.920> 23<00:02:50.520> bucks<00:02:50.790> that<00:02:51.090> you<00:02:51.240> know

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
somewhere so for 23 bucks that you know

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.380 
somewhere so for 23 bucks that you know
for<00:02:52.730> you<00:02:53.730> know<00:02:53.820> if<00:02:53.910> you're<00:02:54.030> working<00:02:54.240> on

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
for you know if you're working on

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.390 
for you know if you're working on
someone's<00:02:54.840> snowblower<00:02:55.410> this<00:02:55.860> is<00:02:56.010> probably

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
someone's snowblower this is probably

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.260 
someone's snowblower this is probably
cheaper<00:02:56.730> than<00:02:59.240> cleaning<00:03:00.240> their<00:03:00.390> carburetor

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
cheaper than cleaning their carburetor

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.180 
cheaper than cleaning their carburetor
last<00:03:03.270> year<00:03:03.750> I<00:03:03.960> found<00:03:04.440> this<00:03:04.680> box

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
last year I found this box

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.700 
last year I found this box
I<00:03:05.280> got<00:03:05.430> an<00:03:05.550> Oregon<00:03:06.150> one<00:03:06.390> and<00:03:06.720> I<00:03:07.140> think<00:03:07.410> this<00:03:07.560> was

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
I got an Oregon one and I think this was

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
I got an Oregon one and I think this was
for<00:03:07.920> like<00:03:08.070> a<00:03:08.100> 10<00:03:08.400> horsepower<00:03:08.990> snow<00:03:09.990> blower<00:03:10.320> and

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
for like a 10 horsepower snow blower and

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.150 
for like a 10 horsepower snow blower and
it<00:03:11.730> was<00:03:12.390> a<00:03:12.420> two<00:03:12.660> cups<00:03:12.900> of<00:03:13.080> snow<00:03:13.320> king<00:03:13.620> engine<00:03:14.040> as

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
it was a two cups of snow king engine as

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.660 
it was a two cups of snow king engine as
well

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
well

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.690 
well
the<00:03:15.240> Oregon<00:03:15.780> one<00:03:15.990> worked<00:03:16.560> fine<00:03:17.340> on<00:03:17.370> the

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
the Oregon one worked fine on the

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.310 
the Oregon one worked fine on the
snowblower<00:03:18.060> I<00:03:18.240> think<00:03:18.600> this<00:03:18.720> one<00:03:18.900> had<00:03:19.110> an

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
snowblower I think this one had an

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.600 
snowblower I think this one had an
adjustable<00:03:20.100> bull<00:03:20.940> nut<00:03:21.209> on<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.660> bottom<00:03:22.080> and<00:03:22.610> it

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
adjustable bull nut on the bottom and it

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.640 
adjustable bull nut on the bottom and it
did<00:03:23.820> cost<00:03:24.120> a<00:03:24.540> little<00:03:24.720> more<00:03:24.990> money<00:03:25.050> it<00:03:25.530> might

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
did cost a little more money it might

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.500 
did cost a little more money it might
have<00:03:25.800> been<00:03:25.890> about<00:03:26.100> thirty<00:03:26.430> five<00:03:26.700> dollars<00:03:27.300> or

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
have been about thirty five dollars or

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.949 
have been about thirty five dollars or
so<00:03:27.750> but<00:03:28.620> it<00:03:28.770> did<00:03:28.920> work<00:03:29.130> fine<00:03:29.550> but<00:03:30.450> it<00:03:30.660> didn't

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
so but it did work fine but it didn't

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.320 
so but it did work fine but it didn't
seem<00:03:31.290> to<00:03:31.650> be<00:03:31.770> built<00:03:32.100> quite<00:03:32.610> as<00:03:32.790> well<00:03:33.000> as<00:03:33.150> this

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
seem to be built quite as well as this

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.990 
seem to be built quite as well as this
one<00:03:33.600> so<00:03:34.290> what<00:03:34.440> I'm<00:03:34.560> gonna<00:03:34.680> have<00:03:34.800> to<00:03:34.950> do<00:03:35.250> is<00:03:35.459> get

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
one so what I'm gonna have to do is get

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.300 
one so what I'm gonna have to do is get
this<00:03:36.180> thing<00:03:36.420> on<00:03:36.540> the<00:03:36.600> snowblower<00:03:37.140> and<00:03:37.620> see<00:03:37.950> if

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
this thing on the snowblower and see if

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.910 
this thing on the snowblower and see if
it<00:03:38.610> works<00:03:38.880> I<00:03:39.270> don't<00:03:39.690> like<00:03:40.110> the<00:03:40.320> fact<00:03:40.590> that<00:03:40.739> it

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
it works I don't like the fact that it

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.620 
it works I don't like the fact that it
doesn't<00:03:41.190> have<00:03:41.310> an<00:03:41.430> adjustable<00:03:41.970> knot<00:03:42.330> on<00:03:42.480> the

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
doesn't have an adjustable knot on the

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.330 
doesn't have an adjustable knot on the
bottom<00:03:43.020> but<00:03:43.739> I<00:03:44.900> don't<00:03:45.900> know<00:03:46.020> I<00:03:46.260> guess<00:03:46.739> since

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
bottom but I don't know I guess since

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.800 
bottom but I don't know I guess since
its<00:03:47.520> brand<00:03:47.790> new<00:03:48.000> I<00:03:48.030> should<00:03:48.180> need<00:03:48.570> to<00:03:48.600> adjust

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
its brand new I should need to adjust

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.500 
its brand new I should need to adjust
anything<00:03:49.620> in<00:03:50.010> fact<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:50.580> new<00:03:50.760> snowblowers<00:03:51.390> you

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
anything in fact the new snowblowers you

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.370 
anything in fact the new snowblowers you
buy<00:03:51.690> today<00:03:52.350> aren't<00:03:52.709> adjustable<00:03:53.550> at<00:03:53.670> all<00:03:54.380> so

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
buy today aren't adjustable at all so

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.590 
buy today aren't adjustable at all so
anyhow<00:03:56.100> I<00:03:56.370> just<00:03:56.700> thought<00:03:56.820> you<00:03:56.970> guys<00:03:57.090> might<00:03:57.150> be
