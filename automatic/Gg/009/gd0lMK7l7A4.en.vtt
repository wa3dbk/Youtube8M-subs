00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:06.180
 and that's the turn today we end up 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.950
 for a little video so in which 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.130
 I will introduce the application 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.330
 with which I record my videos 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.580
 so this is a video anyway a little 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.930
 unusual because it's between 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.920
 app discovery and tutorial 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.560
 so do not know where the place is in 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.300
 done so I showed you quickly 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.420
 because I do not want to drag everything 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.250
 be clear precise and fast so I 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.650
 showed the application so the 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:37.079
 available on the ps store she 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:41.960
 is called rick order pro so a 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:44.160
 accessit their route as shown by then 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.629
 so she is available in two 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.430
 versions of our free version is 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.750
 a monopoly game clean version so the 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.969
 rations free is free as the guide 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.350
 indicates but only allows 30 seconds 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.960
 while the version 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.570
 pro so the one who is here so the 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:05.220
 paying so would indicate the price on 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:07.110
 the video I could in the head and so that's it 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.430
 named allows you to register as many 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:14.369
 time you want me I use the 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:16.409
 pro version so this Nice plextor and 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.860
 it's the only application that allows 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.600
 to save so except big mistake of 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.939
 my part 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.430
 your screen on 100 of its galaxy tab 1 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.350
 2 or 3 so that's why it's very 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.689
 interesting and I'm its meaning that we 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.439
 Acceptable I have struggled to find 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.240
 the application to film my 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.920
 screen and when I found them down 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.100
 it was a great happiness these 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.360
 applications the street so I do not know 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.310
 I love pinball because I do 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.350
 turn my camera on the table 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.710
 so is the test 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.909
 So here is so we therefore there 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.310
 the application you downloaded 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.320
 that here I did not choose doodle jump 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.329
 a little game that does not ask too much 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.310
 resources finally good it's still a 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.750
 game so we ask for something to 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.030
 able to film show you a little bit 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.670
 the rendering so we will launch the application 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.320
 when you download it we went 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.209
 proven please so that's it 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.030
 very ergonomic menu so as I 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.950
 was saying his birth 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.940
 their route so if you do not know what 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.330
 I invite you to search on 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.750
 Internet 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.310
 it's very easy to find and then to 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.569
 software like top of a month the one that 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.930
 I used for the road and others 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.720
 appliances 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.430
 there are a lot of tutorials so you 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.500
 for sure we start so 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.620
 the application of a little by little English 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.150
 very closely these nomic gossip with 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:36.720
 so vosges three options or just 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:40.660
 so filmed if here we have the option option 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.070
 is here we left so I have everything from 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.209
 next do a test with doodle jump 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.620
 that you have to show a little bit the rendering 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.820
 so we will not leave we will do 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.690
 film before without predicting the evolution 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:58.060
 so at the option level 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:03:03.370
 it's very simple so we have 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:05.830
 the encoder the resolution founded the 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.519
 fps so the frame rate 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:12.069
 second actually we have the frequency so 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.590
 in hertz we make sure you are 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.970
 no we could we have two options as per 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.470
 example and all I put 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.290
 currently and it's not very useful 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.640
 because we can directly directly 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.970
 active and jl keys by master of 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:29.140
 your samsung so back on the menu 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:31.299
 of the application to film we go everything 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.209
 just click here we 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:38.100
 save and so we will launch by 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:41.079
 example the google doodle jump in france 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.590
 so it shows the vertical I have no 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:46.379
 luck 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.640
 so laundry here at the level of 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:50.879
 the video quality is correct 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:54.299
 there are some small tools not no 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:59.489
 more very fine obviously after the ccao 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:04:03.530
 nothing so we can see that it's fine 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:06.629
 to be not very fluid yellow is rather the 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:11.489
 not to be very proud of that 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:13.980
 remains correct and number so power 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.120
 to be the lidho it's very simple once 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.299
 so your video running 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.630
 just scroll down the screen and then 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:24.570
 click on the screen of a quarter 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:27.240
 of hour then washed and with 100g by the 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.010
 directory shown if you no longer have 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.830
 to leave if he did not say 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:36.139
 record a video we can see 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:40.560
 the video is saved in the menu 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:42.990
 so in the place indicated for me it's 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.120
 all for the pure for this video I have 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.380
 noted to tell you this application which 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.870
 is still very well done very well 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.479
 designed which more is the developers are 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.220
 assets it is updated enough 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:57.150
 Frequently 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:05:00.590
 so I advise you and I tell you 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.590
 see you soon for next time
