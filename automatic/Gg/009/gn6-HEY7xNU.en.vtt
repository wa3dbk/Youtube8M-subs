00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.900 
fusion so I'm going to do this at about
I'm<00:02:07.080> going<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.229> at<00:02:07.380> 18%<00:02:07.740> power

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.530 

click<00:02:11.910> okay

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.320 

in<00:02:16.599> print<00:02:17.379> and<00:02:17.650> it's<00:02:18.640> on<00:02:18.819> its<00:02:18.849> way<00:02:19.030> over<00:02:19.239> to

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
in print and it's on its way over to

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:26.370 
in print and it's on its way over to
laser<00:02:21.720> so<00:02:22.720> let's<00:02:22.900> bring<00:02:23.079> it<00:02:23.200> over<00:02:23.409> here

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.870 

we've<00:02:26.980> already<00:02:27.130> set<00:02:27.400> this<00:02:27.490> up<00:02:27.700> with<00:02:27.850> some

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
we've already set this up with some

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.090 
we've already set this up with some
spacers<00:02:28.480> and<00:02:28.690> what<00:02:29.350> that's<00:02:29.530> going<00:02:29.650> to<00:02:29.710> do<00:02:29.890> is

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
spacers and what that's going to do is

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.130 
spacers and what that's going to do is
allow<00:02:30.220> me<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:30.730> engrave<00:02:31.180> over<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.570> edges<00:02:31.930> of

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
allow me to engrave over the edges of

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.050 
allow me to engrave over the edges of
the<00:02:32.440> iPad<00:02:32.830> which<00:02:33.160> is<00:02:33.280> exactly<00:02:33.610> how<00:02:33.730> I<00:02:33.790> want<00:02:34.000> to

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
the iPad which is exactly how I want to

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:42.030 
the iPad which is exactly how I want to
set<00:02:34.240> it<00:02:34.360> up<00:02:35.340> come<00:02:36.340> over<00:02:36.460> here<00:02:37.000> to<00:02:37.210> my<00:02:37.330> job<00:02:41.040> the

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
set it up come over here to my job the

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.870 
set it up come over here to my job the
jobs<00:02:42.310> there<00:02:43.770> make<00:02:44.770> sure<00:02:44.950> it's<00:02:45.100> all<00:02:45.280> focused

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:56.140 

lets<00:02:48.880> focused<00:02:49.330> in<00:02:49.480> place

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.750 

and<00:02:56.690> they<00:02:56.870> go

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.280 

so<00:03:02.300> everyone's<00:03:02.629> always<00:03:02.780> a<00:03:02.870> little<00:03:03.050> nervous

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
so everyone's always a little nervous

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.570 
so everyone's always a little nervous
when<00:03:03.500> you're<00:03:03.709> engraving<00:03:04.159> something<00:03:04.430> like

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
when you're engraving something like

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.140 
when you're engraving something like
this<00:03:04.790> because<00:03:05.650> you<00:03:06.650> never<00:03:06.830> know<00:03:07.190> exactly

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
this because you never know exactly

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.809 
this because you never know exactly
where<00:03:08.390> it's<00:03:08.510> going<00:03:08.690> engrave<00:03:09.110> so<00:03:09.950> the<00:03:10.519> secret

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
where it's going engrave so the secret

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:12.670 
where it's going engrave so the secret
to<00:03:10.940> it<00:03:11.060> is<00:03:11.239> we<00:03:11.569> actually<00:03:11.810> use<00:03:12.110> our<00:03:12.319> red<00:03:12.470> dot

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
to it is we actually use our red dot

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.490 
to it is we actually use our red dot
pointer<00:03:13.099> to<00:03:13.700> lay<00:03:13.909> out<00:03:14.150> the<00:03:14.900> template<00:03:15.319> of<00:03:15.379> the

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
pointer to lay out the template of the

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.670 
pointer to lay out the template of the
iPad<00:03:15.860> so<00:03:16.610> we<00:03:16.700> can<00:03:16.849> see<00:03:17.060> the<00:03:17.900> exact<00:03:18.319> placement

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
iPad so we can see the exact placement

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:25.059 
iPad so we can see the exact placement
of<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:19.040> engraving<00:03:19.489> oh<00:03:23.230> yeah<00:03:24.260> starting<00:03:24.830> to<00:03:24.890> see

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
of the engraving oh yeah starting to see

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:26.890 
of the engraving oh yeah starting to see
it<00:03:25.160> here<00:03:25.310> now<00:03:25.489> getting<00:03:26.330> a<00:03:26.360> nice<00:03:26.540> white<00:03:26.870> and
