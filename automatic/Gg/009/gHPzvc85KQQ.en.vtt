00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.409
 also without official name 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.900
 the model should definitely be

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:23.959
 units for 300 thousand units per year 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.959

 it puts the mark in position 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.280
 strategy to meet the growing 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:42.490
 world demand for compact vehicles 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:46.120
 which is expected to grow by around 6.2 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:48.790
 million vehicles by 2017 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.290

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.270
 position of the model in the national market 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.590
 osvaldo still a concept car but already 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.540
 There is a lot that you are 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.670
 presenting the Brazilian public is a 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.470
 study you already know clearly the 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.880
 segment you are going to participate in 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.550
 this entry segment of cars 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.770
 Compact who your competitors the 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.150
 that they are buying today and that they 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.040
 would like to buy what's being 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.380
 offered for that we already have 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.300
 even being an April concept to 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.760
 couple of details this release 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.470
 I would say that the concept is only in the name 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.330
 in fact it is already practically 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.010
 Ready because that's what you said 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.750
 a reality study is all 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.210
 prepared how long you still 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.700
 calculate that it is definitely 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:33.100
 completed this project there is a series 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.050
 of not only refinement stages 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.660
 of this planning but also of 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.340
 manufacturing supplier engineering 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.680
 you have seen your cadence ford 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.780
 since the exportation we have presented the 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.850
 first concept of eco sport that 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.160
 took several months until the car in the 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.720
 how to make a novelty right 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.540
 people like to see a car almost 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.560
 the day after the shops and 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.870
 now we're actually working 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.780
 it is still a concept car ie had 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.670
 work for the front and the expectation is 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.010
 much success and of course for more 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.990
 a global product without doubt because 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.820
 to bring the pillars of the brand I think 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.980
 that the design of the car showed today that 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.780
 it's a champion car grace 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.090
 after the launching ceremony of the 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.150
 always cacon the ford design director 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.460
 from Brazil years ago explained to the 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.950
 bayern noticed the details of the new vehicle 

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:23.290
 with the staff here 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.420
 talking a little bit about the lucky ca né 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:28.030
 to work says fully developed 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.010
 here in our studio in Camaçari in 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.520
 together with engineering speaking a 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.450
 little from the front of the car he limps aa 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.240
 language that FORD has used in 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:40.110
 products that please the grid 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.870
 trapezoid positioned higher up 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.760
 is the side of the vehicle all in one 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.070
 very large surface work that 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:50.490
 transmits robustness transmit force 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:53.250
 transmit resistance to rear 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:56.220
 she was a back a simple design 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.470
 easy to read does not exist 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.090
 need for further explanation 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.160
 but is refined has details 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.210
 interesting detail here to open the 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.010
 cover means 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.430
 the idea was to work in that language 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:10.650
 more - is more understood in the sense that 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.350
 you make a design that is nice 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.030
 to watch and not tiring but also not 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.660
 boring that boring thing 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.920
 understood 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.800
 I think we think we're calling. 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:22.440
 of your spot that is the sweet spot of design 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.840
 one that is neither tiresome nor boring 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.030
 in which is the great the big balcony of 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.750
 you find a winning design and 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.750
 lasting
