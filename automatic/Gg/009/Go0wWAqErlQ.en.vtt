00:00:00.092 --> 00:00:05.328
Smash Defence in Doubles (6) Push and Defence Practice-I

00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:09.148
One of the most important practice

00:00:10.056 --> 00:00:14.275
is push and defence

00:00:14.722 --> 00:00:15.878
in doubles

00:00:16.336 --> 00:00:18.016
my partner stand at net

00:00:18.016 --> 00:00:19.023
hitting down

00:00:19.722 --> 00:00:22.854
I will defence his attack to the net

00:00:24.055 --> 00:00:26.972
this is kind of bread and butter practice

00:00:26.972 --> 00:00:29.972
every player whether regardless singles or doubles

00:00:29.972 --> 00:00:33.221
especially for doubles and mixed doubles players

00:00:33.221 --> 00:00:37.472
they have to do this one many many times

00:00:37.472 --> 00:00:39.316
with good quality

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:43.356
every body does it

00:00:43.973 --> 00:00:46.773
but the result of the practice is different

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:51.476
depending on how they do it

00:00:52.805 --> 00:00:56.273
please look my players

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.940
how they do it

00:00:58.577 --> 00:00:59.078
go

00:01:21.787 --> 00:01:25.236
if 10 is perfect

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.754
I will give three of them about 7

00:01:32.204 --> 00:01:33.797
but 3 is missing

00:01:34.453 --> 00:01:35.587
out of 3

00:01:35.953 --> 00:01:36.796
2

00:01:38.287 --> 00:01:39.276
is missing

00:01:39.977 --> 00:01:42.503
by their focus

00:01:43.502 --> 00:01:46.198
one is missing by their techniques

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.088
what I mean by that

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.901
ok watch this

00:01:48.901 --> 00:01:50.701
Perry go

00:01:53.234 --> 00:01:56.478
when you look their practice style

00:01:57.375 --> 00:01:58.557
it looked fine

00:01:59.402 --> 00:02:01.438
ok I will copy that what they did it

00:02:01.438 --> 00:02:02.737
how they did it

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:18.241
can you see any thing missing here

00:02:19.134 --> 00:02:20.988
yes something is missing

00:02:23.238 --> 00:02:24.999
the all three players

00:02:26.015 --> 00:02:30.234
use their bone and their muscle

00:02:31.487 --> 00:02:33.275
not their soul

00:02:36.016 --> 00:02:37.514
what do you mean

00:02:58.854 --> 00:03:00.536
its total focus

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.235
so all my emotions

00:03:04.611 --> 00:03:06.290
go to the shuttlecock together

00:03:10.093 --> 00:03:11.150
the stage

00:03:12.398 --> 00:03:18.447
what I want players to be in is

00:03:19.861 --> 00:03:25.113
the stage they don't have to ask them to work hard

00:03:25.852 --> 00:03:28.232
because its already there

00:03:29.398 --> 00:03:31.001
its already together

00:03:31.981 --> 00:03:32.744
opponnent

00:03:33.648 --> 00:03:34.947
his all body

00:03:35.648 --> 00:03:38.033
his all focus, emotions

00:03:38.564 --> 00:03:40.031
are together

00:03:41.691 --> 00:03:43.435
that is the practice

00:03:44.365 --> 00:03:47.998
that is pure quality practice

00:03:50.462 --> 00:03:51.364
that way

00:03:51.364 --> 00:03:55.055
there is no time to be disappointed when he hit net

00:03:55.055 --> 00:03:55.997
watch this

00:03:56.575 --> 00:03:58.036
lots of players do that

00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:10.553
every mistake he is distracted

00:04:11.138 --> 00:04:13.818
you know why he is distracted

00:04:13.818 --> 00:04:15.936
because he is not focusing

00:04:15.936 --> 00:04:17.435
he is not with it

00:04:17.614 --> 00:04:21.131
that's why he is distracted by every single mistake

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:25.326
he shows, he tells everybody

00:04:25.326 --> 00:04:28.410
I disappointed because I made mistake

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.108
but it is completely opposite

00:04:35.244 --> 00:04:36.710
when you make mistake

00:04:38.936 --> 00:04:41.336
it does not matter, he is still ready for next one

00:04:41.826 --> 00:04:42.451
and then next one

00:04:42.451 --> 00:04:43.789
it does not matter

00:04:44.407 --> 00:04:45.419
does not matter

00:04:52.953 --> 00:04:56.111
he is in a way not assisted

00:04:57.816 --> 00:05:00.037
he is with it already there

00:05:02.136 --> 00:05:04.959
that kind of quality training

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.598
is what I am looking for

00:05:08.497 --> 00:05:10.197
that kind of player

00:05:10.934 --> 00:05:12.082
I am looking for

00:05:13.282 --> 00:05:15.875
but not very often see player

00:05:16.619 --> 00:05:21.750
who put everything in every single shot

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:29.500
you may tell to me Lee its just badminton

00:05:30.494 --> 00:05:32.116
just hitting the shuttlecock

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:37.167
if you have that kind of attitude

00:05:40.041 --> 00:05:43.156
if a player have such kind of attitude

00:05:43.856 --> 00:05:46.435
he will never achieve anything

00:05:46.912 --> 00:05:47.641
why?

00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:52.837
the player who does this kind of quality training

00:05:53.301 --> 00:05:57.381
still loses many times

00:05:58.831 --> 00:06:01.276
but if you don't do this quality training

00:06:02.524 --> 00:06:04.289
there is no chance

00:06:06.996 --> 00:06:08.710
my final words

00:06:11.932 --> 00:06:14.313
your life

00:06:15.412 --> 00:06:19.155
as badminton player is too short

00:06:19.493 --> 00:06:22.673
to use your muscle and bone only

00:06:25.372 --> 00:06:26.632
from today

00:06:27.388 --> 00:06:29.511
put your soul

00:06:30.933 --> 00:06:33.330
and put your bone and muscles

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.592
use them to practice

00:06:36.224 --> 00:06:37.105
why?

00:06:37.805 --> 00:06:39.283
when you pass away

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:43.043
your body become a dust

00:06:44.805 --> 00:06:47.163
what I am saving it for

00:06:47.771 --> 00:06:52.310
while you can use it do something before too late
