 This is what happens. 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:59.780
 I usually call this a lava prison. 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:04.030
 Let me tell you about the whole lava course within. 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.030

 And now I'll explain the cucumber principle. 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:29.140
 Once you've done that last time, you'll look alike with the bitch cat egg trap. 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:31.300
 It's not just that you can only think of it when you try to do it. 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.900
 It's always available. 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:38.950

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.510
 I'm just doing it all the same. 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:08.000
 Anyway, I 'll be happy to have February next year. 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:11.150
 Anyway, if this breaks , the bank here is off. 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:18.410

 Go to the lead gate here and here . When the flower exception is turned off, 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:36.739
 We 're running launchers that contain all these lava here. 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.629
 You have to get up. 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:47.000
 You can not use it as an ultimate weapon. 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:52.660
 It is not only the supply of the State Department , 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:55.850
 Launcher. Lava flows. 4 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:04:00.920
 Let's try it.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.440
 You may be able to do this, but this should make the brand more complicated 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:38.090
 From the beginning 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:41.660
