anyway we got jellyfish in here too and
there's<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.600> snake<00:00:42.960> in<00:00:43.170> my<00:00:43.200> boot<00:00:43.590> I<00:00:43.829> mean<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.399> our

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
there's a snake in my boot I mean in our

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.860 
there's a snake in my boot I mean in our
lakes<00:00:44.760> yeah<00:00:45.570> oh<00:00:46.489> yeah<00:00:47.489> so<00:00:47.730> these<00:00:48.090> we<00:00:48.390> got<00:00:48.510> manta

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
lakes yeah oh yeah so these we got manta

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.090 
lakes yeah oh yeah so these we got manta
rays<00:00:49.020> in<00:00:49.170> here<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.410> jellyfish<00:00:49.770> know<00:00:49.980> the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
rays in here and the jellyfish know the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.799 
rays in here and the jellyfish know the
jellyfish<00:00:50.550> are<00:00:50.700> pretty<00:00:50.850> cool<00:00:51.000> just<00:00:51.510> fish

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
jellyfish are pretty cool just fish

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.389 
jellyfish are pretty cool just fish
there's<00:00:52.110> three<00:00:52.469> different<00:00:52.590> kinds<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:53.190> think

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
there's three different kinds I think

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.310 
there's three different kinds I think
there's<00:00:53.699> clear<00:00:54.120> ones<00:00:54.390> there's<00:00:54.690> like<00:00:54.809> purple

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
there's clear ones there's like purple

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.619 
there's clear ones there's like purple
eat<00:00:55.410> ones<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:56.039> then<00:00:56.820> there's<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.180> red<00:00:57.390> ones

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
eat ones and then there's the red ones

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.360 
eat ones and then there's the red ones
which<00:00:57.899> are<00:00:58.109> poisonous<00:00:58.739> obvious<00:00:59.100> there's<00:00:59.309> a

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
which are poisonous obvious there's a

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.939

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.249 
poison used to there and the matter is
there's<00:01:15.150> really<00:01:15.180> nothing<00:01:15.600> special<00:01:15.630> but<00:01:16.080> they

there's really nothing special but they

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.080 
there's really nothing special but they
look<00:01:16.439> like<00:01:16.590> underwater<00:01:17.220> airplanes<00:01:17.820> with

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
look like underwater airplanes with

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.289 
look like underwater airplanes with
weird<00:01:18.299> eyes<00:01:18.479> but<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.200> can<00:01:19.320> ride<00:01:19.500> them<00:01:20.299> yeah

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
weird eyes but you can ride them yeah

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.160 
weird eyes but you can ride them yeah
which<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.509> pretty<00:01:21.689> cool

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
which is pretty cool

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.780 
which is pretty cool
you<00:01:22.409> can't<00:01:22.680> really<00:01:22.979> ride<00:01:23.159> them<00:01:23.369> cuz<00:01:23.610> they're

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
you can't really ride them cuz they're

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.340 
you can't really ride them cuz they're
temperamental<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:24.810> think<00:01:24.990> they're<00:01:25.110> kind<00:01:25.320> of

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
temperamental I think they're kind of

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.560 
temperamental I think they're kind of
like<00:01:25.439> dolphins<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.159> have<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.400> keep<00:01:26.820> trying<00:01:27.240> to

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
like dolphins you have to keep trying to

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.600 
like dolphins you have to keep trying to
ride<00:01:28.020> them<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.350> eventually<00:01:28.770> oh<00:01:28.920> yeah<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.159> got

oh I'm not completely sure if manta rays
drop<00:01:47.970> anything<00:01:48.180> I'll<00:01:48.600> check<00:01:49.200> right<00:01:49.439> now<00:01:49.470> I

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
drop anything I'll check right now I

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.200 
drop anything I'll check right now I
don't<00:01:50.040> think<00:01:50.250> they<00:01:50.340> do<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.549> believe<00:01:50.909> they<00:01:51.060> don't

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
don't think they do I believe they don't

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.170 
don't think they do I believe they don't
yeah<00:01:51.649> but<00:01:52.649> um<00:01:52.829> jellyfish<00:01:53.460> drop<00:01:53.700> slime<00:01:53.939> balls

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
yeah but um jellyfish drop slime balls

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.709 
yeah but um jellyfish drop slime balls
and<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.899> cool<00:01:55.079> thing<00:01:55.140> jellyfish<00:01:55.860> are<00:01:56.719> like

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
and the cool thing jellyfish are like

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.490
