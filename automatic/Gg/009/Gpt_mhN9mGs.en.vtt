00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:05.090
 welcome to a new video on this channel this time it works again 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.480
 to Mac with a Mac apn 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.380
 and i've already introduced this for various white for the iPad too 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.049
 a lot for the iPod Touch 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.490
 logically pointing to the iPhone, however, I have there 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.560
 it can be closed again but the same is a post again 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.269
 and indeed it is percent in this video to rest was HD 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:25.269
 Way it is also so my percent 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.130
 make happy this time 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.619
 Percent on 7 mac reported today but there are, however, there are 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:32.550
 Men already have to 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.000
 Under UrhG is an app that says you in the weather in relatively easier 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.270
 shape 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.370
 Round in terms of graphics really extreme so in my opinion that 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.590
 Weather has Nathan is graphically the best Vacha Abdi 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.690
 Percent there is 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.700
 At least I do not have one now 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.870
 Information technology ego with the doves says graphically is nice 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:53.730
 built up 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.270
 To do this, we start the app one the whole he goes up train 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.100
 percent 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.500
 that is the app 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.850
 Percent window format 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.460
 we see here directly percent currently plans how it looks currently 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.200
 mostly cloudy 19 degrees 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.450
 that is well received 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.130
 maximum 24 degrees percent Beatrix today 11 degrees humidity at 64 percent 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.670
 Blow so spongy about 20% 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.970
 that is true that everything is happening at the moment Alicante has not 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.960
 So we are still the wind speed 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.530
 currently no hair for the k 6 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:27.980
 currently 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.740
 Percent of that is Solid reason to Diddy Kong information the first one 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.170
 Start gets so we can look at it every day is called now 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.420
 currently and today in general 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.600
 because this is displayed as normal as in general what is going on today 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.940
 on average, 14 came Hamit speed 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.490
 impossible course, then go on Friday and look nothing 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.670
 from this year Saturday Sunday Monday Tuesday 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.170
 Wednesday 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.470
 the further specified 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:54.310
 who the gate 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.320
 at 19 o'clock 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.540
 Logically enough, percentile not so likely will be Ursus weather though 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.780
 that is going to update you, too, you will ever endanger insight like that 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:03.920
 it will look like year 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.039
 0 percent chance of rain on Tuesday is a humidity of 65 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:08.849
 percent 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.680
 Percent maximum temperature 37 Depression 19 degrees that is it will definitely 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.859
 already extremely hot on this day 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:18.079
 around wind like that 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:19.510
 around the FKM hair 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.689
 Janssen all percent Mattioli and they can be displayed 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:26.929
 the nicest as I said in just these animations you have here 

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:30.069
 yes, they are always changed before it's easy to get out of Haiti now 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.909
 slightly cloudy so Committee so 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:35.279
 In the s &amp; p with wanted all inclusive also here 

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:38.539
 also mostly cloudy and nice and wanted 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:41.329
 Friday we have against probability 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:44.059
 then come on, "raindrops are the numbers around 

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:47.059
 Saturdays on or cloudy what else can you do 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:48.650
 the hammer 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.939
 unattractive his with Kross 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:52.669
 Sonja Tuesday 

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:56.369
 apparently should be as close to porn actor Hansa Rostock in any case 

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:58.109
 extremely hot on Tuesday 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.600
 and Wednesday again sprinkler Scheinig Keith 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.600
 It's going to be quite high there as well as 40 percent on Wednesday 

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:07.319
 He will look at the whole change hourly 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.930
 today 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.709
 out but Nico entered today also start watching push day go taken too 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:12.389
 now 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:15.639
 for the whole and hourly let ads year at 8 o'clock 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:17.619
 17h 11 clock 

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:19.339
 2 clock 5 clock 

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:22.120
 we'll see if how many around August 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.479
 and this website 

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:26.279
 very nice, too 

00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:27.360
 percent 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.449
 then we have here 

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:29.959
 on the card mode 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.669
 he lets himself out in front 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:34.729
 and then we are here just now wanted to quote moderate I have 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:38.109
 from getting a bit closer to that Easyjet Germany 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:40.419
 one is never a torment anymore 

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:44.089
 Per cent, barefoot Jagne carton factory pay ads and not like 

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:46.719
 Now, just like that, "Tom can get away with that 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:47.809
 wanted to get lost 

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:50.799
 Jade Close Let ads show what's up with the temperature 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:55.079
 So we decided to develop the red area that was enough 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.919
 by Anette Groth are relatively warm 

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:00.569
 yes and then the blue ones are like that 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.539
 Trump everything seems to be here or there, yes, there I would 

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:07.539
 go away from Malta, it is then cold 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:11.349
 are we both got stuck so that Nico should 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:14.209
 in the case if now a job depending on what they hired from the city 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:14.909
 Has 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:16.090
 then you can us here 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.409
 Watch MTV as that must know what the humidity Commons look like 

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:21.749
 because of 

00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:24.620
 So where is it windy from where does the wind come from 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.620
 Percent for a long time nothing Goller 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.930
 there we have kick 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.259
 average 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:36.890
 Temperature by the PKV determines the humidity an average wind 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.690
 All this did not say Kulow current 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.690
 as it currently looks and that the average request 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:43.790
 this is how we can work today 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.090
 9 then we have every opportunity 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.550
 the ends or to look at that means Telekom at home days a decreasing 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:50.789
 Goals moon 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:54.369
 yes, you can also see the dates when Hammel the full moon as on 15 

00:04:54.369 --> 00:04:56.069
 Baptized in July and with us 

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:59.629
 then he will slowly increase or decrease the percentage again 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:00.080
 case 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.370
 in Athens demonstrated faith 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.909
 yes, it does not have to be anymore 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:08.020
 then we have the rider here too hard 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.639
 which is only displayed if per Militia 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:14.120
 in order to get information about the current weather data in the case of what 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.960
 means 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.860
 for example, heavy rains or something 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.099
 and the Romands are displayed on Wanders Baums so app strong wind through the 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:23.499
 Thunderstorm with gusts 

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:28.089
 Percent of up to 4 60 km / h predominantly from southwest that means I know now 

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:31.559
 it may be okay that it was wars probability today 

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:34.559
 already quite high that it will be in the storm today with up to 60 km / h 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:39.330
 in order to praise the app will be displayed in the bar there are also directly as soon as possible 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:40.529
 the app 

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:43.610
 So the Cycon Red lights Amisia Rheine 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.189
 Danger so to speak which indicated us over the Apple with the app on ours 

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:50.029
 instead of going we will have chosen and thus a newspaper the danger 

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:53.029
 who to the case the half-strong striker 

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:57.589
 Of course, this would have to be reloaded here with accessibility Zion 

00:05:57.589 --> 00:06:00.599
 to have 

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:03.259
 to handy the possibility whole in full screen mode 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:04.120
 play 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.120
 yes also very nice on the big screen 

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:10.899
 there will be consumed all the actions little bit yes that will now in 

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:12.400
 the early CAS not necessarily 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.449
 but the animation is a little bit here 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:19.119
 Percent Pixie since that is no longer so crisp is not logical 

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:22.669
 With such a large intake of hockey smoking 24-inch iMac there it will be so 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:24.729
 be off at $ 24 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:26.819
 then that will be percent 

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:27.659
 perhaps 

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:30.150
 21 points better 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:31.770
 after 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.360
 out of it 1 go the mode 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.460
 and through the settings 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.270
 We can do this once our cities before Waltner 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:40.120
 a decoration 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.449
 Add a new city, we would like to see individual cities in the future 

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:45.089
 from Fahrenheit more ads 

00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:48.619
 or Celsius higher at the log-in, that is, we have tried the city 

00:06:48.619 --> 00:06:50.339
 indirect in it 

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:53.359
 we can hide a rogue full of miller's 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.499
 close the application 

00:06:55.499 --> 00:06:57.229
 No evidence for the case 

00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:01.349
 Notifications show Percent Craters percent strong striker that 

00:07:01.349 --> 00:07:03.559
 something to the tables and displayed all 

00:07:03.559 --> 00:07:06.990
 Percent is thoben yes that is then this red suitable 

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:10.000
 and notify a pop-up immediately if something new 

00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:11.919
 expanded 

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:14.990
 Köhler then add IP Sorry 

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:17.020
 Percent Aubry for example 

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:17.850
 or the 

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:22.130
 Heat index or the wind screen what exactly does that mean Kanduth unfortunately not 

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:23.620
 but that could only say animals 

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:24.999
 to take 

00:07:24.999 --> 00:07:28.330
 now the data from private weather station should use round the 

00:07:28.329 --> 00:07:29.830
 percent 

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:31.379
 set with slipped 

00:07:31.379 --> 00:07:32.469
 yes j 

00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:35.939
 Do not have a knee makes the most sense of the knot, "says Netflix 

00:07:35.939 --> 00:07:37.199
 So let us here 

00:07:37.199 --> 00:07:40.199
 and prevent sleeping to a window mode 

00:07:40.949 --> 00:07:43.650
 that's just there HD for the Mac 

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:45.020
 yes, that cost Merk 

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:46.029
 so 

00:07:46.029 --> 00:07:47.020
 % Cu 

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.279
 Remigius Kühnen

 Uebber who schonmal Mockus to there is also nal for the Sun as far as I know 

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.539
 vivid and forgiving 

00:07:57.539 --> 00:08:01.849
 iPod or the iPhone 4 92 year is making my legs 

00:08:02.439 --> 00:08:04.300
 I think I'll pay 

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.530
 By the way, Psystar for a really nice has if you have more cities 

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:10.900
 could we wish so yes we wanted to be dogged occurred 

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:11.699
 not that one 

00:08:11.699 --> 00:08:14.650
 Per cent of what with this video I thank you often to see 

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:17.060
 We'll see each other and write until next time 

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:17.830
 and believe
