 This Surfing &amp; Sons with factories in Hamburg and New York is OEM in Japan 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:29.410
 To make a Kawai musical instrument two choices 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.919
 It will be another brand It will be that grand called sx made in China 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.270

 It is not a great time when it was this from the movement of ne hey 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:41.379
 a This is the type of upright that has come in this time 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.880
 I tried a little while ago but I was very surprised 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:47.780
 Low temperature side 125cm 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.480
 The bass sounds as thick as it sounds like this 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.610
 Why is that ? 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:59.050
 Hey Do What a difference between the design and the material after all 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:01:04.000
 It is said that the post of usable Sands was delivered on September 10, 1994 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:09.070
 It's a piano, so it's 18 years ago 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:15.369
 It is Daikyaku like that was not caught most is beautiful 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:19.040
 Have to refrain from a little I can auto is large because it is the neighborhood say to Iide-seed Day 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:23.210
 There was also a chance that the piano also had a chance to draw a lie 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:26.540
 I wonder if you say that eh listed 9 hinge you do not have Mari cerebellum 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.880

 It is good 125 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:44.750
 I think that it means that it is a good piano with 125 cm of aplite 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.750
 787 at any time is please look at in it i that say 1 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:55.690
 It is not so much reduced There is no lie 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:02:00.729
 This is because if I say that I should give you the best seat in the head of the bullet train and I'm confused 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:05.320
 I heard that the best seats for car No. 4 came out 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:08.009
 Well that's a little kidding for such a thing and have a little adult listen 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.009

 Boo Boo Tidadin 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:42.390
 It is not a sound that stretches like Aster a but this book is too much 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:47.250
 It's because I 'm not playing and I 'm familiar with the hamburger when I'm pulling it from now on 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:49.520
