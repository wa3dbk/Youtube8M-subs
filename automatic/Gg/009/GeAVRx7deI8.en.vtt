00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:18.119
 the 2013 home collection she has it 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.250
 wanted to dedicate to its 55 shades 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.749
 let's talk about our fetish for 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.570
 excellence the heeled shoe with the 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:31.079
 steel blade is inserted into ours 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.900
 pump is not only the pampas par excellence 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:36.450
 but it also becomes a sandal with a 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.840
 very light platform very feminine 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.940
 elegantly sophisticated to then move on to 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.730
 world of the play sword because I have it 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.269
 called so because I think the plexi 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.090
 has something magical about it 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:53.429
 cinderella of the new millennium something 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.250
 of crystalline of transparent of 

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:58.920
 seductive therefore the woman remains 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.420
 raised on this invisible wedge that 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.179
 keeps it suspended in the void 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.260
 here is this is sexuality 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:06.630
 the imaginary I like 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:11.280
 red through its own colors 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.079
 cherry the raspberry color a blue 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.290
 which we call anise because 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:18.229
 this year we have dedicated the names of the 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.180
 our colors with ice creams and sorbets 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:24.450
 they take shape then 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.780
 assumes a very sexual dimension e 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.720
 very feminine and then move to al 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.140
 plateau bridge where the sole is 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.080
 inserts in the plateau outlines to the heel 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.990
 in steel as if it were a bridge a 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.670
 bridge even declined on 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.570
 a lower height that I called 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.750
 bridge in to then get to a 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:51.630
 jewel to something that in a certain 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.690
 sense unites and we have created this 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.750
 ring that goes up naturally on ours 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.000
 flip flops placed on our platforms 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.979
 on the body blade and colbacco 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.070
 even on our plateaus but 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:08.070
 even even declined on ours 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.880
 depa plexi on the flat in this collection 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:14.970
 of course there is a material at 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.070
 which I am very attached to the road 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.470
 oi the hill road or ide said so it seems 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.420
 a strange word we took this 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.450
 material from the world of glasses for 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.350
 make people understand how attentive they are 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.660
 looking for how much casadei he looks at 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.980
 discover new materials and insert them 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.340
 in your own collection 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:38.549
 this ultra modern material from a 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:42.420
 livery according to different color 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:43.950
 this effect between marble and mother of pearl 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.920
 melted together 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.370
 here I find these very modern elements 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.100
 essential to give her a look 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:56.600
 always modern that looks ahead a little 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.600
 looking towards the future
