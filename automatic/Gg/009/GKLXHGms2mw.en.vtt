00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:46.750
 I just built and that 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.280
 speakers optimized so far so far 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.570
 he was not finished that far 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.570
 was more in need of improvement 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.980
 if someone builds a box with them 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:58.180
 speakers and that should be so good 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.530
 sound like the courage after that so 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.659
 look like the ones with the same volume 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:05.320
 with its components this system 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:06.880
 as I just stop there but just stop in 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.100
 the last 20 years I optimized that 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.290
 only three weeks left 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.040
 takes a maximum of half a year and 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.040
 not more than two years 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:41.240
 when i developed the speaker 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:45.049
 must sound right first and foremost 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.939
 Actually , it's only about if you 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.009
 wrong sound is heard there is locked up 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.219
 too big sounds hollow like most 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:54.110
 speakers in the case 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:55.039
 and exactly these original ones are the right ones 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.459
 middle to find 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:01.359
 That's just the problem of metrology 

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:01.359
 unfortunately not to be determined 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:22.750
 Of course we do not find anything anymore 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:24.659
 the wheel is the only one for me 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.579
 just difference is that the 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:28.930
 Developer less in his work 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:32.290
 leave on it or not less 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.299
 focused on most mistakes 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.290
 to correct but he does that with 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:39.849
 his belong belongs to and develops 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.420
 these speaker systems august 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:45.159
 deep points coalesced nothing but he 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.720
 rejects if that does not work 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:48.040
 then he does not build something small 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.629
 a small building block or one 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.579
 small microchip or something and 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:53.530
 as does any around the corner dinger 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:55.510
 but he says less than more and 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.790
 if it is not with a few things 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.790
 then it is rejected 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.010
 really has the volume 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.540
 works because he offers problems so 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.200
 the unusual at the table audio was am 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.190
 most obvious is this 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.049
 dimensionality 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.430
 that is actually comparable 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.750
 would pronounce towards others then 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.169
 But day groups with glasses 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.599
 the fire is flat and two-dimensional 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:38.410
 and if you listen you have a romy 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:40.780
 the depth graduation of each speaker 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.389
 or every sound I say outside 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.519
 yes has a room size supplies yes 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:46.389
 also acoustically the size one 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.980
 can assign 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:49.510
 There's a helicopter flying by 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.579
 then you know there is really power 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.669
 behind the sound of someone 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:56.260
 you can hear it over a loudspeaker 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:58.840
 and you will realize what's wrong 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.440
 is not authentic enough with claudio 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.440
 But that is the case 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.629
 so in itself for such a big company so in 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.739
 to establish the trap that one can 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:11.930
 I do not know if he does that at all 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:14.720
 Maybe our kids will do it 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.870
 we as a company because still there but are a 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.940
 big companies like bwl electro voice or 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.550
 so on, so it will be a market 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.520
 Do not give up because I think that more 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.229
 the companies work together so if 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.139
 We are now able to patents 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:31.760
 which we have to make ready for the market 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:33.770
 this company and should enter and we with 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.630
 then work together because the 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.330
 big companies stay by name 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.650
 market and buy yes the small on so 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.180
 that neither his own company will be there 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.180
 you do not need that
