00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.280
 registering the brush by the bravas 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.500
 raven improve its other characteristics 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.460
 it's enough to talk about dryden 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.880
 think about driver if it does driver not 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:25.199
 is stealing the murder please talk to him 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.109
 directly to the microphone and as not

 raven counteracts all 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.380
 raven wants to keep the pressure 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.350
 raven wants to make plays driven happens to 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.020
 way of total aggressiveness a dancer 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.920
 spectral for driven driven already has the 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.780
 bloody face there is danger because I was going 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.350
 to receive driver a tooth of nador 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.140
 because he driver care driven has 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.059
 its infinite edge 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.180
 there has been a problem of lack of 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.059
 communication with that sacrifice pleased 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.449
 time for your raven team makes a 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.949
 favor the other team hahaha 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.949
 it's been worth it 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:14.820
 They should have blocked the ladies driver 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.369

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.909

 league 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.680
 driver right now driver is 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.680
 exhibiting raven is taking a 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.259
 parenthesis of driver driven is that it 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.350
 sale driven moves very well for the 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.450
 eye map to those driver rotations 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.720
 driven is giving a lesson in 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.539
 placement is pressing for the map 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.750
 driven has tied the laces and is 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:44.940

 I interviewed a great driver movement 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:54.170
 great idea is to take a driver for this 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:56.880
 departure needs as always starts 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.930

 and meanwhile driver we return 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:10.450
 immediately with more driver do not touch the 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:14.940
 mouse driver is not going anywhere and 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:18.910
 after the break the drivers 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.950

 today driven against some loser you knew 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:47.100
 that driven can catch the axes of 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.100
 other driver 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:54.540
