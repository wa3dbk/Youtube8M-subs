while<00:00:04.200> since<00:00:04.380> I<00:00:04.500> made<00:00:04.529> a<00:00:04.710> video<00:00:05.870> made<00:00:06.870> a<00:00:06.899> video

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
while since I made a video made a video

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.390 
while since I made a video made a video
of<00:00:07.379> this<00:00:07.649> once<00:00:08.280> before<00:00:08.550> and<00:00:09.860> the<00:00:10.860> video<00:00:11.130> didn't

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400

to<00:00:13.679> get<00:00:14.130> a<00:00:14.190> better<00:00:14.370> camera<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:14.849> use<00:00:15.059> it<00:00:15.440> though

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
to get a better camera and use it though

the facepiece just said it around 45
Hertz<00:03:10.159> so<00:03:10.579> that's<00:03:10.790> what<00:03:10.999> the<00:03:11.349> frequency<00:03:12.349> is

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.379 
Hertz so that's what the frequency is

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:16.809 
Hertz so that's what the frequency is
they<00:03:12.739> stood<00:03:13.069> any<00:03:13.819> terms<00:03:14.120> at<00:03:14.239> all<00:03:14.359> but<00:03:15.700> so<00:03:16.700> it's

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
they stood any terms at all but so it's

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.119 
they stood any terms at all but so it's
really<00:03:17.000> good<00:03:17.269> for<00:03:17.299> rock<00:03:17.689> actually<00:03:18.349> which<00:03:19.099> is
