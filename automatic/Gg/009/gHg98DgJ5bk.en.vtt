that<00:00:47.370> would<00:00:47.850> be<00:00:47.940> sort<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.180> immediately

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
that would be sort of immediately

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.540 
that would be sort of immediately
recognizable<00:00:49.469> as<00:00:49.559> Tokyo<00:00:49.920> being<00:00:50.219> hit<00:00:50.370> by<00:00:50.399> a

recognizable as Tokyo being hit by a

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.590 
recognizable as Tokyo being hit by a
huge<00:00:50.789> tsunami<00:00:51.059> but<00:00:51.750> Tokyo<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.680> vast

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
huge tsunami but Tokyo is a vast

agglomeration of of urban scape and it

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.500 
agglomeration of of urban scape and it
certainly<00:00:59.129> stretches<00:00:59.579> all<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.760> way<00:00:59.879> out<00:01:00.180> to

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
certainly stretches all the way out to
