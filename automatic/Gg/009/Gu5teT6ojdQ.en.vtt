00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:06.109
 At the heart of the market since her arm it's about the monster is the new 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:11.840
 Crossover is Jogi has become x5 who is the first representative of the new master 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.840
 this speech is good both on mosques 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:25.109
 the players are supposed to give the models more vitality the Namib and future 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.710
 Passivity convey the departure or the aftercare of our new 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.939
 design-philosophy 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.020
 shortly thereafter only seemingly so wild 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.520
 Parts of the movement have been investigated 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.210
 the term under which the whole people becomes 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.160
 12 dollars do not express that the future made on 106 5 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.570
 Interned the first car, this form athlete is also on the road 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.460
 will bring 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.910
 will be very influenced by a very dynamic 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.680
 Form language that the car is so promises 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.719
 Percent in motion 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.719
 put into the picture here is one of us we have to sport 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.469
 the front of the cx-5 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.890
 characterized by the large distinctive on sandy radiator grille the project 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.650
 this kind 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.450
 above all, contributes 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.450
 the striking sideline be that 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.030
 Seeing Paffett is 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.270
 was an important aspect in the development of the cx-5 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.479
 Mazda gives co2 emissions for the two-point 2-liter diesel engine 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.710
 from our 120 grams per kilometer as well as a consumption reduction of 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.490
 incredible 20 percent 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.770
 Thus, the Mazda cx-5 already meets the future emission standard EUR 6 way 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:39.800
 from the window 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.130
 you can count on 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.630
 The reports of casualties or damage to waterways have been growing rapidly 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.840
 So the playoffs are in size up to about 4% of their lunch sounds 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.640
 very popular vehicle class 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.900
 we are late 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.470
 but we are pure the technology giant 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.950
 if not prosecuted, they will wait for you 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.180
 convinced of it full success 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.390
 in the area of â€‹â€‹Dr engines 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.410
 the Kospi of the chassis a completely new vehicle here on its feet 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.469
 have asked 

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:15.949
 On outstanding percent property can be efficiently on the other 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:19.879
 Side but still pure driving pleasure from the competitor material so typical 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:20.759
 important 

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:21.849
 additionally 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.799
 Technology plays a key role in Mazda under the name of it 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:30.989
 Telegte becomes a bundle of technical innovations in engines 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.079
 Gearbox and body combined a significant reduction of the 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:39.700
 Fuel consumption and co2 emissions 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.359
 this is a step concept that comes up in the first step 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:47.539
 Lightweight construction and conventional drives sets 

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:53.109
 Later, other innovations introduced hybrid technology but we are 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:54.429
 the conviction that 

00:02:54.429 --> 00:02:58.029
 the internal combustion engine as the primary drive source in the 

00:02:58.029 --> 00:02:59.799
 automobile industry in the next 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.879
 Ten to 15 years still absolutely 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:05.110
 play the dominant role is of course complemented by 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:07.229
 Electrification is sent 

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:08.659
 it is the last point 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:10.889
 hence the greatest potential 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:14.569
 We see in the reduction of consumption across the entire vehicle range 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.669
 our flow clearly succeeded us 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:19.199
 with our new showed professors 

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:22.199
 quite a breakthrough success 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.769
 Consumption decreases significantly, for example if 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.159
 she about this vehicle 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:30.339
 to a value of 4 5 to 5 liters 

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:34.439
 under a hundred 20 grams of co2 this is an absolute bestseller of this class 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:38.120
 the whole but still with a journey ahead 11 and also to one 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:39.760
 keep it up 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.599
 The vehicles are built not to grieve unlike hybrid or 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:47.759
 Vehicles, of course, were also from the broader 

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:50.759
 the extension 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:04:00.119
 We start now with the cx-5 as the first vehicle where we renew everything 

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:03.139
 Bryce Larkin petrol engines have the transmission 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:04.719
 but that will be the basis 

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:08.939
 on which we will make another model change next year 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:12.139
 For example, Leitner calculates all these facets the next time 4 3 

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:15.489
 the next three to four years 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.870
 the whole hardened 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.959
 In doing so, we are bringing a very broad mass of models to the smallest savings models 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:22.809
 the market 

00:04:22.809 --> 00:04:26.069
 and thus have a very large potential for savings in total 

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:28.590
 Consumer at 2 4 billion 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.590
 as if you put single board Oberstaufen Tel 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.240
 important for us is the base on which we are based on 40 we are based on 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.819
 this one want 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:46.069
 what is technology we have developed, of course 

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:48.550
 the drive trains further electrification 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.699
 we work on one percent innovative 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:54.240
 braking energy recovery system but we also work in cooperation with 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.300
 annoyed the notary on the hybrid drive WM 2013 in Japan 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.650
 Inside we will be using our outdated petrol engine 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.360
 Combine hybrid technology from Toyota 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.809
 so no one-to-one action but a combination 

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:12.519
 from grief combustion engine and the British BBC World Cup on Snow Patrol 

00:05:12.519 --> 00:05:15.210
 or then according to Aladag animals 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.080
 something in the shadow of the new cx-5 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.030
 but for the brand no less important is the mazda3 of the mazda3 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.969
 Yes 

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:26.779
 in Germany but also globally our volume strongest model 

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:31.799
 September are compact percent segment percent of one of the key models 

00:05:31.799 --> 00:05:32.809
 infront of us 

00:05:32.809 --> 00:05:37.679
 The second generation has been very successful in the market since 2009 

00:05:37.679 --> 00:05:39.460
 and is now going to fall 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.540
 get a facelift a facelift for what striking under the 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:46.770
 Sheet metal percent changes have been made to the vehicle at the engines yet 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.490
 times the consumption slightly reduced the driver duo have tuned something 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:55.009
 comfortable new security percent and also comfort features percent one 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:56.240
 be offered 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.229
 the whole comes now percent 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:02.199
 In addition, in mid-October his country asked for a percent chance 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:03.719
 more information 

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:06.719
 if our ddp give Mazda 

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:08.199
 he
