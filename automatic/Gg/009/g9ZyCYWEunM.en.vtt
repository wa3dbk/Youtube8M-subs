00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:07.690
 hello that such a good day today I'm going to 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:11.320
 teach this how sakhir is sewn and what 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:15.390
 better I have been wondering how 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:19.779
 It is sewn, first of all, good you 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:22.180
 We can use this thread to the color of 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:27.330
 the bead and the spangle that we're going 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:29.280
 to occupy in this case I have blue but 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.279
 so that you do not have a little bit of 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:35.489
 style I put white 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.460
 but hey this or if they do not walk there is a 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.739
 nylon thread 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.050
 pretend that this exists in the 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.460
 work where I'm going to 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:49.370
 with being miss tourism and sequin 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:54.050
 we fix the thread and now 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.879
 well we put this the sequin is it 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.579
 also in this is the sequin for 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:01.129
 those who do not know about this plastic 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:04.460
 that's very pretty is big size 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:08.530
 because the big guy this external are 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.530
 good we put the spangle 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.690
 we put a bead 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.450
 to see if you reach it to 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.340
 distinguish it gets into the needle there are some 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.490
 narrow bandages that already brings gave him more 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.140
 large but for those who do not stand out 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.270
 well the hole is very thin there are some needles 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.580
 very very finite and these almost do not 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.020
 they like that's because it doubles and it's 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.140
 good although she is thin of small 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.870
 but if it helps me because I chose chaquira 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.050
 today and is bigger good because 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:40.690
 we put then we let you fall to the bottom 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.180
 of the thread now if they realize that it is 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.520
 the beating I'm going to do to a 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.490
 and there in the same hole where 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.460
 we put the spangle let's put the 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.520
 needle and to one side of where it is 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:57.400
 we fix the needle 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.790
 well we return it in certain 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.740
 always remember to put aside your 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.120
 It will chaquira because if you put it 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.940
 the same hole of the bead because they are 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.070
 is going to come off good now if you guys 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.050
 they want to wait a little bit separately 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.970
 we leave a considerable space 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.360
 calculating in this space here of 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.020
 the sequins 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.350
 we return to methods 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:24.370
 another other sequin 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.370
 and the chaqueÃ±a 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:32.620
 this is according to you are with the 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.150
 thing way grabbing practice is not 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.830
 despair then if you want to make a 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.880
 little theories or when they do not have the 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:42.490
 practice and we make it our chacarita 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.500
 on one side we put in the hole of the 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:48.709
 sequin 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.890
 we exalt and ready then what is going to 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.910
 make it fixed is going to be the bead 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.100
 that's what is going to make the 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.520
 sequin once is that a way 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:01.640
