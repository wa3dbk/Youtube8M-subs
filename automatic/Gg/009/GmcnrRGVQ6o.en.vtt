00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
if you want to speak to me that's fair

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.569 
if you want to speak to me that's fair
enough<00:01:48.390> it's<00:01:48.630> very<00:01:48.659> easy<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.439> then<00:01:50.159> what<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.460> do

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
enough it's very easy and then what I do

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.149 
enough it's very easy and then what I do
is<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:51.090> set<00:01:51.570> on<00:01:51.750> my<00:01:52.399> active<00:01:54.170> sharing<00:01:55.170> and

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
is I set on my active sharing and

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.649 
is I set on my active sharing and
basically<00:01:56.670> then<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.030> takes<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.329> couple<00:01:57.509> of

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
basically then it takes a couple of

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:58.340 
basically then it takes a couple of
seconds

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
seconds

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.709 
seconds

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.020 
and you'll be able to see my computer
it's<00:02:01.409> just<00:02:01.469> like<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.740> video<00:02:01.950> there's<00:02:02.579> no<00:02:02.700> actual
