00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:05.530
 Second was held in the shoulder there would be another condition 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:08.209
 according to the alderman thinks the government claims 

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:11.919
 I ever need to talk a little about shopping Sunday and I need it 

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:14.369
 need a bit of a lighter and a polyp 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:16.470
 I have a nice bowl of Senseo 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.410
 how much i want to talk to you about the fact that 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.039
 nowadays a social worker can no longer safely go on the street 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.220
 nevertheless the spokesperson 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.779
 it is just normal for the beasts if we find it good that one 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.130
 arrived and is being demolished 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.280
 that sick brothers are beaten up because all this is quickly appealed 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.380
 that promises to be much longer their work to do a job well 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.770
 so that the farmers' union got on nicely during all his things 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:44.370
 we 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.370
 especially have to accept meppel 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.960
 it is time that they ship all the boxes from so many members 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.260
 that they can make a fist that they can say there behind the windows look 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.260
 we have half a million people behind us 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.350
 what parties he's unwilling to stick out and say should be there 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.650
 legislation 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.840
 these people protected from aggression 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.940
 we all know thunder well when someone comes there his words africa 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.940
 may we approached him you will know how things are going in this country 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.630
 the netherlands is a wonderful country it has been all over and i am 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.410
 They are always happy to go back to the Netherlands too 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.050
 those kind of things 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.430
 I would rather be in America, but you will be stupid again if you have such jokes 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.510
 lashes out 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.000
 rightly so 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.810
 let's be honest 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.280
 if you have the guts to find a sick brother water balloons 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.280
 very large parks have to get along 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.750
 in personality 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.390
 six months imprisonment minimum 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.300
 and no here in the netherlands because we believe that there are still everything 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.940
 very much with soft gloves 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.380
 Especially when it comes to murder of the little ones a small church is a whole 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.920
 you know it 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.550
 sports week you get a kind of shit like in brussels 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.950
 even become a complete police 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.740
 mail becomes bollards 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.850
 neither do I baker the peace 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.070
 london police 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.060
 it's a good thing that the Rotterdam police don't belong where the dead are 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.550
 cases 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.770
 or let's face it the police sometimes made a mess of me 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.270
 generally find that the police make us guilty by the presence 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.449
 to provocation 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:17.589
 furthermore, you can't say anything about unimportance at the moment when he is certainly not 

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:19.229
 say why on the board 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:21.479
 those people only come to do work 

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:24.099
 they come to protect your things 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:25.929
 in case the lumps 

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:29.729
 yes they come to help you or your neighbor on a blanket about his illness was the robles 

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:30.839
 is 

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:33.779
 the latter became nothing like Dutch society 

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:35.069
 bo larsen 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.639
 precaution at home 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.589
 I still believe that something is wrong in the Netherlands 

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:42.169
 we are two friendly 

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:44.799
 they tidy 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.799
 we try to go in all directions but keep everyone happy 

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:53.139
 maybe it is high time to measure the tongeren baby 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:54.069
 take 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:55.799
 and that is only possible 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.099
 when a political party gets up and says young people are fed up 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.489
 I see the PVV as the designated party to make safe trips 

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:08.989
 say after clear is something I want to push through and through 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:10.819
 will print ewald 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:12.489
 if it continues like this 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.489
 a mess in the Netherlands 

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:20.439
 500,000 must be able to boys 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:22.049
 i will bag the house 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.239
 give the address when putting 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.680
 I will put this video tightly on YouTube and I will post it on 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.119
 different houses where the process 

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:33.589
 we hope you all will be so smart to forward it too 

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:35.879
 watch other regions for free 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:38.879
 just go along the way and maybe you understand what I want to say 

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:42.839
 the netherlands is a wonderful walter the must keep them 

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:45.889
 The Netherlands respects the people who help them 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:48.429
 a fireman the sick brother 

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:51.069
 how they are too important in this country 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.279
 when there is no longer a power outage, things also get stuck 

00:03:54.279 --> 00:03:57.119
 your car has been stuck for years 

00:03:57.119 --> 00:04:00.079
 what a coincidence there is a fireman with his big scissors that come out 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:00.609
 lifted 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:03.799
 mg trauma helicopter that immediately breaks out its disease 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:07.479
 but imagine the trauma helicopter is of course all about perfect 

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:09.879
 to argue 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:12.909
 I think I think it will drive you know it was all 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:14.419
 problem everyone knows 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:16.449
 but nobody does anything about it 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:19.299
 maybe it's high time for us to open 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.359
 that's why I give a sort of second 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.809
 or pre-school when came up with a cross 

00:04:23.809 --> 00:04:27.180
 you can try to get into those cultures 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.699
 you can only do that en masse 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:31.090
 to let know 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.710
 the fool 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.520
 our care providers 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.520
 indeed be able to do their job 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:40.580
 wish you all a very nice weekend 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.449
 how much more watch the films 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:45.490
 and thinks running is going very well 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.960
 also remember what you yourself get there 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.740
 if you see that happen 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.050
 I immediately have the police station 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.020
 we don't either 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.949
 do you dare? 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:59.150
 I have been doubting you myself 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.370
 would also like to go elsewhere
