00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.890
 in the video if I show you the 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.170
 the saber tooth tiger that is one 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.510
 American paper airplane folding 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.099
 the cool thing about the hobby aviator is that 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.309
 He not only looks good, but also 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.080
 Well, I'll fly now 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.949
 gradually learning how to do that 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:24.750
 paper flyers will fold first 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:29.220
 If you fold so in the middle of the page 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:33.410
 Precisely defused the edges with a 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:43.440
 Fingernail or with an object 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:46.039
 then you fold it to the triangle like that 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:55.920
 was on the other side too 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:01:03.710
 then you have already and that has then lives 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:03.710
 and when upside down then it rotates around the 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:17.159
 to fold the paper as I said do 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:21.140
 the hand then takes it we want exactly 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.140
 impulse of the paper plane turnaround 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:30.600
 that after that to get bags 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:40.619
 you should the paper plane if he is so 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:43.829
 is so hull old there is often one has 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:48.090
 You can on both sides of the 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:51.180
 finger in and out of the ducks 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:57.229
 bag from the set also here please precise 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.229
 and boss known with your fingernail 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:13.980
 that is you can have on the 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:20.790
 other side of this thicker part and 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:23.670
 for that we fold then then 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:33.569
 you can already see the paper plane 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:34.910
 here we fold the edges and sharpen 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.560
 again with a defeat 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:50.340
 with our object and the same 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:52.800
 on the other side then recognizes 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:58.940
 you already have a certain similarity 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:00.390
 optically to optimize this 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.400
 probably has something to 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:07.430
 aerodynamics then he does that 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.430
 flies up we still tilt these parts 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:16.769
 of course, also with our business 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:19.550
 Fingernail and then you're done 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.800
 our saber tooth tiger but you can do that 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:27.209
 Paper plane also a bit 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:33.180
 improve by the side is no 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:35.580
 But you have to already have always 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.200
 in my opinion quite good so 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:41.000
 and in the second step we will become you 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.980
 show how our saber tooth tiger flies 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.110
 so now I show you like our seo 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.780
 lancia we just built from 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.940
 flies it is elaborate though 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.540
 probably still great 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.799
 fly 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:58.220
 Here you can see where every corner boss flies 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.150
 is still in the air and over 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.549
 then we have you on the second 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.069
 saber tooth tiger prepared and the 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.970
 let's also peace again 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:09.510
 saber tooth tiger i wish you exactly the same 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:13.110
 good luck as the one before it goes on where 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:16.489
 around the corner is still though yes 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.489
 nice and cool
