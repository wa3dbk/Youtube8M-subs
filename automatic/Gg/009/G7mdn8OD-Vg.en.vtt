00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.380
 hello scum came out of this 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.420
 breaking italy the shock and come from 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.190
 when I don't have huge technical problems 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.750
 which I also had today so I am 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.340
 recording very late so I will try 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.680
 not to talk even faster 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.160
 than usual in an attempt to end up in 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.840
 hurry 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.430
 welcome is a family show 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.260
 in fact we immediately talk about a typical 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.140
 object that cannot be missing in all 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.570
 Italian families the iPhone 5 s yesterday 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.099
 night in fact headed the party 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.079
 because everyone had to do the 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.960
 row out of the store to grab 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.460
 right away one of the new iphone 5 if all 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.860
 journalists were looking forward to 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.719
 go out of the shops and see the rows 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.489
 of these crazy crazy individuals who 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.200
 queue up to get an item 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.000
 futile as if our life were not 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.820
 made for most objects 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.649
 futile but journalists did not stay 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.840
 apparently happy personally 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.039
 neither am I in fact, though very many 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.260
 apple store around Italy 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.030
 have indeed observed the party 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.149
 remaining open at night to accommodate 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.360
 these crazy foolish customers 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.670
 follies ok here here not even here no no 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.070
 there were that we see here no 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.750
 apparently the big lines that one is there 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.760
 waited would be the appearance in all 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.310
 Italy actually not in some stores 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.140
 only two people are presented 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.939
 in some stores there was a bit of a row 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.619
 but not as much as you can see 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.250
 from the photos that begin to circulate on 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.110
 Internet 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.659
 yesterday we are finally realizing 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.390
 that frivolous things are not really 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.430
 the salt of life and the hope of 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.020
 future but in reality it is a sad thing 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.329
 why one our economy is based 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.280
 mainly on the trade of things that 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.509
 they are not indispensable and two in the 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.909
 moment in which consumption is lowered 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.380
 obviously not of the iphone but of all 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.000
 things not just provide a bit for 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.680
 all but one of the many signs 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.579
 of the fact that Italy has long been 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.979
 within a great depression 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.689
 economic consumption and in my opinion many 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.770
 Italians understood this thing here 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.689
 the statement makes sense we don't have it 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.310
 still metabolized because to make itself 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.290
 I count the future even if you know it 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.240
 it might not be so rosy it could 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.710
 mean having to modify the 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.509
 I think it's a lifestyle 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.250
 more difficult thing to do than 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.990
 we are willing to admit talking about 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.879
 other things that happen on the internet but 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.020
 which then have consequences outside of 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.240
 internet puts 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.590
 to take pictures of your weapons from 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.050
 fire if you have guns 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.430
 especially if they are illegal in substances 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.080
 illegal if you are in possession of 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.090
 illegal substances and things of this kind 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.520
 to then slap c over a filter e 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.170
 don't throw them on instagram really 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.030
 the daily beast in fact in an article by 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.130
 a couple of days ago he points out how 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.110
 more and more people have completely 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.330
 lost the meaning of what is the 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.190
 personal dimension of sharing 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.260
 own life online now personally 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.150
 I am one who shares quite but not 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.860
 all I believe there are things that 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.480
 they must remain personal to the things they 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.950
 they can be shared but not limited to 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.280
 with the world also with friends and relatives 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.500
 for example weapons weapons everywhere is full of 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.690
 people sharing photos of weapons 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.460
 legal and illegal and even full 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.000
 hashtag on instagram that talk about 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.920
 this thing as a field and obviously not 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.950
 ends here is also full of people who 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.350
 share lots of money pictures 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.810
 money and say look how much money i have 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.760
 earned you absolutely legal way there 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.410
 I keep under the bed in this envelope of 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.180
 bread and if we combine these two things to 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.950
 example let's get to the maximum stupidity 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.110
 varol last August the new police 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.850
 york after arresting 19 people is 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.380
 managed to defeat one of the largest 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.270
 arms trade in the history of the 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.940
 big apple thanks precisely now for 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.590
 rent that through its restaurant 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.870
 he traded in arms and boasted about it 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.450
 instagram saying look at these here 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.670
 we sell guns and look at how many 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.380
 I make money and then was arrested 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.180
 as you can see from these photos 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.620
 awesome that portray a lot 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.690
 of firearms that were given to him 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.370
 taken I imagine his colleagues of 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.440
 work were glad to be 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.300
 even a policeman got caught 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.310
 day was on the internet said guarda faq 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.080
 this thing cannot be true true not 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.970
 it must be a joke but it wasn't one 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.650
 joke consequently darwinism 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.080
 continues to claim victims from the beginning 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.670
 of the history of humanity at 12 you know 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.560
 instead something that must be done anyway 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.270
 absolutely stop sharing 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.130
 on social networks the videos of the songs 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.840
 I know that many people like to see i 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.670
 music videos of favorite songs 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.620
 of their friends but they are not one of those 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.209
 people because it is with a sociopath who 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.830
 is a news show on youtube rooms 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.420
 how it goes but this thing too could 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.070
 be strongly resized as 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.320
 you know the videos on youtube 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.870
 they are managed by a giant 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.100
 company that is called live is that 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.340
 maybe you are watching a music video 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:26.010
 dei satanik court explotion skulls and 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.570
 do min to the bass puts you the commercial of 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.520
 maybe even below the video 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.960
 certainly very valuable well alive 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.660
 may soon have a competitor 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.310
 because youtube is apparently saying 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.410
 hallway rumors definitely stands for 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.000
 do it to launch your service a 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.919
 payment for the music and that would be 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.050
 absolutely sensible because it is one thing 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:45.690
 that google always makes someone see 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.370
 do something transport do that 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.169
 interesting I will do the exact same 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.030
 what is google music here 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.710
 consequently already existing google 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.389
 music is possible that the new service 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.100
 of youtube to be integrated into google 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:57.990
 music that is one of many reasons 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.300
 to join google music not a 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.010
 spotify but the point remains 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.419
 mica that the videos will become a 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.340
 payment and therefore will no longer be the 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:06.810
 free version I guess so since 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.880
 sell ice cream for two euros near 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.990
 someone who gives them for free may not be 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.190
 the best business move 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.590
 the last thing I wanted 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.360
 talk to you today scum is something about 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.560
 which I would like your opinion because 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.270
 I believe we can create a debate 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.530
 interesting and unpublished keep in mind 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.300
 which is the thing I'm about to launch into 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.099
 face is not a law that surely 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.470
 it will be made mainly of Swiss 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:27.360
 but it is a law that is proposed by 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.669
 left-wing political areas in Switzerland e 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.130
 which apparently has a broad support 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:34.440
 I'm talking about a popular one 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.690
 bill that is called relationship 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.300
 1 to 12 what this stuff means 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.460
 means that there are companies and blanc 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.020
 there are often managers in companies 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.000
 we all know that they are overpaid 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.950
 since the crisis started this thing 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.539
 many have become much better known 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.729
 there are newspapers if they are busy 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:53.550
 extreme cases in which managers earn 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:55.680
 up to 192 times more respect 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.360
 at the last wheel of the wagon is one thing 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.610
 which happens a lot even in Italy 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.620
 this initiative of the report 1 12 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.449
 would like to enter the mandatory of 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.400
 respect this report precisely 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:07.169
 which means the top manager there 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.669
 absolutely highest paid person 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:11.039
 within any company either 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:12.919
 public that private cannot be 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:15.270
 paid more than twelve times than a normal 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:17.729
 employee this for reasons of parity 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.860
 social now I know very well that it is a lot 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:21.539
 difficult then to implement a thing of 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.720
 this guy gets a lot of me already 

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:24.580
 loopholes in mind 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.350
 I wanted to discuss the idea behind 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.450
 this one that I really like very much 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:30.430
 because it seems to me a written philosophy 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:33.010
 in beautiful characters you are not 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.780
 greedy bastards point people 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:37.000
 who work for you are part of the 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.380
 your success because so many happen 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.240
 times for example klopp manager who 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.040
 the millions and millions of are paid 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.450
 euro a year and maybe then the people who 

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.950
 they actually work that they are gods 

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:46.210
 employees are paid the minimum 

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:49.030
 consequently with a proposal of 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:51.220
 this type you want increased by 12 million 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:53.080
 the year the compensation you receive from yours 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:55.000
 same company very well you have to increase 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.620
 even a little bit that pays for all 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.270
 your employees is if this thing can 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.250
 seem a little liberal 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.660
 indeed perhaps even one is 

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.580
 question of social justice and 

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:05.230
 redistribution of income because if the 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.910
 there are only a few income for money 

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:08.200
 people in the economy society does not 

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.910
 moves from which nobody spends money 

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.010
 a person will never buy 

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:14.650
 quite what enough food 

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:16.419
 enough homes enough televisions 

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:18.370
 enough furniture enough refrigerators 

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:20.169
 enough cars enough tickets 

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:21.760
 planes to be able to overcome the 

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:23.110
 quantity that so many other people 

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.890
 instead they would spend for their little ones 

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:24.790
 need 

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:26.080
 I think this is a lot 

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:28.060
 interesting I leave the link in 

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.590
 descriptions so you can go and see it 

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.150
 and then in the comments let me know what it is 

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:33.130
 think of scum I think is right 

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.570
 have a vision of society a little 

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:35.890
 more community because in the moment in the 

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:37.270
 which are four people 

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:38.650
 all the others are very rich 

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.150
 poor four people 

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:42.010
 rich and live in a world of 

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:43.210
 poor then what sense does this 

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:44.650
 scum and everything I had from 

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:46.930
 tell you for today thanks for watching 

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:48.669
 thanks to agatha who was seattle for 

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:50.530
 a very long period invested a month 

00:07:48.669 --> 00:07:52.180
 I think I would not be wrong 

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:54.040
 I'm getting old so I don't 

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.000
 I remember nothing more and it's so lovely 

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:57.190
 sent this photo directly 

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.470
 hence she is our queen for today 

00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:02.530
 I recommend comments do what you do 

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:06.400
 you want to make the good ones eat you 

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:08.590
 vegetables especially then after you release the 

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:11.050
 body with diuresis which it is anyway 

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:15.510
 important because no retention of 

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:15.510
 liquids hurt the skin
