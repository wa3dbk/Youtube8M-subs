can't stress enough how important
high-intensity<00:01:07.619> interval<00:01:07.740> training<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.520> like

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
high-intensity interval training is like

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.270 
high-intensity interval training is like
I<00:01:09.030> said<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.360> formed<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.920> foundation<00:01:10.920> for<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
I said it formed the foundation for the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.460 
I said it formed the foundation for the
science<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.729> ABS<00:01:11.850> fast-twitch<00:01:12.540> cardio<00:01:12.570> which

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
science of ABS fast-twitch cardio which

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.800 
science of ABS fast-twitch cardio which
is<00:01:13.619> half<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.040> entire<00:01:14.310> program<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:15.030> it

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
is half of the entire program and it

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.929 
is half of the entire program and it
really<00:01:16.080> forms<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.560> foundation<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:17.400> my

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
really forms the foundation of my

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.789 
really forms the foundation of my
training<00:01:18.540> when<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:18.990> was<00:01:19.229> doing<00:01:19.500> too<00:01:19.680> much

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
training when I was doing too much

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.230 
training when I was doing too much
weight<00:01:20.070> lifting<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.490> noticed<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:20.850> was<00:01:20.970> getting

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
weight lifting I noticed I was getting

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.700 
weight lifting I noticed I was getting
really<00:01:21.390> stiff<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.930> was<00:01:22.049> getting<00:01:22.259> really<00:01:22.409> rigid

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
really stiff I was getting really rigid

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.890 
really stiff I was getting really rigid
and<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.700> just<00:01:23.880> didn't<00:01:24.119> like<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.299> way<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:24.689> my

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
and I just didn't like the way that my

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.120 
and I just didn't like the way that my
body<00:01:25.049> looked<00:01:25.470> but<00:01:25.650> when<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:25.799> started

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
body looked but when I started

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.499 
body looked but when I started
incorporating<00:01:26.430> high-intensity<00:01:27.180> interval

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
incorporating high-intensity interval

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.719 
incorporating high-intensity interval
training<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.229> fast-twitch<00:01:28.979> cardio<00:01:29.009> I

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
training that fast-twitch cardio I

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.910 
training that fast-twitch cardio I
instantly<00:01:30.509> became<00:01:30.720> more<00:01:31.170> aesthetic<00:01:31.590> looking

rest<00:05:00.030> period<00:05:00.419> and<00:05:00.540> all<00:05:00.630> you<00:05:00.750> do<00:05:00.900> is<00:05:00.930> you<00:05:01.380> go

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
rest period and all you do is you go

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.040 
rest period and all you do is you go
through<00:05:01.620> 8<00:05:01.979> to<00:05:02.100> 12<00:05:02.340> intervals<00:05:02.700> of<00:05:02.820> this<00:05:02.940> and<00:05:03.210> it

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
through 8 to 12 intervals of this and it

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.659 
through 8 to 12 intervals of this and it
will<00:05:04.169> only<00:05:04.350> take<00:05:04.500> you<00:05:04.830> about<00:05:04.860> 10<00:05:05.280> total

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
will only take you about 10 total

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:07.760 
will only take you about 10 total
minutes<00:05:05.880> to<00:05:06.030> do<00:05:06.180> the<00:05:06.990> next<00:05:07.290> thing<00:05:07.530> that<00:05:07.560> I<00:05:07.710> do

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
minutes to do the next thing that I do

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.280 
minutes to do the next thing that I do
is<00:05:08.220> I<00:05:08.370> will<00:05:08.430> just<00:05:08.729> do<00:05:08.850> dumbbell<00:05:09.419> squat<00:05:09.960> jumps

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
is I will just do dumbbell squat jumps

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:11.780 
is I will just do dumbbell squat jumps
so<00:05:10.410> what<00:05:10.530> I'll<00:05:10.620> do<00:05:10.770> is<00:05:10.919> I'll<00:05:11.070> hold<00:05:11.250> a<00:05:11.340> pair<00:05:11.580> up

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790 
so what I'll do is I'll hold a pair up

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.719 
so what I'll do is I'll hold a pair up
say<00:05:12.030> like<00:05:12.240> 10<00:05:12.479> 15<00:05:12.720> pound<00:05:13.169> weights<00:05:13.440> and<00:05:13.740> I'll

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:14.729 
say like 10 15 pound weights and I'll

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:16.790 
say like 10 15 pound weights and I'll
just<00:05:14.940> jump<00:05:15.210> up<00:05:15.390> and<00:05:15.450> jump<00:05:15.720> down<00:05:16.169> and<00:05:16.410> I'll<00:05:16.650> just

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
just jump up and jump down and I'll just

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.110 
just jump up and jump down and I'll just
keep<00:05:17.010> on<00:05:17.130> repeating<00:05:17.250> this<00:05:17.610> anywhere<00:05:17.970> between

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
keep on repeating this anywhere between

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.420 
keep on repeating this anywhere between
10<00:05:18.600> and<00:05:18.630> 20<00:05:19.169> reps<00:05:19.380> I'll<00:05:19.620> keep<00:05:19.800> my<00:05:19.919> rest<00:05:20.220> times

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
10 and 20 reps I'll keep my rest times

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.090 
10 and 20 reps I'll keep my rest times
very<00:05:20.729> short<00:05:21.120> so<00:05:21.720> I'm<00:05:21.810> doing<00:05:21.930> 8<00:05:22.260> to<00:05:22.380> 10<00:05:22.590> sets<00:05:22.890> of

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
very short so I'm doing 8 to 10 sets of

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.250 
very short so I'm doing 8 to 10 sets of
the<00:05:23.340> sprint<00:05:23.640> intervals<00:05:24.030> I'm<00:05:24.240> doing<00:05:24.630> between

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.260 
the sprint intervals I'm doing between

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.100 
the sprint intervals I'm doing between
I'd<00:05:25.770> say<00:05:25.979> 5<00:05:26.280> and<00:05:26.310> 8<00:05:26.729> sets<00:05:27.030> of<00:05:27.270> dumbbell<00:05:27.810> squat

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
I'd say 5 and 8 sets of dumbbell squat

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.290 
I'd say 5 and 8 sets of dumbbell squat
jumps<00:05:28.500> and<00:05:28.650> this<00:05:28.800> is<00:05:28.919> just<00:05:29.040> such<00:05:29.310> an<00:05:29.460> easy<00:05:29.729> and

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
jumps and this is just such an easy and

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.890 
jumps and this is just such an easy and
efficient<00:05:30.870> way<00:05:30.990> to<00:05:31.020> do<00:05:31.350> high

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
efficient way to do high

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.180 
efficient way to do high
the<00:05:31.960> interval<00:05:32.290> training<00:05:32.620> so<00:05:32.740> even<00:05:32.980> if<00:05:33.070> you

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
the interval training so even if you

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.160 
the interval training so even if you
live<00:05:33.370> in<00:05:33.490> a<00:05:33.550> really<00:05:33.760> cold<00:05:34.030> climate<00:05:34.150> and<00:05:34.660> you're

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:35.170 
live in a really cold climate and you're

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:36.720 
live in a really cold climate and you're
indoors<00:05:35.530> you<00:05:35.710> can<00:05:35.830> do<00:05:35.920> sprint<00:05:36.250> intervals<00:05:36.610> on

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:36.730 
indoors you can do sprint intervals on

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.310 
indoors you can do sprint intervals on
the<00:05:36.760> treadmill<00:05:37.240> you<00:05:37.630> can<00:05:37.660> grab<00:05:37.990> a<00:05:38.020> pair<00:05:38.290> of

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
the treadmill you can grab a pair of

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.350 
the treadmill you can grab a pair of
dumbbells<00:05:38.590> and<00:05:39.130> you<00:05:39.670> can<00:05:39.790> obviously<00:05:40.150> do

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
dumbbells and you can obviously do

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.750

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:07.510 
way to get ripped and what this does is

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.000 
way to get ripped and what this does is
you're<00:06:07.630> working<00:06:07.960> your<00:06:08.110> fast-twitch<00:06:08.590> muscle

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:09.010 
you're working your fast-twitch muscle

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.190 
you're working your fast-twitch muscle
fibers<00:06:09.480> specifically<00:06:10.480> in<00:06:10.600> your<00:06:10.720> hamstrings

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:11.200 
fibers specifically in your hamstrings

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.690 
fibers specifically in your hamstrings
during<00:06:11.530> these<00:06:11.620> exercises<00:06:11.860> so<00:06:12.520> your

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:12.700 
during these exercises so your

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.970 
during these exercises so your
hamstrings<00:06:13.270> actually<00:06:14.110> have<00:06:14.260> the<00:06:14.410> most<00:06:14.590> fast

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:14.980 
hamstrings actually have the most fast

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.560 
hamstrings actually have the most fast
which<00:06:15.190> muscle<00:06:15.580> fibers<00:06:15.970> and<00:06:16.180> it's<00:06:16.300> working

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:16.570 
which muscle fibers and it's working

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:18.240 
which muscle fibers and it's working
these<00:06:16.810> fast<00:06:17.080> twitch<00:06:17.350> muscle<00:06:17.740> fibers<00:06:18.100> and

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.250 
these fast twitch muscle fibers and

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.130 
these fast twitch muscle fibers and
maximum<00:06:19.120> intensities<00:06:19.660> when<00:06:19.840> you're<00:06:19.960> going<00:06:20.050> to

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:20.140 
maximum intensities when you're going to

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.990 
maximum intensities when you're going to
start<00:06:20.320> to<00:06:20.440> reap<00:06:20.590> all<00:06:20.800> the<00:06:20.830> benefits<00:06:21.010> with

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 
start to reap all the benefits with

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.580 
start to reap all the benefits with
high-intensity<00:06:22.390> interval<00:06:22.750> training<00:06:23.020> so

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.590 
high-intensity interval training so

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.260 
high-intensity interval training so
that's<00:06:23.710> a<00:06:23.950> little<00:06:24.130> background<00:06:24.370> on<00:06:24.820> why<00:06:25.090> it's

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.270 
that's a little background on why it's
