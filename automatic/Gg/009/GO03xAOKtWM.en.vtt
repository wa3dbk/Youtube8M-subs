00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
that's bad but I've never actually

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.289

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:28.999 
though and I think I think I think I've
also<00:01:28.140> heard<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.500> can<00:01:28.680> put<00:01:28.770> them<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:28.950> the

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
also heard that you can put them in the

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
think that the cold just kind of keeps

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.550 
think that the cold just kind of keeps
all<00:01:32.729> those<00:01:32.880> gases<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.869> make<00:01:34.110> your<00:01:34.290> eyes

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
not worried about it at all the risk of

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.330 
not worried about it at all the risk of

having an egg that's contaminated that

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.150 
having an egg that's contaminated that
salmonella<00:02:23.940> is<00:02:24.180> like<00:02:24.330> 1<00:02:24.570> in<00:02:24.600> 20,000<00:02:25.350> and<00:02:25.470> also

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
salmonella is like 1 in 20,000 and also

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.710 
salmonella is like 1 in 20,000 and also
most<00:02:26.310> of<00:02:26.490> salmonella<00:02:26.850> is<00:02:27.000> on<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.270> outside<00:02:27.600> of

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
most of salmonella is on the outside of

most of salmonella is on the outside of
the<00:02:27.810> eggshell<00:02:28.380> so<00:02:28.830> long<00:02:29.490> as<00:02:29.610> you're<00:02:29.790> like

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
the eggshell so long as you're like

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.360 
the eggshell so long as you're like
cracking<00:02:30.630> them<00:02:30.840> pretty<00:02:31.020> clean<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:31.560> maybe<00:02:31.710> use

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
cracking them pretty clean and maybe use

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.390 
cracking them pretty clean and maybe use
um<00:02:32.720> use<00:02:33.720> an<00:02:33.840> egg<00:02:33.960> separator<00:02:34.350> or<00:02:34.440> your<00:02:34.740> hands<00:02:35.220> or

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
um use an egg separator or your hands or

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.370 
um use an egg separator or your hands or
that<00:02:36.180> bottle<00:02:36.540> trick<00:02:36.750> that's<00:02:37.050> been<00:02:37.260> going

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
that bottle trick that's been going

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.600 
that bottle trick that's been going
around<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.680> internet<00:02:37.740> to<00:02:38.130> separate<00:02:38.490> them

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
around the internet to separate them

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.800 
around the internet to separate them
instead<00:02:38.850> of<00:02:38.970> using<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.240> shells<00:02:39.510> like<00:02:39.690> I

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
instead of using the shells like I

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.990 
instead of using the shells like I
usually<00:02:39.959> do<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.470> then<00:02:41.280> your<00:02:41.490> risk<00:02:41.880> is

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
usually do and then your risk is

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.910 
usually do and then your risk is
probably<00:02:42.300> pretty<00:02:42.420> small<00:02:42.840> you<00:02:43.260> can<00:02:43.380> also<00:02:43.530> buy

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
probably pretty small you can also buy

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.070 
probably pretty small you can also buy
pasteurized<00:02:44.820> eggs<00:02:45.120> in<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.600> shell<00:02:45.810> and

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
pasteurized eggs in the shell and

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.780 
pasteurized eggs in the shell and
they're<00:02:46.709> a<00:02:46.740> little<00:02:46.920> bit<00:02:47.070> pricey<00:02:47.310> but<00:02:47.459> I've

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
they're a little bit pricey but I've

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.340 
they're a little bit pricey but I've
heard<00:02:47.880> that<00:02:48.030> they<00:02:48.150> work<00:02:48.300> just<00:02:48.330> as<00:02:48.690> well<00:02:48.720> as<00:02:49.020> raw

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
heard that they work just as well as raw

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.990 
heard that they work just as well as raw
