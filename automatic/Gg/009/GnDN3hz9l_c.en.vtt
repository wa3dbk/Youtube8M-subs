00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.189
 in this video we are going to observe how 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.340
 build an isometric drawing of a 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:35.020
 solid formed by horizontal faces 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:37.450
 vertical and inclined we have a 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.940
 orthogonal grid we have a 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:43.270
 isometric grid and in the system and 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.360
 Soa we have the front view the view 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:49.149
 Right lateral and top view 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.640
 let's start by identifying the faces 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:54.309
 that match with each of our 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.530
 three main planes the frontal plane 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.350
 the upper plane and the lateral plane 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.079
 right we have a first face that is 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.150
 what we have here this face as we see 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.490
 in the top view is forward 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.030
 and it has this way let's start 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.030
 draw it 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.560
 we draw first is l 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.010
 we draw the internal part counting the 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.900
 pictures that each one has 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.670
 and we got to this part 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.250
 at this moment we have drawn the 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.080
 horizontal and vertical lines 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.480
 we need to draw this sloping line 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.720
 we can not use the angle that it has 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:41.900
 the line but define its endpoints 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.570
 or its starting point and its end point this 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.060
 point and this point we proceed to draw 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.380
 the line only in the isometric is 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.380
 can do joining points 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.340
 the second face is a horizontal face and 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:03.130
 we see that in the front view is towards 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:07.240
 above that face we have drawn 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:09.990
 this line we proceed to draw the l that 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.990
 that forms us 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.220
 the next face 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.240
 it is a face that is observed in the view 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.640
 right lateral and it is to the right 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.860
 second shows this projection already 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.450
 we have this line we complete the other 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.450
 three of this rectangular face 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.240
 the next face 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.740
 it is a face that appears on the plane 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.860
 let's look at the fact that it 's run 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.890
 to 4 boxes below the top and 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.180
 from that face we already have this line 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.350
 we proceed to this rectangle to 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.350
 draw the other 3 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.940
 our next face 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.069
 it is a face that we appreciate in sight 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.590
 frontal 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:24.519
 and this face 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.470
 this four frames backwards from 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:29.230
 our frontal plane as we see it in 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.340
 this line we will then proceed to 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:36.220
 draw the shape of this from this face 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:39.880
 we go down one picture we run two towards 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:42.050
 the right we lower three pictures 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.050
 and this one 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:48.250
 inclined line corresponds to the union 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.250
 of these two points 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.269
 the next face 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.860
 we see it in the side view has 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:02.860
 triangle shape let's see that this 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:06.180
 run 2 with respect to the lateral face of 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.260
 this face we already have this vertical line 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.379
 we draw 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.890
 the horizontal edge and the edge 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:13.890
 inclined 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.750
 on the next side 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.290
 we see it both in the front view 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.780
 as in the top view as a 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:28.150
 rectangle and edge looks like a link 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.190
 how is this line inclined 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.350
 this inclined line corresponds 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.770
 corresponds to this drawn in the 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:38.320
 isometric this line corresponds to this 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.770
 horizontal line and we would be missing 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.770
 to draw 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.320
 a line to complete the face 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.520
 inclined 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:52.080
 the next face 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.080
 it's another sloping face 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.220
 let's see that we see it in profile and 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.740
 corresponds to this line we already have three 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:03.050
 lines of this face simply what 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:07.389
 we have to do is close it 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.389
 the last face that has this drawing 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:18.460
 we have it this way 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:20.650
 but this face is already built 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.210
 lines that delimit this face that do 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.740
 part of the faces previously 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.979
 drawn in this way then 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:30.310
 we have an isometric composed by 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:32.880
 vertical horizontal faces and 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.880
 inclined
