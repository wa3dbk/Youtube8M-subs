00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
now something to be aware of when you're

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.049 
now something to be aware of when you're
doing<00:00:33.739> anything<00:00:34.739> with<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.550> bottom<00:00:35.820> end<00:00:35.969> of

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
doing anything with the bottom end of

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.930 
doing anything with the bottom end of
the<00:00:36.149> ditch<00:00:36.920> it's<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.160> opposite<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:38.640> what<00:00:38.820> you

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
the ditch it's the opposite of what you

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.319 
the ditch it's the opposite of what you
would<00:00:39.059> think<00:00:39.120> if<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:40.079> take<00:00:40.760> wood<00:00:41.760> from<00:00:42.210> the

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
would think if I take wood from the

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.319 
would think if I take wood from the
inside<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.930> this<00:00:43.079> bell<00:00:43.430> it's<00:00:44.430> going<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.059> make

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
inside of this bell it's going to make

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.299 
inside of this bell it's going to make
the<00:00:46.170> pitch<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.890> didge<00:00:47.160> higher<00:00:47.940> if<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:49.770> leave

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
the pitch of the didge higher if I leave

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.240 
the pitch of the didge higher if I leave
it<00:00:50.460> as<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:51.180> makes<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.629> softer<00:00:51.870> oh<00:00:52.320> sorry

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
it as it is it makes it softer oh sorry

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.020 
it as it is it makes it softer oh sorry
love

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
love

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.569 
love
so<00:00:54.660> if<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.379> take<00:00:55.590> more<00:00:55.860> out<00:00:55.920> it's<00:00:56.250> going<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.430> make

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
so if I take more out it's going to make

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.479 
so if I take more out it's going to make
it<00:00:56.730> higher<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.270> if<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.510> need<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.840> make<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.230> ditch

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
it higher so if I need to make the ditch

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.770 
it higher so if I need to make the ditch
slightly<00:00:59.489> higher<00:00:59.730> in<00:00:59.910> pitch<00:01:00.120> one<00:01:00.510> way<00:01:00.660> of

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
slightly higher in pitch one way of

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.349 
slightly higher in pitch one way of
doing<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:02.160> by<00:01:02.219> taking<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.910> wood

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
doing it is by taking that wood

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.070 
doing it is by taking that wood
now<00:01:03.930> if<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:05.070> if<00:01:05.760> it's<00:01:05.939> been<00:01:06.090> down<00:01:06.450> okay<00:01:06.900> I

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
now if the if it's been down okay I

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.289 
now if the if it's been down okay I
don't<00:01:07.439> really<00:01:08.040> need<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.460> touch<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.970> other<00:01:09.150> than

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
don't really need to touch it other than

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.500 
don't really need to touch it other than
smooth<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.840> bit<00:01:10.020> out<00:01:10.200> on<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.740> inside<00:01:11.390> there<00:01:12.390> is

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
smooth a bit out on the inside there is

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.390 
smooth a bit out on the inside there is
just<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.869> slight<00:01:13.020> bit<00:01:13.290> here<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:13.770> I'm<00:01:14.070> just<00:01:14.220> going

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.090 
just a slight bit here so I'm just going
to<00:01:14.490> chisel<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:14.970> out<00:01:15.150> with<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.420> gouge<00:01:15.890> or<00:01:16.890> gal

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
extra long handle on it so that if I

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.770 
extra long handle on it so that if I
need<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.340> can<00:01:38.850> get<00:01:39.270> quite<00:01:39.540> away<00:01:39.869> into<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.590> dish

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
need to I can get quite away into a dish

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.580 
need to I can get quite away into a dish
fortunately<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:42.960> doesn't<00:01:43.290> happen<00:01:43.470> that

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
fortunately that doesn't happen that

00:01:43.590 --> 00:02:33.320 
fortunately that doesn't happen that
often<00:01:44.600> so

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.790 

okay<00:02:34.709> that<00:02:35.709> will<00:02:35.890> be<00:02:37.110> one<00:02:38.110> of<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.290> things<00:02:38.560> I

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
okay that will be one of the things I

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.600 
okay that will be one of the things I
found<00:02:39.190> with<00:02:40.110> digits<00:02:41.370> especially<00:02:42.370> when<00:02:42.520> I've

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
found with digits especially when I've

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.150 
found with digits especially when I've
made<00:02:42.880> it<00:02:43.120> is<00:02:43.239> for<00:02:43.600> people<00:02:44.230> who<00:02:44.530> perform<00:02:44.739> on

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
made it is for people who perform on

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.229 
made it is for people who perform on
stage<00:02:45.489> mitered<00:02:46.090> is<00:02:46.270> up<00:02:47.130> if<00:02:48.130> people<00:02:49.000> have<00:02:49.209> a

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
stage mitered is up if people have a

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.800 
stage mitered is up if people have a
clip-on<00:02:49.750> mic<00:02:50.100> it's<00:02:51.100> very<00:02:51.310> difficult<00:02:51.850> to<00:02:52.660> get

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
clip-on mic it's very difficult to get

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.500 
clip-on mic it's very difficult to get
on<00:02:52.870> to<00:02:53.140> a<00:02:53.170> thick<00:02:53.739> piece<00:02:54.010> of<00:02:54.040> wood<00:02:54.220> and<00:02:54.700> I

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
on to a thick piece of wood and I

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.750 
on to a thick piece of wood and I
normally<00:02:55.930> find<00:02:56.200> that<00:02:56.739> the<00:02:56.860> clip-on<00:02:57.190> mic<00:02:57.459> will

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
normally find that the clip-on mic will

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.560 
normally find that the clip-on mic will
do<00:02:58.560> will<00:02:59.560> need<00:02:59.769> about<00:02:59.860> ten<00:03:00.489> millimeters<00:03:01.420> or

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
do will need about ten millimeters or

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.009 
do will need about ten millimeters or
more<00:03:01.780> but<00:03:01.959> so<00:03:02.080> about<00:03:02.230> a<00:03:02.290> centimeter<00:03:02.910> so<00:03:04.019> I'd

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
more but so about a centimeter so I'd

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.350 
more but so about a centimeter so I'd
like<00:03:05.260> to<00:03:05.410> go<00:03:05.560> around<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:06.010> inside<00:03:06.910> of<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.150> bell

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
like to go around the inside of the bell

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.650 
like to go around the inside of the bell
with<00:03:08.230> a<00:03:08.260> sounding<00:03:08.860> drum<00:03:09.610> like<00:03:09.820> this<00:03:09.850> attached

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
with a sounding drum like this attached

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.430 
with a sounding drum like this attached
to<00:03:10.810> a<00:03:10.840> drill<00:03:11.140> just<00:03:11.799> to<00:03:11.920> even<00:03:12.100> it<00:03:12.280> out<00:03:12.430> so<00:03:12.880> that

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
to a drill just to even it out so that

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.020 
to a drill just to even it out so that
should<00:03:14.440> whoever<00:03:14.709> purchases<00:03:15.280> this<00:03:15.489> ditch<00:03:15.760> or

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
should whoever purchases this ditch or

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.780 
should whoever purchases this ditch or
myself<00:03:16.480> if<00:03:16.630> I<00:03:16.780> play<00:03:17.049> it<00:03:17.519> you<00:03:18.519> can<00:03:18.580> actually

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
myself if I play it you can actually

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.260 
myself if I play it you can actually
attach<00:03:19.209> a<00:03:19.360> my<00:03:19.510> to<00:03:19.570> it<00:03:19.870> quite<00:03:20.049> easily
