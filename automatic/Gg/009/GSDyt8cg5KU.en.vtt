00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
trying to get killed as fast as possible

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.639 
trying to get killed as fast as possible
say<00:01:52.649> just<00:01:52.909> go<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.149> middle<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.479> map<00:01:54.720> the

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
say just go to the middle of the map the

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.499 
say just go to the middle of the map the
only<00:01:56.009> strategy<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:56.729> have<00:01:57.030> that's<00:01:57.240> been

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
only strategy that I have that's been

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.969 
only strategy that I have that's been
working<00:01:57.750> was<00:01:58.020> for<00:01:58.170> me<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.380> just<00:01:58.560> do<00:01:58.680> laps

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
working was for me to just do laps

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.069 
working was for me to just do laps
around<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.579> edges<00:01:59.790> of<00:01:59.880> the<00:01:59.969> map<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.390> just<00:02:00.750> you

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
around the edges of the map and just you

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.310 
around the edges of the map and just you
know<00:02:01.590> whoever<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:02.100> see<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.939> maps<00:02:03.210> are<00:02:03.360> small<00:02:03.659> so

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
know whoever I see the maps are small so

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.870 
know whoever I see the maps are small so
I<00:02:04.350> won't<00:02:04.740> go<00:02:04.890> too<00:02:04.950> long<00:02:05.310> without<00:02:05.520> seeing

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
I won't go too long without seeing

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.270 
I won't go too long without seeing
somebody<00:02:06.329> for<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.570> kill<00:02:06.810> because<00:02:07.710> what<00:02:08.160> you

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
somebody for a kill because what you

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.710

other side I knew when it spawns one
fled<00:02:54.360> I<00:02:54.540> knew<00:02:54.690> when<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:54.960> spawns<00:02:55.230> weren't

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
fled I knew when the spawns weren't

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.410

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
spawn system but there's nothing that

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.830 
spawn system but there's nothing that
you<00:03:20.040> can<00:03:20.190> do<00:03:20.310> about<00:03:20.400> that<00:03:20.580> and<00:03:21.000> another<00:03:21.540> thing

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
you can do about that and another thing

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.390 
you can do about that and another thing
that<00:03:21.870> you<00:03:22.020> can't<00:03:22.530> really<00:03:22.680> avoid<00:03:22.980> is<00:03:23.190> getting

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
that you can't really avoid is getting

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.130 
that you can't really avoid is getting
shot<00:03:23.580> in<00:03:23.670> the<00:03:23.700> back<00:03:23.760> like<00:03:24.630> me

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
shot in the back like me

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.390 
shot in the back like me
I<00:03:25.170> found<00:03:25.530> myself<00:03:25.680> because<00:03:26.130> I<00:03:26.190> put<00:03:26.370> a

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
I found myself because I put a

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.260 
I found myself because I put a
sensitivity<00:03:26.970> turning<00:03:27.510> around<00:03:27.600> a<00:03:27.870> lot<00:03:28.340> but<00:03:29.340> it

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
sensitivity turning around a lot but it

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.000 
sensitivity turning around a lot but it
seemed<00:03:30.570> like<00:03:30.600> ever<00:03:30.990> you<00:03:31.260> ever<00:03:31.380> go<00:03:31.620> somewhere

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
seemed like ever you ever go somewhere
