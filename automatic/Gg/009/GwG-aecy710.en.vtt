benefit<00:00:38.879> of<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.030> program<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.660> we<00:00:39.870> have

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
benefit of the program is that we have

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.450

the<00:00:40.140> academic<00:00:40.649> side<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.829> things<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:41.250> think

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
the academic side of things I think

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.250 
the academic side of things I think
junior<00:00:41.640> hockey<00:00:41.879> straight<00:00:42.300> but<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:42.930> think<00:00:43.170> the

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
junior hockey straight but I think the

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.630 
junior hockey straight but I think the
balance<00:00:43.440> between<00:00:43.680> athletics<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.520> academics

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
balance between athletics and academics

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.279 
balance between athletics and academics
is<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.329> key<00:00:45.510> piece<00:00:45.690> when<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:45.989> comes<00:00:46.140> to

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
is the key piece when it comes to

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.200 
is the key piece when it comes to
College<00:00:46.620> we<00:00:46.860> want<00:00:47.039> guys<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.219> be<00:00:47.550> successful<00:00:47.730> in
