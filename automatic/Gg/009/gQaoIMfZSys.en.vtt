I could hear Lulu on the edge of the bed

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:04.870 
I could hear Lulu on the edge of the bed
going<00:05:01.270> and<00:05:02.590> I<00:05:03.590> thought<00:05:03.860> there<00:05:04.310> must<00:05:04.580> be

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
going and I thought there must be

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.720 
going and I thought there must be
something<00:05:05.480> down<00:05:05.690> there<00:05:06.050> Lulu<00:05:06.860> was<00:05:07.100> right<00:05:07.400> the

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.990 
I think her heightened sense of smell
and<00:05:11.120> hearing<00:05:12.580> indicated<00:05:13.580> to<00:05:13.760> her<00:05:13.970> that

they<00:05:58.699> had<00:05:58.849> done<00:05:59.000> for<00:05:59.210> their<00:05:59.360> little<00:05:59.659> dog<00:05:59.840> a<00:06:00.139> few

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:00.590 
they had done for their little dog a few

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.029 
they had done for their little dog a few
years<00:06:00.889> earlier<00:06:01.069> I<00:06:01.690> had<00:06:02.690> saved<00:06:03.020> her<00:06:03.409> life<00:06:03.680> and

years earlier I had saved her life and

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:06.309 
years earlier I had saved her life and
now<00:06:04.580> she<00:06:04.639> turned<00:06:05.150> around<00:06:05.330> and<00:06:05.659> saved<00:06:05.990> our

so<00:06:07.310> I<00:06:07.580> guess<00:06:08.150> we're<00:06:08.389> even<00:06:08.599> although<00:06:09.500> I<00:06:09.860> give

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
so I guess we're even although I give

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:16.480 
so I guess we're even although I give
her<00:06:10.490> a<00:06:10.520> few<00:06:10.819> more<00:06:11.000> points<00:06:13.569> and<00:06:15.069> so<00:06:16.069> this<00:06:16.310> little

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:16.490 
her a few more points and so this little

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.460 
her a few more points and so this little
