was<00:02:14.940> nice<00:02:15.269> that<00:02:15.480> during<00:02:15.750> cutscenes<00:02:16.230> the

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
was nice that during cutscenes the

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.720 
was nice that during cutscenes the
characters<00:02:16.800> actually<00:02:17.190> spoke<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:17.610> whole

characters actually spoke the whole

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.399 
characters actually spoke the whole
dialogue<00:02:18.180> instead<00:02:18.420> of<00:02:18.690> just<00:02:18.870> a<00:02:18.989> few<00:02:19.170> phrases

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
dialogue instead of just a few phrases

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:21.530

like<00:02:19.620> they<00:02:19.890> did<00:02:20.069> in<00:02:20.159> second<00:02:20.459> opinion<00:02:20.879> it<00:02:21.239> helps

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
like they did in second opinion it helps

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.570

and Nunchuk to use surgical tools was

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:30.830 
and Nunchuk to use surgical tools was
easy<00:02:29.040> however<00:02:29.760> I<00:02:29.849> still<00:02:30.209> don't<00:02:30.390> understand

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840

how<00:02:30.989> suturing<00:02:31.500> works

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
how suturing works

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.770 
how suturing works
I<00:02:31.950> read<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:32.549> have<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:32.819> quickly<00:02:33.060> zigzag<00:02:33.599> your

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
I read you have to quickly zigzag your

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.690 
I read you have to quickly zigzag your
way<00:02:33.900> over<00:02:34.230> a<00:02:34.260> wound<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:34.650> close<00:02:34.890> it<00:02:35.069> up<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:35.490> I

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
way over a wound to close it up and I

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.460 
way over a wound to close it up and I
feel<00:02:35.910> like<00:02:36.030> I'm<00:02:36.180> doing<00:02:36.450> just<00:02:36.630> that<00:02:36.780> but<00:02:37.410> I

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
feel like I'm doing just that but I

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.460 
feel like I'm doing just that but I
usually<00:02:37.920> end<00:02:38.069> up<00:02:38.160> getting

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
usually end up getting

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.650 
usually end up getting
the<00:02:38.530> bad<00:02:38.770> or<00:02:39.040> okay<00:02:39.430> ranking<00:02:39.880> it's<00:02:40.300> especially

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
the bad or okay ranking it's especially

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.150 
the bad or okay ranking it's especially
difficult<00:02:40.990> if<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.620> wound<00:02:41.800> is<00:02:41.920> lain

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
difficult if the wound is lain

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.980 
difficult if the wound is lain
horizontal<00:02:42.850> because<00:02:43.210> zigzagging<00:02:43.780> the

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
horizontal because zigzagging the

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.240 
horizontal because zigzagging the
Wiimote<00:02:44.290> up<00:02:44.470> and<00:02:44.650> down<00:02:44.800> instead<00:02:45.130> of

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
Wiimote up and down instead of

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.190 
Wiimote up and down instead of
left-to-right<00:02:45.850> is<00:02:46.090> much<00:02:46.330> more<00:02:46.510> difficult<00:02:46.750> and

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
left-to-right is much more difficult and

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.720 
left-to-right is much more difficult and
would<00:02:47.410> almost<00:02:47.620> always<00:02:48.010> give<00:02:48.340> me<00:02:48.460> a<00:02:48.490> bad

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
would almost always give me a bad

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.580 
would almost always give me a bad
ranking<00:02:49.180> everything<00:02:49.900> else<00:02:50.050> though<00:02:50.290> like

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
ranking everything else though like

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.440 
ranking everything else though like
using<00:02:50.800> the<00:02:50.980> defibrillator<00:02:51.280> or<00:02:51.880> the<00:02:52.000> forceps

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
using the defibrillator or the forceps

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.520 
using the defibrillator or the forceps
were<00:02:52.720> just<00:02:53.020> fine

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
were just fine

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.500 
were just fine
like<00:02:53.890> second<00:02:54.250> opinion<00:02:54.670> it<00:02:54.880> can<00:02:55.030> be<00:02:55.150> very

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
like second opinion it can be very

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.150 
like second opinion it can be very
difficult<00:02:55.810> to<00:02:56.110> receive<00:02:56.470> anything<00:02:56.800> higher

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
difficult to receive anything higher

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.950 
difficult to receive anything higher
than<00:02:57.400> a<00:02:57.430> final<00:02:57.820> grade<00:02:57.970> of<00:02:58.150> C<00:02:58.360> for<00:02:58.600> each<00:02:58.630> mission

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960

than a final grade of C for each mission
Lizzy<00:02:59.800> and<00:02:59.860> I<00:02:59.950> played<00:03:00.190> on<00:03:00.220> Normal<00:03:00.670> difficulty

Lizzy and I played on Normal difficulty
and<00:03:01.450> we<00:03:01.570> could<00:03:01.750> not<00:03:01.900> get<00:03:02.110> a<00:03:02.170> great<00:03:02.470> higher<00:03:02.710> than

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
and we could not get a great higher than

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.280 
and we could not get a great higher than
a<00:03:03.010> C<00:03:03.280> you<00:03:03.820> have<00:03:03.970> to<00:03:04.090> play<00:03:04.240> fast<00:03:04.600> but<00:03:04.930> super

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
a C you have to play fast but super

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.260

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.460 
makes it look like time slows down the
healing<00:03:27.970> touch<00:03:28.270> only<00:03:28.510> lasts<00:03:28.930> a<00:03:28.959> very<00:03:28.990> short

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
healing touch only lasts a very short

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.050 
healing touch only lasts a very short
time<00:03:29.709> and<00:03:29.740> you<00:03:30.100> can<00:03:30.250> only<00:03:30.400> do<00:03:30.610> it<00:03:30.730> once<00:03:30.940> per

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
time and you can only do it once per

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.850 
time and you can only do it once per
mission<00:03:31.390> so<00:03:31.750> use<00:03:31.930> it<00:03:31.959> only<00:03:32.230> when<00:03:32.500> you<00:03:32.650> need<00:03:32.830> to

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
mission so use it only when you need to

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.160 
mission so use it only when you need to
however<00:03:33.520> like<00:03:34.000> I<00:03:34.120> said<00:03:34.330> earlier<00:03:34.660> this<00:03:34.930> game

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
however like I said earlier this game

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.260 
however like I said earlier this game
can<00:03:35.320> be<00:03:35.350> very<00:03:35.470> difficult<00:03:35.920> so<00:03:36.550> much<00:03:36.790> so<00:03:37.030> that

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.270 
can be very difficult so much so that

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:38.760 
can be very difficult so much so that
there<00:03:37.420> were<00:03:37.540> times<00:03:37.810> when<00:03:37.959> even<00:03:38.200> using<00:03:38.680> the

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
there were times when even using the

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.770 
there were times when even using the
Healing<00:03:39.100> Touch<00:03:39.280> wasn't<00:03:39.730> enough<00:03:39.970> you<00:03:40.450> really

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
Healing Touch wasn't enough you really

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.390 
Healing Touch wasn't enough you really
have<00:03:40.959> to<00:03:41.080> bring<00:03:41.230> your<00:03:41.410> a-game<00:03:41.590> if<00:03:41.830> you<00:03:42.070> want<00:03:42.280> to

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
have to bring your a-game if you want to

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.160 
have to bring your a-game if you want to
succeed<00:03:42.580> this<00:03:43.330> game<00:03:43.540> doesn't<00:03:43.870> seem<00:03:43.989> as

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
succeed this game doesn't seem as

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.050 
succeed this game doesn't seem as
difficult<00:03:44.650> a<00:03:44.769> second<00:03:45.070> opinion<00:03:45.340> but<00:03:45.760> I<00:03:45.790> think

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
difficult a second opinion but I think

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.550 
difficult a second opinion but I think
that<00:03:46.209> may<00:03:46.330> be<00:03:46.360> due<00:03:46.630> to<00:03:46.660> the<00:03:46.750> fact<00:03:47.050> that<00:03:47.170> Lizzie

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
that may be due to the fact that Lizzie

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.199 
that may be due to the fact that Lizzie
was<00:03:47.709> playing<00:03:48.010> with<00:03:48.190> me<00:03:48.400> for<00:03:48.580> most<00:03:48.730> of<00:03:48.910> the<00:03:49.000> time

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
was playing with me for most of the time

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.850 
was playing with me for most of the time
which<00:03:49.720> really<00:03:49.750> dropped<00:03:50.260> the<00:03:50.320> difficulty

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
which really dropped the difficulty

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.410 
which really dropped the difficulty
level<00:03:51.160> but<00:03:51.430> it's<00:03:51.550> still<00:03:51.790> nowhere<00:03:52.030> near<00:03:52.239> a

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
level but it's still nowhere near a

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.840 
level but it's still nowhere near a
pushover<00:03:52.900> trauma<00:03:53.709> center<00:03:54.100> new<00:03:54.370> blood<00:03:54.610> is<00:03:54.820> a

pushover trauma center new blood is a

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.640 
pushover trauma center new blood is a
good<00:03:55.120> game<00:03:55.360> but<00:03:55.690> only<00:03:55.870> if<00:03:56.050> we're<00:03:56.230> prepared<00:03:56.590> to

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
good game but only if we're prepared to

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.560 
good game but only if we're prepared to
be<00:03:56.830> challenged<00:03:57.310> on<00:03:57.430> your<00:03:57.550> skills<00:03:57.910> patience

with you is very helpful and makes the
game<00:04:04.300> more<00:04:04.600> enjoyable<00:04:04.780> but<00:04:05.620> it's<00:04:05.800> still<00:04:05.980> very

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
game more enjoyable but it's still very

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.530 
game more enjoyable but it's still very
frustrating<00:04:06.820> that<00:04:06.940> it<00:04:07.060> can<00:04:07.180> be<00:04:07.269> very

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
frustrating that it can be very

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.180 
frustrating that it can be very
difficult<00:04:07.810> to<00:04:08.200> get<00:04:08.290> a<00:04:08.350> ranking<00:04:08.769> that's<00:04:08.950> higher

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
difficult to get a ranking that's higher

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.460 
difficult to get a ranking that's higher
than<00:04:09.430> a<00:04:09.459> C<00:04:09.760> the<00:04:10.299> story<00:04:10.600> and<00:04:10.780> voice<00:04:10.930> acting<00:04:11.350> are

great<00:04:11.680> and<00:04:11.950> it's<00:04:12.130> very<00:04:12.190> nice<00:04:12.549> that<00:04:12.760> the

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
great and it's very nice that the

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.640 
great and it's very nice that the
characters<00:04:13.269> actually<00:04:13.480> speak<00:04:13.959> every<00:04:14.260> sentence

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650

I<00:04:16.870> recommend<00:04:17.560> this<00:04:17.650> game<00:04:17.830> to<00:04:18.010> those<00:04:18.190> who<00:04:18.340> only
