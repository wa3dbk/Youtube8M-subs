00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:02.400
 at his last flyby 

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.730
 so Goertz he at an altitude of only 8000 kilometers as the clouds of the 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:07.830
 planet 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.030
 Never before has a probe been so close 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.030
 flew past a larger planet 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:22.850
 a few hours later 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.439
 met the spacecraft Triton 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.669
 he is the greatest of Neptune 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:32.679
 with minus 230 degrees Celsius on the satellite surface 

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:35.679
 he is the coldest body in our solar system 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.490
 the overall picture of Neptune and shows in contrast to Buranus 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.550
 how pronounced were structures 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.020
 The atmosphere here too consists of hydrogen and helium 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.550
 have a small share 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.700
 This is also the explanation for the blue color 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.450
 it arises by absorbing it's properties of this atmosphere 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.200
 the temperatures in this atmosphere are not lower than those of the game 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.870
 the planet Uranus 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.870
 although it is much further away from the sun 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.960
 like Jupiter and Saturn and the opposite of pure new 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.890
 until now do not do a similar source of energy 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.810
 as in his case, the sun and the second time 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.950
 seven times 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.950
 Outstanding is the big dark spot 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.330
 a gigantic just wanted to Spoerri with a rotation or 16 of hers 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.070
 Acts seen against the percent 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.840
 This is well understood by the CIOs who wanted structures of the infected 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.500
 Let's look at a Neptune satellite 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.510
 in addition to the known ones 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.310
 Â«In the war and I had the idea 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.410
 By the way, six new ones were discovered 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.410
 This is Triton the biggest with tumors 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.530
 he is one of the most interesting satellites of our solar system 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.160
 arise through his complicated goods movements and Neptune 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.210
 Seasons 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.439
 which were hundreds of horse years ago 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:19.269
 currently the sun is high above the South Pole chapel of frozen 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:20.129
 nitrogen 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.079
 the last Triton winter 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:23.399
 originated there 

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:26.399
 Beijing 10 left lower part of the loan 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:30.769
 the sunlight lets the polar ice caps evaporate 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.789
 and leads to waving to the northern hemisphere 

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:36.249
 the winter service earth are addressed 

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:39.249
 There is currently in the new Polo Cup will be 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.790
 like black deposits of nitrogen-powered geysers 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.569
 the diaper visible 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.799
 they are clearly visible in these pictures 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.799
 At least two active core she advises clients while it is flyby 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.799
 be identified 

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:03.090
 the northern hemisphere of Triton 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.430
 is characterized by strange surface structures 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:11.450
 they evoke similar surfaces forms in the permafrost of the elegiac 

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:14.449
 Sound three areas that are a thousand times smaller 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.959
 after Wollscheid 2 on all outer planets up to and including mittun 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.090
 flew by and returned unique images and scientific data back to Earth 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.859
 sent 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:33.989
 Now she will disappear forever into the great empty space 

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:43.619
 Unfortunately, she could not make a detour to bleeding go out of branches 

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:45.030
 our solar system 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.310
 the only and not by space probes visit the plan lies 

00:03:49.279 --> 00:03:52.759
 no flyby is planned for the foreseeable future 

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:55.759
 and we can only access telescope recording 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:57.409
 also classic 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:01.450
 The astronomical process, for example, draws star coverings help us 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:04.449
 to some information 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:11.589
 This picture gives you almost new insights about Pluto and its big satellites 

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:13.499
 Sharon together 

00:04:13.499 --> 00:04:16.499
 both consist for the most part of water ice and rock 

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:20.159
 they make a kind of dirty 1 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.539
 the bleeding surface results in frozen ride 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:30.099
 that is reflected by the and woman now prudent and the cosmic rays 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:33.099
 discolored thoroughly 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:42.289
 the lesser gravity Sharon 1 Wiest believes that with as escape 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:45.289
 that a layer of water ice was exposed 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:51.699
 Pluto and should have strong seasons 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.349
 a comparison with the Neptune Moon Triton shows 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:57.990
 that both bodies are extremely similar 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.220
 differ in great sun distance in the Licher way 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.139
 have arisen 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:06.219
 Triton was later captured by Neptune 

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:10.149
 while Tutto became the disintegrating planet of our solar system 

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:18.469
 divide the light we know from the earth 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.080
 thanks to the German mission as interesting 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.229
 l kidnapped new worlds 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:26.249
 WunderWelten 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:29.249
 Chemistry and geology 

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:33.900
 many things are extremely hard for us 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.729
 and it will probably stay long
