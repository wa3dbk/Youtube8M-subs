imagine<00:00:00.659> being<00:00:01.589> stranded<00:00:01.979> with<00:00:02.490> your<00:00:02.669> car<00:00:02.879> at

imagine being stranded with your car at

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.550 
imagine being stranded with your car at
the<00:00:03.090> side<00:00:03.300> of<00:00:03.389> the<00:00:03.480> road<00:00:03.659> the<00:00:04.200> car<00:00:04.410> won't<00:00:04.620> move

the side of the road the car won't move

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.650 
the side of the road the car won't move
obviously<00:00:07.560> there's<00:00:08.429> a<00:00:08.490> difference<00:00:08.550> between<00:00:09.420> a

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
obviously there's a difference between a

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
and a car with a broken engine you need

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.510 
and a car with a broken engine you need
