00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
going to start with the less exciting of

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.620 
going to start with the less exciting of
the<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.619> ipad<00:00:23.130> for<00:00:23.460> although<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:24.240> is<00:00:24.330> kind

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
the to the ipad for although it is kind

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.570 
the to the ipad for although it is kind
of<00:00:24.689> exciting<00:00:24.960> because<00:00:25.320> it's<00:00:25.619> it's<00:00:25.859> faster<00:00:26.400> and

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
of exciting because it's it's faster and

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.859 
of exciting because it's it's faster and
the<00:00:26.609> ipad<00:00:27.390> 3<00:00:27.779> with<00:00:28.500> all<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.800> those<00:00:28.949> pixels<00:00:29.429> is

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
the ipad 3 with all of those pixels is

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.510 
the ipad 3 with all of those pixels is
slaggy<00:00:30.869> at<00:00:31.140> times<00:00:31.439> when<00:00:31.890> opening<00:00:32.279> apps

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
slaggy at times when opening apps

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.850 
slaggy at times when opening apps
sometimes<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.090> stutters<00:00:33.420> it's<00:00:33.600> not<00:00:34.110> as<00:00:34.380> smooth

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
sometimes it stutters it's not as smooth

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.639 
sometimes it stutters it's not as smooth
performance<00:00:35.640> wise<00:00:36.000> as<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.480> should<00:00:36.719> be<00:00:36.899> so<00:00:37.380> it's

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
performance wise as it should be so it's

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.440 
performance wise as it should be so it's
nice<00:00:37.829> that<00:00:37.860> apple<00:00:38.250> finally<00:00:38.399> put<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.850> 6<00:00:39.090> chip<00:00:39.329> in

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
nice that apple finally put a 6 chip in

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.410 
nice that apple finally put a 6 chip in
there<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:40.020> course<00:00:40.410> we<00:00:40.680> also<00:00:40.920> get<00:00:41.489> the

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
there of course we also get the

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.180 
there of course we also get the
Lightning<00:00:42.780> connector<00:00:42.899> again<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.160> a

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
Lightning connector again this is a

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.680 
Lightning connector again this is a
minor<00:00:44.579> refresh<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.090> lot<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.420> people<00:00:45.600> are

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
minor refresh a lot of people are

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.330 
minor refresh a lot of people are
actually<00:00:45.780> pretty<00:00:46.110> upset<00:00:46.530> echo<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.129> at<00:00:47.219> least

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
actually pretty upset echo and at least

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
a fourth-generation ipad in the middle

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.119 
a fourth-generation ipad in the middle
of<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.579> year<00:00:51.050> but<00:00:52.050> hey<00:00:52.379> let's<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:52.890> let's<00:00:52.920> see

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
of the year but hey let's so let's see

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.580 
of the year but hey let's so let's see
what<00:00:53.250> we<00:00:53.309> have<00:00:55.940> so<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.480> Wi-Fi<00:00:57.930> 16

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
what we have so this is the Wi-Fi 16

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.650 
what we have so this is the Wi-Fi 16
gigabyte<00:00:59.160> version<00:00:59.270> we're<00:01:00.270> going<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.420> have<00:01:00.629> a

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
gigabyte version we're going to have a

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.590 
gigabyte version we're going to have a
speed<00:01:01.199> comparison<00:01:01.770> up<00:01:01.859> very<00:01:02.160> soon<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.730> am<00:01:03.270> so

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
speed comparison up very soon I am so

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.140 
speed comparison up very soon I am so
curious<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.260> see<00:01:04.650> how<00:01:05.159> much<00:01:05.369> faster<00:01:05.820> this<00:01:05.970> is

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
curious to see how much faster this is

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.480 
curious to see how much faster this is
then<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.390> ipad<00:01:06.780> 3<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.350> let's<00:01:08.010> just<00:01:08.250> take<00:01:08.460> a

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
then the ipad 3 and let's just take a

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.149 
then the ipad 3 and let's just take a
quick<00:01:08.790> look<00:01:09.030> at<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.240> hardware<00:01:09.950> another<00:01:10.950> thing

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
quick look at the hardware another thing

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.260 
quick look at the hardware another thing
that<00:01:11.189> people<00:01:11.520> really<00:01:11.640> aren't<00:01:11.850> talking<00:01:12.240> about

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
that people really aren't talking about

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.120 
that people really aren't talking about
is<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.689> ipad<00:01:12.810> 4<00:01:13.290> should<00:01:13.530> have<00:01:13.740> slightly

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
is that the ipad 4 should have slightly

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.060 
is that the ipad 4 should have slightly
better<00:01:14.369> battery<00:01:14.760> life<00:01:14.850> then<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.930> ipad<00:01:16.470> 3

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
better battery life then the ipad 3

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.340 
better battery life then the ipad 3
because<00:01:17.790> it's<00:01:17.939> got<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.150> a6<00:01:18.509> chip<00:01:18.810> which<00:01:19.080> uses

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
because it's got the a6 chip which uses

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.890 
because it's got the a6 chip which uses
a<00:01:19.380> smaller<00:01:19.740> manufacturing<00:01:20.580> process<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.330> thus

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
a smaller manufacturing process and thus

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.630 
a smaller manufacturing process and thus
requires<00:01:22.350> less<00:01:22.619> power<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:23.100> run<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.490> that's

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
requires less power to run so that's

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.190 
requires less power to run so that's
something<00:01:23.820> I'm<00:01:23.970> looking<00:01:24.180> forward<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.540> the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
something I'm looking forward to the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.499 
something I'm looking forward to the
battery<00:01:25.470> iPhone<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.770> iPad<00:01:25.920> 3<00:01:26.460> is<00:01:26.729> pretty<00:01:27.210> good

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
battery iPhone the iPad 3 is pretty good

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.350 
battery iPhone the iPad 3 is pretty good
but<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.799> always<00:01:29.100> could<00:01:29.369> be<00:01:29.490> better<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:30.060> let's

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
but it always could be better so let's

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.770 
but it always could be better so let's
open<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:31.110> up<00:01:31.170> here<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:32.030> we<00:01:33.030> get<00:01:33.210> an<00:01:33.299> ipad<00:01:33.630> of

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
open this up here and we get an ipad of

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.910 
open this up here and we get an ipad of
course<00:01:33.810> it's<00:01:34.200> going<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.409> look<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.710> same

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
course it's going to look the same

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.100 
course it's going to look the same
except<00:01:35.689> of<00:01:36.689> course<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.380> has<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:39.110> lightning

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
except of course that it has a lightning

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.120 
except of course that it has a lightning
connector<00:01:41.240> on<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.780> bottom<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.860> looks

now<00:02:13.040> a<00:02:13.069> problem<00:02:13.580> is<00:02:13.700> plagued<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.150> iPad<00:02:14.569> since

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
now a problem is plagued the iPad since

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.809 
now a problem is plagued the iPad since
the<00:02:15.140> beginning<00:02:15.530> is<00:02:15.650> that<00:02:15.830> it's<00:02:15.980> just<00:02:16.189> been<00:02:16.459> too

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
the beginning is that it's just been too

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.509 
the beginning is that it's just been too
thick<00:02:17.239> and<00:02:17.480> too<00:02:17.540> heavy<00:02:18.470> it's<00:02:19.069> not<00:02:19.310> really

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
thick and too heavy it's not really

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.759 
thick and too heavy it's not really
conducive<00:02:19.849> to<00:02:20.209> reading<00:02:20.750> for<00:02:20.989> long<00:02:21.170> periods<00:02:21.200> of

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
conducive to reading for long periods of

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.069 
conducive to reading for long periods of
time<00:02:21.829> because<00:02:22.760> it<00:02:22.790> just<00:02:23.000> fatigues<00:02:23.450> your<00:02:23.720> hands

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:24.079 
time because it just fatigues your hands

awesome experience and now we've got an

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.000 
awesome experience and now we've got an
iPad<00:02:33.920> that<00:02:34.670> has<00:02:34.879> those<00:02:35.209> same<00:02:36.140> merits<00:02:36.590> by<00:02:36.799> being

days so this is the black version I got
the<00:02:47.870> black<00:02:48.079> version<00:02:48.349> instead<00:02:49.280> of<00:02:49.370> the<00:02:49.430> white

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
version I always go with white but this

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.390 
version I always go with white but this
time<00:02:51.079> i<00:02:51.170> went<00:02:51.260> with<00:02:51.349> black<00:02:51.620> because

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
the bottom with the lightning connector

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.270 
the bottom with the lightning connector
and<00:04:18.049> i'm<00:04:18.139> really<00:04:18.380> curious<00:04:18.739> to<00:04:18.919> see<00:04:19.099> how<00:04:19.220> the

and i'm really curious to see how the

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.149 
and i'm really curious to see how the
fingerprint<00:04:20.060> detection<00:04:21.049> system<00:04:21.889> work<00:04:22.010> so

00:04:22.149 --> 00:04:22.159 
fingerprint detection system work so

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:23.560 
fingerprint detection system work so
probably<00:04:22.250> you<00:04:22.490> can<00:04:22.610> hold<00:04:22.820> it<00:04:22.940> like<00:04:23.060> this<00:04:23.120> keep
