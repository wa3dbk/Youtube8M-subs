over<00:01:43.270> here<00:01:43.360> and<00:01:43.390> says<00:01:43.540> hey<00:01:43.720> look<00:01:44.140> at<00:01:44.230> there<00:01:44.380> is

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
over here and says hey look at there is

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.020 
over here and says hey look at there is
dinner<00:01:44.770> and<00:01:44.920> he<00:01:44.980> sticks<00:01:45.220> his<00:01:45.310> nose<00:01:45.610> up<00:01:45.670> there

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
dinner and he sticks his nose up there

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.190 
dinner and he sticks his nose up there
he's<00:01:46.180> gonna<00:01:46.300> get<00:01:46.510> he's<00:01:46.810> gonna<00:01:47.020> get

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
he's gonna get he's gonna get

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.140 
he's gonna get he's gonna get
electrified<00:01:47.590> now<00:01:48.159> I<00:01:48.400> see<00:01:48.670> that<00:01:48.700> there's<00:01:49.060> a

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
electrified now I see that there's a

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.430 
electrified now I see that there's a
stake<00:01:49.390> on<00:01:49.570> each<00:01:49.690> one<00:01:49.810> of<00:01:49.870> those<00:01:49.960> your<00:01:50.140> stick<00:01:50.350> in

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
stake on each one of those your stick in

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.440 
stake on each one of those your stick in
the<00:01:50.530> ground<00:01:50.580> unroll<00:01:51.580> it<00:01:51.610> wherever<00:01:52.090> you<00:01:52.300> want

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
the ground unroll it wherever you want

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.780 
the ground unroll it wherever you want
that<00:01:52.510> to<00:01:52.720> be<00:01:52.840> yeah<00:01:53.110> so<00:01:53.530> if<00:01:53.590> you<00:01:53.650> want<00:01:53.890> to<00:01:53.979> switch

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
that to be yeah so if you want to switch

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.460 
that to be yeah so if you want to switch
from<00:01:55.000> one<00:01:55.180> area<00:01:55.479> to<00:01:55.600> the<00:01:55.720> next<00:01:55.810> and<00:01:56.200> just<00:01:56.229> kind

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
from one area to the next and just kind

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.340 
from one area to the next and just kind
of<00:01:56.500> move<00:01:56.680> along<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:58.180> that<00:01:58.570> next<00:01:58.780> fresh<00:01:59.080> grass

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
of move along to that next fresh grass

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.860 
of move along to that next fresh grass
scenario<00:01:59.979> there<00:02:00.580> you<00:02:00.700> are<00:02:00.850> there's<00:02:01.150> 13<00:02:01.570> step

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 
scenario there you are there's 13 step

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.080 
scenario there you are there's 13 step
in<00:02:02.049> post<00:02:02.290> catcher<00:02:03.010> so<00:02:03.430> you<00:02:03.490> can<00:02:03.790> see<00:02:03.970> in<00:02:04.030> a

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
in post catcher so you can see in a

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.340 
in post catcher so you can see in a
little<00:02:04.299> while<00:02:04.420> we'll<00:02:04.600> just<00:02:04.810> kind<00:02:05.020> of<00:02:05.110> throw

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
little while we'll just kind of throw

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.200 
little while we'll just kind of throw
them<00:02:05.470> out<00:02:05.650> as<00:02:05.830> we<00:02:06.010> go<00:02:06.130> along<00:02:06.159> and<00:02:06.820> then<00:02:06.940> walk

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
them out as we go along and then walk

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.969 
them out as we go along and then walk
back<00:02:07.240> around<00:02:07.600> stand<00:02:08.140> it<00:02:08.259> up<00:02:08.379> and<00:02:08.470> step<00:02:08.709> it<00:02:08.830> in

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
back around stand it up and step it in

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.559 
back around stand it up and step it in
all<00:02:09.519> right<00:02:09.549> I'm<00:02:09.759> looking<00:02:09.849> at<00:02:10.060> this<00:02:10.149> little<00:02:10.420> rig

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
all right I'm looking at this little rig

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.080 
all right I'm looking at this little rig
right<00:02:10.750> here<00:02:10.989> yeah<00:02:11.140> portable<00:02:11.890> or<00:02:12.010> dolly<00:02:12.280> tell

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
right here yeah portable or dolly tell

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.420 
right here yeah portable or dolly tell
us<00:02:13.180> how<00:02:13.330> it<00:02:13.420> works<00:02:13.600> okay<00:02:14.410> so<00:02:14.470> whenever<00:02:15.100> you

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
us how it works okay so whenever you

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.500 
us how it works okay so whenever you
pick<00:02:15.880> your

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
pick your

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.119 
pick your
and<00:02:16.780> you're<00:02:16.900> going<00:02:16.989> to<00:02:17.110> want<00:02:17.290> to<00:02:17.349> choose<00:02:18.069> a

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
and you're going to want to choose a

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.520 
and you're going to want to choose a
solar<00:02:18.430> energizer<00:02:18.909> that<00:02:19.629> matches<00:02:20.050> your<00:02:20.230> fence

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
solar energizer that matches your fence

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.530 
solar energizer that matches your fence
and<00:02:20.890> our<00:02:21.250> general<00:02:21.610> recommendation<00:02:22.360> is<00:02:22.510> that

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
and our general recommendation is that

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.930 
and our general recommendation is that
you<00:02:22.810> want<00:02:23.019> to<00:02:23.049> have<00:02:23.200> a<00:02:23.230> quarter<00:02:23.709> Joel<00:02:24.129> from

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
you want to have a quarter Joel from

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.660 
you want to have a quarter Joel from
your<00:02:25.090> energizer<00:02:25.480> output<00:02:26.019> per<00:02:26.890> electric<00:02:27.489> net

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
your energizer output per electric net

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.180 
your energizer output per electric net
and<00:02:27.940> then<00:02:28.420> this<00:02:28.569> little<00:02:28.810> component<00:02:29.230> here<00:02:29.620> is<00:02:29.680> a

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
and then this little component here is a

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.789 
and then this little component here is a
solar<00:02:30.670> charge<00:02:31.030> controller<00:02:31.510> and<00:02:31.810> I<00:02:32.260> always<00:02:32.530> say

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
solar charge controller and I always say

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.830 
solar charge controller and I always say
it's<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.040> brains<00:02:33.340> of<00:02:33.549> the<00:02:33.700> operation<00:02:33.840> it

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
it's the brains of the operation it

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.720 
it's the brains of the operation it
basically<00:02:35.410> controls<00:02:35.830> the<00:02:35.920> energy<00:02:36.099> going<00:02:36.459> into

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
basically controls the energy going into

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.789 
basically controls the energy going into
the<00:02:36.940> battery<00:02:37.269> and<00:02:37.569> then<00:02:38.049> RD<00:02:38.319> leaving<00:02:38.680> the

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
the battery and then RD leaving the

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:40.320 
the battery and then RD leaving the
battery<00:02:39.099> and<00:02:39.250> has<00:02:39.430> a<00:02:39.459> low<00:02:39.730> voltage<00:02:39.910> disconnect

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
battery and has a low voltage disconnect

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.500 
battery and has a low voltage disconnect
so<00:02:41.110> that<00:02:41.319> if<00:02:41.470> you<00:02:42.190> would<00:02:42.310> run<00:02:42.459> across<00:02:42.610> maybe<00:02:43.150> a

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
so that if you would run across maybe a

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.559 
so that if you would run across maybe a
period<00:02:44.230> that<00:02:44.709> you<00:02:44.860> don't<00:02:45.069> have<00:02:45.250> any<00:02:45.610> Sun<00:02:46.000> your

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
period that you don't have any Sun your

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.000 
period that you don't have any Sun your
battery<00:02:46.930> doesn't<00:02:47.290> totally<00:02:47.379> dissipate<00:02:47.890> and

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
battery doesn't totally dissipate and

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.569 
battery doesn't totally dissipate and
kill<00:02:48.159> itself

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
kill itself

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.250 
kill itself
you<00:02:49.000> set<00:02:49.209> the<00:02:49.329> stuff<00:02:49.540> out<00:02:49.690> and<00:02:49.810> it<00:02:49.900> just<00:02:49.930> rolls

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
you set the stuff out and it just rolls

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.930 
you set the stuff out and it just rolls
how<00:02:50.470> long<00:02:50.709> how<00:02:51.069> long<00:02:51.099> do<00:02:51.370> it<00:02:51.459> before<00:02:51.819> you<00:02:51.879> have

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
how long how long do it before you have

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.420 
how long how long do it before you have
to<00:02:52.060> replace<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.450> battery<00:02:52.780> or<00:02:53.129> as<00:02:54.129> long<00:02:54.220> as<00:02:54.280> you

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
to replace the battery or as long as you

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.860 
to replace the battery or as long as you
don't<00:02:54.730> as<00:02:54.970> long<00:02:55.120> as<00:02:55.239> you<00:02:55.329> have<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.660> solar

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
don't as long as you have the solar

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.660 
don't as long as you have the solar
controller<00:02:56.260> that<00:02:56.530> doesn't<00:02:56.920> let<00:02:57.040> it<00:02:57.069> totally

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
controller that doesn't let it totally

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.819 
controller that doesn't let it totally
dissipate<00:02:58.180> over<00:02:58.569> and<00:02:58.720> over<00:02:58.930> again<00:02:59.049> you'll<00:02:59.709> get

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
dissipate over and over again you'll get

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:01.410 
dissipate over and over again you'll get
a<00:02:59.890> long<00:03:00.160> period<00:03:00.640> of<00:03:00.700> time<00:03:00.910> out<00:03:01.120> of<00:03:01.239> that

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
a long period of time out of that

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.890 
a long period of time out of that
