00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:25.700 
see this claw is like I'm rotating

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.230 
see this claw is like I'm rotating
these<00:00:26.210> are<00:00:26.330> very<00:00:26.540> different<00:00:28.000> won't<00:00:29.000> find

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
these are very different won't find

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.320 
these are very different won't find
these<00:00:29.390> in<00:00:29.540> a<00:00:29.570> lot<00:00:29.750> of<00:00:29.840> places<00:00:30.080> but<00:00:30.500> I<00:00:31.119> have<00:00:32.119> one

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:32.330 
these in a lot of places but I have one

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.290 
these in a lot of places but I have one
here<00:00:32.540> and<00:00:32.780> these<00:00:33.470> are<00:00:33.530> extra<00:00:34.040> hard<00:00:34.280> because<00:00:34.340> as

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
here and these are extra hard because as

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.890 
here and these are extra hard because as
you<00:00:35.420> can<00:00:35.570> see<00:00:37.210> they<00:00:38.210> only<00:00:38.239> lets<00:00:38.600> you<00:00:38.720> go

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:38.900 
you can see they only lets you go

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.830 
you can see they only lets you go
forward<00:00:39.260> and<00:00:39.440> back<00:00:39.739> and<00:00:40.100> the<00:00:40.820> timer<00:00:41.180> on<00:00:41.510> these

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
forward and back and the timer on these

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.049 
forward and back and the timer on these
are<00:00:42.170> very<00:00:42.199> quick<00:00:42.710> it's<00:00:42.890> like<00:00:43.070> 15<00:00:43.489> seconds<00:00:43.970> and

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
are very quick it's like 15 seconds and

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.750 
are very quick it's like 15 seconds and
it<00:00:44.120> goes<00:00:44.300> quick<00:00:44.629> so<00:00:44.930> you<00:00:45.290> have<00:00:46.190> to<00:00:46.460> actually

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
it goes quick so you have to actually

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.210 
it goes quick so you have to actually
know<00:00:47.629> what<00:00:47.840> you<00:00:47.960> want<00:00:48.140> to<00:00:48.199> go<00:00:48.320> for<00:00:48.590> beforehand

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 
know what you want to go for beforehand

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.280 
know what you want to go for beforehand
and<00:00:49.550> then<00:00:50.300> plant<00:00:50.720> it<00:00:50.840> then<00:00:50.960> you<00:00:51.020> got<00:00:51.140> to<00:00:51.260> put

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
and then plant it then you got to put

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.009 
and then plant it then you got to put
your<00:00:51.530> quarter<00:00:51.920> in<00:00:52.100> the<00:00:52.220> right<00:00:52.430> one<00:00:52.900> you<00:00:53.900> just

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:54.019 
your quarter in the right one you just

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:55.570 
your quarter in the right one you just
got<00:00:54.140> there<00:00:54.290> so<00:00:54.470> it's<00:00:54.620> all<00:00:54.739> about<00:00:54.920> timing<00:00:55.280> the

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:55.580 
got there so it's all about timing the

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.270 
got there so it's all about timing the
one<00:00:55.730> that<00:00:56.150> Spencer<00:00:56.660> says<00:00:56.930> it's<00:00:57.280> extra

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
one that Spencer says it's extra

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.480 
one that Spencer says it's extra
difficult<00:00:58.780> let's<00:00:59.780> see<00:00:59.930> if<00:01:00.019> we

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:02.490 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.310 

you<00:01:03.000> know<00:01:03.090> these<00:01:03.210> Metz<00:01:03.510> guys<00:01:03.810> right<00:01:04.140> here

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
you know these Metz guys right here

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.050 
you know these Metz guys right here
aren't<00:01:04.620> very<00:01:04.860> surrounded<00:01:05.460> by<00:01:05.580> anything<00:01:05.880> so

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
aren't very surrounded by anything so

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.910 
aren't very surrounded by anything so
they<00:01:06.150> should<00:01:06.330> be<00:01:06.360> pretty<00:01:06.510> easy<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:07.080> guess

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
they should be pretty easy to guess

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.760 
they should be pretty easy to guess

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
make sure you look to the side this is

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.560 
make sure you look to the side this is
one<00:01:28.649> of<00:01:28.740> this<00:01:28.830> cluster<00:01:29.450> mechanism<00:01:30.450> the

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
all timing here it's extra difficult

00:01:51.390 --> 00:02:00.070 
all timing here it's extra difficult
because<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.960> spins

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:10.900 

and<00:02:00.380> time<00:02:00.710> it<00:02:00.860> perfectly<00:02:09.369> good<00:02:10.369> you<00:02:10.520> have<00:02:10.729> this

prize<00:02:11.380> always<00:02:12.380> going<00:02:12.530> to<00:02:12.590> drop<00:02:12.740> it<00:02:12.920> because

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
prize always going to drop it because

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.420 
prize always going to drop it because
the<00:02:13.280> computer<00:02:13.760> inside<00:02:14.030> tells<00:02:14.390> it<00:02:14.630> to<00:02:15.430> tell

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
the computer inside tells it to tell

actual<00:02:18.830> hard<00:02:18.980> to<00:02:19.100> get<00:02:19.250> because<00:02:19.610> there's

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
actual hard to get because there's

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.970 
actual hard to get because there's
nothing<00:02:19.940> really<00:02:20.240> to<00:02:20.360> hook<00:02:20.630> on<00:02:20.810> to<00:02:20.980> there

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
nothing really to hook on to there

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.920 
nothing really to hook on to there
they're<00:02:22.610> like<00:02:22.790> real<00:02:23.000> big<00:02:23.180> and<00:02:23.420> round<00:02:23.630> and

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
they're like real big and round and

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.660 
they're like real big and round and
there's<00:02:24.080> nothing<00:02:24.440> for<00:02:24.620> really<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:25.040> clocks<00:02:25.310> of

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
there's nothing for really the clocks of

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.880 
there's nothing for really the clocks of
grab<00:02:26.150> they're<00:02:26.870> gonna<00:02:26.960> slip<00:02:27.290> out<00:02:27.440> ever<00:02:27.680> more

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
grab they're gonna slip out ever more

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.380 
grab they're gonna slip out ever more
unlikely<00:02:28.190> every<00:02:28.550> time<00:02:28.730> so<00:02:28.970> I<00:02:29.030> would<00:02:29.210> not

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
unlikely every time so I would not

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.970 
unlikely every time so I would not
recommend<00:02:29.570> going<00:02:29.990> for<00:02:30.080> prizes<00:02:30.440> like<00:02:30.740> that

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
recommend going for prizes like that

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.040 
recommend going for prizes like that
especially<00:02:31.430> because<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.390> claw<00:02:32.630> is<00:02:32.840> that

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
especially because the claw is that

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.780 
especially because the claw is that
small<00:02:33.410> but<00:02:34.100> it's<00:02:34.430> gonna<00:02:34.550> be<00:02:34.700> almost

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
small but it's gonna be almost

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.870 
small but it's gonna be almost
impossible<00:02:34.940> to<00:02:35.510> get<00:02:35.600> a<00:02:35.660> big<00:02:35.840> round<00:02:36.080> prize<00:02:36.470> like

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
impossible to get a big round prize like

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.010 
impossible to get a big round prize like
we're<00:02:37.880> gonna<00:02:37.970> try<00:02:38.060> for<00:02:38.240> another<00:02:38.420> met<00:02:38.750> sky

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
we're gonna try for another met sky

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.590 
we're gonna try for another met sky
again<00:02:39.350> because<00:02:40.030> they<00:02:41.030> seem<00:02:41.300> to<00:02:41.330> be<00:02:41.570> the

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
again because they seem to be the

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.920 
again because they seem to be the
easiest<00:02:41.750> but<00:02:42.470> on<00:02:42.740> that<00:02:43.330> it's<00:02:44.330> claw<00:02:44.600> doesn't

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
easiest but on that it's claw doesn't

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:52.360 
easiest but on that it's claw doesn't
like<00:02:45.020> grab<00:02:45.320> for<00:02:45.560> me

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:58.670 

there<00:02:53.370> we<00:02:53.489> go<00:02:53.610> that's<00:02:53.670> got<00:02:54.030> him<00:02:57.319> and<00:02:58.319> again<00:02:58.560> you

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
there we go that's got him and again you

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.350 
there we go that's got him and again you
know<00:02:58.800> especially<00:02:59.459> on<00:02:59.550> machines<00:02:59.879> like<00:03:00.090> this

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
know especially on machines like this

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.050 
know especially on machines like this
there<00:03:01.110> might<00:03:01.290> be<00:03:01.319> some<00:03:01.830> sides<00:03:02.220> of<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.730> machine

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
there might be some sides of the machine

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.880 
there might be some sides of the machine
that<00:03:03.510> are<00:03:03.690> actually<00:03:04.140> have<00:03:04.230> a<00:03:04.290> stronger<00:03:04.680> grip

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
that are actually have a stronger grip

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.530 
that are actually have a stronger grip
like<00:03:05.160> for<00:03:05.370> sale<00:03:06.200> so<00:03:07.550> it's<00:03:08.550> always<00:03:08.700> good<00:03:08.940> to<00:03:09.000> try

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
a couple different positions so you can

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.009 
a couple different positions so you can
maybe<00:03:11.819> get<00:03:12.060> you<00:03:12.239> know<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.420> feel<00:03:12.660> of<00:03:12.690> which
