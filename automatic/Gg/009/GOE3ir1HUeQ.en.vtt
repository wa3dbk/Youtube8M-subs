solutions continuing on our series of

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.340 
solutions continuing on our series of
questions<00:00:15.150> that<00:00:15.509> students<00:00:15.870> have<00:00:16.020> sent<00:00:16.230> in

over the last couple of months and one

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.990 
over the last couple of months and one
of<00:00:19.199> them<00:00:19.350> that<00:00:19.859> I'm<00:00:20.130> going<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.369> kind<00:00:20.550> of<00:00:20.640> adapt

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
of them that I'm going to kind of adapt

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.970 
of them that I'm going to kind of adapt
to<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.330> question<00:00:21.689> that<00:00:21.720> was<00:00:21.930> sent<00:00:22.140> in<00:00:22.260> but<00:00:22.619> it

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
to the question that was sent in but it

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.920 
to the question that was sent in but it
basically<00:00:23.250> has<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:24.029> do<00:00:24.180> with<00:00:24.330> topping<00:00:24.810> the

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
basically has to do with topping the

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.310 
basically has to do with topping the
golf<00:00:25.140> ball<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.650> how<00:00:26.580> why<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:27.359> do<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:28.080> how

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
golf ball and how why you do it and how

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.550 
golf ball and how why you do it and how
you<00:00:28.380> can<00:00:28.890> prevent<00:00:29.099> doing<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.439> one<00:00:31.439> of

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
you can prevent doing that and one of

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.799 
you can prevent doing that and one of
the<00:00:31.650> things<00:00:31.949> when<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.340> see<00:00:32.640> students<00:00:33.120> or

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
the things when I see students or

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.979 
the things when I see students or
golfers<00:00:34.440> top<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:35.100> ball<00:00:35.280> or<00:00:35.989> more

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
golfers top the ball or more

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.160 
golfers top the ball or more
specifically<00:00:37.680> if<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.280> over<00:00:38.700> here<00:00:39.170> golfers

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
specifically if I over here golfers

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.500 
specifically if I over here golfers
talking<00:00:40.710> most<00:00:41.370> people<00:00:41.700> assume<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.390> because

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
talking most people assume that because

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.610 
talking most people assume that because
you<00:00:43.079> talk<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.590> ball<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:43.950> look<00:00:44.100> up<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:45.620> it

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
you talk the ball you look up and it

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.750 
you talk the ball you look up and it
could<00:00:47.190> be<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:48.059> in<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.860> small<00:00:49.860> aspect<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.610> it

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
could be that in a small aspect of it

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.209 
could be that in a small aspect of it
but<00:00:51.270> really<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.780> has<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.020> lot<00:00:52.350> more<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.800> do<00:00:53.010> with

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
but really it has a lot more to do with

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.000 
but really it has a lot more to do with
how<00:00:53.460> your<00:00:53.699> whole<00:00:54.030> body<00:00:54.480> moves<00:00:55.199> up<00:00:55.500> through<00:00:55.860> the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
how your whole body moves up through the

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.080 
how your whole body moves up through the
ball<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.550> if<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:58.079> watch<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.250> golfer<00:00:59.820> hit<00:01:00.059> a

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
ball and if you watch a golfer hit a

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.740 
ball and if you watch a golfer hit a
real<00:01:00.480> crisp<00:01:00.989> clean<00:01:01.680> shot<00:01:02.070> as<00:01:02.370> they<00:01:03.270> swing

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
real crisp clean shot as they swing

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.230 
real crisp clean shot as they swing
through<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.260> ball<00:01:04.470> as<00:01:05.070> they<00:01:05.640> get<00:01:05.790> their<00:01:05.970> body

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
through the ball as they get their body

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.030 
through the ball as they get their body
in<00:01:06.479> motion<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:07.200> swing<00:01:07.530> through<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.890> ball

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
in motion and swing through the ball

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.960 
in motion and swing through the ball
they<00:01:08.909> stayed<00:01:09.360> down<00:01:09.900> through<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.439> ball<00:01:10.970> let

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
they stayed down through the ball let

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.660 
they stayed down through the ball let
their<00:01:12.180> club<00:01:12.450> extend<00:01:12.990> right<00:01:13.170> at<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.830> ball<00:01:14.040> for

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
their club extend right at the ball for

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.410 
their club extend right at the ball for
impact<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.390> then<00:01:16.009> rise<00:01:17.009> up<00:01:17.340> on<00:01:17.670> their<00:01:18.180> follow

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
impact and then rise up on their follow

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.260 
impact and then rise up on their follow
through<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.430> so<00:01:20.430> that's<00:01:20.640> going<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.060> help

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
through and so that's going to help

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.780 
through and so that's going to help
produce<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.900> really<00:01:22.229> crisp<00:01:22.590> clean<00:01:23.100> golf<00:01:23.549> shot

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
produce a really crisp clean golf shot

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.660 
produce a really crisp clean golf shot
if<00:01:24.060> you're<00:01:24.960> constantly<00:01:25.350> topping<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.460> ball

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
if you're constantly topping the ball

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.039 
if you're constantly topping the ball
one<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.119> things<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.720> want<00:01:27.930> to

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
one of the things that you want to

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.600 
one of the things that you want to
consider<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.920> as<00:01:29.900> you<00:01:30.900> swing<00:01:31.259> as<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:32.369> take

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
consider is as you swing as you take

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.249 
consider is as you swing as you take
your<00:01:32.640> backswing<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.869> start<00:01:34.170> your

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
your backswing and you start your

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.069 
your backswing and you start your
downswing<00:01:34.710> do<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.579> feel<00:01:36.000> yourself<00:01:36.270> lifting

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
downswing do you feel yourself lifting

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.620 
downswing do you feel yourself lifting
up<00:01:37.229> so<00:01:37.409> it's<00:01:37.590> not<00:01:37.710> just<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.430> head<00:01:38.670> it's<00:01:39.329> your

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
up so it's not just the head it's your

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.560 
up so it's not just the head it's your
whole<00:01:39.990> body<00:01:40.500> getting<00:01:41.400> up<00:01:41.670> through<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.360> ball

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
whole body getting up through the ball

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.499 
whole body getting up through the ball
and<00:01:43.470> I<00:01:44.100> see<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.310> lot<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.579> students<00:01:45.000> struggle

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
and I see a lot of students struggle

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.080 
and I see a lot of students struggle
with<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.810> because<00:01:46.229> in<00:01:46.619> their<00:01:46.829> mind<00:01:47.159> they<00:01:47.850> want

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
with it because in their mind they want

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.999 
with it because in their mind they want
to<00:01:48.149> get<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.420> ball<00:01:48.659> in<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:48.960> air<00:01:49.079> so<00:01:49.439> they're<00:01:49.710> in

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
to get the ball in the air so they're in

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.999

in essence trying to assist the ball to

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.340 
in essence trying to assist the ball to
get<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.250> up<00:01:53.369> in<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.610> air<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.000> by<00:01:54.899> doing<00:01:55.200> that

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
their shoulders and their head are at

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.559 
their shoulders and their head are at
set<00:02:55.720> up<00:02:55.900> and<00:02:56.170> then<00:02:56.799> and<00:02:57.069> then<00:02:57.730> as<00:02:57.970> they<00:02:58.209> swing

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
set up and then and then as they swing

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.000 
set up and then and then as they swing
through<00:02:58.959> you<00:02:59.230> can<00:02:59.440> see<00:02:59.680> where<00:02:59.890> those

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
through you can see where those

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.890 
through you can see where those
shoulders<00:03:00.549> and<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:00.790> head<00:03:00.970> get<00:03:01.239> above<00:03:01.629> those

shoulders and the head get above those

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.899 
shoulders and the head get above those
lines<00:03:02.260> so<00:03:02.500> then<00:03:02.650> I<00:03:02.680> have<00:03:03.010> them<00:03:03.220> focus<00:03:03.459> on

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:03.909 
lines so then I have them focus on

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:08.309 
lines so then I have them focus on
maintaining<00:03:04.900> their<00:03:06.209> drive<00:03:07.209> thru<00:03:07.319> keeping

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
maintaining their drive thru keeping

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.880 
maintaining their drive thru keeping
everything<00:03:08.650> low<00:03:09.040> and<00:03:09.340> then<00:03:09.670> lifting<00:03:10.569> up<00:03:10.750> so<00:03:11.560> I

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
everything low and then lifting up so I

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.750 
everything low and then lifting up so I
hope<00:03:12.370> this<00:03:12.430> can<00:03:12.849> help<00:03:12.909> alleviate<00:03:13.900> some<00:03:14.409> of<00:03:14.440> the
