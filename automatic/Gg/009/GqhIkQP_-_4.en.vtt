a headpiece on them this one doesn't and

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.840 
a headpiece on them this one doesn't and
it's<00:01:55.290> what's<00:01:55.619> really<00:01:55.890> interesting<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.700> they

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
it's what's really interesting is they

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.740 
it's what's really interesting is they
flip<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.360> colors<00:01:58.520> orange<00:01:59.520> stripes<00:01:59.909> blue

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
flip the colors orange stripes blue

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.190 
flip the colors orange stripes blue
stripes<00:02:01.110> blue<00:02:01.770> body<00:02:01.979> orange<00:02:02.670> body<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.240> the

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
stripes blue body orange body and the

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.380 
stripes blue body orange body and the
colors<00:02:04.469> complement<00:02:05.009> each<00:02:05.100> other<00:02:05.340> well<00:02:05.430> so<00:02:06.360> I

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
colors complement each other well so I

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.320 
colors complement each other well so I
think<00:02:06.810> that's<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.290> good<00:02:07.409> combination<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.399> the

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
think that's a good combination and the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.760 
think that's a good combination and the
only<00:02:09.539> other<00:02:09.660> difference<00:02:09.869> I<00:02:10.229> can<00:02:10.410> really<00:02:10.560> see

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
only other difference I can really see

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.700 
only other difference I can really see
is<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.930> toenails<00:02:12.930> and

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
is the toenails and

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.840 
is the toenails and
my<00:02:13.800> claw<00:02:14.280> his<00:02:14.550> claws<00:02:15.360> are<00:02:16.170> like<00:02:16.520> white<00:02:17.520> in<00:02:17.700> this

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
my claw his claws are like white in this

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.600 
my claw his claws are like white in this
version<00:02:18.090> and<00:02:18.480> blue<00:02:18.660> in<00:02:18.810> this<00:02:18.930> one<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.610> they

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
version and blue in this one and they

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.860 
version and blue in this one and they
both<00:02:20.760> have<00:02:20.940> their<00:02:21.060> mouths<00:02:21.210> open<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:21.720> stuff

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
both have their mouths open and stuff

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.670 
both have their mouths open and stuff
like<00:02:22.020> that<00:02:23.900> alternative<00:02:24.900> version<00:02:25.350> would<00:02:25.620> be

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
like that alternative version would be

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.910 
like that alternative version would be
the<00:02:26.310> shiny<00:02:26.580> version<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.380> he's<00:02:28.380> shown<00:02:28.560> off<00:02:28.770> in

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
the shiny version and he's shown off in

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.620 
the shiny version and he's shown off in
another<00:02:29.070> video<00:02:29.430> so<00:02:30.030> I'm<00:02:30.150> going<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.420> go<00:02:30.540> ahead

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
another video so I'm going to go ahead

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.820 
another video so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:02:30.870> get<00:02:30.960> my<00:02:31.050> grandmom's<00:02:31.440> out<00:02:31.620> of<00:02:31.770> here

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
and get my grandmom's out of here

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.740 
and get my grandmom's out of here
another<00:02:34.830> Greymon<00:02:35.310> would<00:02:35.610> be<00:02:35.760> this<00:02:36.030> guy<00:02:36.270> and

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
another Greymon would be this guy and

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.160 
another Greymon would be this guy and
it's<00:02:37.440> ended<00:02:38.160> geogreymon<00:02:38.910> and<00:02:39.810> this<00:02:39.930> is<00:02:40.050> the

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
it's ended geogreymon and this is the

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.080 
it's ended geogreymon and this is the
small<00:02:40.500> version<00:02:40.530> that<00:02:41.310> transforms<00:02:41.790> into<00:02:41.940> an

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
small version that transforms into an

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.030 
small version that transforms into an
egg<00:02:42.270> come<00:02:42.480> on<00:02:42.630> but<00:02:43.320> I<00:02:43.350> thought<00:02:43.620> I'd<00:02:43.800> show<00:02:43.950> him

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
egg come on but I thought I'd show him

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.860 
egg come on but I thought I'd show him
off<00:02:44.220> anyway<00:02:44.580> is<00:02:44.790> there<00:02:44.970> just<00:02:45.330> so<00:02:45.480> many<00:02:45.660> graham

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
off anyway is there just so many graham

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.770 
off anyway is there just so many graham
on<00:02:46.050> figures<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:46.770> then<00:02:47.460> there's<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.850> geo

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
on figures and then there's the geo

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.600 
on figures and then there's the geo
grave<00:02:49.050> on<00:02:49.230> that<00:02:49.440> turns<00:02:49.620> into<00:02:49.770> rise<00:02:50.010> Greymon

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
grave on that turns into rise Greymon

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.080 
grave on that turns into rise Greymon
and<00:02:50.910> these<00:02:51.660> two<00:02:51.900> are<00:02:52.110> very<00:02:52.140> similar<00:02:52.880> but<00:02:53.880> this

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
and these two are very similar but this

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.110 
and these two are very similar but this
guy<00:02:54.270> has<00:02:54.510> stripes<00:02:54.870> on<00:02:55.110> his<00:02:55.260> head<00:02:55.590> and<00:02:56.120> risk

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
guy has stripes on his head and risk

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.540 
guy has stripes on his head and risk
things<00:02:57.600> which<00:02:58.410> is<00:02:58.650> different<00:02:59.070> because<00:02:59.250> none

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
things which is different because none

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.460 
things which is different because none
of<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.670> other<00:02:59.790> green<00:03:00.000> ones<00:03:00.180> have<00:03:00.390> that<00:03:00.660> and<00:03:00.960> he

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
of the other green ones have that and he

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.800 
of the other green ones have that and he
turns<00:03:01.710> into<00:03:01.920> rise<00:03:02.190> Greymon<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:03.300> like<00:03:03.690> the

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
turns into rise Greymon and like the

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.410 
turns into rise Greymon and like the
other<00:03:03.960> gray<00:03:04.110> mountains<00:03:04.440> his<00:03:04.620> mouth<00:03:04.830> opens<00:03:05.420> but

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
other gray mountains his mouth opens but

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.110 
other gray mountains his mouth opens but
not<00:03:06.570> very<00:03:06.750> well

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
not very well

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.240 
not very well
so<00:03:09.120> enough<00:03:09.540> of<00:03:09.660> a<00:03:09.720> random<00:03:10.020> grand<00:03:10.230> anse<00:03:10.410> let's

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
so enough of a random grand anse let's

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.630 
so enough of a random grand anse let's
move<00:03:11.460> on<00:03:11.610> to<00:03:11.760> this<00:03:12.330> one<00:03:13.160> he's<00:03:14.160> pretty<00:03:14.430> flexible

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
move on to this one he's pretty flexible

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.510 
move on to this one he's pretty flexible
he<00:03:15.270> can<00:03:15.450> do<00:03:15.900> lots<00:03:16.230> of<00:03:16.350> stuff<00:03:16.410> okay<00:03:17.310> not<00:03:17.490> really

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
he can do lots of stuff okay not really

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.270 
he can do lots of stuff okay not really
he's<00:03:18.390> a<00:03:18.420> pretty<00:03:18.660> basic<00:03:18.900> figure<00:03:19.500> he<00:03:20.010> doesn't

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
he's a pretty basic figure he doesn't

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.820 
he's a pretty basic figure he doesn't
really<00:03:20.400> do<00:03:20.820> that<00:03:20.850> much<00:03:21.180> and<00:03:21.690> he<00:03:22.650> doesn't

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
really do that much and he doesn't

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.040 
really do that much and he doesn't
really<00:03:23.190> combine<00:03:23.520> that's<00:03:24.240> the<00:03:24.450> only<00:03:24.660> Greymon

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
really combine that's the only Greymon

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.080 
really combine that's the only Greymon
figure<00:03:25.440> they<00:03:25.920> came<00:03:26.130> with<00:03:26.340> it<00:03:26.490> other<00:03:26.730> than<00:03:26.970> the

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
figure they came with it other than the

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.170 
figure they came with it other than the
did<00:03:27.240> you<00:03:27.270> memory<00:03:27.720> so<00:03:28.530> he's<00:03:28.890> kind<00:03:29.130> of<00:03:29.250> alone<00:03:29.940> in

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
did you memory so he's kind of alone in

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.540 
did you memory so he's kind of alone in
that<00:03:30.270> respect<00:03:30.720> he's<00:03:31.470> just<00:03:32.120> there<00:03:34.190> he<00:03:35.190> composed

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
that respect he's just there he composed

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.690 
that respect he's just there he composed
pretty<00:03:35.880> well<00:03:36.060> I<00:03:36.090> suppose<00:03:36.510> his<00:03:36.780> tail<00:03:37.050> bends

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
pretty well I suppose his tail bends

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.040 
pretty well I suppose his tail bends
mostly<00:03:38.700> so<00:03:39.000> you<00:03:39.090> can<00:03:39.210> combine<00:03:39.390> with<00:03:39.570> male<00:03:39.840> bird

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
mostly so you can combine with male bird

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.410 
mostly so you can combine with male bird
Ramon<00:03:40.440> so<00:03:40.620> you<00:03:40.710> can<00:03:40.830> go<00:03:40.980> up<00:03:41.090> they<00:03:42.090> can't<00:03:42.300> really

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
Ramon so you can go up they can't really

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.350 
Ramon so you can go up they can't really
go<00:03:42.600> down<00:03:42.810> very<00:03:43.050> well<00:03:43.350> but<00:03:43.800> it<00:03:44.010> can<00:03:44.160> go<00:03:44.310> up<00:03:44.460> so

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
go down very well but it can go up so

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.910 
go down very well but it can go up so
you<00:03:45.480> mostly<00:03:45.720> just<00:03:45.840> leave<00:03:46.140> it<00:03:46.290> like<00:03:46.320> that<00:03:46.440> it

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
you mostly just leave it like that it

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.490 
you mostly just leave it like that it
has<00:03:47.070> that<00:03:47.280> tip<00:03:47.670> at<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.030> end<00:03:48.240> which<00:03:49.170> I<00:03:49.290> suppose

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
has that tip at the end which I suppose

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.320 
has that tip at the end which I suppose
he<00:03:49.680> smashes<00:03:50.130> into<00:03:50.310> enemies<00:03:50.670> every<00:03:50.910> once<00:03:51.090> in<00:03:51.240> a

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
he smashes into enemies every once in a

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.290 
he smashes into enemies every once in a
while<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:51.870> his<00:03:52.710> mouth<00:03:52.890> opens<00:03:53.430> these<00:03:54.060> things

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
while and his mouth opens these things

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.550 
while and his mouth opens these things
are<00:03:54.450> made<00:03:54.570> of<00:03:54.600> rubber<00:03:54.840> so<00:03:55.200> you<00:03:55.290> need<00:03:55.440> to<00:03:55.500> be

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
are made of rubber so you need to be

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.690 
are made of rubber so you need to be
careful<00:03:55.980> about<00:03:56.040> them<00:03:57.590> and<00:03:58.590> his<00:03:58.770> mouth<00:03:59.010> will

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
careful about them and his mouth will

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.230 
careful about them and his mouth will
open<00:04:00.270> if<00:04:00.870> you're<00:04:01.110> really<00:04:01.650> careful<00:04:02.240> like

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
open if you're really careful like

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.610 
open if you're really careful like
that's<00:04:04.670> showing<00:04:05.670> off<00:04:05.790> his<00:04:05.940> teeth<00:04:06.210> and<00:04:06.620> his

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
that's showing off his teeth and his

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.540 
that's showing off his teeth and his
tongue<00:04:08.340> thing<00:04:09.440> I'm<00:04:10.440> not<00:04:10.620> really<00:04:10.800> 100%<00:04:10.950> sure

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
tongue thing I'm not really 100% sure

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.940 
tongue thing I'm not really 100% sure
about<00:04:11.780> it<00:04:12.780> anyway<00:04:13.050> he<00:04:13.230> looks<00:04:13.410> slightly<00:04:13.680> better

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
about it anyway he looks slightly better

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.310 
about it anyway he looks slightly better
with<00:04:14.130> his<00:04:14.250> mouth<00:04:14.460> open<00:04:14.790> and<00:04:15.540> her<00:04:15.690> shut<00:04:16.080> I

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
with his mouth open and her shut I

anyway that's what the arms do that's

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.070 
anyway that's what the arms do that's
what<00:04:52.710> the<00:04:52.770> tail<00:04:52.979> does<00:04:53.219> the<00:04:53.819> head<00:04:54.060> can<00:04:54.419> go<00:04:54.449> up<00:04:54.780> a

what the tail does the head can go up a
little<00:04:55.409> bit<00:04:55.759> down<00:04:56.759> a<00:04:56.789> little<00:04:57.180> bit<00:04:57.680> but<00:04:58.680> mostly

00:04:58.939 --> 00:04:58.949 
little bit down a little bit but mostly

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:01.790 
little bit down a little bit but mostly
stays<00:04:59.250> like<00:04:59.460> this<00:04:59.870> his<00:05:00.870> posture<00:05:01.379> is<00:05:01.409> different

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
stays like this his posture is different

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.230 
stays like this his posture is different
from<00:05:01.889> the<00:05:02.099> other<00:05:02.219> grandmom's<00:05:02.669> in<00:05:02.879> the<00:05:03.000> sense

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
from the other grandmom's in the sense

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.200 
from the other grandmom's in the sense
that<00:05:03.360> he's<00:05:03.659> like<00:05:04.099> kind<00:05:05.099> of<00:05:05.219> flat<00:05:05.550> his<00:05:05.849> body<00:05:06.060> is

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
that he's like kind of flat his body is

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.640 
that he's like kind of flat his body is
parallel<00:05:06.810> with<00:05:07.020> the<00:05:07.139> ground

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
parallel with the ground

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.969 
parallel with the ground
his<00:05:08.189> legs<00:05:08.520> they<00:05:08.939> can<00:05:09.120> go<00:05:09.270> out<00:05:09.800> but<00:05:10.800> that's

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 
his legs they can go out but that's

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:11.420 
his legs they can go out but that's
about<00:05:11.159> it

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
about it

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.179 
about it
they<00:05:11.789> don't<00:05:11.969> his<00:05:12.389> ankles<00:05:12.990> don't<00:05:13.110> just<00:05:13.469> so

00:05:14.179 --> 00:05:14.189 
they don't his ankles don't just so

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:15.350 
they don't his ankles don't just so
having<00:05:14.370> him<00:05:14.550> like<00:05:14.699> that<00:05:14.909> is<00:05:15.029> pretty<00:05:15.180> much

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
having him like that is pretty much

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.920 
having him like that is pretty much
pointless<00:05:16.939> also<00:05:17.939> his<00:05:18.120> legs<00:05:18.330> been<00:05:18.629> in<00:05:18.900> a

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
pointless also his legs been in a

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.140 
pointless also his legs been in a
variety<00:05:19.139> of<00:05:19.319> ways<00:05:19.469> his<00:05:19.800> ankles<00:05:20.250> go<00:05:20.610> forward

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
variety of ways his ankles go forward

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.670 
variety of ways his ankles go forward
and<00:05:21.270> back<00:05:21.889> okay<00:05:22.889> not<00:05:23.099> very<00:05:23.129> well<00:05:23.550> though<00:05:24.680> like

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
and back okay not very well though like

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.159 
and back okay not very well though like
they<00:05:26.159> give<00:05:26.340> you<00:05:26.460> some<00:05:26.879> flexibility<00:05:27.569> with<00:05:27.599> legs

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:28.169 
they give you some flexibility with legs

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:31.119 
they give you some flexibility with legs
but<00:05:28.770> it's<00:05:28.949> really<00:05:29.129> not<00:05:29.340> going<00:05:29.430> to<00:05:29.490> go<00:05:29.669> very<00:05:29.879> far

00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:31.129 
but it's really not going to go very far

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:33.320 
but it's really not going to go very far
so<00:05:32.129> it's<00:05:32.279> kind<00:05:32.430> of<00:05:32.460> best<00:05:32.699> to<00:05:32.819> just<00:05:32.940> keep<00:05:33.180> him

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
so it's kind of best to just keep him

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.950 
so it's kind of best to just keep him
like<00:05:33.509> this

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
like this

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.769 
like this
I<00:05:33.990> mean<00:05:34.259> you<00:05:34.349> could<00:05:34.500> bend<00:05:34.889> his<00:05:35.009> legs<00:05:35.219> like<00:05:35.400> that

00:05:35.769 --> 00:05:35.779 
I mean you could bend his legs like that

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:39.170 
I mean you could bend his legs like that
but<00:05:36.779> his<00:05:37.080> legs<00:05:37.349> are<00:05:37.620> just<00:05:37.940> awkward<00:05:38.940> in<00:05:39.029> that

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
but his legs are just awkward in that

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.809 
but his legs are just awkward in that
sense<00:05:39.509> he<00:05:40.409> has<00:05:40.500> this<00:05:40.650> thing<00:05:40.860> on<00:05:40.979> his<00:05:41.129> back<00:05:41.159> but

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:41.819 
sense he has this thing on his back but

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:43.909 
sense he has this thing on his back but
that's<00:05:42.000> for<00:05:42.210> transformation<00:05:42.839> purposes<00:05:43.379> and

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 
that's for transformation purposes and

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:45.409 
that's for transformation purposes and
he<00:05:44.279> looks<00:05:44.460> about<00:05:44.580> the<00:05:44.819> same<00:05:45.029> all<00:05:45.240> the<00:05:45.270> way

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:45.419 
he looks about the same all the way

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:45.890 
he looks about the same all the way
around

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
around

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.290 
around
except<00:05:46.469> he<00:05:46.560> has<00:05:46.650> screws<00:05:46.949> on<00:05:47.129> this<00:05:47.310> side<00:05:47.520> and<00:05:48.150> it

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
except he has screws on this side and it

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.420 
except he has screws on this side and it
says<00:05:48.479> Made<00:05:48.750> in<00:05:48.779> China<00:05:48.960> it's<00:05:49.860> a<00:05:49.949> Japanese

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
says Made in China it's a Japanese

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.920 
says Made in China it's a Japanese
version<00:05:50.699> that's<00:05:51.180> made<00:05:51.389> in<00:05:51.539> China

version that's made in China

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.749 
version that's made in China
so<00:05:52.169> everything<00:05:52.800> in<00:05:53.039> America<00:05:53.400> is<00:05:53.460> made<00:05:53.669> in

everything in Japan is also made in
China
