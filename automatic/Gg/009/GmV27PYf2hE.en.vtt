00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
then on the other side I have small red

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.569 
then on the other side I have small red
ones<00:01:53.820> on<00:01:54.000> front<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.540> great<00:01:55.200> big<00:01:55.560> green<00:01:56.250> ones

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
ones on front and great big green ones

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.910 
ones on front and great big green ones
on<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.210> back<00:01:57.649> let's<00:01:58.649> look<00:01:58.770> at<00:01:58.860> the

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
on the back let's look at the

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.770 
on the back let's look at the
differences<00:01:59.399> between<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.790> trio<00:02:00.060> 30<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.689> the

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
differences between the trio 30 and the

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.469 
differences between the trio 30 and the
trio<00:02:01.049> 40<00:02:01.530> it's<00:02:01.680> really<00:02:01.920> quite<00:02:02.159> simple<00:02:02.460> this<00:02:02.729> 40

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
trio 40 it's really quite simple this 40

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.139 
trio 40 it's really quite simple this 40
is<00:02:03.659> bigger<00:02:03.930> than<00:02:04.200> this<00:02:04.439> 30<00:02:04.799> makes<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.759> lot<00:02:06.119> of

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
is bigger than this 30 makes a lot of

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.940 
is bigger than this 30 makes a lot of
difference<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.899> plants<00:02:07.290> however<00:02:07.619> because

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
difference to the plants however because

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.710 
difference to the plants however because
if<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.399> take<00:02:08.579> a<00:02:08.640> look<00:02:08.820> at<00:02:08.940> these<00:02:09.119> tomatoes

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
if you take a look at these tomatoes

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.750 
if you take a look at these tomatoes
that<00:02:09.869> are<00:02:09.929> in<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.259> center<00:02:10.500> these<00:02:11.250> are<00:02:11.519> both

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
that are in the center these are both

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.600 
that are in the center these are both
the<00:02:12.030> husky<00:02:12.360> cherry<00:02:12.629> red<00:02:12.900> I<00:02:13.260> planted<00:02:14.160> them<00:02:14.340> from

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
the husky cherry red I planted them from

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.210 
the husky cherry red I planted them from
little<00:02:14.819> ones<00:02:15.060> on<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.629> same<00:02:15.900> day<00:02:16.379> about<00:02:16.980> two

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
little ones on the same day about two

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.140 
little ones on the same day about two
months<00:02:17.459> ago

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
months ago

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.559 
months ago
if<00:02:18.209> you<00:02:18.450> notice<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.319> one<00:02:19.530> in<00:02:19.799> the<00:02:20.099> 40<00:02:20.579> is<00:02:20.790> quite

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
if you notice the one in the 40 is quite

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.929 
if you notice the one in the 40 is quite
a<00:02:21.599> bit<00:02:21.810> larger<00:02:22.290> than<00:02:22.439> the<00:02:22.590> one<00:02:22.799> in<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.280> 30<00:02:23.610> and

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:23.939 
a bit larger than the one in the 30 and

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:27.470 
a bit larger than the one in the 30 and
this<00:02:24.810> is<00:02:25.430> attributable<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.489> the<00:02:26.849> roots<00:02:27.060> if<00:02:27.269> you

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
this is attributable to the roots if you

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.050 
this is attributable to the roots if you
have<00:02:27.629> a<00:02:27.659> larger<00:02:28.260> pot<00:02:28.620> for<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.430> roots<00:02:29.760> to

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
have a larger pot for the roots to

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.069 
have a larger pot for the roots to
expand<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:31.290> plants<00:02:32.010> get<00:02:32.189> larger

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
expand the plants get larger

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:35.179 
expand the plants get larger
proportionately<00:02:34.079> but<00:02:34.709> I<00:02:34.739> don't<00:02:34.980> want<00:02:35.099> to

proportionately but I don't want to

performance of this tree or 30 because

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.619 
performance of this tree or 30 because
if<00:02:40.680> you<00:02:40.859> look<00:02:41.069> at<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.310> number<00:02:41.730> of<00:02:41.760> tomatoes<00:02:42.450> we

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
if you look at the number of tomatoes we

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.300 
if you look at the number of tomatoes we
have<00:02:42.840> on<00:02:42.959> our<00:02:43.109> husky<00:02:43.319> cherry<00:02:43.709> red<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:43.980> I<00:02:44.129> did

have on our husky cherry red and I did

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.099 
have on our husky cherry red and I did
something<00:02:44.700> a<00:02:44.760> little<00:02:44.939> bit<00:02:45.030> different<00:02:45.450> in<00:02:45.599> that

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
something a little bit different in that

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:48.890 
something a little bit different in that
I<00:02:46.140> planted<00:02:46.769> patio<00:02:47.489> tomatoes<00:02:48.120> which<00:02:48.750> are

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
I planted patio tomatoes which are

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.710 
I planted patio tomatoes which are
Tomatoes<00:02:49.319> with<00:02:49.560> larger<00:02:50.159> tomatoes<00:02:50.730> on<00:02:50.970> either

side of the husky cherry red and just

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.770 
side of the husky cherry red and just
take<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.470> look<00:02:55.859> at<00:02:56.129> the<00:02:56.670> clumps<00:02:57.090> of<00:02:57.239> patio

don't work wire the trellis system I

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.770 
don't work wire the trellis system I
simply<00:03:28.169> take<00:03:28.709> it<00:03:28.859> out<00:03:29.069> I've<00:03:29.669> under<00:03:30.209> planted

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
simply take it out I've under planted

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.259 
simply take it out I've under planted
the<00:03:30.900> diploid<00:03:31.260> a<00:03:31.440> Mia<00:03:31.680> with<00:03:32.280> caladiums

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
the diploid a Mia with caladiums

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.009 
the diploid a Mia with caladiums
that<00:03:33.840> are<00:03:34.109> actually<00:03:35.090> bred<00:03:36.090> for<00:03:36.359> Sun<00:03:36.540> which<00:03:36.840> is

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
that are actually bred for Sun which is

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.309 
that are actually bred for Sun which is
unusual<00:03:37.199> I<00:03:38.180> like<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.389> tree<00:03:39.569> aquatic<00:03:39.959> system

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
unusual I like the tree aquatic system

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:41.539 
unusual I like the tree aquatic system
and<00:03:40.470> I<00:03:40.500> think<00:03:40.530> what<00:03:40.769> I<00:03:40.799> like<00:03:41.069> about<00:03:41.220> it<00:03:41.430> the

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
and I think what I like about it the

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.270 
and I think what I like about it the
best<00:03:41.790> is<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.690> versatility<00:03:43.139> that<00:03:43.590> I<00:03:43.919> can<00:03:44.069> plant

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
best is the versatility that I can plant

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.009 
best is the versatility that I can plant
