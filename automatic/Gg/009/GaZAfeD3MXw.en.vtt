items around and introduce some new hero
items<00:00:28.660> so<00:00:28.840> I<00:00:29.050> thought<00:00:29.560> it<00:00:29.710> would<00:00:29.770> be<00:00:29.860> fun<00:00:30.039> just

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
items so I thought it would be fun just

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.439 
items so I thought it would be fun just
to<00:00:30.279> take<00:00:30.430> a<00:00:30.460> few<00:00:30.640> minutes<00:00:30.820> here<00:00:31.029> and<00:00:31.239> walk

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:31.449

through some of those new hero items in
case<00:00:33.070> you<00:00:33.220> hadn't<00:00:33.519> noticed<00:00:33.550> it<00:00:33.940> but<00:00:34.629> there's

you log in next take a look around the

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.009 
you log in next take a look around the
sword<00:00:40.239> there's<00:00:40.420> all<00:00:40.510> sorts<00:00:40.750> of<00:00:40.809> cool<00:00:40.960> stuff

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:43.089 
there so first up let's see these guys

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:45.450 
there so first up let's see these guys
here<00:00:43.269> builder<00:00:43.750> rifleman<00:00:44.320> hero<00:00:44.559> basically

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
here builder rifleman hero basically

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.950 
here builder rifleman hero basically
these<00:00:45.550> are<00:00:45.610> right<00:00:45.850> from<00:00:46.000> the<00:00:46.089> network<00:00:46.239> exactly

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
these are right from the network exactly

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.869 
these are right from the network exactly
like<00:00:47.110> engineers<00:00:47.680> at<00:00:47.890> level<00:00:48.159> 5<00:00:48.339> they<00:00:48.549> can<00:00:48.699> build

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
like engineers at level 5 they can build

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.000 
like engineers at level 5 they can build
machine<00:00:49.420> gun<00:00:49.570> nests<00:00:49.930> and<00:00:50.049> they<00:00:50.320> have<00:00:50.650> faster

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
machine gun nests and they have faster

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.829 
machine gun nests and they have faster
rate<00:00:51.159> of<00:00:51.250> fire<00:00:51.400> mines<00:00:51.850> barbed-wire<00:00:52.239> sand<00:00:52.390> bags

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:52.839 
rate of fire mines barbed-wire sand bags

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:54.329 
rate of fire mines barbed-wire sand bags
all<00:00:53.049> that<00:00:53.199> sort<00:00:53.440> of<00:00:53.500> thing<00:00:53.559> so<00:00:53.739> that<00:00:53.860> gives<00:00:54.100> an

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:54.339 
all that sort of thing so that gives an

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:55.950 
all that sort of thing so that gives an
interesting<00:00:54.879> alternative<00:00:54.970> to<00:00:55.510> Engineers

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
interesting alternative to Engineers

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.840 
interesting alternative to Engineers
later<00:00:56.500> on<00:00:56.739> I<00:00:56.920> don't<00:00:57.250> believe<00:00:57.519> that<00:00:57.580> they<00:00:57.820> can

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
later on I don't believe that they can

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.939 
later on I don't believe that they can
repair<00:00:58.330> vehicles<00:00:58.989> though<00:00:59.379> that's<00:00:59.619> the<00:00:59.680> only

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
repair vehicles though that's the only

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:02.700 
repair vehicles though that's the only
difference<00:01:00.250> that<00:01:00.430> I<00:01:00.909> can<00:01:01.119> detect<00:01:01.449> next<00:01:02.350> up<00:01:02.500> oh

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
difference that I can detect next up oh

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.730 
difference that I can detect next up oh
my<00:01:03.400> god<00:01:04.049> pyrotechnic<00:01:05.049> engineers<00:01:05.530> have<00:01:05.710> been

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
my god pyrotechnic engineers have been

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.490 
my god pyrotechnic engineers have been
introduced<00:01:06.369> these<00:01:07.060> dudes<00:01:07.330> starts<00:01:08.260> with<00:01:08.409> the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
introduced these dudes starts with the

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.649 
introduced these dudes starts with the
flamethrower<00:01:09.040> I<00:01:09.280> have<00:01:09.670> more<00:01:09.850> hit<00:01:10.030> points<00:01:10.060> they

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
flamethrower I have more hit points they

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:12.270 
flamethrower I have more hit points they
have<00:01:10.990> the<00:01:11.110> ability<00:01:11.200> to<00:01:11.470> throw<00:01:11.830> incendiary

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
have the ability to throw incendiary

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.999 
have the ability to throw incendiary
grenades<00:01:12.939> and<00:01:13.240> set<00:01:13.600> incendiary<00:01:13.990> traps<00:01:14.500> I<00:01:14.680> have

grenades and set incendiary traps I have

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:17.010 
grenades and set incendiary traps I have
no<00:01:15.250> idea<00:01:15.490> what<00:01:15.580> that<00:01:15.610> means<00:01:15.909> I<00:01:16.119> suspect<00:01:16.840> it's

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
no idea what that means I suspect it's

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.240 
no idea what that means I suspect it's
kind<00:01:17.200> of<00:01:17.229> like<00:01:17.320> a<00:01:17.380> burning<00:01:17.680> patch<00:01:17.979> on<00:01:18.159> the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
kind of like a burning patch on the

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.680 
kind of like a burning patch on the
ground<00:01:18.460> sort<00:01:18.729> of<00:01:18.790> like<00:01:18.909> a<00:01:18.939> nibble<00:01:19.210> wore<00:01:19.450> fur<00:01:19.600> or

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
ground sort of like a nibble wore fur or

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.000 
ground sort of like a nibble wore fur or
something<00:01:19.930> to<00:01:19.990> that<00:01:20.020> effect<00:01:20.320> but<00:01:20.380> who<00:01:20.830> knows

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
something to that effect but who knows

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.980 
something to that effect but who knows
we'll<00:01:21.190> have<00:01:21.310> to<00:01:21.430> see<00:01:21.580> where<00:01:21.790> that<00:01:22.030> is<00:01:22.210> and<00:01:22.390> at

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
we'll have to see where that is and at

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.720 
we'll have to see where that is and at
level<00:01:23.230> 5<00:01:23.410> they<00:01:23.590> get<00:01:23.710> a<00:01:23.740> second<00:01:24.250> flamethrower

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:24.730 
level 5 they get a second flamethrower

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.310 
level 5 they get a second flamethrower
that's<00:01:25.000> humongous<00:01:25.390> that's<00:01:25.900> going<00:01:26.050> to<00:01:26.110> really

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
that's humongous that's going to really

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.380 
that's humongous that's going to really
really<00:01:26.950> change<00:01:27.250> early<00:01:27.550> game<00:01:27.730> tactics<00:01:27.970> for

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
really change early game tactics for

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.480 
really change early game tactics for
anyone<00:01:28.660> who<00:01:28.750> has<00:01:28.990> access<00:01:29.320> to<00:01:29.650> that<00:01:29.740> engineer

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
anyone who has access to that engineer

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.510 
anyone who has access to that engineer
there<00:01:31.409> because<00:01:32.409> so<00:01:32.560> often<00:01:32.770> people<00:01:32.980> save<00:01:33.310> their

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
there because so often people save their

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.920 
there because so often people save their
first<00:01:33.730> 50<00:01:34.060> munitions<00:01:34.510> to<00:01:34.630> upgrade

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
first 50 munitions to upgrade

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.270 
first 50 munitions to upgrade
flamethrowers<00:01:35.440> on<00:01:35.560> their<00:01:35.680> early<00:01:35.890> engineers

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
flamethrowers on their early engineers

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.280 
flamethrowers on their early engineers
so<00:01:36.520> definitely<00:01:37.360> having<00:01:37.780> engineers<00:01:38.140> that

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
so definitely having engineers that

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.380 
so definitely having engineers that
start<00:01:38.650> with<00:01:38.710> not<00:01:39.010> one<00:01:39.190> but<00:01:39.250> two<00:01:39.640> flamethrowers

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
start with not one but two flamethrowers

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.870 
start with not one but two flamethrowers
oh<00:01:40.540> my<00:01:40.810> god<00:01:41.080> that's<00:01:41.260> ridiculous<00:01:41.890> next<00:01:42.760> up

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
oh my god that's ridiculous next up

barraging with grenades is but certainly

kind of meant to support all your troops

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.540 
kind of meant to support all your troops
it<00:04:47.320> appears<00:04:47.680> to<00:04:47.740> have<00:04:47.919> an<00:04:48.100> ability<00:04:48.310> called

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
it appears to have an ability called

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.510 
it appears to have an ability called
inspired<00:04:49.180> command<00:04:49.660> that<00:04:50.590> it<00:04:50.740> can<00:04:51.130> activate<00:04:51.460> I

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
inspired command that it can activate I

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.770 
inspired command that it can activate I
have<00:04:51.669> no<00:04:51.910> idea<00:04:52.150> what<00:04:52.270> the<00:04:52.330> cost<00:04:52.570> of<00:04:52.750> that

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
have no idea what the cost of that

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.510 
have no idea what the cost of that
ability<00:04:53.229> is<00:04:53.350> but<00:04:53.680> pretty<00:04:53.979> much<00:04:54.130> all<00:04:54.310> of<00:04:54.400> its

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
ability is but pretty much all of its

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.700 
ability is but pretty much all of its
leveling<00:04:54.940> has<00:04:55.479> to<00:04:55.660> do<00:04:55.780> with<00:04:55.900> increasing<00:04:56.620> that

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
leveling has to do with increasing that

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:57.870 
leveling has to do with increasing that
abilities<00:04:57.100> effects<00:04:57.400> so<00:04:57.520> you<00:04:57.580> can<00:04:57.699> see<00:04:57.789> at

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
abilities effects so you can see at

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.670 
abilities effects so you can see at
level<00:04:58.150> 1<00:04:58.300> it<00:04:58.449> increases<00:04:58.930> the<00:04:59.050> offense<00:04:59.440> defense

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
level 1 it increases the offense defense

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.219 
level 1 it increases the offense defense
and<00:05:00.039> mobility<00:05:00.340> of<00:05:00.580> all<00:05:00.759> nearby<00:05:01.030> units<00:05:01.229> at

increased by twenty-five percent at
level<00:05:05.800> three<00:05:06.039> it<00:05:06.130> gets<00:05:06.310> ten<00:05:06.490> more<00:05:06.639> percent

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
level three it gets ten more percent

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.820 
level three it gets ten more percent
health<00:05:07.240> and<00:05:08.400> it<00:05:09.400> also<00:05:09.610> gains<00:05:09.970> armored<00:05:10.419> skirts

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830

ability now grants health regeneration

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.320 
ability now grants health regeneration
at<00:05:17.110> level<00:05:17.380> for<00:05:17.620> this<00:05:17.889> this<00:05:18.760> whole<00:05:18.910> thing<00:05:19.150> gets

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
at level for this this whole thing gets

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.689 
at level for this this whole thing gets
upgraded<00:05:19.479> so<00:05:19.930> it<00:05:20.080> gets<00:05:20.250> armored<00:05:21.250> skirts<00:05:21.520> and

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:21.699 
upgraded so it gets armored skirts and

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:23.700 
upgraded so it gets armored skirts and
it<00:05:21.789> gets<00:05:21.880> a<00:05:22.000> gunner<00:05:22.270> Manning<00:05:22.750> its<00:05:22.870> mg<00:05:23.139> 42<00:05:23.530> so

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
it gets a gunner Manning its mg 42 so

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.320 
it gets a gunner Manning its mg 42 so
it's<00:05:23.830> like<00:05:23.949> an<00:05:24.070> upgraded<00:05:24.460> panzer<00:05:24.789> at<00:05:24.910> level<00:05:25.120> 4

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
it's like an upgraded panzer at level 4

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.360 
it's like an upgraded panzer at level 4
and<00:05:25.630> level<00:05:26.080> 5<00:05:26.260> its<00:05:26.500> ability<00:05:26.860> duration<00:05:27.250> is

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
and level 5 its ability duration is

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.920 
and level 5 its ability duration is
increased<00:05:27.699> its<00:05:27.940> recharge<00:05:28.360> time<00:05:28.419> is<00:05:28.780> reduced

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
increased its recharge time is reduced

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.610 
increased its recharge time is reduced
and<00:05:29.320> it<00:05:30.100> also<00:05:30.310> in<00:05:30.789> boost<00:05:31.570> damage<00:05:31.960> so<00:05:32.139> again<00:05:32.590> I

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
and it also in boost damage so again I

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:33.930 
and it also in boost damage so again I
have<00:05:32.800> no<00:05:32.889> idea<00:05:33.099> what<00:05:33.190> the<00:05:33.250> cost<00:05:33.490> on<00:05:33.639> that<00:05:33.699> is

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
have no idea what the cost on that is

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.120 
have no idea what the cost on that is
but<00:05:34.210> that's<00:05:34.330> certainly<00:05:34.599> a<00:05:35.050> noteworthy<00:05:35.590> hero

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
but that's certainly a noteworthy hero

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.520 
but that's certainly a noteworthy hero
item<00:05:36.460> to<00:05:37.090> add<00:05:37.240> to<00:05:37.270> your<00:05:37.419> armies<00:05:37.810> just<00:05:38.169> given

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
item to add to your armies just given

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.230 
item to add to your armies just given
the<00:05:38.620> effect<00:05:38.919> that<00:05:38.979> it<00:05:39.130> has<00:05:39.160> on<00:05:39.310> so<00:05:39.789> many<00:05:39.910> units

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
the effect that it has on so many units

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.850 
the effect that it has on so many units
so<00:05:40.419> that's<00:05:40.960> pretty<00:05:41.139> cool<00:05:41.229> let's<00:05:41.500> take<00:05:41.650> a<00:05:41.680> look

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
so that's pretty cool let's take a look

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.140 
so that's pretty cool let's take a look
around<00:05:41.949> here<00:05:42.220> there<00:05:42.340> are<00:05:42.430> two<00:05:42.580> more<00:05:42.729> awesome

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
around here there are two more awesome

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.750 
around here there are two more awesome
items<00:05:44.110> out<00:05:44.259> here<00:05:44.410> so<00:05:44.530> the<00:05:44.710> mammoth<00:05:45.099> stug<00:05:45.430> mark

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
items out here so the mammoth stug mark

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.020 
items out here so the mammoth stug mark
for<00:05:46.060> this<00:05:46.510> is<00:05:46.690> pretty<00:05:46.870> curious<00:05:47.430> again<00:05:48.430> this<00:05:48.880> is

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
for this is pretty curious again this is

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:50.700 
for this is pretty curious again this is
what<00:05:49.180> I'll<00:05:49.300> have<00:05:49.449> to<00:05:49.599> see<00:05:49.750> because<00:05:49.930> it<00:05:50.470> seems

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
what I'll have to see because it seems

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.529 
what I'll have to see because it seems
kind<00:05:50.919> of<00:05:50.949> strange<00:05:51.099> but<00:05:51.430> first<00:05:51.880> off<00:05:52.060> it<00:05:52.210> has<00:05:52.360> a

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:52.539 
kind of strange but first off it has a

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:54.000 
kind of strange but first off it has a
hundred<00:05:52.990> percent<00:05:53.050> increased<00:05:53.500> hit<00:05:53.650> points<00:05:53.889> so

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
hundred percent increased hit points so

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.040 
hundred percent increased hit points so
double<00:05:54.430> hit<00:05:54.550> points<00:05:54.820> for<00:05:54.970> this<00:05:55.060> thing<00:05:55.270> receive

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
double hit points for this thing receive

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.870 
double hit points for this thing receive
penetration<00:05:56.710> increased<00:05:57.190> by<00:05:57.340> one<00:05:57.699> hundred

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880 
penetration increased by one hundred

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.540 
penetration increased by one hundred
percent<00:05:58.060> I<00:05:58.800> that<00:05:59.800> sounds<00:06:00.010> to<00:06:00.220> me<00:06:00.310> like<00:06:00.340> it

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
percent I that sounds to me like it

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:01.800 
percent I that sounds to me like it
takes<00:06:00.729> double<00:06:01.030> damage<00:06:01.330> from<00:06:01.479> armor

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
takes double damage from armor

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:02.909 
takes double damage from armor
penetrating<00:06:02.260> shots<00:06:02.470> so<00:06:02.590> that's<00:06:02.710> kind<00:06:02.889> of

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:02.919 
penetrating shots so that's kind of

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:05.279 
penetrating shots so that's kind of
strange<00:06:03.070> but<00:06:03.400> and<00:06:04.270> its<00:06:04.570> speed<00:06:05.139> and

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:05.289 
strange but and its speed and

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:06.779 
strange but and its speed and
acceleration<00:06:05.500> are<00:06:05.919> reduced<00:06:06.250> by<00:06:06.430> fifty

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:06.789 
acceleration are reduced by fifty

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:08.490 
acceleration are reduced by fifty
percent<00:06:06.940> so<00:06:07.270> I<00:06:07.479> think<00:06:07.690> the<00:06:07.930> theme<00:06:08.169> here<00:06:08.409> is

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
percent so I think the theme here is

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.730 
percent so I think the theme here is
that<00:06:08.590> it's<00:06:08.710> a<00:06:08.800> big<00:06:09.010> slow<00:06:09.400> tank<00:06:10.020> as<00:06:11.020> it<00:06:11.470> gets

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:11.740 
that it's a big slow tank as it gets

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.920 
that it's a big slow tank as it gets
higher<00:06:12.250> level<00:06:12.639> it's<00:06:12.820> got<00:06:12.970> more<00:06:13.419> armor

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
higher level it's got more armor

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.570 
higher level it's got more armor
penetration<00:06:14.110> and<00:06:14.830> its<00:06:15.190> speed<00:06:15.460> and

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:15.580 
penetration and its speed and

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.180 
penetration and its speed and
acceleration<00:06:15.820> go<00:06:16.300> up<00:06:16.419> by<00:06:16.539> fifty<00:06:16.870> percent<00:06:17.190> hit

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.190 
acceleration go up by fifty percent hit

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:19.560 
acceleration go up by fifty percent hit
points<00:06:18.490> go<00:06:18.610> up<00:06:18.639> and<00:06:18.970> then<00:06:19.090> at<00:06:19.180> level<00:06:19.389> five

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:19.570

speed<00:06:20.169> goes<00:06:20.349> up<00:06:20.380> by<00:06:20.620> fifty<00:06:20.949> percent<00:06:21.070> and<00:06:21.490> so

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 
speed goes up by fifty percent and so

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.460 
speed goes up by fifty percent and so
does<00:06:22.060> acceleration<00:06:22.750> so<00:06:22.900> it<00:06:23.050> seems<00:06:23.229> to<00:06:23.349> me<00:06:23.440> like

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:23.470 
does acceleration so it seems to me like

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:24.960 
does acceleration so it seems to me like
this<00:06:23.650> thing<00:06:23.860> speeds<00:06:24.159> up<00:06:24.370> as<00:06:24.490> it<00:06:24.639> gets<00:06:24.849> higher

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:24.970 
this thing speeds up as it gets higher

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:26.790 
this thing speeds up as it gets higher

that's<00:07:10.010> great<00:07:10.370> extra<00:07:11.210> damage<00:07:11.360> if<00:07:11.660> you<00:07:11.750> and

that's great extra damage if you and

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.080 
that's great extra damage if you and
that's<00:07:12.440> sort<00:07:12.590> of<00:07:12.680> that<00:07:13.580> sort<00:07:13.760> of<00:07:13.790> stuff<00:07:13.940> is

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:14.090 
that's sort of that sort of stuff is

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:15.700 
that's sort of that sort of stuff is
really<00:07:14.210> cool<00:07:14.450> and<00:07:14.600> then<00:07:15.230> at<00:07:15.350> level<00:07:15.560> five

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:15.710 
really cool and then at level five

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:17.680 
really cool and then at level five
greatly<00:07:16.250> improved<00:07:16.640> site<00:07:16.880> and<00:07:17.060> detection<00:07:17.360> for

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:17.690 
greatly improved site and detection for

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:20.260 
greatly improved site and detection for
a<00:07:17.720> short<00:07:17.990> period<00:07:18.050> of<00:07:18.380> time<00:07:18.440> so<00:07:18.830> I<00:07:19.040> guess<00:07:19.940> it<00:07:20.090> has

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:20.270 
a short period of time so I guess it has

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:22.030 
a short period of time so I guess it has
some<00:07:20.510> sort<00:07:20.690> of<00:07:20.720> activated<00:07:21.230> ability<00:07:21.590> no<00:07:21.800> idea

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:22.040 
some sort of activated ability no idea

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.220 
some sort of activated ability no idea
on<00:07:22.130> the<00:07:22.190> munitions<00:07:22.580> cost<00:07:22.820> there<00:07:23.090> that<00:07:23.510> boosted

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:24.230 
on the munitions cost there that boosted

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.650 
on the munitions cost there that boosted
sight<00:07:24.440> range<00:07:24.650> and<00:07:24.860> all<00:07:24.950> of<00:07:25.070> that<00:07:25.280> so<00:07:25.580> just<00:07:26.570> a

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:26.660 
sight range and all of that so just a

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.060 
sight range and all of that so just a
just<00:07:26.930> a<00:07:27.020> quick<00:07:27.200> preview<00:07:27.380> there's<00:07:27.710> a<00:07:27.770> bunch<00:07:27.980> of

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:28.070 
just a quick preview there's a bunch of
