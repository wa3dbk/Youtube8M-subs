well<00:00:00.359> I'm<00:00:00.480> standing<00:00:00.840> out<00:00:00.989> here<00:00:01.020> in<00:00:01.260> a<00:00:01.439> field<00:00:01.740> of

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
well I'm standing out here in a field of

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.550 
well I'm standing out here in a field of
ours<00:00:02.399> in<00:00:02.700> Macon<00:00:03.030> County<00:00:03.240> Illinois<00:00:03.540> just<00:00:04.440> a

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
ours in Macon County Illinois just a

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.030 
ours in Macon County Illinois just a
little<00:00:04.770> bit<00:00:04.890> northwest<00:00:05.460> of<00:00:05.670> Decatur<00:00:06.060> and

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:07.040 
little bit northwest of Decatur and

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.560 
little bit northwest of Decatur and
started<00:00:08.040> to<00:00:08.160> see<00:00:08.340> some<00:00:08.580> pictures<00:00:08.820> and<00:00:09.059> maybe

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
started to see some pictures and maybe

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.470 
started to see some pictures and maybe
here's<00:00:09.840> some<00:00:10.019> reports<00:00:10.590> of<00:00:10.910> the<00:00:11.910> corn<00:00:12.210> yield

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
here's some reports of the corn yield

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.039 
here's some reports of the corn yield
maybe<00:00:12.780> just<00:00:13.110> not<00:00:13.170> being<00:00:13.500> as<00:00:13.860> top<00:00:14.610> end<00:00:14.940> as<00:00:15.179> what

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
maybe just not being as top end as what

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.460 
maybe just not being as top end as what
we<00:00:16.199> thought<00:00:16.410> maybe<00:00:16.619> two<00:00:16.949> or<00:00:16.980> three<00:00:17.160> weeks<00:00:17.400> ago

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
we thought maybe two or three weeks ago

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.410 
we thought maybe two or three weeks ago
it<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.680> true<00:00:19.980> we<00:00:20.189> haven't<00:00:20.520> had<00:00:20.640> much<00:00:20.850> rain<00:00:21.180> here

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
it is true we haven't had much rain here

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.800 
it is true we haven't had much rain here
in<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.630> last<00:00:21.840> month<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:22.619> looked<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.340> last

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
in the last month I looked the last

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.509 
in the last month I looked the last
significant<00:00:24.810> rainfall<00:00:24.990> we<00:00:25.410> had<00:00:25.590> was<00:00:25.890> July

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
significant rainfall we had was July

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.490 
significant rainfall we had was July
tenth<00:00:26.849> we<00:00:27.119> had<00:00:27.269> about<00:00:27.480> three<00:00:27.840> inches<00:00:28.140> of<00:00:28.199> rain

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
tenth we had about three inches of rain

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.060 
tenth we had about three inches of rain
right<00:00:28.740> here<00:00:28.970> since<00:00:29.970> then<00:00:30.619> we've<00:00:31.619> had<00:00:31.650> less

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
right here since then we've had less

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.479 
right here since then we've had less
than<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.369> half<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.730> an<00:00:32.880> inch<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.329> so<00:00:34.430> it's<00:00:35.430> a

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
than a half of an inch and so it's a

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.459 
than a half of an inch and so it's a
little<00:00:35.610> bit<00:00:35.730> concerned<00:00:36.329> about<00:00:36.510> tip<00:00:36.930> back<00:00:37.140> and

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
little bit concerned about tip back and

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.319 
little bit concerned about tip back and
and<00:00:37.710> how<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.920> ears<00:00:38.219> look<00:00:38.489> now<00:00:38.760> compared<00:00:39.239> to

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
and how the ears look now compared to

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.760 
and how the ears look now compared to
what<00:00:39.629> they<00:00:39.780> look<00:00:39.989> like<00:00:40.020> when<00:00:40.230> i<00:00:40.410> did<00:00:40.620> my

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
what they look like when i did my

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.010 
what they look like when i did my
original<00:00:41.219> yield<00:00:41.460> checks<00:00:41.760> like<00:00:42.570> i<00:00:42.690> said<00:00:42.750> maybe

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
original yield checks like i said maybe

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.090 
original yield checks like i said maybe
two<00:00:43.290> or<00:00:43.320> three<00:00:43.469> weeks<00:00:43.680> ago<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.420> so<00:00:45.980> what<00:00:46.980> I've

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
two or three weeks ago and so what I've

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.340 
two or three weeks ago and so what I've
done<00:00:47.129> here<00:00:47.340> like<00:00:48.149> I've<00:00:48.329> done<00:00:48.450> in<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.629> past<00:00:48.719> is

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
done here like I've done in the past is

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.869 
done here like I've done in the past is
just<00:00:50.030> shocked<00:00:51.030> basically<00:00:51.870> every<00:00:52.379> year<00:00:53.370> that

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
just shocked basically every year that

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.650 
just shocked basically every year that
was<00:00:54.059> in<00:00:54.300> within<00:00:55.140> 17<00:00:55.800> feet<00:00:56.550> five<00:00:56.910> inches<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.480> row

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
was in within 17 feet five inches of row

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.549 
was in within 17 feet five inches of row
or<00:00:57.840> one<00:00:58.050> one<00:00:58.260> thousandth<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.800> an<00:00:58.949> acre<00:00:59.100> and

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
or one one thousandth of an acre and

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.460 
or one one thousandth of an acre and
what<00:01:01.559> I've<00:01:01.680> been<00:01:01.800> finding<00:01:02.100> here<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:03.470> we're

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
what I've been finding here is we're

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.210 
what I've been finding here is we're
starting<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.920> see<00:01:04.949> some<00:01:05.369> tip<00:01:05.580> back<00:01:05.790> here<00:01:06.090> maybe

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
starting to see some tip back here maybe

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.920 
starting to see some tip back here maybe
maybe<00:01:08.220> about<00:01:08.549> an<00:01:08.729> inch<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.150> two<00:01:09.330> inches<00:01:09.360> on

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
maybe about an inch to two inches on

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.380 
maybe about an inch to two inches on
each<00:01:10.140> year<00:01:13.369> let's<00:01:14.369> see<00:01:14.670> if<00:01:14.760> we<00:01:14.850> can<00:01:15.030> find<00:01:15.210> a

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
each year let's see if we can find a

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.760 
each year let's see if we can find a
better<00:01:16.970> there<00:01:17.970> we<00:01:18.119> go<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:19.080> kind<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.380> see<00:01:19.560> that

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
better there we go and kind of see that

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.649 
better there we go and kind of see that
one<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.280> two<00:01:20.460> inches<00:01:20.490> right<00:01:21.030> here<00:01:21.270> at<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.540> end

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
one to two inches right here at the end

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.770 
one to two inches right here at the end
of<00:01:21.750> each<00:01:21.869> year<00:01:22.009> just<00:01:23.009> not<00:01:23.189> really<00:01:23.640> filling<00:01:24.600> out

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
of each year just not really filling out

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.070 
of each year just not really filling out
right<00:01:25.140> now<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:26.689> so<00:01:27.689> what<00:01:27.930> does<00:01:28.049> that

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
right now and so what does that

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.560 
right now and so what does that
translate<00:01:28.650> into<00:01:28.799> yield<00:01:29.460> well<00:01:29.909> in<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.299> case

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
translate into yield well in this case

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.300 
translate into yield well in this case
my<00:01:31.290> my<00:01:32.280> girth<00:01:32.640> or<00:01:32.960> kernels<00:01:33.960> around<00:01:34.320> was<00:01:34.770> 16

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
my my girth or kernels around was 16

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.179 
my my girth or kernels around was 16
right<00:01:35.729> at<00:01:35.909> 16<00:01:36.390> for<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:36.840> one<00:01:37.560> one<00:01:37.740> thousandth

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
right at 16 for this one one thousandth

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.640 
right at 16 for this one one thousandth
of<00:01:38.280> an<00:01:38.400> acre<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.820> my<00:01:39.630> length<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.229> kernels

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
of an acre and my length and kernels

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.819 
of an acre and my length and kernels
ended<00:01:40.979> up<00:01:41.100> being<00:01:41.340> 33<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.210> half<00:01:42.470> now<00:01:43.470> three

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
ended up being 33 and a half now three

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.190 
ended up being 33 and a half now three
about<00:01:44.340> two<00:01:44.520> or<00:01:44.670> three<00:01:44.850> weeks<00:01:45.000> ago<00:01:45.240> my<00:01:45.930> length

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
about two or three weeks ago my length

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.389 
about two or three weeks ago my length
was<00:01:46.439> between<00:01:46.710> 38<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.430> 40<00:01:48.350> and<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.860> that

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
was between 38 and 40 and so that

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.510 
was between 38 and 40 and so that
translates<00:01:51.149> into<00:01:51.360> approximately<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.890> 20

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
translates into approximately a 20

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.350 
translates into approximately a 20
bushel<00:01:53.939> per<00:01:53.970> acre<00:01:55.729> difference<00:01:56.729> between<00:01:57.149> two

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
bushel per acre difference between two

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.310 
bushel per acre difference between two
or<00:01:57.390> three<00:01:57.659> weeks<00:01:57.810> ago<00:01:58.610> so<00:01:59.610> uh<00:02:00.390> well<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:00.990> was

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
or three weeks ago so uh well I was

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.770 
or three weeks ago so uh well I was
about<00:02:01.680> two<00:02:01.920> weeks<00:02:02.460> ago<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:02.820> was<00:02:03.149> thinking<00:02:03.630> maybe

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
about two weeks ago I was thinking maybe

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.359 
about two weeks ago I was thinking maybe
a<00:02:04.079> little<00:02:04.259> bit<00:02:04.469> over<00:02:04.710> two<00:02:04.890> hundred<00:02:05.009> bushels

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
a little bit over two hundred bushels

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.540 
a little bit over two hundred bushels
per<00:02:05.610> acre<00:02:05.759> 2022<00:02:06.659> 205<00:02:07.590> somewhere<00:02:08.039> in<00:02:08.129> there<00:02:08.340> and

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
per acre 2022 205 somewhere in there and

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.229 
per acre 2022 205 somewhere in there and
this<00:02:09.209> figures<00:02:09.599> out<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.989> about<00:02:10.110> 180<00:02:11.239> 178

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
this figures out to about 180 178

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.640 
this figures out to about 180 178
actually<00:02:12.810> I'm

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
actually I'm

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.020 
actually I'm
at<00:02:13.769> 16<00:02:14.519> around<00:02:14.959> x<00:02:16.040> 33<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.159> a<00:02:17.189> half<00:02:17.400> long<00:02:17.700> and

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
at 16 around x 33 and a half long and

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.059 
at 16 around x 33 and a half long and
the<00:02:18.959> 30,000<00:02:19.739> population<00:02:20.489> and<00:02:21.950> dividing<00:02:22.950> that

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
the 30,000 population and dividing that

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.270 
the 30,000 population and dividing that
by<00:02:23.239> 90,000<00:02:24.239> kernels<00:02:24.569> per<00:02:24.750> bushel<00:02:24.989> so<00:02:25.769> yeah<00:02:26.040> at

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
by 90,000 kernels per bushel so yeah at

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.920 
by 90,000 kernels per bushel so yeah at
least<00:02:26.430> in<00:02:26.670> this<00:02:26.819> field<00:02:27.150> right<00:02:27.420> here<00:02:27.750> we're

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
least in this field right here we're

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.690 
least in this field right here we're
starting<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.379> see<00:02:28.409> some<00:02:28.829> tip<00:02:29.040> back<00:02:29.250> because<00:02:29.670> of

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
starting to see some tip back because of

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.839 
starting to see some tip back because of
the<00:02:29.939> lack<00:02:30.120> of<00:02:30.150> rainfall<00:02:30.540> I<00:02:31.019> think<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.849> the

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
the lack of rainfall I think the the

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.270 
the lack of rainfall I think the the
cooler<00:02:33.180> temperatures<00:02:33.720> have<00:02:33.900> helped<00:02:34.290> that

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
cooler temperatures have helped that

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.849 
cooler temperatures have helped that
cool<00:02:35.489> nights<00:02:35.790> certainly<00:02:36.359> have<00:02:36.450> helped<00:02:36.859> the

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:37.859 
cool nights certainly have helped the

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:39.559 
cool nights certainly have helped the
respiration<00:02:38.430> of<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.790> plant<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:39.209> filling

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
respiration of the plant and filling

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.819 
respiration of the plant and filling
these<00:02:39.689> these<00:02:40.680> ears<00:02:41.010> out<00:02:41.250> but<00:02:42.439> we<00:02:43.439> do<00:02:43.590> need<00:02:43.799> a

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
these these ears out but we do need a

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.800 
these these ears out but we do need a
rain<00:02:44.069> here<00:02:44.310> in<00:02:44.340> central<00:02:44.760> Illinois<00:02:45.090> believe<00:02:45.690> it

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
rain here in central Illinois believe it

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.860 
rain here in central Illinois believe it
or<00:02:45.930> not<00:02:46.049> forecast<00:02:46.829> doesn't<00:02:47.099> look<00:02:47.250> great<00:02:47.870> seven

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
or not forecast doesn't look great seven

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.629 
or not forecast doesn't look great seven
to<00:02:48.959> 10<00:02:49.200> day<00:02:49.379> doesn't<00:02:49.799> really<00:02:49.980> have<00:02:50.190> any<00:02:50.370> rain

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:50.639 
to 10 day doesn't really have any rain

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:53.559 
to 10 day doesn't really have any rain
chance<00:02:51.000> at<00:02:51.180> all<00:02:51.329> in<00:02:51.480> it<00:02:51.599> at<00:02:51.720> this<00:02:51.870> point<00:02:52.139> but

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
chance at all in it at this point but

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.030 
chance at all in it at this point but
like<00:02:54.569> I<00:02:54.720> said<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:55.079> cool<00:02:55.230> temps<00:02:55.620> have<00:02:55.739> helped

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
like I said the cool temps have helped

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.179 
like I said the cool temps have helped
and<00:02:56.810> we'll<00:02:57.810> just<00:02:57.930> continue<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.470> monitor<00:02:58.709> this

00:02:59.179 --> 00:02:59.189 
and we'll just continue to monitor this

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:01.009 
and we'll just continue to monitor this
and<00:02:59.519> see<00:02:59.730> where<00:02:59.939> we<00:03:00.090> end<00:03:00.120> up<00:03:00.450> here<00:03:00.720> but

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
and see where we end up here but

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.920 
and see where we end up here but
certainly<00:03:01.889> better<00:03:02.159> than<00:03:02.310> last<00:03:02.609> year<00:03:03.000> where<00:03:03.750> we

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
certainly better than last year where we

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.030 
certainly better than last year where we
were<00:03:04.760> you<00:03:05.760> know<00:03:05.879> anywhere<00:03:06.599> from<00:03:06.659> 60<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:07.319> 150

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
were you know anywhere from 60 to 150

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.280 
were you know anywhere from 60 to 150
bushels<00:03:08.670> we're<00:03:09.359> definitely<00:03:09.569> looking<00:03:09.930> a<00:03:10.139> lot

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
bushels we're definitely looking a lot

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.250 
bushels we're definitely looking a lot
better<00:03:10.349> than<00:03:10.739> last<00:03:10.769> year<00:03:11.250> but<00:03:11.430> definitely

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
better than last year but definitely

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.899 
better than last year but definitely
looking<00:03:13.260> like<00:03:13.439> we're<00:03:13.709> going<00:03:13.859> to<00:03:13.980> our<00:03:14.430> top<00:03:14.670> in

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
looking like we're going to our top in

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:17.119 
looking like we're going to our top in
maybe<00:03:15.239> maybe<00:03:15.900> scaling<00:03:16.560> back<00:03:16.709> just<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:17.099> little

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
maybe maybe scaling back just a little

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.420 
maybe maybe scaling back just a little
bit<00:03:17.370> here<00:03:17.780> so<00:03:18.780> I<00:03:19.290> guess<00:03:19.590> that's<00:03:19.919> the<00:03:20.069> story

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
bit here so I guess that's the story

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.460 
bit here so I guess that's the story
from<00:03:20.669> this<00:03:20.940> one<00:03:21.180> field<00:03:21.510> here<00:03:21.930> of<00:03:22.049> ours<00:03:22.260> in

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
from this one field here of ours in

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.280 
from this one field here of ours in
central<00:03:22.859> Illinois<00:03:23.329> be<00:03:24.329> checking<00:03:24.750> more<00:03:24.959> and<00:03:25.169> if

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
central Illinois be checking more and if

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.110 
central Illinois be checking more and if
if<00:03:25.620> there's<00:03:25.949> anything<00:03:26.190> else<00:03:26.459> significant

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
if there's anything else significant

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.129 
if there's anything else significant
I'll<00:03:27.269> certainly<00:03:27.690> be<00:03:27.840> posting<00:03:28.440> it<00:03:28.560> thank<00:03:28.949> you
