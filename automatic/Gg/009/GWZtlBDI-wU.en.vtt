00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:10.679
 look for that and continue 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.960
 rich of images has microsoft 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.929
 windows 8 has its own app the photos app 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.930
 donated so are numerous 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.580
 options available but am 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.500
 Of course, the beginning is the insertion of the 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.019
 pictures so how come the pictures 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.369
 for example, from the hard disk 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.439
 the tablet so it keeps coming back 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.240
 I would like to see them in 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.329
 show this video 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.710
 here are the photos aep there you see 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.680
 sometimes the different ones 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.050
 possibilities you have to pictures on 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.210
 to represent tablet belongs to it 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.320
 of course, the library on the 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.200
 tablet or record 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.350
 also a hard disk but also skydrive 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.510
 as pictures of facebook are flickr and 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.920
 various devices on the tablet 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.469
 are connected 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.550
 Let's take a look at pictures here 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:00.039
 the library succeeded 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.329
 as you can see right now is the 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:04.299
 library still empty 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.899
 but there is a whole way to it 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:08.140
 remedy 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:10.060
 open the desktop app 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.920
 windows explorer 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.920
 and branch to it 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.930
 work on which her pictures are 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:24.070
 in this case it is multimedia de 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.070
 tap the picture folder 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.610
 put your finger on the folder 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:31.770
 little longer and here they can 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:35.119
 tap to record the library 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.119
 and pictures 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.190
 then she saw please here 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.030
 away from windows in the folder folder that 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:46.310
 drive latched 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.310
 go back to the photo app 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.460
 and then they look like magic 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.420
 Here are the pictures that are in 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.420
 this drive 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.420
 that is the one variant 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.969
 and your own variant means that 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.159
 they in turn go to the desktop 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.450
 and instead of the pictures with this folder 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.550
 link here 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.340
 Just go here by drag and drop 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.849
 and copy the pictures into the folder 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.849
 images 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.450
 and pretty 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.730
 pictures there and then they do not have to 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.500
 every time the hard drive with the tablet 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.300
 but have full access 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.300
 on your picture library 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.430
 and go see you then have them 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:32.870
 different pictures you now on 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.700
 have copied the tray 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.830
 These are the different possibilities 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.930
 you would be using the photos app in it 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.560
