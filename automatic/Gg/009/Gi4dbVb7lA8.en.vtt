00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 good morning omniscient anuschka 15 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.400
 Write me I have a salad 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.649
 I would rather have one 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.690
 schnitzel now anuschka 15 that's all 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.610
 normal no human likes salad and everyone 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.750
 would rather have a schnitzel anyway 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.429
 you have a salad in front of you 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.870
 you probably want to live a healthy life 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.910
 and so does one in the gym 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.410
 even though you do not register at all 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.029
 wants to do sports but believes the 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.000
 monthly fees would be one 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.470
 somehow force it 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.269
 so you go to the supermarket and 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.039
 bought salad but if you go back to 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.689
 home is you want a schnitzel 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.579
 a dilemma that the science since 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.309
 but tried to solve it for decades 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.980
 unfortunately in vain until today because I 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.510
 just present salad schnitzel 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.370
 salad schnitzel combines the 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.410
 health promoting effect of salad 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.760
 with the delicious taste of schnitzel 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.590
 for a real salad schnitzel 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.809
 you need a tender one first 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.460
 Juicy piece of salad best from the 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.989
 Shoulder or the back you have to 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.180
 then place a bit and 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.129
 then bread for the banal 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.350
 do you need mail breadcrumbs and a 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.390
 small tip the panade I would be fine 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.559
 spice up between us that's it 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.420
 only after the salad schnitzel 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.240
 the salad will taste afterwards 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.369
 tip in flour then turn in and 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.049
 Finally in breadcrumbs then again 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.479
 Best of all, weird experiments 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.280
 with two paper plates on both sides 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.380
 do the half dani in the cut and 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.000
 turn in breadcrumbs that that 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.560
 salad schnitzel is finished breaded 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.689
 Do you realize that you are in the kitchen 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.070
 a huge hate organized and hate 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.259
 two days later to the 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.759
 most impossible places leftovers and breadcrumbs 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.530
 now you just have to find it 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.270
 Heat some oil in the pan 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.500
 think more is more finally 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.360
 it should not be after salad after 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.979
 then taste the salad schnitzel gently 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.350
 slide into the pan golden brown 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.829
 sautÃ© and roast again for a short time 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.540
 and then it's ready salad schnitzel 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.520
 humanity had to be on it for a long time 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.619
 wait now it is possible 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.880
 healthy salads that looks and tastes 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.610
 like a schnitzel 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.470
 The world is perfect because that is 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.329
 not everything has long been working on 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.979
 other salad treats such as 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.649
 Example of this made fast 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.259
 juicy salad walker with extra cheese 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.960
 or my personal favorite the salad 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.820
 Currywurst 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.080
 that looks so delicious but 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:12.650
 Of course we will try before that 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:14.930
 our delicious salad schnitzel tastes 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.000
 actually after schnitzel and after 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:23.060
 salad and a bit too 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:25.280
 after egg cake the salad schnitzel yes 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.290
 is there really the world is saved 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.300

 coast and see you soon 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:59.480

00:02:50.150 --> 00:03:02.230
 Juicy salad currywurst is still 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.230
 an early prototype
