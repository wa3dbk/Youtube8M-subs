00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
is the key number one point to a pencil

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.860 
is the key number one point to a pencil
skirt<00:03:27.349> that's<00:03:27.530> what<00:03:27.650> a<00:03:27.680> pencil<00:03:28.010> skirt<00:03:28.190> is<00:03:28.870> but

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
skirt that's what a pencil skirt is but

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.449 
skirt that's what a pencil skirt is but
it<00:03:30.230> does<00:03:30.470> have<00:03:30.680> a<00:03:30.709> little<00:03:30.829> bit<00:03:30.950> more<00:03:31.130> room<00:03:31.400> to

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
it does have a little bit more room to

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.339 
it does have a little bit more room to
walk<00:03:31.819> so<00:03:32.030> you're<00:03:32.150> not<00:03:32.299> walking<00:03:32.569> you<00:03:33.230> could

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:33.349 
walk so you're not walking you could

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:35.680 
walk so you're not walking you could
take<00:03:33.530> a<00:03:33.560> huge<00:03:33.919> step<00:03:34.190> and<00:03:34.220> it's<00:03:34.519> it's<00:03:35.150> okay

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
take a huge step and it's it's okay

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.440 
take a huge step and it's it's okay
finally<00:03:36.169> I<00:03:36.349> like<00:03:36.650> it<00:03:36.799> to<00:03:36.950> hit<00:03:37.310> right<00:03:37.790> about<00:03:38.239> the

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
finally I like it to hit right about the

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.210 
finally I like it to hit right about the
knee<00:03:38.630> or<00:03:38.930> a<00:03:39.169> little<00:03:39.799> bit<00:03:39.919> below

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
knee or a little bit below

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.129 
knee or a little bit below
not<00:03:40.700> too<00:03:40.940> much<00:03:41.090> below<00:03:41.389> because<00:03:41.660> then<00:03:41.870> it<00:03:41.959> looks

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:42.139 
not too much below because then it looks

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:43.990 
not too much below because then it looks
too<00:03:42.349> long<00:03:42.590> and<00:03:42.919> not<00:03:43.280> too<00:03:43.340> short<00:03:43.579> because

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
too long and not too short because

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.479 
too long and not too short because
that's<00:03:44.569> obviously<00:03:44.750> not<00:03:45.260> work<00:03:45.829> appropriate

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
that's obviously not work appropriate

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:47.860 
that's obviously not work appropriate
and<00:03:46.700> it<00:03:47.120> doesn't<00:03:47.389> it<00:03:47.480> just<00:03:47.569> doesn't<00:03:47.840> look

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
and it doesn't it just doesn't look

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.599 
and it doesn't it just doesn't look
right<00:03:47.989> for<00:03:48.260> pencil<00:03:48.530> skirt<00:03:48.709> I<00:03:48.769> think<00:03:48.980> it<00:03:49.430> looks

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
right for pencil skirt I think it looks

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:50.949 
right for pencil skirt I think it looks
really<00:03:49.790> nice<00:03:49.970> right<00:03:50.120> by<00:03:50.450> the<00:03:50.510> knee<00:03:50.750> right

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
really nice right by the knee right

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.080 
really nice right by the knee right
