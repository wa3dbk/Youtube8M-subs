i'm<00:00:17.880> using<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:18.420> crappy<00:00:18.660> computer<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.350> do<00:00:19.470> this

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
i'm using a crappy computer to do this

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.769 
i'm using a crappy computer to do this
but<00:00:19.859> there's<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.250> Dark<00:00:20.460> Portal<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.390> new<00:00:21.539> one

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
but there's the Dark Portal the new one

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.380 
but there's the Dark Portal the new one
and<00:00:21.960> it's<00:00:22.199> absolutely<00:00:22.800> huge<00:00:23.210> I'm<00:00:24.210> not<00:00:24.330> sure

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
and it's absolutely huge I'm not sure

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.839 
and it's absolutely huge I'm not sure
how<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.720> get<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.140> level<00:00:25.410> 100<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:26.250> think<00:00:26.760> the

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
how to get to level 100 I think the

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.609 
how to get to level 100 I think the
servers<00:00:27.240> down<00:00:27.390> or<00:00:27.599> something<00:00:27.810> like<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:27.960> but

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
servers down or something like that but

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.620 
servers down or something like that but
let's<00:00:28.949> have<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.130> look<00:00:29.340> at<00:00:29.460> all<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.910> new<00:00:30.090> UI<00:00:30.300> we

versatility<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.420> then<00:01:36.840> we<00:01:36.930> have<00:01:37.049> avoidance

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
versatility and then we have avoidance

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.800 
versatility and then we have avoidance
that<00:01:38.070> reduces<00:01:38.759> damage<00:01:38.880> from<00:01:39.180> AoE<00:01:39.420> seems
