00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.109
 what expectation for these 200 parties 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.109
 that remain mostly on Sundays 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:22.960
 the three points and it's the key moment and 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.960
 Now I think it's a nice match 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.920
 the only tournament 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.920
 How nice would that joke be? 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:46.269
 we know that as a team 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.079
 If so, but we also think 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.079
 that the cutest 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.670
 naturalness with medicines 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:18.530
 I think that if you use analyzed in the 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.090
 party before which through these 25 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.640
 minutes 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.350
 we had the ball up here we go and 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.280
 then only now is it 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:31.400
 complicated now by the subject of the sun 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.940
 not much and then we also started to 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.840
 look for the match 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.840
 after winning so much 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.850
 so they take a chance when it comes to winning 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.280
 now they gained more risk things and they are 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.280
 things that we have to improve because 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:58.540
 you know there was a big team and 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:01.150
 that you have to attack but there are moments 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.920
 where we have to be suddenly more 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.140
 concentrated or more grouped so that 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.560
 we stop again but if we are young 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.560
 what 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.470
 as you say are things that there are 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.920
 to be more attentive obviously you 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.830
 they know that when one goes out to propose 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.230
 stops risks to be transmitted and one of 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.790
 leaders who can make you flat 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.560
 a goal to unite anyway for me 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.210
 it turns out they are going to be left because 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.460
 we need the three points for a great 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.410
 result but it 's a silver simply 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.880
 difficult where there was a lot of height for the 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.740
 home the cannes programmed well 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.590
 scheduled later that would have been 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:43.170
 different the game and well I think that 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.380
 so much if we were in fact a blow 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.780
 in a first time of the match of 5 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.000
 but good things would be and we 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.340
 we have to be calm about our 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.020
 work we know that the team is 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.340
 running pretty that is going out to 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.340
 propose everywhere and you want 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.520
 yes obviously but but that is part 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.980
 of all 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.000
 that there are things to improve if that is not 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.940
 what to improve 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.090
 and obviously we do not like that the 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:21.660
 alcohol is like that on kickbacks but 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.080
 I tell you do not risk always and part of 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.940
 the risks that remain spaces in 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.459
 Bogota at that time 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.800
 many times good then to leave if you 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:35.430
 It costs a little more to return 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:37.379
 then there are things that if I say that 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.450
 like everything I say, you have to improve 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:40.930
 but but it also did not work like a big 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.969
 problem 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.340
 We've been playing pretty well we 

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:47.590
 got great results that out there 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.239
 we have been able to win here and playing 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.090
 pretty good out there is what has 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.829
 hurt and you have to start now 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.379
 that comes not to stay in things and 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:58.000
 know that the party match have to 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:00.389
 you have to win so you are world this 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.389
 content 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:09.880
 I really think it's pretty good 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.880
 that the team 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.319
 last letter is that we will have 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.780
 closed but more against a team that 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.820
 he needs to win and I'm going to make a game 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.470
 round trip where we also 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.710
 find spaces and we have to be 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.120
 smart 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:28.630
 and it's going to be a nice match 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:31.330
 us winning I think the energy 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.250
 is going to be very big is my mind split 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.100
 it's a party that does not always want 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:40.380
 play and that in it also has 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.380
 great players but for us
