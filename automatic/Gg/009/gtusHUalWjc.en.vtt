00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
now this is time I have here I think the

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.630 
now this is time I have here I think the
way<00:00:20.760> I<00:00:20.789> did<00:00:21.029> it<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.270> pretty<00:00:21.570> original<00:00:22.020> for<00:00:22.170> Xbox

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
way I did it is pretty original for Xbox

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.689 
way I did it is pretty original for Xbox
but<00:00:23.640> there's<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.330> lot<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.539> flaws<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:25.949> guess<00:00:26.519> to

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
but there's a lot of flaws I guess to

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.269 
but there's a lot of flaws I guess to
was<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.880> lot<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.210> ways<00:00:27.480> around<00:00:27.769> the<00:00:28.769> system<00:00:29.010> i

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
was a lot of ways around the system i

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.260 
was a lot of ways around the system i
have<00:00:29.689> now<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:30.720> did<00:00:31.260> like<00:00:32.040> this<00:00:32.219> entire<00:00:32.550> time<00:00:32.820> I

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
been trying to figure out ways to do

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.400 
been trying to figure out ways to do
that<00:00:36.809> with<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.500> new<00:00:38.360> stacking<00:00:39.360> items<00:00:39.719> but<00:00:40.110> the

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
that with the new stacking items but the

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.440 
that with the new stacking items but the
build<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.129> redstone<00:00:41.610> just<00:00:41.879> became<00:00:42.180> so

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
build and the redstone just became so

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.190 
build and the redstone just became so
massive<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.950> complicated<00:00:44.780> it<00:00:45.780> wasn't<00:00:46.110> even

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
massive so complicated it wasn't even

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.549 
massive so complicated it wasn't even
worth<00:00:46.350> doing<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.579> so<00:00:48.079> when<00:00:49.079> I'm<00:00:49.200> finished<00:00:49.379> with

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
worth doing it so when I'm finished with

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.990 
worth doing it so when I'm finished with
this<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:50.250> you're<00:00:50.399> going<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.550> be<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.760> probably

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
reinforced pick X with unbreaking was

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.790 
reinforced pick X with unbreaking was
that<00:02:50.940> five<00:02:51.540> six<00:02:52.080> rings<00:02:52.680> for<00:02:53.280> unbreaking<00:02:54.030> eight

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
that five six rings for unbreaking eight

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:01.160 
that five six rings for unbreaking eight
so<00:02:55.800> that's<00:02:55.950> reinforced<00:02:56.250> pickaxe<00:02:57.020> I<00:02:59.450> have<00:03:00.450> this

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
so that's reinforced pickaxe I have this

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.900 
so that's reinforced pickaxe I have this
reinforced<00:03:01.920> stick<00:03:02.490> or<00:03:02.640> whatever<00:03:02.820> with

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
unbreaking just so you could tell the

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.050 
unbreaking just so you could tell the
difference<00:03:04.200> between<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:05.310> reinforced<00:03:05.850> steak

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
difference between the reinforced steak

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.580 
difference between the reinforced steak
and<00:03:06.270> a<00:03:06.330> regular<00:03:06.750> stick<00:03:07.020> although<00:03:07.440> i'm<00:03:07.560> not

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
sure if they do stack on top of one

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.560 
sure if they do stack on top of one
another<00:03:10.370> when<00:03:11.370> you're<00:03:11.490> in<00:03:11.580> survival<00:03:11.760> but<00:03:12.330> i

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
another when you're in survival but i

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.830 
another when you're in survival but i
don't<00:03:13.470> think<00:03:13.650> they<00:03:13.740> do<00:03:13.800> so<00:03:14.310> anyways<00:03:14.790> on<00:03:15.030> the

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
don't think they do so anyways on the

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.560 
don't think they do so anyways on the
other<00:03:16.020> another<00:03:16.800> flaw<00:03:17.400> or<00:03:17.790> why<00:03:18.209> you<00:03:18.270> can<00:03:18.450> get

other another flaw or why you can get
around<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:18.840> system<00:03:18.989> is<00:03:19.290> you<00:03:19.380> could<00:03:19.500> just

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
around the system is you could just

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.080 
around the system is you could just
straight<00:03:20.250> up<00:03:20.280> just<00:03:20.550> come<00:03:20.700> in<00:03:20.850> here<00:03:20.880> and

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
straight up just come in here and

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.140 
straight up just come in here and
survival<00:03:21.720> in<00:03:21.840> mine<00:03:22.410> all<00:03:22.709> of<00:03:22.739> these<00:03:23.070> of<00:03:23.340> these

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
survival in mine all of these of these

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.330 
survival in mine all of these of these
item<00:03:24.540> frames<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:25.080> just<00:03:25.410> get<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.770> items<00:03:26.160> out

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.910 
item frames and just get the items out
of<00:03:26.370> it<00:03:26.610> so<00:03:26.850> it's<00:03:27.600> it<00:03:27.989> i<00:03:28.290> mean<00:03:28.410> there's<00:03:28.620> many

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
of it so it's it i mean there's many

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.410 
of it so it's it i mean there's many
ways<00:03:29.100> around<00:03:29.280> it<00:03:29.580> but<00:03:29.760> like<00:03:29.880> i<00:03:30.000> said<00:03:30.030> it's<00:03:30.360> just

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
ways around it but like i said it's just

going<00:03:42.660> to<00:03:42.720> be<00:03:42.810> a<00:03:42.900> zombie<00:03:43.140> head<00:03:43.500> because<00:03:44.010> you

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
going to be a zombie head because you

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.340 
going to be a zombie head because you
can't<00:03:44.370> actually<00:03:44.489> get<00:03:44.760> them<00:03:44.910> in<00:03:45.060> game<00:03:45.270> and<00:03:45.540> what

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
can't actually get them in game and what

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.570 
can't actually get them in game and what
I<00:03:46.380> was<00:03:46.530> thinking<00:03:46.800> to<00:03:46.920> do<00:03:47.070> was<00:03:47.220> I<00:03:47.310> would<00:03:47.430> use

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
I was thinking to do was I would use

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.940 
I was thinking to do was I would use
like<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:47.970> zombie<00:03:48.360> head<00:03:48.630> so<00:03:49.530> you<00:03:49.560> had<00:03:49.739> to<00:03:49.860> like

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
like the zombie head so you had to like

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.420 
like the zombie head so you had to like
crabs<00:03:50.580> you<00:03:50.760> had<00:03:50.850> to<00:03:50.910> put<00:03:51.090> a<00:03:51.270> pumpkin<00:03:51.810> head<00:03:51.840> and

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
crabs you had to put a pumpkin head and

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.550 
crabs you had to put a pumpkin head and
one<00:03:53.430> green<00:03:53.910> bowl<00:03:54.209> block<00:03:54.480> actually<00:03:55.260> would

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
one green bowl block actually would

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.180 
one green bowl block actually would
spring<00:03:55.770> up<00:03:55.830> to<00:03:55.950> my<00:03:56.070> cart<00:03:57.590> you<00:03:58.590> would<00:03:58.770> put<00:03:59.040> those

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
spring up to my cart you would put those

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.760 
spring up to my cart you would put those
two<00:03:59.459> items<00:03:59.610> in<00:03:59.970> push<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:00.690> button<00:04:01.020> to<00:04:01.440> send<00:04:01.590> off

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
two items in push the button to send off

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.680 
two items in push the button to send off
no<00:04:02.250> one<00:04:02.370> would<00:04:02.459> come<00:04:02.580> in<00:04:02.820> and<00:04:03.060> I<00:04:03.330> would<00:04:03.480> get<00:04:03.660> a

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
no one would come in and I would get a

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.930 
no one would come in and I would get a
zombie<00:04:04.080> head<00:04:04.230> now<00:04:04.950> I<00:04:04.980> was<00:04:05.220> thinking<00:04:05.580> like<00:04:05.730> yeah

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
zombie head now I was thinking like yeah

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.250 
zombie head now I was thinking like yeah
you<00:04:06.000> could<00:04:06.270> place<00:04:06.630> it<00:04:06.660> down<00:04:06.870> or<00:04:07.080> do<00:04:07.170> whatever

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
you could place it down or do whatever

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.040 
you could place it down or do whatever
you<00:04:07.500> want<00:04:07.709> with<00:04:07.770> it<00:04:07.860> or<00:04:08.760> I<00:04:09.330> was<00:04:09.660> thinking<00:04:09.930> it's

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
you want with it or I was thinking it's

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.810 
you want with it or I was thinking it's
going<00:04:10.140> to<00:04:10.200> have<00:04:10.320> another<00:04:10.590> like<00:04:10.980> recipe<00:04:11.550> that

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
going to have another like recipe that

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.160 
going to have another like recipe that
would<00:04:11.970> you<00:04:12.120> have<00:04:12.209> to<00:04:12.300> use<00:04:12.450> like<00:04:12.630> the<00:04:12.810> zombie

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
would you have to use like the zombie

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.830 
would you have to use like the zombie
head<00:04:13.380> and<00:04:13.739> the<00:04:14.610> skeleton<00:04:14.910> head<00:04:15.330> or<00:04:15.600> something

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
head and the skeleton head or something

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.080 
head and the skeleton head or something
and<00:04:16.200> then<00:04:16.380> that'll<00:04:16.859> get<00:04:17.010> you<00:04:17.190> something<00:04:17.940> else

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
and then that'll get you something else

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.180 
and then that'll get you something else
or<00:04:18.419> I<00:04:18.600> don't<00:04:18.810> I<00:04:19.019> don't<00:04:19.049> know<00:04:19.320> I<00:04:19.530> haven't<00:04:19.950> really

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
or I don't I don't know I haven't really

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.340 
or I don't I don't know I haven't really
developed<00:04:20.310> it<00:04:20.669> yet<00:04:20.880> but<00:04:21.180> there's<00:04:22.140> something

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
developed it yet but there's something

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.190 
developed it yet but there's something
cool<00:04:22.620> that<00:04:22.680> would<00:04:23.039> be<00:04:23.190> neat

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
cool that would be neat

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.780 
cool that would be neat
I<00:04:24.320> have<00:04:24.680> fun<00:04:24.890> anything<00:04:25.190> here<00:04:25.400> but<00:04:25.550> you<00:04:25.670> could

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
I have fun anything here but you could

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:26.830 
I have fun anything here but you could
see<00:04:25.940> that<00:04:26.060> I<00:04:26.150> could<00:04:26.330> just<00:04:26.480> set<00:04:26.660> up<00:04:26.750> the

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
see that I could just set up the

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.690 
see that I could just set up the
redstone<00:04:27.260> so<00:04:27.890> you're<00:04:28.370> probably<00:04:28.460> wondering

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
redstone so you're probably wondering

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:34.110 
redstone so you're probably wondering
how<00:04:28.970> this<00:04:29.120> works<00:04:31.600> it's<00:04:32.600> actually<00:04:32.720> very<00:04:32.930> simple

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
how this works it's actually very simple

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.430 
how this works it's actually very simple
down<00:04:35.120> here<00:04:35.390> when<00:04:35.510> you<00:04:35.570> push<00:04:35.720> the<00:04:35.870> button<00:04:35.900> this

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
down here when you push the button this

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.700 
down here when you push the button this
redstone<00:04:36.860> goes<00:04:37.160> off<00:04:37.370> and<00:04:37.670> i<00:04:38.270> have<00:04:38.450> just<00:04:38.660> my<00:04:39.470> car

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
redstone goes off and i have just my car

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.070 
redstone goes off and i have just my car
with<00:04:39.860> chest<00:04:40.130> i<00:04:40.280> modded<00:04:40.640> it<00:04:40.760> so<00:04:41.180> it's<00:04:41.870> going<00:04:42.020> to

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
with chest i modded it so it's going to

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.640 
with chest i modded it so it's going to
be<00:04:42.790> 576<00:04:43.790> i<00:04:43.910> think<00:04:44.090> it<00:04:44.180> is<00:04:44.300> chests<00:04:45.020> or<00:04:45.200> my<00:04:45.380> card

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
be 576 i think it is chests or my card

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.400 
be 576 i think it is chests or my card
chests<00:04:46.070> so<00:04:46.760> you<00:04:47.330> actually<00:04:47.540> can<00:04:47.930> technically

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
chests so you actually can technically

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.150 
chests so you actually can technically
run<00:04:48.680> out<00:04:48.860> of<00:04:49.120> modded<00:04:50.120> items<00:04:50.450> but<00:04:51.110> i'm<00:04:51.710> hoping

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
run out of modded items but i'm hoping

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.700 
run out of modded items but i'm hoping
that<00:04:52.640> i<00:04:53.300> mean<00:04:54.110> this<00:04:54.200> is<00:04:54.320> really<00:04:54.380> the<00:04:54.590> matter

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
that i mean this is really the matter

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.200 
that i mean this is really the matter
you<00:04:54.890> can<00:04:55.040> get<00:04:55.190> doesn't<00:04:55.550> even<00:04:55.700> matter<00:04:55.880> but<00:04:56.120> i'm

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
you can get doesn't even matter but i'm

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.630 
you can get doesn't even matter but i'm
hoping<00:04:56.330> nobody<00:04:56.660> actually<00:04:57.590> runs<00:04:58.010> out<00:04:58.220> because

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
hoping nobody actually runs out because

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.610 
hoping nobody actually runs out because
there's<00:04:58.760> not<00:04:58.850> much<00:04:59.030> i<00:04:59.150> can<00:04:59.180> do<00:04:59.450> at<00:04:59.750> all<00:04:59.930> so

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
there's not much i can do at all so

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.490 
there's not much i can do at all so
that's<00:05:01.580> this<00:05:01.810> that<00:05:02.810> was<00:05:02.900> pretty<00:05:03.080> cool<00:05:03.260> i<00:05:03.350> like

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
that's this that was pretty cool i like

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.650 
that's this that was pretty cool i like
i<00:05:03.710> modded<00:05:04.160> that<00:05:04.280> so<00:05:04.490> it's<00:05:04.640> stacked<00:05:05.000> in<00:05:05.270> there

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
i modded that so it's stacked in there

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.990 
i modded that so it's stacked in there
and<00:05:05.870> then<00:05:06.650> all<00:05:06.980> you<00:05:07.070> do<00:05:07.190> is<00:05:07.400> when<00:05:07.550> you<00:05:07.640> push<00:05:07.820> the

to it so it's just get a button push
this<00:05:21.590> you<00:05:21.920> can<00:05:22.040> see<00:05:22.160> it<00:05:22.280> goes<00:05:22.400> up<00:05:22.580> comes<00:05:23.450> up<00:05:23.720> and

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
this you can see it goes up comes up and

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.610 
this you can see it goes up comes up and
then<00:05:24.110> it<00:05:24.260> goes<00:05:24.470> in<00:05:24.740> here<00:05:25.160> which<00:05:26.030> is<00:05:26.410> actually<00:05:27.410> I

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
then it goes in here which is actually I

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:28.720 
then it goes in here which is actually I
think<00:05:27.680> they're<00:05:27.890> ready<00:05:27.920> wasn't<00:05:28.310> my<00:05:28.370> card<00:05:28.640> in

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:28.730 
think they're ready wasn't my card in

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.040 
think they're ready wasn't my card in
there<00:05:28.880> so<00:05:29.000> I<00:05:29.030> think<00:05:29.150> I<00:05:29.330> might<00:05:29.780> have<00:05:29.810> just

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
there so I think I might have just

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.310 
there so I think I might have just
broken<00:05:30.320> that<00:05:31.030> nope<00:05:32.030> I<00:05:32.180> didn't<00:05:32.450> alright<00:05:32.690> so

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
broken that nope I didn't alright so

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.250 
broken that nope I didn't alright so

yeah the mine cart goes up here glitches
through<00:05:36.410> the<00:05:36.500> block<00:05:36.740> stops<00:05:37.280> here<00:05:37.720> goes<00:05:38.720> back

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
through the block stops here goes back

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.060 
through the block stops here goes back
up<00:05:38.990> and<00:05:39.440> into<00:05:40.570> this<00:05:41.570> little<00:05:41.920> compartment<00:05:42.920> here

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:50.480 
here underneath that that's a powered

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.210 
here underneath that that's a powered
rail<00:05:50.690> let's<00:05:51.350> get<00:05:51.500> rid<00:05:51.590> of<00:05:51.620> these<00:05:51.710> blocks<00:05:51.980> there

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
it'll go up through this block back down

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.100 
it'll go up through this block back down
over<00:05:57.230> this<00:05:57.320> detector<00:05:57.830> rail<00:05:58.040> which<00:05:58.640> triggers

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
over this detector rail which triggers

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.200 
over this detector rail which triggers
these<00:06:00.110> torches<00:06:00.500> that<00:06:00.830> go<00:06:00.980> into<00:06:01.160> this<00:06:01.790> which

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210 
these torches that go into this which

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.500 
these torches that go into this which
dispenses<00:06:02.870> a<00:06:02.930> unbreaking<00:06:03.860> steak<00:06:04.310> and<00:06:04.550> then

dispenses a unbreaking steak and then

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.800 
dispenses a unbreaking steak and then
the<00:06:05.930> my<00:06:06.050> card<00:06:06.350> just<00:06:06.380> goes<00:06:06.680> into<00:06:06.980> the<00:06:07.070> lava<00:06:07.250> so

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
the my card just goes into the lava so

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.740 
the my card just goes into the lava so
it's<00:06:08.810> pretty<00:06:08.930> simple<00:06:10.240> because<00:06:11.240> it<00:06:11.420> then<00:06:11.600> it

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:11.750 
it's pretty simple because it then it

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.090 
it's pretty simple because it then it
just<00:06:11.870> gets<00:06:11.990> destroyed<00:06:12.350> in<00:06:12.470> a<00:06:12.530> lava<00:06:12.740> and

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:13.100 
just gets destroyed in a lava and

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.440 
just gets destroyed in a lava and
everything<00:06:13.610> is<00:06:13.670> just<00:06:13.700> broken<00:06:14.000> you<00:06:14.180> could<00:06:14.300> just

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:14.450 
everything is just broken you could just

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.990 
everything is just broken you could just
see<00:06:15.200> if<00:06:15.590> this<00:06:15.740> falls<00:06:15.950> in<00:06:16.100> love<00:06:16.250> and<00:06:16.490> disappears

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 
see if this falls in love and disappears

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.200 
see if this falls in love and disappears
and<00:06:17.180> destroys<00:06:17.510> everything<00:06:17.750> that's<00:06:17.960> in<00:06:18.050> it<00:06:18.140> so

the<00:06:22.760> world<00:06:23.060> obviously<00:06:23.300> is<00:06:23.630> like<00:06:23.780> this<00:06:24.020> is<00:06:24.170> just

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:24.200 
the world obviously is like this is just

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.740 
the world obviously is like this is just
the<00:06:24.470> beginning<00:06:24.590> of<00:06:25.070> the<00:06:25.220> modded<00:06:25.610> survival<00:06:26.210> is

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:26.750 
the beginning of the modded survival is

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.650 
the beginning of the modded survival is
are<00:06:26.870> considered<00:06:27.380> like<00:06:27.560> the<00:06:27.710> modded<00:06:28.070> recipes

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:28.660 
are considered like the modded recipes

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:33.040 
are considered like the modded recipes
and<00:06:29.660> you<00:06:29.780> would<00:06:29.900> get<00:06:30.050> with<00:06:30.170> the<00:06:30.290> mod<00:06:30.470> and<00:06:32.050> with

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.050 
and you would get with the mod and with

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.820 
and you would get with the mod and with
that<00:06:34.000> what<00:06:35.000> this<00:06:35.150> would<00:06:35.330> just<00:06:35.450> be<00:06:35.570> like<00:06:35.750> in<00:06:36.320> the

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:36.830 
that what this would just be like in the

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:37.870 
that what this would just be like in the
spawn<00:06:37.130> like<00:06:37.400> actually

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:37.880 
spawn like actually

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.790 
spawn like actually
kind<00:06:38.000> of<00:06:38.060> have<00:06:38.210> it<00:06:38.300> set<00:06:38.450> up<00:06:38.480> here<00:06:38.750> you<00:06:39.500> can<00:06:39.650> see

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800 
kind of have it set up here you can see

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.260 
kind of have it set up here you can see
these<00:06:39.950> rewards<00:06:40.130> this<00:06:40.610> would<00:06:40.820> be<00:06:40.910> where<00:06:41.090> it's

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:41.270 
these rewards this would be where it's

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.480 
these rewards this would be where it's
set<00:06:41.480> up<00:06:41.510> this<00:06:41.960> would<00:06:42.140> be<00:06:42.230> the<00:06:42.350> spawn<00:06:42.650> I'd<00:06:43.130> have

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:43.490 
set up this would be the spawn I'd have

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.460 
set up this would be the spawn I'd have
multiple<00:06:44.120> floors<00:06:44.390> of<00:06:44.690> it<00:06:44.840> I'm<00:06:44.990> probably<00:06:45.080> make

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:45.470 
multiple floors of it I'm probably make

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.550 
multiple floors of it I'm probably make
it<00:06:45.620> bigger<00:06:46.040> and<00:06:46.190> all<00:06:46.430> that<00:06:46.960> each<00:06:47.960> floor<00:06:48.290> can

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.560 
it bigger and all that each floor can

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.450 
it bigger and all that each floor can
hold<00:06:48.710> eight<00:06:49.100> recipes<00:06:49.790> and<00:06:49.940> all<00:06:50.000> that<00:06:50.180> so<00:06:51.460> all

all<00:07:41.570> made<00:07:41.720> out<00:07:41.840> of<00:07:41.870> bedrock<00:07:42.290> is<00:07:42.910> I<00:07:43.910> don't<00:07:44.900> know

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:45.050 
all made out of bedrock is I don't know

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:46.390 
all made out of bedrock is I don't know
I<00:07:45.140> guess<00:07:45.260> just<00:07:45.560> I'm<00:07:45.830> not<00:07:45.980> going<00:07:46.100> to<00:07:46.160> get<00:07:46.280> out<00:07:46.340> of

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:46.400 
I guess just I'm not going to get out of

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.860 
I guess just I'm not going to get out of
iron<00:07:46.670> blocks<00:07:47.120> because<00:07:47.330> then<00:07:47.510> you<00:07:47.630> could<00:07:47.750> just

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:47.870 
iron blocks because then you could just

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:49.870 
iron blocks because then you could just
hoard<00:07:48.140> all<00:07:48.260> the<00:07:48.440> iron<00:07:48.680> so<00:07:49.340> i<00:07:49.370> guess<00:07:49.610> it<00:07:49.850> was

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:49.880 
hoard all the iron so i guess it was

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.210 
hoard all the iron so i guess it was
more<00:07:50.360> of<00:07:50.390> for<00:07:51.170> the<00:07:51.230> people<00:07:51.590> that<00:07:51.740> are<00:07:51.770> going<00:07:52.100> to
