00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
as you saw so yeah there's the bike path

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.990 
as you saw so yeah there's the bike path
easy<00:02:37.760> as<00:02:38.060> helping<00:02:38.420> me<00:02:38.540> pretty<00:02:39.500> sturdy

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
easy as helping me pretty sturdy

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.250 
easy as helping me pretty sturdy
actually<00:02:41.000> held<00:02:41.180> up<00:02:41.300> pretty<00:02:41.570> good<00:02:41.660> when<00:02:42.020> I<00:02:42.050> was

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
actually held up pretty good when I was

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.580 
actually held up pretty good when I was
uh<00:02:42.850> like<00:02:43.850> there's<00:02:44.420> no<00:02:44.570> snow<00:02:44.840> outside<00:02:45.019> yet<00:02:45.410> but

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
uh like there's no snow outside yet but

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:46.990 
uh like there's no snow outside yet but
I'm<00:02:45.709> getting<00:02:45.830> prepared<00:02:46.250> people<00:02:46.550> I'm<00:02:46.760> getting

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
I'm getting prepared people I'm getting

00:02:47.000 --> 00:03:43.190 
I'm getting prepared people I'm getting
prepared<00:02:47.150> so<00:02:51.940> so<00:02:52.940> I'm<00:02:53.239> getting<00:02:53.540> prepared

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.900 

the<00:03:44.200> idea<00:03:44.530> is<00:03:44.680> to<00:03:44.740> basically<00:03:45.010> keep<00:03:45.490> this<00:03:45.640> ring

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
the idea is to basically keep this ring

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.770 
the idea is to basically keep this ring
on<00:03:46.720> there<00:03:47.260> at<00:03:47.440> all<00:03:47.530> times<00:03:48.180> so<00:03:49.180> we'll<00:03:49.450> have<00:03:49.540> more

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
on there at all times so we'll have more

00:03:49.780 --> 00:05:54.490 
on there at all times so we'll have more
on<00:03:49.840> that<00:03:52.290> under<00:03:53.290> the<00:03:53.410> tire<00:04:30.060> I<00:04:31.060> don't<00:04:31.330> know<00:04:31.510> why

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:03.700 

you<00:05:55.500> do<00:05:55.650> that<00:05:55.800> process<00:05:56.009> but<00:05:56.340> backwards<00:06:00.139> easy

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.749 

put<00:06:04.710> it<00:06:04.800> outside<00:06:04.889> put<00:06:05.340> it<00:06:05.430> in<00:06:05.490> the<00:06:05.580> basement

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:05.759 
put it outside put it in the basement

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:09.469 
put it outside put it in the basement
put<00:06:06.330> it<00:06:06.419> in<00:06:06.509> your<00:06:06.599> garage<00:06:08.150> anywhere<00:06:09.150> will<00:06:09.300> work

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 
put it in your garage anywhere will work

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:13.850 
put it in your garage anywhere will work
I<00:06:10.160> guess<00:06:11.449> yeah<00:06:12.449> building<00:06:12.810> for<00:06:13.320> yourself<00:06:13.680> man

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
I guess yeah building for yourself man

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.480 
I guess yeah building for yourself man
it's<00:06:14.310> good<00:06:14.520> idea<00:06:15.860> we'll<00:06:16.860> get<00:06:16.979> a<00:06:17.009> video<00:06:17.250> going

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490 
it's good idea we'll get a video going

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.040 
it's good idea we'll get a video going
