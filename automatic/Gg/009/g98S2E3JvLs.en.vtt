the design but I'm cool with it now
probably<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:51.990> one<00:02:52.170> downside<00:02:52.860> on<00:02:52.920> this<00:02:53.250> figure

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
probably the one downside on this figure

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.680 
probably the one downside on this figure
is<00:02:53.880> as<00:02:54.390> nice<00:02:54.660> as<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.110> boots<00:02:55.320> are<00:02:55.700> I<00:02:56.700> really

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
is as nice as the boots are I really

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.810 
is as nice as the boots are I really
don't<00:02:57.840> care<00:02:58.110> for<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.380> yellow<00:02:58.950> instead<00:02:59.430> of

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
don't care for the yellow instead of

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.330 
don't care for the yellow instead of
gold<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:00.480> thought<00:03:01.350> that<00:03:01.410> was<00:03:01.620> somewhat<00:03:02.130> of<00:03:02.250> a

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
gold I thought that was somewhat of a

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.420 
gold I thought that was somewhat of a
mistake<00:03:02.730> but<00:03:03.050> if<00:03:04.050> you<00:03:04.350> go<00:03:04.500> back<00:03:04.710> on<00:03:04.920> older

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
mistake but if you go back on older

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.880 
mistake but if you go back on older
albertos<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.660> detailing<00:03:07.170> on<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.560> white

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
albertos the detailing on the white

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.830 
albertos the detailing on the white
boots<00:03:08.220> was<00:03:08.580> yellow<00:03:08.940> too<00:03:09.000> so<00:03:09.600> it<00:03:09.810> does<00:03:11.600> max<00:03:12.600> up

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
boots was yellow too so it does max up

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.860 
boots was yellow too so it does max up
with<00:03:13.050> other<00:03:13.550> alberto's<00:03:14.550> but<00:03:15.000> i<00:03:15.240> still<00:03:15.450> think<00:03:15.690> a

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
with other alberto's but i still think a

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.810 
with other alberto's but i still think a
gold<00:03:16.590> plastic<00:03:17.510> will<00:03:18.510> look<00:03:18.660> much<00:03:18.870> better<00:03:19.820> but

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
gold plastic will look much better but

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.050 
gold plastic will look much better but
