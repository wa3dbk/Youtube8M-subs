not<00:01:33.180> knowing<00:01:33.420> how<00:01:33.570> much<00:01:33.690> they'll<00:01:33.840> go<00:01:33.990> for<00:01:34.290> it

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
not knowing how much they'll go for it

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.680 
not knowing how much they'll go for it
was<00:01:34.590> just<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:34.920> easy<00:01:35.159> but<00:01:35.460> now<00:01:35.700> as<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.510> can<00:01:36.630> see

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
was just so easy but now as you can see

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.060 
was just so easy but now as you can see
in<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.900> background<00:01:36.930> none<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.560> them<00:01:37.710> even<00:01:37.830> go

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
in the background none of them even go

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.340 
in the background none of them even go
through<00:01:38.220> 200<00:01:38.610> coins<00:01:38.760> one<00:01:39.150> went<00:01:39.510> fallout<00:01:39.840> 150

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
through 200 coins one went fallout 150

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.960 
through 200 coins one went fallout 150
start<00:01:40.620> by<00:01:40.799> spit<00:01:41.100> that's<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.580> rest<00:01:41.610> didn't

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
start by spit that's it the rest didn't

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.700 
start by spit that's it the rest didn't
even<00:01:42.150> go<00:01:42.270> for<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.600> so<00:01:43.290> they've<00:01:43.440> all<00:01:43.590> gone

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
even go for that so they've all gone

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.590 
even go for that so they've all gone
down<00:01:43.950> but<00:01:44.190> that<00:01:44.430> was<00:01:44.580> so<00:01:44.790> easy<00:01:44.940> to<00:01:45.119> treat<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:45.450> as

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
down but that was so easy to treat it as

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.660 
down but that was so easy to treat it as
well<00:01:45.750> as<00:01:45.900> a<00:01:45.930> big<00:01:46.170> boost<00:01:46.380> but<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:46.920> think<00:01:47.549> people

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
well as a big boost but I think people

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.399 
well as a big boost but I think people
caught<00:01:47.940> on<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.299> so<00:01:48.600> now<00:01:48.750> it's<00:01:48.900> not<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.080> good

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
caught on to it so now it's not so good

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.770 
caught on to it so now it's not so good
so<00:01:49.979> Indian<00:01:50.369> really<00:01:50.760> i<00:01:50.790> just<00:01:50.850> i<00:01:51.210> brought<00:01:51.600> him
