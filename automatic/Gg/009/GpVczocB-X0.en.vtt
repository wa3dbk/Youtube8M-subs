Stefan's from the vampire days if you

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.950 
Stefan's from the vampire days if you
didn't<00:04:59.580> know<00:04:59.699> ketchup<00:05:00.270> come<00:05:00.449> on<00:05:00.630> get<00:05:00.810> with<00:05:00.840> it

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
didn't know ketchup come on get with it

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.340 
didn't know ketchup come on get with it
and<00:05:01.410> day<00:05:02.040> from<00:05:02.100> The<00:05:02.699> Legend<00:05:03.090> series<00:05:03.300> all<00:05:03.810> day

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.430 
so I think that before she have it off
the<00:05:05.820> clip<00:05:06.090> not<00:05:06.479> doing<00:05:06.810> much<00:05:06.930> to<00:05:07.110> em<00:05:07.260> it
