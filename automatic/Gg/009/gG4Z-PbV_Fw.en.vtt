why<00:00:00.329> what's<00:00:00.690> this<00:00:00.900> well<00:00:01.319> we're<00:00:01.500> trying<00:00:01.650> how<00:00:01.920> to

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
why what's this well we're trying how to

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.880 
why what's this well we're trying how to
use<00:00:02.429> a<00:00:02.540> source<00:00:03.540> of<00:00:03.750> energy<00:00:03.929> that's<00:00:04.290> 93<00:00:04.710> million

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
use a source of energy that's 93 million

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.320 
use a source of energy that's 93 million
miles<00:00:05.100> away<00:00:05.250> you<00:00:05.460> might<00:00:05.609> think<00:00:05.850> of<00:00:05.940> this<00:00:06.060> as<00:00:06.120> a

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
miles away you might think of this as a

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.750 
miles away you might think of this as a
nuclear<00:00:07.250> station<00:00:08.250> for<00:00:08.429> producing

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
nuclear station for producing

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.250 
nuclear station for producing
electricity<00:00:09.090> that's<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:09.780> world's<00:00:10.080> most

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
electricity that's the world's most

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.589 
electricity that's the world's most
efficient<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:10.920> what<00:00:11.849> we're<00:00:12.000> going<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:12.179> do<00:00:12.360> is

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
efficient and what we're going to do is

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.259 
efficient and what we're going to do is
to<00:00:12.690> take<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.410> rays<00:00:13.620> of<00:00:13.830> solar<00:00:14.070> energy<00:00:14.309> from<00:00:14.880> a

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
to take the rays of solar energy from a

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.790 
to take the rays of solar energy from a
fusion<00:00:16.049> reactor<00:00:16.580> which<00:00:17.580> is<00:00:17.609> our<00:00:17.850> Sun<00:00:18.090> and

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
fusion reactor which is our Sun and

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.050

concentrate<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:20.010> radiant<00:00:20.430> energy<00:00:20.550> right

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
concentrate that radiant energy right

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.140 
concentrate that radiant energy right
here<00:00:21.090> in<00:00:21.420> this<00:00:21.510> small<00:00:21.660> area<00:00:22.050> which<00:00:22.260> is<00:00:22.439> then<00:00:22.859> a

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
here in this small area which is then a

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.820 
here in this small area which is then a
hydrogen<00:00:24.150> heater<00:00:24.510> inside<00:00:24.990> this<00:00:25.230> as<00:00:25.500> hydrogen

hydrogen heater inside this as hydrogen

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.370 
hydrogen heater inside this as hydrogen
is<00:00:26.189> heated<00:00:26.519> rapidly<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.240> then<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:28.050> is<00:00:28.199> also

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
is heated rapidly and then it is also

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.080 
is heated rapidly and then it is also
cooled<00:00:28.980> rapidly<00:00:29.189> so<00:00:29.580> we're<00:00:29.730> showing<00:00:29.939> the

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
cooled rapidly so we're showing the

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.450 
cooled rapidly so we're showing the
ability<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.510> hydrogen<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.019> rapidly<00:00:31.380> be<00:00:32.130> heated

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
ability of hydrogen to rapidly be heated

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.280 
ability of hydrogen to rapidly be heated
and<00:00:32.640> cooled<00:00:32.880> as<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:33.630> operates<00:00:33.750> as<00:00:34.170> an

refrigeration unit it can be a generator

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.760 
refrigeration unit it can be a generator
but<00:00:45.539> this<00:00:45.660> holds<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.020> world's<00:00:46.289> record<00:00:46.410> for

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
but this holds the world's record for

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.160 
but this holds the world's record for
converting<00:00:47.399> solar<00:00:47.640> energy<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.539> an<00:00:48.899> amount

converting solar energy in an amount

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.540 
converting solar energy in an amount
that's<00:00:49.320> no<00:00:49.500> more<00:00:49.710> than<00:00:49.890> what<00:00:50.010> we've<00:00:50.129> taken<00:00:50.370> out

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
that's no more than what we've taken out

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.430 
that's no more than what we've taken out
of<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.879> shadowed<00:00:51.210> area<00:00:51.480> from<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.260> bright

intermittently<00:00:57.390> no<00:00:58.109> this<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:58.859> most<00:00:59.489> people

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
intermittently no this is most people

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.369 
intermittently no this is most people
know<00:00:59.850> this<00:00:59.969> as<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.210> Stirling<00:01:00.600> engine<00:01:00.690> well<00:01:01.230> they

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
know this as a Stirling engine well they

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.410 
know this as a Stirling engine well they
would<00:01:01.770> know<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.010> as<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.190> sturdy<00:01:02.789> an<00:01:02.940> engine<00:01:03.239> or

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
would know it as a sturdy an engine or

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.240 
would know it as a sturdy an engine or
they're<00:01:04.019> gonna<00:01:04.170> be<00:01:04.350> confused<00:01:04.769> about<00:01:04.949> the

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
they're gonna be confused about the

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.679 
they're gonna be confused about the
mention<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.580> hydrogen<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.180> what<00:01:06.420> we<00:01:06.479> need<00:01:06.630> to

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
mention of hydrogen and what we need to

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.870 
mention of hydrogen and what we need to
emphasize<00:01:06.810> in<00:01:07.320> here<00:01:07.560> this<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.310> not<00:01:08.490> producing

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
emphasize in here this is not producing

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.000 
emphasize in here this is not producing
hydrogen<00:01:09.330> here<00:01:09.659> this<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.140> using<00:01:10.530> most<00:01:10.799> people

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
hydrogen here this is using most people

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.560 
hydrogen here this is using most people
to<00:01:11.070> understand<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.549> hydrogen<00:01:12.000> has<00:01:12.299> a

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
to understand that hydrogen has a

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.300 
to understand that hydrogen has a
phenomenal<00:01:13.380> ability<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.799> conduct<00:01:14.100> heat

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
phenomenal ability to conduct heat

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.859 
phenomenal ability to conduct heat
that's<00:01:14.729> pure<00:01:15.330> chemistry

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
that's pure chemistry

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.929 
that's pure chemistry
oh<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.080> course<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.310> wondering<00:01:17.640> why<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.759> can

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
oh of course is it wondering why you can

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.370 
oh of course is it wondering why you can
see<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:18.180> better<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.659> because<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.080> cloud

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
see this better is because the cloud

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.810 
see this better is because the cloud
just<00:01:19.710> went<00:01:19.890> in<00:01:20.040> front<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.369> Sun<00:01:20.640> that's

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
just went in front of the Sun that's

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.749 
just went in front of the Sun that's
right<00:01:21.110> so<00:01:22.110> when<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.619> cloud<00:01:22.799> passes<00:01:23.369> we'll<00:01:23.580> be

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
right so when the cloud passes we'll be

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.870 
right so when the cloud passes we'll be
heating<00:01:24.299> at<00:01:24.479> full<00:01:24.689> capacity<00:01:25.610> but<00:01:26.610> what<00:01:26.759> we're

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
heating at full capacity but what we're

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.190 
heating at full capacity but what we're
doing<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.210> meantime<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.810> just<00:01:27.990> showing

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
doing in the meantime is just showing

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.039 
doing in the meantime is just showing
how<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.939> heat<00:01:29.939> hydrogen<00:01:30.119> with<00:01:30.509> whatever<00:01:30.689> Solar

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049

oh<00:01:44.830> yeah<00:01:45.220> we're<00:01:45.430> showing<00:01:45.640> how<00:01:45.820> to<00:01:45.850> again<00:01:46.980> use

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:47.980 
oh yeah we're showing how to again use

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.480 
oh yeah we're showing how to again use
this<00:01:48.190> much<00:01:48.750> collector<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.770> a<00:01:50.890> concentrated

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
this much collector and a concentrated

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.030 

this<00:02:04.350> again<00:02:04.650> is<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.280> very<00:02:05.700> cost<00:02:06.300> effective<00:02:06.450> way

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
this again is a very cost effective way

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.410 
this again is a very cost effective way
to<00:02:08.040> convert<00:02:08.640> energy<00:02:08.850> where<00:02:09.270> there's

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
to convert energy where there's

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.869

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
from solar energy to electricity so we

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.089 
from solar energy to electricity so we
can<00:02:14.849> we<00:02:15.359> can<00:02:15.390> take<00:02:15.989> this<00:02:16.139> unit<00:02:16.379> right<00:02:16.530> here<00:02:16.680> and

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
can we can take this unit right here and

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.800 
can we can take this unit right here and
