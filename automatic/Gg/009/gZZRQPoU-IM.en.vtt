we have to try one more round guys I

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.929 
we have to try one more round guys I
mean<00:01:16.680> they<00:01:16.710> lost<00:01:16.979> bolt<00:01:17.280> but<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.490> really<00:01:17.759> feel

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
mean they lost bolt but I really feel

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.520 
mean they lost bolt but I really feel
like<00:01:17.970> they<00:01:18.180> could<00:01:18.240> win<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.750> mean<00:01:19.110> if<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.290> ender

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
like they could win I mean if the ender

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.440 
like they could win I mean if the ender
golem<00:01:19.770> switched<00:01:20.130> on<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.610> another<00:01:20.850> one<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.330> the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
golem switched on to another one in the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.149 
golem switched on to another one in the
middle<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.960> round<00:01:22.140> they'd<00:01:22.680> probably<00:01:22.860> win

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
middle of the round they'd probably win

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.950 
middle of the round they'd probably win
this<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.520> think<00:01:23.790> they<00:01:24.000> could<00:01:24.150> do<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.360> here<00:01:24.780> we<00:01:24.869> go

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
this I think they could do it here we go

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.800 
this I think they could do it here we go
round<00:01:25.259> 3<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.280> battle<00:01:26.670> has<00:01:26.820> begun<00:01:26.970> wow<00:01:27.600> they

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
they destroyed it I can't believe it

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.600 
they destroyed it I can't believe it
actually<00:04:39.690> there's<00:04:40.380> like<00:04:40.590> six<00:04:40.980> of<00:04:41.160> them<00:04:41.340> left

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610

alive so we're gonna do now is go to a
larger<00:04:45.180> battle<00:04:45.780> I<00:04:46.200> think<00:04:46.730> I<00:04:47.730> know<00:04:47.790> it<00:04:47.970> costs

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
larger battle I think I know it costs

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.910 
larger battle I think I know it costs
the<00:04:48.360> easy<00:04:48.540> win<00:04:48.840> for<00:04:48.870> the<00:04:49.110> ender<00:04:49.350> golems<00:04:49.680> last

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
round you know there were so many of

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.420 
round you know there were so many of
them<00:04:52.170> and<00:04:52.290> they<00:04:52.380> were<00:04:52.440> teaming<00:04:52.920> against<00:04:53.280> these

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
them and they were teaming against these

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.860

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.330 
dudes and they only have 20 health I
really<00:04:55.140> think<00:04:55.320> they<00:04:55.380> were<00:04:55.470> just<00:04:55.650> dying<00:04:55.920> so

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
really think they were just dying so

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.980 
really think they were just dying so
quickly<00:04:56.850> that<00:04:57.030> they<00:04:57.180> really<00:04:57.510> couldn't<00:04:57.720> kill

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
quickly that they really couldn't kill

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.870 
quickly that they really couldn't kill
