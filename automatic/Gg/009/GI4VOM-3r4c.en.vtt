lived<00:02:09.930> here<00:02:10.080> out<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.500> power<00:02:10.649> in<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:11.400> clouds

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
lived here out the power in the clouds

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.890 
lived here out the power in the clouds
look<00:02:11.790> ring<00:02:12.120> it's<00:02:12.300> about<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.320> happen<00:02:13.470> people

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
look ring it's about to happen people

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.120 
look ring it's about to happen people
but<00:02:15.900> I<00:02:16.050> just<00:02:16.230> want<00:02:16.410> you<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.590> see<00:02:16.710> the<00:02:16.800> sea<00:02:16.980> of

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
but I just want you to see the sea of

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.620 
but I just want you to see the sea of
water<00:02:17.340> i<00:02:17.460> don't<00:02:17.730> know<00:02:17.790> this<00:02:18.030> visible<00:02:18.420> but<00:02:18.570> I

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
water i don't know this visible but I

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.630 
water i don't know this visible but I
can<00:02:18.870> definitely<00:02:18.990> see<00:02:19.380> it<00:02:19.410> but<00:02:20.310> things<00:02:20.490> are

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
can definitely see it but things are

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.820 
can definitely see it but things are
getting<00:02:20.670> darker<00:02:21.210> getting<00:02:21.240> blacker<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:21.960> the

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
getting darker getting blacker and the

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.770 
getting darker getting blacker and the
power<00:02:23.100> is<00:02:23.220> going<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.430> go<00:02:23.520> out<00:02:23.550> I<00:02:23.970> think<00:02:24.630> it's<00:02:24.750> a

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
power is going to go out I think it's a

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.120 
power is going to go out I think it's a
good<00:02:24.900> idea<00:02:25.050> right<00:02:25.320> so<00:02:25.560> you<00:02:25.620> considering<00:02:26.040> all

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
good idea right so you considering all

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.030 
good idea right so you considering all
the<00:02:26.220> water<00:02:27.350> the<00:02:28.350> water's<00:02:28.620> going<00:02:28.740> to<00:02:28.830> continue

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
the water the water's going to continue

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.710 
the water the water's going to continue
to<00:02:29.190> rise<00:02:29.430> for<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.090> next<00:02:30.360> half<00:02:30.510> maybe<00:02:32.720> you

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
to rise for the next half maybe you

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.240 
to rise for the next half maybe you
might<00:02:33.870> receive<00:02:34.230> I'm<00:02:34.350> smelling<00:02:34.709> smoke<00:02:34.920> I<00:02:35.100> don't

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
might receive I'm smelling smoke I don't

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.760 
might receive I'm smelling smoke I don't
know<00:02:35.310> what<00:02:35.490> where<00:02:35.670> that<00:02:35.790> smoke<00:02:35.970> coming<00:02:36.570> from

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
know what where that smoke coming from

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.560 
know what where that smoke coming from
but<00:02:37.770> the<00:02:37.890> power<00:02:38.130> is<00:02:38.250> gradually<00:02:39.060> going<00:02:39.240> out

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
but the power is gradually going out

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.660 
but the power is gradually going out
people<00:02:40.020> as<00:02:40.200> you<00:02:40.980> can<00:02:41.010> see<00:02:41.250> we're<00:02:41.400> going<00:02:41.520> to<00:02:41.580> go

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
people as you can see we're going to go

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.340 
people as you can see we're going to go
inside<00:02:42.000> now<00:02:42.030> think<00:02:42.480> is<00:02:42.540> probably<00:02:42.750> safe<00:02:43.020> for

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
inside now think is probably safe for

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.430 
inside now think is probably safe for
wise<00:02:43.830> for<00:02:44.070> us<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:44.160> go<00:02:44.340> inside<00:02:44.870> but<00:02:46.970> it's<00:02:47.970> real

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
wise for us to go inside but it's real

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.510 
wise for us to go inside but it's real
it's<00:02:49.440> real<00:02:49.530> but<00:02:49.709> we're<00:02:49.860> okay<00:02:50.130> though<00:02:50.340> we're

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
it's real but we're okay though we're

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.100 
it's real but we're okay though we're
safe<00:02:50.730> where<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.060> building<00:02:51.240> we're<00:02:51.510> not<00:02:51.660> in<00:02:52.050> a

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
safe where the building we're not in a

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.070 
safe where the building we're not in a
house<00:02:52.290> where<00:02:52.620> up<00:02:52.770> we're<00:02:53.340> three<00:02:53.580> stories<00:02:53.940> up

house where up we're three stories up
all<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.320> power<00:02:55.530> went<00:02:55.709> out<00:02:55.830> of<00:02:55.950> that<00:02:56.070> building

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
all the power went out of that building

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.440 
all the power went out of that building
as<00:02:56.490> you<00:02:56.610> can<00:02:56.760> see<00:02:56.910> oh<00:02:57.980> and<00:02:58.980> we're<00:02:59.940> about<00:03:00.060> to<00:03:00.209> go

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
out guys it's been real when the power

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.490 
out guys it's been real when the power
comes<00:03:05.190> back<00:03:05.310> on<00:03:05.930> we're<00:03:06.930> gonna<00:03:07.050> make<00:03:07.230> another

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
comes back on we're gonna make another

it feels like and it's pretty intense
out<00:03:23.760> here<00:03:24.090> but<00:03:24.570> we're<00:03:24.720> okay<00:03:24.989> the<00:03:25.290> wind<00:03:25.530> is

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
out here but we're okay the wind is

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:26.780 
out here but we're okay the wind is
actually<00:03:25.920> dying<00:03:26.130> down<00:03:26.310> it's<00:03:26.489> actually<00:03:26.730> not

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
actually dying down it's actually not

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.180 
actually dying down it's actually not
even<00:03:27.030> raining<00:03:27.120> but<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:28.470> flood<00:03:28.769> the<00:03:29.130> streets

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
even raining but the flood the streets

if I had to make an assumption I'll say
at<00:03:34.680> least<00:03:34.709> four<00:03:35.070> or<00:03:36.030> five<00:03:36.420> feet<00:03:36.660> of<00:03:36.810> water

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
at least four or five feet of water

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.089 
at least four or five feet of water
you<00:03:39.370> still<00:03:39.580> have<00:03:39.730> wind<00:03:40.030> gusts<00:03:40.920> you<00:03:41.920> should

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
you still have wind gusts you should

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:43.530 
you still have wind gusts you should
have<00:03:42.220> a<00:03:42.250> lot<00:03:42.430> of<00:03:42.489> wind<00:03:42.730> out<00:03:42.879> here<00:03:43.150> and<00:03:43.390> the

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
have a lot of wind out here and the

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.150 
have a lot of wind out here and the
waters<00:03:43.900> is<00:03:44.200> still<00:03:44.530> going<00:03:44.709> to<00:03:44.800> continue<00:03:45.010> to
