00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
a ball-joint to a full range of motion

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.199 
a ball-joint to a full range of motion
there<00:02:08.140> I<00:02:08.470> guess<00:02:09.310> you<00:02:09.489> can<00:02:09.610> consider<00:02:09.940> this<00:02:10.090> a

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
there I guess you can consider this a

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.720 
there I guess you can consider this a
waist<00:02:10.420> joints<00:02:10.869> that<00:02:11.560> gifts<00:02:12.010> even<00:02:12.549> though<00:02:12.610> it

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
waist joints that gifts even though it

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.789 
waist joints that gifts even though it
is<00:02:12.820> more<00:02:12.940> for<00:02:13.120> transformations<00:02:13.720> lips<00:02:14.500> are<00:02:14.739> on

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
is more for transformations lips are on

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:16.110 
is more for transformations lips are on
a<00:02:14.830> ball-joint<00:02:15.100> but<00:02:15.459> they<00:02:15.549> are<00:02:15.640> pretty<00:02:15.850> limited

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
a ball-joint but they are pretty limited

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.830 
a ball-joint but they are pretty limited
and<00:02:16.600> we<00:02:17.410> go<00:02:17.560> about<00:02:17.830> that<00:02:18.310> far<00:02:18.519> back<00:02:18.700> that<00:02:19.660> far

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
and we go about that far back that far

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.460 
and we go about that far back that far
forward<00:02:20.260> in<00:02:20.410> that<00:02:21.190> far<00:02:21.430> out<00:02:21.580> so<00:02:22.260> limited<00:02:23.260> range

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
forward in that far out so limited range

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.300 
forward in that far out so limited range
of<00:02:23.620> motion<00:02:23.860> but<00:02:24.549> a<00:02:25.769> again<00:02:26.769> it's<00:02:26.950> a<00:02:27.010> legends

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
of motion but a again it's a legends

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.560 
of motion but a again it's a legends
class<00:02:27.519> figure<00:02:27.910> so<00:02:28.060> you<00:02:28.150> can't<00:02:28.330> really<00:02:28.480> expect

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
class figure so you can't really expect

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.740 
class figure so you can't really expect
