but<00:00:02.520> we<00:00:02.700> get<00:00:02.879> to<00:00:03.350> check<00:00:04.350> on<00:00:04.680> the<00:00:04.830> magnetism<00:00:05.250> of

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
but we get to check on the magnetism of

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.670 
but we get to check on the magnetism of
a<00:00:05.580> few<00:00:05.850> samples<00:00:06.299> the<00:00:06.960> three<00:00:07.170> samples<00:00:07.589> that

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
a few samples the three samples that

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.299 
a few samples the three samples that
I've<00:00:07.859> now<00:00:08.670> got<00:00:08.910> to<00:00:08.940> test<00:00:09.660> is<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.309> high

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
I've now got to test is the high

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.419 
I've now got to test is the high
temperature<00:00:11.639> run<00:00:12.200> from<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.830> high<00:00:14.160> temperature

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
temperature run from a high temperature

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.210 
temperature run from a high temperature
trial<00:00:14.880> about<00:00:15.240> weight<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:16.170> I've<00:00:17.010> got<00:00:17.160> the

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
trial about weight and I've got the

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.310 
trial about weight and I've got the
first<00:00:17.430> step<00:00:17.670> on<00:00:17.760> that<00:00:18.060> trial<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.990> second

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
first step on that trial and the second

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.080 
first step on that trial and the second
sample<00:00:19.590> which<00:00:20.010> I<00:00:20.189> if<00:00:20.460> you<00:00:20.550> watch<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.850> video

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
sample which I if you watch the video

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.910 
sample which I if you watch the video
then<00:00:22.400> is<00:00:23.400> more<00:00:23.699> cover<00:00:24.150> of<00:00:24.330> pepper<00:00:24.570> we<00:00:25.260> can<00:00:25.470> find

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
then is more cover of pepper we can find

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.910 
then is more cover of pepper we can find
the<00:00:26.039> explanation<00:00:26.640> in<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.849> video<00:00:27.090> there<00:00:27.300> and

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 
the explanation in the video there and

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.370 
the explanation in the video there and
the<00:00:28.920> third<00:00:29.550> sample<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.240> sample<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.990> just

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
the third sample is a sample of just

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.959 
the third sample is a sample of just
freshly<00:00:31.710> annealed<00:00:32.600> product<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:34.760> so<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:35.790> put

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
freshly annealed product so so I put

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.630 
freshly annealed product so so I put
here<00:00:36.059> trusty<00:00:36.690> car<00:00:37.290> speaker<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:39.230> we<00:00:40.230> can<00:00:40.640> we

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
here trusty car speaker and we can we

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.260 
here trusty car speaker and we can we
grab<00:00:41.910> this<00:00:42.120> sample<00:00:42.600> here<00:00:43.700> just<00:00:44.700> rotate<00:00:45.239> it

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
grab this sample here just rotate it

00:00:45.270 --> 00:01:03.260 
grab this sample here just rotate it
