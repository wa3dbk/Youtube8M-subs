00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.970 
version of myself when I was in high
school<00:02:24.040> that<00:02:24.460> was<00:02:25.300> faster<00:02:25.750> and<00:02:25.960> if<00:02:26.830> it's

school that was faster and if it's
possible<00:02:27.490> I<00:02:28.090> would<00:02:28.420> like<00:02:28.690> to<00:02:28.840> pick<00:02:29.020> my<00:02:29.200> shadow

basically<00:02:31.330> I<00:02:31.390> don't<00:02:31.660> think<00:02:31.810> you<00:02:31.870> can<00:02:31.960> get

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110

better<00:02:32.290> than<00:02:32.470> me<00:02:32.620> so<00:02:32.980> I<00:02:33.040> think<00:02:33.250> I<00:02:33.340> would<00:02:33.490> three

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.300 
better than me so I think I would three
realms<00:02:34.480> of<00:02:34.840> me<00:02:35.140> tell<00:02:35.440> us<00:02:35.560> who<00:02:35.680> you<00:02:35.980> would<00:02:36.160> pick
