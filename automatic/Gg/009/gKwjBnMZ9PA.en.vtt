design that all these companies are

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.290 
design that all these companies are
using<00:01:52.060> now<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:54.280> let's<00:01:54.399> remove<00:01:54.640> the<00:01:54.820> heatsink

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
using now so let's remove the heatsink

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.670 
using now so let's remove the heatsink
here

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.340 

as<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.830> can<00:01:58.950> see<00:01:59.189> it's<00:01:59.570> design<00:02:00.570> here<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.140> where

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
as you can see it's design here is where

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.450 
as you can see it's design here is where
they<00:02:01.380> get<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.740> name<00:02:02.180> vendetta<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.450> believe<00:02:04.460> got

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
they get the name vendetta I believe got

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.620 
they get the name vendetta I believe got
three<00:02:05.700> heat<00:02:05.939> pipes<00:02:06.210> all<00:02:06.780> aluminum<00:02:07.470> fins

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
three heat pipes all aluminum fins

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.479 
three heat pipes all aluminum fins

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
direct heat pipe touch technology I

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.070 
direct heat pipe touch technology I
don't<00:02:11.970> think<00:02:12.150> that's<00:02:12.330> what<00:02:12.510> this<00:02:12.690> company

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
don't think that's what this company

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.630 
don't think that's what this company
calls<00:02:13.380> it<00:02:13.620> but<00:02:13.770> that's<00:02:13.890> basically<00:02:14.160> what<00:02:14.520> it<00:02:14.550> is

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
calls it but that's basically what it is

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.420 
calls it but that's basically what it is
where<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.000> heat<00:02:15.180> pipes<00:02:15.450> make<00:02:16.290> direct<00:02:17.040> contact

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
where the heat pipes make direct contact

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.530 
where the heat pipes make direct contact
with<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:19.310> CPU<00:02:20.310> itself<00:02:20.459> instead<00:02:21.060> of<00:02:21.239> having<00:02:21.390> a

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
with the CPU itself instead of having a

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.360 
with the CPU itself instead of having a
copper<00:02:21.959> or<00:02:22.170> aluminum<00:02:22.200> base<00:02:22.800> that<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.190> heat

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
copper or aluminum base that the heat

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.210 
copper or aluminum base that the heat
must<00:02:23.519> transfer<00:02:24.090> through<00:02:24.620> you<00:02:25.620> can<00:02:25.769> see<00:02:25.950> here's

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
must transfer through you can see here's

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.780 
must transfer through you can see here's
where<00:02:26.459> you<00:02:26.580> mount<00:02:26.849> the<00:02:28.160> fan<00:02:29.160> right<00:02:29.370> there<00:02:29.430> on

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
where you mount the fan right there on

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.190 
where you mount the fan right there on
this<00:02:29.940> side<00:02:30.800> so<00:02:31.800> that's<00:02:31.980> about<00:02:32.130> it<00:02:32.250> guys
