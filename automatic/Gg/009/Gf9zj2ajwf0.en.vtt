or feathers we drew in we're gonna have
like<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.649> line<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.189> black<00:01:59.490> and<00:02:00.090> then<00:02:00.719> we're

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
like a line of black and then we're

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.389 
like a line of black and then we're
gonna<00:02:00.899> draw<00:02:01.110> on<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.350> triangles<00:02:04.189> almost<00:02:05.189> light

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
gonna draw on the triangles almost light

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.190 
gonna draw on the triangles almost light
tan<00:02:05.670> color<00:02:07.009> working<00:02:08.009> into<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.310> center

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
tan color working into the center

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.089 
tan color working into the center
oftentimes<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.319> don't<00:02:10.500> let<00:02:10.619> myself<00:02:10.770> be

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
oftentimes I don't let myself be

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.280 
oftentimes I don't let myself be
constricted<00:02:11.580> by<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.730> shapes<00:02:12.030> I've<00:02:12.239> set

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
constricted by the shapes I've set

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.390 
constricted by the shapes I've set
so<00:02:13.439> you<00:02:13.530> know<00:02:13.620> it's<00:02:13.769> kind<00:02:13.920> of<00:02:13.980> squiggle

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
so you know it's kind of squiggle

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.280 
so you know it's kind of squiggle
through<00:02:14.640> I<00:02:14.939> usually<00:02:15.689> find<00:02:15.870> actually<00:02:16.140> looks

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
through I usually find actually looks

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.539 
through I usually find actually looks
better<00:02:16.439> if<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:16.709> don't<00:02:16.860> fully<00:02:17.220> match

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
better if you don't fully match

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:19.160 
better if you don't fully match
everything<00:02:17.939> within<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.209> lines<00:02:18.420> but<00:02:18.989> you

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
everything within the lines but you

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.050 
everything within the lines but you
certainly<00:02:19.349> can<00:02:19.769> it's<00:02:20.340> kind<00:02:20.549> of<00:02:20.610> whatever<00:02:20.760> how

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
certainly can it's kind of whatever how

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.500 
certainly can it's kind of whatever how
ordered<00:02:21.480> your<00:02:21.569> drawing<00:02:21.870> style<00:02:22.170> is
