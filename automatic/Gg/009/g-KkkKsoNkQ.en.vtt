crystals that reset in the ear and we

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.370 
crystals that reset in the ear and we
thought<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.390> had<00:01:15.540> never<00:01:15.720> heard<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:16.049> this<00:01:16.170> all

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
that I could possibly do and so finally

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
actually help me you did a field test on

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.170 
actually help me you did a field test on
me<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:12.930> I<00:02:13.170> wasn't<00:02:13.980> liking<00:02:14.310> it<00:02:14.670> because<00:02:14.790> you

me and I wasn't liking it because you
were<00:02:15.300> kind<00:02:15.540> of<00:02:15.660> like<00:02:15.840> making<00:02:16.080> my<00:02:16.380> scooter<00:02:16.830> a

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
were kind of like making my scooter a

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.250 
were kind of like making my scooter a
little<00:02:17.250> crazy<00:02:17.520> I<00:02:17.910> was<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:18.240> test<00:02:18.480> like<00:02:18.690> there<00:02:19.170> are

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
little crazy I was a test like there are

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.140 
little crazy I was a test like there are
different<00:02:19.620> colors<00:02:19.920> and<00:02:20.400> they're<00:02:20.819> showing

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
different colors and they're showing

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.059 
different colors and they're showing
patterns<00:02:21.630> and<00:02:21.840> that<00:02:21.930> will<00:02:22.050> all<00:02:22.170> be<00:02:22.200> dizzy<00:02:22.739> yeah

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
patterns and that will all be dizzy yeah

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.500 
patterns and that will all be dizzy yeah
I<00:02:23.100> didn't<00:02:23.489> like<00:02:23.640> that<00:02:23.670> I'm<00:02:23.970> getting<00:02:24.270> close<00:02:24.480> and

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
I didn't like that I'm getting close and

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.030 
I didn't like that I'm getting close and
down<00:02:25.020> yeah

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
down yeah

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.300 
down yeah
so<00:02:26.400> finally<00:02:26.880> you<00:02:26.910> did<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.600> first<00:02:28.040> ser<00:02:29.040> and

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
so finally you did the first ser and

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.059 
so finally you did the first ser and
then<00:02:29.489> that<00:02:29.790> was<00:02:29.970> you<00:02:30.750> did<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:31.050> again<00:02:31.350> and<00:02:31.830> it

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
then that was you did it again and it

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.309 
then that was you did it again and it
was<00:02:32.160> like<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.520> first<00:02:32.730> time<00:02:32.910> I'm<00:02:33.209> not<00:02:33.480> that

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
was like the first time I'm not that

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.229 
was like the first time I'm not that
sensitive<00:02:34.770> to<00:02:35.250> because<00:02:35.550> anything<00:02:35.910> can

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
sensitive to because anything can

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.420 
sensitive to because anything can
trigger<00:02:36.269> over<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:36.840> go<00:02:37.040> when<00:02:38.040> you're<00:02:38.280> so

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
trigger over to go when you're so

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.430 
trigger over to go when you're so
sensitive<00:02:38.640> to<00:02:39.000> it<00:02:39.150> within<00:02:39.600> 15<00:02:40.050> minutes<00:02:40.230> that

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
sensitive to it within 15 minutes that

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.229 
sensitive to it within 15 minutes that
you<00:02:40.560> finish<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:40.920> test<00:02:41.160> he<00:02:41.340> we<00:02:41.670> did<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:42.000> test

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
you finish the test he we did the test

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.460 
you finish the test he we did the test
and<00:02:42.480> I<00:02:42.600> was<00:02:42.720> surprised

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
and I was surprised

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.530 
and I was surprised
cuz<00:02:43.920> I've<00:02:44.010> never<00:02:44.280> seen<00:02:44.519> her<00:02:44.640> be<00:02:45.150> able<00:02:45.420> to

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
cuz I've never seen her be able to

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.140 
cuz I've never seen her be able to
stabilize<00:02:45.750> herself<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:46.739> he<00:02:47.340> did<00:02:47.519> this<00:02:47.670> accent

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
stabilize herself and he did this accent

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.229 
stabilize herself and he did this accent
test<00:02:48.420> which<00:02:48.630> i<00:02:48.780> think<00:02:48.840> is<00:02:49.290> is<00:02:49.950> very<00:02:50.670> scientific

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
test which i think is is very scientific

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.020 
test which i think is is very scientific
proof<00:02:51.840> if<00:02:52.019> you<00:02:52.140> do<00:02:52.260> a<00:02:52.290> test<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:52.860> she<00:02:53.730> reacts

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
proof if you do a test and she reacts

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.490 
proof if you do a test and she reacts
one<00:02:54.209> way<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:54.540> then<00:02:54.630> you<00:02:54.720> do<00:02:54.870> a<00:02:54.900> treatment<00:02:55.140> you

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
one way and then you do a treatment you

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.190 
one way and then you do a treatment you
did<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.769> exact<00:02:56.069> same<00:02:56.310> treatment<00:02:56.580> and<00:02:57.200> 15

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
did the exact same treatment and 15

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.080 
did the exact same treatment and 15
minutes<00:02:58.470> later<00:02:58.680> she's<00:02:59.010> like<00:02:59.040> I've<00:02:59.580> never<00:02:59.760> seen

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
minutes later she's like I've never seen

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.670 
minutes later she's like I've never seen
her<00:03:00.150> with<00:03:00.330> bit<00:03:00.630> was<00:03:00.810> able<00:03:01.110> to<00:03:01.140> withstand<00:03:01.380> any

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
her with bit was able to withstand any

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.259 
her with bit was able to withstand any
color<00:03:02.130> changers<00:03:02.610> of<00:03:02.640> movements<00:03:03.150> without

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
color changers of movements without

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.229 
color changers of movements without
getting<00:03:03.810> dizzy<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:05.160> so<00:03:05.580> when<00:03:05.730> I<00:03:05.819> gets<00:03:06.030> here

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
getting dizzy and so when I gets here

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.759 
getting dizzy and so when I gets here
because<00:03:06.360> once<00:03:06.720> it<00:03:06.870> starts<00:03:07.140> triggering<00:03:07.410> which

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
because once it starts triggering which

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.620 
because once it starts triggering which
you<00:03:07.920> start<00:03:08.160> telling<00:03:08.459> me<00:03:08.489> I'm<00:03:09.180> feeling<00:03:09.390> little

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
you start telling me I'm feeling little

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.590 
you start telling me I'm feeling little
bit<00:03:09.780> off<00:03:09.930> its<00:03:10.260> run<00:03:10.650> to<00:03:10.860> the<00:03:10.980> house<00:03:11.160> and<00:03:11.670> go<00:03:12.540> to

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
bit off its run to the house and go to

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.350 
bit off its run to the house and go to
bed<00:03:12.810> like<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.320> ice<00:03:13.470> packs<00:03:13.890> and<00:03:14.400> maybe<00:03:15.030> be

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
bed like the ice packs and maybe be

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.880 
bed like the ice packs and maybe be
covered<00:03:15.750> really<00:03:15.989> quick<00:03:16.290> outs<00:03:16.470> yeah<00:03:18.890> normally

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
covered really quick outs yeah normally

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.370 
covered really quick outs yeah normally
I<00:03:19.920> mean<00:03:20.370> I<00:03:20.489> do<00:03:21.090> have<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.450> disease<00:03:21.780> near<00:03:22.110> so

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
I mean I do have the disease near so

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.080 
I mean I do have the disease near so
it's<00:03:22.530> not<00:03:22.650> like<00:03:22.829> I<00:03:22.950> can<00:03:23.160> really<00:03:23.519> reverse<00:03:23.910> that

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
it's not like I can really reverse that

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.080 
it's not like I can really reverse that
that<00:03:24.269> much<00:03:24.480> but<00:03:25.230> I<00:03:25.260> do<00:03:25.410> noticed<00:03:26.010> a<00:03:26.340> an

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
that much but I do noticed a an

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.600 
that much but I do noticed a an
improvement<00:03:27.600> in<00:03:28.110> my<00:03:28.290> recovery<00:03:28.769> like<00:03:29.160> I<00:03:29.370> can

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
improvement in my recovery like I can

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.210 
improvement in my recovery like I can
I'm<00:03:30.510> recovering<00:03:31.079> a<00:03:31.200> little<00:03:31.440> better<00:03:31.590> from<00:03:31.860> it<00:03:32.070> I

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
I'm recovering a little better from it I

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.490 
I'm recovering a little better from it I
am<00:03:32.459> a<00:03:32.489> little<00:03:32.730> less<00:03:33.180> sensitive<00:03:33.420> than<00:03:34.230> it<00:03:34.350> was

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
am a little less sensitive than it was

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.860 
am a little less sensitive than it was
before<00:03:34.709> and<00:03:35.220> they<00:03:35.430> don't<00:03:35.609> let<00:03:35.760> us<00:03:35.820> five<00:03:36.540> or<00:03:36.720> six

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
before and they don't let us five or six

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.150 
before and they don't let us five or six
hours<00:03:37.200> it<00:03:37.350> was<00:03:37.410> just<00:03:37.590> a<00:03:37.650> matter<00:03:37.829> of<00:03:37.950> ten

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
hours it was just a matter of ten

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.710
