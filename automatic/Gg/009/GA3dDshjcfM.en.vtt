now

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:46.690 

as<00:03:35.040> you<00:03:35.310> see<00:03:35.489> we<00:03:35.640> get<00:03:35.819> this<00:03:36.120> called<00:03:37.849> the<00:03:38.849> color

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.330 

also<00:03:47.700> you<00:03:48.150> should<00:03:48.300> try<00:03:48.569> with<00:03:48.810> your<00:03:49.019> own

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
also you should try with your own

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.750 
also you should try with your own
properties<00:03:50.340> in<00:03:51.000> China<00:03:51.450> mixer

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
properties in China mixer

00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:22.379 
properties in China mixer
maybe<00:03:54.599> you<00:03:54.810> can<00:03:54.989> find<00:03:55.230> something<00:03:55.500> better

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:26.339 

and<00:04:22.979> I<00:04:23.979> don't<00:04:24.340> think<00:04:24.580> it's<00:04:25.030> a<00:04:25.389> great<00:04:25.689> idea<00:04:25.870> to

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:26.349 
and I don't think it's a great idea to

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:31.379 
and I don't think it's a great idea to
clear<00:04:26.740> the<00:04:26.919> hair<00:04:27.129> right<00:04:27.460> now<00:04:28.710> because<00:04:30.210> you<00:04:31.210> can

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
clear the hair right now because you can

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.159 
clear the hair right now because you can
destroy<00:04:31.840> the<00:04:32.020> image<00:04:32.199> that<00:04:32.879> I<00:04:33.879> change<00:04:34.780> opacity

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
destroy the image that I change opacity

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:41.369 
destroy the image that I change opacity
to<00:04:35.590> 60%<00:04:35.770> and<00:04:37.259> clear<00:04:38.259> but<00:04:38.500> just<00:04:39.250> a<00:04:39.490> little<00:04:40.379> side

00:04:41.369 --> 00:04:41.379 
to 60% and clear but just a little side

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:45.589 
to 60% and clear but just a little side
don't<00:04:41.650> wanna<00:04:41.860> and<00:04:42.449> stri<00:04:43.449> this<00:04:43.750> effect<00:04:44.650> and<00:04:44.919> and

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:45.599 
don't wanna and stri this effect and and

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:54.959 
don't wanna and stri this effect and and
make<00:04:46.599> it<00:04:46.810> unnatural<00:04:52.620> but<00:04:53.620> when<00:04:54.039> you<00:04:54.219> decided

00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:54.969 
make it unnatural but when you decided

00:04:54.969 --> 00:05:06.469 
make it unnatural but when you decided
to<00:04:55.120> do<00:04:55.360> this<00:04:56.340> you<00:04:57.340> should<00:04:57.610> be<00:04:57.849> very<00:04:58.409> careful

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:11.369 

it's<00:05:07.479> almost<00:05:07.689> done<00:05:08.050> I<00:05:09.029> change<00:05:10.029> opacity<00:05:10.810> on

00:05:11.369 --> 00:05:11.379 
it's almost done I change opacity on

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:19.290 
it's almost done I change opacity on
this<00:05:12.029> to<00:05:13.029> 50%<00:05:14.939> and<00:05:16.199> now<00:05:17.199> I<00:05:17.229> think<00:05:18.039> it<00:05:18.969> looks

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
this to 50% and now I think it looks

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:27.080 
this to 50% and now I think it looks
much<00:05:19.539> better

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.260 

and<00:05:27.500> now<00:05:28.500> our<00:05:28.740> imagery<00:05:29.250> is<00:05:29.340> to<00:05:29.580> our<00:05:29.760> my<00:05:29.970> thing

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
and now our imagery is to our my thing

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:36.860 
and now our imagery is to our my thing

so again go to channel mixer and present

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.409 
so again go to channel mixer and present
default<00:05:37.260> and<00:05:37.530> now<00:05:38.040> output<00:05:38.639> channel<00:05:39.090> you<00:05:39.210> read

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
default and now output channel you read

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:45.290 
default and now output channel you read
and<00:05:40.520> change<00:05:41.520> right<00:05:42.270> to<00:05:42.660> 50<00:05:43.590> or<00:05:43.830> 60<00:05:44.520> percent

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
and change right to 50 or 60 percent

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:57.400 
and change right to 50 or 60 percent
I<00:05:45.800> put<00:05:46.800> 55<00:05:47.430> right<00:05:48.150> now<00:05:49.940> and<00:05:52.550> change<00:05:53.550> opacity<00:05:53.790> to

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:02.960 

35<00:05:58.410> percent<00:06:00.800> it<00:06:01.800> should<00:06:02.160> be<00:06:02.340> okay

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:02.970 
35 percent it should be okay

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.760 
35 percent it should be okay
as<00:06:03.030> you<00:06:03.419> see<00:06:03.630> it's<00:06:03.780> huge<00:06:04.260> difference<00:06:06.590> but<00:06:07.590> it

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.770 
as you see it's huge difference but it

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.100 
as you see it's huge difference but it
doesn't<00:06:08.160> look<00:06:08.280> perfect<00:06:08.760> so<00:06:08.850> it's<00:06:09.510> good<00:06:09.810> idea

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.110 
doesn't look perfect so it's good idea

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:16.550 
doesn't look perfect so it's good idea
to<00:06:10.440> add<00:06:10.680> some<00:06:11.010> contrast<00:06:11.580> so<00:06:15.080> click<00:06:16.080> here<00:06:16.350> and

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
to add some contrast so click here and

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:22.640 
to add some contrast so click here and
go<00:06:16.919> to<00:06:17.300> brightness<00:06:18.300> and<00:06:18.539> contrast<00:06:18.750> and<00:06:20.900> I<00:06:21.900> said

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:22.650 
go to brightness and contrast and I said

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:30.650 
go to brightness and contrast and I said
contrast<00:06:23.280> at<00:06:23.630> 60<00:06:24.630> and<00:06:28.729> now<00:06:29.729> I<00:06:29.760> think<00:06:29.910> it<00:06:30.419> looks

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:30.660 
contrast at 60 and now I think it looks

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.320 
contrast at 60 and now I think it looks
really<00:06:31.020> nice

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:34.330 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.899
