that are so beautiful and I think that

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.550 
that are so beautiful and I think that
they<00:00:26.539> get<00:00:26.690> overlooked<00:00:27.230> so<00:00:27.530> often<00:00:28.010> I<00:00:29.350> keep<00:00:30.350> this

in my memory and then I take it into the
studio<00:00:32.780> with<00:00:33.170> me<00:00:35.020> the<00:00:36.020> glazing<00:00:36.500> technique<00:00:36.890> is

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
studio with me the glazing technique is

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.560 
studio with me the glazing technique is
something<00:00:37.340> that<00:00:37.550> the<00:00:37.670> old<00:00:37.760> masters<00:00:38.239> used<00:00:38.420> to

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
something that the old masters used to

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.410 
something that the old masters used to
do<00:00:38.720> but<00:00:39.320> I've<00:00:39.440> found<00:00:40.130> new<00:00:40.399> materials<00:00:40.970> to<00:00:41.270> use

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
start to form colors appear when I start

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.209 
start to form colors appear when I start
to<00:00:59.149> see<00:00:59.300> those<00:00:59.450> things<00:00:59.780> in<00:00:59.989> my<00:01:00.110> work<00:01:00.350> I<00:01:00.710> would

a hike that I went on the other day or

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:07.959 
a hike that I went on the other day or
that<00:01:05.990> was<00:01:06.170> at<00:01:06.319> the<00:01:06.439> lake<00:01:06.639> that<00:01:07.639> was<00:01:07.819> the

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:07.969 
that was at the lake that was the

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:10.149 
that was at the lake that was the
reflection<00:01:08.240> in<00:01:08.630> the<00:01:08.659> water<00:01:08.869> so<00:01:09.799> those<00:01:09.979> are

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
reflection in the water so those are

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:11.859 
reflection in the water so those are
things<00:01:10.340> that<00:01:10.459> I<00:01:10.609> start<00:01:11.179> to<00:01:11.299> notice<00:01:11.479> when<00:01:11.840> I'm

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
things that I start to notice when I'm

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:13.809 
things that I start to notice when I'm
creating<00:01:12.469> and<00:01:12.709> I<00:01:12.829> bring<00:01:13.100> those<00:01:13.249> out<00:01:13.459> as<00:01:13.670> much

00:01:13.809 --> 00:01:13.819 
creating and I bring those out as much

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:18.270

as<00:01:13.969> possible

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.370 

making<00:01:19.280> those<00:01:19.430> highlights<00:01:20.030> in<00:01:20.450> the<00:01:20.960> paintings

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
making those highlights in the paintings

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:30.929 
making those highlights in the paintings
or<00:01:21.560> what<00:01:21.830> I<00:01:21.860> call<00:01:22.070> pops

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.899 

all<00:01:31.939> these<00:01:32.210> places<00:01:32.570> are<00:01:33.310> just<00:01:34.310> things<00:01:34.549> in<00:01:34.700> my

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
all these places are just things in my

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:47.030 
all these places are just things in my
mind<00:01:35.119> things<00:01:35.869> in<00:01:36.020> my<00:01:36.140> heart

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:02:06.469 

I<00:02:03.470> think<00:02:04.470> of<00:02:04.590> my<00:02:04.740> paintings<00:02:05.160> as<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.340> journey<00:02:05.700> and

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
I think of my paintings as a journey and

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.690 
I think of my paintings as a journey and
I<00:02:07.260> like<00:02:07.470> to<00:02:07.620> take<00:02:07.770> people<00:02:08.160> on<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.460> journey

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
I like to take people on that journey
