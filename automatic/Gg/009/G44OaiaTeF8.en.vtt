00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
fancier presentation so let's go ahead

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.799 
fancier presentation so let's go ahead
and<00:00:40.129> remove<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.340> tab<00:00:41.550> there<00:00:41.940> let's<00:00:42.660> go<00:00:42.780> ahead

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
and remove the tab there let's go ahead

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.979 
and remove the tab there let's go ahead
and<00:00:43.320> open<00:00:43.969> up<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.120> box<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:45.780> you're<00:00:45.899> going

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
and open up the box and so you're going

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.990 
and open up the box and so you're going
to<00:00:46.050> have<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.440> white<00:00:46.800> plastic<00:00:47.250> box<00:00:47.489> so<00:00:47.730> this<00:00:47.789> what

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
to have a white plastic box so this what

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.549 
to have a white plastic box so this what
differentiates<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.809> guess<00:00:49.320> one<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.469> the

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
differentiates I guess one of the

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.319 
differentiates I guess one of the
premium<00:00:49.829> bands<00:00:50.100> over<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.550> sports<00:00:50.910> bands<00:00:51.270> the

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
premium bands over the sports bands the

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.700 
premium bands over the sports bands the
sport<00:00:51.570> mats<00:00:51.719> going<00:00:51.870> with<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:51.989> little<00:00:52.050> cardboard

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
sport mats going with a little cardboard

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.619 
sport mats going with a little cardboard
and<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.430> band's<00:00:53.640> are<00:00:53.789> in<00:00:53.910> them<00:00:54.090> where<00:00:54.510> the

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
and the band's are in them where the

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.010 
and the band's are in them where the
premium<00:00:54.960> bands<00:00:55.289> have<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.850> actual<00:00:57.329> box<00:00:57.690> so

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
premium bands have the actual box so

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.840 
premium bands have the actual box so
another<00:00:58.649> pool<00:00:58.920> tab<00:00:59.100> in<00:00:59.250> here<00:00:59.280> nothing<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.699> know

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
another pool tab in here nothing to know

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.549 
another pool tab in here nothing to know
is<00:01:00.059> going<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.390> be<00:01:00.449> some<00:01:00.690> paperwork<00:01:01.109> and

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
of the fact that sizing so I thought I

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.719 
of the fact that sizing so I thought I
was<00:01:21.990> going<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.170> be<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> large<00:01:22.740> with<00:01:23.310> these<00:01:23.430> bands

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729

and I was way off I tried the large and
the<00:01:26.040> store<00:01:26.250> was<00:01:26.340> huge<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.180> I'm<00:01:27.810> actually<00:01:27.990> a
