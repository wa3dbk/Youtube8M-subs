00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
happen is those little pieces of cloth

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.309 
happen is those little pieces of cloth
will<00:02:12.150> fill<00:02:12.420> up<00:02:12.450> and

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
will fill up and

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.699 
will fill up and
as<00:02:13.499> much<00:02:13.680> water<00:02:14.060> so<00:02:15.060> that<00:02:15.269> the<00:02:16.049> water<00:02:16.560> doesn't

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
as much water so that the water doesn't

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.429 
as much water so that the water doesn't
actually<00:02:17.069> get<00:02:17.310> through<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:18.319> penetrate<00:02:19.319> your

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:19.439 
actually get through and penetrate your

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:22.610 
actually get through and penetrate your
iphone<00:02:19.799> speaker<00:02:20.069> and<00:02:20.430> microphone<00:02:20.780> so<00:02:21.780> that's

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
iphone speaker and microphone so that's

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.059 
iphone speaker and microphone so that's
how<00:02:22.769> that<00:02:22.889> that's<00:02:23.370> why<00:02:23.519> that's<00:02:23.760> there<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:25.069> I'm

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
how that that's why that's there and I'm

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.229 
how that that's why that's there and I'm
going<00:02:26.189> to<00:02:26.280> go<00:02:26.340> ahead<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:26.670> actually<00:02:26.760> put<00:02:27.060> my

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
going to go ahead and actually put my

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.059 
going to go ahead and actually put my
iphone<00:02:27.930> in<00:02:28.109> here<00:02:28.290> just<00:02:28.499> to<00:02:28.620> show<00:02:28.799> you<00:02:28.829> how<00:02:29.040> easy

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
iphone in here just to show you how easy

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.569 
iphone in here just to show you how easy
it<00:02:29.519> it<00:02:29.939> slides<00:02:30.299> right<00:02:30.510> in<00:02:30.750> so<00:02:31.409> basically<00:02:31.889> we

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
it it slides right in so basically we

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:41.440 
it it slides right in so basically we
just<00:02:32.609> take<00:02:33.510> it<00:02:34.819> and<00:02:37.760> slide<00:02:38.760> it<00:02:38.790> right<00:02:38.939> in<00:02:39.209> there

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.399 

so<00:02:42.450> that's<00:02:42.540> that's<00:02:42.840> pretty<00:02:42.959> much<00:02:43.139> how<00:02:43.260> that

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
so that's that's pretty much how that

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:45.170 
so that's that's pretty much how that
works<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:43.919> what<00:02:44.310> we're<00:02:44.400> going<00:02:44.489> to<00:02:44.579> do<00:02:44.760> is<00:02:44.969> just

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
works and what we're going to do is just

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.959 
works and what we're going to do is just
clamp<00:02:46.049> it<00:02:46.200> on<00:02:46.909> and<00:02:49.129> now<00:02:50.129> the<00:02:50.189> iphone<00:02:50.939> is

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:50.969 
clamp it on and now the iphone is

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:54.979 
clamp it on and now the iphone is
completely<00:02:52.099> encased<00:02:53.099> in<00:02:53.310> this<00:02:53.489> rubber<00:02:53.989> again

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
completely encased in this rubber again

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.330 
completely encased in this rubber again
you<00:02:55.109> can<00:02:55.139> completely<00:02:55.590> manipulate<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.159> case

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
you can completely manipulate the case

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.069 
you can completely manipulate the case
of<00:02:56.639> the<00:02:56.790> phone<00:02:56.969> through<00:02:57.150> this<00:02:57.269> case<00:02:57.510> it's<00:02:57.840> just

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
of the phone through this case it's just

00:02:58.079 --> 00:02:59.689 
of the phone through this case it's just
a<00:02:58.169> regular<00:02:58.319> iphone<00:02:58.650> at<00:02:58.949> this<00:02:59.069> point<00:02:59.340> and<00:02:59.459> good

00:02:59.689 --> 00:02:59.699 
a regular iphone at this point and good

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:03.439 
a regular iphone at this point and good
and<00:02:59.939> just<00:03:00.750> slide<00:03:01.019> that<00:03:01.049> right<00:03:01.379> through<00:03:02.449> and

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:03.449 
and just slide that right through and

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:06.409 
and just slide that right through and
there<00:03:03.629> you<00:03:03.750> go<00:03:03.900> so<00:03:04.760> we<00:03:05.760> can<00:03:05.879> just<00:03:05.939> hit<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.209> hold

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:06.419 
there you go so we can just hit the hold

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:11.030 
there you go so we can just hit the hold
switch<00:03:06.540> up<00:03:06.780> on<00:03:06.900> top<00:03:08.510> well<00:03:09.590> there<00:03:10.590> you<00:03:10.620> go<00:03:10.739> and

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
switch up on top well there you go and

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.860 
switch up on top well there you go and
you<00:03:11.969> can<00:03:12.000> see<00:03:12.209> we've<00:03:12.329> got<00:03:12.359> the<00:03:12.510> headphone<00:03:12.840> jack

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
you can see we've got the headphone jack

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.699 
you can see we've got the headphone jack
up<00:03:13.290> there<00:03:13.730> so<00:03:14.780> that's<00:03:15.780> that's<00:03:16.139> the<00:03:16.319> case<00:03:16.469> right

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
up there so that's that's the case right

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.580 
up there so that's that's the case right
here<00:03:16.980> it<00:03:17.459> does<00:03:17.669> not<00:03:17.790> come<00:03:18.150> with<00:03:18.389> a<00:03:18.599> holster<00:03:19.560> or

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
here it does not come with a holster or

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.219 
here it does not come with a holster or
a<00:03:19.889> clip<00:03:20.430> which<00:03:20.669> is<00:03:20.879> kind<00:03:21.540> of<00:03:21.629> a<00:03:21.750> downside<00:03:22.199> for

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:22.229 
a clip which is kind of a downside for

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:25.009 
a clip which is kind of a downside for
me<00:03:22.620> I<00:03:22.769> was<00:03:23.669> I<00:03:23.849> was<00:03:24.000> really<00:03:24.239> hoping<00:03:24.419> that<00:03:24.629> this

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
me I was I was really hoping that this

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.780 
me I was I was really hoping that this
case<00:03:25.229> would<00:03:25.439> come<00:03:25.680> with<00:03:25.859> something<00:03:26.519> that<00:03:26.759> I

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
case would come with something that I

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.899 
case would come with something that I
could<00:03:26.879> carry<00:03:27.269> it<00:03:27.419> with<00:03:27.769> as<00:03:28.769> it<00:03:29.310> stands<00:03:29.549> I<00:03:29.790> mean

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:29.909 
could carry it with as it stands I mean

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:31.490 
could carry it with as it stands I mean
this<00:03:30.030> I'm<00:03:30.359> have<00:03:30.509> to<00:03:30.599> either<00:03:30.659> carry<00:03:31.049> it<00:03:31.199> in<00:03:31.319> a

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
this I'm have to either carry it in a

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.159 
this I'm have to either carry it in a
pair<00:03:31.709> of<00:03:31.799> cargo<00:03:32.040> pants<00:03:32.370> or<00:03:32.549> find<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.689> clip

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:34.169 
pair of cargo pants or find the clip

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:36.530 
pair of cargo pants or find the clip
that<00:03:34.379> will<00:03:34.530> fit<00:03:34.799> something<00:03:35.129> like<00:03:35.340> this<00:03:35.549> it<00:03:36.359> is

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
that will fit something like this it is

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.009 
that will fit something like this it is
a<00:03:36.569> much<00:03:37.019> larger<00:03:37.970> case<00:03:38.970> than<00:03:39.269> normal<00:03:39.689> trying<00:03:39.959> to

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
a much larger case than normal trying to

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.080 
a much larger case than normal trying to
see<00:03:40.139> if<00:03:40.199> I<00:03:40.259> can<00:03:40.319> compared<00:03:40.829> to<00:03:41.009> something<00:03:41.250> here

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
see if I can compared to something here

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.539 
see if I can compared to something here
is<00:03:42.269> a<00:03:44.389> who's<00:03:45.389> a<00:03:45.419> CD<00:03:45.900> or<00:03:45.930> a<00:03:46.169> DVD<00:03:46.340> just<00:03:47.340> to<00:03:47.430> give

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
is a who's a CD or a DVD just to give

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:51.530 
is a who's a CD or a DVD just to give
you<00:03:47.639> an<00:03:47.699> idea<00:03:47.790> of<00:03:48.479> how<00:03:48.750> big<00:03:49.459> the<00:03:50.459> the<00:03:50.759> cases<00:03:51.239> in

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
you an idea of how big the the cases in

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.009 
you an idea of how big the the cases in
comparison<00:03:52.379> so<00:03:53.159> it<00:03:54.120> is<00:03:54.150> definitely<00:03:54.599> a<00:03:54.810> much

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
comparison so it is definitely a much

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.409 
comparison so it is definitely a much
larger<00:03:55.470> case<00:03:55.739> but<00:03:56.489> it<00:03:56.669> is<00:03:56.819> going<00:03:57.000> to<00:03:57.060> protect

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419 
larger case but it is going to protect

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:00.379 
larger case but it is going to protect
your<00:03:57.540> phone<00:03:57.750> from<00:03:58.579> if<00:03:59.579> you<00:03:59.729> should<00:03:59.939> drop<00:04:00.120> it<00:04:00.299> in

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
your phone from if you should drop it in

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:03.319 
your phone from if you should drop it in
the<00:04:00.479> water<00:04:00.509> in<00:04:00.870> a<00:04:00.900> pool<00:04:01.519> you<00:04:02.519> should<00:04:02.669> be<00:04:02.790> ok<00:04:03.090> the

phone should be fine a couple couple
issues<00:04:06.599> with<00:04:06.900> the<00:04:06.989> case<00:04:07.169> one<00:04:07.709> as<00:04:07.859> you<00:04:07.949> can<00:04:08.069> see

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:08.219 
issues with the case one as you can see

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:10.729 
issues with the case one as you can see
there<00:04:08.370> is<00:04:08.400> no<00:04:08.840> access<00:04:09.840> to<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:10.199> silence<00:04:10.530> which

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
there is no access to the silence which

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.439 
there is no access to the silence which

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:13.480 
do away with that and even so much as i

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.330 
do away with that and even so much as i
can<00:05:13.600> so<00:05:13.930> much<00:05:14.050> to<00:05:14.350> say<00:05:14.500> is<00:05:14.680> even<00:05:14.830> doing<00:05:15.190> with
