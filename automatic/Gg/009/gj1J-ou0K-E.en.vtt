00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
clay and hardened clay so that suppose

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.620 
clay and hardened clay so that suppose
I'm<00:00:31.500> pretty<00:00:31.920> like<00:00:32.369> 90%<00:00:32.820> sure<00:00:33.270> it's<00:00:33.450> gonna<00:00:33.540> be

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
pressure plates that looked exactly like

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.260 
pressure plates that looked exactly like
stained<00:00:48.719> clay<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.309> anyway<00:00:50.309> I'm<00:00:50.700> gonna<00:00:50.910> talk<00:00:51.239> to

such things like that how do you make it
I<00:00:54.329> will<00:00:54.510> have<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.780> hop<00:00:54.930> over<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.170> PC<00:00:55.440> so

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
I will have to hop over to PC so

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.740 
I will have to hop over to PC so
currently<00:00:56.129> on<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.309> consoles<00:00:56.730> again<00:00:57.420> we<00:00:57.570> have

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
currently on the consoles again we have

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.750 
currently on the consoles again we have
clay<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.500> we<00:00:58.590> have<00:00:58.680> clay<00:00:58.890> blocks<00:00:59.160> what<00:00:59.399> we<00:00:59.489> do

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
clay and we have clay blocks what we do

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.939 
clay and we have clay blocks what we do
not<00:00:59.969> what<00:01:00.510> we<00:01:00.629> cannot<00:01:01.050> make<00:01:01.379> hardened<00:01:01.829> clay

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
not what we cannot make hardened clay

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.740 
not what we cannot make hardened clay
and<00:01:02.280> how<00:01:02.760> do<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:02.940> make<00:01:03.090> hardened<00:01:03.449> clay<00:01:03.510> you

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
and how do you make hardened clay you

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.750 
and how do you make hardened clay you
basically<00:01:04.049> just<00:01:04.140> put<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.309> furnace

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
basically just put that in the furnace

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.730 
basically just put that in the furnace
so<00:01:06.030> as<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.570> see<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:06.720> just<00:01:06.780> put<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.170> there<00:01:07.290> but

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
so as you see I just put it there but

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.410 
so as you see I just put it there but
let's<00:01:07.860> hop<00:01:07.979> over<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.220> PC<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.790> as<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.270> can<00:01:09.360> see

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
let's hop over to PC and as you can see

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.380 
let's hop over to PC and as you can see
the<00:01:10.049> clay<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.560> actually<00:01:10.979> smelting<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:11.820> that

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
the clay is actually smelting so that

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.010 
the clay is actually smelting so that
should<00:01:12.659> give<00:01:12.810> us<00:01:12.840> hardened<00:01:13.439> clay<00:01:13.590> whoo<00:01:15.020> first

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
should give us hardened clay whoo first

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.260 
should give us hardened clay whoo first
part<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.560> job<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:16.860> done<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:17.909> now<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.119> we

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
part of the job is done so now that we

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.539 
part of the job is done so now that we
have<00:01:18.450> hardened<00:01:18.869> clay<00:01:18.990> it's<00:01:19.860> time<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.340> start

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
have hardened clay it's time to start

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.219 
have hardened clay it's time to start
staining<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:21.509> all<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.780> want<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:21.990> do<00:01:22.080> is

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
staining it so all you want to do is

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.780 
staining it so all you want to do is
just<00:01:22.380> throw<00:01:22.619> some<00:01:22.890> water<00:01:23.100> on<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.310> know<00:01:23.580> that

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
just throw some water on it know that

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.880 
just throw some water on it know that
that<00:01:24.240> wouldn't<00:01:24.450> really<00:01:24.600> stain<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.470> but<00:01:25.710> it

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
that wouldn't really stain it but it

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.460 
that wouldn't really stain it but it
will<00:01:25.979> probably<00:01:26.189> clean<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:27.080> so<00:01:28.080> there<00:01:28.229> we<00:01:28.320> have

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
will probably clean it so there we have

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.340 
will probably clean it so there we have
that<00:01:28.500> there<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.479> all<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.720> need<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:30.990> do<00:01:31.140> is

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
that there and all you need to do is

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.679 
that there and all you need to do is
just<00:01:31.590> get<00:01:31.770> dye<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.549> you're<00:01:33.000> gonna<00:01:33.119> surround

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
just get dye and you're gonna surround

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.499 
just get dye and you're gonna surround
it<00:01:33.930> well<00:01:34.350> on<00:01:34.710> manual<00:01:35.490> we<00:01:35.640> don't<00:01:36.000> have<00:01:36.119> manual

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
it well on manual we don't have manual

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.270 
it well on manual we don't have manual
crafting<00:01:36.930> so<00:01:37.110> I'm<00:01:37.350> assuming<00:01:37.710> once<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.159> get

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
crafting so I'm assuming once you get

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.649 
crafting so I'm assuming once you get
the<00:01:38.400> dye<00:01:38.520> you'll<00:01:38.729> probably<00:01:38.970> go<00:01:39.210> over<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.479> clay

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
the dye you'll probably go over the clay

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.899 
the dye you'll probably go over the clay
and<00:01:39.869> just<00:01:40.320> dye<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.590> like<00:01:40.950> we<00:01:41.100> do<00:01:41.250> our<00:01:41.369> armor<00:01:41.729> if

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
and just dye it like we do our armor if

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.700 
and just dye it like we do our armor if
you<00:01:42.090> know<00:01:42.270> what<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.450> mean<00:01:42.689> like<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:43.350> take<00:01:43.560> the

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
you know what I mean like you take the

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.319 
you know what I mean like you take the
dye<00:01:43.829> go<00:01:44.130> over<00:01:44.460> what<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:44.850> whatever<00:01:45.210> in<00:01:45.299> your

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
dye go over what it whatever in your

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.149 
dye go over what it whatever in your
inventory<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.899> press<00:01:46.110> X<00:01:46.290> or<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.799> think<00:01:46.920> to

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
inventory you press X or so I think to

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.980 
inventory you press X or so I think to
dye<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.340> but<00:01:48.000> yeah<00:01:48.119> that's<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:48.750> there<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:48.930> think

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
dye it but yeah that's it there I think

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.139 
dye it but yeah that's it there I think
a<00:01:49.170> lot<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.320> builders<00:01:49.740> will<00:01:50.009> still<00:01:50.250> use<00:01:50.579> wool

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
a lot of builders will still use wool

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.429 
a lot of builders will still use wool
and<00:01:51.450> stuff<00:01:51.659> like<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:52.020> but<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.290> good<00:01:52.380> thing

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
and stuff like that but the good thing

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.980 
and stuff like that but the good thing
about<00:01:52.619> this<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.310> it's<00:01:53.880> more<00:01:54.180> it's<00:01:54.450> stronger

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
about this is it's more it's stronger

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.440 
about this is it's more it's stronger
than<00:01:55.020> wool<00:01:55.380> so<00:01:55.619> won't<00:01:55.829> break<00:01:56.100> is<00:01:56.280> easy<00:01:56.549> or<00:01:57.060> blow

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
than wool so won't break is easy or blow

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.870 
than wool so won't break is easy or blow
up<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.719> easy<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.680> mess<00:01:59.009> up<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.280> lot<00:01:59.430> too<00:01:59.729> as

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
up is easy and I mess up a lot too as

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.370 
up is easy and I mess up a lot too as
well<00:02:00.060> but<00:02:00.299> yeah<00:02:00.450> I<00:02:00.689> think<00:02:01.020> this<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.170> gonna<00:02:01.290> be

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
well but yeah I think this is gonna be

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.080 
well but yeah I think this is gonna be
really<00:02:01.590> awesome<00:02:01.829> if<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.159> comes<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.549> us<00:02:02.610> our<00:02:02.850> con
