you're<00:00:29.850> really<00:00:30.090> just<00:00:30.240> doing<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.539> front<00:00:30.810> look

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:30.930 
you're really just doing a front look

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.170 
you're really just doing a front look
over<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.320> block<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:32.039> you're<00:00:32.579> assisting

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
over the block and you're assisting

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.729 
over the block and you're assisting
yourself<00:00:33.510> by<00:00:33.660> pushing<00:00:33.989> off<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.559> block

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
yourself by pushing off of the block

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.529 
yourself by pushing off of the block
it's<00:00:35.280> actually<00:00:35.609> easier<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:35.969> doing<00:00:36.269> just<00:00:36.449> a

00:00:36.529 --> 00:00:36.539 
it's actually easier to doing just a

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:38.209 
it's actually easier to doing just a
regular<00:00:36.870> standing<00:00:37.170> from<00:00:37.350> them<00:00:37.499> so<00:00:38.010> I'll<00:00:38.100> give

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
regular standing from them so I'll give

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:47.329 
regular standing from them so I'll give
you<00:00:38.280> an<00:00:38.370> example<00:00:38.609> on<00:00:38.789> that<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:46.100> good<00:00:47.100> thing<00:00:47.219> to

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:47.339 
you an example on that a good thing to

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:49.129 
you an example on that a good thing to
keep<00:00:47.370> in<00:00:47.550> mind<00:00:47.609> it<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.239> not<00:00:48.659> be<00:00:48.870> front

around on the conch front it's just like

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.799 
around on the conch front it's just like
a<00:00:55.109> pro<00:00:55.379> clip<00:00:55.649> where<00:00:56.190> you're<00:00:56.339> pushing<00:00:56.729> up<00:00:57.389> off

a pro clip where you're pushing up off
of<00:00:57.839> the<00:00:58.049> block<00:00:58.229> so<00:00:59.219> it's<00:00:59.399> not<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.850> front

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
really well before it's something that's

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.370 
really well before it's something that's
smooth<00:01:26.850> okay<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:27.899> there<00:01:28.200> are<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.320> few

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
smooth okay so there are a few

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.349 
smooth okay so there are a few
progressions<00:01:29.009> before<00:01:29.369> trying<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.880> confront

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:30.359

your double column okay so to start this
move<00:02:19.470> I<00:02:19.680> recommend<00:02:20.100> trying<00:02:20.250> it<00:02:20.430> on<00:02:20.520> something

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
move I recommend trying it on something

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.600 
move I recommend trying it on something
that's<00:02:21.030> short<00:02:21.240> with<00:02:21.750> no<00:02:22.050> gap<00:02:22.350> in<00:02:22.620> between<00:02:22.709> so

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
that's short with no gap in between so

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.890 
that's short with no gap in between so
if<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:23.880> don't<00:02:24.030> have<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:24.180> gym<00:02:24.420> which<00:02:24.600> blocks

if you don't have a gym which blocks

there's just double you need to be

able to double apply and see your body

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.610 
able to double apply and see your body
can<00:02:38.400> get<00:02:38.580> a<00:02:38.790> sense<00:02:39.239> of<00:02:39.390> how<00:02:39.600> far<00:02:39.900> it<00:02:40.020> is<00:02:40.140> the

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
can get a sense of how far it is the

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.170 
can get a sense of how far it is the
sense<00:02:40.800> of<00:02:40.860> how<00:02:40.980> much<00:02:41.100> power<00:02:41.400> you<00:02:41.640> need<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:41.970> jump

sense of how much power you need to jump

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.510 
sense of how much power you need to jump
into<00:02:42.390> it<00:02:42.630> once<00:02:43.530> you<00:02:43.650> get<00:02:43.770> a<00:02:43.800> good<00:02:43.950> feel<00:02:44.160> of<00:02:44.190> how

into it once you get a good feel of how

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.949 
into it once you get a good feel of how

much power you need to go over the

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.990 
much power you need to go over the
object<00:02:46.320> you<00:02:46.830> can<00:02:46.980> start<00:02:47.190> trying<00:02:47.459> to<00:02:47.520> come<00:02:47.730> from

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
object you can start trying to come from

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.199 
object you can start trying to come from
-<00:02:48.180> out<00:02:52.040> when<00:02:53.040> you<00:02:53.190> exit<00:02:53.550> the<00:02:53.670> move<00:02:53.850> when<00:02:54.120> you're

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
- out when you exit the move when you're

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.449 
- out when you exit the move when you're
doing<00:02:54.390> that<00:02:54.510> -<00:02:54.540> out<00:02:55.100> when<00:02:56.100> you're<00:02:56.220> halfway

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
doing that - out when you're halfway

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:57.860 
doing that - out when you're halfway
through<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.850> front<00:02:57.090> clip<00:02:57.269> you're<00:02:57.750> gonna

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
through the front clip you're gonna

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.780 
through the front clip you're gonna
reach<00:02:58.140> behind<00:02:58.470> you<00:02:58.830> and<00:02:59.010> feel<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.430> object

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
reach behind you and feel the object

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.030 
reach behind you and feel the object
with<00:02:59.910> your<00:03:00.060> hands<00:03:00.440> once<00:03:01.440> your<00:03:01.590> hands<00:03:01.799> get

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
with your hands once your hands get

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.400 
with your hands once your hands get
there<00:03:02.360> you're<00:03:03.360> gonna<00:03:03.480> try<00:03:03.660> to<00:03:03.690> hold<00:03:03.959> yourself

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
there you're gonna try to hold yourself

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.789 
there you're gonna try to hold yourself
up<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:04.860> let<00:03:05.280> your<00:03:05.400> body<00:03:05.549> finish<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.209> rotation

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
up and let your body finish the rotation

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.170 
up and let your body finish the rotation
so<00:03:07.799> you're<00:03:07.920> almost<00:03:08.040> gonna<00:03:08.280> catch<00:03:08.610> yourself<00:03:08.970> on

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
so you're almost gonna catch yourself on

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.150 
so you're almost gonna catch yourself on
your<00:03:09.330> hands<00:03:09.720> and<00:03:10.200> wait<00:03:10.410> for<00:03:10.680> your<00:03:10.739> feet<00:03:10.980> to

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
your hands and wait for your feet to

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.240 
your hands and wait for your feet to
come<00:03:11.370> down<00:03:11.580> and<00:03:12.120> then<00:03:12.269> do<00:03:12.390> the<00:03:12.540> -<00:03:12.690> ball<00:03:12.959> out<00:03:13.250> the

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
come down and then do the - ball out the

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.590 
come down and then do the - ball out the
sooner<00:03:14.519> you<00:03:14.670> get<00:03:14.790> your<00:03:14.940> hands<00:03:15.180> down<00:03:15.360> on<00:03:15.480> the

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
sooner you get your hands down on the

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.840 
sooner you get your hands down on the
object<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:16.080> safer<00:03:16.560> it's<00:03:16.650> gonna<00:03:16.799> be<00:03:17.010> if<00:03:17.610> you

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
object the safer it's gonna be if you

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.400 
object the safer it's gonna be if you
wait<00:03:18.030> too<00:03:18.239> long<00:03:18.269> to<00:03:18.420> eat<00:03:18.600> your<00:03:18.750> hands<00:03:18.930> down

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
wait too long to eat your hands down

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.530 
wait too long to eat your hands down
you<00:03:19.739> risk<00:03:19.980> crashing<00:03:20.519> your<00:03:20.640> tailbone<00:03:20.880> into<00:03:21.450> the

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
you risk crashing your tailbone into the

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.360 
you risk crashing your tailbone into the
end<00:03:21.720> of<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:21.900> object<00:03:22.230> which<00:03:22.799> would<00:03:23.100> be<00:03:23.220> bad

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
end of the object which would be bad

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.020 
end of the object which would be bad
obviously

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
obviously

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.850 
obviously
so<00:03:24.510> if<00:03:24.660> you<00:03:24.780> do<00:03:24.900> have<00:03:25.019> an<00:03:25.110> object<00:03:25.290> with<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.680> gap

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
so if you do have an object with the gap

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.500 
so if you do have an object with the gap
in<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.040> middle<00:03:26.280> like<00:03:26.760> I<00:03:26.880> said<00:03:27.060> before<00:03:27.180> make

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
in the middle like I said before make

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.970 
in the middle like I said before make
sure<00:03:27.540> you<00:03:27.750> double<00:03:27.989> Kong<00:03:28.260> it<00:03:28.440> first<00:03:28.650> so<00:03:28.799> you<00:03:28.890> get

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
sure you double Kong it first so you get

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.170 
sure you double Kong it first so you get
an<00:03:29.070> idea<00:03:29.130> of<00:03:29.340> how<00:03:29.459> much<00:03:29.580> power<00:03:29.820> it's<00:03:30.030> gonna

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
an idea of how much power it's gonna

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.539 
an idea of how much power it's gonna
take<00:03:30.420> to<00:03:30.570> get<00:03:30.690> over<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:31.080> object<00:03:31.440> so<00:03:32.340> things

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
take to get over the object so things

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.280 
take to get over the object so things
people<00:03:32.670> run<00:03:32.880> into<00:03:33.030> trouble<00:03:33.420> with<00:03:33.480> is<00:03:33.959> not

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
people run into trouble with is not

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.479 
people run into trouble with is not
getting<00:03:34.560> enough<00:03:34.739> power<00:03:34.890> off<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.220> initial

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
getting enough power off the initial

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.490 
getting enough power off the initial
Kong<00:03:35.820> front<00:03:36.120> flip<00:03:36.269> so<00:03:36.930> I<00:03:36.959> recommend<00:03:37.410> just

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
Kong front flip so I recommend just

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.560 
Kong front flip so I recommend just
practicing<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:38.250> conference<00:03:38.670> but<00:03:38.820> a<00:03:39.120> lot<00:03:39.540> of

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
practicing the conference but a lot of

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.960 
practicing the conference but a lot of
times<00:03:39.810> people<00:03:40.140> don't<00:03:40.290> get<00:03:40.440> enough<00:03:40.680> push<00:03:41.010> or

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
times people don't get enough push or

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.430 
times people don't get enough push or
they<00:03:42.239> treat<00:03:42.450> it<00:03:42.480> like<00:03:42.660> a<00:03:42.720> front<00:03:42.959> handspring

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
they treat it like a front handspring

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.340 
they treat it like a front handspring
make<00:03:43.769> sure<00:03:43.980> you<00:03:44.850> get<00:03:44.970> a<00:03:45.030> good<00:03:45.269> jump<00:03:45.570> and<00:03:46.260> you

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
make sure you get a good jump and you

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.560 
make sure you get a good jump and you
get<00:03:46.470> a<00:03:46.500> good<00:03:46.680> tug<00:03:46.980> and<00:03:47.220> as<00:03:47.459> you<00:03:47.700> tug<00:03:47.940> that's

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
get a good tug and as you tug that's

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.650 
get a good tug and as you tug that's
when<00:03:48.840> you<00:03:48.959> push<00:03:49.200> off<00:03:49.620> of<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:50.250> block<00:03:50.489> you<00:03:50.910> don't

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
when you push off of the block you don't

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.610 
when you push off of the block you don't
want<00:03:51.780> to<00:03:51.870> push

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
want to push

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.710 
want to push
