to<00:03:11.609> collect<00:03:11.790> data<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:12.299> use<00:03:12.569> it<00:03:12.720> to<00:03:12.810> come<00:03:12.959> up

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
to collect data and use it to come up

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.129 
to collect data and use it to come up
with<00:03:13.169> various<00:03:13.650> possible<00:03:14.159> battle<00:03:14.549> strategies

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:15.139 
with various possible battle strategies

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:19.099 
with various possible battle strategies
but<00:03:16.139> first<00:03:16.590> scenario<00:03:17.329> battle<00:03:18.329> strategies<00:03:18.870> I

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
but first scenario battle strategies I

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.020 
but first scenario battle strategies I
figure<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.769> best<00:03:19.980> strategies<00:03:20.609> to<00:03:20.760> increase

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
figure the best strategies to increase

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.580 
figure the best strategies to increase
the<00:03:21.180> power<00:03:21.359> level<00:03:21.720> of<00:03:21.810> your<00:03:21.930> team<00:03:22.200> don't<00:03:22.470> you

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
the power level of your team don't you

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.199 
the power level of your team don't you
think<00:03:22.919> there's<00:03:23.340> more<00:03:23.400> to<00:03:23.609> it<00:03:23.730> than<00:03:23.939> that

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
think there's more to it than that

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.539 
think there's more to it than that
if<00:03:24.480> your<00:03:24.689> counter<00:03:25.139> ability<00:03:25.620> is<00:03:25.769> set<00:03:26.010> then<00:03:26.400> it's

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
if your counter ability is set then it's

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.219 
if your counter ability is set then it's
possible<00:03:26.760> to<00:03:27.180> defeat<00:03:27.479> even<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:27.930> strongest

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:28.229 
possible to defeat even the strongest

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:31.039 
possible to defeat even the strongest
enemy<00:03:28.859> with<00:03:29.010> less<00:03:29.250> power<00:03:29.519> than<00:03:29.790> him<00:03:30.030> what<00:03:30.780> are

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
enemy with less power than him what are

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:31.759 
enemy with less power than him what are
