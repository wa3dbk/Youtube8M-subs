00:00:09.479 --> 00:00:12.899
 as for the welcome round always reborn with the team that dealt with 

00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:16.009
 is always discovering the different parts of this game in 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:19.429
 the occurrence we will go into the player creation tool since in top 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:20.400
 spin 4 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.550
 you can pursue a career you have to create a player from scratch 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.679
 leave to evolve on a drunk woman 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:29.929
 evolution is done counter the machos creates workouts and you go 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.380
 to be able to improve each compartment 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.730
 of the game that interests you to create a 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.610
 an avatar that looks like you 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.180
 or no where else you will have the choice for that we will be interested in the heart of 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.640
 career mode a little bit later 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.250
 for now in the rout the creations of players 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.640
 you have any politics in it either trying to make you an avatar that you 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.359
 looks as much as possible - site 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:52.150
 rather the orientation that I have so now in prison 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.040
 date of birth cap and membership and its lands 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.190
 and we'll start with the archetypes so the most obvious things 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.330
 as to whether you have a type of race 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.100
 the white euro capsule where went from 6 years earlier 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.180
 so you really have what to match 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.230
 hahaha a player from anywhere on the planet 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.750
 you have face shapes too that are related to each type of skin you 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.240
 would have chosen that it's really 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.600
 the the generic 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.570
 we found ourselves 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.430
 more in detail by personalizing the the face 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.650
 as we could see a little change the drama to have a skin 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.110
 more or less clear 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.200
 for the deposit more or less happy britney more or less agitated 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.020
 change the shape of reprieve the color of the eyes 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.620
 concluding you have some this little example of what we can do 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.190
 all of these are things that are for 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.040
 proposed in programmed loan between estimated 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.240
 and every element of the face you will be able to come to make you avatar 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.070
 was not possible with a pretty huge nose 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.660
 both in width curran big heart 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.590
 still changed its position to change your mind - so you're not 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.590
 it's really already standard 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.730
 a lot of customization options you can do things that 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.730
 perfectly matches your face 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.210
 the eyes are the same 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.860
 to change their spacing their positions down this rare too late 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.229
 for forgery all that is pretty obvious 

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:16.129
 the same for the mouth with the thickness of the lips go up 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:17.059
 go down 

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:20.649
 all that is not precise enough and it allows to do something differently 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.809
 to personalize 

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:26.299
 your quotes quickly on the front 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.069
 it's the same thing if you want flowers 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.799
 a broad front like an airport that's your problem 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:33.690
 and there is also that so it's the editor 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.029
 for me these experts 

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:38.400
 I told you on one point this 3d model I guess there is a 

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:40.059
 denomination 

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:44.459
 particular for this system a points system because the site the 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.030
 3d modeling on general bridges that define 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.100
 the edges of the face alas as you can see in could really 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.890
 change the shape of the face 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.209
 very precisely here again to make you 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:56.639
 the player 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:00.229
 the most like the club more according to your wishes the ball that goes up that 

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:03.229
 goes down that does the essence on the apple no 

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:05.719
 we continue 

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:09.450
 with this time good you have the general morphology unless we 

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:11.059
 wanted to make a house 

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:14.369
 practices and norms that got the crazy visit then 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.120
 a little guy who runs in every sense of the room style for example 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.319
 can you do it too 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.189
 you have all the sartorial attributes that are editable to 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:25.680
 will with a wide choice of equipment that is already at the start 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.910
 knowing that this choice will not expand a little bit thereafter 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.569
 because you will win 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.849
 by participating in certain types of tournaments new sponsors who are going 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:35.889
 propose new types of material 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:39.439
 so where can you do in wardrobe which has nothing to throw unlike 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:41.909
 to previous versions or so I do not know if I confuse with virtua 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:45.129
 tennis in any case no point system to buy 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:48.920
 you hit you can absolutely put you what you want the snowshoes 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:51.699
 separate you have the major OEMs that are present 

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:55.329
 yet we moved quickly on the hair nature and the beard of three 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:55.989
 days 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.639
 all these are things that for sure a little trivial 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:01.819
 much more interesting tired of personalizing a little bit more 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:03.599
 players according to your style 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.819
 it's a right-handed or left-handed charges 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.819
 I am right handed I am proud and a setback to a hand no I went from 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:09.179
 all 

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:11.519
 setback to tomorrow proposed as standard 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.879
 from the backhand to tomorrow proposed as standard or one-handed backhand 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.780
 and you change a little bit salsa animations that I find 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.319
 service animation animation of backhand forehand 

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:24.009
 and the position of expectations contest you expect that your opponent certainly 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.449
 I think you do not do enough animations for my taste because 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:29.699
 of style 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:32.699
 which are much more varied than that and here a little bit for 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.509
 and I think it's a flaw we're likely to find for all 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:39.279
 players who are said to be standard 

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:42.159
 that is to say, that will miss a little bit of variety even if the players 

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:43.169
 the most famous 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:47.920
 his work well modeled and shameless and signature particular moves 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.860
 the players are in my neighborhood all in excess of indebtedness 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.449
 so the attitude level device see the temperament that goes a little 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:57.930
 little conditioning to one the movements we will see the player who will win a 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.240
 pot paying will lose 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.249
 the grunts 

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:03.689
 so the v6 that compromised a blow really very strong for example in fact 

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:04.860
 you let go a little bit 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.590
 can define the type of project moa no 3 is really not much 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.090
 but the frequency furrows chf rap grunts if if that's 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.919
 only when it's a powerful strike 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:18.139
 I love it in powerful strikes because it allows me to know precisely if 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:20.870
 I perfectly managed my shot and if it was powerful 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.560
 after you have more than save that in one of four locations that 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.450
 are available 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.970
 that means it's not a little imitation what you see you can 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.300
 develop after 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.749
 help start your career mode 

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:35.409
 here you see it's a big effort yesterday the game is late in south nawa 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:38.499
 at apple knew if i'm going to create a great player it was very 

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:41.289
 difficult and I immediately report success is over for this 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:43.609
 very soon for our video on spin 4
