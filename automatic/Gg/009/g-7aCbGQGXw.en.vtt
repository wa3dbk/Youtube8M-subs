00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.120 
and stuff like that so as you can see i
did<00:01:14.000> it<00:01:14.119> first<00:01:14.299> try<00:01:14.570> and<00:01:14.810> it's<00:01:15.439> really<00:01:15.500> easy<00:01:15.710> to

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
did it first try and it's really easy to

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.649 
did it first try and it's really easy to
do<00:01:16.280> most<00:01:16.579> the<00:01:16.670> time<00:01:16.909> it<00:01:17.119> does<00:01:17.270> take<00:01:17.420> a<00:01:17.450> bit<00:01:17.600> of

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
do most the time it does take a bit of

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:19.420 
do most the time it does take a bit of
timing<00:01:18.049> to<00:01:18.140> do<00:01:18.290> and<00:01:18.500> there<00:01:19.009> can<00:01:19.159> be<00:01:19.189> a<00:01:19.310> bit

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
timing to do and there can be a bit

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.560 
timing to do and there can be a bit
frustrating<00:01:19.909> at<00:01:20.030> times<00:01:20.060> when<00:01:20.420> you<00:01:20.509> were

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570
