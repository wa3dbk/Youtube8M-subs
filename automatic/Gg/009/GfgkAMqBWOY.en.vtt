00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.670
 Hello and welcome to 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:11.040
 rapid- I'm just taking mine 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:15.660
 camera that everyone adds normally so far 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:19.439
 I stand and today I give you 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.170
 once again a tip and do it 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:26.189
 i just like that video after video 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.220
 I did the care video how to 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:33.450
 the screw twists immediately afterwards 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:37.110
 after the ride yes I have now once 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.300
 covered two cars and show you 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.399
 again my cars are there and you 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.950
 see you soon 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:46.260
 they are so tall they are now 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.190
 city ​​they grow up 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.680
 that's why I do not need a normal box 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.410
 and today and in this tip video is going 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.760
 it's because you do not tire yourselves 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.260
 broken power and really only if that 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.159
 car is that you can not 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.010
 broken power and that should rather be so 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.600
 put a box underneath 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.090
 then the tires are not so pure 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.430
 press and then a little to and 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.720
 maybe it will decide then 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.740
 was at the crossing in the long time and the 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.049
 actually already 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.990
 the tip is actually everyone 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.380
 car with me so that could be mine now 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.909
 But father, for example, where there have 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.689
 I'm a bit of a crash 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:37.740
 brought together the 01 and that stands 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:42.090
 but we believe we have 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:48.930
 a farmer because the gear is for them 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:52.380
 you get cheap and my renault 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:57.420
 I think that's mine, that's mine 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:03.780
 I never have the drive, I think so 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:07.229
 once said simply because and against that 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:12.170
 she sits down and the gear free 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:16.890
 but is so plastic dummy 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:21.150
 the flier no reader that that 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.880
 does not have to play like that but for that 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.510
 that is very important here you can see that 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:31.560
 nice the gap between in the council and 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.180
 its fathers to day yes I do that 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.280
 At every car I can only 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.790
 recommend this is a small tip 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.790
 once again 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:47.580
 I also have such an entry is actually 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:49.700
 my brother is still a lot of money 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.560
 tasted 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.800
 yes from my father is also the hobby 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:59.730
 That's why he likes to build his own model 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.130
 that I was with cars manager too 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.470
 like to 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:09.110
 That's why I have so many cars 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:12.870
 simply because yes also makes model construction and 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.519
 then here I have aviators too 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.980
 once said in a video how many 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:22.049
 aviators stand and everything so the whole 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.450
 I would still cover with one 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:27.840
 cloth or with the plastic wrap the 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:33.209
 material that the whole is not dusty 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:35.220
 and stop the car beautiful remains one 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:39.840
 we do not see that because of the passion 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:44.100
 Next to the video is so yes 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:47.519
 the video is already over and me 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:51.840
 Hope you have fallen deeply and me 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:53.459
 Hope he does it sometimes too 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.750
 do not tell you you know it 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:58.410
 probably that my 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:04.670
 then imagine but once the shine 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.670
 the video for the beginners and you 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:11.489
 and i like to play with the camera 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:15.890
 because I want this brand new one too 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.890
 like to make for example 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.560
 so the offender climbed says yes that's it 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.390
 the video I think the cars now 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:31.680
 again with this through with this one 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:34.690
 plastic packaging material that 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.530
 still so cheap, if known, the 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:42.420
 do not use throw away 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:46.060
 but my cellar at all very much 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:48.340
 Do not cry together and see here 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.820
 we still struggle, maybe I would 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:54.250
 one day fly and 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.560
 Maybe somebody will feel it when I am 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.240
 war but my father said we are 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.950
 not yet fly a bit too 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.140
 heavy 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:04.750
 simply because he is a pc controversial 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:07.630
 maybe you can think now 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:11.170
 the macro master and that I can 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.790
 might fly but have two so 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:16.390
 one more will come one more 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.290
 are Bavarian on board but they 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:21.690
 not on board 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:24.280
 yes she was back in masters video 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:27.430
 should actually be short on such a small one 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:31.530
 Tip and once I'll show you yet 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:38.260
 I'm so far away with that 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:43.650
 Now we are looking for this cinema 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:43.650
 lenz on this tolerance packaging 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:53.750
 or there on this wood there you can see 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:58.430
 already it is going very well I was ready 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:06:00.590
 I can remove and just go there 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:05.360
 only recommend who youtube videos 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:07.880
 also likes to do strange things but that was 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.070
 already with the me i hope i had 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:16.780
 the feeling of projection so long for 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:16.780
 farewell yes this year rapids
