00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
right going up this ladder again that's

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:09.339 
right going up this ladder again that's
usually<00:05:06.530> what<00:05:06.650> I<00:05:06.680> do<00:05:06.770> as<00:05:07.039> you<00:05:07.220> can<00:05:07.370> see<00:05:08.349> because

I'll probably just go around I usually

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.830 
I'll probably just go around I usually
check<00:05:15.199> in<00:05:15.379> their<00:05:15.500> base<00:05:15.710> 20<00:05:16.870> go<00:05:17.870> on<00:05:18.050> behind<00:05:18.229> me<00:05:18.530> I

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 
he'll probably turn around and get me up

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:29.559 
he'll probably turn around and get me up
here<00:05:27.949> in<00:05:28.220> a<00:05:28.280> second<00:05:28.699> because<00:05:28.819> that's<00:05:29.300> what<00:05:29.479> he
