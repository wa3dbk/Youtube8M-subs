00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
problems with the power steering pump

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.419 
problems with the power steering pump
it's<00:00:07.259> actually<00:00:07.560> making<00:00:07.740> a<00:00:07.950> noise<00:00:08.160> like

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
it's actually making a noise like

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:09.950 
it's actually making a noise like
there's<00:00:08.730> air<00:00:08.910> in<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.150> system<00:00:09.540> and<00:00:09.719> there<00:00:09.809> is

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
there's air in the system and there is

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.770 
there's air in the system and there is
only<00:00:10.500> one<00:00:10.740> is<00:00:10.980> cold<00:00:11.340> on<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:12.150> normal<00:00:12.389> temperature

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
only one is cold on a normal temperature

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.079 
only one is cold on a normal temperature
day<00:00:13.290> it<00:00:14.009> doesn't<00:00:14.340> really<00:00:14.460> happen<00:00:14.700> it<00:00:14.969> only

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089

day it doesn't really happen it only
happens<00:00:15.389> when<00:00:15.480> they're<00:00:15.630> cold<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:16.049> when<00:00:16.139> their

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
happens when they're cold and when their

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.519 
happens when they're cold and when their
car<00:00:16.410> warms<00:00:16.740> up<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.220> problems<00:00:17.609> go<00:00:17.789> away

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:18.529 
car warms up the problems go away

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:21.830 
car warms up the problems go away
what<00:00:19.529> it<00:00:19.650> is<00:00:19.770> is<00:00:20.070> after<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.699> quick<00:00:21.029> check<00:00:21.539> on<00:00:21.720> the

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
what it is is after a quick check on the

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.170 
what it is is after a quick check on the
internet<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.199> found<00:00:22.500> that<00:00:22.619> there's<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.890> TSB<00:00:23.460> for

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
internet I found that there's a TSB for

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.599 
internet I found that there's a TSB for
this<00:00:24.330> car<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.260> maybe<00:00:25.590> it's<00:00:25.740> possibility<00:00:26.430> some

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
this car and maybe it's possibility some

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.609 
this car and maybe it's possibility some
other<00:00:26.789> handles<00:00:27.240> too<00:00:27.449> in<00:00:27.660> different<00:00:28.080> years<00:00:28.289> but

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
other handles too in different years but

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.589 
other handles too in different years but
what<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.310> there's<00:00:29.730> all<00:00:30.000> ring<00:00:30.210> here<00:00:30.449> on

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
what it is is there's all ring here on

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.990 
what it is is there's all ring here on
this<00:00:30.720> inlet<00:00:31.230> hose<00:00:31.560> where<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.489> sits<00:00:32.700> here

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
this inlet hose where it sits here

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.139 
this inlet hose where it sits here
inside<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.410> ring<00:00:34.649> goes<00:00:34.829> bad<00:00:35.130> or<00:00:35.399> it's<00:00:36.030> the

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
inside the ring goes bad or it's the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.030 
inside the ring goes bad or it's the
wrong<00:00:36.270> part<00:00:36.630> number<00:00:36.930> or<00:00:36.960> whatever<00:00:37.230> they

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
wrong part number or whatever they

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.410 
wrong part number or whatever they
revised<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.700> part<00:00:38.910> number<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.300> it's

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
revised the part number and it's

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.720 
revised the part number and it's
actually<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.750> different<00:00:40.140> part<00:00:40.350> now<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:41.520> it's

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
actually a different part now so it's

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.880 
actually a different part now so it's
real<00:00:41.879> simple<00:00:42.120> job<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.780> I'll<00:00:43.200> just<00:00:43.590> change

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
real simple job and I'll just change

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.549 
real simple job and I'll just change
that<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.789> should<00:00:45.000> be<00:00:45.090> good<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.390> go<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.930> on

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
that and should be good to go and on

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.260 
that and should be good to go and on
some<00:00:46.739> other<00:00:46.829> some<00:00:47.550> phones<00:00:47.760> might<00:00:48.000> be<00:00:48.149> you

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
some other some phones might be you

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.510 
some other some phones might be you
might<00:00:48.450> have<00:00:48.600> air<00:00:48.870> bubbles<00:00:49.289> in<00:00:49.440> here<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.890> if

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
might have air bubbles in here and if

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.189 
might have air bubbles in here and if
you<00:00:50.610> take<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.820> look<00:00:51.000> at<00:00:51.180> this<00:00:51.360> reservoir<00:00:51.989> here

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
you take a look at this reservoir here

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.020 
you take a look at this reservoir here
you<00:00:52.440> can<00:00:52.559> see<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.860> was<00:00:53.010> leaking<00:00:53.309> out<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.640> the

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
you can see that was leaking out and the

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.970 
you can see that was leaking out and the
level<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.480> fine<00:00:54.780> what<00:00:55.320> was<00:00:55.440> happening<00:00:55.890> is

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
level is fine what was happening is

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.799 
level is fine what was happening is
though<00:00:56.190> air<00:00:56.460> was<00:00:56.670> getting<00:00:56.940> into<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.449> liquid

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
though air was getting into the liquid

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.049 
though air was getting into the liquid
into<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.350> fluid<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:59.100> was<00:00:59.250> actually<00:00:59.550> foaming

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
into the fluid it was actually foaming

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.360 
into the fluid it was actually foaming
up<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.390> coming<00:01:00.690> out<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.680> if<00:01:02.190> you're

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
up and coming out and if you're

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.799 
up and coming out and if you're
experiencing<00:01:02.969> these<00:01:03.239> symptoms

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
experiencing these symptoms

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.299 
experiencing these symptoms
I<00:01:03.930> would<00:01:04.199> definitely<00:01:04.559> change<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.890> o-ring

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
I would definitely change the o-ring

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.880 
I would definitely change the o-ring
there's<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.670> real<00:01:05.850> chimp<00:01:06.119> um<00:01:06.380> she<00:01:07.380> Parton<00:01:07.770> it

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
there's a real chimp um she Parton it

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:31.300 
there's a real chimp um she Parton it
simple<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.310> change

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:44.359 

you

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.859 

the<00:01:45.369> first<00:01:45.609> step<00:01:45.789> in<00:01:45.939> removing<00:01:46.119> is<00:01:46.509> over<00:01:46.810> it

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
the first step in removing is over it

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.679 
the first step in removing is over it
means<00:01:47.079> I'm<00:01:47.380> going<00:01:47.530> to<00:01:47.619> take<00:01:47.740> some<00:01:47.950> rags<00:01:48.689> I'm

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
means I'm going to take some rags I'm

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:50.999 
means I'm going to take some rags I'm
going<00:01:49.869> to<00:01:49.929> stick<00:01:50.170> them<00:01:50.289> underneath<00:01:50.560> the<00:01:50.649> holes

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
going to stick them underneath the holes

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:52.940 
going to stick them underneath the holes
where<00:01:51.340> it<00:01:51.429> goes<00:01:51.520> to<00:01:51.700> a<00:01:51.729> power<00:01:51.969> steering<00:01:52.240> pump

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
where it goes to a power steering pump

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.289 
where it goes to a power steering pump
so<00:01:53.950> when<00:01:54.100> I<00:01:54.130> have<00:01:54.280> when<00:01:54.399> it<00:01:54.549> leaks<00:01:54.729> out<00:01:55.000> it

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
so when I have when it leaks out it

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:58.490 
so when I have when it leaks out it
doesn't<00:01:55.630> get<00:01:55.719> all<00:01:55.840> over<00:01:55.869> the<00:01:56.170> felt<00:01:56.380> and

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
doesn't get all over the felt and

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:05.490 
doesn't get all over the felt and
there's<00:01:59.500> connectors<00:02:00.039> like<00:02:03.719> that<00:02:04.719> so<00:02:05.380> that

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
there's connectors like that so that

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.809 
there's connectors like that so that
you're<00:02:05.619> still<00:02:05.799> able<00:02:05.920> to<00:02:06.069> get<00:02:06.369> to<00:02:06.490> this<00:02:06.579> 10

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:06.819 
you're still able to get to this 10

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:10.139 
you're still able to get to this 10
millimeter<00:02:07.299> bolt<00:02:07.750> down<00:02:07.959> here<00:02:08.789> which<00:02:09.789> is<00:02:09.819> real

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
millimeter bolt down here which is real

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.430 
millimeter bolt down here which is real
tight<00:02:10.420> I'm<00:02:10.660> just<00:02:10.810> going<00:02:10.929> to<00:02:10.959> use<00:02:11.140> a<00:02:11.170> regular

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
tight I'm just going to use a regular

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.630 
tight I'm just going to use a regular
open<00:02:11.950> end<00:02:12.129> wrench<00:02:14.069> see<00:02:15.069> if<00:02:15.160> I<00:02:15.250> can<00:02:15.400> crack<00:02:15.610> it

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
open end wrench see if I can crack it

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:34.800 
open end wrench see if I can crack it
loose<00:02:15.940> with<00:02:16.150> this<00:02:33.269> but<00:02:34.269> you<00:02:34.390> get<00:02:34.540> a<00:02:34.569> crack

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
loose with this but you get a crack

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
damaging that surface so you got to be

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.690 
damaging that surface so you got to be
gentle<00:03:19.720> just<00:03:20.720> try<00:03:20.989> to<00:03:21.049> get<00:03:21.260> it<00:03:21.379> out<00:03:21.530> just<00:03:22.489> like

gentle just try to get it out just like
so<00:03:22.970> and<00:03:23.680> I<00:03:24.680> can<00:03:24.860> tell<00:03:25.099> that<00:03:25.970> this<00:03:26.150> is<00:03:26.360> the<00:03:26.540> old

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:26.659 
so and I can tell that this is the old

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:28.690 
so and I can tell that this is the old
one<00:03:26.840> because<00:03:27.170> it's<00:03:27.349> black<00:03:27.620> and<00:03:27.950> a<00:03:28.220> new<00:03:28.370> part

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
one because it's black and a new part

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.180 
one because it's black and a new part
it's<00:03:29.150> actually<00:03:29.540> a<00:03:29.569> red<00:03:29.840> overing<00:03:30.260> so<00:03:30.739> if<00:03:30.980> you

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
it's actually a red overing so if you

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.860 
it's actually a red overing so if you
take<00:03:31.400> this<00:03:31.549> out<00:03:31.700> on<00:03:31.760> this<00:03:31.909> black<00:03:32.209> well<00:03:32.599> then<00:03:32.750> it

take this out on this black well then it

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.690 
take this out on this black well then it
