by coincidence he landed on this island

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.400 
by coincidence he landed on this island
and<00:03:27.440> he<00:03:27.890> was<00:03:28.040> like<00:03:28.160> this<00:03:28.430> is<00:03:28.730> fate<00:03:29.269> so<00:03:29.989> his<00:03:30.170> crew

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410
