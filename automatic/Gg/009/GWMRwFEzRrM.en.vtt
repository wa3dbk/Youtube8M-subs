00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:07.850
 test for the exhaust pipe of 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:10.500
 ventral position of the pulsar 200 ms 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:15.019
 This is a channel used to test 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.019
 the ability of the bike to wade through water 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.849
 said channel has been filled up to a 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.430
 Depth of 41 centimeters 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:28.289
 approximately to the knee with the 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:31.949
 intention to replicate a flooded area 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:35.699
 test 1 ride the motorcycle through the 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.980
 water in this test the motorcycle slips to 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:40.110
 through the canal full of water to the 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.670
 knees at a speed of 15 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:47.679
 kilometers per hour 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:50.050
 test 2 idle on the water the pilot 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:51.760
 goes through water to the knees of 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.010
 has the motorbike leaving the engine at 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.440
 idle for a while and reassemble 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:00.909
 without any problem 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:03.010
 Test 3 stop and start in the water the 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:05.890
 pilot leaves the bike in the water and turns off 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:10.500
 the engine after a few minutes the 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.500
 engine restarts and the brand resumes 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.840
 Test 4 standing in the water for 30 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.840
 minutes 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.220
 the pilot leaves the motorcycle in the water and 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.220
 turn off the engine 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:38.020
 the motorcycle remains in water until the 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.020
 knees for about 30 minutes 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.900
 then it restarts easily as it 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.020
 You can see in all the tests 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.880
 the press 200 ms to easily 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.860
 through the water while still functioning 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:55.190
 under any condition 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.590
 pressing 200 ms is a new bike 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.570
 generation with advanced design and 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.310
 technology like the exhaust pipe of 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.590
 ventral position from the 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.320
 Exhaust pipe characteristics up 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.080
 his exhausted type technology everything has been 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:13.270
 carefully designed and tested to 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.270
 ensure superior performance
