00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.460 

we've<00:00:04.850> come<00:00:05.030> up<00:00:05.060> with<00:00:05.180> some<00:00:05.420> new<00:00:05.510> designs<00:00:05.840> for

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:06.470 
we've come up with some new designs for

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.940 
we've come up with some new designs for
our<00:00:07.390> CNC<00:00:08.390> cutter<00:00:08.720> here<00:00:08.990> making<00:00:09.470> some<00:00:09.500> kids

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:09.950 
our CNC cutter here making some kids

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.680 
our CNC cutter here making some kids
play<00:00:10.250> houses<00:00:10.700> and<00:00:10.880> things<00:00:11.030> like<00:00:11.269> that

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690 
play houses and things like that

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.450 
play houses and things like that
so<00:00:12.200> first<00:00:12.500> of<00:00:12.620> all<00:00:12.650> the<00:00:12.770> machines<00:00:13.130> going

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:13.460 
so first of all the machines going

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.060 
so first of all the machines going
around<00:00:14.020> embossing<00:00:15.020> where<00:00:15.680> we're<00:00:15.890> going<00:00:16.010> to

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
around embossing where we're going to

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.939 
around embossing where we're going to
make<00:00:16.400> the<00:00:16.609> folds<00:00:17.090> in<00:00:17.300> this<00:00:17.449> model<00:00:17.869> and<00:00:18.289> then

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:18.949 
make the folds in this model and then

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:21.040 
make the folds in this model and then
we'll<00:00:19.130> go<00:00:19.310> around<00:00:19.430> and<00:00:19.760> cut<00:00:20.089> all<00:00:20.419> the<00:00:20.570> external

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
we'll go around and cut all the external

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.159 
we'll go around and cut all the external
pieces<00:00:21.710> so<00:00:22.009> that's<00:00:22.730> gonna<00:00:23.029> change<00:00:23.329> heads<00:00:23.839> in<00:00:24.079> a

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:24.169 
pieces so that's gonna change heads in a

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:27.249 
pieces so that's gonna change heads in a
second<00:00:24.789> we've<00:00:25.789> come<00:00:26.029> in<00:00:26.210> now<00:00:26.449> to<00:00:26.689> actually

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:27.259 
second we've come in now to actually

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:34.360 
second we've come in now to actually
come<00:00:27.499> into<00:00:27.859> the<00:00:32.620> and<00:00:33.620> that's<00:00:33.800> cutting<00:00:34.190> really

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
come into the and that's cutting really

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.220 
come into the and that's cutting really
quite<00:00:34.700> fluidly<00:00:37.300> and<00:00:38.300> this<00:00:38.570> the<00:00:38.840> beauty<00:00:39.140> of

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
quite fluidly and this the beauty of

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.529 
quite fluidly and this the beauty of
this<00:00:39.379> design<00:00:39.890> is<00:00:40.280> we've<00:00:40.489> made<00:00:40.760> it<00:00:40.969> so<00:00:41.210> that<00:00:41.239> we

00:00:41.529 --> 00:00:41.539 
this design is we've made it so that we

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:45.639 
this design is we've made it so that we
can<00:00:41.690> actually<00:00:42.140> scale<00:00:43.070> it<00:00:43.129> to<00:00:43.550> any<00:00:44.239> size<00:00:44.629> so<00:00:45.559> at

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
can actually scale it to any size so at

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:47.740 
can actually scale it to any size so at
the<00:00:45.800> moment<00:00:45.980> I'm<00:00:46.340> making<00:00:46.730> a<00:00:46.820> small<00:00:47.149> castle

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
the moment I'm making a small castle

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.319 
the moment I'm making a small castle
that's<00:00:47.899> going<00:00:48.289> to<00:00:48.440> be<00:00:48.590> about<00:00:48.730> or<00:00:50.949> maybe<00:00:51.949> about

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
that's going to be about or maybe about

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:55.630 
that's going to be about or maybe about
1200<00:00:53.329> square<00:00:53.649> when<00:00:54.649> we<00:00:54.829> finally<00:00:55.309> put<00:00:55.519> the

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
1200 square when we finally put the

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.450 
1200 square when we finally put the
castle<00:00:56.089> together<00:00:56.269> but<00:00:57.230> what<00:00:57.410> we<00:00:57.559> can<00:00:57.890> do<00:00:58.129> is

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
castle together but what we can do is

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.270 
castle together but what we can do is
make<00:00:58.940> it<00:00:59.199> double<00:01:00.199> that<00:01:00.350> size<00:01:00.679> so<00:01:00.710> you<00:01:01.129> can

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
make it double that size so you can

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.759 
make it double that size so you can
actually<00:01:01.399> have<00:01:01.730> a<00:01:02.019> kid<00:01:03.019> can<00:01:03.260> play<00:01:03.379> in<00:01:03.649> the

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
actually have a kid can play in the

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:06.700 
actually have a kid can play in the
cider<00:01:04.070> and<00:01:04.990> we're<00:01:05.990> starting<00:01:06.320> to<00:01:06.380> get<00:01:06.500> quite

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
cider and we're starting to get quite

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.840 
cider and we're starting to get quite
excited<00:01:07.160> about<00:01:07.460> making<00:01:08.270> large<00:01:09.850> children's

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
excited about making large children's

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.749 
excited about making large children's
play<00:01:11.210> furniture<00:01:12.200> and<00:01:13.540> party<00:01:14.540> props<00:01:14.869> for

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
play furniture and party props for

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:22.289 
play furniture and party props for
birthday<00:01:16.759> parties<00:01:17.150> and<00:01:17.299> things<00:01:17.509> like<00:01:17.720> that

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:33.340 

okay<00:01:30.460> so<00:01:31.460> basically<00:01:31.780> this<00:01:32.780> is<00:01:32.960> going<00:01:33.110> to<00:01:33.200> be

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
okay so basically this is going to be

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.499 
okay so basically this is going to be
our<00:01:34.119> Castle<00:01:35.200> suckering<00:01:36.200> that<00:01:36.409> in<00:01:36.670> and<00:01:37.670> it

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
our Castle suckering that in and it

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:44.230 
our Castle suckering that in and it
should<00:01:38.840> slot<00:01:39.350> in<00:01:40.240> quite<00:01:41.240> smoothly

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.849 

this<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.390> actually<00:01:45.719> far<00:01:45.990> easier<00:01:46.259> than<00:01:46.560> the

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:46.859 
this is actually far easier than the

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:51.560 
this is actually far easier than the
other<00:01:47.009> fold<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.700> we<00:01:47.880> had<00:01:49.700> locks<00:01:50.700> in<00:01:51.000> nicely

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
other fold that we had locks in nicely

00:01:51.570 --> 00:02:05.569 
other fold that we had locks in nicely
there<00:02:01.969> this<00:02:02.969> will<00:02:03.209> join<00:02:03.920> there's<00:02:04.920> basically<00:02:05.549> a

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
there this will join there's basically a

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.139 
there this will join there's basically a
small<00:02:05.969> castle<00:02:06.719> at<00:02:06.869> this<00:02:07.049> stage<00:02:08.060> that'll<00:02:09.060> be

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
small castle at this stage that'll be

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.140 
small castle at this stage that'll be
one<00:02:09.330> side<00:02:09.660> of<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.929> castle<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.619> then<00:02:11.549> you<00:02:11.970> can

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
one side of the castle and then you can

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.570 
one side of the castle and then you can
join<00:02:12.450> that<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:13.019> as<00:02:13.319> many<00:02:13.590> pieces<00:02:13.920> as<00:02:14.099> you<00:02:14.370> like

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
join that to as many pieces as you like

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.580 
join that to as many pieces as you like
so<00:02:14.849> you<00:02:14.940> can<00:02:15.000> make<00:02:15.239> a<00:02:15.269> very<00:02:15.540> large<00:02:15.870> structure

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
so you can make a very large structure

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.490 
so you can make a very large structure
we<00:02:17.340> can<00:02:17.489> have<00:02:17.640> a<00:02:17.670> small<00:02:18.090> one<00:02:18.269> like<00:02:18.569> that<00:02:18.840> now

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
we can have a small one like that now

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.080 
we can have a small one like that now
that<00:02:19.560> would<00:02:19.799> be<00:02:19.829> a<00:02:19.920> great<00:02:20.220> thing<00:02:20.250> for<00:02:20.549> any<00:02:20.880> kid

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
that would be a great thing for any kid

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.289 
that would be a great thing for any kid
to<00:02:21.239> play<00:02:21.390> with<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.900> decorate<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:23.120> this<00:02:24.120> is

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
to play with and decorate and this is

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:25.699 
to play with and decorate and this is
one<00:02:24.450> of<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.599> first<00:02:24.840> prototypes<00:02:25.410> that<00:02:25.530> we've

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
one of the first prototypes that we've

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:35.110 
one of the first prototypes that we've
made<00:02:25.920> on<00:02:26.040> our<00:02:26.130> new<00:02:26.340> machine

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.180 

you
