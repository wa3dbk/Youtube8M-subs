the<00:00:58.980> vibrations<00:01:00.829> we're<00:01:01.829> also<00:01:02.010> using<00:01:02.190> the

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
the vibrations we're also using the

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.729 
the vibrations we're also using the
amplifier<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:03.930> we've<00:01:04.260> built<00:01:04.439> for<00:01:04.619> this

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
amplifier that we've built for this

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.359 
amplifier that we've built for this
purpose<00:01:04.979> it's<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.400> low-pass<00:01:05.970> filter<00:01:06.600> that's

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
purpose it's a low-pass filter that's

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.770 
purpose it's a low-pass filter that's
adjustable<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:08.939> can<00:01:09.119> actually<00:01:09.360> change

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
adjustable so you can actually change

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.780 
adjustable so you can actually change

to whatever kind of accessories figured
right<00:01:15.090> now<00:01:15.270> we've<00:01:15.450> got<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.810> cutoff<00:01:16.140> set<00:01:16.380> at

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
right now we've got the cutoff set at

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.960 
right now we've got the cutoff set at
about<00:01:16.560> one<00:01:16.920> kilohertz<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:17.700> we're<00:01:17.850> only

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
about one kilohertz so we're only

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.810 
about one kilohertz so we're only
sending<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.990> low<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.740> mid-range<00:01:20.189> audio

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
sending the low to mid-range audio

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.730 
sending the low to mid-range audio
through<00:01:21.210> this<00:01:21.360> woofer<00:01:21.570> down<00:01:21.900> here<00:01:22.140> hey<00:01:22.590> can

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
through this woofer down here hey can

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.520 
through this woofer down here hey can
you<00:01:22.860> turn<00:01:23.100> off<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.479> that<00:01:24.479> no<00:01:24.720> not<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:25.049> start

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
you turn off the that no not that start

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.510 
you turn off the that no not that start
off<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.680> amp<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.009> swing<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.340> into<00:01:26.520> this<00:01:26.640> myself

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
off the amp to swing it into this myself

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.170 
off the amp to swing it into this myself
idea<00:01:29.520> what<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.880> sounds<00:01:30.090> like<00:01:30.150> without<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:32.180> the

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
idea what it sounds like without it the

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.780 
idea what it sounds like without it the
electrode<00:01:33.659> width<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.590> also<00:01:34.950> adjustable<00:01:35.070> so

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
electrode width is also adjustable so

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.249 
electrode width is also adjustable so
you<00:01:35.820> can<00:01:36.000> tune<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.450> for<00:01:36.479> different<00:01:36.720> flyback

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
you can tune it for different flyback

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.440 
you can tune it for different flyback
get<00:01:37.770> different<00:01:37.979> frequency<00:01:38.759> responses<00:01:39.270> with

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
get different frequency responses with

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.830 
get different frequency responses with
the<00:01:39.540> size<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:39.990> art<00:01:40.549> if<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.729> can<00:01:41.909> keep<00:01:42.150> it

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:55.940 

34<00:01:45.840> inches<00:01:53.869> all<00:01:54.869> right<00:01:55.020> was<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.260> function<00:01:55.860> of

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
34 inches all right was a function of

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.430 
34 inches all right was a function of
barking<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:56.820> if<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.540> want<00:01:57.720> to<00:01:57.750> longer<00:01:58.050> are<00:01:58.229> can

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
barking so if you want to longer are can

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.870 
barking so if you want to longer are can
use<00:01:58.560> our<00:01:59.360> and<00:02:00.680> currently<00:02:01.680> our<00:02:02.070> high<00:02:02.280> frequency

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
use our and currently our high frequency

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.400 
use our and currently our high frequency
response<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:03.479> somewhat<00:02:03.810> limited<00:02:03.840> just

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
response is somewhat limited just

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:05.960 
response is somewhat limited just
because<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.890> flyback<00:02:05.310> transformer<00:02:05.550> that

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
because of the flyback transformer that

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.440 
because of the flyback transformer that
we<00:02:06.090> source<00:02:06.530> we<00:02:07.530> just<00:02:08.250> ganked<00:02:08.820> this<00:02:09.030> out<00:02:09.240> of<00:02:09.360> a

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
we source we just ganked this out of a

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.690 
we source we just ganked this out of a
random<00:02:09.810> CRT<00:02:10.380> and<00:02:10.410> it's<00:02:10.679> not<00:02:11.039> exactly<00:02:11.489> high

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
random CRT and it's not exactly high

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.960 
random CRT and it's not exactly high
performance<00:02:12.300> so<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:13.380> functions<00:02:13.890> at<00:02:14.250> about<00:02:14.430> 25

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
performance so it functions at about 25

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.660 
performance so it functions at about 25
kilohertz<00:02:15.360> which<00:02:15.810> is<00:02:15.989> well<00:02:16.590> below<00:02:16.670> the

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
optimal frequency that you want for

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
actually reproducing audio which for the

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.870 
actually reproducing audio which for the
CD<00:02:22.380> is<00:02:22.650> 40<00:02:23.250> 41<00:02:23.660> but<00:02:24.660> as<00:02:25.410> for<00:02:25.920> you<00:02:26.430> know<00:02:26.550> just<00:02:26.760> the

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
CD is 40 41 but as for you know just the

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.340 
CD is 40 41 but as for you know just the
parts<00:02:27.120> that<00:02:27.150> we<00:02:27.300> had<00:02:27.450> lying<00:02:27.690> around<00:02:27.840> i<00:02:28.170> think

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
parts that we had lying around i think

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.600 
parts that we had lying around i think
it<00:02:28.470> does<00:02:28.709> pretty<00:02:29.280> well<00:02:30.860> so<00:02:31.860> I<00:02:31.890> distortions

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
it does pretty well so I distortions

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.910 
it does pretty well so I distortions

of<00:02:35.100> us<00:02:35.250> vocalist<00:02:35.730> popular<00:02:36.860> great<00:02:37.860> lessons<00:02:39.620> but

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
of us vocalist popular great lessons but

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.229 
of us vocalist popular great lessons but
as<00:02:40.860> soon<00:02:41.130> as<00:02:41.220> we<00:02:41.400> find<00:02:41.640> a<00:02:41.790> higher<00:02:42.030> frequency

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
as soon as we find a higher frequency

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.570 
as soon as we find a higher frequency
fly<00:02:43.200> back<00:02:43.410> uniform<00:02:43.920> where<00:02:44.040> we<00:02:44.130> can<00:02:44.310> swap<00:02:44.519> that

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
fly back uniform where we can swap that

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.820 
fly back uniform where we can swap that
right<00:02:44.970> out<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:45.510> just<00:02:45.900> written<00:02:46.260> pots<00:02:46.530> and

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
right out and just written pots and

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.210 
right out and just written pots and
it'll<00:02:47.519> be<00:02:47.580> good<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:47.820> go<00:02:48.590> we've<00:02:49.590> also<00:02:49.799> got<00:02:50.070> some

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
it'll be good to go we've also got some

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.600 
it'll be good to go we've also got some
problems<00:02:50.370> with<00:02:50.670> their<00:02:50.850> top<00:02:51.060> electrode<00:02:51.600> and<00:02:52.610> we

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
problems with their top electrode and we

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.970 
problems with their top electrode and we
believe<00:02:53.940> it's<00:02:54.120> steel<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:54.840> steel<00:02:55.470> doesn't

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
believe it's steel and steel doesn't

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.420 
believe it's steel and steel doesn't
really<00:02:59.480> applies<00:03:00.480> this<00:03:01.049> temperature<00:03:01.590> probably

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
really applies this temperature probably

really applies this temperature probably
close<00:03:02.880> to<00:03:02.910> I<00:03:04.430> don't<00:03:05.430> have<00:03:05.519> two<00:03:05.880> to<00:03:06.000> three

as<00:03:10.230> you<00:03:10.410> can<00:03:10.530> tell<00:03:10.590> it<00:03:10.920> just

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
as you can tell it just

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.990 
as you can tell it just
redhot<00:03:12.940> right<00:03:13.209> there<00:03:13.390> at<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:13.510> tip<00:03:13.750> but<00:03:15.000> we

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
redhot right there at the tip but we

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.729 
redhot right there at the tip but we
could<00:03:16.150> get<00:03:16.239> ahold<00:03:16.360> of<00:03:16.510> some<00:03:16.780> function<00:03:16.959> to<00:03:17.620> you

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
could get ahold of some function to you

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.110 
could get ahold of some function to you
for<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.040> lecture<00:03:18.190> the<00:03:18.459> probably<00:03:18.790> do<00:03:18.910> a<00:03:18.940> bit

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
for the lecture the probably do a bit

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.630 
for the lecture the probably do a bit
better<00:03:19.150> you<00:03:19.920> can<00:03:20.920> really<00:03:21.069> smell<00:03:21.160> the<00:03:21.400> ozone

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
better you can really smell the ozone

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.890 
better you can really smell the ozone
too<00:03:22.209> oh<00:03:22.510> yeah<00:03:23.879> only<00:03:24.879> there's<00:03:25.120> papa<00:03:25.390> lecture

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
too oh yeah only there's papa lecture

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.839 
too oh yeah only there's papa lecture
they<00:03:26.080> get<00:03:26.260> hot<00:03:26.709> for<00:03:27.280> the<00:03:27.400> negative<00:03:27.730> electrode

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849 
they get hot for the negative electrode

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:32.339 
they get hot for the negative electrode
if<00:03:28.239> we<00:03:28.330> lift<00:03:28.810> out<00:03:29.019> of<00:03:29.110> the<00:03:29.170> bottom<00:03:31.200> we're<00:03:32.200> not

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
if we lift out of the bottom we're not

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.670 
if we lift out of the bottom we're not
really<00:03:32.890> sure<00:03:32.980> why<00:03:33.370> but<00:03:33.819> the<00:03:34.680> positive

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
really sure why but the positive

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:42.119 
really sure why but the positive
electrode<00:03:40.349> very<00:03:41.349> cool<00:03:41.530> guys<00:03:41.709> what<00:03:42.010> do<00:03:42.069> you

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
professor that was guiding us on this

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.559 
professor that was guiding us on this
crab<00:03:48.880> by<00:03:49.239> guiding<00:03:49.690> in<00:03:49.989> quotation<00:03:51.209> we<00:03:52.209> call<00:03:52.450> it
