00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
north link on this system and was built

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.479 
north link on this system and was built
for<00:00:34.860> water<00:00:35.129> use<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.390> produce<00:00:36.660> power<00:00:37.489> now

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
for water use and to produce power now

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.430 
for water use and to produce power now
it<00:00:38.610> turns<00:00:38.850> out<00:00:39.150> that<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.540> water<00:00:39.809> was<00:00:40.260> not

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
it turns out that the water was not

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.430 
it turns out that the water was not
usable<00:00:40.980> from<00:00:41.339> this<00:00:41.519> lake<00:00:41.790> because<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.930> Brazos

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
usable from this lake because the Brazos

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.189 
usable from this lake because the Brazos
River<00:00:43.589> as<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.430> drains<00:00:44.970> through<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.659> Permian

River as it drains through the Permian
rocks<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:46.920> West<00:00:47.250> which<00:00:47.850> are<00:00:48.030> infused<00:00:48.720> with

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:49.019 
rocks to the West which are infused with

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.340 
rocks to the West which are infused with
salts<00:00:49.769> like<00:00:50.280> hay<00:00:50.549> light<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.119> gypsum<00:00:51.629> wash

salts like hay light and gypsum wash

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.289 
salts like hay light and gypsum wash
these<00:00:52.680> salts<00:00:53.070> down<00:00:53.250> into<00:00:53.549> the<00:00:53.670> lake<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.059> you

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:54.299 
these salts down into the lake and you

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:57.289 
these salts down into the lake and you
actually<00:00:54.510> get<00:00:55.049> a<00:00:55.260> very<00:00:55.619> salty<00:00:56.299> concentration

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:57.299 
actually get a very salty concentration

00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:00.350 
actually get a very salty concentration
of<00:00:57.449> water<00:00:57.629> here<00:00:58.100> the<00:00:59.100> truth<00:00:59.369> is<00:00:59.670> that<00:00:59.939> waters

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
of water here the truth is that waters

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.780 
of water here the truth is that waters
so<00:01:00.600> salty<00:01:01.110> that<00:01:01.290> the<00:01:01.739> local<00:01:02.159> towns<00:01:02.489> around

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
so salty that the local towns around

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.429 
so salty that the local towns around
here<00:01:03.180> actually<00:01:03.390> have<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.930> get<00:01:04.080> their<00:01:04.260> water

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
here actually have to get their water

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.950 
here actually have to get their water
either<00:01:04.949> from<00:01:05.309> other<00:01:05.519> lakes<00:01:05.880> or<00:01:06.360> from<00:01:06.689> wells

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
either from other lakes or from wells

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.260 
either from other lakes or from wells
because<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.740> water<00:01:08.010> here<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.520> too<00:01:08.729> salty<00:01:09.000> to

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
because the water here is too salty to

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.320 
because the water here is too salty to
drink<00:01:09.770> many<00:01:10.770> times<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.430> past<00:01:11.610> people<00:01:12.119> have

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
see that the Brazos River has cut down

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.840 
see that the Brazos River has cut down
through<00:02:39.990> those<00:02:40.170> lime<00:02:40.590> stones<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.370> current

200 feet of difference so after the lake
was<00:03:04.260> built<00:03:04.560> much<00:03:04.950> of<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.250> river<00:03:05.430> rooms

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
was built much of the river rooms

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.220 
was built much of the river rooms
flooded<00:03:06.000> but<00:03:06.390> there<00:03:06.540> are<00:03:06.600> many<00:03:06.720> places<00:03:07.020> where

flooded but there are many places where
you<00:03:07.440> can<00:03:07.709> still<00:03:07.890> see<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.550> 200-foot<00:03:09.420> limestone

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
you can still see the 200-foot limestone

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.690 
you can still see the 200-foot limestone
is<00:03:10.380> one<00:03:11.160> of<00:03:11.250> those<00:03:11.340> places<00:03:11.640> down<00:03:12.320> spill<00:03:13.320> with

is one of those places down spill with
keep<00:03:14.700> in<00:03:14.910> mind<00:03:15.209> that<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:15.870> dam<00:03:16.080> itself<00:03:16.350> is<00:03:17.040> 19

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
keep in mind that the dam itself is 19

so<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.459> rocks<00:03:23.700> you<00:03:23.850> see<00:03:23.940> around<00:03:24.360> the<00:03:24.570> lake<00:03:24.750> are

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
so the rocks you see around the lake are

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.630 
so the rocks you see around the lake are
actually<00:03:25.350> only<00:03:25.560> about<00:03:25.680> a<00:03:25.890> hundred<00:03:26.310> feet<00:03:26.580> high

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
actually only about a hundred feet high

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.150 
actually only about a hundred feet high
if<00:03:27.600> you<00:03:27.690> come<00:03:27.900> here<00:03:28.080> to<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.320> observation<00:03:29.130> deck

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
if you come here to the observation deck

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.310 
if you come here to the observation deck
above<00:03:29.640> the<00:03:29.790> dam<00:03:30.000> then<00:03:30.540> you'll<00:03:30.750> see<00:03:30.989> very

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
above the dam then you'll see very

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.650 
above the dam then you'll see very
simply<00:03:31.890> you<00:03:32.550> do<00:03:32.730> not<00:03:32.880> want<00:03:33.150> to<00:03:33.239> jump<00:03:33.450> up

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
simply you do not want to jump up

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.540 
simply you do not want to jump up
