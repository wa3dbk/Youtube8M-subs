for us today artists to get our first

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:27.990 
for us today artists to get our first
taste<00:00:15.920> of<00:00:16.189> some<00:00:16.369> stomach

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.000 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.510 

so<00:00:29.000> it's<00:00:29.930> very<00:00:29.990> hard<00:00:30.260> a<00:00:30.410> pre-event<00:00:30.949> anyway<00:00:31.369> the

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
so it's very hard a pre-event anyway the

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.520 
so it's very hard a pre-event anyway the
gauge<00:00:31.699> we<00:00:31.970> were<00:00:32.059> going<00:00:32.239> to<00:00:32.300> be<00:00:32.419> so<00:00:32.750> to<00:00:33.320> start

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
gauge we were going to be so to start

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.569 
gauge we were going to be so to start
what<00:00:33.739> you're<00:00:33.860> just<00:00:33.920> going<00:00:34.070> to<00:00:34.160> go<00:00:34.250> out<00:00:34.280> and<00:00:34.430> do

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
what you're just going to go out and do

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:36.369 
what you're just going to go out and do
anything<00:00:34.610> and<00:00:35.600> then<00:00:35.720> obviously<00:00:35.870> by<00:00:36.140> the<00:00:36.230> end

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:36.379 
anything and then obviously by the end

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:38.260 
anything and then obviously by the end
of<00:00:36.470> the<00:00:36.559> first<00:00:36.710> time<00:00:36.980> we've<00:00:37.340> ever<00:00:37.489> bit<00:00:37.910> of<00:00:38.000> an

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
of the first time we've ever bit of an

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.420 
of the first time we've ever bit of an
idea<00:00:38.450> where<00:00:38.780> we<00:00:38.870> stick<00:00:39.110> and<00:00:39.860> then<00:00:39.949> target<00:00:40.370> a

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
idea where we stick and then target a

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:53.150 
idea where we stick and then target a
result<00:00:40.730> from<00:00:40.820> the<00:00:41.000> answer

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.410

is good and obviously there's a lot of
learning<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.310> know<00:01:35.399> every<00:01:35.670> stage<00:01:35.880> goes<00:01:36.119> by

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
learning you know every stage goes by

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.490 
learning you know every stage goes by
we're<00:01:36.509> getting<00:01:36.689> quicker<00:01:36.899> and<00:01:37.079> Krooked<00:01:37.350> I'm

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
know it's still a long way to go though

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.889

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.360 

this<00:02:30.260> is<00:02:30.380> how<00:02:30.530> first<00:02:30.770> time<00:02:30.980> we<00:02:31.070> convened

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
this is how first time we convened

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.310 
this is how first time we convened
obviously<00:02:31.730> but<00:02:31.940> there's<00:02:32.930> been<00:02:33.020> a<00:02:33.080> huge

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
obviously but there's been a huge

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.380 
obviously but there's been a huge
learning<00:02:33.410> experience<00:02:33.740> like<00:02:34.310> yesterday<00:02:35.300> when

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
learning experience like yesterday when

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.730 
learning experience like yesterday when
we<00:02:35.510> started<00:02:35.870> at<00:02:35.990> pace<00:02:36.140> was<00:02:36.380> but<00:02:36.560> you<00:02:36.680> know

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
we started at pace was but you know

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.830 
we started at pace was but you know
probably<00:02:37.040> not<00:02:37.220> where<00:02:37.370> I<00:02:37.430> wanted<00:02:37.670> it<00:02:37.760> to<00:02:37.850> be<00:02:37.970> and

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
probably not where I wanted it to be and

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.840 
probably not where I wanted it to be and
now<00:02:38.990> you<00:02:39.470> know<00:02:39.500> we<00:02:39.740> sit<00:02:40.100> in<00:02:40.220> times<00:02:40.460> better<00:02:40.790> than

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
now you know we sit in times better than

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.390 
now you know we sit in times better than
what<00:02:41.030> I<00:02:41.060> expected<00:02:41.210> so<00:02:41.840> but<00:02:42.800> then<00:02:43.010> then<00:02:43.160> saying

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
what I expected so but then then saying

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.140 
what I expected so but then then saying
that<00:02:43.550> you<00:02:43.670> know<00:02:43.790> we've<00:02:43.910> learned<00:02:44.090> from

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
that you know we've learned from

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.280 
that you know we've learned from
previous<00:02:44.390> events<00:02:44.960> and<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:45.140> world

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
previous events and the world

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.050 
previous events and the world
championship<00:02:45.770> with<00:02:46.190> the<00:02:46.220> probably<00:02:46.640> so<00:02:46.760> driver

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
championship with the probably so driver

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.610 
championship with the probably so driver
that<00:02:47.270> you've<00:02:47.780> got<00:02:47.900> to<00:02:47.960> get<00:02:48.020> to<00:02:48.200> finish<00:02:48.380> and

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
that you've got to get to finish and

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.590 
that you've got to get to finish and
then<00:02:48.680> they<00:02:48.830> are<00:02:48.860> along<00:02:49.190> rally<00:02:49.430> so<00:02:49.790> you<00:02:50.480> know

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
then they are along rally so you know

00:02:50.600 --> 00:03:00.160 
then they are along rally so you know
these<00:02:50.750> two<00:02:50.900> days<00:02:51.410> running<00:02:51.590> tomorrow
