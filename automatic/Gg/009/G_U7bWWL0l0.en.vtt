00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.370 
would be maybe a little bit frizzy
something<00:01:41.490> just<00:01:41.759> wouldn't<00:01:42.030> be<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.299> good<00:01:42.479> I'm

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380

using an a paddle brush kind of just to

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.410 
using an a paddle brush kind of just to
smooth<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.079> out<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.619> like<00:01:47.460> this<00:01:47.700> brush<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.240> lot

it's one of my top brushes ever it's by
Aveda<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:52.250> I<00:01:53.250> think<00:01:53.700> they<00:01:53.939> stopped<00:01:54.210> doing<00:01:54.420> this

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
Aveda I I think they stopped doing this

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.149 
Aveda I I think they stopped doing this
small<00:01:54.840> version<00:01:55.200> but<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.409> believe<00:01:55.740> they<00:01:55.920> still

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
small version but I believe they still

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.940 
small version but I believe they still
do<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.490> large<00:01:57.180> paddle<00:01:57.659> brush<00:01:57.810> just<00:01:58.770> blow

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
do the large paddle brush just blow

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.520 
do the large paddle brush just blow
drying<00:01:59.250> down<00:01:59.520> it's<00:02:00.390> much<00:02:00.930> better<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.320> blow

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
drying down it's much better to blow

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.219 
drying down it's much better to blow
dried<00:02:01.770> down<00:02:02.329> just<00:02:03.329> because<00:02:03.659> it<00:02:03.840> keeps<00:02:03.960> the

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
dried down just because it keeps the

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.139 
dried down just because it keeps the
cuticle<00:02:04.710> smooth<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.549> keeps<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:05.909> going

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
cuticle smooth and it keeps it going

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.309 
cuticle smooth and it keeps it going
down<00:02:06.860> so<00:02:07.860> then<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.220> just<00:02:08.459> keep<00:02:08.940> going<00:02:09.149> then<00:02:10.050> I

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
down so then I just keep going then I

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.590 
down so then I just keep going then I
try<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.770> I<00:02:11.250> try<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.540> go<00:02:12.959> through<00:02:13.319> the

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
layers and well dry in between and using

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.520
