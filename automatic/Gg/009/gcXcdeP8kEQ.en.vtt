00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
do that is passing egg between two

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.900 
do that is passing egg between two
shells<00:02:28.780> while<00:02:29.080> leaving<00:02:29.800> the<00:02:29.950> egg<00:02:30.190> whites<00:02:32.910> next

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
shells while leaving the egg whites next

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.990 
shells while leaving the egg whites next
we're<00:02:34.030> going<00:02:34.150> to<00:02:34.210> whisk<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.930> egg<00:02:35.080> white<00:02:35.350> to

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
make 50 so this is about the consistency

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.880 
make 50 so this is about the consistency
