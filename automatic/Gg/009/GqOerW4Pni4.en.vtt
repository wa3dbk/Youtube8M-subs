00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.719 
much the reasoning behind all of these
players<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:19.110> are<00:01:19.200> about<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.470> rise<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.009> some

players that are about to rise and some

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:21.890 
players that are about to rise and some
of<00:01:20.820> them<00:01:20.909> have<00:01:20.939> already<00:01:21.210> started<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.720> rise

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
of them have already started to rise

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.749 
of them have already started to rise
heavily<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.590> I'm<00:01:22.680> about<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.070> show<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
heavily and I'm about to show you the

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
list of players that I think will rise

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.410

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
instantly because these players prices

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.100 
instantly because these players prices
will<00:01:35.670> be<00:01:35.700> even<00:01:36.060> more<00:01:36.299> than<00:01:36.659> they<00:01:36.780> are<00:01:36.900> there

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
will be even more than they are there

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.130 
will be even more than they are there
now<00:01:37.229> so<00:01:38.119> 6.8<00:01:39.119> k<00:01:39.299> for<00:01:39.479> clock<00:01:39.659> at<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.900> moment

now so 6.8 k for clock at the moment

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.480 
now so 6.8 k for clock at the moment
literally<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.890> cheapest<00:01:41.250> on<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.400> market

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
that is very very expensive for an Irish

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.770 
that is very very expensive for an Irish
player<00:01:44.340> there's<00:01:44.880> no<00:01:45.030> other<00:01:45.180> reason<00:01:45.540> for<00:01:45.659> him

not honest because this is going to be

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.889 
not honest because this is going to be

I mean look about twenty thousand coins
at<00:02:31.769> the<00:02:31.829> moment<00:02:32.129> he<00:02:32.519> is<00:02:32.700> going<00:02:32.849> to<00:02:32.969> be<00:02:33.030> gone<00:02:33.120> for

at the moment he is going to be gone for
an<00:02:33.359> absolute<00:02:33.599> bomb<00:02:34.049> when<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.310> when<00:02:35.519> the<00:02:35.549> cat

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
an absolute bomb when the when the cat

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:37.459 
an absolute bomb when the when the cat
when<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.299> when<00:02:36.629> the<00:02:36.659> cop<00:02:36.870> comes<00:02:37.049> out<00:02:37.170> thing<00:02:37.349> is

when the when the cop comes out thing is
like<00:02:37.590> I<00:02:37.859> think<00:02:37.920> you'll<00:02:38.189> be<00:02:38.280> like<00:02:38.370> 35<00:02:38.819> okay

like I think you'll be like 35 okay
quite<00:02:39.540> easily<00:02:39.719> obviously<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.709> players<00:02:40.919> will

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
quite easily obviously the players will

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.190 
quite easily obviously the players will
drop<00:02:41.340> afterwards<00:02:41.790> so<00:02:41.969> if<00:02:42.209> you<00:02:42.359> are<00:02:42.510> invested

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
drop afterwards so if you are invested

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.599 
drop afterwards so if you are invested
in<00:02:43.319> some<00:02:43.469> of<00:02:43.560> these<00:02:43.620> players<00:02:43.889> make<00:02:44.219> sure<00:02:44.430> you

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:44.609 
in some of these players make sure you

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:47.119 
in some of these players make sure you
sell<00:02:44.819> them<00:02:44.969> ASAP<00:02:45.510> after<00:02:46.469> the<00:02:46.590> coop<00:02:46.769> is<00:02:46.889> done

sell them ASAP after the coop is done

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:48.500 
sell them ASAP after the coop is done
because<00:02:47.340> these<00:02:47.639> players<00:02:48.030> will<00:02:48.180> be<00:02:48.329> worth

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510

recently<00:04:43.260> going<00:04:43.500> up<00:04:43.620> because<00:04:43.800> I<00:04:44.280> think<00:04:44.520> he

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
recently going up because I think he

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:46.700 
recently going up because I think he
just<00:04:44.970> got<00:04:45.030> transferred<00:04:45.360> to<00:04:45.570> Everton<00:04:46.020> and<00:04:46.199> this

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
just got transferred to Everton and this

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.129 
just got transferred to Everton and this
card<00:04:47.010> will<00:04:47.190> no<00:04:47.370> longer<00:04:47.400> be<00:04:48.060> in<00:04:48.180> packs<00:04:48.449> so<00:04:48.750> I'm

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
card will no longer be in packs so I'm

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:50.540 
card will no longer be in packs so I'm
assuming<00:04:49.290> that's<00:04:49.650> the<00:04:49.830> reason<00:04:50.100> this<00:04:50.190> card<00:04:50.430> is

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
assuming that's the reason this card is

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:51.980 
assuming that's the reason this card is
going<00:04:50.669> up<00:04:50.850> and<00:04:51.060> of<00:04:51.180> course<00:04:51.210> because<00:04:51.750> of<00:04:51.780> the

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
going up and of course because of the

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.439 
going up and of course because of the
cup<00:04:52.169> so<00:04:52.470> I<00:04:52.650> think<00:04:53.220> his<00:04:53.520> Everton<00:04:53.850> card<00:04:54.240> will<00:04:54.419> be

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
cup so I think his Everton card will be

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:57.290 
cup so I think his Everton card will be
going<00:04:54.690> for<00:04:54.810> like<00:04:54.930> 15<00:04:55.620> K<00:04:55.949> 20<00:04:56.010> K<00:04:56.310> maybe<00:04:56.699> even<00:04:57.060> a

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
going for like 15 K 20 K maybe even a

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.370 
going for like 15 K 20 K maybe even a
little<00:04:57.330> bit<00:04:57.540> less<00:04:57.810> I'm<00:04:57.990> not<00:04:58.080> too<00:04:58.199> sure<00:04:58.350> about

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
little bit less I'm not too sure about

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.640
