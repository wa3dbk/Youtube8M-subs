 grove that makes europe today 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.820
 I will talk about this, we are a 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.580
 digital inference with this I love you 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.120

 purchase or production we can print 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.170
 you even because not until your 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.479
 cookbooks 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.000
 today it is incredible that still 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.520
 find doubts about the advantages that 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.009
 a digital press can give you so 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.409
 that today I will mention three points 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:30.229
 important among the many that you can 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:33.799
 find when printing with us and the 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:36.320
 first point it comes to printing in 24 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:39.350
 hours with this that is what I want 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.149
 tell you print in 24 hours means 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.460
 that at the moment in which we 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:46.159
 we received your authorized file 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:49.490
 completely from that moment you will be able 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.740
 start counting 24 hours or a day that 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.409
 it's the same so that to have your 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:58.340
 printed on your hands that is not amazing 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:00.289
 or tell me what you knew but good the day of 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.940
 today you already know and you are about to 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:05.060
 enter a new stage of growth 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.399
 for you or your company but this 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.549
 we will mention in our next video 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:13.430
 blog today let's go back to the second point in what 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:16.370
 that we were also talking about what 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.489
 is the low volume what I mean with 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.990
 handle low volume when you think 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.210
 in print tell me 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.880
 many times the first thing that you get 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:29.180
 comes to mind is a thousand two 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.820
 thousands high costs for example but 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.070
 Now it is not like that because we like 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.210
 I told you we can print you 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:40.940
 up to 50 copies and this is 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:44.750
 wonderful and good the last point not 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.640
 least the low inexpensive 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.300
 cost means as your name what 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.970
 Tell us how we handle it because 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:56.510
 for agriculture that faces low volumes 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.880
 is not synonymous with high costs but everything 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.090
 otherwise as our specialty 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:05.630
 it's just that driving low 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:09.290
 volumes at low costs and up to 24 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:12.440
 good hours well so you already know 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:16.100
 Now if what you need is to print 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.450
 but print at low volume low cost 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.180
 and up to 24 hours 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.440
