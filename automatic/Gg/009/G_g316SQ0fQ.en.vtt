00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.340
 feather 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:31.190
 To check the game a bit 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:35.810
 Gameplay tachou geek 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:37.950
 I found the game very light for directx 11 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.550
 so much so that I got it right 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.770
 in the maximum configurations 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.829
 and a very high resolution that had already 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.740
 check what's going on here right? 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.380
 they can observe and 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:54.270
 a car in between the details that 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.270
 It could turn out nice. 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.180
 let's check it out 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:17.520
 the resolution here at en3 falls in 2011 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.520
 with 1,626 for new york 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:25.640
 can be successful in the womb is in another 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:28.960
 this court what we are going to execute 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:34.240
 what I think performance because 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:36.970
 Come with us and see how it is. 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.130
 will be behaving the game does not work 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:45.180
 program information I use 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:48.640
 then I started the demon and the 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.650
 pacaembu 64 nÃ© 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:56.080
 We can check the gt1 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:59.080
 the 2 is the climbing game coming to damn 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.080
 81 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.530
 a part 2 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.299
 head 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:16.750
 the lawyer 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:19.810
 society degrees there and he is 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.180
 Maintaining a good rate of 7 keeps up 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.320
 of 60 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.320
 of course they did 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:35.680
 shadowplay 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.680
 the pure plate / shop as 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.790
 taking whenever he liked 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.790
 to post a video cap 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.129
 it's not that game 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:59.150
 died this morning the only care without 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.150
 touches can be punished 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.070
 the scoreboard counting that fell 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.060
 is scheduled 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.040
 word of mouth 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.450
 the first will get more because she 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.450
 whenever the most sacrificed 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.040
 the flame that observation 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:35.590
 make success of the other 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:40.599
 and I know it made the other three covers 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.599
 fx water reaches more than 10 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.370
 It was for all 333 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.489
 The Coach 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:56.820
 because in this definition you do not even need 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:04:02.130
 of theft 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:02.130
 then left the china to 4 x 6 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:09.330
 and it's already super 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:13.250
 already power the borrowed resolution book 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:15.830
 Average bell with 63 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.190
 remembering that the maximum set of taco 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.190
 settings 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:28.330
 and there it is at 3 k I sat the fx the court 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.330
 kick right 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:34.850
 and for those who have an NVIDIA it may be 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:38.090
 in this posture will see that it picks up if a 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:40.580
 even a little average guide 63 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:44.620
 I always play that average is a little 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.620
 above this because Miguel 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.850
 the game was also the first since 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:55.000
 fell a little certain that will give the 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:58.000
 that here the video does not get too long 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 right 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:05.730
 Bahia new game land is not to leave 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:08.880
 one more lap in the graphics car too 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:11.270
 well then a drop is really very 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:14.870
 beautiful 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:17.560
 I'm going to buy this original game as 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.560
 they had been buying 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.990
 It's a worthwhile game I thought 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:28.690
 could x11 so a sense or travel in the 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.950
 sense to use the effects without 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.730
 makeup 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:36.400
 without weighing the machine I thought it was 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:39.000
 very well optimized this game even one 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.000
 syndrome 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.770
 I still thought I did well 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:46.960
 So that's it folks are staying for 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.960
 Here I am going to make more video. 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:56.490

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:59.430

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:02.770
