00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.190 

it's<00:03:36.890> not<00:03:37.130> super<00:03:37.400> like<00:03:37.700> steep<00:03:38.390> or<00:03:38.900> anything

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
it's not super like steep or anything

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.770 
it's not super like steep or anything
but<00:03:39.560> it's<00:03:39.740> um<00:03:39.980> just<00:03:40.280> the<00:03:40.730> rock<00:03:40.940> so<00:03:41.330> jagged<00:03:41.720> and

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
but it's um just the rock so jagged and

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.660 
but it's um just the rock so jagged and
the<00:03:41.870> waters<00:03:42.140> so<00:03:42.170> cold<00:03:42.560> that<00:03:42.740> you're<00:03:43.370> just<00:03:43.520> so

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
the waters so cold that you're just so

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.040 
the waters so cold that you're just so
scared<00:03:43.940> of<00:03:44.000> going<00:03:44.150> upside<00:03:44.540> down<00:03:44.750> and<00:03:44.960> just

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
scared of going upside down and just

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.410 
scared of going upside down and just
smashing<00:03:45.620> the<00:03:45.710> face<00:03:45.980> off<00:03:46.250> like<00:03:46.550> that's

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
smashing the face off like that's

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:48.640 
smashing the face off like that's
probably<00:03:47.720> the<00:03:47.810> most<00:03:47.990> nerve-wracking<00:03:48.620> part

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
probably the most nerve-wracking part

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.410 
probably the most nerve-wracking part
and<00:03:48.980> also<00:03:49.220> with<00:03:49.490> the<00:03:49.610> rocks<00:03:49.820> your<00:03:50.030> boat<00:03:50.060> can

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
and also with the rocks your boat can

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.450 
and also with the rocks your boat can
get<00:03:50.540> full<00:03:50.750> sideways<00:03:51.320> underwater<00:03:52.070> and<00:03:52.280> stuff

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:52.460 
get full sideways underwater and stuff

00:03:52.460 --> 00:04:01.460 
get full sideways underwater and stuff
that's<00:03:53.180> kind<00:03:53.360> of<00:03:53.480> pretty<00:03:53.810> bad<00:03:54.140> there

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.380 

here<00:04:02.130> we've<00:04:02.280> got<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:02.490> core<00:04:02.730> section<00:04:03.210> of<00:04:03.300> the

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
here we've got the core section of the

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
river it's probably we're just going to

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.920 
river it's probably we're just going to
paper<00:04:05.070> break<00:04:05.460> you<00:04:05.640> get<00:04:06.270> a<00:04:06.330> couple<00:04:06.630> of<00:04:06.720> rocks

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930

you might be getting mouth to mouth

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.310 
you might be getting mouth to mouth
before<00:04:50.080> you<00:04:50.290> know<00:04:50.500> it<00:04:51.690> so<00:04:52.690> what's<00:04:52.930> this<00:04:53.050> first

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
before you know it so what's this first

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.900 
before you know it so what's this first
this<00:04:53.500> is<00:04:53.590> the<00:04:53.650> first<00:04:53.890> section<00:04:54.100> right<00:04:54.460> yes<00:04:54.700> we

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
this is the first section right yes we

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.660 
this is the first section right yes we
have<00:04:55.120> first<00:04:55.870> core<00:04:56.200> section<00:04:56.650> so<00:04:57.220> basically

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:57.670 
have first core section so basically

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.840 
have first core section so basically
this<00:04:58.510> moves<00:04:58.870> between<00:04:59.080> two<00:04:59.440> rocks<00:04:59.650> to<00:05:00.370> start

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
this moves between two rocks to start

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.110 
this moves between two rocks to start
setting<00:05:01.120> up<00:05:01.330> you're<00:05:01.540> starting<00:05:01.900> about<00:05:01.990> I<00:05:02.470> know

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
setting up you're starting about I know

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.660 
setting up you're starting about I know
maybe<00:05:04.120> 70<00:05:04.870> or<00:05:05.020> 80<00:05:05.200> feet<00:05:05.530> up<00:05:05.800> throughout<00:05:06.310> the

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:06.670 
maybe 70 or 80 feet up throughout the

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.640 
maybe 70 or 80 feet up throughout the
river<00:05:06.880> and<00:05:07.240> it's<00:05:07.600> just<00:05:07.840> all<00:05:08.050> sitting<00:05:08.410> you're

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
river and it's just all sitting you're

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.490 
river and it's just all sitting you're
up<00:05:08.740> to<00:05:08.920> made<00:05:09.100> it<00:05:09.250> through<00:05:09.430> these<00:05:09.640> rocks<00:05:09.940> it's<00:05:10.240> a

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
up to made it through these rocks it's a
