packaging okay so here's a box first

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.959

sight<00:00:30.960> it's<00:00:31.140> really<00:00:31.439> adorable<00:00:31.740> I<00:00:32.130> love<00:00:32.669> the

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
sight it's really adorable I love the

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.880 
sight it's really adorable I love the
red<00:00:33.120> border<00:00:33.420> on<00:00:33.630> this<00:00:33.809> one<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.230> think<00:00:34.469> this<00:00:34.739> is

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
red border on this one I think this is

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.170 
red border on this one I think this is
probably<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.250> only<00:00:35.399> corner<00:00:35.820> art<00:00:36.000> that

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
probably the only corner art that

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.880 
probably the only corner art that
actually<00:00:36.210> works<00:00:36.840> maybe<00:00:37.260> because<00:00:37.530> his<00:00:37.680> mouth

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
actually works maybe because his mouth

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.740 
actually works maybe because his mouth
isn't<00:00:38.129> showing<00:00:38.430> or<00:00:38.610> anything<00:00:38.790> like<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.059> so

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
isn't showing or anything like that so

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.000 
isn't showing or anything like that so
it<00:00:39.870> looks<00:00:39.989> weird<00:00:40.200> with<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.410> little<00:00:40.770> shine<00:00:40.980> on

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
it looks weird with that little shine on

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.040 
it looks weird with that little shine on
it<00:00:41.309> but<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:41.790> shows<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.000> set<00:00:42.300> really<00:00:42.660> well<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:42.960> it

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
it but it shows a set really well and it

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.930

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
been seeing since 2012 you guys heard my

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.530 
been seeing since 2012 you guys heard my
room<00:01:47.159> about<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.610> but<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.149> one's<00:01:48.390> special

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
room about it but this one's special

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.030 
room about it but this one's special
because<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:49.020> has<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.320> little<00:01:49.380> hinge<00:01:49.829> right

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.899 
here in red for legs which I think
actually<00:01:52.770> makes<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.340> look<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.579> little<00:01:53.700> bit

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
kind of a weird piece but the really

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.740 
kind of a weird piece but the really
cool<00:02:48.370> part<00:02:48.579> is<00:02:48.849> that<00:02:48.969> it<00:02:49.090> has<00:02:49.209> printed<00:02:49.540> pieces

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
cool part is that it has printed pieces

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.569 
cool part is that it has printed pieces
on<00:02:50.019> the<00:02:50.200> front<00:02:50.439> on<00:02:50.590> these<00:02:50.829> little<00:02:51.040> parts<00:02:51.400> for

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
on the front on these little parts for

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.250 
on the front on these little parts for
the<00:02:51.639> headlights<00:02:52.030> then<00:02:52.629> they<00:02:52.780> have<00:02:52.930> it<00:02:53.079> for

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
the headlights then they have it for

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.349 
the headlights then they have it for
this<00:02:53.379> little<00:02:53.560> panel<00:02:54.010> on<00:02:54.189> the<00:02:54.280> front<00:02:54.430> which<00:02:55.150> I

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:55.359 
this little panel on the front which I

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:56.610 
this little panel on the front which I
guess<00:02:55.510> that<00:02:55.659> panel<00:02:55.930> can<00:02:56.049> be<00:02:56.079> used<00:02:56.379> for<00:02:56.469> other

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
guess that panel can be used for other

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.009 
guess that panel can be used for other
stuff<00:02:56.980> or<00:02:57.280> maybe<00:02:57.519> spider-man<00:02:58.030> box<00:02:58.269> but<00:02:58.989> I

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
stuff or maybe spider-man box but I

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.689 
stuff or maybe spider-man box but I
don't<00:02:59.319> think<00:02:59.590> the<00:02:59.680> headlights<00:03:00.099> can<00:03:00.310> be<00:03:00.489> used

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:00.699 
don't think the headlights can be used

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:02.099 
don't think the headlights can be used
but<00:03:00.909> still<00:03:01.180> it's<00:03:01.419> nice<00:03:01.569> to<00:03:01.719> get<00:03:01.810> printed

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
but still it's nice to get printed

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:03.659

and you got this little web and that's

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.100 
and you got this little web and that's
it<00:04:44.970> so<00:04:45.180> you<00:04:45.240> got<00:04:45.389> this<00:04:45.450> little<00:04:45.690> pull<00:04:45.870> on<00:04:45.900> the

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
it so you got this little pull on the

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.620 
it so you got this little pull on the
top<00:04:46.290> and<00:04:46.770> there's<00:04:47.130> no<00:04:47.430> detail

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630

right here but I mean I guess that kind

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.080 
right here but I mean I guess that kind
of<00:04:55.320> a<00:04:55.410> detail<00:04:55.830> is<00:04:56.310> what<00:04:56.550> they<00:04:56.639> show<00:04:56.820> is<00:04:56.970> they

and now spider-man's car like I said
it's<00:05:33.720> really<00:05:33.840> cool<00:05:34.350> because<00:05:34.530> it<00:05:34.770> has<00:05:34.800> some

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
it's really cool because it has some

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.680 
it's really cool because it has some
printed<00:05:35.550> pieces<00:05:35.850> that<00:05:35.970> are<00:05:36.060> exclusive<00:05:36.510> to<00:05:36.600> the

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
printed pieces that are exclusive to the

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.840 
printed pieces that are exclusive to the
set<00:05:36.930> I<00:05:37.169> probably<00:05:37.800> can't<00:05:38.100> find<00:05:38.340> a<00:05:38.430> use<00:05:38.610> for

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:38.850 
set I probably can't find a use for

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.360 
set I probably can't find a use for
these<00:05:39.030> parts<00:05:39.690> right<00:05:39.810> here<00:05:39.990> but<00:05:40.950> this<00:05:41.130> part

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
these parts right here but this part

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:42.469 
these parts right here but this part
right<00:05:41.490> here<00:05:41.640> you<00:05:41.700> could<00:05:41.880> probably<00:05:42.000> find<00:05:42.270> a<00:05:42.330> use

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 
right here you could probably find a use

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:44.000 
right here you could probably find a use
for<00:05:42.660> because<00:05:42.870> it<00:05:42.990> shows<00:05:43.110> kind<00:05:43.620> of<00:05:43.650> a<00:05:43.740> spider

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 
for because it shows kind of a spider

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.250 
for because it shows kind of a spider
symbol<00:05:44.460> so<00:05:44.850> that's<00:05:44.970> pretty<00:05:45.120> cool<00:05:45.330> and<00:05:45.660> just

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260 
symbol so that's pretty cool and just

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.659 
symbol so that's pretty cool and just
the<00:05:46.350> parts<00:05:46.710> in<00:05:46.800> this<00:05:46.950> set<00:05:47.130> like<00:05:47.310> I<00:05:47.370> like<00:05:47.550> the

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:47.669 
the parts in this set like I like the

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:49.730 
the parts in this set like I like the
little<00:05:47.820> frame<00:05:48.210> for<00:05:48.510> the<00:05:48.570> car<00:05:48.810> which<00:05:49.440> is

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
little frame for the car which is

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.560 
little frame for the car which is
exclusive<00:05:50.220> really<00:05:50.460> to<00:05:50.580> the<00:05:50.669> jr.<00:05:51.000> sets<00:05:51.300> and

exclusive really to the jr. sets and

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.840 
exclusive really to the jr. sets and
those<00:05:52.080> printed<00:05:52.470> pieces<00:05:52.710> now<00:05:53.580> the<00:05:53.669> big

those printed pieces now the big

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.240

disappointment<00:05:54.419> is<00:05:54.570> the<00:05:54.780> minifigures<00:05:55.289> both

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
disappointment is the minifigures both

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:57.620 
disappointment is the minifigures both
of<00:05:56.370> the<00:05:56.430> minifigures<00:05:56.880> aren't<00:05:57.120> exclusive<00:05:57.419> or

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
of the minifigures aren't exclusive or

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:58.219 
of the minifigures aren't exclusive or
anything<00:05:57.810> like<00:05:57.990> that

00:05:58.219 --> 00:05:58.229 
anything like that

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:01.070 
anything like that
unlike<00:05:58.830> the<00:05:59.520> the<00:05:59.550> Batman<00:06:00.300> set<00:06:00.570> where<00:06:00.780> we<00:06:00.900> had

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 
unlike the the Batman set where we had

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.620 
unlike the the Batman set where we had
kind<00:06:01.800> of<00:06:01.889> like<00:06:02.039> two<00:06:02.430> exclusive<00:06:03.060> variations

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.630 
kind of like two exclusive variations

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.279 
kind of like two exclusive variations
which<00:06:04.260> was<00:06:04.440> just<00:06:04.770> great<00:06:05.010> I<00:06:05.100> really<00:06:05.130> loved<00:06:05.580> that

which was just great I really loved that

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:08.300 
which was just great I really loved that
but<00:06:07.289> in<00:06:07.410> this<00:06:07.530> one<00:06:07.740> the<00:06:07.889> only<00:06:07.919> really

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
but in this one the only really

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.070 
but in this one the only really
exclusive<00:06:08.789> part<00:06:09.210> I<00:06:09.240> guess<00:06:09.360> you<00:06:09.450> can<00:06:09.570> say<00:06:09.780> is

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
exclusive part I guess you can say is

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.290 
exclusive part I guess you can say is
the<00:06:10.650> hinge<00:06:10.950> on<00:06:11.220> spider-man's<00:06:11.789> outfit<00:06:12.150> which

does look better on him than the regular
outfit<00:06:14.250> which<00:06:14.400> is<00:06:14.520> kind<00:06:14.700> of<00:06:14.729> weird<00:06:14.880> but<00:06:15.780> that's

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900
