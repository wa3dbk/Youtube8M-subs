00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.370
 and greet the cyclos friends more 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.469
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.719
 new video damage for a squat 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.580
 Special builder team of France 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.869
 guys so there really is very very 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.890
 heavy for me this is one of 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.750
 best teams in France that we can 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.949
 to be on this fifa 12 ultimate team 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.689
 for the moment there are not yet the 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.170
 boost cards of many players 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.849
 French 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.740
 there are no dot cards yet and that's 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.849
 so I decided to take the training 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.619
 4 3 3 4 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.390
 so it's gone in your suite 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.989
 start with the guardian no more 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.940
 expect 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.530
 this is the coc lloris here we would have 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.360
 could put ruffier guys but like 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.920
 I have the budget I wanted to test rift 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.870
 I wanted to test legal lloris and 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.120
 honestly I was not disappointed he's 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.530
 very very good with 165 speed for 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.450
 the outputs is really the ideal or 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.059
 listen to 36,000 credit has certainly it's 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.050
 a little bit a little budget guys so 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.610
 you do not have the credits take 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.469
 ruffier he will do it that's for sure he 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.789
 worth a lot cheaper we go to the 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.399
 hinge guys hinge there is no 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.949
 no complications it is varane with 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.539
 sir laurent koscielny here on 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.670
 fifa has completely cheated this 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.049
 hinge the koscielny 81 guys from 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.880
 speed guys this is a brothel 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.680
 frankly it's a mess so it's worth 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.510
 around 10 between ten and fifteen 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.250
 thousand credit them in a package then 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.930
 paranoid there is excellent him increased 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.130
 of 6.1 speed stage it is very 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.810
 great very physical it is really 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.250
 imposing and here I am really kiffe 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.840
 this hinge is really very very 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.860
 interesting to us this case after 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.330
 if you do not have the credits or done 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.850
 a sakho kaboul it will also send 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.740
 then right defender guys we 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.490
 have mathieu debuchy beautiful map this 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.290
 year on foot 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.210
 promoted the new tensioner 3000 credit 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.400
 maybe and he's very complete there to 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.810
 15.76 speed but honestly it's 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.329
 not feel he's very very good with his 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.950
 note of 70 cities of physics and 78 of 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.409
 defense he is very complete and 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.340
 frankly it makes the heap largely 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.380
 left defender guys we have 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.060
 patrice evra I could have put clichy 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.049
 to have a little more speed but 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.490
 I prefer the arms because he is 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.290
 really strong he is really very 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.659
 very complete it is beautiful revival 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.670
 and then here it is costing I believe 5000 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.630
 credit I'm not 100% sure but I 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.250
 believe they taste in the indes 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.780
 around 5000 credit so that's it's 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.520
 not very expensive clichy costs a little more 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.439
 expensive but here after if you have them 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.119
 budgets he did as you feel 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.950
 in any case it's the team that I 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.140
 prefer the 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.950
 the team of France preferred it is finally 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.930
 found the right term 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.879
 then we move on to both backgrounds 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.739
 central so we have blaise matuidi 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:17.209
 that I simply find 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.160
 exceptional and we have yu-hwan 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.209
 cabaye blaise matuidi damage he is 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.069
 monstrous 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.050
 seventy-eight speed but he is 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.180
 he's so fast guys it's 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.519
 a brothel frankly with 182 of the 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.680
 physical and 84 defense he is too 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.060
 too hard guys and frankly I 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.620
 advise you for a Libyan team 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.930
 a French you want but 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.090
 buy it then us in pop cabaye 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.549
 sorry if you know me I already did a 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.140
 small fail to have for after cabaye 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.340
 very very good raiser he is very good 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.540
 in the distribution of the game there is no 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.430
 of problem on it it is not very 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.230
 very strong 1 815 but frankly he 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.920
 did make it and then goes to duel 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.079
 that's what is asked of him 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.360
 frankly it's pretty fast despite 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:54.680
 168 speed he's doing well he's getting 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.480
 door well towards the bank has no 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.010
 problem with this we move on and moss 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.329
 and the guys there I already wanted to introduced 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.880
 during a review it is about gentleman 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:03.410
 paul can not the monster guys the 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.190
 monster keep his balance sheet frozen yet 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.500
 increase 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.519
 35 matches 39 goals 19 assists 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.410
 for a snack 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.660
 it's a mess I will not tell you 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.010
 more if you do not want to have 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.780
 more information and see the review 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.760
 on him it's on the channel whose 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.410
 recent videos guys no problem 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.790
 for that we move to the right striker 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.130
 legal so the gemmi biabiany 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.049
 I would have liked to put baillar not ben 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.970
 arfa valbuena but bruce his card go 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.590
 work but maybe he will be boosted 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.930
 in mdse would be more interesting but I 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.269
 do not think so here's biabiany game the 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.440
 two a step that I do not really force 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.260
 on that player I'm just going to 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.590
 pascoal killed in a package then runs 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.090
 quick 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.650
 honestly i do not want to hide it ego 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.910
 quickly he makes the taf for the against 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.950
 attacks it's going really fast 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.510
 really killer in front of the cages after 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.450
 his right foot he is very very good must 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.250
 not be the 15,60 feel it but it is 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.620
 very very good must not have to have 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.790
 doubt on it left attacker the 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.109
 guys I could have Franck Ribery 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.150
 but here he is playing more in team of 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:57.319
 France although I would have liked them 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.060
 continue in France team but we 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.280
 have our little Antoine Griezmann 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.739
 So here's the same 4800 credit is 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.389
 really cheap for a kind of ones 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.660
 of this caliber there excuse me for the 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:08.830
 broken skype it's really cheap for 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.420
 good player like him and his only 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.070
 disadvantage to this idea left and who 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.750
 play on the left so we can dive 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.670
 gold is planted with the right foot 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.709
 it's a shame but frankly it 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.360
 is very very good and the guys to finish 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.150
 we go to the scorer it's about 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.260
 karim benzema so guys for those 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.700
 who are asking us for old art 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.530
 normally we will go out in the week 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.390
 I do not know which day but in any case 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.260
 the review will be released in the week so 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.670
 that's why I'm not going to 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.650
 show his record with otherwise it goes a 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.000
 little messed up the trick if you want to see the 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.500
 balance will you go watch my videos 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.970
 who will arrive and it will happen to you 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.760
 do not worry what I can tell you 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.080
 it's huge it's huge 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.350
 I tell you no more watching the 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:47.470
 stats 84 shots 84 shots 75 's 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.810
 pass 82 to dribble to 74.2 physics 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.010
 but very very very good guys so 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.330
 really to a very nice team of 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.880
 France it is certainly my team of 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.290
 France preferred on this fifa 12 ultimate 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.300
 team I invite you to test it if you 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.920
 have the credits otherwise bah too bad 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.910
 excuse me do not worry there is 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.170
 full of squats builder who will arrive
