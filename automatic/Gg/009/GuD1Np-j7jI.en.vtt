00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:13.110
 the other this party was the one from holland 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.790
 against chile how was the match was a 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.119
 against has end van persie on the court 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.430
 and holland and chile doing some 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.290
 small modifications the stopped 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.060
 It is always the same if you take your 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.279
 talented talented men who are 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.689
 vidal and valdivia both were not 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.489
 required of the game put 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.899
 Gutierrez is a player who sometimes 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:33.239
 plays as a playmaker but helps 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:35.070
 also in the recovery then it was 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.630
 a little cautious the pose of sampaoli 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.840
 trying to win because what they wanted 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.860
 the two teams was avoiding Brazil 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.930
 unfortunately if chile had a lot 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.740
 inconvenience in being able to assemble circuits 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.420
 of game to arrive accurately is what 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.280
 they did not exactly connect with 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.350
 bars and with alexis sanchez that always 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.970
 they put pundonor but it delivers much 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.610
 they were a little isolated as 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.870
 intern there was no definition there were few 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.650
 risk plays did not really happen 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.650
 big its development 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.630
 I think there is no rest to say 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.750
 the dutch team in this in this 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.700
 party is what I observed he puts the 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.640
 line of three flyers in the tweet that what 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.690
 put on the left the number 15 and as 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.570
 he is a man of great display 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.760
 physical although today he is 34 but not 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.020
 for him it ended up being a line of 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.760
 five that was behind the blind 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:31.040
 so I did a 53 22 12 and I was 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.290
 quiet van gaal or did what he predicted 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.540
 at the start of tournament that said he 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.300
 I could leave the show aside 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.640
 portal to succeed and today I had nothing 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.350
 energy was not the obligation to win and 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.200
 he was contemplating chile was trying 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.360
 arrive as it is and HernÃ¡n in the end could not 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.800
 spinning plays possibly for that great 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.430
 number of people who had put the 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.430
 band 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.800
 He talked that talking to the teacher 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:58.520
 vucetich also of the variables that 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:01.820
 he had chile inside the same game and what 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.740
 It was what was changing to test 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.630
 try to generate 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.209
 understanding that good was already the other 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.039
 side and that the most important party does not 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.220
 was this maybe but the one that comes 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.880
 I think I try to win it could not I think 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.319
 which he faced a good team standing 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.720
 also with very movements 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:23.900
 interesting started with a scheme of a 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.519
 3-5-2 pecile in that case driving the 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.650
 control of the middle field pressing 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.690
 always short and handling the ball very 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.430
 close to them holland for their 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.500
 part worked on unfolding 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.930
 long precisely with lens and with 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.130
 rubens where they know they have the 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.860
 speed and they know they have the 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.049
 ability to be able to hurt not what 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.850
 they succeeded or more however in 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:46.800
 number of plays in the first part 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.810
 you realize one perfectly well 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.000
 come with greater danger the team of 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.890
 holland that the chile team that has 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.860
 a little bit more wrong in the second part 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.700
 I think there are modifications where 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.370
 they 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:03.300
 chile begins to modify a 3-4-3 with 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:07.950
 the entry of the number 15 that was here 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:10.140
 in Mexico and July and that's where 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.510
 modify the scheme a bit trying to 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.220
 attacking more on the sides does not succeed 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.120
 neither and that's where the 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:21.990
 spare parts by holland and from there 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.150
 comes the turn of the sport where the 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.710
 income gave more strength and 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.210
 they gave much more strength not only there 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.580
 it was also that it was the change 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:32.490
 ended up getting one of the goals and 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.130
 put it always with that feature 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:39.980
 no pressure half court 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.980
 fast start and stop ball
