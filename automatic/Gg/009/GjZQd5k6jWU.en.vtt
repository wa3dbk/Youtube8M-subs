00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.129
 good to all we are already here we are going to 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.199
 talk in this video how to remove the 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:18.150
 oxide to two frets of our guitar 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.119
 We are going to use some products very 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.980
 specific and you will see how they give very 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.309
 good results so very attentive that 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.779
 we started in the first place let's remove 

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:31.020
 all the strings leave our maximum 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.750
 prepared and then we're going to 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.899
 paint on the guitar you must face 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.239
 the mast to cover the wood leave the 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.620
 frets to air to be able to apply the 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.620
 product or file 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.050
 Y 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:08.100
 good after sitting around the mast 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:09.270
 of hard work we are going to use a 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.360
 cleaner and metals look you can 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.600
 recommend is from the company market no 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.030
 I tell you what we're good for Spain 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.700
 we have this company and explain from 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.220
 metals in cream says that it is for 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.020
 copper bronze brass and chrome and I understand 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.330
 that there will be many products similar to 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.010
 this is the idea of ​​looking for a cleaner 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.380
 of metals to clean our oxide 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.750
 trusted because I see it pretty enough 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.700
 effective how are we going to apply this then 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.280
 we will use as who we believe 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.660
 we will use a napkin a paper 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.910
 we will apply and I also have here a 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.160
 toothbrush for if it does 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.310
 you need to give it a little stronger so 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.710
 let's go to the work 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.159
 let's apply a small amount yo 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.930
 I tell you the cleaner I imagine it is 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.720
 quite strong it has a smell 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.560
 ammonia so you have to have certain 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.229
 precautions 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.090
 with this type of chemical products and 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.159
 I say they are pretty strong in this 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.880
 case I am going to apply it as 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:11.250
 pretty careful in the area and in the 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.700
 frets that are what interests us 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.650
 clean 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.170
 he read some things about products have 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.459
 commented to those who have motorcycles that 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.980
 they say it's very good even for 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.420
 clean the air to the chromed pin of the 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.290
 escapes be so I know that this 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.000
 product is very interesting so 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.360
 nothing we are going to rub I'm going to try it another 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.690
 with him to brush a little more 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.690
 intention 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:48.830
 and let's use it better it seems the 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.830
 napkin that is cleaner 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:01.800
 you can not see the piece appear dirt 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:04.050
 it starts to look like the crap that 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.940
 They have the frets and we do not see 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.940
 to run a little more product 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.959
 Y 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:20.510
 we also go to the napkin because this 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.890
 pretty cream product 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.430
 above all they applied the voice to apply 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.430
 is 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.300
 clear saints 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:37.290
 Now you can see it amazing 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:43.379
 amount of dirt that can accumulate 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:47.280
 in this case it is not the metal of a 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:49.580
 last passage and to retouch for 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.580
 clean 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.270
 as you can see there are effects left but 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.270
 yes i can appreciate it 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:03.769
 It is quite enough I will continue 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.769
 how to continue 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.200
 to give some product 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.530
 or not 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.280
 clear the toothbrush before what 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.519
 had had used it to apply 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.740
 spread a bit of antioxidants 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:27.160
 then that fat no no I did not know 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:29.100
 to clean with him that's why he cleans a 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.880
 little the leg but good 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.880
 we follow 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.139
 we keep going 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.300
 Y 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.360
 A) Yes 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.680
 i 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.790
 two 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:11.970
 the idea is to apply the product 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:15.300
 rub a little with a clean napkin 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:19.830
 a clean surface and be able to remove the 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:25.520
 embedded fat and the oxide that is 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:25.520
 also the strong point to clean 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.900
 Y 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.080
 two 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:56.249
 good and after giving it good fruit 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:58.800
 with a cloth or napkin according to 

00:05:56.249 --> 00:06:00.449
 comment on the product and rub as it remains 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.920
 more or less this result to see if 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:06.700
 can teach 

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:09.880
 of how you see was beautiful in effects 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:11.290
 full also a good chrome and look 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.750
 leave last behind that if they send me to 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:16.180
 see if you can see the difference 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:17.620
 here you have the last one of well reflects the 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.350
 light because we are giving it full 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:23.050
 but if you fix it and drink the colon 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:25.060
 of oxide that has and a lot the 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:27.070
 previous is completely cleaning the 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:30.610
 last two I need it from the two 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:33.880
 the last ones are dirty 1024 23 I do not 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:37.840
 I'm wrong and the two previous ones I'm going to 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:41.590
 finish giving the last last rub 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:43.810
 well as I say in summary a cleaner 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.670
 metal for which I am not that there 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:47.740
 You are in Spain because any empire 

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:50.710
 of metals in this case green forest of 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:54.550
 Mercadona has this very cheap product 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:57.010
 when it looks and we can clean our 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:59.110
 guitar especially our fret for 

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:02.100
 that guitar that without being forgotten 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.100
 what we need 

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.510
