look exactly like the one that he worse

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.580 
look exactly like the one that he worse
cuz<00:01:11.670> his<00:01:12.180> is<00:01:12.360> actually<00:01:12.510> real<00:01:12.990> snake<00:01:13.320> skin

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590

because<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.490> can<00:01:14.580> actually<00:01:14.850> afford<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.710> mine

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
because you can actually afford it mine

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.600 
because you can actually afford it mine
it's<00:01:17.310> just<00:01:18.860> fabric<00:01:19.860> that's<00:01:20.100> pretty<00:01:20.490> much

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
it's just fabric that's pretty much

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.789 
it's just fabric that's pretty much
limited<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.180> look<00:01:21.390> like<00:01:21.570> snake<00:01:21.780> skin<00:01:21.810> but<00:01:22.439> it

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
limited to look like snake skin but it

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.640 
limited to look like snake skin but it
has<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.250> bumps<00:01:23.780> that<00:01:24.780> makes<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.619> know

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
has the bumps that makes it you know

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.600 
has the bumps that makes it you know
sort<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.509> believable<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.750> guess<00:01:28.460> and<00:01:29.460> the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
sort of believable I guess and the

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.219 
sort of believable I guess and the
texture<00:01:29.909> looks<00:01:30.180> different<00:01:30.509> from<00:01:30.600> his<00:01:30.810> hat

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
texture looks different from his hat

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.649 
texture looks different from his hat
but<00:01:32.220> anyways<00:01:32.579> like<00:01:32.790> for<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.090> price<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.450> paid

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
but anyways like for the price I paid

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.840 
but anyways like for the price I paid
for<00:01:33.960> this<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.770> can't<00:01:35.159> really<00:01:35.280> argue<00:01:35.549> with<00:01:35.640> the

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
for this I can't really argue with the

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:36.289 
for this I can't really argue with the
results

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
results

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.450

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
his version of the Hat would probably

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.800 
his version of the Hat would probably
cost<00:01:38.640> anywhere<00:01:39.030> from<00:01:39.090> two<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.540> three<00:01:39.780> hundred

cost anywhere from two to three hundred

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.980 
cost anywhere from two to three hundred
dollars<00:01:40.049> even<00:01:40.770> more<00:01:41.009> because<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:42.210> know<00:01:42.329> snake

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
dollars even more because you know snake
