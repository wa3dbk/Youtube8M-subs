00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
again this is gonna crackle hopefully

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.730 
again this is gonna crackle hopefully
like<00:02:34.300> this<00:02:34.540> alright<00:02:35.530> so<00:02:35.740> you<00:02:36.700> put<00:02:36.880> the<00:02:37.000> glue<00:02:37.180> on

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
like this alright so you put the glue on

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.200 
like this alright so you put the glue on
all<00:02:38.740> over<00:02:39.070> okay

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
all over okay

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.420 
all over okay
pretty<00:02:40.420> thick<00:02:40.690> them<00:02:40.840> out<00:02:41.020> you<00:02:41.980> put<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:42.190> glue

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
pretty thick them out you put the glue

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.620 
pretty thick them out you put the glue
on<00:02:42.550> the<00:02:42.670> top<00:02:43.500> okay<00:02:44.500> then<00:02:45.220> you<00:02:45.490> sort<00:02:45.790> of<00:02:45.940> just

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
on the top okay then you sort of just

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.980 
on the top okay then you sort of just
paint<00:02:46.960> the<00:02:47.860> glue<00:02:48.160> all<00:02:48.430> over<00:02:49.210> where<00:02:49.600> you<00:02:49.750> want

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
paint the glue all over where you want

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.380 
paint the glue all over where you want
it<00:02:50.140> now<00:02:50.350> some<00:02:51.040> people<00:02:51.280> just<00:02:51.460> paint<00:02:51.730> it<00:02:51.820> on<00:02:51.850> like

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
it now some people just paint it on like

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.290 
it now some people just paint it on like
this<00:02:52.810> and<00:02:53.110> some<00:02:53.950> people<00:02:53.980> paint<00:02:54.520> it<00:02:54.670> on<00:02:54.850> both

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
this and some people paint it on both

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.570 
this and some people paint it on both
ways<00:02:55.600> and<00:02:55.990> so<00:02:56.470> I<00:02:56.500> want<00:02:56.830> my<00:02:56.920> crackling<00:02:57.280> to<00:02:57.400> sort

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
ways and so I want my crackling to sort

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.370 
ways and so I want my crackling to sort
of<00:02:57.700> be<00:02:57.790> all<00:02:57.940> over<00:02:58.210> I<00:02:58.240> think<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:58.900> pattern<00:02:59.260> of

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
of be all over I think the pattern of

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.230 
of be all over I think the pattern of
the<00:02:59.440> crackle<00:02:59.830> sort<00:03:00.070> of<00:03:00.190> follows<00:03:00.640> sort<00:03:01.060> of<00:03:01.150> you

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
the crackle sort of follows sort of you

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.590 
the crackle sort of follows sort of you
know<00:03:01.270> where<00:03:01.510> you<00:03:01.660> go<00:03:01.900> with<00:03:02.050> it<00:03:02.520> um<00:03:03.520> this<00:03:04.300> is<00:03:04.450> on

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
know where you go with it um this is on

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.690 
know where you go with it um this is on
pretty<00:03:04.810> thick<00:03:05.280> you<00:03:06.280> might<00:03:06.430> wanna<00:03:06.550> use<00:03:06.610> a

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
pretty thick you might wanna use a

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.190 
pretty thick you might wanna use a
little<00:03:07.060> bit<00:03:07.180> less<00:03:07.390> but<00:03:07.570> I<00:03:07.630> think<00:03:07.840> this<00:03:07.960> will<00:03:08.080> be

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
little bit less but I think this will be

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.820 
little bit less but I think this will be
I<00:03:08.350> think<00:03:08.380> this<00:03:08.680> will<00:03:08.830> still<00:03:09.070> work<00:03:09.100> okay<00:03:10.830> so

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
I think this will still work okay so

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.520 
I think this will still work okay so
here's<00:03:12.670> the<00:03:12.760> glue<00:03:13.120> and<00:03:13.420> I<00:03:13.570> do<00:03:13.630> I<00:03:13.960> did<00:03:14.080> one<00:03:14.350> at<00:03:14.440> a

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
here's the glue and I do I did one at a

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.170 
here's the glue and I do I did one at a
time<00:03:14.710> on<00:03:14.770> this<00:03:14.980> other<00:03:15.190> one<00:03:15.400> that<00:03:15.430> I<00:03:15.610> showed<00:03:15.970> you

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
time on this other one that I showed you

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.720 
time on this other one that I showed you
I<00:03:16.360> did<00:03:16.570> one<00:03:16.780> side<00:03:16.960> at<00:03:17.110> a<00:03:17.170> time<00:03:17.200> so<00:03:17.800> you<00:03:18.580> know

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
I did one side at a time so you know

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.670 
I did one side at a time so you know
however<00:03:19.270> you<00:03:19.510> want<00:03:19.690> to<00:03:19.720> do<00:03:19.900> it<00:03:20.050> and<00:03:20.170> I<00:03:20.200> just<00:03:20.410> go

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
however you want to do it and I just go

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.620 
however you want to do it and I just go
over<00:03:20.980> it<00:03:21.040> a<00:03:21.100> couple<00:03:21.280> times<00:03:22.590> okay<00:03:24.030> all<00:03:25.030> right<00:03:25.240> so

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
over it a couple times okay all right so

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.830 
over it a couple times okay all right so
there<00:03:26.080> is<00:03:26.410> the<00:03:26.890> glue<00:03:27.160> on<00:03:27.460> there<00:03:27.880> now<00:03:28.150> this

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
there is the glue on there now this

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.590 
there is the glue on there now this
can't<00:03:29.170> dry<00:03:29.560> okay<00:03:30.190> this<00:03:30.400> it's<00:03:30.910> you<00:03:31.180> need<00:03:31.330> to<00:03:31.450> do

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
this pink on the photo girl I think I do

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.060 
this pink on the photo girl I think I do
I<00:05:42.120> might<00:05:42.690> mix<00:05:42.960> it<00:05:43.139> with<00:05:43.259> white<00:05:43.530> to<00:05:43.740> be<00:05:43.860> a<00:05:43.889> little

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
I might mix it with white to be a little

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.430 
I might mix it with white to be a little
more<00:05:44.220> pastel<00:05:44.669> on<00:05:44.850> my<00:05:44.940> next<00:05:45.240> one<00:05:45.419> this<00:05:46.139> is<00:05:46.410> a

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
more pastel on my next one this is a

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.680 
more pastel on my next one this is a
little<00:05:46.770> darker<00:05:47.070> like<00:05:47.220> a<00:05:47.250> little<00:05:47.880> more<00:05:48.180> sort<00:05:48.570> of

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
little darker like a little more sort of

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.790 
little darker like a little more sort of
whitish<00:05:48.990> cast<00:05:49.500> Elish<00:05:51.320> but<00:05:52.320> this<00:05:52.440> is<00:05:52.560> gonna<00:05:52.710> I

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 
whitish cast Elish but this is gonna I

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.250 
whitish cast Elish but this is gonna I
think<00:05:53.010> get<00:05:53.190> the<00:05:53.310> same<00:05:53.550> effect<00:05:54.090> so<00:05:54.180> again<00:05:54.570> the

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:55.260 
think get the same effect so again the

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.830 
think get the same effect so again the
glue<00:05:55.590> cannot<00:05:56.460> dry<00:05:56.729> before<00:05:57.120> you<00:05:57.270> put<00:05:57.300> it<00:05:57.690> on

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
glue cannot dry before you put it on

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.719 
glue cannot dry before you put it on
that's<00:05:58.229> what<00:05:58.410> I<00:05:58.440> think<00:05:58.770> does<00:05:58.949> it<00:05:58.979> separating

00:05:59.719 --> 00:05:59.729 
that's what I think does it separating

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:05.670 
that's what I think does it separating
because<00:05:59.940> it's<00:06:00.090> still<00:06:00.300> wet

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680
