 studio being part of stock sharp tom 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.080
 sharp studio is a visual medium 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.180
 for creating you with themes and management

 trading strategies that are created 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.880

 create stock strategies shark studio 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.350
 in two ways 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:35.240
 way number one strategy is created from 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.920
 code code is dynamically compiled into 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.760
 stock sharp studio he can 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.340
 edit 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:44.330
 adding or removing any necessary 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.070
 components method number two directly from 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.590
 ready files or dynamic 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.930
 load them builds the case files which already 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.930
 contains ready-made strategy code 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:01.890
 we choose the way number one choose 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:08.549
 we need a template sliding 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:11.130
 averages create a name that appears 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.869
 in the window we see the code that is displayed 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.180
 special graphic editor 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.810
 allowing us to edit code a 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:24.240
 also graphic highlighting 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:33.210
 necessary constructions for example if we 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:36.630
 let's make a mistake here then editor us 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:40.259
 will highlight a certain erroneous code and 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:43.700
 This error occurs compilation 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:48.110
 error lines to fix it 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:53.509
 return the code and compile 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.509
 compilation was successful 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.600
 This strategy is ready to go 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:05.540
 run a strategy on real data 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.540
 need to connect

 when you first start it is offered 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:16.010
 create the next choice available to us 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:19.099

 deceit and edge and Interactive Brokers and 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.920
 to the direct connection of Plaza 2 to be 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.390
 demonstrations choose plaza 2 as he 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.269
 does not require installed software 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.230
 ensure the connection goes to 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.230
 local router 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:46.129
 after the connection is configured 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.879
 need to click on the connect button 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:52.790
 re after connection was 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:54.560
 installed through it the current ball studio 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.859
 loads all the data that 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.109
 provide this connection to this 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:03.739
 case we are interested in portfolios and 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:05.720
 tools all tools are loaded from 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.640
 connections initially fall 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.069
 intermediate storage where we can 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.730
 look for the tool we need and 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:17.780
 edit its special panel 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:21.790
 In this case, we choose the index of the RTTS and he 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.790
 will be available for work 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:35.799
 next we need to tie our 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.799
 portfolio and instrument strategy 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.520
 now we bind them 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.349
 each strategy has its own separate 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.430
 graphic area which is divided into 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:56.160

 this graphic area is divided into 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:09.350
 three areas graph candle equity and 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.670

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.100
 another area 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.530
 this is the application table and done before 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:19.019
 how to run the strategy we need 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.150
 set the path to the story which will

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.790
 historical data occurs in 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:35.310
 special window where we can choose 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:41.490

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.050
 add it for testing 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.289
 select the required data range 

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:46.070
 set the data range and the following

 candlelight strategy 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:55.940
 so we set a timeframe of five 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:57.740
 minutes if left unchanged it 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.009
