well yes there are and you should be
very<00:01:41.619> concerned<00:01:41.940> because<00:01:42.940> our<00:01:43.330> current<00:01:43.780> solar

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
very concerned because our current solar

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.309 
very concerned because our current solar
cycle<00:01:44.679> will<00:01:44.950> reach<00:01:45.220> its<00:01:45.399> maximum<00:01:45.909> in<00:01:46.270> 2012<00:01:46.990> and

cycle will reach its maximum in 2012 and

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:49.830 
cycle will reach its maximum in 2012 and
if<00:01:48.250> what<00:01:48.460> the<00:01:48.580> scientists<00:01:49.060> are<00:01:49.299> telling<00:01:49.509> us

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
if what the scientists are telling us

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.710 
if what the scientists are telling us
holds<00:01:50.259> true<00:01:50.530> that's<00:01:51.220> when<00:01:51.580> all<00:01:51.759> hell<00:01:51.909> breaks

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
holds true that's when all hell breaks

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.130 
holds true that's when all hell breaks
loose<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:54.640> what<00:01:54.970> will<00:01:55.209> all<00:01:55.450> hell<00:01:55.780> breaking

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
loose so what will all hell breaking

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.059 
loose so what will all hell breaking
loose<00:01:56.319> look<00:01:56.860> like<00:01:57.069> in<00:01:57.340> 2012<00:01:58.080> well<00:01:59.080> we<00:01:59.890> have<00:02:00.039> a
