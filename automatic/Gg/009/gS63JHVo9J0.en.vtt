00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
second cooldown so it's going to be gone

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.580 
second cooldown so it's going to be gone
and<00:02:05.700> reduce<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.240> channeling<00:02:06.719> time<00:02:06.930> by<00:02:07.320> fifty

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
and reduce the channeling time by fifty

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.949 
and reduce the channeling time by fifty
percent<00:02:07.710> which<00:02:08.310> is<00:02:08.459> huge<00:02:08.759> because<00:02:09.000> like<00:02:09.330> when

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
percent which is huge because like when

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.960 
percent which is huge because like when
you're<00:02:10.220> dpsing<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.760> have<00:02:11.879> to<00:02:12.000> stop

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
you're dpsing and you have to stop

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.210 
you're dpsing and you have to stop
okay<00:02:13.090> and<00:02:13.390> like<00:02:13.900> however<00:02:14.500> long<00:02:14.710> it<00:02:14.830> lasts<00:02:15.010> I

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
okay and like however long it lasts I

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.800 
okay and like however long it lasts I
know<00:02:15.280> it's<00:02:15.490> just<00:02:15.580> like<00:02:15.700> really<00:02:16.150> long<00:02:16.360> time<00:02:16.510> I

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
know it's just like really long time I

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.440 
know it's just like really long time I
think<00:02:16.870> like<00:02:17.080> eight<00:02:17.230> seconds<00:02:17.740> or<00:02:17.860> something

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
think like eight seconds or something

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.090 
think like eight seconds or something
you're<00:02:19.450> not<00:02:19.600> dpsing<00:02:20.020> it<00:02:20.260> at<00:02:20.350> all<00:02:20.470> and<00:02:20.800> if

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
you're not dpsing it at all and if

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.370 
you're not dpsing it at all and if
anything<00:02:21.880> happens<00:02:22.330> in<00:02:22.480> that<00:02:22.600> boss<00:02:22.840> mechanic

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
anything happens in that boss mechanic

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.470 
anything happens in that boss mechanic
where<00:02:23.680> it's<00:02:24.130> going<00:02:24.520> to<00:02:24.610> make<00:02:24.730> you<00:02:24.940> interrupt

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
where it's going to make you interrupt

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.780 
where it's going to make you interrupt
your<00:02:25.630> cast<00:02:26.320> you<00:02:26.590> just<00:02:26.860> now<00:02:27.010> waste<00:02:27.280> at<00:02:27.400> sixteen

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
your cast you just now waste at sixteen

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.790 
your cast you just now waste at sixteen
seconds<00:02:28.240> so<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:29.320> fact<00:02:29.530> that<00:02:29.590> they're

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
seconds so the fact that they're

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.050 
seconds so the fact that they're
reducing<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.280> channel<00:02:30.550> time<00:02:30.700> by<00:02:30.820> fifty

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
reducing the channel time by fifty

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.750 
reducing the channel time by fifty
percent<00:02:31.210> is<00:02:31.510> huge<00:02:32.020> but<00:02:32.680> with<00:02:33.280> that<00:02:33.490> they're

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
percent is huge but with that they're

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.460 
percent is huge but with that they're
changing<00:02:34.600> it<00:02:34.750> to<00:02:34.960> where<00:02:35.110> it<00:02:35.170> only<00:02:35.260> gives<00:02:35.380> you

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
changing it to where it only gives you

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.050 
changing it to where it only gives you
fifteen<00:02:35.770> percent<00:02:36.040> increase<00:02:36.430> damage<00:02:36.640> and

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
fifteen percent increase damage and

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.420 
fifteen percent increase damage and
instead<00:02:38.050> of<00:02:38.140> twenty<00:02:38.380> five<00:02:38.530> percent<00:02:38.560> but

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
instead of twenty five percent but

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.810 
instead of twenty five percent but
they're<00:02:40.180> increasing<00:02:40.900> it<00:02:41.050> to<00:02:41.320> the<00:02:41.800> last<00:02:42.430> for

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
they're increasing it to the last for

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.700 
they're increasing it to the last for
one<00:02:42.940> minute<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:43.330> it<00:02:43.510> was<00:02:43.660> 40<00:02:43.990> seconds<00:02:44.380> so

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
one minute and it was 40 seconds so

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.910 
one minute and it was 40 seconds so
that's<00:02:45.750> I'm<00:02:46.750> still<00:02:47.140> trying<00:02:47.350> to<00:02:47.380> figure<00:02:47.440> out<00:02:47.650> if

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
that's I'm still trying to figure out if

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.940 
that's I'm still trying to figure out if
that<00:02:48.730> I<00:02:49.090> think<00:02:49.510> it<00:02:49.600> is<00:02:49.630> a<00:02:49.750> nerf<00:02:50.020> I<00:02:50.350> mean<00:02:50.800> it

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
that I think it is a nerf I mean it

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.740 
that I think it is a nerf I mean it
clearly<00:02:51.790> it's<00:02:51.910> ten<00:02:52.030> percent<00:02:52.300> less<00:02:52.480> but<00:02:52.720> you

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
clearly it's ten percent less but you

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.750 
clearly it's ten percent less but you
don't<00:02:52.990> have<00:02:53.080> to<00:02:53.140> do<00:02:53.290> it<00:02:53.380> as<00:02:53.470> much<00:02:53.709> you<00:02:54.610> don't

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
don't have to do it as much you don't

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.940 
don't have to do it as much you don't
have<00:02:54.910> a<00:02:54.970> longer<00:02:55.209> channeling<00:02:55.959> time<00:02:56.110> and<00:02:56.410> the

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
have a longer channeling time and the

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.560 
have a longer channeling time and the
Buffs<00:02:57.160> up<00:02:57.310> for<00:02:57.459> 20<00:02:57.640> more<00:02:57.700> seconds<00:02:58.030> so<00:02:58.120> I<00:02:58.150> think

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
Buffs up for 20 more seconds so I think

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.480 
Buffs up for 20 more seconds so I think
it<00:02:58.720> over<00:02:58.930> all<00:02:59.290> is<00:02:59.470> going<00:02:59.680> to<00:02:59.740> be<00:02:59.860> a<00:02:59.890> lot<00:03:00.220> better

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
it over all is going to be a lot better

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.820 
it over all is going to be a lot better
so<00:03:01.209> I'm<00:03:01.750> pretty<00:03:01.959> excited<00:03:02.080> for<00:03:02.530> that<00:03:02.650> change

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
so I'm pretty excited for that change

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.180 
so I'm pretty excited for that change
actually<00:03:03.340> um<00:03:04.230> greater<00:03:05.230> invisibility<00:03:05.680> now<00:03:06.040> has

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
actually um greater invisibility now has

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.890 
actually um greater invisibility now has
a<00:03:06.220> 90<00:03:06.520> second<00:03:06.790> cooldown<00:03:06.970> which<00:03:07.420> a<00:03:07.540> minute<00:03:07.840> and

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
a 90 second cooldown which a minute and

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.620 
a 90 second cooldown which a minute and
a<00:03:07.959> half<00:03:07.990> used<00:03:08.800> to<00:03:08.920> be<00:03:09.040> 2.5<00:03:09.580> minutes<00:03:09.790> that<00:03:10.360> is<00:03:10.600> a

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
a half used to be 2.5 minutes that is a

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.230 
a half used to be 2.5 minutes that is a
that's<00:03:11.440> I<00:03:11.800> mean<00:03:12.580> no<00:03:12.700> one's<00:03:12.850> really<00:03:12.970> going<00:03:13.060> to

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
that's I mean no one's really going to

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.030 
that's I mean no one's really going to
take<00:03:13.360> that<00:03:13.540> but<00:03:14.230> it<00:03:14.830> is<00:03:15.130> above<00:03:15.400> I<00:03:16.890> really<00:03:17.890> don't

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
take that but it is above I really don't

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.800 
take that but it is above I really don't
see<00:03:18.070> anyone<00:03:18.370> using<00:03:18.610> that<00:03:18.700> that's<00:03:18.910> a<00:03:19.120> maybe<00:03:19.630> in

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
see anyone using that that's a maybe in

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.800 
see anyone using that that's a maybe in
PvE<00:03:20.080> standpoint<00:03:20.440> but<00:03:20.920> that's<00:03:21.280> about<00:03:21.519> it<00:03:21.810> frost

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
PvE standpoint but that's about it frost

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.030 
PvE standpoint but that's about it frost
ball<00:03:22.930> caps<00:03:23.110> my<00:03:23.230> mirror<00:03:23.410> images<00:03:23.739> New<00:03:23.860> I'll<00:03:23.920> do

ball caps my mirror images New I'll do

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.740 
ball caps my mirror images New I'll do
fifty<00:03:24.250> percent<00:03:24.519> more<00:03:24.670> damage<00:03:25.000> that's<00:03:25.540> nice

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
fifty percent more damage that's nice

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.110 
fifty percent more damage that's nice
because<00:03:26.050> the<00:03:27.040> damage<00:03:27.220> is<00:03:27.519> already<00:03:27.730> really

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
because the damage is already really

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.390 
because the damage is already really
horrible<00:03:28.570> but<00:03:28.930> pretty<00:03:29.860> much<00:03:29.920> everyone<00:03:30.190> just

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
horrible but pretty much everyone just

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.070 
horrible but pretty much everyone just
uses<00:03:30.610> that<00:03:30.760> to<00:03:30.940> drop<00:03:31.209> their<00:03:31.480> a<00:03:32.130> target<00:03:33.130> but

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
uses that to drop their a target but

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.930 
uses that to drop their a target but
more<00:03:35.080> damage<00:03:35.320> i'll<00:03:35.440> take<00:03:35.590> it<00:03:35.940> improved

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
more damage i'll take it improved

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.270 
more damage i'll take it improved

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
just no longer have a silence so like

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.320 
just no longer have a silence so like
like<00:03:49.090> that<00:03:49.450> is<00:03:49.600> so<00:03:50.049> huge<00:03:50.709> is<00:03:51.160> like<00:03:51.310> the<00:03:51.700> worst

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
like that is so huge is like the worst

like that is so huge is like the worst
nerf<00:03:52.750> I<00:03:53.080> think<00:03:53.290> I've<00:03:53.380> ever<00:03:53.590> seen<00:03:54.570> before<00:03:55.620> mages

what they do to that cold snap now heals
a<00:04:34.440> mage<00:04:34.620> for<00:04:34.830> fifteen<00:04:35.099> percent<00:04:35.370> of<00:04:35.520> the

again<00:04:38.220> nerfing<00:04:39.180> mages<00:04:39.659> even<00:04:40.560> harder<00:04:41.039> I<00:04:41.909> guess

00:04:42.619 --> 00:04:42.629 
again nerfing mages even harder I guess

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:45.020 
again nerfing mages even harder I guess
that<00:04:42.810> makes<00:04:42.960> cauterize<00:04:43.680> more<00:04:44.039> viable<00:04:44.310> on<00:04:44.819> the

that makes cauterize more viable on the
plus<00:04:45.240> side<00:04:45.449> but<00:04:45.990> I<00:04:46.470> think<00:04:47.129> I'll<00:04:47.220> still<00:04:47.490> take

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
plus side but I think I'll still take

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:49.460 
plus side but I think I'll still take
cold<00:04:48.060> snap<00:04:48.330> me<00:04:48.509> fifteen<00:04:48.960> percent<00:04:49.229> heels

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
might make it a little bit more viable

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.459 
might make it a little bit more viable

up<00:05:44.039> to<00:05:44.159> three<00:05:44.340> times<00:05:44.370> that<00:05:45.000> like<00:05:45.270> each

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:45.449 
up to three times that like each

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:49.279 
up to three times that like each
subsequent<00:05:46.819> sequential<00:05:48.020> frostbolt<00:05:49.020> the

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:49.289 
subsequent sequential frostbolt the

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:51.680 
subsequent sequential frostbolt the
would<00:05:49.860> do<00:05:50.039> more<00:05:50.729> damage<00:05:50.909> but<00:05:51.300> now<00:05:51.419> they<00:05:51.659> just

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
would do more damage but now they just

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.959 
would do more damage but now they just
buffed<00:05:52.169> it<00:05:52.289> how<00:05:52.590> it<00:05:52.710> used<00:05:52.860> to<00:05:52.949> be<00:05:53.099> and<00:05:53.370> I'm<00:05:53.729> cool

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:53.969 
buffed it how it used to be and I'm cool

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:55.939 
buffed it how it used to be and I'm cool
with<00:05:54.000> that<00:05:54.210> because<00:05:54.419> how<00:05:55.050> often<00:05:55.289> honestly<00:05:55.800> did

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:55.949 
with that because how often honestly did

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:57.950 
with that because how often honestly did
you<00:05:56.069> have<00:05:56.250> two<00:05:56.879> or<00:05:57.150> three<00:05:57.180> stacks<00:05:57.659> of<00:05:57.870> the

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
you have two or three stacks of the

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.680 
you have two or three stacks of the
debuff<00:05:58.259> on<00:05:58.409> a<00:05:58.440> target<00:05:58.680> never<00:05:59.219> so<00:05:59.759> if<00:06:00.060> they<00:06:00.569> just

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
debuff on a target never so if they just

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:01.909 
debuff on a target never so if they just
increase<00:06:01.110> the<00:06:01.139> damage<00:06:01.349> or<00:06:01.620> twenty<00:06:01.800> four

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 
increase the damage or twenty four

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:05.869 
increase the damage or twenty four
percent<00:06:02.039> that's<00:06:02.340> pretty<00:06:02.580> much<00:06:02.639> a<00:06:02.759> buff<00:06:03.000> oh<00:06:04.879> and

00:06:05.869 --> 00:06:05.879 
percent that's pretty much a buff oh and

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:07.939 
percent that's pretty much a buff oh and
your<00:06:06.659> pet<00:06:06.870> freeze<00:06:07.169> no<00:06:07.349> longer<00:06:07.620> does<00:06:07.710> damage

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:07.949 
your pet freeze no longer does damage

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:09.320 
your pet freeze no longer does damage
which<00:06:08.250> means<00:06:08.460> it<00:06:08.550> won't<00:06:08.639> break<00:06:08.879> any<00:06:09.090> of<00:06:09.180> your

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
which means it won't break any of your

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:14.450 
which means it won't break any of your
CC<00:06:09.659> so<00:06:09.990> that<00:06:10.289> is<00:06:10.590> sweet<00:06:11.460> so<00:06:11.849> I<00:06:12.779> mean<00:06:13.460> overall

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 
CC so that is sweet so I mean overall

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.450 
CC so that is sweet so I mean overall
it's<00:06:14.909> pretty<00:06:15.419> horrible<00:06:15.990> for<00:06:16.229> mages<00:06:16.409> but<00:06:16.979> I

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 
it's pretty horrible for mages but I

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.670 
it's pretty horrible for mages but I
think<00:06:18.449> some<00:06:18.870> of<00:06:18.900> the<00:06:19.080> but<00:06:19.259> some<00:06:19.500> of<00:06:19.620> the

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 
think some of the but some of the

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.830 
think some of the but some of the
changes<00:06:19.800> are<00:06:20.129> good<00:06:20.279> and<00:06:20.699> I<00:06:21.029> just<00:06:21.539> pray<00:06:21.810> that

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 
changes are good and I just pray that

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.600 
changes are good and I just pray that
they<00:06:22.669> do<00:06:23.669> not<00:06:23.849> take<00:06:24.210> away<00:06:24.330> our<00:06:24.509> silence<00:06:25.610> if

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 
they do not take away our silence if

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.139 
they do not take away our silence if
they<00:06:26.849> do<00:06:26.909> I<00:06:27.360> mean<00:06:27.719> it<00:06:28.409> is<00:06:28.590> what<00:06:28.710> it<00:06:28.830> is<00:06:28.879> but<00:06:29.879> I

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:30.149 
they do I mean it is what it is but I

00:06:30.149 --> 00:06:33.050 
they do I mean it is what it is but I
really<00:06:30.479> hope<00:06:30.630> they<00:06:30.779> change<00:06:30.990> that<00:06:31.320> and<00:06:32.060> that's

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 
really hope they change that and that's

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.330
