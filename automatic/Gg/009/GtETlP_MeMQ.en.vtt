00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.830 
it is a lot lighter it is kind of thick
I<00:01:49.170> would<00:01:49.350> say<00:01:49.590> but<00:01:49.649> it's<00:01:50.100> not<00:01:50.340> like<00:01:50.579> an<00:01:50.840> oily

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
I would say but it's not like an oily

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.130 
I would say but it's not like an oily
thick<00:01:52.520> so<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.579> gives<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.180> coverage<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:55.020> it's

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
thick so it gives you coverage and it's

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.649 
thick so it gives you coverage and it's
really<00:01:55.350> smooth<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:56.610> has<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.790> nice<00:01:57.000> smell<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.630> it

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
really smooth it has a nice smell to it

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.010 
really smooth it has a nice smell to it
i<00:01:57.990> think<00:01:58.049> i<00:01:58.469> would<00:01:58.590> recommend<00:01:59.250> this<00:01:59.430> BB<00:01:59.850> cream

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
i think i would recommend this BB cream

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.730 
i think i would recommend this BB cream
more<00:02:01.020> for<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.710> summer<00:02:02.189> because<00:02:03.110> it<00:02:04.110> feels<00:02:04.530> a

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
more for the summer because it feels a

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:05.920 
more for the summer because it feels a
lot<00:02:04.890> lighter

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
lot lighter

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.249 
lot lighter
and<00:02:06.070> the<00:02:07.070> mission<00:02:07.370> of<00:02:07.580> BB<00:02:07.880> cream<00:02:08.170> and<00:02:09.170> the

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
and the mission of BB cream and the

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.230 
and the mission of BB cream and the
Michigan<00:02:09.740> cream<00:02:10.039> have<00:02:10.369> some<00:02:10.670> water<00:02:10.910> the

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
Michigan cream have some water the

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.120 
Michigan cream have some water the
oiliness<00:02:11.660> to<00:02:12.050> it<00:02:12.200> so<00:02:12.380> I<00:02:12.410> think<00:02:12.710> it<00:02:12.800> would<00:02:12.920> work

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
oiliness to it so I think it would work

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.120 
oiliness to it so I think it would work
great<00:02:13.610> for<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:14.000> winter<00:02:14.330> so<00:02:15.260> I<00:02:15.290> mean<00:02:15.650> they<00:02:15.920> both

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
great for the winter so I mean they both

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.280 
great for the winter so I mean they both

a<00:04:36.260> both<00:04:36.590> this<00:04:37.220> one<00:04:37.430> smells<00:04:37.580> a<00:04:37.820> little<00:04:37.910> fresher
