00:00:00.191 --> 00:00:04.534
 (playing live piano music) 

00:00:04.534 --> 00:00:08.848
 Y: "I won't do boring art anymore." 

00:00:09.401 --> 00:00:12.652
 X: "I won't do boring art anymore." 

00:00:12.652 --> 00:00:15.319
 Y: It's happening over and over again 

00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:17.155
 over the whole paper 

00:00:17.155 --> 00:00:20.390
 and originally across the wall 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.727
 column behind column. 

00:00:22.727 --> 00:00:26.665
 X: It is clearly a school punishment. 

00:00:26.665 --> 00:00:28.901
 "I will not forget to do a homework," 

00:00:28.901 --> 00:00:31.168
 written over and over. 

00:00:31.168 --> 00:00:38.126
 Y: We are talking about a work of art created by artist John Baldessari in 1971 

00:00:38.126 --> 00:00:42.450
 for the first time at the College of Art and Design in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.077
 X: This type is a long time ago known as a school punishment. 

00:00:47.085 --> 00:00:51.034
 How did he transform him into art? 

00:00:51.034 --> 00:00:53.923
 I think the intention was to put it in the gallery 

00:00:53.923 --> 00:00:55.827
 for the artist, the context was important. 

00:00:55.827 --> 00:01:02.060
 He even talked about how he took pictures of words and transferred them to the canvas, 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.235
 to include them in the relationship system. 

00:01:04.235 --> 00:01:08.075
 So I agree, it was different than on the school board. 

00:01:08.075 --> 00:01:10.007
 X: Let's look at the words for a while. 

00:01:10.007 --> 00:01:12.201
 He does not write: "I will not shout in the class." 

00:01:12.201 --> 00:01:14.867
 He writes, "I'm not going to be boring anymore." 

00:01:14.867 --> 00:01:16.449
 He punishes himself. 

00:01:16.449 --> 00:01:18.751
 She watches her career and says: 

00:01:18.751 --> 00:01:23.021
 "I was a bad art, but I won't be doing boring art in the future." 

00:01:23.034 --> 00:01:27.536
 Y: Apparently he wrote this sentence in his diary. 

00:01:27.559 --> 00:01:29.201
 And so it came about. 

00:01:29.201 --> 00:01:34.103
 It is important to understand the work in the broader context of his early work. 

00:01:34.116 --> 00:01:41.167
 Baldessari - like other art students - learned to work in abstract expression style. 

00:01:41.171 --> 00:01:45.953
 X: We're talking about Mark Rothk, about Jackson Pollock ... 

00:01:45.953 --> 00:01:50.557
 About artists who did art that was taken seriously in the 1950s. 

00:01:50.582 --> 00:01:57.823
 Y: In the 1970s, this author collected all his canvases. 

00:01:57.823 --> 00:02:00.107
 They were abstractions, landscapes, ... 

00:02:00.118 --> 00:02:06.236
 And then he took a couple of friends and art students to the crematorium 

00:02:06.236 --> 00:02:08.667
 and those images burned like bodies. 

00:02:08.667 --> 00:02:12.618
 And then he took the ashes and poured them into the urn. 

00:02:12.618 --> 00:02:19.053
 I think he made a thick line behind his old style 

00:02:19.053 --> 00:02:24.002
 and his mature work has focused much more on the concept. 

00:02:24.002 --> 00:02:29.316
 X: Art was still associated with painting, even in the 1960s. 

00:02:29.316 --> 00:02:30.660
 Painting is art. 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.946
 In "I won't do boring art anymore" it calls it boring 

00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:38.176
 and he says, "From now on I'll do something else." 

00:02:38.176 --> 00:02:41.667
 Y: Even using the word "boring" is terribly funny - and inadmissible! 

00:02:41.667 --> 00:02:42.930
 X: Yes. (laughter) 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.714
 X: Because in the serious art world, words are not used as "boring". 

00:02:47.722 --> 00:02:53.184
 In this deep irony there is some kind of straightness and humor. 

00:02:53.201 --> 00:02:56.573
 X: The real challenge for artists was: 

00:02:56.573 --> 00:02:58.989
 What is the essence of interesting art? 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.316
 What does it mean to do honest, engaging, smart, new art? 

00:03:04.316 --> 00:03:09.000
 Y: It was also about the qualities of the new conceptual art. 

00:03:09.007 --> 00:03:12.461
 When you think about things like personalities like Sol Lewitt, 

00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:14.456
 they are somehow cool to understand 

00:03:14.456 --> 00:03:16.674
 which is also boring, 

00:03:16.674 --> 00:03:18.627
 although you must not say it aloud. 

00:03:18.627 --> 00:03:21.531
 So there's something incredibly ironic about it, 

00:03:21.531 --> 00:03:23.699
 but also disrespectful. 

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:27.699
