00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:10.400 
hey guys crazy are born here just want

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.820 
hey guys crazy are born here just want
to<00:00:10.490> do<00:00:10.580> a<00:00:10.610> quick<00:00:10.969> tip<00:00:11.290> this<00:00:12.290> is<00:00:12.410> something<00:00:12.740> they

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:12.830 
to do a quick tip this is something they

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.310 
to do a quick tip this is something they
added<00:00:13.129> recently<00:00:13.340> so<00:00:14.150> I<00:00:14.180> don't<00:00:14.660> know<00:00:15.200> if

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320 
added recently so I don't know if

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.519 
added recently so I don't know if
everybody<00:00:15.769> uses<00:00:16.189> it<00:00:16.219> or<00:00:16.550> knows<00:00:16.730> about<00:00:16.970> it<00:00:17.029> but

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:17.529 
everybody uses it or knows about it but

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:22.600 
everybody uses it or knows about it but
basically<00:00:18.730> the<00:00:19.730> tip<00:00:19.939> is<00:00:20.259> that<00:00:21.490> when<00:00:22.490> you're

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:22.610 
basically the tip is that when you're

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.769 
basically the tip is that when you're
flying<00:00:22.820> you<00:00:23.360> should<00:00:23.689> maximize<00:00:24.560> your<00:00:24.919> mini-map

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:25.779 
flying you should maximize your mini-map

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:28.569 
flying you should maximize your mini-map
and<00:00:26.779> by<00:00:27.320> maximize<00:00:27.770> I<00:00:27.860> don't<00:00:28.040> mean<00:00:28.160> hitting<00:00:28.340> H

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:28.579 
and by maximize I don't mean hitting H

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:30.519 
and by maximize I don't mean hitting H
which<00:00:29.149> H<00:00:29.360> is<00:00:29.390> really<00:00:29.779> nice<00:00:29.899> too<00:00:30.110> i<00:00:30.140> know<00:00:30.320> some

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
which H is really nice too i know some

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.139 
which H is really nice too i know some
people<00:00:30.559> pull<00:00:31.099> that<00:00:31.279> up<00:00:31.309> and<00:00:31.610> fly<00:00:31.820> around<00:00:31.880> like

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
people pull that up and fly around like

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.720 
people pull that up and fly around like
that<00:00:32.390> so<00:00:32.570> they<00:00:32.660> can<00:00:32.840> see<00:00:33.079> more<00:00:33.260> but<00:00:33.680> it<00:00:34.190> takes<00:00:34.579> a

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
that so they can see more but it takes a

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.100 
that so they can see more but it takes a
little<00:00:34.850> bit<00:00:35.000> too<00:00:35.120> much<00:00:35.270> about<00:00:35.510> the<00:00:35.660> screen<00:00:35.899> for

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
little bit too much about the screen for

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.590 
little bit too much about the screen for
me<00:00:36.230> and<00:00:36.410> i<00:00:36.469> just<00:00:36.649> am<00:00:36.800> not<00:00:36.950> used<00:00:36.980> to<00:00:37.219> it<00:00:37.600> that's

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
me and i just am not used to it that's

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.619 
me and i just am not used to it that's
with<00:00:38.750> h<00:00:38.930> you<00:00:39.140> can<00:00:39.260> do<00:00:39.380> that<00:00:39.559> and<00:00:39.800> they<00:00:40.219> added<00:00:40.460> a

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
with h you can do that and they added a

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:43.950 
with h you can do that and they added a
compass<00:00:41.629> to<00:00:41.660> it<00:00:41.870> now<00:00:41.989> so<00:00:42.260> it's<00:00:42.410> actually

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
compass to it now so it's actually

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.540 
compass to it now so it's actually
almost<00:00:44.960> cool<00:00:45.589> to<00:00:45.739> fly<00:00:45.890> like<00:00:46.039> that<00:00:46.100> because<00:00:46.370> now

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
almost cool to fly like that because now

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.979 
almost cool to fly like that because now
you<00:00:46.609> can<00:00:46.699> actually<00:00:46.940> use<00:00:47.239> your<00:00:47.449> cardinal

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
you can actually use your cardinal

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:49.900 
you can actually use your cardinal
directions<00:00:48.079> when<00:00:48.499> falling<00:00:48.710> with<00:00:48.859> others<00:00:49.070> but

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
directions when falling with others but

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.239 
directions when falling with others but
what<00:00:50.269> I'm<00:00:50.390> talking<00:00:50.809> about<00:00:50.870> is<00:00:51.199> um<00:00:51.469> scrolling

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:52.249 
what I'm talking about is um scrolling

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:53.680 
what I'm talking about is um scrolling
out<00:00:52.370> on<00:00:52.579> your<00:00:52.730> mini-map<00:00:52.909> which<00:00:53.210> is<00:00:53.449> the

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
out on your mini-map which is the

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.220 
out on your mini-map which is the
bracket<00:00:54.079> symbols<00:00:54.620> on<00:00:55.370> your<00:00:55.730> keyboard<00:00:56.230> I'm

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
bracket symbols on your keyboard I'm

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.509 
bracket symbols on your keyboard I'm
scrolling<00:00:57.499> in<00:00:57.800> and<00:00:57.980> scrolling<00:00:58.280> out<00:00:58.429> with

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
scrolling in and scrolling out with

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:01.149 
scrolling in and scrolling out with
bracket<00:00:58.940> now<00:00:59.600> when<00:00:59.870> flying<00:01:00.170> look<00:01:00.829> you<00:01:00.980> can<00:01:01.129> see

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:01.159 
bracket now when flying look you can see

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:03.939 
bracket now when flying look you can see
that<00:01:01.539> aircraft<00:01:02.539> coming<00:01:02.899> into<00:01:03.199> my<00:01:03.319> view<00:01:03.589> if<00:01:03.800> I

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
that aircraft coming into my view if I

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:05.710 
that aircraft coming into my view if I
was<00:01:04.129> flying<00:01:04.640> default<00:01:05.059> I<00:01:05.180> would<00:01:05.330> not<00:01:05.480> know<00:01:05.690> that

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
was flying default I would not know that

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.990 
was flying default I would not know that
that<00:01:06.020> friendly<00:01:06.440> is<00:01:06.500> coming<00:01:06.800> behind<00:01:06.920> me<00:01:07.130> but

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
that friendly is coming behind me but

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.370 
that friendly is coming behind me but
now<00:01:08.150> when<00:01:08.300> i<00:01:08.390> zoom<00:01:08.420> out<00:01:08.780> I<00:01:08.840> can<00:01:09.050> see<00:01:09.260> that

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
now when i zoom out I can see that

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.440 
now when i zoom out I can see that
there's<00:01:09.560> a<00:01:09.650> friendly<00:01:09.920> live<00:01:10.130> off<00:01:10.310> and<00:01:10.880> I<00:01:11.060> Massey

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
there's a friendly live off and I Massey

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.610 
there's a friendly live off and I Massey
coming<00:01:12.170> out<00:01:12.290> of<00:01:12.320> warp<00:01:12.410> gate

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:14.620 
coming out of warp gate

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.670 
coming out of warp gate
velocities<00:01:15.370> up<00:01:15.520> there<00:01:15.700> in<00:01:15.790> the<00:01:15.850> libs<00:01:16.060> up<00:01:16.240> high

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
velocities up there in the libs up high

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.340 
velocities up there in the libs up high
so<00:01:17.680> that's<00:01:17.920> just<00:01:18.010> a<00:01:18.370> quick<00:01:18.400> tip<00:01:19.390> and<00:01:19.690> I<00:01:19.930> always

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
so that's just a quick tip and I always

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.140 
so that's just a quick tip and I always
I<00:01:20.650> always<00:01:20.890> make<00:01:21.280> sure<00:01:21.310> that<00:01:21.520> i<00:01:21.670> zoom<00:01:21.970> all<00:01:22.120> the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
I always make sure that i zoom all the

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.970 
I always make sure that i zoom all the
way<00:01:22.270> out<00:01:22.360> when<00:01:22.600> I'm<00:01:22.720> flying<00:01:22.900> and<00:01:23.290> um<00:01:23.650> it's

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:23.980 
way out when I'm flying and um it's

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.330 
way out when I'm flying and um it's
significantly<00:01:24.760> bigger<00:01:25.360> I<00:01:25.720> mean<00:01:26.110> look<00:01:26.350> how

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
significantly bigger I mean look how

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.770 
significantly bigger I mean look how
much<00:01:27.520> more<00:01:27.730> you<00:01:27.760> can<00:01:27.970> see<00:01:28.210> you<00:01:28.390> can<00:01:28.510> see<00:01:28.750> that

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
much more you can see you can see that

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.480 
much more you can see you can see that
bridge<00:01:29.290> all<00:01:29.560> the<00:01:29.650> way<00:01:29.740> by<00:01:29.890> the<00:01:29.950> crown<00:01:32.460> quite<00:01:33.460> a

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
bridge all the way by the crown quite a

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.520 
bridge all the way by the crown quite a
big<00:01:33.730> difference<00:01:34.150> on<00:01:34.360> zune<00:01:34.810> levels<00:01:35.170> so<00:01:35.410> the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
big difference on zune levels so the

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.700 
big difference on zune levels so the
maximum<00:01:35.740> zoom<00:01:36.690> the<00:01:37.690> wide<00:01:37.870> assume<00:01:38.200> is<00:01:38.380> really

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
maximum zoom the wide assume is really

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.660 
maximum zoom the wide assume is really
helpful<00:01:38.950> for<00:01:39.250> flying<00:01:39.580> it<00:01:39.760> allows<00:01:40.030> you<00:01:40.240> to<00:01:41.670> keep

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
helpful for flying it allows you to keep

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.400 
helpful for flying it allows you to keep
track<00:01:42.730> of<00:01:42.970> targets<00:01:43.450> and<00:01:43.630> stuff<00:01:43.870> a<00:01:44.050> lot<00:01:44.170> easier

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
track of targets and stuff a lot easier

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:56.710 
track of targets and stuff a lot easier
and<00:01:44.800> this<00:01:45.790> site

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.020 

just<00:01:57.350> got<00:01:57.530> on<00:01:57.560> I'm<00:01:57.830> not<00:01:57.980> really<00:01:58.220> warmed<00:01:58.520> up<00:01:58.670> mr.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
just got on I'm not really warmed up mr.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:15.740 
just got on I'm not really warmed up mr.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
there's a live up here too i think so

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.290 
there's a live up here too i think so
both<00:02:19.440> friendly
