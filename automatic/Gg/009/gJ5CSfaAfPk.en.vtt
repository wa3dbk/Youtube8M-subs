and that's what we want to look at today

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.100 
and that's what we want to look at today
so<00:01:19.430> we<00:01:19.909> want<00:01:20.150> to<00:01:20.270> talk<00:01:20.420> a<00:01:20.479> little<00:01:20.570> bit<00:01:20.780> more

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
so we want to talk a little bit more

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.410 
so we want to talk a little bit more
about<00:01:21.320> differences<00:01:22.070> between<00:01:22.250> credit<00:01:22.880> unions

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
institutions and out of that

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.680 
institutions and out of that
conversation<00:01:27.610> we'll<00:01:28.610> get<00:01:28.760> a<00:01:28.790> better<00:01:29.030> sense<00:01:29.360> of

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
conversation we'll get a better sense of

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.200 
conversation we'll get a better sense of
you<00:01:30.470> know<00:01:30.500> why<00:01:31.130> that<00:01:31.550> credit<00:01:31.880> union<00:01:32.090> can

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
you know why that credit union can

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.690 
you know why that credit union can
provide<00:01:32.450> some<00:01:32.750> better<00:01:33.229> terms<00:01:33.620> and<00:01:34.280> what<00:01:34.490> some

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
provide some better terms and what some

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.300 
provide some better terms and what some
of<00:01:34.760> those<00:01:34.850> terms<00:01:35.090> are<00:01:35.450> so<00:01:35.840> Victoria<00:01:36.440> first<00:01:37.010> of

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
of those terms are so Victoria first of

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.480 
of those terms are so Victoria first of
all<00:01:37.690> the<00:01:38.690> most<00:01:38.930> meaningful<00:01:39.409> difference<00:01:40.040> is<00:01:40.250> is

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
all the most meaningful difference is is

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.520 
all the most meaningful difference is is
that<00:01:40.940> our<00:01:40.970> credit<00:01:41.540> union<00:01:41.570> is<00:01:42.049> the<00:01:42.170> member

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
that our credit union is the member

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.310 
that our credit union is the member
owned<00:01:42.890> that<00:01:43.610> would<00:01:43.790> be<00:01:43.940> versus<00:01:44.420> a<00:01:44.450> corporation

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
owned that would be versus a corporation

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.960 
owned that would be versus a corporation
that<00:01:45.350> would<00:01:45.680> be<00:01:45.799> owned<00:01:45.950> by<00:01:46.070> its<00:01:46.190> shareholders

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
that would be owned by its shareholders

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.240 
that would be owned by its shareholders
or<00:01:47.240> stockholders<00:01:47.350> that<00:01:48.350> they<00:01:48.500> pay<00:01:48.710> dividends

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
or stockholders that they pay dividends

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.410 
or stockholders that they pay dividends
to<00:01:49.280> so<00:01:50.150> when<00:01:50.299> you<00:01:50.510> say<00:01:50.720> member<00:01:51.290> owned

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
to so when you say member owned

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.420 
to so when you say member owned
not-for-profit<00:01:53.420> cooperative<00:01:54.229> each<00:01:54.799> word<00:01:55.220> is

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
not-for-profit cooperative each word is

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.590 
not-for-profit cooperative each word is
so<00:01:55.670> meaningful<00:01:56.090> into<00:01:56.630> what<00:01:56.810> that<00:01:56.990> means<00:01:57.200> to<00:01:57.409> us

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
so meaningful into what that means to us

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.850 
so meaningful into what that means to us
not-for-profit<00:01:59.600> in<00:01:59.810> the<00:01:59.990> sense<00:02:00.260> that<00:02:00.409> all<00:02:00.799> of

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
not-for-profit in the sense that all of

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.250 
not-for-profit in the sense that all of
our<00:02:01.310> earnings<00:02:01.780> that<00:02:02.780> if<00:02:02.960> you<00:02:03.110> were<00:02:03.229> a

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
corporation would be paid to

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.420 
corporation would be paid to
shareholders<00:02:05.140> those<00:02:06.140> earnings<00:02:06.799> are<00:02:06.950> actually

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
shareholders those earnings are actually

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.149 
shareholders those earnings are actually
paid<00:02:07.760> back<00:02:08.030> in<00:02:08.330> the<00:02:08.450> form<00:02:08.750> of<00:02:09.080> one<00:02:09.799> would<00:02:10.009> be

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:10.159 
paid back in the form of one would be

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:13.170 
paid back in the form of one would be
higher<00:02:10.819> yields<00:02:11.750> on<00:02:11.870> your<00:02:12.019> savings<00:02:12.409> products

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
higher yields on your savings products

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.350 
higher yields on your savings products
lower<00:02:14.180> and<00:02:14.569> more<00:02:14.720> favorable<00:02:15.260> loan<00:02:15.439> terms<00:02:15.769> and

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
lower and more favorable loan terms and

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.850 
lower and more favorable loan terms and
literally<00:02:17.360> little<00:02:17.750> to<00:02:18.049> no<00:02:18.230> fees<00:02:18.530> of

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
literally little to no fees of

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.520 
literally little to no fees of
transaction<00:02:19.610> costs<00:02:20.000> so<00:02:20.540> it<00:02:20.659> sounds<00:02:20.989> like<00:02:21.080> the

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
transaction costs so it sounds like the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.869 
transaction costs so it sounds like the
credit<00:02:21.860> union<00:02:22.099> can<00:02:22.220> offer<00:02:22.400> you<00:02:22.760> know<00:02:22.849> a

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
credit union can offer you know a

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:24.429 
credit union can offer you know a
