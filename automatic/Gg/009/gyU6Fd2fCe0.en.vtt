00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 hello friends how are you in this video 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.730
 we are going to install windows 8.1 in a 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.809
 computer as a previous step we need 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:16.230
 an iso in a cd or in a pendrive of 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:19.560
 windows 8.1 we can get it in the 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.590
 microsoft page after buying 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.289
 our license remind you that 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:30.179
 there are two types of licenses is the 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:33.239
 license pro and windows 8.1 normal when 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:37.020
 let's put our installation DVD or a 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.840
 pendrive we will get this screen that is 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.450
 the loading start screen and 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.820
 below we will see status here 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.720
 we choose the language we want and we 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.720
 we give to next 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:54.430
 Now here we choose install now you 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.770
 we leave a moment that loads now we 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.010
 ask for an installation key no 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.840
 confuse with the activation key that 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.640
 we will be asked later later inside 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.379
 of the system this is a key to 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.130
 installation that depends on which 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:12.640
 let's say it will be installed windows 8.1 normal 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:15.160
 or windows 8.1 pro depending on the serial 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.100
 that we put this serial we 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:21.009
 will make it easier for microsoft when we buy 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:25.180
 our license once the 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:28.330
 Windows 8.1 or Windows 8.1 license 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.820
 but we give the next one and it appears 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.670
 the license agreement it 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.860
 we accept and we give the next one now 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.660
 we choose if we want to update from a 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.430
 windows that we had previously 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.770
 installed 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.560
 or personalized to me I like to choose 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.490
 personalized because this option of 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.530
 update sometimes causes problems 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.540
 so personalized makes a 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.030
 clean installation and in my opinion more 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.220
 effective here we see a list of the 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.310
 discs that we have in our computer 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:03.460
 in my case I only have one and it's empty 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:07.840
 that's why he puts unassigned spaces in the 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:11.470
 drive 0 windows 8.1 in the pro version 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.560
 you need an additional partition of 300 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.540
 megas but it does it automatically 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.790
 when we assign a partition where 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.280
 installed automatically and in a way 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.850
 transparent to us will create another 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.460
 partition 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.430
 so we can give it to new or 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:31.310
 directly to the next 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.530
 this is the longest process so what 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.420
 I'm going to cut and we'll be right back there 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:40.900
 we see how it is ending 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.239
 and it will restart in 10 seconds if 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.030
 appears that we press a key to 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.880
 enter the disk 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.740
 this time we do not press it since 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.130
 has to enter the hard drive in the 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:57.170
 installation disk now after a 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.170
 installation time will make a reboot 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.740
 and we see that this menu appears 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:09.120
 welcome configuration let's say 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:11.730
 and we have to put a name of the pc 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.489
 choose a color 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.310
 and this is a series of options that 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.310
 we have to choose I will give to use 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:23.879
 the quick configuration but you 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:26.720
 you can read the settings carefully if 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.720
 Jce wants it 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.550
 now it is highly recommended that 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:35.030
 let's introduce a life account of 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:37.700
 outlook hotmail in short an account 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.380
 from microsoft to associate with our 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:43.020
 windows 8.1 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.960
 and well, they're going to send me a message 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.370
 phone 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.370
 for security reasons 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:55.500
 it's an extra security measure 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:58.280
 what's in windows 8.1 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.810
 to be able to synchronize the information 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:04.140
 that we had in our old 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.450
 computer if we do not put the code alone 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.010
 we can choose a configuration as a 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.920
 new equipment 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.659
 I'm going to choose this option because in 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:17.390
 this case I do not want to synchronize with 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:17.390
 the last one and I give it to next 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:23.390
 these are skydrive options that like 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.530
 you know is a kind of hard drive in 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.139
 Cloud 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.330
 I give in my case to the next 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:34.129
 and here we see a small video 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:36.740
 introductory windows 8.1 while it 

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:38.720
 finish installing the system 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:42.100
 and well I'm going to accelerate a bit because 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:46.180
 It usually takes a long time 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:48.880
 and we can use our windows 8.1 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:52.030
 As you can see, it's very easy to install it 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.310
 I hope you find the video useful and 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:58.290
 see you actually alternate point is 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.290
 greetings friends to another
