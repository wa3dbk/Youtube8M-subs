review of the official Apple battery
charger<00:00:16.250> now<00:00:17.250> it<00:00:17.490> was<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.670> big<00:00:18.029> shock<00:00:18.359> when

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
charger now it was a big shock when

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.420 
charger now it was a big shock when
Apple<00:00:19.020> released<00:00:19.320> this<00:00:19.439> product<00:00:19.920> but<00:00:20.189> when<00:00:20.400> you

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
Apple released this product but when you

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.910 
Apple released this product but when you
think<00:00:20.820> about<00:00:20.910> it<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:21.630> makes<00:00:21.869> sense<00:00:22.050> because

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
think about it it makes sense because

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.830 
think about it it makes sense because
the<00:00:23.279> charger<00:00:23.640> comes<00:00:23.880> with<00:00:24.060> 6<00:00:24.390> double-a

so<00:00:33.030> here<00:00:33.300> we<00:00:33.420> have<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.780> box<00:00:33.989> itself<00:00:34.410> as<00:00:34.649> you

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
so here we have the box itself as you

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.190 
so here we have the box itself as you
can<00:00:34.950> see<00:00:35.070> it's<00:00:35.190> very<00:00:35.309> simple<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.780> obviously

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
can see it's very simple and obviously

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.799 
can see it's very simple and obviously
this<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.469> typical<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.219> Apple<00:00:38.670> packaging<00:00:39.180> on

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
this is typical of Apple packaging on

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.690 
this is typical of Apple packaging on
the<00:00:40.110> front<00:00:40.350> we<00:00:40.469> have<00:00:40.649> an<00:00:40.770> image<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.219> the

the front we have an image of the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.760 
the front we have an image of the
battery<00:00:42.390> charger<00:00:42.780> with<00:00:42.899> two<00:00:43.200> batteries

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
battery charger with two batteries

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.580 
battery charger with two batteries
inside<00:00:44.100> at<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.180> top<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.750> just<00:00:45.809> says<00:00:46.170> battery

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
inside at the top it just says battery

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.430 
inside at the top it just says battery
charger<00:00:46.980> on<00:00:47.329> the<00:00:48.329> right<00:00:48.510> we<00:00:48.930> just<00:00:49.140> have<00:00:49.260> some

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
charger on the right we just have some

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.470 
charger on the right we just have some
information<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.700> tells<00:00:50.910> us<00:00:51.090> what<00:00:51.270> comes

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
information and it tells us what comes

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.290 
information and it tells us what comes
in<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.660> box<00:00:51.960> on<00:00:52.370> the<00:00:53.370> Left<00:00:53.579> we<00:00:53.730> have<00:00:53.789> an<00:00:54.000> Apple

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
in the box on the Left we have an Apple

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.779 
in the box on the Left we have an Apple
logo<00:00:54.390> on<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.559> back<00:00:55.770> we<00:00:56.010> have<00:00:56.160> another<00:00:56.430> image

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
logo on the back we have another image

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.240 
logo on the back we have another image
of<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.149> battery<00:00:57.480> charger<00:00:57.870> on<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.770> bottom<00:00:59.129> we

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
of the battery charger on the bottom we

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.740 
of the battery charger on the bottom we
just<00:00:59.430> have<00:00:59.579> some<00:00:59.820> product<00:01:00.449> information

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
just have some product information

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.860 
just have some product information
including<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.829> serial<00:01:02.340> codes<00:01:02.579> so<00:01:03.480> let's<00:01:03.660> go

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
including the serial codes so let's go

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:12.450 
including the serial codes so let's go
ahead<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.350> open<00:01:04.860> up<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.250> box

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.910 

so<00:01:13.460> inside<00:01:16.120> we<00:01:17.120> obviously<00:01:17.960> have<00:01:18.350> access<00:01:18.770> to

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
so inside we obviously have access to

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.280 
so inside we obviously have access to
the<00:01:19.040> do<00:01:19.190> batteries<00:01:19.670> but<00:01:19.970> we<00:01:20.600> just<00:01:20.780> open<00:01:21.110> it<00:01:21.170> up

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
the do batteries but we just open it up

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.960 
the do batteries but we just open it up
once<00:01:21.890> ma<00:01:22.360> we<00:01:23.360> have<00:01:23.570> the<00:01:23.780> three<00:01:24.290> pin<00:01:24.530> UK<00:01:25.010> adapter

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
once ma we have the three pin UK adapter

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.410 
once ma we have the three pin UK adapter
which<00:01:26.480> slots<00:01:26.810> into<00:01:27.050> the<00:01:27.230> charger<00:01:27.530> itself<00:01:27.680> and

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
which slots into the charger itself and

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.480 
which slots into the charger itself and
if<00:01:29.420> we<00:01:29.600> just<00:01:29.750> pull<00:01:30.020> it<00:01:30.710> through<00:01:30.980> we<00:01:31.190> have<00:01:31.340> the

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
if we just pull it through we have the

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.150 
if we just pull it through we have the
charger<00:01:31.940> itself<00:01:32.060> and<00:01:32.860> all<00:01:33.860> we<00:01:34.100> do<00:01:34.310> is<00:01:34.610> mount

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
charger itself and all we do is mount

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.110 
charger itself and all we do is mount
this<00:01:37.270> onto<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:38.690> charger<00:01:39.470> agency<00:01:40.190> and<00:01:41.000> we

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
this onto the charger agency and we

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.290 
this onto the charger agency and we
already<00:01:41.270> have<00:01:41.660> two<00:01:41.960> nickel<00:01:42.470> metal<00:01:42.710> hydride

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
already have two nickel metal hydride

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.440 
already have two nickel metal hydride
batteries<00:01:44.300> installed<00:01:45.880> just<00:01:46.880> open<00:01:47.240> up<00:01:47.330> the

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
batteries installed just open up the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:57.420 
batteries installed just open up the
bottom<00:01:54.430> we<00:01:55.430> have<00:01:55.460> another<00:01:56.210> two<00:01:56.810> pairs<00:01:57.080> of

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
bottom we have another two pairs of

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.859 
bottom we have another two pairs of
these<00:01:58.430> special<00:01:59.030> nickel<00:01:59.479> metal<00:01:59.660> hydride

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
these special nickel metal hydride

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.180 
these special nickel metal hydride
batteries<00:02:01.420> also<00:02:02.420> in<00:02:02.540> the<00:02:02.630> box<00:02:02.840> we<00:02:03.619> have<00:02:03.650> the

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
batteries also in the box we have the

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.850 
batteries also in the box we have the
standard<00:02:04.880> Apple<00:02:05.390> documentation<00:02:06.229> including<00:02:06.770> a

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
standard Apple documentation including a

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:13.150 
standard Apple documentation including a
user<00:02:07.100> guide<00:02:07.400> and<00:02:09.310> we<00:02:10.310> also<00:02:10.429> have<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:12.290> warranty

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
user guide and we also have the warranty

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.790 
user guide and we also have the warranty
but<00:02:13.459> it<00:02:14.209> doesn't<00:02:14.630> appear<00:02:14.930> as<00:02:15.080> though<00:02:15.320> there

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
but it doesn't appear as though there

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.610 
but it doesn't appear as though there
are<00:02:15.980> any<00:02:16.280> Apple<00:02:17.060> stickers<00:02:17.269> which<00:02:17.660> is<00:02:17.870> a<00:02:18.080> bit

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
are any Apple stickers which is a bit

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.820 
are any Apple stickers which is a bit
disappointing<00:02:19.810> so<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:21.200> special<00:02:21.440> thing<00:02:21.800> about

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
disappointing so the special thing about

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.910 
disappointing so the special thing about
these<00:02:22.280> batteries<00:02:22.820> is<00:02:23.090> that<00:02:23.300> they<00:02:23.930> are<00:02:24.320> nickel

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
these batteries is that they are nickel

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.490 
these batteries is that they are nickel
metal<00:02:25.250> hydride<00:02:25.459> batteries<00:02:26.330> and<00:02:26.930> this<00:02:27.110> makes

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
metal hydride batteries and this makes

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.470 
metal hydride batteries and this makes
them<00:02:27.739> more<00:02:27.980> efficient<00:02:28.550> and<00:02:28.760> gives<00:02:29.239> them<00:02:29.390> a

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
them more efficient and gives them a

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.170 
them more efficient and gives them a
longer<00:02:29.720> lifespan<00:02:30.050> and<00:02:30.590> Apple<00:02:31.400> actually<00:02:31.940> claim

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
longer lifespan and Apple actually claim

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.660 
longer lifespan and Apple actually claim
that<00:02:32.420> they<00:02:32.630> last<00:02:32.930> 10<00:02:33.320> years<00:02:33.590> so<00:02:33.890> it<00:02:33.920> will<00:02:34.550> be

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
that they last 10 years so it will be

thoughts<00:05:34.140> well<00:05:34.680> over<00:05:35.100> the<00:05:35.220> years<00:05:35.430> when<00:05:35.820> Apple

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
thoughts well over the years when Apple

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.510 
thoughts well over the years when Apple
has<00:05:36.300> entered<00:05:36.720> a<00:05:36.780> market<00:05:37.170> they<00:05:37.680> usually<00:05:37.980> end<00:05:38.400> up

dominating it take the Apple iPod for

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
example and I think that this device

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.540 
example and I think that this device
will<00:05:46.440> do<00:05:46.590> the<00:05:46.740> same<00:05:46.950> thing<00:05:47.250> for<00:05:47.460> the

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
will do the same thing for the

will do the same thing for the
