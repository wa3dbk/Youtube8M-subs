00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:26.760 

because<00:01:14.899> I<00:01:15.049> use<00:01:15.229> them<00:01:15.439> for<00:01:15.499> rubber<00:01:16.249> stamping

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:37.629 

the<00:01:27.770> nice<00:01:27.950> thing<00:01:28.219> is<00:01:28.369> that<00:01:28.490> this<00:01:29.409> clips<00:01:36.639> which

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
means of this side it's always going to

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.980 
means of this side it's always going to
be<00:01:39.229> on<00:01:39.409> the<00:01:39.499> bottom<00:01:41.979> right<00:01:42.979> so<00:01:43.729> this<00:01:44.719> is<00:01:44.780> the

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
be on the bottom right so this is the

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.719 
be on the bottom right so this is the
first<00:01:45.170> one<00:01:47.409> and<00:01:48.409> what<00:01:48.979> I've<00:01:49.130> done<00:01:49.310> is<00:01:49.369> I've<00:01:49.700> put

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
first one and what I've done is I've put

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.629 
first one and what I've done is I've put
in<00:01:50.359> my<00:01:51.459> Korean<00:01:52.459> diary<00:01:53.179> stickers<00:01:53.719> they<00:01:53.899> came

00:01:54.639 --> 00:02:01.769 
in my Korean diary stickers they came
it's<00:01:55.639> not<00:01:55.819> sticker<00:01:56.119> stamps<00:01:58.179> boxes<00:01:59.179> like<00:01:59.929> this

00:02:01.769 --> 00:02:01.779 
it's not sticker stamps boxes like this

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:05.679 
it's not sticker stamps boxes like this
but<00:02:03.189> it's<00:02:04.189> just<00:02:04.369> much<00:02:04.670> much<00:02:04.880> easier<00:02:05.329> for<00:02:05.509> me<00:02:05.569> to

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
but it's just much much easier for me to

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:12.490 
but it's just much much easier for me to
store<00:02:06.079> them<00:02:06.229> all<00:02:06.380> in<00:02:06.649> one<00:02:06.709> place<00:02:10.750> too<00:02:11.750> much<00:02:11.780> and

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
store them all in one place too much and

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.039 
store them all in one place too much and
