Caesar was a great Pokemon of which I

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.480

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.230 
he was harder to use in the second
generation<00:01:25.290> because<00:01:25.979> just<00:01:26.250> plain<00:01:26.580> wasn't<00:01:27.060> any

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
the diamond diamond and pearl but it was

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.409 
the diamond diamond and pearl but it was
a<00:03:55.989> fun<00:03:56.199> game<00:03:56.229> I<00:03:56.709> think<00:03:57.400> it's<00:03:57.489> like<00:03:57.609> I've<00:03:58.209> seen

a fun game I think it's like I've seen

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:00.599 
a fun game I think it's like I've seen
it<00:03:58.510> was<00:03:58.659> 40<00:03:59.049> bucks<00:03:59.290> in<00:03:59.470> some<00:03:59.680> places<00:03:59.949> but<00:04:00.400> I

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
it was 40 bucks in some places but I

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:02.280 
it was 40 bucks in some places but I
didn't<00:04:01.120> pay<00:04:01.239> for<00:04:01.269> it<00:04:01.569> actually<00:04:01.840> got<00:04:01.989> it<00:04:02.169> for

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290
