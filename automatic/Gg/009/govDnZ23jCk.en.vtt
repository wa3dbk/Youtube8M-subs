we<00:01:18.110> turn<00:01:18.320> these<00:01:18.500> into<00:01:19.060> Goodman<00:01:20.060> revisable<00:01:20.509> rib

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
we turn these into Goodman revisable rib

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.950 
we turn these into Goodman revisable rib
rolls<00:01:21.140> so<00:01:22.040> we<00:01:22.130> cut<00:01:22.310> the<00:01:22.630> we'll<00:01:23.630> trim<00:01:23.840> it<00:01:23.930> down

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
rolls so we cut the we'll trim it down

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.190

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
rolls and with the remaining rips we

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.279 
rolls and with the remaining rips we
then<00:01:30.800> trim<00:01:31.130> in<00:01:31.310> between<00:01:31.640> each<00:01:32.330> rib<00:01:32.869> taking

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
then trim in between each rib taking

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:35.469 
then trim in between each rib taking
away<00:01:33.380> the<00:01:33.530> sinew<00:01:33.890> clean<00:01:34.369> each<00:01:34.550> bone<00:01:34.820> up<00:01:35.000> and

away the sinew clean each bone up and
then<00:01:36.229> what<00:01:36.410> we'll<00:01:36.560> do<00:01:36.710> we<00:01:36.860> will<00:01:36.950> cut<00:01:37.130> them<00:01:37.280> we

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
then what we'll do we will cut them we

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.910 
then what we'll do we will cut them we
wrap<00:01:38.450> them<00:01:38.600> in<00:01:38.690> tinfoil<00:01:39.110> a<00:01:39.410> little<00:01:39.740> bit<00:01:39.830> of

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
wrap them in tinfoil a little bit of

butter some apple juice and some honey

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:44.889 
butter some apple juice and some honey
and<00:01:41.720> then<00:01:42.440> we<00:01:42.500> braise<00:01:42.740> them<00:01:42.920> in<00:01:43.039> the<00:01:43.130> oven<00:01:43.899> 350

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
and then we braise them in the oven 350

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:46.960 
and then we braise them in the oven 350
degrees<00:01:45.110> for<00:01:45.380> about<00:01:46.310> two<00:01:46.610> to<00:01:46.759> three<00:01:46.789> hours

degrees for about two to three hours

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.760 
degrees for about two to three hours
till<00:01:47.330> they<00:01:47.420> go<00:01:47.509> soft<00:01:47.780> and<00:01:47.960> tender<00:01:48.080> then<00:01:48.679> we

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
till they go soft and tender then we

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.130 
till they go soft and tender then we
take<00:01:48.950> them<00:01:49.160> out<00:01:49.250> and<00:01:49.550> using<00:01:50.360> the<00:01:50.450> charcoal

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
take them out and using the charcoal

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.680 
take them out and using the charcoal
barbecues<00:01:51.619> that<00:01:51.649> we<00:01:51.860> cook<00:01:52.580> off<00:01:52.729> we<00:01:53.479> get<00:01:53.600> the

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690
