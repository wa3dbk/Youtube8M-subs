upstairs and a downstairs in a way just

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:20.140 
upstairs and a downstairs in a way just
a<00:03:19.159> little<00:03:19.370> bit<00:03:19.489> different<00:03:19.909> than<00:03:20.030> your

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
a little bit different than your

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.089 
a little bit different than your
standard<00:03:20.359> pac-man<00:03:20.989> made<00:03:21.230> especially<00:03:21.500> with

standard pac-man made especially with
the<00:03:22.419> the<00:03:23.419> jumps<00:03:23.889> it's<00:03:24.889> a<00:03:24.950> nice<00:03:25.129> way<00:03:25.340> to<00:03:25.370> get

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
the the jumps it's a nice way to get

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:26.770 
the the jumps it's a nice way to get
away<00:03:25.669> from<00:03:25.790> the<00:03:25.969> ghosts<00:03:26.299> other<00:03:26.419> than<00:03:26.629> just

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
away from the ghosts other than just

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.069 
away from the ghosts other than just
using<00:03:26.900> the<00:03:27.049> side<00:03:27.319> spots<00:03:28.569> no<00:03:29.569> if<00:03:29.659> once<00:03:29.870> coming

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
using the side spots no if once coming

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:31.330 
using the side spots no if once coming
in<00:03:30.290> here<00:03:30.439> you<00:03:30.500> can<00:03:30.650> just<00:03:30.739> hurry<00:03:30.919> up<00:03:31.010> and<00:03:31.219> hop

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
in here you can just hurry up and hop

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:38.220 
in here you can just hurry up and hop
out<00:03:31.519> of<00:03:31.579> the<00:03:31.700> way<00:03:31.879> it's<00:03:32.659> not<00:03:32.810> a<00:03:32.840> big<00:03:33.049> deal

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.030 

that's<00:03:39.310> obviously<00:03:40.310> not<00:03:40.579> how<00:03:40.760> to<00:03:40.879> do<00:03:41.000> it<00:03:42.040> you

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
that's obviously not how to do it you

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.229 
that's obviously not how to do it you
get<00:03:43.129> that<00:03:43.310> pill<00:03:43.519> in<00:03:43.669> the<00:03:43.729> middle<00:03:43.940> that<00:03:44.000> I<00:03:44.090> just

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
get that pill in the middle that I just

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.930 
get that pill in the middle that I just
landed<00:03:44.659> on<00:03:44.720> by<00:03:44.930> spawning<00:03:45.409> and<00:03:46.340> not<00:03:46.519> all<00:03:46.790> the

goes into that basket for a short period

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.759 
goes into that basket for a short period
of<00:03:48.949> time<00:03:49.690> it's<00:03:50.690> pretty<00:03:50.810> helpful<00:03:51.139> too<00:03:51.470> like

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
of time it's pretty helpful too like

there's<00:03:52.040> a<00:03:52.099> few<00:03:52.280> different<00:03:52.489> power-ups<00:03:52.729> a

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:52.879 
there's a few different power-ups a

boots<00:04:56.419> or<00:04:56.539> not<00:04:56.689> I<00:04:56.719> thought<00:04:56.990> they<00:04:57.169> were<00:04:59.800> so<00:05:00.800> you

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
boots or not I thought they were so you

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.110 
boots or not I thought they were so you
just<00:05:00.979> work<00:05:01.099> your<00:05:01.250> way<00:05:01.340> through<00:05:01.370> level<00:05:01.879> 4<00:05:02.000> level

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
just work your way through level 4 level

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.059 
just work your way through level 4 level
and<00:05:02.509> like<00:05:02.629> pac-man<00:05:02.930> they<00:05:03.379> did<00:05:03.590> add<00:05:03.830> an

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:04.069 
and like pac-man they did add an

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:09.700 
and like pac-man they did add an
embossed<00:05:04.639> to<00:05:04.849> this<00:05:04.969> game<00:05:07.960> also<00:05:08.960> worth<00:05:09.409> a<00:05:09.560> ton

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
embossed to this game also worth a ton

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:20.950 
embossed to this game also worth a ton
of<00:05:09.770> points<00:05:10.340> and<00:05:11.800> pretty<00:05:12.800> difficult<00:05:12.979> also<00:05:19.960> like

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
of points and pretty difficult also like

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.290 
of points and pretty difficult also like
I<00:05:21.050> said<00:05:21.080> if<00:05:21.460> you<00:05:22.460> bring<00:05:22.580> it<00:05:22.729> another<00:05:22.909> player<00:05:23.150> if

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
I said if you bring it another player if

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.339 
I said if you bring it another player if
you're<00:05:23.389> playing<00:05:23.569> a<00:05:23.629> two-player<00:05:23.990> you<00:05:24.110> can<00:05:24.229> kind

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:24.349 
you're playing a two-player you can kind

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:27.189 
you're playing a two-player you can kind
of<00:05:24.409> mess<00:05:24.529> with<00:05:24.770> each<00:05:24.800> other<00:05:25.900> pump<00:05:26.900> each<00:05:27.020> other

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199 
of mess with each other pump each other

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:29.999 
of mess with each other pump each other
up<00:05:27.440> I<00:05:27.710> think<00:05:27.979> it's<00:05:28.129> worth<00:05:28.279> like<00:05:28.460> 10,000<00:05:29.000> points

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:30.009 
up I think it's worth like 10,000 points

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:35.649 
up I think it's worth like 10,000 points
so<00:05:33.699> they<00:05:34.699> have<00:05:34.879> the<00:05:35.029> chance<00:05:35.240> to<00:05:35.330> tap<00:05:35.509> the

00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:35.659 
so they have the chance to tap the

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:37.089 
so they have the chance to tap the
button<00:05:35.779> as<00:05:35.990> fast<00:05:36.199> as<00:05:36.379> possible<00:05:36.830> and<00:05:36.860> they<00:05:36.979> can

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:37.099 
button as fast as possible and they can

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:41.170 
button as fast as possible and they can
get<00:05:37.190> out<00:05:37.250> of<00:05:37.370> it<00:05:37.550> but<00:05:37.990> yeah<00:05:39.699> ton<00:05:40.699> of<00:05:40.729> points<00:05:41.060> if

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
get out of it but yeah ton of points if

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.540 
get out of it but yeah ton of points if
you<00:05:41.270> end<00:05:41.449> up<00:05:41.509> hitting<00:05:41.690> them<00:05:42.250> definitely<00:05:43.250> fun

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
you end up hitting them definitely fun

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:44.379 
you end up hitting them definitely fun
to<00:05:43.580> mess<00:05:43.789> with<00:05:43.909> each<00:05:44.060> other<00:05:44.240> if<00:05:44.330> you're

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:44.389 
to mess with each other if you're

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:46.379 
to mess with each other if you're
playing<00:05:44.569> with<00:05:44.659> a<00:05:44.779> buddy

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:46.389 
playing with a buddy

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:51.909 
playing with a buddy
but<00:05:47.389> that's<00:05:47.930> dick<00:05:48.770> Belger<00:05:49.099> in<00:05:49.370> the<00:05:49.520> book

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:55.999 

and<00:05:52.919> last<00:05:53.520> but<00:05:53.699> not<00:05:53.970> least<00:05:54.360> we've<00:05:54.960> got<00:05:55.020> rally-x

00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:56.009 
and last but not least we've got rally-x

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:00.920 
and last but not least we've got rally-x
I<00:05:58.759> guess<00:05:59.759> it<00:05:59.909> is<00:06:00.000> one<00:06:00.150> player<00:06:00.360> only<00:06:00.569> on<00:06:00.810> the

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
I guess it is one player only on the

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.550 
I guess it is one player only on the
arrangement<00:06:01.500> you<00:06:01.710> can't<00:06:01.860> even<00:06:02.039> alternate<00:06:02.490> but

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:03.560 
arrangement you can't even alternate but

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.170 
arrangement you can't even alternate but
still<00:06:04.560> rally<00:06:04.800> exit<00:06:05.250> hard<00:06:05.460> they<00:06:05.819> added<00:06:06.060> some

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
still rally exit hard they added some

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.820 
still rally exit hard they added some
power-ups<00:06:06.569> much<00:06:06.780> like<00:06:06.990> Dig<00:06:07.199> Dug<00:06:07.229> didn't

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
power-ups much like Dig Dug didn't

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.790

change a whole lot you get a random item
