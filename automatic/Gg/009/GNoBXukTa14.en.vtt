00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:03.859
 roj 

00:00:08.229 --> 00:00:11.229
 a 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.109
 last year earlier since the end of September the specially equipped system 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:25.810
 If you want to respond to the articles 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.739
 well a lot 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:30.739
 as the ones when they laid in those are still there 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:33.700
 so that is so will be remarkable 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.630
 that is the fact that this is that the turf is a good we are a lot of grass 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:39.640
 on 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.350
 it is 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.350
 club good to shorten to play football 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.510
 I think that is also very important for Ajax for us players and 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.940
 perhaps that is not just a good one 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.019
 a good round the ground you want the ball a little easier to play towards each other 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.340
 because the lesser fall manifesto are places where assumptions are made and that must go in 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.910
 basically it 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.820
 helping the attacking game after, so I think it is very important 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.540
 the fact that between that is good 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.320
 sell the club and the players 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.810
 Well the players always criticize it but also overall if you do it 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.440
 compare seventh years ago then I think we should already be very satisfied 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.260
 to be 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.570
 because grass is mat now according to me 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.830
 In January, the best turf in the Netherlands is currently the club 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.580
 However, it just has the fact that you just 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.680
 the possibilities for the Netherlands 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.740
 you can do it 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.740
 the water has to open or close part of the roof 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:58.470
 in an explanation 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:59.860
 it is a 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.430
 the light you need to grow gas 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.510
 that would be you with the wind 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.690
 the state channel I believe the basic elements needed to be guests 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.689
 to grow the temperatures 

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:14.370
 that has the problems of clearing up winter land 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:20.449
 the largest island according to meijer wellink has got what about 2 

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:21.669
 green 

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:24.589
 prior to placing a walk 

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:27.789
 the stentor the one who does not have daylight 

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:30.809
 well, that was a discussion for ten years 

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:32.549
 whether or not lamps 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.239
 I have it that says good has gone so far is common 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.379
 not acceptable for ajax you can't just go grass 

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:42.129
 to the players 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:45.129
 we get it from the hospital 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:47.979
 I 

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:49.979
 had gone 

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:53.009
 I had a week to perform as well as possible and you do everything together 

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:56.319
 then you could hit on to play so 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.879
 that is not the intention then it is there so we can only take it too 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:04.109
 many with its general direction you must already have contacted the reinunie 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:09.829
 lived the year after most i am aware i think it was before 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:12.869
 play is important to play nice and bright if you have a submenu 

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:17.719
 get the stadium with a lot of attention and do you feel like playing football when you 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:18.789
 feeling 

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:21.789
 sit on a good grass mat that encourages new purchases and 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.599
 So that's important for footballers after 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:31.139
 Of course I realize that I also have regular contact with the people who 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.429
 field practitioners 

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:38.349
 also the training field and after running well we have said a number of times 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.909
 what else does it get better fate or not running there we have 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:43.449
 listened to so well 

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:46.989
 They also have their input and then we know how to buy their things through 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:47.689
 plus 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:49.979
 yes I think that is 

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:52.099
 in the aex were among others 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.859
 the large market 4 was again shot at by the improvements 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:58.199
 piet puk to do a perk 

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:59.329
 better bed 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:02.059
 I don't think it's you 

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:06.389
 Late as far as I can remember was indeed good for you as an immigrant 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:09.389
 turf 9 

00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:13.919
 I know how much an equal can measure and but it is true that 

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:18.499
 I think we will be in the Meern in January 

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:22.519
 one is getting a good turf all we have now in the arena in January 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:27.860
 and we look no matter how far we have a good turf in my previous vote in May 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.770
 wanted to wait 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.590
 but well those circumstances because it is not comparable 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.259
 the merelstraat 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:37.259
 he states that there was a lot of sun for a long time 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:41.879
 water and air came to look at so yes that was actually what we normally do 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:43.349
 spoken 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:46.240
 were used to 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.240
 Rob van Grinsven 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.039
 that is lying 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:54.860
 there is another piece of that criticism 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.710
 Sure the channel is nothing nice a football player 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.080
 and completely identical sheets 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.669
 but yeah 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:02.189
 those times are over
