before and after we change the rear

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.610 
before and after we change the rear
springs<00:00:08.300> to<00:00:09.300> accommodate<00:00:09.750> more<00:00:09.990> weight<00:00:10.290> for<00:00:10.590> a

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
springs to accommodate more weight for a

plug-in hybrid conversion here's the
current<00:00:13.740> look<00:00:14.040> of<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.250> car<00:00:15.980> not<00:00:16.980> too<00:00:17.279> bad<00:00:17.580> this

already pulled out the back part of this
is<00:00:38.470> already<00:00:38.590> happening<00:00:38.710> because<00:00:39.160> we're<00:00:39.309> doing

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
is already happening because we're doing

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:42.410 
is already happening because we're doing
the<00:00:39.580> conversion<00:00:40.030> but<00:00:40.390> you<00:00:40.870> can<00:00:41.020> see<00:00:41.200> the<00:00:41.350> upper

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
the conversion but you can see the upper

for your information or up here now
we're<00:00:48.280> going<00:00:48.370> to<00:00:48.430> go<00:00:48.580> up<00:00:48.670> in<00:00:48.820> the<00:00:48.910> air<00:00:49.000> and<00:00:49.180> pull

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.540 
we're going to go up in the air and pull

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:55.380 
we're going to go up in the air and pull
it<00:00:49.660> out<00:00:50.100> there<00:00:51.100> are<00:00:51.460> the<00:00:53.070> rear<00:00:54.070> struts<00:00:54.730> before

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
it out there are the rear struts before

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.819 
it out there are the rear struts before
we've<00:00:56.230> replaced<00:00:56.680> them<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:58.660> here<00:00:59.050> are<00:00:59.260> the<00:00:59.559> rear

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
we've replaced them so here are the rear

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.930 
we've replaced them so here are the rear
struts<00:01:00.250> removed<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:02.260> can<00:01:02.320> see<00:01:02.470> the<00:01:02.950> factory

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
struts removed you can see the factory

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.660 
struts removed you can see the factory
Springs<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:05.320> then<00:01:05.470> here<00:01:05.770> are<00:01:05.950> some<00:01:05.979> Springs

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
Springs and then here are some Springs

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.730 
Springs and then here are some Springs
that<00:01:06.850> we<00:01:07.000> had<00:01:07.210> made<00:01:07.420> a<00:01:07.720> Valley<00:01:08.200> Spring<00:01:08.560> works

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
that we had made a Valley Spring works

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.740 
that we had made a Valley Spring works
in<00:01:08.890> Dixon<00:01:09.160> California<00:01:09.759> they're<00:01:10.420> actually

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
in Dixon California they're actually

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.100 
in Dixon California they're actually
directly<00:01:11.649> based<00:01:11.890> on<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:13.630> factory<00:01:13.990> spring

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
directly based on the factory spring

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.600 
directly based on the factory spring
design<00:01:14.380> so<00:01:14.920> they're<00:01:15.070> going<00:01:15.160> to<00:01:15.250> be<00:01:15.310> a<00:01:15.340> direct

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
design so they're going to be a direct

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.790 
design so they're going to be a direct
fit<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:17.080> we're<00:01:17.259> going<00:01:17.350> to<00:01:17.440> install<00:01:17.619> those<00:01:17.830> now

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
fit so we're going to install those now

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.770 
fit so we're going to install those now
okay<00:01:20.800> we<00:01:20.920> have<00:01:21.009> now<00:01:21.250> installed<00:01:21.610> the<00:01:22.360> springs

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
okay we have now installed the springs

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.290 
okay we have now installed the springs
we<00:01:23.590> can<00:01:23.770> see<00:01:23.979> that<00:01:24.160> the<00:01:24.310> ride<00:01:24.520> height<00:01:24.820> on<00:01:25.090> the

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
we can see that the ride height on the

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.510 
we can see that the ride height on the
back<00:01:25.479> end<00:01:25.750> of<00:01:25.869> the<00:01:25.960> car<00:01:26.140> is<00:01:26.520> significantly

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
back end of the car is significantly

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.290 
back end of the car is significantly
higher<00:01:28.500> with<00:01:29.500> the<00:01:30.460> back<00:01:30.640> end<00:01:30.910> of<00:01:31.000> the<00:01:31.090> car

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
higher with the back end of the car

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.330 
higher with the back end of the car
empty<00:01:31.600> this<00:01:31.990> is<00:01:32.140> essentially<00:01:32.740> what<00:01:32.950> it<00:01:33.190> would

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
empty this is essentially what it would

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.070 
empty this is essentially what it would
look<00:01:33.459> like<00:01:33.520> without<00:01:33.880> putting<00:01:34.390> a<00:01:34.539> battery<00:01:34.869> pack

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
look like without putting a battery pack

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.150 
look like without putting a battery pack
in<00:01:35.319> it<00:01:35.440> or<00:01:35.530> other<00:01:35.679> cargo<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:37.840> typically<00:01:38.319> over

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
in it or other cargo that typically over

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.749 
in it or other cargo that typically over
weighs<00:01:39.340> the<00:01:39.610> suspension<00:01:41.250> okay<00:01:42.250> so<00:01:42.310> I<00:01:42.459> am<00:01:42.580> now

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
weighs the suspension okay so I am now

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.100 
weighs the suspension okay so I am now
gonna<00:01:42.940> take<00:01:43.270> all<00:01:43.509> of<00:01:43.569> my<00:01:44.640> bags<00:01:45.640> from<00:01:46.300> my

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
gonna take all of my bags from my

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.589 
gonna take all of my bags from my
holiday<00:01:47.440> vacation<00:01:48.220> and<00:01:48.369> put<00:01:48.610> them<00:01:48.789> in<00:01:49.450> the

00:01:49.589 --> 00:01:49.599 
holiday vacation and put them in the

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:51.960 
holiday vacation and put them in the
back<00:01:49.750> of<00:01:49.869> the<00:01:49.929> car<00:01:50.140> to<00:01:50.319> see<00:01:50.500> how<00:01:51.009> it<00:01:51.280> responds

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
back of the car to see how it responds

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.389 
back of the car to see how it responds
to<00:01:52.090> that<00:01:52.360> which<00:01:52.599> i<00:01:52.690> think<00:01:52.750> is<00:01:52.929> about<00:01:53.399> 150

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
to that which i think is about 150

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.499 
to that which i think is about 150
pounds<00:01:54.789> worth<00:01:54.970> of<00:01:55.149> baggage<00:01:55.899> and<00:01:57.179> then<00:01:58.179> I<00:01:58.330> think

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
pounds worth of baggage and then I think

00:01:58.509 --> 00:01:59.520 
pounds worth of baggage and then I think
one<00:01:58.630> of<00:01:58.660> us<00:01:58.810> is<00:01:58.899> going<00:01:59.050> to<00:01:59.080> sit<00:01:59.229> in<00:01:59.289> the<00:01:59.349> back<00:01:59.500> of

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
one of us is going to sit in the back of

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.690 
one of us is going to sit in the back of
the<00:01:59.679> car<00:01:59.890> we'll<00:02:00.069> sit<00:02:00.250> really<00:02:00.610> how<00:02:00.819> it<00:02:00.940> looks

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
the car we'll sit really how it looks

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.539 
the car we'll sit really how it looks
when<00:02:01.970> the<00:02:02.650> plugin<00:02:03.650> kit<00:02:03.950> is<00:02:04.040> eventually<00:02:04.280> in

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
when the plugin kit is eventually in

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:20.550 
when the plugin kit is eventually in
itself<00:02:19.030> aha

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
itself aha

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.340 
itself aha
very<00:02:21.560> good<00:02:21.800> and<00:02:22.310> that<00:02:23.120> is<00:02:23.270> merely<00:02:23.600> stock<00:02:24.050> I

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
very good and that is merely stock I

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.710 
very good and that is merely stock I
mean<00:02:24.530> I<00:02:24.590> think<00:02:24.800> if<00:02:24.890> we<00:02:24.980> were<00:02:25.069> to<00:02:25.100> compare<00:02:25.720> that

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
mean I think if we were to compare that

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.980 
mean I think if we were to compare that
against<00:02:27.050> they<00:02:27.170> don't<00:02:27.350> it'd<00:02:27.470> be<00:02:27.530> pretty<00:02:27.709> close
