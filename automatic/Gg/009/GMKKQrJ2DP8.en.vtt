dan was such an air of optimism around
the<00:00:02.310> place<00:00:02.460> before<00:00:02.760> the<00:00:02.850> game<00:00:03.000> that<00:00:03.030> wasn't

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
the place before the game that wasn't

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.150 
the place before the game that wasn't
the<00:00:03.540> way<00:00:03.659> I<00:00:03.689> was<00:00:03.840> supposed<00:00:03.929> to<00:00:04.110> go<00:00:04.259> with<00:00:04.290> it<00:00:04.500> not

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
the way I was supposed to go with it not

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.829 
the way I was supposed to go with it not
really<00:00:05.580> I<00:00:05.759> mean<00:00:05.970> everyone's<00:00:06.240> disappointed

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
really I mean everyone's disappointed

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.440 
really I mean everyone's disappointed
and<00:00:07.280> felt<00:00:08.280> again<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:08.790> level<00:00:09.059> of<00:00:09.120> performance

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
and felt again the level of performance

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.370 
and felt again the level of performance
will<00:00:10.139> not<00:00:10.260> perform<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.740> level<00:00:11.010> of<00:00:11.099> em<00:00:12.380> all

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
will not perform the level of em all

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.200 
will not perform the level of em all
supporting<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.860> effort<00:00:14.099> was<00:00:14.400> always<00:00:14.969> there

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
supporting the effort was always there

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.870 
supporting the effort was always there
and<00:00:15.800> performance<00:00:16.800> wise<00:00:17.010> i<00:00:17.190> think<00:00:17.400> there<00:00:17.550> was<00:00:17.670> a

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
and performance wise i think there was a

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.580 
and performance wise i think there was a
time<00:00:18.210> that<00:00:18.240> we<00:00:18.570> did<00:00:18.720> pop<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:18.990> ball<00:00:19.170> down<00:00:19.350> very

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
time that we did pop the ball down very

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.140 
time that we did pop the ball down very
well<00:00:19.650> I<00:00:19.980> felt<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.250> lot<00:00:20.400> more<00:00:20.430> organized<00:00:20.939> in<00:00:21.119> the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
well I felt a lot more organized in the

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.340 
well I felt a lot more organized in the
cars<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.680> other<00:00:22.980> games<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.600> but<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:25.199> was

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
cars and the other games and but it was

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.599 
cars and the other games and but it was
just<00:00:25.529> one<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.680> those<00:00:25.800> things<00:00:25.890> when<00:00:26.310> he<00:00:26.400> looks

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
just one of those things when he looks

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.519 
just one of those things when he looks
against<00:00:26.910> it<00:00:27.090> is<00:00:27.240> i<00:00:27.269> mean<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.840> girls<00:00:28.320> took

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
against it is i mean the the girls took

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.259 
against it is i mean the the girls took
two<00:00:28.740> deflections<00:00:29.310> before<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.670> lands<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:30.060> roads

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
two deflections before it lands to roads

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.389 
two deflections before it lands to roads
and<00:00:30.480> then<00:00:30.630> I'm<00:00:30.750> not<00:00:31.470> before<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:31.920> got<00:00:32.070> chance<00:00:32.279> to

all game yes I've set that ice before
the<00:00:40.530> game<00:00:40.710> he<00:00:40.829> does<00:00:41.010> that<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.250> like<00:00:41.399> we<00:00:41.489> do<00:00:41.670> it

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
the game he does that I like we do it

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.220 
the game he does that I like we do it
you<00:00:41.910> don't<00:00:42.120> see<00:00:42.300> him<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.510> lot<00:00:42.660> in<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.780> game<00:00:42.840> but

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
you don't see him a lot in the game but

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.990 
you don't see him a lot in the game but
then<00:00:43.350> he<00:00:43.410> pops<00:00:43.649> up<00:00:43.829> when<00:00:43.950> he<00:00:44.040> scores<00:00:44.399> with<00:00:44.730> four

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
then he pops up when he scores with four

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.279 
then he pops up when he scores with four
or<00:00:45.120> five<00:00:45.329> goals<00:00:45.629> everything<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.079> played

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
or five goals everything I played

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.750 
or five goals everything I played
against<00:00:46.500> an<00:00:46.680> obscure<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:47.550> it's<00:00:47.640> just

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
against an obscure so it's just

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.700 
against an obscure so it's just
frustrating<00:00:48.149> because<00:00:48.420> as<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.260> said<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.559> don't

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
frustrating because as I said I don't

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.979 
frustrating because as I said I don't
think<00:00:50.010> he<00:00:50.160> he<00:00:50.879> did<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.120> lot<00:00:51.270> in<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.449> game<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.899> was

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
think he he did a lot in the game it was

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.170 
think he he did a lot in the game it was
death<00:00:52.710> notice<00:00:53.010> there's<00:00:53.370> more<00:00:53.550> more<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.090> a

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
death notice there's more more of a

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.319 
death notice there's more more of a

just<00:01:12.990> one<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.200> those<00:01:13.260> things<00:01:13.380> when<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.799> touch

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
just one of those things when you touch

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.160 
just one of those things when you touch
gets<00:01:14.189> away<00:01:14.369> from<00:01:14.400> your<00:01:14.670> starch<00:01:14.909> in<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.450> in<00:01:15.990> your

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
gets away from your starch in it in your

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.630 
gets away from your starch in it in your
lunge<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.590> there's<00:01:16.830> always<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.159> chance<00:01:17.460> that

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
lunge and there's always a chance that

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.580 
lunge and there's always a chance that
year<00:01:18.000> you're<00:01:18.659> going<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.900> get<00:01:18.960> sent<00:01:19.170> off<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.560> I

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
year you're going to get sent off and I

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.170 
year you're going to get sent off and I
think<00:01:19.770> he<00:01:19.860> knows<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.430> omit<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.030> wrong

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
think he knows that you omit the wrong

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.170 
think he knows that you omit the wrong
decision<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:23.159> did<00:01:23.580> change<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.909> game

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
decision and and it did change the game

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.300 
decision and and it did change the game
but<00:01:24.619> everyone's<00:01:25.619> got<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.860> get<00:01:25.979> round<00:01:26.159> I'm
