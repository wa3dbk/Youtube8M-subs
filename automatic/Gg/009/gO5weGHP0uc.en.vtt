00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:41.379 
I think it's said a lot about the

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:42.839 
I think it's said a lot about the
industry<00:03:41.769> the<00:03:41.889> fact<00:03:42.129> that<00:03:42.160> there<00:03:42.340> was<00:03:42.579> so<00:03:42.730> much

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
industry the fact that there was so much

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:47.849 
industry the fact that there was so much
backlash<00:03:43.090> and<00:03:43.859> I<00:03:44.859> know<00:03:45.250> the<00:03:45.489> David<00:03:45.819> felt<00:03:46.180> a<00:03:46.859> lot

backlash and I know the David felt a lot

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.159
