00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:11.520
 Hello, I'm here for another biology class. 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.520
 and years talk about respiratory system 

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:18.479
 then look at our initial question 

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:23.039
 what is the importance of breathing in the life of living beings 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:26.060
 expresses itself as 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.980
 hamsik to all living things for all animals and also for vegetables 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:33.170
 the main objective 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.700
 wants to transform all organic matter 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.399
 other carbohydrates 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:39.550
 in the presence of a toxin 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.210
 it's energy 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.880
 used by the senate itself in average chemical that is the atp speranza tpi 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:53.760
 the acronym atp means hair zina trip the facts that energy that has so many 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.209
 calories that will be important explained optimized by living things 

00:00:58.209 --> 00:01:01.250
 for its operation and for its development 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.060
 now another colleague's breath 

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.890
 each being 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.780
 live according to their lifestyle presents a respiratory system 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.190
 and it is this respiratory system that I would like to talk a little with 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.480
 you 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.180
 note that right now some types of respiratory system 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.520
 type of breathing animal groups 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.970
 so we have 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.360
 the first breath and cutaneous breath 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.410
 which is present in terrestrial foods 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.550
 my crazy for example and also are not adult children so this top 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.490
 have cutaneous expression 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.869
 besides to reach with then presented up in unit that allows this type of 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.490
 breath 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.390
 gill respiration we'll find us aquaticu annels 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.880
 in all three cases 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.499
 the fish married and with children 

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:53.469
 so we have 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:55.070
 edinho for example 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.290
 nothing to see a son 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.569
 breathing through the great floods 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:00.090
 during your 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.140
 aquatic 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.620
 Tracheal breathing appears - who gets everyone 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.799
 next we'll find 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:10.999
 Tracheal sheyla 

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:13.370
 which is the type of tracheal breathing 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.049
 also stay every what we have in shakhtar 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:17.329
 the chemical area says 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:22.219
 for example the beaches and the scorpions and there is like denying we will find ourselves 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:23.880
 ground molluscs 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:24.889
 the horse mackerel 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:26.209
 the amphibians 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.450
 the reptiles in the key are also mammals 

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:31.639
 It's like every month 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:32.939
 to preserve 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:36.849
 according to the type of life of the animal it presents a system 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.850
 proper that the respiratory system to perform actions 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.929
 gas exchange 

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:45.380
 so we'll start 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.590
 with a singular example 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.590
 in simple which is an example of notes where we have a breath 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.109
 cutaneous 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:56.370
 look at the picture we and we will show the type of breathing of the 

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:57.489
 earthworm 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.609
 so we have my air-15 there 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.839
 in detail to him my garden 

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:05.869
 a part of the girl's body that also 

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:06.930
 so you 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.130
 we have a cuticle the minimum amount that has been committed 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.869
 allowing the entrance of the box and genius 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.609
 and if it spends through the diffusion it ends up 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.119
 the performance of pv ptn 

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:23.630
 having grown muscle 'the aunt 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.770
 from the capillary which is a blood vessel 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.100
 and is then taken to all cells of the animal 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:34.469
 at the same time that you have the attacker's input we also have the output 

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:38.869
 of carbon dioxide and carbon dioxide following the same route 

00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:40.780
 realize that 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.430
 as well as the ice rink between the concentration difference 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.290
 knitting the environment and the body of the animal 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.139
 carbon dioxide also exits 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:53.389
 so you should be more focused 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:54.799
 for the environment 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:57.680
 so with this we have the gas exchanges 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.499
 performed there through 

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:03.339
 he asks for yasmin from the animal 

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:08.269
 another important difference is that there appears in the animals the particle 10 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.889
 so we are representing well the potent aquatic animals 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:13.059
 so with this evil 

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.930
 Christmas is there 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.609
 beyond the body of the fish 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:20.639
 that they are great because of these tools that enlarge 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.550
 that increase the surface of contact with water with you are 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:25.389
 elevating 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:29.980
 and go to the gills they present but the paths 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.440
 who are damaged and allow passage 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.730
 from the top of genius to cells 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:36.569
 of the animal 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:40.750
 so too as the third and decisive week and pardon 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.669
 record carbon dioxide gas 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:44.650
 and send it out 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.300
 out of the animal's body 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.020
 I realize that this exchange 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.020
 is an exchange occurring until the presenter 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.040
 water coming into contact with the void without the minimum 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.990
 and will have 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.770
 dismiss 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.580
 at the entrance of the genius tcic 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.580
 and the exit of the carbon dioxide in the body of the animal 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:06.050
 tracheal breathing appear the insects 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.050
 how many insects detail the presidency 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.919
 so we'll find 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:19.090
 the entrance of the actor serginho through the breathing place aperture that we have 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.499
 in the animal's body 

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:23.090
 passing through the audience 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:28.070
 and being taken by this branch shows that the waiting for a tree in those are 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.699
 kia's recipe 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:32.699
 the tree responsible for the respiration of these animals 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.370
 and realize that 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:39.499
 up until 

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:40.670
 the cell phone 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:43.820
 fabrics and farms as well as 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:48.880
 the tissues will collect the carbon dioxide and will bring carbon dioxide 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.840
 tech 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.930
 Okamoto is that she can rehearse through the test will go to colombia 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:58.710
 note that in this animal I will not do said henry 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.910
 just like baby the capillary site 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.810
 he carried a ticket to the third party 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.960
 so also how has it been so we seek 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.900
 capillaries leading to early passage 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.969
 in insects this is not going to happen 

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:14.599
 marden that is important 

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:17.950
 insects that the respiratory system 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:24.480
 it barred the sergeant until the cell to the tissues 6 the presence of 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.750
 blood flow 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.699
 without the presence of blood is right 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:30.800
 now let's continue 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.360
 with our upcoming titles and breathing
