00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
one line journal I have tried to write

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.330 
one line journal I have tried to write
my<00:00:38.520> kids<00:00:38.730> like<00:00:38.879> actual<00:00:39.210> handwritten<00:00:39.660> letters

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
my kids like actual handwritten letters

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.709 
my kids like actual handwritten letters
but<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.370> always<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:41.969> don't<00:00:42.239> always<00:00:42.360> find<00:00:42.570> the

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
but I always I don't always find the

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.930 
but I always I don't always find the
time<00:00:42.960> or<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.379> don't<00:00:44.070> always<00:00:44.340> put<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.610> letters

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
time or I don't always put the letters

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.060 
time or I don't always put the letters
into<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.390> same<00:00:45.629> place<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.649> be<00:00:46.770> able<00:00:46.890> to

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
into the same place and to be able to

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.590 
into the same place and to be able to
find<00:00:47.280> them<00:00:47.399> again<00:00:47.520> which<00:00:47.879> defeats<00:00:48.420> the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
find them again which defeats the

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.869 
find them again which defeats the
purpose<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:49.440> I've<00:00:49.559> made<00:00:49.739> an<00:00:49.860> effort<00:00:50.010> but<00:00:50.370> my<00:00:50.550> my

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
purpose so I've made an effort but my my

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.610 
purpose so I've made an effort but my my
efforts<00:00:51.210> have<00:00:51.329> been<00:00:51.480> pretty<00:00:51.750> sporadic<00:00:52.079> if

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
efforts have been pretty sporadic if

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.270 
efforts have been pretty sporadic if
you're<00:00:52.980> like<00:00:53.160> me<00:00:53.370> there<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.300> an<00:00:54.480> answer<00:00:54.809> or

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
some version of this that you can still

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.020 
some version of this that you can still
do<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:58.920> just<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.340> create<00:00:59.579> email

honestly if I heard somebody mention it

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.580 
honestly if I heard somebody mention it
or<00:01:06.000> if<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.240> just<00:01:06.270> pulled<00:01:06.720> this<00:01:06.869> idea<00:01:07.170> out<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.409> the

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
ether I honestly don't know but like I

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.410 
ether I honestly don't know but like I
said<00:01:10.260> about<00:01:10.590> about<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.159> year<00:01:11.250> ago<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.909> went<00:01:12.270> and

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
their names at gmail I think that there

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.870 
their names at gmail I think that there
may<00:01:18.509> be<00:01:18.540> value<00:01:19.080> in<00:01:19.250> sort<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.310> reserving<00:01:20.850> that

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
may be value in sort of reserving that

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.530 
may be value in sort of reserving that
that<00:01:21.570> email<00:01:22.500> address<00:01:22.860> for<00:01:23.159> them<00:01:23.430> so<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.060> you

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
that email address for them so that you

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.910 
that email address for them so that you
know<00:01:24.659> if<00:01:24.900> down<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.170> line<00:01:25.439> they<00:01:25.619> want<00:01:25.830> to

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
know if down the line they want to

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.649 
know if down the line they want to
actually<00:01:26.040> use<00:01:26.430> that<00:01:26.700> professionally<00:01:27.540> or

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
actually use that professionally or

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.649 
actually use that professionally or
whatever<00:01:27.960> fine<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.710> probably<00:01:29.400> think<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:29.970> in

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
whatever fine I probably think that in

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.450 
whatever fine I probably think that in
15-20<00:01:31.409> years<00:01:31.560> there's<00:01:31.860> going<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.070> be<00:01:32.130> some

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
15-20 years there's going to be some

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.670 
15-20 years there's going to be some
system<00:01:32.970> better<00:01:33.390> than<00:01:33.630> gmail<00:01:33.840> at<00:01:34.170> least<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.470> hope

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
system better than gmail at least I hope

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.890 
system better than gmail at least I hope
so<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:35.549> I'm<00:01:35.670> not<00:01:35.909> sure<00:01:36.060> how<00:01:36.270> much<00:01:36.420> how<00:01:36.750> much

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
so so I'm not sure how much how much

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.899 
so so I'm not sure how much how much
