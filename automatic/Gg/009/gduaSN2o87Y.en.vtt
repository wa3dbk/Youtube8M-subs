Hello and welcome to SamsungMania

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.200
In this video I will cover another application content

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:15.380
     more specificic on 360 degree videos for Samsung Gear VR

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.720
Again solution is made as a standalone app

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.000
Which is actually loading. As you can see we are somewhere in the space under the stars

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.600
Respectively, stars are all around us

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.420
In front of me theare are all available videos installed on memory card

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.720
 I can show you some example

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.240
theese are videos

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.720
among them you can look around you

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.820
I started GalaxyVR11

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.200
And we are flying to the place

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.960
where football match robots vs. humans will be held

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.700
You can enjoy flight looking around you

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.780
  sitting in space aircraft

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.094
To this was 360 degree video sample

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.940
I will see you 360 degree video of Iceland

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.300
there are volcanos, waterfalls and geysers in it

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.220
No more comments from here

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.560
Let's look in Iceland's landscape

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.600
Video is ment as a presentation from Samsung

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.780
All is captured from helicopter

00:03:11.684 --> 00:03:14.684
Let's look on another content

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:23.200
After 360 degree videos, there are also 360 photos

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.860
Tens of photos are preinstalled

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.280
You have to first choose right category

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:40.340
and select photo, you can see in 360 degree view

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:54.800
You can look around you and enjoy the view

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.220
We can look also underwater

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.260
Photos are selected using touchpad on the side of Gear VR

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.720
You are surrounded literally by shoal of fish

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.880
which are everywhere

00:04:23.967 --> 00:04:25.967
There is a lot of content

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.460
It shouldn't be problem to add here more 3D photos

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.480
so you can display them here

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.820
Let's go back to Oculus Home

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.480
Now I choose app from Samsung, VR Gallery

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:55.040
And now I can display everything what couldn't be run in 360 photos and 360 video apps

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:02.060
Other content is divided to folders

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:09.760
In this virtual spere you can select

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.180
what you need to display

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:23.480
e.g. whole slideshow, if there are only pictures in the folder

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.700
Photos are rolled as on the conveyor belt

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.700
and are displayed accordingly

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.840
I go back and try to run video

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.280
There is 3D sample

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:51.240
whch will not run in 3D (left/right or top/bottom division), so let's check 2D

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.080
There is 2D sample

00:05:55.476 --> 00:05:57.476
Let's push play

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.880
In front of me there is a private screen in VR

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:16.920
Which is displayed on big screen (virtually big as a cinema screen itself)

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:22.120
Overall, it is like sitting in a real cinema

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:40.560
So this were basic interactions of some Gear VR apps

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.940
