00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
technology came from Israel so there was

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.580 
technology came from Israel so there was
the<00:02:46.000> equipment<00:02:46.540> came<00:02:46.720> from<00:02:46.930> Germany<00:02:47.440> and

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
Japan and some that was designed on site
