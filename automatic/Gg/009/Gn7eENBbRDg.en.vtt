00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:07.550
 so hello and it's so small 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:11.460
 ipad review of the fourth generation this 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:13.469
 the experience is the same as the second and third under 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.960
 case if its difference is this such 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.800
 lightning cable i.e. it is lightning 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.140
 The input is not 30 pins but you can still be a little 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.480
 understand by this camera here because 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.660
 she became wider to me specifically review 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.810
 hit version of white with memory 16 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.149
 gigabyte with 4g module 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:36.260
 before that I had a and p 2 black 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.760
 colors 64 gigabytes 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.230
 updated ipad to the fourth generation 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.500
 very unexpected 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.530
 This happened during the presentation of the ipad 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.720
 the mini was presented to us this fourth as 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.879
 they say bye ipad ipad fourth 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.730
 generations he has the same cool 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:57.540
 design which b2 and the same as p3 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.480
 retina display and memory 16 32 64 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.940
 gigabyte and also 4g chip 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.790
 now on ipads starting from the third 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:10.350
 generations go retina display and now 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.920
 There is everything that is, if you have an iPad 3 or 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.530
 four 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.140
 if you have s6 firmware you can 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:21.450
 users are on my fingers now 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:24.960
 costs with 601 this very version weight but it 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.540
 anyway rm new since second 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.970
 ipad and exit smart whom we can 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.020
 connect smart anyone now to anyone 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.060
 ipad it will work also in ipad 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.060
 who have siri start sixth 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.420
 ios version there is also a clock application in 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.690
 which we will find the world clock 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.640
 time also with the weather is for Siri to 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.640
 find out the weather also timer and stopwatch 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.950
 after you take a couple of shots 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:59.970
 on your ipad you will understand what is there 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.540
 good camera is a 5 megapixel site 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.820
 camera and this one here is a photo 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.040
 made on i on this on this ipad and 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.220
 can i say i can confuse with 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.200
 usual picture from the internet is tiled 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.890
 the interface this side meets the sixth 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.490
 versions 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.780
 and he completely brew information you are not 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.850
 find the pixels in standard 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.400
 apps from and front camera too 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:27.240
 refreshed and now it's 720p fay set 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:30.150
 hd cameras try to get a link test 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.310
 packs this is a patchwork test application 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.490
 we put 500 and 10 attempts 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:39.000
 10 repetitions got this 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:41.160
 the result is 689 mega flops if we now 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.370
 try to pass the same test the same 500 and 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.010
 10 reps on ipad 2 we see this 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.710
 how it all goes much slower it 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:56.420
 the first thing that strikes the eye and the second 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:59.459
 we see that the result is 45 times 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.080
 different that is four five times 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.830
 the difference between the speed that is it 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.450
 very fast chip often this highway 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.660
 regardless of their maximized all 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.420
 weight anyway he is cool in hand 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.220
 and you can stand it with one hand but it 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.590
 It will survive long legs tense 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.750
 well and the main external difference from ipad 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.540
 from others it is lightning cable it also 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.130
 charges this marketing ploy which I 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.239
 now buckets of it all their devices 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:29.220
 new if we try to compare retina 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.620
 neretina display is here 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.510
 look we see the pixel in need 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.200
 get up and message you there huge 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.390
 pixels 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.880
 Now try to look at the pixel 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.930
 in the middle is almost Ipad 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.370
 unreal it is cool 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.310
 Now lightning cable takes a lot 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.620
 less space as well, and it's not thin 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.829
 the same thickness 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.230
 the arrangement of the side buttons is 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:57.379
 camera location off button and 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.090
 also headphone jack it also 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:01.400
 stayed under sim card 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.250
 If we see on the second generation ipad 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.780
 inscription 64 gigabytes of tone on the fourth 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.290
 no such inscription 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:12.290
 if you look from this angle the difference 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.410
 we almost never find and they look 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.410
 equally 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.060
 and so 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.489
 this apple is releasing a6x chip noticeably 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:25.000
 increased the speed of this a and b yes 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:27.639
 and probably could wait with 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.090
 the release of this processor to the new ipad 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.090
 fifth generation
