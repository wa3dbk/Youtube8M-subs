00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
that serious and I remember um I went to

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.609 
that serious and I remember um I went to

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
the tournament we all played on the same

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.490 
the tournament we all played on the same
connection<00:01:39.329> after<00:01:39.750> knew<00:01:40.020> his<00:01:40.140> back<00:01:40.259> at<00:01:40.409> his

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500

we dropped like one map we one of the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.109 
we dropped like one map we one of the

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.830 
landing qualify but just to get past
that<00:02:32.739> online<00:02:32.950> part<00:02:33.459> it<00:02:33.790> was<00:02:33.879> definitely<00:02:34.239> a

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
that online part it was definitely a

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.229 
that online part it was definitely a
little<00:02:35.469> bit<00:02:35.620> of<00:02:35.769> a<00:02:35.859> sigh<00:02:36.400> of<00:02:36.430> relief<00:02:36.939> I<00:02:37.150> know

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
little bit of a sigh of relief I know

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:38.759 
little bit of a sigh of relief I know
that<00:02:37.359> there<00:02:37.629> was<00:02:37.689> only<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:37.989> first<00:02:38.019> stage<00:02:38.530> of

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
that there was only the first stage of

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.559 
that there was only the first stage of
three<00:02:39.010> stages<00:02:39.280> so<00:02:39.639> obviously<00:02:40.209> the<00:02:40.329> online

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
three stages so obviously the online

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.659 
three stages so obviously the online
qualifier<00:02:41.049> the<00:02:41.560> land<00:02:41.769> qualifier<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:42.549> then

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:42.669 
qualifier the land qualifier and then

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:44.309 
qualifier the land qualifier and then
the<00:02:42.760> actual<00:02:43.120> tournament<00:02:43.450> itself<00:02:43.930> you<00:02:44.169> could

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
the actual tournament itself you could

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.170 
the actual tournament itself you could
do<00:02:44.709> really<00:02:45.040> good<00:02:45.250> on<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:45.430> online<00:02:45.609> qualifier

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
do really good on the online qualifier

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.149 
do really good on the online qualifier

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
you could play do best your abilities if

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.550 
you could play do best your abilities if
a<00:04:26.240> higher<00:04:26.360> chance<00:04:26.480> of<00:04:26.780> winning<00:04:27.050> and<00:04:27.170> usually

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
a higher chance of winning and usually

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.650 
a higher chance of winning and usually
that's<00:04:28.010> how<00:04:28.250> teams<00:04:28.520> work<00:04:28.640> so<00:04:29.180> there's

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
that's how teams work so there's

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:30.910 
that's how teams work so there's
definitely<00:04:29.900> a<00:04:30.200> lot<00:04:30.320> of<00:04:30.440> teams<00:04:30.620> going<00:04:30.830> into

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
definitely a lot of teams going into

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.020 
definitely a lot of teams going into
this<00:04:31.100> term<00:04:31.280> it's<00:04:31.520> definitely<00:04:31.820> a<00:04:31.850> lot<00:04:31.910> of

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
this term it's definitely a lot of

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.000 
this term it's definitely a lot of
really<00:04:32.330> good<00:04:32.570> talented<00:04:33.080> teams<00:04:33.320> but<00:04:33.470> it's

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
really good talented teams but it's

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.200 
really good talented teams but it's
going<00:04:34.160> to<00:04:34.220> come<00:04:34.310> down<00:04:34.370> to<00:04:34.520> the<00:04:34.730> teams<00:04:34.940> that<00:04:35.060> are

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
best call of duty and that's usually

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.220 
best call of duty and that's usually
going<00:04:38.300> to<00:04:38.420> be<00:04:38.510> the<00:04:38.630> team<00:04:38.780> that's<00:04:38.930> going<00:04:39.020> to<00:04:39.110> win

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.170 
going to be a lot of stress just like

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:43.690 
going to be a lot of stress just like
last<00:04:42.320> year<00:04:42.680> it's<00:04:43.010> give<00:04:43.130> me<00:04:43.190> a<00:04:43.250> lot<00:04:43.370> of<00:04:43.490> players

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
making some roster changes i know some

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:46.960 
making some roster changes i know some
of<00:04:45.770> the<00:04:45.860> season<00:04:46.160> 1<00:04:46.310> teams<00:04:46.550> will<00:04:46.700> probably

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
of the season 1 teams will probably

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.040 
of the season 1 teams will probably
break<00:04:47.120> up<00:04:47.360> or<00:04:47.510> they're<00:04:47.630> going<00:04:47.720> to<00:04:47.780> make<00:04:47.900> some

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
break up or they're going to make some

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.140 
break up or they're going to make some
players<00:04:48.260> swaps<00:04:48.620> if<00:04:48.770> they<00:04:48.860> can<00:04:49.070> and<00:04:49.910> i<00:04:50.000> don't

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
players swaps if they can and i don't

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.250 
players swaps if they can and i don't
think<00:04:50.330> you<00:04:50.390> need<00:04:50.480> a<00:04:50.540> player<00:04:50.750> just<00:04:50.900> season<00:04:51.140> one

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260

important in life I think with anything

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.720 
important in life I think with anything
you<00:05:21.440> know<00:05:21.530> especially<00:05:21.770> being<00:05:22.190> a<00:05:22.280> competitor

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.730 
you know especially being a competitor

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.220 
you know especially being a competitor
but<00:05:22.940> with<00:05:23.390> anything<00:05:23.720> in<00:05:23.840> life<00:05:23.990> if<00:05:24.140> you

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:24.230 
but with anything in life if you

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:25.810 
but with anything in life if you
envision<00:05:24.620> yourself<00:05:24.680> doing<00:05:25.160> something<00:05:25.310> and

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
envision yourself doing something and

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.490 
envision yourself doing something and
you<00:05:25.940> actually<00:05:26.120> work<00:05:26.510> towards<00:05:26.900> it<00:05:27.050> you're

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
you actually work towards it you're

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.810 
you actually work towards it you're
going<00:05:27.620> to<00:05:27.680> get<00:05:27.800> somewhere<00:05:28.160> along<00:05:28.370> those<00:05:28.550> lines

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
going to get somewhere along those lines

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.970 
going to get somewhere along those lines
if<00:05:29.060> not<00:05:29.240> make<00:05:29.540> the<00:05:29.840> actual<00:05:30.080> result<00:05:30.620> you<00:05:30.740> want

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:30.980 
if not make the actual result you want

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.580 
if not make the actual result you want
it<00:05:31.100> so<00:05:31.340> I<00:05:31.580> apply<00:05:32.240> that<00:05:32.420> method<00:05:32.840> to<00:05:33.020> just<00:05:33.470> about
