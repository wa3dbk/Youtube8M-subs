00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.090
 see a makeup for back to school 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.650
 so for these returns to school 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.410
 used everything you could 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.239
 use it however in a much more way 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.060
 cool so not too much 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:28.009
 accentuated some things if you can also a 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.000
 put them for example of lipstick 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.980
 and do other little things first 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.690
 see what I used 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.390
 used this do you think i paint pot 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.280
 work this out here and benefit and it's a 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.260
 pink color when golden reflections 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.320
 I spread it over the entire eyelid 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.210
 in a long way very nice bright tails 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.270
 and also fresh then for some 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.400
 little girls a little younger 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.200
 in the crease of the eye to give a little 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.810
 of depth I went to use 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.550
 another eye shadow know this here is a 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.750
 a beautiful brown brownish clear 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:05.659
 clear and this foot the coast to the sense 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.250
 then this one you see is not a line 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.649
 in the area but I did it with eyeshadow 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.229
 black that unlike wool is a lot 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:15.080
 much less accentuated though for example if 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.390
 you want to behave you are used to wearing 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.400
 black on games or not 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.799
 emphasize so markedly 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.750
 the eye can also avoid it then 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.479
 put just a little bit of 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.040
 bright eyeshadow and some of another 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:33.710
 brown color we'll call him for 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:35.440
 give depth to the eye here a sigma 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.700
 here I went to use a blush 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.430
 very nice not too much 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.920
 accentuated that peaches of marc quinn of 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.110
 a very cute peach color and here they are 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.080
 went to do some touring with 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.400
 a totally crazy land and then raises 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.130
 however second to spread a veil of 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:55.220
 this lipstick here kenwood of brands 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.840
 of the crimm cup which is a little shiny 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.430
 as you can see a rosy undertone 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.100
 very nice though this is 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.080
 use lipsticks you can totally or 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.549
 put it even to redo a 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.720
 little bit with the eyebrow pencil 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:13.260
 because I have the problem 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:17.250
 which have always been very much here 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:20.010
 thinned so I went to give too 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.500
 a real eyebrow pencil 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.010

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.740

 I use the dyed food and light and 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.160
 this Aosta Valley reproduced with your hands 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.860
 what a city can use 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.510
 translucent on the whole face especially 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.310
 if you have the skin and tend to be 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.200
 glossy made from in handbag with a 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.310
 small that the child so do 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.310
 of touch-ups during the day 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.760
 base redraw eyebrows ed 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:39.549
 I use a brown pencil the one that 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.110
 using this video essence 3d 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:43.180
 help with a specially made brush 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.980
 to comb the eyebrows so as to 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.980
 be a little bit more precise 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:14.180
 and now we come to using eye makeup 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.970
 this beautiful real cream eye shadow 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.860
 benefits which as you can see and rosÃ© 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.680
 with these beautiful golden reflections and 

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.840
 very very proud what lies in 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.340
 produced on both eyelids and ne 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.810
 I spend with my fingers 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.490
 I must say that I am anyway 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.230
 particularly extend products into 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.150
 cream with your fingers because with the premier 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.270
 hands are worked very much 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.270
 better 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.550
 with a gradient brush and that 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.790
 light brown that I had shown 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.080
 first I go to apply the color in the 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.960
 internal fold of the eye and shade it 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.430
 upwards just to give as I had 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.900
 said before a little touch of 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.900
 depth at the bar 18 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.640
 I go to work the black color with a 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:21.120
 thin brush and everything not too much 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:23.460
 soft as if it were a careful 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.010
 apply it well to blend it a little bit 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:29.870
 after which my heart is also under 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.870
 the eye reaching up to the middle 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:04.459
 opens with this mascara ds decided 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:07.580
 really very very black and so 

00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:10.729
 really very safe is a nice mascara no 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:14.209
 this is why all the eyelashes and afterwards 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:16.819
 the end pull a little bit on the outside the 

00:06:14.209 --> 00:06:20.229
 eyelashes to have this effect today 

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:20.229
 a little more elongated 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:31.990
 with a land but I'm just going to make a 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:34.479
 little point ring on the face creating type 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.849
 a 3 that goes from the temples to the colossus 

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:39.879
 of the cheekbone and then scenes that announce 

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:41.770
 smile but you can see in video camera 

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:43.889
 so even if they use a lot with 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:46.479
 touring also for photo shoots 

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:50.169
 with a little bit of product it results 

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:52.539
 already a lot this shadow area e 

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:55.569
 in fact it makes the cheekbone appear a little more 

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:57.849
 sculpted obligation then also a true of 

00:06:55.569 --> 00:06:59.650
 blush with a brush from the selections e 

00:06:57.849 --> 00:07:01.900
 very very soft which therefore makes a 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:05.430
 very nice effect is faded and therefore 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.430
 not too much accentuated 

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:25.930
 but to use this lipstick each 

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:28.449
 art is a little rosy pink that is 

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:32.999
 was recommended by a look at 

00:07:28.449 --> 00:07:32.999
 mucke and that can give very very nice 

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:46.680
 and this is the makeup girl and I hope 

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:50.500

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:52.330

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.850
 a little that I don't go to school anymore 

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:57.430
