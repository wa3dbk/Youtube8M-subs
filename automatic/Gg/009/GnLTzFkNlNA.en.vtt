yeah<00:00:06.240> well<00:00:07.240> I<00:00:07.509> think<00:00:07.689> it's<00:00:08.019> in<00:00:08.470> my<00:00:08.650> spare<00:00:08.920> for

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:09.219 
yeah well I think it's in my spare for

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:11.459 
yeah well I think it's in my spare for
with<00:00:09.429> this<00:00:09.639> software<00:00:09.880> because<00:00:10.509> one<00:00:11.259> can<00:00:11.440> show

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:11.469 
with this software because one can show

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:13.910 
with this software because one can show
it<00:00:11.860> is

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
it is

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.610 
it is
looks<00:00:14.730> like<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.300> something<00:00:15.720> based<00:00:16.350> off

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:16.620 
looks like a something based off

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.780 
looks like a something based off
possible<00:00:17.190> but<00:00:17.880> it<00:00:18.090> is<00:00:18.360> well<00:00:19.290> when<00:00:20.070> install<00:00:20.580> the

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:20.790 
possible but it is well when install the

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.570 
possible but it is well when install the
software<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.420> don't<00:00:21.810> provide<00:00:22.290> a<00:00:22.590> CL<00:00:22.980> number

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
software and don't provide a CL number

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.740 
software and don't provide a CL number
then<00:00:24.260> this<00:00:25.260> window<00:00:25.920> were<00:00:26.520> being<00:00:26.849> visible<00:00:27.480> but

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
then this window were being visible but

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.230 
then this window were being visible but
when<00:00:28.230> you<00:00:28.380> provide<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:29.130> CL<00:00:29.550> number<00:00:29.940> always

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
when you provide a CL number always

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.490 
when you provide a CL number always
start<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.289> software<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:32.540> you<00:00:33.540> don't<00:00:33.840> have<00:00:34.260> to

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
start a software and you don't have to

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.869 
start a software and you don't have to
and<00:00:36.500> you<00:00:37.500> will<00:00:37.650> see<00:00:38.040> these<00:00:38.220> and<00:00:38.489> window
