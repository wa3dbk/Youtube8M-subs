we're going to put this on and we'll
show<00:02:09.740> you<00:02:09.770> some<00:02:10.220> close-ups<00:02:10.850> once<00:02:11.450> we<00:02:11.690> get

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
show you some close-ups once we get

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.830 
show you some close-ups once we get
close<00:02:12.440> to<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:13.040> to<00:02:13.520> the<00:02:13.550> joints<00:02:14.180> so<00:02:14.540> you<00:02:14.630> can

and this is why I wanted to die this

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.670 
and this is why I wanted to die this
cabinet<00:02:20.840> is<00:02:20.990> just<00:02:21.770> for<00:02:22.100> this<00:02:22.870> just<00:02:23.870> to<00:02:24.170> see<00:02:24.980> how

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
cabinet is just for this just to see how

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.760 
cabinet is just for this just to see how
these<00:02:27.680> box<00:02:28.160> joints<00:02:28.760> just<00:02:29.060> pop<00:02:29.480> out<00:02:29.870> when<00:02:30.620> the

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
these box joints just pop out when the

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.449 
these box joints just pop out when the
dye<00:02:31.010> soaks<00:02:31.459> into<00:02:31.790> the<00:02:31.970> end<00:02:32.240> grain<00:02:32.890> and<00:02:33.890> not<00:02:34.160> to

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
dye soaks into the end grain and not to

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.940 
dye soaks into the end grain and not to
the<00:02:34.570> side<00:02:35.570> grain<00:02:36.020> how<00:02:36.350> it<00:02:36.500> just<00:02:36.740> makes<00:02:37.040> those

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
the side grain how it just makes those

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.870 
the side grain how it just makes those
you<00:02:39.950> can<00:02:40.100> really<00:02:40.459> see<00:02:41.000> how<00:02:41.270> that<00:02:42.400> that<00:02:43.400> joint

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
you can really see how that that joint

00:02:43.880 --> 00:03:10.449 
you can really see how that that joint
stands<00:02:44.300> out

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.750 

and<00:03:11.459> there's<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:12.000> full<00:03:12.560> side<00:03:13.560> of<00:03:13.829> that<00:03:14.010> that

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
and there's the full side of that that

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.199 
and there's the full side of that that
cabin<00:03:15.299> you<00:03:15.420> can<00:03:15.540> see<00:03:15.689> how<00:03:15.810> those<00:03:15.989> joints<00:03:16.769> just

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
cabin you can see how those joints just

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.209 
cabin you can see how those joints just
pop<00:03:18.209> out<00:03:18.390> like<00:03:18.450> that<00:03:18.840> so<00:03:19.500> I'm<00:03:19.650> going<00:03:19.680> to<00:03:19.980> carry

varus spin this is a handy handy
finishing<00:03:43.500> device<00:03:44.189> here<00:03:44.720> but<00:03:45.720> there's<00:03:45.930> the

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
finishing device here but there's the

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.349 
finishing device here but there's the
back<00:03:46.319> or<00:03:46.859> the<00:03:46.889> side<00:03:47.310> rather<00:03:47.639> the<00:03:47.909> one<00:03:48.060> that<00:03:48.239> we

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
back or the side rather the one that we

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.059 
back or the side rather the one that we
started<00:03:48.810> on<00:03:48.959> and<00:03:49.139> you<00:03:49.230> can<00:03:49.379> see<00:03:49.590> how<00:03:49.620> those

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
started on and you can see how those

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.569 
started on and you can see how those
joists<00:03:50.819> how<00:03:51.120> they<00:03:51.299> pop<00:03:51.689> out<00:03:51.959> because<00:03:52.829> the<00:03:53.040> the

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
joists how they pop out because the the

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.089 
joists how they pop out because the the
dye<00:03:53.970> soaks<00:03:54.540> into<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:54.989> end<00:03:55.260> grain<00:03:55.560> makes<00:03:55.950> a

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
dye soaks into the end grain makes a

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:58.849 
dye soaks into the end grain makes a
little<00:03:56.280> bit<00:03:56.519> darker<00:03:56.760> and<00:03:57.629> we'll<00:03:58.379> go<00:03:58.530> over<00:03:58.560> to

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
little bit darker and we'll go over to

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:00.679 
little bit darker and we'll go over to
the<00:03:58.980> other<00:03:59.099> side<00:03:59.370> your<00:03:59.669> society<00:04:00.209> haven't<00:04:00.480> seen

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:00.689 
the other side your society haven't seen

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:02.390 
the other side your society haven't seen
yet<00:04:00.959> and<00:04:01.019> you<00:04:01.169> can<00:04:01.319> see<00:04:01.500> how<00:04:01.530> it<00:04:01.650> does<00:04:01.950> the<00:04:02.159> same

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
yet and you can see how it does the same

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.960 
yet and you can see how it does the same
thing<00:04:02.700> how<00:04:02.909> the<00:04:02.939> joints<00:04:03.480> pop<00:04:04.079> out<00:04:04.459> and<00:04:05.459> are

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
thing how the joints pop out and are

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.629 
thing how the joints pop out and are
sort<00:04:06.180> of<00:04:06.239> emphasize<00:04:06.510> I<00:04:07.109> like<00:04:07.530> I<00:04:08.189> like<00:04:08.280> working

client is it can be a bit blotchy
sometimes<00:04:25.020> finishing<00:04:25.650> that's<00:04:26.070> why<00:04:26.280> we

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
sometimes finishing that's why we

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.480 
sometimes finishing that's why we
recommend<00:04:27.060> a<00:04:27.599> prefinished<00:04:28.349> I<00:04:28.650> didn't<00:04:29.190> do<00:04:29.310> that

carcass<00:04:45.780> is<00:04:45.990> dry<00:04:46.440> now<00:04:46.470> and<00:04:47.090> I've<00:04:48.090> gone<00:04:48.360> over<00:04:48.419> it

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
carcass is dry now and I've gone over it

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.510 
carcass is dry now and I've gone over it
very<00:04:49.139> lightly<00:04:49.470> with<00:04:49.800> the<00:04:49.949> two<00:04:50.159> hundred<00:04:50.460> and

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
very lightly with the two hundred and

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.089 
very lightly with the two hundred and
eighty<00:04:50.849> grit<00:04:51.150> sandpaper<00:04:51.630> because<00:04:52.320> this<00:04:52.860> was<00:04:53.070> a

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:53.099 
eighty grit sandpaper because this was a

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:55.460 
eighty grit sandpaper because this was a
water-based<00:04:53.699> dye<00:04:53.849> so<00:04:54.270> it<00:04:54.389> tends<00:04:54.659> to<00:04:54.960> raise<00:04:55.169> the

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
water-based dye so it tends to raise the

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.219 
water-based dye so it tends to raise the
grain<00:04:55.740> just<00:04:56.250> a<00:04:56.370> little<00:04:56.550> bit<00:04:56.789> and<00:04:57.510> it<00:04:57.690> did<00:04:57.960> and

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
grain just a little bit and it did and

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:01.399 
grain just a little bit and it did and
it's<00:04:58.860> all<00:04:58.979> nice<00:04:59.220> and<00:04:59.490> smooth<00:04:59.789> now<00:05:00.120> so<00:05:00.630> I'm<00:05:01.050> just

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:01.409 
it's all nice and smooth now so I'm just

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:04.790 
it's all nice and smooth now so I'm just
