00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.089
 not 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.050
 Yes 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.040
 the goal is to cross knowledge 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.540
 disciplines on the field of 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.040
 the layout and the city in relation 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.960
 with new technologies that it 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.970
 worth knowing with the news of 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.610
 philosophical approaches to the world with 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.010
 the concept of sustainable development and 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:33.269
 our goal was to cross 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:36.160
 these disciplines to invite young people 

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:38.350
 architects urban planners and landscapers and 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.510
 in Grenoble also we have already started a 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.210
 collaboration with the agreement is since 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.040
 two years and one goal is 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.110
 continue in this path of news 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.430
 technologies the next step is to 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.360
 say the work that was done here at 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.070
 paris so around the huge and the 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.900
 faculty of architecture will extend 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.750
 at 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.690
 at mons in march is going to be a 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:05.340
 shock that will be organized under the umbrella 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.340
 of the world architecture faculty 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.740
 no 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.660
 concretely he's working on a 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.490
 territory east of Paris 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.930
 and who is around the community 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.860
 agglomeration of marl and chantereine 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.480
 so it's a community 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.650
 agglomeration with us what we 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.690
 we had contact 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.400
 before, and who was at 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.080
 the place where really once again the 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.450
 big city meets the big 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.190
 agriculture and suddenly the city 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.770
 crumbles a little agriculture too 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.600
 agriculture has a little trouble living from 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.760
 is making its size more and more 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.160
 reduced in relation to the needs of 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.600
 two large expanses related to tools 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.890
 of production that are huge 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.820
 today we know that machines 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.560
 agricultural is big fat 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.320
 machines was extremely well 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.880
 hosted this is the most popular place the 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.440
 more in view of the city of science 1 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.370
 when we go up to see the exhibitions we 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.750
 can not miss this space there 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.460
 and then it's a space that's low and 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.900
 whoever is before the geode of still 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.120
 from the space point of view we were very 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.850
 well received and then at the human level 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.570
 so here it is a welcome absolutely 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.570
 extraordinary 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:15.790
 the overall idea of ​​the project is really 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.889
 sharing and freedom so necessarily 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.370
 finally free life is a life in all 

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:21.219
 freedom 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.129
 the purpose of this urban experiment 

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:25.689
 it's really about being able to live and 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:28.989
 to be able to change rooms at any time 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:30.340
 and not to have no good 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.709
 of equipment etc 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.510
 we can imagine there is a room and 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.799
 share in the bathrooms ya 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.709
 always a small core of room 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:40.180
 baths and blow by way 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.260
 pneumatic for example we receive the 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.000
 clothes that can be controlled remotely 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.650
 if we do not want to move in 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.719
 the shared dressing room with regard to 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.780
 sustainable development is the fact of 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:50.799
 two precisely as this principle is 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.810
 based on sharing 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:55.389
 we have no accumulation we do not have 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.510
 each a dryer of a machine to 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:57.510
 wash 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.450
 culture and agriculture are hybridized 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.670
 in this project and this takes the form of 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.860
 two full of different spacing that are 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.560
 staged with each other and 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.319
 who constitute micro species 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.660
 we are going from one to the other 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.879
 do dance either cultivate a 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.680
 vegetable garden or a shared garden would 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:26.049
 that these vegetable gardens these spaces with 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.590
 of school be experimental in terms of 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:31.060
 robotization in terms of production and 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.099
 in a general way also it's 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.810
 make people a little actor is 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:38.069
 really from the hérault raise awareness about that 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.069
 and to return to the fundamentals
