 Telephones rolling meadows to the server 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.770
 briefing the full program 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.479
 the thing is just not found anymore 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.340
 so many servers and that's why I want 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.509

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.540
 it goes in this video for such a 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.890
 website that I have already created 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.119
 30,000 subscriptions or so, however, this is 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.070
 website always so more in the background 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.330
 that's why many of you know 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.530
 this website probably not 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.360
 I'll do that again now 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.250

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.630

 You can enter me on this website 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.439
 send in some server 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.150
 otherwise that looks pretty nice 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.800
 not only servers can decide here 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.910

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.770

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.060
 So I will not forgive you if 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.320
 you do not want that 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.210

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.190
 Send in information to the people 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.290
 so you can fuck him even better 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.240

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.360
 If you can adjust your server, it could be yours 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.130

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.730
 Nice caddy server with such credit 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.410
 You can really serve servers a lot 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.030
 you can even make a fool of yourself 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.290
 but there is simply something about this topic 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.840
 not so much anymore or you choose 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.549
 recognized or the whole the servers know 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.019
 like all the stitches with that 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.310
 also works with the op plugin 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.140
 not as good this time works 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.640
 So, lettering is just a lot 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.549
 get heavier than it used to be 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.510
 That's why I do not need your help 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.090
 only I need your help 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.680
 with the ips which he sends one I will 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.390
 not only alone attacked the circle of 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.340
 as always with letters or with the 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.440
 telephone numbers of the desktops with rolls 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.360
 the tap of the economist with rolls 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.680
 that could help us just mega 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.420

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.950
 and the thing is, I want it too 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.209
 often times bring streaming but 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.709
 You can not do briefing that often 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.240
 bring because the server stops often 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.520
 That's why I'm really missing 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.070
 Use the forms and help us with that 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.660
 infinitely further because it really is not 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.070
 more as easy as it used to be 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.820
 then I would say what that with the 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.590
