00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.730 

today<00:00:07.210> I'm<00:00:07.330> going<00:00:07.450> to<00:00:07.510> show<00:00:07.720> you<00:00:07.750> how<00:00:08.170> to<00:00:08.230> use

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:08.740 
today I'm going to show you how to use

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.230 
today I'm going to show you how to use
place<00:00:09.700> value<00:00:10.090> addition<00:00:10.650> to<00:00:11.650> add<00:00:12.240> to

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.240 
place value addition to add to

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.760 
place value addition to add to
three-digit<00:00:13.869> numbers<00:00:15.150> but<00:00:16.150> also<00:00:16.710> show<00:00:17.710> you

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:17.770 
three-digit numbers but also show you

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.210 
three-digit numbers but also show you
how<00:00:17.920> you<00:00:18.430> would<00:00:19.320> regroup<00:00:20.320> from<00:00:20.560> the<00:00:20.770> ones<00:00:20.980> to

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
how you would regroup from the ones to

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.240 
how you would regroup from the ones to
the<00:00:21.310> tens<00:00:21.580> and<00:00:21.940> then<00:00:22.390> from<00:00:22.570> the<00:00:22.690> tens<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:24.100> the

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250 
the tens and then from the tens to the

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.580 
the tens and then from the tens to the
hundreds<00:00:24.840> it's<00:00:25.840> a<00:00:25.900> little<00:00:26.110> bit<00:00:26.200> different

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
hundreds it's a little bit different

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.190 
hundreds it's a little bit different
process<00:00:26.710> and<00:00:27.040> we've<00:00:27.280> learned<00:00:27.490> before<00:00:28.200> but

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:29.200 
process and we've learned before but

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.960 
process and we've learned before but
again<00:00:29.290> it's<00:00:29.590> a<00:00:29.680> process<00:00:30.100> that's<00:00:30.460> important

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 
again it's a process that's important

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.000 
again it's a process that's important
for<00:00:31.090> the<00:00:31.150> students<00:00:31.480> to<00:00:31.510> learn<00:00:31.780> as<00:00:32.739> they<00:00:32.860> learn

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
for the students to learn as they learn

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.340 
for the students to learn as they learn
about<00:00:33.190> place<00:00:33.460> value<00:00:33.910> and<00:00:33.940> addition<00:00:34.570> and<00:00:34.750> how

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
about place value and addition and how

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.910 
about place value and addition and how
numbers<00:00:35.559> work<00:00:37.109> so<00:00:38.109> again<00:00:38.320> I'm<00:00:38.589> going<00:00:38.710> to<00:00:38.769> look

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
numbers work so again I'm going to look

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.549 
numbers work so again I'm going to look
at<00:00:39.100> my<00:00:39.300> number<00:00:40.589> 386<00:00:41.589> I<00:00:41.949> know<00:00:42.909> that<00:00:43.179> 386<00:00:44.140> is<00:00:44.379> made

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
at my number 386 I know that 386 is made

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.959 
at my number 386 I know that 386 is made
up<00:00:44.739> of<00:00:44.890> six<00:00:45.219> ones<00:00:45.719> eight<00:00:46.719> tens<00:00:47.079> are<00:00:47.409> 80<00:00:47.620> and

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
up of six ones eight tens are 80 and

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.250 
up of six ones eight tens are 80 and
three<00:00:48.969> hundreds<00:00:49.449> or<00:00:49.600> 300<00:00:51.359> so<00:00:52.359> like<00:00:52.960> I've<00:00:53.079> done

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
three hundreds or 300 so like I've done

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.200 
three hundreds or 300 so like I've done
in<00:00:53.379> the<00:00:53.440> past<00:00:53.589> I<00:00:53.920> will<00:00:54.069> have<00:00:54.640> my<00:00:54.760> students

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
in the past I will have my students

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.479 
in the past I will have my students
decompose<00:00:55.749> these<00:00:55.960> numbers<00:00:56.289> up<00:00:56.469> into<00:00:56.829> base<00:00:57.219> ten

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
decompose these numbers up into base ten

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.790 
decompose these numbers up into base ten
drawings<00:00:58.949> so<00:00:59.949> the<00:01:00.670> 300<00:01:01.300> would<00:01:01.420> become<00:01:01.800> would

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
drawings so the 300 would become would

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:10.530 
drawings so the 300 would become would
look<00:01:02.979> like<00:01:03.100> this<00:01:04.620> 100<00:01:06.090> 200<00:01:07.090> and<00:01:07.240> then<00:01:08.200> 300<00:01:09.540> now

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
look like this 100 200 and then 300 now

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.870 
look like this 100 200 and then 300 now
my<00:01:10.750> 80<00:01:11.040> would<00:01:12.040> look<00:01:12.190> like<00:01:12.310> this<00:01:12.840> 10<00:01:13.840> 20<00:01:14.470> 30<00:01:15.100> 40

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
my 80 would look like this 10 20 30 40

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:23.640 
my 80 would look like this 10 20 30 40
50<00:01:16.680> 60<00:01:17.680> 70<00:01:17.860> 80<00:01:18.460> and<00:01:20.370> then<00:01:21.370> my<00:01:21.640> six<00:01:21.940> ones<00:01:22.150> one<00:01:22.930> two

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
50 60 70 80 and then my six ones one two

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.350 
50 60 70 80 and then my six ones one two
three<00:01:24.250> four<00:01:25.060> five<00:01:25.600> and<00:01:26.020> six<00:01:26.880> I'm<00:01:27.880> gonna<00:01:28.060> do<00:01:28.210> the

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
three four five and six I'm gonna do the

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:38.360 
three four five and six I'm gonna do the
same<00:01:28.600> for<00:01:29.160> 498<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:32.140> 100<00:01:33.330> 200<00:01:34.650> 300<00:01:35.650> and<00:01:35.910> then<00:01:36.910> 400

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 
same for 498 so 100 200 300 and then 400

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:46.680 
same for 498 so 100 200 300 and then 400
so<00:01:39.370> there's<00:01:39.580> my<00:01:40.020> 490<00:01:41.070> 10<00:01:42.070> 20<00:01:42.670> 30<00:01:43.090> 40<00:01:44.190> 50<00:01:45.190> 60<00:01:45.690> 70

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
so there's my 490 10 20 30 40 50 60 70

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:57.960 
so there's my 490 10 20 30 40 50 60 70
80<00:01:46.900> 90<00:01:47.140> and<00:01:47.980> then<00:01:48.610> 8<00:01:48.870> 1<00:01:49.870> 2<00:01:50.410> 3<00:01:50.950> 4<00:01:51.550> 5<00:01:53.160> 6<00:01:54.160> 7<00:01:55.150> &amp;<00:01:55.360> 8<00:01:56.970> now

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
80 90 and then 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 &amp; 8 now

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.940 
80 90 and then 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 &amp; 8 now
when<00:01:58.180> you<00:01:58.300> have<00:01:58.450> a<00:01:58.510> lot<00:01:58.930> of<00:01:59.290> drawings<00:01:59.680> like<00:01:59.800> we

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
when you have a lot of drawings like we

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.790 
when you have a lot of drawings like we
do<00:02:00.070> here<00:02:00.370> in<00:02:00.520> this<00:02:00.910> problem<00:02:01.350> it's<00:02:02.350> important

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
do here in this problem it's important

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.370 
do here in this problem it's important
for<00:02:03.010> students<00:02:03.490> to<00:02:03.550> keep<00:02:04.170> their<00:02:05.170> work

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
for students to keep their work

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.830 
for students to keep their work
organized<00:02:06.010> and<00:02:06.460> neat<00:02:06.670> and<00:02:06.970> as<00:02:07.510> you<00:02:07.659> can<00:02:07.780> see

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
organized and neat and as you can see

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.280 
organized and neat and as you can see
I've<00:02:08.319> lined<00:02:09.310> up<00:02:09.459> my<00:02:09.610> ones<00:02:09.879> place<00:02:10.239> my<00:02:10.989> tens

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
I've lined up my ones place my tens

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.700 
I've lined up my ones place my tens
place<00:02:11.590> and<00:02:11.620> my<00:02:12.010> hundreds<00:02:12.630> if<00:02:13.630> the<00:02:14.319> students

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
place and my hundreds if the students

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.800 
place and my hundreds if the students
have<00:02:14.790> drawings<00:02:15.790> all<00:02:16.090> over<00:02:16.300> the<00:02:16.390> place<00:02:16.569> and

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
have drawings all over the place and

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.809 
have drawings all over the place and
scattered<00:02:17.230> about<00:02:17.470> it's<00:02:17.740> a<00:02:18.010> lot<00:02:18.640> more

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
scattered about it's a lot more

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:19.350 
scattered about it's a lot more
difficult

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
difficult

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.970 
difficult
to<00:02:19.510> solve<00:02:19.810> a<00:02:19.960> problem<00:02:20.080> with<00:02:20.410> all<00:02:20.620> these

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
to solve a problem with all these

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.550 
to solve a problem with all these
different<00:02:21.490> drawings<00:02:21.820> because<00:02:22.380> we're<00:02:23.380> dealing

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
different drawings because we're dealing

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.290 
different drawings because we're dealing
with<00:02:23.800> numbers<00:02:24.190> with<00:02:24.310> greater<00:02:24.580> value<00:02:25.000> than<00:02:25.060> we

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
with numbers with greater value than we

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.500 
with numbers with greater value than we
have<00:02:25.480> in<00:02:25.600> the<00:02:25.630> past<00:02:25.840> so<00:02:27.150> again<00:02:28.150> I'm<00:02:28.330> going<00:02:28.450> to

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
have in the past so again I'm going to

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.450 
have in the past so again I'm going to
go<00:02:28.630> ahead<00:02:28.750> and<00:02:29.020> add<00:02:29.200> these<00:02:29.440> numbers<00:02:29.620> up<00:02:29.800> I'm

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
go ahead and add these numbers up I'm

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.290 
go ahead and add these numbers up I'm
gonna<00:02:30.640> look<00:02:30.880> in<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.480> ones<00:02:31.750> place<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:34.060> again

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
gonna look in the ones place and again

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.150 
gonna look in the ones place and again
I'm<00:02:34.450> trying<00:02:34.690> to<00:02:34.930> make<00:02:35.140> to<00:02:35.410> see<00:02:35.680> if<00:02:35.800> I<00:02:35.950> have<00:02:36.130> a

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
I'm trying to make to see if I have a

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.330 
I'm trying to make to see if I have a
group<00:02:36.610> of<00:02:36.820> 10<00:02:38.010> so<00:02:39.010> here<00:02:39.370> I<00:02:39.580> have<00:02:39.730> 8<00:02:40.210> ones<00:02:41.340> I'm

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
group of 10 so here I have 8 ones I'm

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.220 
group of 10 so here I have 8 ones I'm
gonna<00:02:42.520> use<00:02:42.700> that<00:02:42.730> 8<00:02:43.090> ones<00:02:43.330> to<00:02:43.600> go<00:02:43.750> ahead<00:02:43.870> and

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
gonna use that 8 ones to go ahead and

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.440 
gonna use that 8 ones to go ahead and
try<00:02:44.440> and<00:02:44.710> find<00:02:44.920> another<00:02:45.190> group<00:02:45.700> of<00:02:45.850> 10<00:02:46.090> see<00:02:46.360> if

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
try and find another group of 10 see if

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:47.820 
try and find another group of 10 see if
I<00:02:46.570> have<00:02:46.750> a<00:02:46.780> group<00:02:47.020> of<00:02:47.140> 10<00:02:47.320> in<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:47.530> ones<00:02:47.650> place

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
I have a group of 10 in the ones place

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.280 
I have a group of 10 in the ones place
so<00:02:49.050> I<00:02:50.050> have<00:02:50.260> 8<00:02:50.560> and<00:02:50.880> then<00:02:51.880> 2<00:02:52.150> more<00:02:52.360> from<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:53.020> six

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
so I have 8 and then 2 more from the six

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.690 
so I have 8 and then 2 more from the six
ones<00:02:53.910> that<00:02:54.910> gives<00:02:55.150> me<00:02:55.360> a<00:02:55.600> group<00:02:56.020> of<00:02:56.260> 10<00:02:56.580> so<00:02:57.580> I'm

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
ones that gives me a group of 10 so I'm

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.449 
ones that gives me a group of 10 so I'm
gonna<00:02:57.790> bring<00:02:58.180> this<00:02:58.600> group<00:02:58.870> of<00:02:59.140> 10<00:02:59.350> over<00:02:59.770> to<00:03:00.220> the

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
gonna bring this group of 10 over to the

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.699 
gonna bring this group of 10 over to the
tens<00:03:00.700> place<00:03:01.060> and<00:03:01.090> just<00:03:01.450> add<00:03:01.630> it<00:03:01.690> to<00:03:02.230> that<00:03:02.470> group

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
tens place and just add it to that group

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.320 
tens place and just add it to that group
of<00:03:02.890> 10<00:03:04.320> now<00:03:05.320> I<00:03:05.350> have<00:03:05.620> four<00:03:05.980> ones<00:03:06.370> left<00:03:06.670> over<00:03:06.880> and

of 10 now I have four ones left over and

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.000 
of 10 now I have four ones left over and
that<00:03:07.930> goes<00:03:08.170> into<00:03:08.440> the<00:03:08.620> ones<00:03:08.800> place<00:03:10.860> now<00:03:11.860> I'm

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
that goes into the ones place now I'm

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.370 
that goes into the ones place now I'm
gonna<00:03:12.130> look<00:03:12.340> at<00:03:12.459> my<00:03:12.489> groups<00:03:12.850> of<00:03:13.000> ten<00:03:13.180> I<00:03:13.540> am<00:03:14.350> a

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
gonna look at my groups of ten I am a

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.870 
gonna look at my groups of ten I am a
lot<00:03:14.650> of<00:03:14.680> groups<00:03:14.950> of<00:03:15.070> ten<00:03:15.220> so<00:03:15.370> again<00:03:15.610> I'm<00:03:15.730> gonna

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
lot of groups of ten so again I'm gonna

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.030 
lot of groups of ten so again I'm gonna
have<00:03:16.000> to<00:03:16.120> be<00:03:16.239> to<00:03:16.780> see<00:03:17.020> if<00:03:17.200> there<00:03:17.380> is<00:03:17.410> a<00:03:17.530> group<00:03:17.890> of

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
have to be to see if there is a group of

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.340 
have to be to see if there is a group of
ten<00:03:18.310> that<00:03:19.030> can<00:03:19.209> be<00:03:19.330> pulled<00:03:19.540> together<00:03:19.720> so<00:03:20.140> that

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
ten that can be pulled together so that

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.580 
ten that can be pulled together so that
ten<00:03:21.280> tens<00:03:21.610> which<00:03:21.910> makes<00:03:22.150> a<00:03:22.239> hundred<00:03:22.420> can<00:03:23.380> go

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
ten tens which makes a hundred can go

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.630 
ten tens which makes a hundred can go
over<00:03:23.860> to<00:03:24.070> the<00:03:24.310> hundreds<00:03:24.700> place<00:03:24.910> so<00:03:26.370> if<00:03:27.370> I<00:03:27.459> look

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
over to the hundreds place so if I look

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.560 
over to the hundreds place so if I look
here<00:03:27.910> I<00:03:27.970> have<00:03:28.830> one<00:03:29.830> two<00:03:30.070> three<00:03:30.190> four<00:03:30.850> five<00:03:31.120> six

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
here I have one two three four five six

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.520 
here I have one two three four five six
seven<00:03:31.810> eight<00:03:32.230> nine<00:03:32.440> ten<00:03:33.040> so<00:03:33.870> if<00:03:34.870> I<00:03:35.019> take<00:03:35.230> these

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
seven eight nine ten so if I take these

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.979 
seven eight nine ten so if I take these
nine<00:03:36.070> tens<00:03:36.400> or<00:03:36.640> this<00:03:36.820> 90<00:03:37.330> and<00:03:38.790> I<00:03:39.790> take<00:03:40.540> another

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
nine tens or this 90 and I take another

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.949 
nine tens or this 90 and I take another
ten<00:03:41.350> from<00:03:42.010> the<00:03:42.160> 90<00:03:42.790> below<00:03:43.540> it

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
ten from the 90 below it

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.100 
ten from the 90 below it
I<00:03:44.160> now<00:03:45.160> have<00:03:45.519> another<00:03:46.090> group<00:03:46.390> of<00:03:46.510> ten<00:03:46.780> which

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
I now have another group of ten which

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.630 
I now have another group of ten which
makes<00:03:47.350> a<00:03:47.440> hundred<00:03:48.150> ten<00:03:49.150> 20<00:03:49.570> 30<00:03:49.810> 40<00:03:50.170> 50<00:03:50.350> 60<00:03:51.070> 70<00:03:51.100> 80

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
makes a hundred ten 20 30 40 50 60 70 80

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.199 
makes a hundred ten 20 30 40 50 60 70 80
90<00:03:51.850> and<00:03:52.600> now<00:03:53.080> 100<00:03:53.799> so<00:03:54.670> I'm<00:03:54.760> going<00:03:54.910> to<00:03:54.970> bring

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
90 and now 100 so I'm going to bring

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.930 
90 and now 100 so I'm going to bring
this<00:03:55.480> 100<00:03:56.380> over<00:03:56.799> to<00:03:56.980> the<00:03:57.100> hundreds<00:03:57.489> place<00:03:57.670> I've

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
this 100 over to the hundreds place I've

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.090 
this 100 over to the hundreds place I've
regrouped<00:03:58.480> it<00:03:58.660> and<00:03:58.900> made<00:03:59.620> it<00:03:59.769> into<00:03:59.890> another

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
regrouped it and made it into another

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.960 
regrouped it and made it into another
group<00:04:00.670> of<00:04:00.850> 100<00:04:01.709> now<00:04:02.709> I<00:04:02.739> count<00:04:03.160> how<00:04:03.340> many<00:04:03.400> tens<00:04:03.760> I

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
group of 100 now I count how many tens I

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.520 
group of 100 now I count how many tens I
have<00:04:04.090> left<00:04:04.299> over<00:04:04.830> 10<00:04:05.830> 20<00:04:06.250> 30<00:04:06.489> 40<00:04:06.940> 50<00:04:07.269> 60<00:04:07.900> 70<00:04:07.930> and

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
have left over 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 and

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.570 
have left over 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 and
80<00:04:08.790> so<00:04:09.790> that<00:04:09.970> gives<00:04:10.209> me<00:04:10.390> eight<00:04:10.630> tens<00:04:11.440> or<00:04:11.860> 80<00:04:12.250> and

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
80 so that gives me eight tens or 80 and

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.710 
80 so that gives me eight tens or 80 and
now<00:04:13.390> I<00:04:13.420> look<00:04:13.780> at<00:04:13.900> my<00:04:14.049> hundreds<00:04:14.500> place<00:04:14.709> and<00:04:15.720> in

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
now I look at my hundreds place and in

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.670 
now I look at my hundreds place and in
my<00:04:16.840> hundreds<00:04:17.200> place

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
my hundreds place

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.880 
my hundreds place
I<00:04:17.709> have<00:04:17.950> four<00:04:18.340> hundreds<00:04:18.729> here<00:04:19.019> 100<00:04:20.019> 200<00:04:20.500> 300

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
I have four hundreds here 100 200 300

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:26.580 
I have four hundreds here 100 200 300
400<00:04:21.600> 500<00:04:22.600> 600<00:04:23.350> 700<00:04:23.650> 800<00:04:24.900> so<00:04:25.900> my<00:04:26.020> final<00:04:26.290> answer

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
400 500 600 700 800 so my final answer

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.029 
400 500 600 700 800 so my final answer
is<00:04:27.390> 880<00:04:28.390> for

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:31.039 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:33.309 

so<00:04:31.279> you<00:04:31.369> can<00:04:31.490> see<00:04:31.699> how<00:04:31.939> organization<00:04:32.930> and

00:04:33.309 --> 00:04:33.319 
so you can see how organization and

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:35.769 
so you can see how organization and
neatness<00:04:33.919> is<00:04:34.460> an<00:04:34.849> important<00:04:35.270> part<00:04:35.479> of<00:04:35.569> this

00:04:35.769 --> 00:04:35.779 
neatness is an important part of this

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:38.890 
neatness is an important part of this
strategy<00:04:36.639> especially<00:04:37.639> with<00:04:38.150> all<00:04:38.449> of<00:04:38.779> the

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
strategy especially with all of the

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.139 
strategy especially with all of the
different<00:04:39.319> place<00:04:40.099> value<00:04:40.490> drawings<00:04:40.999> that

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:41.149 
different place value drawings that

00:04:41.149 --> 00:04:44.499 
different place value drawings that
you're<00:04:41.270> gonna<00:04:41.419> make<00:04:42.639> but<00:04:43.639> this<00:04:43.819> strategy<00:04:44.029> will

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:44.509 
you're gonna make but this strategy will

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:48.010 
you're gonna make but this strategy will
help<00:04:44.539> students<00:04:45.259> to<00:04:45.409> see<00:04:45.710> how<00:04:46.449> when<00:04:47.449> we<00:04:47.569> regroup

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
help students to see how when we regroup

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.719 
help students to see how when we regroup
numbers<00:04:48.379> we<00:04:48.589> bring<00:04:48.860> them<00:04:49.009> over<00:04:49.099> to<00:04:49.339> the<00:04:49.460> tens

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729 
numbers we bring them over to the tens

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.049 
numbers we bring them over to the tens
when<00:04:50.719> we<00:04:50.839> regroup<00:04:51.499> oh<00:04:51.589> ten<00:04:52.189> ones<00:04:52.490> and<00:04:52.789> bring<00:04:52.939> it

00:04:53.049 --> 00:04:53.059 
when we regroup oh ten ones and bring it

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:55.359 
when we regroup oh ten ones and bring it
to<00:04:53.149> the<00:04:53.240> tens<00:04:53.479> and<00:04:53.749> then<00:04:54.289> how<00:04:54.499> we<00:04:54.559> regroup<00:04:55.189> a

00:04:55.359 --> 00:04:55.369 
to the tens and then how we regroup a

00:04:55.369 --> 00:04:58.450 
to the tens and then how we regroup a
group<00:04:55.580> of<00:04:55.789> tens<00:04:56.719> ten<00:04:57.229> tens<00:04:57.529> and<00:04:57.800> bring<00:04:58.189> it<00:04:58.309> to

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
group of tens ten tens and bring it to

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.700 
group of tens ten tens and bring it to
the<00:04:58.580> hundreds<00:04:58.969> this<00:04:59.659> just<00:04:59.899> helps<00:05:00.020> students<00:05:00.680> to

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
the hundreds this just helps students to

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.260 
the hundreds this just helps students to
really<00:05:01.009> understand<00:05:01.490> the<00:05:01.580> concept<00:05:02.089> of

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
really understand the concept of

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.309 
really understand the concept of
regrouping<00:05:04.089> so<00:05:05.089> this<00:05:05.330> again<00:05:05.629> is<00:05:05.689> a<00:05:05.960> place

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:06.319 
regrouping so this again is a place

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:09.459 
regrouping so this again is a place
value<00:05:06.680> addition<00:05:06.919> with<00:05:07.550> two<00:05:08.469> three-digit

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:09.469 
value addition with two three-digit

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:13.600 
value addition with two three-digit
numbers<00:05:09.879> that<00:05:10.879> each<00:05:11.270> has<00:05:12.050> to<00:05:12.349> every<00:05:13.189> time<00:05:13.399> we

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
numbers that each has to every time we

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.429 
numbers that each has to every time we
have<00:05:13.759> to<00:05:13.909> regroup<00:05:14.539> a<00:05:14.689> number<00:05:14.960> from<00:05:15.050> the<00:05:15.139> ones

00:05:15.429 --> 00:05:15.439 
have to regroup a number from the ones

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:17.499 
have to regroup a number from the ones
to<00:05:15.680> the<00:05:15.800> tens<00:05:16.039> and<00:05:16.339> from<00:05:16.879> the<00:05:16.969> tens<00:05:17.180> to<00:05:17.419> the

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:17.509 
to the tens and from the tens to the

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:19.870 
to the tens and from the tens to the
hundreds
