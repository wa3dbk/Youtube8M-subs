youtubes<00:00:37.499> I<00:00:37.710> think<00:00:37.920> their<00:00:38.010> policy<00:00:38.429> thing<00:00:38.609> is

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
youtubes I think their policy thing is

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.790 
youtubes I think their policy thing is
you<00:00:38.850> can't<00:00:39.059> say<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.329> want<00:00:39.749> you<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.019> go<00:00:40.140> over<00:00:40.170> here

to<00:00:40.859> watch<00:00:41.190> this<00:00:41.399> video<00:00:41.609> because<00:00:41.940> then<00:00:42.179> that's

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
to watch this video because then that's

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.090

a<00:00:42.480> violation<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:43.109> their<00:00:43.260> policy<00:00:43.679> whatever<00:00:43.949> and

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
a violation of their policy whatever and

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.430 
a violation of their policy whatever and

number<00:02:22.819> one<00:02:22.849> cheapest<00:02:23.420> place<00:02:23.599> to<00:02:23.629> get<00:02:23.870> gas<00:02:24.110> and

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
number one cheapest place to get gas and

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.430 
number one cheapest place to get gas and
it's<00:02:25.129> dollar<00:02:25.459> twenty<00:02:26.000> three<00:02:26.299> point<00:02:26.660> four<00:02:27.049> per

it's dollar twenty three point four per
liter<00:02:27.879> so<00:02:28.879> I<00:02:29.299> think<00:02:29.450> anywhere<00:02:30.080> else<00:02:30.260> it'd<00:02:30.410> be

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
liter so I think anywhere else it'd be

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.460 
liter so I think anywhere else it'd be
like<00:02:30.650> twenty<00:02:31.099> nine<00:02:31.370> tip<00:02:32.170> sorry<00:02:33.170> at<00:02:33.290> dollar

like twenty nine tip sorry at dollar

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.729 
like twenty nine tip sorry at dollar
twenty<00:02:33.799> nine<00:02:33.950> to<00:02:34.190> a<00:02:34.220> dollar<00:02:34.430> thirty<00:02:34.849> plus<00:02:35.739> so

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
twenty nine to a dollar thirty plus so

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.640 
twenty nine to a dollar thirty plus so
this<00:02:36.920> is<00:02:37.099> the<00:02:37.370> ultimate<00:02:37.790> place<00:02:37.970> to<00:02:38.120> get<00:02:38.390> gas
