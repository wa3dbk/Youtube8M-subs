ate<00:00:27.260> together<00:00:27.439> I<00:00:27.920> think<00:00:28.849> the<00:00:28.939> pen<00:00:29.119> tool<00:00:29.150> is

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
ate together I think the pen tool is

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.540 
ate together I think the pen tool is
better<00:00:29.599> than<00:00:29.720> mouse<00:00:29.960> because<00:00:30.500> it's<00:00:31.189> just<00:00:31.340> so

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
better than mouse because it's just so

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.060 
better than mouse because it's just so

for<00:01:06.259> it<00:01:06.380> and<00:01:06.500> then<00:01:06.830> we<00:01:07.009> decided<00:01:07.369> we<00:01:07.580> wanted<00:01:07.789> to

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
for it and then we decided we wanted to

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.730 
for it and then we decided we wanted to
make<00:01:08.030> it<00:01:08.210> interactive<00:01:08.420> so<00:01:09.020> what<00:01:09.200> I<00:01:09.229> did<00:01:09.350> is<00:01:09.530> I

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
make it interactive so what I did is I

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.590 
make it interactive so what I did is I
took<00:01:09.979> the<00:01:10.280> existing<00:01:10.820> elements<00:01:11.210> of<00:01:11.270> my<00:01:11.330> print

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
took the existing elements of my print

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.600 
took the existing elements of my print
page<00:01:11.780> then<00:01:12.410> a<00:01:12.440> little<00:01:12.740> rearranging<00:01:12.950> put<00:01:13.580> a

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
page then a little rearranging put a

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.449 
page then a little rearranging put a
little<00:01:13.819> bit<00:01:14.000> of<00:01:14.229> animation<00:01:15.229> to<00:01:15.590> it<00:01:15.709> and<00:01:16.099> then

00:01:16.449 --> 00:01:16.459 
little bit of animation to it and then

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:18.190 
little bit of animation to it and then
we<00:01:16.640> decided<00:01:16.970> well<00:01:17.209> this<00:01:17.390> is<00:01:17.539> great<00:01:17.690> let's<00:01:17.899> uh
