minor fixes for the game as opposed to

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.050 
minor fixes for the game as opposed to
actual<00:03:50.560> features<00:03:51.100> and<00:03:51.490> I<00:03:51.580> guess<00:03:51.910> you<00:03:52.030> could

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
actual features and I guess you could

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.600 
actual features and I guess you could
kind<00:03:52.390> of<00:03:52.480> consider<00:03:52.870> the<00:03:53.440> fences<00:03:53.920> features

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
kind of consider the fences features

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.180 
kind of consider the fences features
because<00:03:55.030> they<00:03:55.510> did<00:03:55.660> add<00:03:55.870> more<00:03:56.200> blocks<00:03:56.620> in<00:03:56.860> that

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
because they did add more blocks in that

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.490 
because they did add more blocks in that
