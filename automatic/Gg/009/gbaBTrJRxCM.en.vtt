00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
it does cover up the home button just a

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.550 
it does cover up the home button just a
little<00:01:41.939> bit<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:43.079> that's<00:01:43.259> something<00:01:43.470> to

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
little bit so that's something to

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.380 
little bit so that's something to
consider<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:44.159> then<00:01:44.520> you've<00:01:44.670> got<00:01:44.880> your<00:01:44.909> camera

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
consider and then you've got your camera

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.780 
consider and then you've got your camera
there<00:01:45.750> that<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.140> in<00:01:47.009> no<00:01:47.250> way<00:01:47.369> shape<00:01:47.579> or<00:01:47.729> form

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.090 
there that is in no way shape or form
covered<00:01:48.299> up<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:48.450> that's<00:01:48.750> nice<00:01:48.930> this<00:01:49.530> case<00:01:49.799> does

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
covered up so that's nice this case does

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.819 
covered up so that's nice this case does
not<00:01:50.490> incorporate<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.659> sleep<00:01:52.140> or<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.439> awake

will be maybe cut that area out a little
bit<00:02:42.599> more<00:02:42.810> so<00:02:43.019> it<00:02:43.079> doesn't<00:02:43.379> cover<00:02:43.590> up<00:02:43.799> the<00:02:43.980> home

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:44.249
