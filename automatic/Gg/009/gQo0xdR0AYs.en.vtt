00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.360
 This very sad video, my life. 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.679
 too complicated lately know lacks 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.100
 time to produce the videos by 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.900
 cause of work the fly flying here 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.270
 task overload lack of 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.609
 A girlfriend, anyway. 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.539
 compares the difficult life that some 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.619
 videogame characters take each 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.050

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.480
 in this video shown the seven characters 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.070
 I did seven I showed the five fingers 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.920
 because I was holding here in the 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.469
 truth 1 617 because I did not count more 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.510
 I think they are characters who 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.780
 I at least remembered that now that it takes 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.059
 a great burden on the back that is called 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.890
 life and that they serve as examples for 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.340
 others do not make the same mistakes 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.039
 in life ita mars love its 36 years 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.500

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.920
 stable and comfortable but two years 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.380
 then your life changes completely by 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.220

 You can give shit. 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.640
 The boy ran out and entered the 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.640
 front of the car to save his life 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.360

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.269
 if you think the thrashers and in the beginning 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.790

 Wonderful old man, I'm done. 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:53.150
 only hand and another character that I 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:54.739
 I thought it was a scare I think it's 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.510
 recording here one of the characters also 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.120
 that came to mind like this when I thought 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.600
 in making this video was the poor isaac 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.850
 He spends his life facing 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.680
 necromorphs only going to 9x Moorish 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.640
 to help in repairs still visit 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.609
 your girlfriend 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.859
 'in these simple tranquilities in the life of 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:14.480
 our character becomes hell 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:17.120
 from the moment the ship is taken 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.250
 by creatures that exterminated the 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.620
 crew there my son had to 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.570
 turn that power too much to dismember 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.260
 necromorphs as if there were no 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.570
 tomorrow 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.920
 but he is an obsessive character and his 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.930
 willpower has made him 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.480
 survived all this beyond his 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.890
 want to meet your girlfriend Nicole 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.040
 but then when he finds out that she is 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.750

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.580
 of course, it is still guided by 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.830
 apparitions of nicole 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.200
 crazy in stone and even then after 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:48.260
 all these tragic events 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.260
 he can survive shimura escape 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:55.280
 but he wakes up in the hospital that seems 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.930
 a madhouse infested with necromania I 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.760
 I would rather die if I were on the skin. 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.620
 of him I wonder how it is that 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.420
 anyone can get into a little life 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.100
 so unhappy that 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.340
 in this video could not fail to mention 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:09.830
 the beloved so beloved nico rosberg 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.110

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.800
 abused by alcoholic father lost 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.750
 family friends trafficked people were 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.000
 many things that happened in the 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.709
 life of the one and beyond all this yet 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.750

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.760
 play bowling every two minutes 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.550
 sure this taboo and all the other things 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.800
 that happen with the life of the one who 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.280
 what he does in liberty city becomes 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.860
 chip the credit or kratos or call 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:40.310
 of Kratos equal to Azaghal the god of war 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:42.350
 also had a disgraceful life since the 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.990
 first game he felt the intense fury 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.030
 by the god aria areas made kratos 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.610
 in the moment of fury in his own 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.230
 woman and her daughter the oracle of the village of 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.000
 water curse entrances that from 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.540
 of that moment would carry on his 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.390
 skin 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.940
 the ashes of their dead relatives as 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:00.650
 penalty of their acts and after that 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.169
 he became known as the ghost of 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.370
 Sparta because of his pale skin 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:06.190
 from this the life of our 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:09.560
 protagonist becomes a bloodbath 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.280
 deaths of suffering in search of 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.190
 revenge 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.770
 I do not think I need to say anything else to 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.150
 Calm life of joy is interrupted well. 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.190
 away from his birthday when a 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.600
 plague on the world party 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:32.300
 but the worst of it is when your daughter 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:34.430
 Sara dies in his arms and until the end of 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.470
 game the character goes through so much 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.130
 that also I do not need to say anything else 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.750
 huh 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.610
 another character that also came to me 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.860
 head as soon as I thought about this subject I 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.550
 I did not have to put on the list is the 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.040
 poor 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:48.770
 max payne the life of the poor max is one 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:51.050
 tragedy he also had a life 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.260
 perfect 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:56.050
 a successful police officer 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:58.570
 married and just having a daughter and via 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:01.540
 the American dream is coming true 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:04.090
 but all this was over on one night of your 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:06.370
 house was overrun by drug addicts 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:09.000
 valkyrie when max was working 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.300
 and his wife and daughter were 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.880
 murdered 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.110
 From this his life became lonely. 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.580
 sadness 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.890
 max then starts working on the 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.900
 narcotics department of new york 

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:22.060
 moved by revenge a lot 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.800
 happens in the life of our poor max as 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.260
 I said at the beginning here when I was going to speak 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.790
 He was the first person to come to 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.130
 when I thought of doing this 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:33.340
 theme and if you played only the last 

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:35.110
 title of the franchise that was the max payne 3 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:38.110
 Can you already realize that life 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.940
 It's not just joy, it's not just not 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:41.680
 Truth does not have anything I think there are no 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.170
 except to take some that once in 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.300
 when almost every moment of the game 

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:50.170
 you notice our protagonists 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:52.060
 clogged with whiskey drinks and painkillers 

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:55.090
 and here in Brazil where you play the game 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:56.890
 our poor max payne suffers the bread that the 

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:59.200
 devil kneaded with his feet 

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:01.600
 I literally do not know how he 

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:05.410
 can survive so much 

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:07.810
 well I'll finish this sad list here 

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:09.700
 that this list were the characters that 

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:11.620
 I remembered now that I did 

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:14.290
 to make this theme more and one priest 

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:16.000
 discussion on this topic as well 

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:18.130
 several other characters it is clear that 

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.080

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:23.020
