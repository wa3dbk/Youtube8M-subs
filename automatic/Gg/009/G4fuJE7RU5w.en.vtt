 Unfortunately, the ad just kind of obscured the grid and its two 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.240
 powerful arguments but it also makes you play Maximilian 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.880
 clear 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.599
 Tuft Malus seen 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:28.639
 and the same is true for the entire graphics of man 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.730
 Hinrichsen extremely Beatty and 6 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.110
 but it's not just about the look that counts, but also the inner values 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.020
 percent 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.530
 yes says you have to exchange 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.670
 I have to get used to the controls extremely hard 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.770
 I have to agree with you and that percent of this new feature one 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.020
 supply bottleneck 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.180
 the percent demands a lot of practice as a taxman quite normal 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.979
 this year with me 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:58.030
 with the left stick so it will succeed - the lesson is not 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.180
 Percent is used to maintain the posture of the body 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.600
 Central Council too 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.100
 to prevent 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.200
 So that means rather in so-called tight curves like here Mendig not only one but 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.420
 as well as the right stick to the right and the driver to the last 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.400
 moment 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.830
 Under drivers, customers can drive through much narrower 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.450
 But there are not only these plans before dangerous routes but also 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.200
 For such open-world races quasi-percent rocky terrain easy 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.200
 a certain way points like here you will find out 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.300
 later there are even events in which all vehicle classes in four 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.700
 of ten clashes Baso motorcycles 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.650
 Paris 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.650
 around Enn Tracks and the Red Devils 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.710
 Trakr in Vienna / stock exchange 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.430
 We have to raise ourselves for the World Cup that they secretly exist for so long 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.850
 Roland Döhrn also has one here compared to its predecessor Dietrich 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.070
 currents 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.090
 Olé the controls changed so you have to get around in the air and with 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.510
 to execute the n1 that are included and then 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.469
 make the combination with the right stick 

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:17.479
 For example, basically nothing and then such things come out of it 

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:21.029
 have seen under this accident in England 

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:24.569
 he also went through control with the Flex 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.870
 because to avoid falls - so in time for the mighty 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.599
 Direction you are going now 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.069
 said then I can still catch the fall 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.569
 round 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.489
 I'll show it to you on the basis of a Donath 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.530
 like here in tracks Reese like the necessary tests 

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:42.510
 10 o'clock in the forms 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.780
 in order to playfully from Mettmann one whispers there really so Tillich the 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.289
 previous through 

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:50.339
 and that is not all 

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:52.449
 we have optical delicacies 

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:55.839
 and Anette's Blitz can also play along exactly and wants to see you here 

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:57.649
 very good the class 

00:02:57.649 --> 00:03:01.179
 This game overall is not only designed to be hostile to the motorcycles 

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:04.939
 is more worried and bother the four-wheeled fellow 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:08.939
 Violas are just the ones who lack the control there is 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:11.649
 not so great is that a lot of feedback 

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:13.739
 does not fit all that 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.209
 So who predominantly engine front 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.159
 your good advice otherwise tends to 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:21.599
