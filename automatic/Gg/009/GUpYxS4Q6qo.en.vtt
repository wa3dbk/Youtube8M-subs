you're going to be in a position like

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.580 
you're going to be in a position like
this<00:06:09.759> I<00:06:10.120> know<00:06:10.300> internally<00:06:10.900> the<00:06:11.229> team<00:06:11.409> was

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:11.590 
this I know internally the team was

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:16.379 
this I know internally the team was
pretty<00:06:11.830> shaky<00:06:12.599> can<00:06:13.599> you<00:06:13.750> I<00:06:14.050> know<00:06:15.150> post<00:06:16.150> TI

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:16.389 
pretty shaky can you I know post TI

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:18.269 
pretty shaky can you I know post TI
there's<00:06:16.719> a<00:06:16.750> huge<00:06:16.990> fall<00:06:17.229> out<00:06:17.409> can<00:06:17.979> you<00:06:18.099> guys

00:06:18.269 --> 00:06:18.279 
there's a huge fall out can you guys

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:19.920 
there's a huge fall out can you guys
survive<00:06:18.639> for<00:06:18.880> all<00:06:18.969> that<00:06:19.120> regardless<00:06:19.569> of<00:06:19.779> what

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:19.930 
survive for all that regardless of what

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.689 
survive for all that regardless of what
happens<00:06:20.020> now<00:06:20.440> just<00:06:20.889> just<00:06:21.219> based<00:06:21.430> on<00:06:21.610> the

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:21.699 
happens now just just based on the

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:23.249 
happens now just just based on the
results<00:06:22.029> so<00:06:22.150> far<00:06:22.180> different<00:06:22.569> or<00:06:22.960> is<00:06:23.020> it<00:06:23.139> too

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:23.259 
results so far different or is it too

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:25.290 
results so far different or is it too
early<00:06:23.289> to<00:06:23.560> tell<00:06:23.740> I<00:06:23.949> think<00:06:24.669> it's<00:06:24.759> early<00:06:24.940> to<00:06:25.120> tell

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.300 
early to tell I think it's early to tell

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.290 
early to tell I think it's early to tell
obviously<00:06:26.289> if<00:06:26.710> you<00:06:27.009> we<00:06:27.520> cannot<00:06:27.729> we<00:06:27.940> can<00:06:28.090> still

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.300 
obviously if you we cannot we can still

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.290 
obviously if you we cannot we can still
win<00:06:28.419> TI<00:06:28.659> right<00:06:28.990> now<00:06:29.169> or<00:06:29.380> we<00:06:29.680> can<00:06:29.830> place<00:06:30.039> like<00:06:30.300> 10

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:31.300 
win TI right now or we can place like 10

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.320 
win TI right now or we can place like 10
12

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.330 
12

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.779 
12
so<00:06:32.840> I<00:06:33.169> think<00:06:33.770> that's<00:06:34.069> a<00:06:34.129> huge<00:06:34.310> difference<00:06:34.490> in

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:34.789 
so I think that's a huge difference in

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:36.570 
so I think that's a huge difference in
how<00:06:35.449> far<00:06:35.689> you<00:06:35.840> go<00:06:35.930> in<00:06:36.020> this<00:06:36.110> tournament

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:36.580 
how far you go in this tournament

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.290 
how far you go in this tournament
obviously<00:06:37.580> there's<00:06:37.789> going<00:06:37.849> to<00:06:38.030> be<00:06:38.060> a<00:06:38.120> lot<00:06:38.270> of

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:38.300 
obviously there's going to be a lot of

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.540 
obviously there's going to be a lot of
teams<00:06:38.569> disbanding<00:06:39.139> after<00:06:39.740> TI<00:06:39.860> but<00:06:40.129> I<00:06:40.280> don't

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:40.550 
teams disbanding after TI but I don't

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.700 
teams disbanding after TI but I don't
it's<00:06:40.819> really<00:06:41.060> hard<00:06:41.210> to<00:06:41.330> let's<00:06:42.110> say<00:06:42.229> you<00:06:42.289> do<00:06:42.439> top

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:42.710 
it's really hard to let's say you do top

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.399 
it's really hard to let's say you do top
8<00:06:42.889> which<00:06:43.430> is<00:06:43.639> at<00:06:43.909> the<00:06:44.000> moment<00:06:44.389> half<00:06:45.139> a<00:06:45.259> million

00:06:45.399 --> 00:06:45.409 
8 which is at the moment half a million

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:49.179 
8 which is at the moment half a million
dollars<00:06:47.020> thing<00:06:48.020> would<00:06:48.169> stick<00:06:48.530> together<00:06:48.680> for
