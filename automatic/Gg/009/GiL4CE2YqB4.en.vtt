00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.859 
had this one before this is a newer beer
from<00:00:26.910> Guinness<00:00:27.590> I'm<00:00:28.590> used<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:28.980> their

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
from Guinness I'm used to their

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.770 
from Guinness I'm used to their
traditional<00:00:30.869> stop<00:00:31.320> style<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:32.099> beer<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:33.540> this

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
traditional stop style of beer and this

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.200 
traditional stop style of beer and this
is<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:33.989> black<00:00:34.290> lager<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:35.190> says<00:00:35.520> roasted

is a black lager that says roasted
barley<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:37.280> I<00:00:38.280> believe<00:00:38.670> this<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:38.910> out<00:00:39.210> of

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
barley and I believe this is out of

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.840 
barley and I believe this is out of
Ireland<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.020> it's<00:00:41.149> 11.2<00:00:42.149> ounces<00:00:43.040> not<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.070> 12

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
Ireland and it's 11.2 ounces not a 12

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.319 
Ireland and it's 11.2 ounces not a 12
ounce<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.629> couple<00:00:45.960> points<00:00:46.500> off<00:00:46.649> for<00:00:46.680> that

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
ounce so a couple points off for that

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:49.760 
ounce so a couple points off for that
that's<00:00:48.329> alright<00:00:48.750> hopefully<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.289> tastes<00:00:49.620> good

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.900 
like Guinness you got to give this a
shot<00:02:44.880> if<00:02:45.269> you<00:02:45.300> like<00:02:45.569> York<00:02:46.220> your<00:02:47.220> stouts<00:02:47.580> this

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
shot if you like York your stouts this

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.880 
shot if you like York your stouts this
is<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:48.120> light<00:02:48.769> light<00:02:49.769> step<00:02:50.580> it's<00:02:50.970> not<00:02:51.300> real

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
is a light light step it's not real

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.150 
is a light light step it's not real
thick<00:02:53.989> probably<00:02:54.989> not<00:02:55.140> super<00:02:55.680> high<00:02:55.830> on<00:02:56.010> that

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
thick probably not super high on that

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.330 
thick probably not super high on that
the<00:02:56.459> calorie<00:02:56.910> content<00:02:57.150> for<00:02:57.720> sure<00:02:57.930> um<00:02:58.230> I<00:02:59.220> think

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
the calorie content for sure um I think
