00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.100
 one computer per child 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.400
 if that is our name and our vision 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.040
 we want to create education opportunities for the poorest children 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.770
 of the world carrying each one of them a rigid computer of low consumption 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.859
 low cost electric with internet connection 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:18.349
 and the cinema 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:20.489
 yes a lioness to the x 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:24.329
 it's a computer like no other design that system that will be delayed 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:26.579
 your extreme positions and we deserve it 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:30.839
 will be charged with about Syria decided the analysis learn explore is a 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:35.100
 important party more understandable site if haiti just gets between them 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.940
 health with better future 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.570
 We are a non-profit organization 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.920
 what makes these children in this ad not in our market 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.080
 that's why to any place that the ovalle x there are five basic principles 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.810
 with which everyone agrees 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.160
 first the children can stay with the computers they should be free of 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.640
 take them to squares at the time they wish 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.640
 second we focus on early education 11 children between 6 and 12 years 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.320
 third 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.520
 we have to deal with large cross numbers so all the salons 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.750
 and schools receive it at the same time 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.750
 so nobody 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.240
 children must have an internet connection because there are things 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.510
 who need to learn through the internet 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:15.590
 fifth and last 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.840
 the xo must include free software 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.010
 Free villafuerte for the laptop to be updated adapts to the needs 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.930
 of the child then these are worlds or 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.560
 an organization that makes a small computer serve a large 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.300
 cause 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.710
 bring education to children around the world with one computer per child 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.770
 The real question is 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.270
 for having a laptop for a child who might not have electricity or water 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.090
 potable 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.700
 that's a very good question 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.080
 but if you substitute the word in the act 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.179
 for education 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:48.400
 the answer is clear 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.340
 The education 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.650
 does not stop giving until the other acts have been resolved 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.920
 It is done at the same time 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.490
 because education is the basis of the other solutions 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.090
 that's why they say unfairly jail 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.610
 places that are most needed 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.750
 2k because they are 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.140
 and children tend to be 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.589
 low cost to be able to do it 

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:14.120
 by necessity of little current so that even in places without electricity zones 

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:15.759
 recharge available 

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:18.119
 the activity as emergency 

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:21.080
 with connectivity so children can access the internet 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.109
 share files 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:24.239
 between them and collaborate 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.860
 the xo also has a screen on which you can see under the sunlight 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:31.049
 direct because many of the children we reach attend schools and 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:31.949
 walls 

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:35.650
 mexico has a webcam that takes photos and video in addition to 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.259
 many educational programs 

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:39.249
 all this and much much more 

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:40.989
 in only a rebound between 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.730
 When a X or Y is causal or not to a village, children are compromised 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.060
 inspired they go to school more often and stay in it for more 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.569
 weather 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.709
 tin tÃ¡n play music make movies write stories 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.939
 then on how to do good intentions and injuries to others 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:56.529
 even been 

00:02:56.529 --> 00:03:00.199
 successfully children learn to solve their own challenges and travel 

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:02.349
 from the boss of mercedes ours 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.860
 that's how we will change the world and it is the best answer to cooperate 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:06.610
 computer 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.599
 then computers change the world
