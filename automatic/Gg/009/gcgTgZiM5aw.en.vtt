that<00:00:47.460> once<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.700> get<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.910> learn<00:00:48.090> all<00:00:48.300> about

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
that once you get to learn all about

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.930 
that once you get to learn all about
that<00:00:48.780> PDW<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.680> then<00:00:50.070> maybe<00:00:50.280> get<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.550> sense<00:00:50.820> of

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
that PDW and then maybe get a sense of

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.060 
that PDW and then maybe get a sense of
what<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.360> would<00:00:51.570> compares<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.170> MSMC<00:00:52.559> before

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
what I would compares to the MSMC before

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.709 
what I would compares to the MSMC before
I<00:00:53.100> do<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.489> official<00:00:53.879> con<00:00:54.059> comparison<00:00:54.539> between

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
I do the official con comparison between

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.080 
I do the official con comparison between
the<00:00:54.930> two<00:00:55.170> submachine<00:00:55.800> guns<00:00:56.010> anyways<00:00:56.760> guys<00:00:56.910> now

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
the two submachine guns anyways guys now

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.979 
the two submachine guns anyways guys now
that<00:00:57.120> we<00:00:57.300> got<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.449> out<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.840> way<00:00:57.899> let's

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
that we got that out of the way let's

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.330 
that we got that out of the way let's
jump<00:00:58.320> straight<00:00:58.379> into<00:00:58.649> some<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:58.920> these<00:00:59.010> stats

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
jump straight into some of these stats

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.860 
jump straight into some of these stats
and<00:00:59.579> learn<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.699> little<00:00:59.940> bit<00:01:00.030> about<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.390> MSMC

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
and learn a little bit about the MSMC

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.049 
and learn a little bit about the MSMC
and<00:01:01.260> how<00:01:01.530> good<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.859> weapon<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.520> or<00:01:02.789> maybe

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
and how good of a weapon it is or maybe

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.549 
and how good of a weapon it is or maybe
how<00:01:03.270> much<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.600> nerf<00:01:03.780> weapon<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.350> now

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
how much of a nerf weapon it is now

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.219 
how much of a nerf weapon it is now
first<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.400> all<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.610> MSMC<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.450> unlocked<00:01:07.049> at

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
first of all the MSMC is unlocked at

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.620 
first of all the MSMC is unlocked at
level<00:01:07.260> 28<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.760> one<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.330> submachine

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
level 28 it is a one of the submachine

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.300 
level 28 it is a one of the submachine
guns<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.110> get<00:01:10.260> rather<00:01:10.530> quickly<00:01:10.979> so<00:01:11.280> you

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
guns that you get rather quickly so you

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.250 
guns that you get rather quickly so you
don't<00:01:11.520> have<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.790> work<00:01:12.330> as<00:01:12.450> hard<00:01:12.510> as<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.869> do<00:01:13.020> to

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
don't have to work as hard as you do to

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.750 
don't have to work as hard as you do to
get<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.650> one<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.950> say<00:01:14.159> as<00:01:14.280> much<00:01:14.400> as<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.640> got

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
get that one to say as much as you got

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.570 
get that one to say as much as you got
to<00:01:14.880> work<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.180> get<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.509> Scorpion<00:01:16.049> or<00:01:16.140> any<00:01:16.290> other

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
to work to get the Scorpion or any other

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.830 
to work to get the Scorpion or any other
SMG<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:17.759> it's<00:01:18.030> one<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.479> get<00:01:18.630> rather

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
SMG so it's one that you get rather

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.630 
SMG so it's one that you get rather
quickly<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.619> before<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:20.130> spaccio<00:01:20.430> is

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
quickly and before it spaccio is

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.590 
quickly and before it spaccio is
actually<00:01:20.939> one<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.240> most<00:01:21.390> useful

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
actually one of the most useful

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.899 
actually one of the most useful
submachine<00:01:22.259> gun<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.799> really<00:01:23.369> was<00:01:23.610> one<00:01:23.820> of

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
submachine gun so it really was one of

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.370 
submachine gun so it really was one of
those<00:01:24.000> really<00:01:24.390> good<00:01:24.689> submachine<00:01:25.140> guns<00:01:25.290> that

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
those really good submachine guns that

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.830 
those really good submachine guns that
you<00:01:25.470> would<00:01:25.590> get<00:01:25.740> rather<00:01:26.070> early<00:01:26.460> on<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.360> MSMC

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
you would get rather early on the MSMC

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.130 
you would get rather early on the MSMC
is<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.259> fully<00:01:28.680> automatic<00:01:29.540> submachine<00:01:30.540> gun<00:01:30.720> just

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
is a fully automatic submachine gun just

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.260 
is a fully automatic submachine gun just
like<00:01:31.229> most<00:01:31.590> SMGs<00:01:32.490> really<00:01:32.759> are<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.060> only

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
like most SMGs really are the only

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.550 
like most SMGs really are the only
different<00:01:33.750> one<00:01:33.869> in<00:01:34.020> this<00:01:34.140> one<00:01:34.320> being<00:01:34.500> the

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
different one in this one being the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.760 
different one in this one being the
ChiCom<00:01:35.070> which<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.820> first<00:01:36.390> style<00:01:36.990> SMG<00:01:37.650> which

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
ChiCom which is a first style SMG which

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.109 
ChiCom which is a first style SMG which
is<00:01:37.890> something<00:01:38.040> we<00:01:38.189> haven't<00:01:38.369> seen<00:01:38.490> before<00:01:38.610> but

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
is something we haven't seen before but

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.420 
is something we haven't seen before but
just<00:01:39.600> so<00:01:39.720> we<00:01:39.780> know<00:01:39.810> it's<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.320> full<00:01:40.500> auto<00:01:40.680> msmc

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
just so we know it's a full auto msmc

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.039 
just so we know it's a full auto msmc
just<00:01:41.729> hold<00:01:41.880> on<00:01:42.000> on<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.180> trigger<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.720> if<00:01:42.960> you

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.940 
want to you can burst fire for more
control<00:01:44.700> when<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:44.880> comes<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.210> recoil<00:01:45.600> but<00:01:46.350> you

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
control when it comes to recoil but you

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.380 
control when it comes to recoil but you
know<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.250> know<00:01:47.340> if<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.549> just<00:01:47.759> want<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.060> you

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
know you know if you just want to you

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.940 
know you know if you just want to you
know<00:01:48.420> do<00:01:48.689> as<00:01:48.810> much<00:01:48.960> damage<00:01:48.990> as<00:01:49.380> possible<00:01:49.470> you

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
know do as much damage as possible you

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.560 
know do as much damage as possible you
just<00:01:49.979> hold<00:01:50.310> down<00:01:50.399> on<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.640> trigger<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.360> full

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
just hold down on the trigger it is full

extended clips on this thing it actually

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.399 
extended clips on this thing it actually
jumps<00:01:59.610> up<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.790> 40<00:02:00.299> it's<00:02:00.540> pretty<00:02:00.810> average<00:02:01.020> for

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
jumps up the 40 it's pretty average for

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.969 
jumps up the 40 it's pretty average for
smgs<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.880> is<00:02:03.210> actually<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.110> SMG<00:02:04.680> with<00:02:04.860> the

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
smgs it is actually the SMG with the

least amount of ammo starting off which

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.930 
least amount of ammo starting off which
is<00:02:07.469> a<00:02:07.619> little<00:02:07.770> bit<00:02:07.920> strange<00:02:08.190> but<00:02:08.399> I<00:02:08.580> guess<00:02:08.759> they

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
is a little bit strange but I guess they

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.460 
is a little bit strange but I guess they
wanted<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.270> balance<00:02:09.629> on<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:09.959> making<00:02:10.200> making

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
wanted to balance on and making making

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.320 
wanted to balance on and making making
sure<00:02:10.770> that<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:11.069> was

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
sure that it was

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.910 
sure that it was
submachine<00:02:11.600> gun<00:02:11.900> that<00:02:12.050> you<00:02:12.110> didn't<00:02:12.470> use<00:02:12.650> too

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
submachine gun that you didn't use too

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.920 
submachine gun that you didn't use too
heavily<00:02:13.250> and<00:02:13.550> I<00:02:14.150> guess<00:02:14.330> I<00:02:14.480> applaud<00:02:14.720> them<00:02:14.870> for

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
heavily and I guess I applaud them for

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.290 
heavily and I guess I applaud them for
that<00:02:15.140> trying<00:02:15.380> to<00:02:15.440> make<00:02:15.530> it<00:02:15.650> more<00:02:15.740> balanced<00:02:16.300> the

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
that trying to make it more balanced the

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.410 
that trying to make it more balanced the
MSMC<00:02:17.780> does<00:02:18.350> 40<00:02:18.920> damage<00:02:19.190> up<00:02:19.490> close<00:02:19.850> and<00:02:20.180> drops

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
MSMC does 40 damage up close and drops

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.990 
MSMC does 40 damage up close and drops
all<00:02:20.630> the<00:02:20.660> way<00:02:20.810> down<00:02:20.990> to<00:02:21.020> 18<00:02:21.500> again<00:02:22.010> all<00:02:22.250> smgs<00:02:22.820> in

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
all the way down to 18 again all smgs in

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.790 
all the way down to 18 again all smgs in
black<00:02:23.180> ops<00:02:23.330> 2<00:02:23.450> have<00:02:23.810> the<00:02:23.990> same<00:02:24.230> minimum<00:02:24.500> damage

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
black ops 2 have the same minimum damage

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.030 
black ops 2 have the same minimum damage
but<00:02:25.460> it<00:02:25.490> is<00:02:25.640> actually<00:02:25.820> the<00:02:26.270> most<00:02:26.540> damaging<00:02:27.320> SMG

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
but it is actually the most damaging SMG

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.760 
but it is actually the most damaging SMG
in<00:02:28.280> black<00:02:28.700> ops<00:02:28.910> 2<00:02:29.060> doing<00:02:29.450> 40<00:02:29.870> damage<00:02:30.140> up<00:02:30.440> close

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
in black ops 2 doing 40 damage up close

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.900 
in black ops 2 doing 40 damage up close
so<00:02:31.280> it<00:02:31.580> doesn't<00:02:32.540> st.<00:02:32.840> damage<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:34.130> MSMC<00:02:34.490> shoots

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
so it doesn't st. damage the MSMC shoots

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.760 
so it doesn't st. damage the MSMC shoots
at<00:02:35.090> seven<00:02:35.450> hundred<00:02:35.720> and<00:02:35.810> twenty<00:02:36.260> rounds<00:02:36.440> per

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
of how slow it shoots but again because

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.520 
of how slow it shoots but again because
there's<00:02:44.150> so<00:02:44.240> much<00:02:44.360> damage<00:02:44.660> they<00:02:44.960> had<00:02:45.200> to<00:02:45.350> kind

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
there's so much damage they had to kind

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.930 
there's so much damage they had to kind
of<00:02:45.620> balance<00:02:45.800> it<00:02:46.070> out<00:02:46.160> with<00:02:46.220> it<00:02:46.490> having<00:02:46.670> a

the<00:02:48.980> MSMC<00:02:49.370> has<00:02:49.700> a<00:02:49.730> time<00:02:50.060> to<00:02:50.240> kill<00:02:50.390> of<00:02:50.660> point<00:02:51.050> 18

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
the MSMC has a time to kill of point 18

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.970 
the MSMC has a time to kill of point 18
35<00:02:51.980> 20<00:02:52.610> point<00:02:52.880> for<00:02:53.150> 338<00:02:53.870> it's<00:02:54.620> actually<00:02:54.890> pretty

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
35 20 point for 338 it's actually pretty

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.640 
35 20 point for 338 it's actually pretty
funny<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.459> same<00:02:55.760> shot<00:02:56.240> time<00:02:56.870> to<00:02:57.020> kill<00:02:57.230> as<00:02:57.440> the

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
funny the same shot time to kill as the

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.500 
funny the same shot time to kill as the
PDW<00:02:58.310> so<00:02:58.490> I<00:02:58.520> guess<00:02:58.760> they<00:02:58.910> kind<00:02:59.030> of<00:02:59.120> married<00:02:59.420> the

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
PDW so I guess they kind of married the

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.840 
PDW so I guess they kind of married the
two<00:02:59.660> together<00:02:59.870> it's<00:03:00.800> pretty<00:03:01.040> decent<00:03:01.280> it<00:03:01.730> has

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
two together it's pretty decent it has

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.640 
two together it's pretty decent it has
the<00:03:02.060> same<00:03:02.330> kind<00:03:02.540> of<00:03:02.720> really<00:03:02.990> fast<00:03:03.260> killing

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
the same kind of really fast killing

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.470 
the same kind of really fast killing
speed<00:03:03.920> as<00:03:04.070> you<00:03:04.550> would<00:03:04.670> see<00:03:04.820> with<00:03:04.910> the<00:03:05.030> chicom

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
speed as you would see with the chicom

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.990 
speed as you would see with the chicom
so<00:03:05.930> it's<00:03:06.680> definitely<00:03:07.130> a<00:03:07.250> little<00:03:07.550> bit<00:03:07.760> faster

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
so it's definitely a little bit faster

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.480 
so it's definitely a little bit faster
than<00:03:08.270> most<00:03:08.540> of<00:03:08.990> the<00:03:09.020> SMGs<00:03:09.620> definitely<00:03:10.190> not<00:03:10.370> the

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
than most of the SMGs definitely not the

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.010 
than most of the SMGs definitely not the
fastest<00:03:10.880> still<00:03:11.060> the<00:03:11.180> fastest<00:03:11.540> one<00:03:11.690> being<00:03:11.930> the

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
fastest still the fastest one being the

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.770 
fastest still the fastest one being the
Scorpion<00:03:12.620> the<00:03:13.250> PDW<00:03:13.850> actually<00:03:14.270> has<00:03:14.390> a<00:03:14.420> three

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
Scorpion the PDW actually has a three

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.120 
Scorpion the PDW actually has a three
shot<00:03:14.959> kill<00:03:15.230> range<00:03:15.440> which<00:03:15.680> is<00:03:15.800> something<00:03:16.010> that

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
shot kill range which is something that

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.940 
shot kill range which is something that
not<00:03:16.430> a<00:03:16.459> lot<00:03:16.970> of<00:03:17.150> the<00:03:17.300> other<00:03:17.450> SMGs<00:03:17.989> have<00:03:18.200> it<00:03:18.410> has

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
not a lot of the other SMGs have it has

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.729 
not a lot of the other SMGs have it has
a<00:03:18.980> three<00:03:19.760> shot<00:03:19.910> kill<00:03:20.150> range<00:03:20.360> of<00:03:20.540> 44<00:03:21.170> feet<00:03:21.500> or

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
a three shot kill range of 44 feet or

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.850 
a three shot kill range of 44 feet or
about<00:03:22.160> 13<00:03:22.700> meters<00:03:23.090> so<00:03:23.930> it<00:03:24.200> does<00:03:24.380> actually<00:03:24.560> have

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
about 13 meters so it does actually have

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.140 
about 13 meters so it does actually have
a<00:03:24.890> three<00:03:25.100> shot<00:03:25.250> kill<00:03:25.459> range<00:03:25.610> is<00:03:25.820> something

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
a three shot kill range is something

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.270 
a three shot kill range is something
that<00:03:26.209> you<00:03:26.330> don't<00:03:26.510> really<00:03:26.630> see<00:03:26.989> with<00:03:27.200> SMGs<00:03:27.800> in

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
that you don't really see with SMGs in

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.160 
that you don't really see with SMGs in
black<00:03:28.550> ops<00:03:28.730> 2<00:03:28.880> so<00:03:29.239> that's<00:03:29.690> always<00:03:29.870> a<00:03:29.989> nice

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
black ops 2 so that's always a nice

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.500 
black ops 2 so that's always a nice
thing<00:03:30.459> because<00:03:31.459> of<00:03:31.610> the<00:03:31.730> amount<00:03:32.120> of<00:03:32.269> damage

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
thing because of the amount of damage

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.479 
thing because of the amount of damage
and<00:03:32.600> it<00:03:32.720> doesn't<00:03:33.019> do<00:03:33.230> the<00:03:33.470> steep<00:03:33.709> drop-off<00:03:34.220> the

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
and it doesn't do the steep drop-off the

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.030 
and it doesn't do the steep drop-off the
MSMC<00:03:35.180> is<00:03:35.390> actually<00:03:35.810> a<00:03:35.840> three<00:03:36.260> to<00:03:36.470> six<00:03:36.739> shot

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
MSMC is actually a three to six shot

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.490 
MSMC is actually a three to six shot
kill<00:03:37.310> weapon<00:03:37.760> so<00:03:38.239> I<00:03:38.750> would<00:03:39.080> just<00:03:39.230> highly

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
kill weapon so I would just highly

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.020 
kill weapon so I would just highly
advise<00:03:39.739> not<00:03:39.769> to<00:03:40.040> try<00:03:40.280> to<00:03:40.340> kill<00:03:40.519> anyone<00:03:40.760> who's

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
advise not to try to kill anyone who's

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.120 
advise not to try to kill anyone who's
at<00:03:41.180> a<00:03:41.209> distance<00:03:41.690> just<00:03:41.900> stick<00:03:42.140> close<00:03:42.170> take<00:03:42.980> them

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
at a distance just stick close take them

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.229 
at a distance just stick close take them
out<00:03:43.250> and<00:03:43.280> you'll<00:03:43.489> be<00:03:43.610> destroying<00:03:43.940> people

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
out and you'll be destroying people

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.350 
out and you'll be destroying people
rather<00:03:44.420> quickly<00:03:44.810> the<00:03:45.709> MSMC<00:03:46.190> has<00:03:46.519> a<00:03:46.550> 1.1

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
rather quickly the MSMC has a 1.1

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.509 
rather quickly the MSMC has a 1.1
headshot<00:03:47.810> multiplier<00:03:47.959> so<00:03:48.830> it<00:03:48.950> does<00:03:49.220> kind<00:03:49.489> of

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
headshot multiplier so it does kind of

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:50.890 
headshot multiplier so it does kind of
help<00:03:49.670> out<00:03:49.790> a<00:03:49.820> little<00:03:49.970> bit<00:03:50.209> but<00:03:50.390> I<00:03:50.420> would<00:03:50.660> say

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
help out a little bit but I would say

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.210 
help out a little bit but I would say
that<00:03:50.930> if<00:03:51.200> you<00:03:51.230> really<00:03:51.709> want<00:03:51.890> to<00:03:51.950> stay<00:03:52.190> on

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
that if you really want to stay on

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.340 
that if you really want to stay on
target<00:03:52.820> you<00:03:53.060> don't<00:03:53.300> want<00:03:53.450> to<00:03:53.510> miss<00:03:53.690> I<00:03:53.900> would

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
target you don't want to miss I would

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.560 
target you don't want to miss I would
not<00:03:54.620> go<00:03:54.650> for<00:03:55.010> a<00:03:55.070> head<00:03:55.220> shot<00:03:55.250> if<00:03:56.030> you<00:03:56.090> want<00:03:56.420> to

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
not go for a head shot if you want to

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.030 
not go for a head shot if you want to
you<00:03:56.660> can<00:03:56.870> do<00:03:57.110> it<00:03:57.230> you<00:03:57.320> might<00:03:57.350> be<00:03:57.620> able<00:03:57.709> to<00:03:57.860> cut

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
you can do it you might be able to cut

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.890 
you can do it you might be able to cut
down<00:03:58.250> that<00:03:58.489> six<00:03:58.940> shot<00:03:59.120> kill<00:03:59.330> range<00:03:59.540> down<00:03:59.690> to<00:03:59.870> a

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
down that six shot kill range down to a

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.479 
down that six shot kill range down to a
five<00:04:00.170> I<00:04:00.200> would<00:04:00.530> say<00:04:00.709> only<00:04:00.920> go<00:04:01.130> for<00:04:01.340> headshots

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
five I would say only go for headshots

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.040 
five I would say only go for headshots
if<00:04:01.790> you're<00:04:01.940> confident<00:04:02.300> at<00:04:02.480> getting<00:04:02.780> someone

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
if you're confident at getting someone

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.140 
if you're confident at getting someone
at<00:04:03.140> a<00:04:03.170> distance<00:04:03.620> if<00:04:03.769> not<00:04:03.980> I<00:04:04.010> would<00:04:04.340> just<00:04:04.519> stick

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
at a distance if not I would just stick

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.940 
at a distance if not I would just stick
to<00:04:05.300> not<00:04:05.480> getting<00:04:05.690> headshots<00:04:05.959> since<00:04:06.500> it<00:04:06.709> really

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
to not getting headshots since it really

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.949 
to not getting headshots since it really
is<00:04:07.070> not<00:04:07.370> much<00:04:07.430> of<00:04:07.760> a<00:04:07.850> reward<00:04:08.000> from<00:04:08.450> doing<00:04:08.810> it

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
is not much of a reward from doing it

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:12.729 
is not much of a reward from doing it
the<00:04:09.950> MSMC<00:04:10.430> actually<00:04:11.150> has<00:04:11.360> a<00:04:11.390> medium<00:04:11.959> of<00:04:12.140> hip

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
the MSMC actually has a medium of hip

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.800 
the MSMC actually has a medium of hip
spread<00:04:13.040> now<00:04:13.220> it<00:04:13.370> used<00:04:13.400> to<00:04:13.640> have<00:04:13.760> very<00:04:14.030> low<00:04:14.299> but

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
spread now it used to have very low but

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.479 
spread now it used to have very low but
due<00:04:14.930> to<00:04:14.959> the<00:04:15.170> recent<00:04:15.320> patch<00:04:15.680> you<00:04:15.860> decided<00:04:16.310> that

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
due to the recent patch you decided that

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.250 
due to the recent patch you decided that
they<00:04:17.090> wanted<00:04:17.390> to<00:04:17.450> kind<00:04:17.660> of<00:04:17.720> nerf<00:04:17.900> it<00:04:18.080> a<00:04:18.140> little

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
they wanted to kind of nerf it a little

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.770 
they wanted to kind of nerf it a little
bit<00:04:18.470> on

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
bit on

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.680 
bit on
the<00:04:18.900> MSMC<00:04:19.320> has<00:04:19.680> medium<00:04:19.980> hip<00:04:20.579> spray<00:04:20.910> which<00:04:21.570> is

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
the MSMC has medium hip spray which is

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.660 
the MSMC has medium hip spray which is
kind<00:04:21.870> of<00:04:21.930> sad<00:04:21.989> because<00:04:22.320> the<00:04:22.500> PDW<00:04:23.010> was<00:04:23.130> a<00:04:23.160> really

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
kind of sad because the PDW was a really

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.480 
kind of sad because the PDW was a really
really<00:04:23.820> powerful<00:04:24.200> SMG<00:04:25.200> along<00:04:25.470> with<00:04:25.650> the<00:04:25.830> PDW

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
really powerful SMG along with the PDW

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.760 
really powerful SMG along with the PDW
and<00:04:26.670> most<00:04:27.240> of<00:04:27.419> the<00:04:27.510> other<00:04:27.690> SMG<00:04:28.230> so<00:04:28.380> it's<00:04:28.590> kind

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
and most of the other SMG so it's kind

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:29.870 
and most of the other SMG so it's kind
of<00:04:28.830> said<00:04:29.040> that<00:04:29.160> they<00:04:29.250> would<00:04:29.370> change<00:04:29.580> the<00:04:29.730> hip

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
of said that they would change the hip

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.820 
of said that they would change the hip
spray<00:04:30.150> but<00:04:30.330> I<00:04:30.360> guess<00:04:30.600> they<00:04:30.810> desided<00:04:31.620> tweaked

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
spray but I guess they desided tweaked

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
spray but I guess they desided tweaked
it<00:04:31.950> a<00:04:31.980> little<00:04:32.010> bit<00:04:32.250> too<00:04:32.370> many<00:04:32.550> people<00:04:32.760> were

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
it a little bit too many people were

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.850 
it a little bit too many people were
using<00:04:33.000> it<00:04:33.240> I<00:04:33.300> guess<00:04:33.480> that's<00:04:33.750> kind<00:04:33.960> of<00:04:34.020> sad<00:04:34.230> that

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
using it I guess that's kind of sad that

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.820 
using it I guess that's kind of sad that
moving<00:04:35.190> forward<00:04:35.669> from<00:04:35.700> that<00:04:35.850> the<00:04:36.150> MSMC<00:04:36.600> has<00:04:37.290> a

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
moving forward from that the MSMC has a

moving forward from that the MSMC has a

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
movement speed of one hundred percent

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.900 
movement speed of one hundred percent
it's<00:04:39.960> an<00:04:40.080> SMG<00:04:40.380> basically<00:04:41.280> just<00:04:41.460> just<00:04:41.700> means

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
it's an SMG basically just just means

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.610 
it's an SMG basically just just means
that<00:04:42.060> you<00:04:42.210> don't<00:04:42.300> have<00:04:42.419> to<00:04:42.630> worry<00:04:42.840> about<00:04:43.290> being

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
that you don't have to worry about being

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:44.870 
that you don't have to worry about being

walking around in one hundred percent

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.250 
walking around in one hundred percent
speed<00:04:50.220> then<00:04:50.700> you<00:04:51.060> actually<00:04:51.300> appear<00:04:51.900> on<00:04:52.080> the

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260

mini-map<00:04:52.710> you<00:04:53.070> guys<00:04:53.160> want<00:04:53.340> to<00:04:53.400> learn<00:04:53.460> more

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
mini-map you guys want to learn more

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:54.890 
mini-map you guys want to learn more
about<00:04:53.730> that<00:04:54.090> you<00:04:54.240> guys<00:04:54.330> can<00:04:54.510> check<00:04:54.630> it<00:04:54.780> out<00:04:54.840> on

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
about that you guys can check it out on

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.560 
about that you guys can check it out on
my<00:04:55.110> other<00:04:55.260> dissections<00:04:56.010> of<00:04:56.130> the<00:04:56.669> of<00:04:57.180> the<00:04:57.330> ghost

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
my other dissections of the of the ghost

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.400 
my other dissections of the of the ghost
perk<00:04:57.870> the<00:04:58.560> MSMC<00:04:58.980> has<00:04:59.250> a<00:04:59.280> knife<00:04:59.550> speed<00:04:59.880> of<00:05:00.410> 1.12

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
perk the MSMC has a knife speed of 1.12

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.460 
perk the MSMC has a knife speed of 1.12
so<00:05:02.040> it's<00:05:02.700> actually<00:05:02.850> pretty<00:05:03.180> average<00:05:03.510> for<00:05:03.960> SMGs

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
so it's actually pretty average for SMGs

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.590 
so it's actually pretty average for SMGs
it's<00:05:04.620> a<00:05:04.680> little<00:05:05.040> bit<00:05:05.130> faster<00:05:05.610> than<00:05:05.880> and<00:05:06.090> a

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
it's a little bit faster than and a

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.640 
it's a little bit faster than and a
little<00:05:06.810> bit<00:05:06.900> of<00:05:06.930> the<00:05:07.020> other<00:05:07.140> ones<00:05:07.350> but<00:05:07.440> again

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
little bit of the other ones but again

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:08.930 
little bit of the other ones but again
there's<00:05:07.800> not<00:05:07.919> much<00:05:08.070> of<00:05:08.190> a<00:05:08.250> difference<00:05:08.669> it'd<00:05:08.790> be

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
there's not much of a difference it'd be

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.300 
there's not much of a difference it'd be
more<00:05:09.120> like<00:05:09.180> a<00:05:09.330> point<00:05:09.750> to<00:05:09.990> of<00:05:10.229> a<00:05:10.650> difference<00:05:11.130> so

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
more like a point to of a difference so

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.680 
more like a point to of a difference so
it's<00:05:11.460> not<00:05:11.520> really<00:05:11.580> a<00:05:11.820> lot<00:05:12.030> it's<00:05:12.240> definitely

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
it's not really a lot it's definitely

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.110 
it's not really a lot it's definitely
faster<00:05:12.990> than<00:05:13.320> assault<00:05:13.650> rifles<00:05:14.100> and<00:05:14.430> and

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
faster than assault rifles and and

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.760 
faster than assault rifles and and
snipers<00:05:15.630> and<00:05:15.660> stuff<00:05:15.930> like<00:05:16.050> that<00:05:16.110> but<00:05:16.410> nothing

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
snipers and stuff like that but nothing

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.830 
snipers and stuff like that but nothing
really<00:05:16.860> impressive<00:05:17.340> here<00:05:17.520> 1.12<00:05:18.360> you<00:05:18.690> would

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
really impressive here 1.12 you would

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.800 
really impressive here 1.12 you would
expect<00:05:19.110> that<00:05:19.320> with<00:05:19.500> an<00:05:19.680> SMG<00:05:20.130> the<00:05:21.090> MSMC<00:05:21.510> has<00:05:21.780> a

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
expect that with an SMG the MSMC has a

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.500 
expect that with an SMG the MSMC has a
80s<00:05:22.290> in<00:05:22.530> and<00:05:22.740> 80s<00:05:23.100> out<00:05:23.310> of<00:05:23.520> point<00:05:23.850> two<00:05:24.030> two<00:05:24.240> and

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
80s in and 80s out of point two two and

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.900 
80s in and 80s out of point two two and
point<00:05:24.870> to<00:05:25.110> again<00:05:25.830> average<00:05:26.250> numbers<00:05:26.610> for<00:05:26.850> an

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
point to again average numbers for an

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.409 
point to again average numbers for an
SMG<00:05:27.270> the<00:05:28.200> MSMC<00:05:28.530> also<00:05:28.950> has<00:05:29.130> a<00:05:29.490> raised<00:05:29.880> time<00:05:30.210> of<00:05:30.390> 0

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 
SMG the MSMC also has a raised time of 0

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:33.380 
SMG the MSMC also has a raised time of 0
point<00:05:30.660> six<00:05:30.930> to<00:05:31.169> any<00:05:31.770> drop<00:05:32.070> time<00:05:32.370> of<00:05:32.640> point<00:05:32.940> 32

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:33.390 
point six to any drop time of point 32

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.029 
point six to any drop time of point 32
so<00:05:33.810> it<00:05:33.960> is<00:05:33.990> this<00:05:34.289> is<00:05:34.410> a<00:05:34.440> little<00:05:34.710> bit<00:05:34.800> weird

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 
so it is this is a little bit weird

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:36.740 
so it is this is a little bit weird
because<00:05:35.220> it<00:05:35.490> has<00:05:35.640> a<00:05:35.669> little<00:05:36.030> bit<00:05:36.210> of<00:05:36.240> a<00:05:36.390> slower

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
because it has a little bit of a slower

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.170 
because it has a little bit of a slower
raised<00:05:37.289> time<00:05:37.710> but<00:05:38.160> it<00:05:38.250> has<00:05:38.370> a<00:05:38.400> faster<00:05:38.910> drop

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
raised time but it has a faster drop

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.120 
raised time but it has a faster drop
time<00:05:39.450> than<00:05:39.630> than<00:05:40.140> some<00:05:40.350> of<00:05:40.410> the<00:05:40.500> other<00:05:40.590> SMG<00:05:41.070> is

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
time than than some of the other SMG is

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.290 
time than than some of the other SMG is
not<00:05:41.280> much<00:05:41.400> of<00:05:41.520> a<00:05:41.580> difference<00:05:41.910> but<00:05:41.970> it's<00:05:42.150> really

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
not much of a difference but it's really

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.940 
not much of a difference but it's really
interesting<00:05:42.600> to<00:05:42.780> see<00:05:43.020> that<00:05:43.050> that<00:05:43.680> it<00:05:43.770> actually

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:43.950 
interesting to see that that it actually

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:45.710 
interesting to see that that it actually
takes<00:05:44.430> longer<00:05:44.700> to<00:05:44.789> raise<00:05:44.970> but<00:05:45.210> it's<00:05:45.330> faster

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 
takes longer to raise but it's faster

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.120 
takes longer to raise but it's faster
dropping<00:05:46.169> than<00:05:46.289> some<00:05:46.440> of<00:05:46.530> the<00:05:46.590> other<00:05:46.710> weapons

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
dropping than some of the other weapons

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.909 
dropping than some of the other weapons
so<00:05:47.280> I<00:05:47.310> guess<00:05:47.490> again<00:05:48.030> balancing<00:05:48.830> moving<00:05:49.830> on

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 
so I guess again balancing moving on

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:52.909 
so I guess again balancing moving on
from<00:05:50.039> there<00:05:50.220> the<00:05:50.340> MSMC<00:05:50.870> has<00:05:51.870> a<00:05:51.900> reload<00:05:52.410> time<00:05:52.650> of

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 
from there the MSMC has a reload time of

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:55.969 
from there the MSMC has a reload time of
2.07<00:05:53.700> seconds<00:05:54.570> and<00:05:54.720> if<00:05:55.140> you<00:05:55.229> do<00:05:55.410> a<00:05:55.440> reload

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979 
2.07 seconds and if you do a reload

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:58.279 
2.07 seconds and if you do a reload
cancel<00:05:56.520> as<00:05:56.789> in<00:05:57.150> running<00:05:57.630> forward<00:05:58.169> while

00:05:58.279 --> 00:05:58.289 
cancel as in running forward while

00:05:58.289 --> 00:05:59.840 
cancel as in running forward while
you're<00:05:58.410> reloading<00:05:58.560> or<00:05:59.100> just<00:05:59.520> kind<00:05:59.700> of<00:05:59.729> doing

00:05:59.840 --> 00:05:59.850 
you're reloading or just kind of doing

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.760 
you're reloading or just kind of doing
the<00:05:59.970> why<00:06:00.120> why<00:06:00.300> cancel<00:06:00.780> it<00:06:01.080> would<00:06:01.229> drop<00:06:01.410> down<00:06:01.470> to

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
the why why cancel it would drop down to

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.460 
the why why cancel it would drop down to
one<00:06:01.979> point<00:06:02.220> seven<00:06:02.550> two<00:06:02.880> seconds<00:06:03.479> and<00:06:03.630> if<00:06:04.320> you

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470 
one point seven two seconds and if you

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.290 
one point seven two seconds and if you
go<00:06:04.710> completely<00:06:05.100> through<00:06:05.400> all<00:06:05.550> your<00:06:05.700> ammo<00:06:06.090> and

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
go completely through all your ammo and

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.070 
go completely through all your ammo and
you<00:06:06.360> have<00:06:06.479> to<00:06:06.600> go<00:06:06.690> through<00:06:06.840> the<00:06:06.900> full

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
you have to go through the full

time and if you reload cancel it's

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.630 
time and if you reload cancel it's
actually<00:06:13.410> faster<00:06:13.710> than<00:06:13.979> if<00:06:14.220> you<00:06:14.340> were<00:06:14.460> to

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:14.640 
actually faster than if you were to

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:34.810 
you have to use the red dot sight but

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:36.659 
you have to use the red dot sight but
the<00:06:34.960> MSMC<00:06:35.320> has<00:06:35.650> really<00:06:35.949> clear<00:06:36.160> iron<00:06:36.340> sights

the MSMC has really clear iron sights
you<00:06:37.090> don't<00:06:37.360> have<00:06:37.509> to<00:06:37.630> waste<00:06:37.810> a<00:06:38.139> point<00:06:38.710> on

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:41.410 
getting a sight on this weapon the MSMC

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:44.340 
getting a sight on this weapon the MSMC
also<00:06:41.919> has<00:06:42.160> moderate<00:06:43.000> recoil<00:06:43.389> now<00:06:43.840> used<00:06:44.199> to

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:44.350 
also has moderate recoil now used to

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.890 
also has moderate recoil now used to
have<00:06:44.560> very<00:06:45.070> low<00:06:45.310> recoil<00:06:45.580> but<00:06:46.330> again<00:06:46.690> due<00:06:46.870> to

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:46.900 
have very low recoil but again due to

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.200 
have very low recoil but again due to
the<00:06:47.050> recent<00:06:47.320> pacha<00:06:47.740> decided<00:06:48.370> that<00:06:48.520> it<00:06:48.639> had<00:06:48.880> too

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:49.210 
the recent pacha decided that it had too

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:51.390 
the recent pacha decided that it had too
much<00:06:49.419> or<00:06:49.720> the<00:06:49.960> ricoh<00:06:50.440> was<00:06:50.620> too<00:06:50.770> low<00:06:50.949> so<00:06:51.220> they

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:51.400 
much or the ricoh was too low so they

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.760 
much or the ricoh was too low so they
decided<00:06:51.759> to<00:06:52.289> increase<00:06:53.289> the<00:06:53.530> amount<00:06:53.710> of

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:53.770 
decided to increase the amount of

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:55.050 
decided to increase the amount of
recalls<00:06:54.100> and<00:06:54.220> now<00:06:54.280> it<00:06:54.340> has<00:06:54.430> moderate<00:06:54.820> to

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:55.060 
recalls and now it has moderate to

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.909 
recalls and now it has moderate to
moderately<00:06:55.630> high<00:06:55.900> recoil<00:06:56.380> so<00:06:56.680> it's<00:06:56.830> actually

00:06:56.909 --> 00:06:56.919 
moderately high recoil so it's actually

00:06:56.919 --> 00:06:59.070 
moderately high recoil so it's actually
pretty<00:06:57.160> sad<00:06:57.400> to<00:06:57.490> see<00:06:57.639> that<00:06:57.669> but<00:06:58.000> again<00:06:58.180> try<00:06:58.930> are

00:06:59.070 --> 00:06:59.080 
pretty sad to see that but again try are

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.290 
pretty sad to see that but again try are
trying<00:06:59.320> to<00:06:59.410> balance<00:06:59.560> the<00:06:59.889> game<00:07:00.070> out<00:07:00.340> anyways

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:01.300 
trying to balance the game out anyways

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:02.430 
trying to balance the game out anyways
