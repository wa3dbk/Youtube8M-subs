00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
that I've been using recently so when I

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.569 
that I've been using recently so when I
first<00:00:36.870> started<00:00:36.989> out<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.530> wanted<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.190> see<00:00:38.340> if

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
first started out I wanted to see if

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.299 
first started out I wanted to see if
there<00:00:38.700> was<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.820> way<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.000> texturized<00:00:39.840> my<00:00:40.309> clay

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
there was a way of texturized my clay

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.760 
there was a way of texturized my clay
and<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:42.180> get<00:00:42.360> pretty<00:00:42.930> details<00:00:43.320> because<00:00:43.559> I'm

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
and to get pretty details because I'm

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.160 
and to get pretty details because I'm
not<00:00:43.890> I'm<00:00:44.100> naturally<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.610> sculptor<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.450> so<00:00:46.140> I

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
not I'm naturally a sculptor and so I

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.130 
not I'm naturally a sculptor and so I
wanted<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.590> make<00:00:46.739> my<00:00:46.860> clay<00:00:47.070> look<00:00:47.280> interesting

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
wanted to make my clay look interesting

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.540 
wanted to make my clay look interesting
so<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.170> was<00:00:49.410> looking<00:00:49.530> around<00:00:49.860> at<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.250> different

so I was looking around at the different
craft<00:00:50.730> stores<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.750> first<00:00:51.960> thing<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.230> came

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
craft stores and the first thing I came

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.189 
craft stores and the first thing I came
across<00:00:52.559> was<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.420> cuttlebug<00:00:54.480> now<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:54.960> don't

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
across was a cuttlebug now I don't

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.709 
across was a cuttlebug now I don't
actually<00:00:55.469> use<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:56.070> cuddle<00:00:56.340> bug<00:00:56.579> I'm<00:00:57.360> not<00:00:57.510> even

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
actually use a cuddle bug I'm not even

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.810 
actually use a cuddle bug I'm not even
quite<00:00:57.840> sure<00:00:58.140> what<00:00:58.350> they're<00:00:58.559> for<00:00:58.800> if<00:00:59.100> maybe<00:00:59.730> I

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
quite sure what they're for if maybe I

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.209 
quite sure what they're for if maybe I
read<00:01:00.149> about<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.480> but<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:01.530> bought<00:01:01.980> this

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
read about it but I bought this

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.979 
read about it but I bought this
container<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:03.000> had<00:01:03.180> four<00:01:03.570> different

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
container that had four different

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.250 
container that had four different
designs<00:01:04.100> in<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.570> this<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.720> just<00:01:06.900> one<00:01:07.140> of

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
designs in it and this is just one of

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.039 
designs in it and this is just one of
them<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.909> it's<00:01:08.909> kind<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.180> like<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.360> giant<00:01:09.750> stamp

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
them and it's kind of like a giant stamp

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.050 
them and it's kind of like a giant stamp
so<00:01:10.320> what<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.530> did<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.220> bought<00:01:11.400> some<00:01:11.610> clay<00:01:11.850> and

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
so what I did is I bought some clay and

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.149 
so what I did is I bought some clay and
then<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.390> just<00:01:12.570> go<00:01:12.750> ahead<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.439> I'd<00:01:13.680> like<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.950> use

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
then I just go ahead and I'd like to use

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.060 
then I just go ahead and I'd like to use
my<00:01:14.189> rolling<00:01:14.790> pin<00:01:15.350> we're<00:01:16.350> doing<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:16.920> can

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
my rolling pin we're doing this so I can

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.760 
my rolling pin we're doing this so I can
get<00:01:17.189> an<00:01:17.280> even<00:01:17.900> amount<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:19.110> pressure<00:01:19.350> on<00:01:19.560> there

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
get an even amount of pressure on there

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.560 
get an even amount of pressure on there
and<00:01:20.310> then<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.610> was<00:01:20.670> peeled<00:01:20.939> off<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.240> which<00:01:21.450> is

and then it was peeled off and which is

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.969 
and then it was peeled off and which is
nice<00:01:21.720> it's<00:01:21.900> plastic<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:22.439> I'm<00:01:22.619> gonna<00:01:22.710> have<00:01:22.860> to

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
nice it's plastic so I'm gonna have to

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.440

I'll show you

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.180 
I'll show you
stamp<00:02:09.610> works<00:02:10.360> most<00:02:11.050> people<00:02:11.350> stamp<00:02:11.920> works

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
stamp works most people stamp works

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.700 
stamp works most people stamp works

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
there it's the same exactly when you

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.920 
there it's the same exactly when you
move<00:02:14.860> your<00:02:14.950> paper<00:02:15.250> you<00:02:15.790> just<00:02:16.000> take<00:02:16.210> it<00:02:16.420> put<00:02:16.810> it

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
down press in and see and then I have a

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.060 
down press in and see and then I have a
real<00:02:19.810> pretty<00:02:19.960> butterfly<00:02:20.410> and<00:02:20.620> then<00:02:20.710> I<00:02:20.800> can<00:02:20.980> go

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
real pretty butterfly and then I can go

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.890 
real pretty butterfly and then I can go
ahead<00:02:21.190> and<00:02:21.430> with<00:02:21.520> some<00:02:21.670> tools<00:02:21.880> and<00:02:22.300> cut<00:02:22.750> that

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
in different areas so that night there's

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.390 
in different areas so that night there's
butterflies<00:02:27.600> so<00:02:28.650> another<00:02:29.650> thing<00:02:29.740> that<00:02:30.190> I

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
butterflies so another thing that I

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.750 
butterflies so another thing that I
found<00:02:30.700> that<00:02:30.940> was<00:02:31.090> much<00:02:31.450> cheaper<00:02:31.780> and<00:02:32.460> I<00:02:33.460> liked

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
found that was much cheaper and I liked

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.670 
found that was much cheaper and I liked
it<00:02:33.970> and<00:02:34.150> they<00:02:34.240> were<00:02:34.300> more<00:02:34.510> flexible<00:02:34.720> then

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
it and they were more flexible then

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.070 
it and they were more flexible then
using<00:02:36.070> a<00:02:36.130> stamp<00:02:36.430> or<00:02:36.760> you<00:02:37.330> do<00:02:37.480> this

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
using a stamp or you do this

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.640 
using a stamp or you do this
I<00:02:38.110> found<00:02:39.100> something<00:02:39.310> cheaper<00:02:40.230> these<00:02:41.230> you<00:02:41.500> can

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
I found something cheaper these you can

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.060 
I found something cheaper these you can
get<00:02:41.770> over<00:02:42.160> in<00:02:42.370> the<00:02:42.730> stamp<00:02:43.510> area<00:02:43.900> too<00:02:44.140> and<00:02:44.440> they

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
get over in the stamp area too and they

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.210 
get over in the stamp area too and they
look<00:02:45.250> like<00:02:45.280> this<00:02:45.640> and<00:02:45.910> they<00:02:46.209> come<00:02:47.010> you<00:02:48.010> come

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
look like this and they come you come

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.130 
look like this and they come you come
like<00:02:48.459> an<00:02:48.580> attack<00:02:48.910> like<00:02:49.600> this<00:02:49.750> one<00:02:49.930> here<00:02:50.110> I

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
like an attack like this one here I

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.320 
like an attack like this one here I
haven't<00:02:50.530> even<00:02:50.590> used<00:02:50.950> yet<00:02:51.220> and<00:02:51.370> we<00:02:51.940> have<00:02:52.120> like<00:02:52.300> a

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
haven't even used yet and we have like a

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.600 
haven't even used yet and we have like a
C<00:02:53.320> they<00:02:53.530> have<00:02:53.560> this<00:02:53.830> little<00:02:53.950> plastic<00:02:54.250> that

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
C they have this little plastic that

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.360 
C they have this little plastic that
seals<00:02:54.880> it<00:02:55.060> and<00:02:55.270> they<00:02:56.170> cut<00:02:56.410> and<00:02:56.770> I<00:02:56.890> took<00:02:57.280> this

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
seals it and they cut and I took this

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:58.800 
seals it and they cut and I took this
whole<00:02:57.580> plastic<00:02:57.940> off<00:02:58.030> and<00:02:58.150> then<00:02:58.300> it's<00:02:58.450> a<00:02:58.540> stamp

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
whole plastic off and then it's a stamp

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.870 
whole plastic off and then it's a stamp
on<00:02:58.990> the<00:02:59.080> other<00:02:59.200> side<00:02:59.470> I<00:02:59.740> keep<00:03:00.190> them<00:03:00.310> on<00:03:00.640> there

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
on the other side I keep them on there

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.050 
on the other side I keep them on there
if<00:03:00.970> I'm<00:03:01.060> not<00:03:01.209> using<00:03:01.480> them<00:03:02.520> but<00:03:03.520> these<00:03:04.000> are

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
if I'm not using them but these are

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.660 
if I'm not using them but these are
really<00:03:04.420> nice<00:03:04.660> because<00:03:05.500> they're<00:03:06.100> flexible

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
really nice because they're flexible

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.820 
really nice because they're flexible
unlike<00:03:07.540> a<00:03:07.570> stamp<00:03:07.930> you'd<00:03:08.170> have<00:03:08.290> to<00:03:08.440> pull<00:03:08.650> this

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
unlike a stamp you'd have to pull this

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.710 
unlike a stamp you'd have to pull this
off<00:03:09.070> to<00:03:09.280> make<00:03:09.430> it<00:03:09.459> more<00:03:09.760> flexible<00:03:09.940> but<00:03:10.480> some

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
off to make it more flexible but some

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.259 
off to make it more flexible but some
people<00:03:10.990> like<00:03:11.110> to<00:03:11.140> have<00:03:11.410> this<00:03:11.850> handle<00:03:12.850> but<00:03:13.150> this

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
people like to have this handle but this

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.110 
people like to have this handle but this
may<00:03:13.540> allows<00:03:13.930> me<00:03:14.170> to<00:03:14.350> be<00:03:14.440> able<00:03:14.530> to<00:03:14.709> do<00:03:14.890> more<00:03:15.130> get

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
may allows me to be able to do more get

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.479 
may allows me to be able to do more get
around<00:03:16.300> the<00:03:16.420> clay<00:03:16.769> maybe<00:03:17.769> like<00:03:18.130> you<00:03:18.220> can<00:03:18.370> add<00:03:18.459> a

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
around the clay maybe like you can add a

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.880 
around the clay maybe like you can add a
corner<00:03:19.030> this<00:03:19.600> won't<00:03:19.900> do<00:03:20.110> very<00:03:20.140> well<00:03:20.590> but<00:03:20.739> maybe

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
corner this won't do very well but maybe

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.090 
corner this won't do very well but maybe
you<00:03:21.040> wanted<00:03:21.280> to<00:03:21.340> wrap<00:03:21.670> it<00:03:21.850> you<00:03:22.420> can<00:03:22.600> bend<00:03:22.870> it

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
you wanted to wrap it you can bend it

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.470 
you wanted to wrap it you can bend it
like<00:03:24.100> that<00:03:24.250> and<00:03:24.640> I<00:03:24.820> even<00:03:24.970> have<00:03:25.239> them<00:03:25.390> in

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
like that and I even have them in

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.449 
like that and I even have them in
different<00:03:25.660> sizes<00:03:28.800> like<00:03:29.800> I<00:03:29.950> have<00:03:30.100> this<00:03:30.190> really

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
different sizes like I have this really

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.070 
different sizes like I have this really

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
designs if I peel this off it's actually

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.620 
designs if I peel this off it's actually
a<00:03:47.380> sticker<00:03:47.739> and<00:03:48.010> you<00:03:48.100> can<00:03:48.250> stick<00:03:48.459> it<00:03:48.610> to<00:03:48.790> like<00:03:49.450> a

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
a sticker and you can stick it to like a

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.270 
a sticker and you can stick it to like a
hard<00:03:49.900> surface<00:03:50.110> so<00:03:50.440> I<00:03:50.530> can<00:03:50.799> stick<00:03:50.950> this<00:03:51.070> to<00:03:51.220> the

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
hard surface so I can stick this to the

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.560 
hard surface so I can stick this to the
her<00:03:51.370> side<00:03:51.519> it<00:03:51.730> will<00:03:51.850> be<00:03:52.000> there<00:03:52.209> and<00:03:52.390> then<00:03:52.480> I

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
her side it will be there and then I

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.570 
her side it will be there and then I
just<00:03:52.600> press<00:03:52.900> it<00:03:53.080> on<00:03:53.170> alright<00:03:53.769> for<00:03:54.070> me<00:03:54.220> working

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
just press it on alright for me working

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.880 
just press it on alright for me working
with<00:03:54.730> clay<00:03:55.090> it's<00:03:55.510> much<00:03:55.780> easier<00:03:56.200> if<00:03:56.320> I<00:03:56.470> have<00:03:56.680> one

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
with clay it's much easier if I have one

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.620 
with clay it's much easier if I have one
that's<00:03:57.010> flexible<00:03:57.310> because<00:03:57.970> let's<00:03:58.299> let's<00:03:58.480> say

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
that's flexible because let's let's say

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.720 
that's flexible because let's let's say
if<00:03:58.750> I<00:03:58.930> have<00:03:59.049> a<00:03:59.080> box<00:03:59.380> with<00:04:00.100> this<00:04:00.310> you're<00:04:00.640> gonna

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
if I have a box with this you're gonna

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.610 
if I have a box with this you're gonna
get<00:04:00.940> one<00:04:01.209> angle<00:04:01.630> 1<00:04:01.840> angle<00:04:02.019> only

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
get one angle 1 angle only

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.300 
get one angle 1 angle only
here<00:04:03.459> see<00:04:04.030> how<00:04:04.150> I<00:04:04.180> it's<00:04:04.930> just<00:04:05.080> stiff<00:04:05.500> well<00:04:06.159> with

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
here see how I it's just stiff well with

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.729 
here see how I it's just stiff well with
this<00:04:06.549> I<00:04:06.760> can<00:04:07.060> actually<00:04:07.090> take<00:04:07.629> it<00:04:07.810> and<00:04:08.110> bend<00:04:08.650> it

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
this I can actually take it and bend it

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.979 
this I can actually take it and bend it
and<00:04:08.890> wrap<00:04:09.129> it<00:04:09.280> I<00:04:09.489> can<00:04:10.150> go<00:04:10.239> all<00:04:10.420> the<00:04:10.569> way<00:04:10.599> around

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
and wrap it I can go all the way around

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.640 
and wrap it I can go all the way around
it<00:04:11.140> so<00:04:11.290> that<00:04:11.799> it<00:04:11.920> is<00:04:11.950> a<00:04:12.280> continuous<00:04:12.580> pattern

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
it so that it is a continuous pattern

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.710 
it so that it is a continuous pattern
there<00:04:14.650> it<00:04:14.890> doesn't<00:04:15.040> break<00:04:15.280> off<00:04:15.489> so<00:04:16.239> I<00:04:16.269> really

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
there it doesn't break off so I really

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.090 
there it doesn't break off so I really
like<00:04:16.930> these<00:04:17.109> they're<00:04:17.380> easy<00:04:17.620> to<00:04:17.889> keep<00:04:18.040> clean

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
like these they're easy to keep clean

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.650 
like these they're easy to keep clean
you<00:04:18.609> just<00:04:18.729> can<00:04:18.940> wipe<00:04:19.150> them<00:04:19.329> off<00:04:19.449> with<00:04:19.630> some

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
you just can wipe them off with some

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.379 
you just can wipe them off with some
baby<00:04:19.930> wipes<00:04:20.079> and<00:04:20.680> I<00:04:21.340> like<00:04:21.790> them<00:04:21.940> so<00:04:22.120> much<00:04:22.180> that

I went ahead and I bought a whole bunch
of<00:04:25.030> them<00:04:25.180> and<00:04:25.540> I<00:04:26.530> actually<00:04:27.130> still<00:04:27.790> work<00:04:28.030> with

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
of them and I actually still work with

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.800 
of them and I actually still work with
the<00:04:28.389> stance<00:04:28.690> I<00:04:29.560> actually<00:04:30.520> stamped<00:04:30.970> inside

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
the stance I actually stamped inside

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.420 
the stance I actually stamped inside
some<00:04:32.590> amazing<00:04:33.250> mold<00:04:33.580> putty<00:04:34.110> this<00:04:35.110> pumpkin<00:04:35.680> you

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
can see what it looks like and then I

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.750 
can see what it looks like and then I
poured<00:04:38.260> resin<00:04:38.560> in<00:04:38.650> it<00:04:38.770> and<00:04:38.919> I<00:04:39.010> actually<00:04:39.220> made<00:04:39.550> a

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
poured resin in it and I actually made a

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.879 
poured resin in it and I actually made a
pendant<00:04:40.240> that<00:04:40.720> looks<00:04:41.020> just<00:04:41.169> like<00:04:41.320> this<00:04:41.620> and

pendant that looks just like this and

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:44.550 
pendant that looks just like this and
then<00:04:42.039> I<00:04:42.130> went<00:04:42.250> ahead<00:04:42.400> and<00:04:42.550> colored<00:04:43.030> it<00:04:43.210> I<00:04:43.750> did

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
then I went ahead and colored it I did

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.430 
then I went ahead and colored it I did
it<00:04:44.680> with<00:04:44.830> orange<00:04:45.479> resin<00:04:46.479> and<00:04:46.660> then<00:04:47.050> I<00:04:47.169> went<00:04:47.350> in

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:17.040 
this side I could make a mold of it
press<00:05:14.889> it<00:05:14.919> in<00:05:15.160> there<00:05:15.340> and<00:05:15.490> then<00:05:15.760> copy<00:05:16.570> it<00:05:16.900> and

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
press it in there and then copy it and

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.719 
press it in there and then copy it and
turn<00:05:17.320> it<00:05:17.440> into<00:05:17.560> a<00:05:17.680> beautiful<00:05:17.889> pendant<00:05:18.340> with

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:18.729 
turn it into a beautiful pendant with

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:21.060 
turn it into a beautiful pendant with
glitter<00:05:19.389> and<00:05:19.630> stuff<00:05:19.870> like<00:05:20.020> that<00:05:20.260> so<00:05:20.500> something

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
glitter and stuff like that so something

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.510 
glitter and stuff like that so something
definitely<00:05:21.970> consider<00:05:22.360> I've<00:05:23.260> done<00:05:23.530> you<00:05:24.190> know<00:05:24.250> I

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
definitely consider I've done you know I

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.440 
definitely consider I've done you know I
made<00:05:24.849> actually<00:05:25.090> some<00:05:25.479> hand<00:05:25.720> mirrors<00:05:26.050> using

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
made actually some hand mirrors using

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.270 
made actually some hand mirrors using
without<00:05:28.450> a<00:05:28.479> polymer<00:05:28.930> clay<00:05:29.080> using<00:05:29.830> this<00:05:30.010> to

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
without a polymer clay using this to

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.680 
without a polymer clay using this to
make<00:05:30.310> the<00:05:30.610> design<00:05:30.880> and<00:05:31.060> then<00:05:31.150> I<00:05:31.210> put<00:05:31.419> jewels

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
make the design and then I put jewels

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.920 
make the design and then I put jewels
and<00:05:31.930> all<00:05:32.050> the<00:05:32.169> little<00:05:32.410> dots<00:05:33.330> so<00:05:34.330> it's<00:05:34.720> really

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
and all the little dots so it's really

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.320 
and all the little dots so it's really
nice<00:05:35.139> to<00:05:35.349> have<00:05:35.560> and<00:05:35.800> then<00:05:36.070> another<00:05:36.789> tool<00:05:37.090> I

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
nice to have and then another tool I

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.570 
nice to have and then another tool I
would<00:05:37.389> suggest<00:05:37.720> you<00:05:38.139> should<00:05:38.320> get<00:05:38.530> if<00:05:39.039> I<00:05:39.310> didn't

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
would suggest you should get if I didn't

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.870 
would suggest you should get if I didn't
talk<00:05:40.090> about<00:05:40.389> it<00:05:40.449> before<00:05:40.570> our<00:05:40.930> cookie<00:05:41.229> cutters

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
talk about it before our cookie cutters

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.950 
talk about it before our cookie cutters
they're<00:05:42.880> nice<00:05:43.090> to<00:05:43.240> have<00:05:43.389> you<00:05:43.690> can<00:05:43.840> have

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
they're nice to have you can have

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.990 
they're nice to have you can have
different<00:05:44.320> sizes<00:05:44.530> cookie<00:05:45.430> cutters<00:05:45.669> are<00:05:45.789> not

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
different sizes cookie cutters are not

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.670 
different sizes cookie cutters are not
easy<00:05:46.240> to<00:05:46.360> find<00:05:46.690> especially<00:05:47.229> when<00:05:47.320> it<00:05:47.440> comes<00:05:47.560> to

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
easy to find especially when it comes to

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.839 
easy to find especially when it comes to
polymer<00:05:48.039> clay<00:05:48.190> because<00:05:48.460> you<00:05:48.520> get<00:05:48.639> all<00:05:48.729> these

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:48.849 
polymer clay because you get all these

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:51.420 
polymer clay because you get all these
really<00:05:49.090> big<00:05:49.419> ones<00:05:49.630> and<00:05:50.039> if<00:05:51.039> you're<00:05:51.280> not

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
really big ones and if you're not

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.650 
really big ones and if you're not
wanting<00:05:51.820> to<00:05:51.880> make<00:05:52.120> something<00:05:52.360> so<00:05:52.720> big<00:05:52.990> I<00:05:53.349> have

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:54.660 
wanting to make something so big I have

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.510 
wanting to make something so big I have
and<00:05:55.320> you<00:05:55.440> can<00:05:55.590> find<00:05:55.830> those<00:05:55.980> on<00:05:56.040> the<00:05:56.220> polymer

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 
and you can find those on the polymer

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.830 
and you can find those on the polymer
clay<00:05:56.790> area<00:05:57.240> and<00:05:58.790> these<00:05:59.790> your<00:06:00.000> more<00:06:00.510> what<00:06:00.810> I

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
clay area and these your more what I

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.240 
clay area and these your more what I
actually<00:06:01.170> like<00:06:01.320> to<00:06:01.590> use<00:06:01.620> is<00:06:01.980> something

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
actually like to use is something

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.940 
actually like to use is something
tonight<00:06:02.550> like<00:06:02.880> this<00:06:03.290> but<00:06:04.290> what<00:06:04.440> if<00:06:04.560> I<00:06:04.680> want<00:06:04.890> to

tonight like this but what if I want to

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:09.970 
tonight like this but what if I want to
go<00:06:05.070> smaller<00:06:05.690> well<00:06:06.690> I<00:06:07.580> went<00:06:08.580> ahead<00:06:08.700> and<00:06:09.120> got

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:09.980 
go smaller well I went ahead and got

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.190 
go smaller well I went ahead and got
punches<00:06:10.980> for<00:06:11.760> paper<00:06:11.970> now<00:06:12.660> you<00:06:12.720> have<00:06:12.990> to<00:06:13.110> make

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:13.200 
punches for paper now you have to make

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.290 
punches for paper now you have to make
your<00:06:13.350> clay<00:06:13.500> extremely<00:06:14.070> thin<00:06:14.790> and<00:06:15.060> you<00:06:15.120> might

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
your clay extremely thin and you might

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.030 
your clay extremely thin and you might
actually<00:06:15.510> need<00:06:15.810> instead<00:06:16.500> of<00:06:16.560> using<00:06:16.770> this

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:17.040 
actually need instead of using this

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.440 
actually need instead of using this
you'll<00:06:17.280> have<00:06:17.430> to<00:06:17.640> actually<00:06:17.940> get<00:06:18.060> yourself<00:06:18.150> a

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:18.450 
you'll have to actually get yourself a

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.590 
you'll have to actually get yourself a
pasta<00:06:18.810> roller<00:06:18.990> and<00:06:19.290> set<00:06:20.100> it<00:06:20.190> on<00:06:20.600> probably

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 
pasta roller and set it on probably

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.770 
pasta roller and set it on probably
setting<00:06:21.990> want<00:06:22.590> well<00:06:22.920> setting<00:06:23.700> too<00:06:23.940> if<00:06:24.210> you<00:06:24.660> go

setting want well setting too if you go

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.080 
setting want well setting too if you go
to<00:06:24.840> setting<00:06:25.200> one<00:06:25.530> it's<00:06:25.860> too<00:06:26.400> thin<00:06:26.700> and<00:06:26.940> it'll

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.090 
to setting one it's too thin and it'll

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.330 
to setting one it's too thin and it'll
fall<00:06:27.330> apart<00:06:27.390> and<00:06:28.170> I<00:06:28.770> made<00:06:29.040> these<00:06:29.220> really

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:29.340 
fall apart and I made these really

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.760 
fall apart and I made these really
pretty<00:06:29.610> earrings<00:06:30.140> by<00:06:31.140> using<00:06:31.350> one<00:06:31.590> of<00:06:31.620> these
