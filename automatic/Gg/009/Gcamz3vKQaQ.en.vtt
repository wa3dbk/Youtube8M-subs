out of it

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.350 
out of it
the<00:00:59.950> cause<00:01:00.160> is<00:01:00.460> usually<00:01:00.490> just<00:01:01.090> a<00:01:01.150> little

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
the cause is usually just a little

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.120 
the cause is usually just a little
mechanical<00:01:01.480> hitch<00:01:02.140> where<00:01:02.500> the<00:01:02.710> trap<00:01:02.920> door
