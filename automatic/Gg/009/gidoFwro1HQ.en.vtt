00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:05.700
 [Music] 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.010
 how about youtube friends in this new 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.980
 video let's see an excellent 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:17.110
 application called cpu's eta which which 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.119
 It allows to know everything that incorporates 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.330
 our smartphone 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.980
 be it the software the good hardware what 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.390
 first thing we're going to do is go the 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.010
 play store we are going to download this 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.410
 excellent application of an application 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:34.540
 that weighs relatively little 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.540
 they do not take us out of a sector 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:41.660
 Here we will find it how it is produced 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:44.390
 let's put cpu z an excellent 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:49.340
 application that weighs a lot and little bit 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:51.550
 weight only 310 kilobytes and what we're going to 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.560
 do good now once we are here 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.260
 they will appear at the exit in several 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:00.110
 eyelashes that will be here what is the 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.090
 system the battery of the sensors the 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.540
 about the application and here what is 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.940
 as the ceo is on of the hardware and 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.160
 torrico incorporates our device 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:13.160
 well this case I have in this 4 this 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.479
 application serves us in first for 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.970
 know all the inside of our 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.920
 phone also helps us to know what 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.910
 that is the gpu now we will talk about it 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.650
 helps us to know if a phone 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.420
 those that are replicas or the Chinese 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.940
 that many of you want 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.910
 know if the truth is the true 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.530
 terminal or not good here shows up 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.450
 then how can you see which one with the dragon 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.090
 the logo of the factory of what it is 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.460
 the cpu that has this device in 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.950
 atoms 600 the 2 as he decides to get 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.990
 the speed that the clock of the 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.580
 processor here was another s in the 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:51.350
 cp architecture about 300 that this is 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.690
 central unit process unit 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.700
 process the cpu run the nuclei 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.259
 who have our device here 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.330
 we have a revision part on 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:03.080
 process that the truth I do not know what speed 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.030
 here we have 81 megahertz and 2.6 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.369
 gigahertz that is between the frequency 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.899
 that is moving the device here 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.880
 we have the four colors that in this 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.230
 case I have four cores the core 0 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.350
 that is to say that it is right now in the 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.060
 frequency of 1,190 and the 41 mails and 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.830
 correct if they are stopped 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.570
 every time that it is going to be very 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.489
 phone we can see that the 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:26.420
 application then it is also changing in 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:28.940
 cpu we already have 18% here in gpu sell 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.530
 comes being what with if we have in 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.220
 our case would be 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.230
 rm and here in gpu render that I have 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.970
 adhered 320 here we are going to make a 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.670
 small pause 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:44.510
 the gpu is the graphics central unit 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.080
 which is the one that moves our phone the 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.330
 gpu 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.520
 So far we have what is the 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.550
 dre not that for example here I have 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.880
 I 'm here, the galaxy's view 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.010
 of hay also that of the optimus game 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:03.000
 we have the malikÃ­ the samsung version 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:07.560
 galaxy s3 the power vr that is the 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:11.250
 intel intelola intel x 390 and also in 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.830
 the t gr that is the one in those of old 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.810
 version and more phones that incorporate 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.830
 these gpu good there are many cases of the 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.710
 games for example that we are 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.990
 downloading we see that gpu appears for 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:25.530
 mali for power 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:27.510
 vr tegra mother not in the game dead 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.860
 trigger that I have already a few days ago are 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.170
 enough comments that tell me that 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.180
 what version they download the case is that it is 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.010
 a version that is depends on the 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.110
 device that we have in this case 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.020
 I have a c4 that has ladren or 320 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.070
 Then download the adreno version 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.980
 of the game 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.060
 I will not download the key or the hand 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.459
 I have this one after downloading 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.440
 the bad and so correspondingly so 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.170
 that this part the truth is quite 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.940
 interesting and more this they know them 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.220
 that we will know then what the 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.660
 device if we do not know at the time of 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.490
 install a valgo fire 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.810
 here the part of the system then we have 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.810
 to see if it focuses well 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.470
 there we have 79 thousand 505 samsung in the 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.350
 baseband here we have the version of 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.750
 android android architecture 97 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.670
 kernel version of an edition 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.540
 here we have the screen resolution 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.700
 full hd pp and pixels per inch 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.140
 we have the total ram 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:30.710
 we have in the available memory we have 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:33.050
 41% internal memory 4.13 gb 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.870
 memory also available of those 4 13 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.060
 and here root access also verifies us 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.050
 if we have the noise it is also not 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.780
 the same function as the checkbook rout 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.580
 well what we have here in this 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.250
 application that appears here in the 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:52.169
 matter appears to us the state that is 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:53.879
 wood the level the battery too 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:56.310
 appears here in the technology of 

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:58.409
 plane the temperature and the voltage here 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.849
 also of the sensors because in the 

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:01.770
 sensors that count that 4 that every 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:03.029
 device account then there appears to us 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.740
 all the information 

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:07.419
 and here the about what good does not have 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:10.610
 a lot of history 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:12.199
 this part here I have the galaxy and we're going 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.680
 to see it also a little bit to see here 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:20.370
 is that they can see there is gpu the 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:23.010
 cores that one has the clock adreno 200 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.720
 let's say in the part of the system and equal 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.490
 the same way but then in each 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.710
 device will vary one way or 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.350
 another no brandes I hope that this has them 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.600
 many doubts remained about the cpu of 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.430
 the colors of the gpu so good 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.139
 I hope you subscribe to the channel I hope 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.669
 that you liked this video a greeting 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:40.669
 for all I do not know another next video
