in contrast to my last week's totals
there<00:00:04.470> I<00:00:06.230> actually<00:00:07.230> managed<00:00:07.830> to<00:00:07.890> french<00:00:08.370> fry

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550

there I actually managed to french fry
yesterday<00:00:09.030> a<00:00:09.269> fairly<00:00:09.960> simple<00:00:10.320> one<00:00:10.469> and

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
yesterday a fairly simple one and

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.379 
yesterday a fairly simple one and
yesterday<00:00:11.400> is<00:00:11.460> why<00:00:11.639> it's<00:00:11.820> all<00:00:11.940> fuzzy<00:00:12.210> now<00:00:12.540> but

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:14.389 
yesterday is why it's all fuzzy now but

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.560 
yesterday is why it's all fuzzy now but
my<00:00:15.389> solution<00:00:15.870> is<00:00:16.020> fairly<00:00:16.320> simple<00:00:16.740> I<00:00:17.570> really

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
my solution is fairly simple I really

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.900 
my solution is fairly simple I really
need<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.810> declare<00:00:19.080> by<00:00:19.320> my<00:00:19.470> hair<00:00:19.710> this<00:00:20.550> doesn't

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
need to declare by my hair this doesn't

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.269 
need to declare by my hair this doesn't
mean<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:21.119> braiding<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.140> yesterday<00:00:22.320> was<00:00:22.680> easy

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
mean that braiding it yesterday was easy

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.460 
mean that braiding it yesterday was easy
but<00:00:23.730> it<00:00:23.850> doesn't<00:00:24.240> mean<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.840> come<00:00:25.289> up<00:00:25.439> with

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
but it doesn't mean that I come up with

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.220 
but it doesn't mean that I come up with
handfuls<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.609> hair<00:00:26.869> afterwards<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:28.109> I've

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
handfuls of hair afterwards that I've

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.720 
handfuls of hair afterwards that I've
pulled<00:00:28.529> out<00:00:28.789> um<00:00:30.140> and<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.619> was<00:00:31.800> much<00:00:32.160> easier<00:00:32.189> for

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
pulled out um and it was much easier for

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.280 
pulled out um and it was much easier for
me<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.090> be<00:00:33.239> able<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.480> run<00:00:33.660> my<00:00:33.840> fingers<00:00:34.260> through

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
me to be able to run my fingers through

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.910 
me to be able to run my fingers through
it<00:00:34.670> but<00:00:35.670> one<00:00:35.910> thing<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.239> did<00:00:36.360> yesterday

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
it but one thing that I did yesterday

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.350 
it but one thing that I did yesterday
having<00:00:37.920> successfully<00:00:38.610> done<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.820> French<00:00:39.090> braid

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
having successfully done a French braid

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.830 
having successfully done a French braid
was<00:00:40.020> then<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.530> tucked<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.340> tail<00:00:41.579> up<00:00:41.910> inside<00:00:42.420> and

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
was then I tucked the tail up inside and

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.290 
was then I tucked the tail up inside and
it<00:00:43.110> made<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.320> really<00:00:43.680> nice<00:00:44.010> updo<00:00:44.610> for<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.940> warm

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
it made a really nice updo for a warm

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.740 
it made a really nice updo for a warm
day<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:46.559> I'd<00:00:46.649> like<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:47.010> attempt<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.940> do<00:00:48.719> that

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
day and I'd like to attempt to do that

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.060 
day and I'd like to attempt to do that
again<00:00:50.809> because<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:52.050> had<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.350> lot<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.559> questions

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
again because I had a lot of questions

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.590 
again because I had a lot of questions
and<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:53.280> posted<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.699> photo<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.360> how<00:00:54.570> I

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
and I posted a photo of it of how I

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.479 
and I posted a photo of it of how I
actually<00:00:54.870> managed<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.469> put<00:00:55.680> all<00:00:55.860> my<00:00:55.890> link<00:00:56.280> up

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
actually managed to put all my link up

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.349 
actually managed to put all my link up
inside<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.719> French<00:00:57.989> braid<00:00:58.850> first<00:00:59.850> step<00:01:00.149> a

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
inside the French braid first step a

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.500 
inside the French braid first step a
cheat<00:01:00.899> i<00:01:01.109> shortened<00:01:01.680> my<00:01:01.829> braid<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.340> braided<00:01:03.239> it

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
cheat i shortened my braid I braided it

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.179 
cheat i shortened my braid I braided it
down<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.110> wrap<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.559> ends<00:01:04.860> up<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.159> I

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
down and I wrap the ends up and I

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.880 
down and I wrap the ends up and I
probably<00:01:05.430> have<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.760> shortened<00:01:06.270> by<00:01:06.500> yeah<00:01:07.500> about

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
probably have it shortened by yeah about

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.899 
probably have it shortened by yeah about
a<00:01:08.040> foot

our excuse in one place now I have this

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:05.029 
our excuse in one place now I have this
loop<00:02:03.049> see<00:02:04.049> if<00:02:04.110> I<00:02:04.200> can<00:02:04.379> remember<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:04.739> did<00:02:05.009> this

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
loop see if I can remember I did this

yesterday

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.180 

but<00:02:13.870> one<00:02:14.080> thing<00:02:14.380> that<00:02:14.410> makes<00:02:14.740> it<00:02:14.890> a<00:02:14.950> little

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
but one thing that makes it a little

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.400 
but one thing that makes it a little
easier<00:02:15.580> is<00:02:16.470> after<00:02:17.470> I<00:02:17.500> sectioned<00:02:18.130> off<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:19.410> top

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
easier is after I sectioned off the top

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.230 
easier is after I sectioned off the top
part<00:02:20.890> of<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.100> hair<00:02:21.280> to<00:02:21.400> begin<00:02:21.550> with<00:02:21.970> French

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
part of the hair to begin with French

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.980 
part of the hair to begin with French
braid

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
braid

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.360 
braid
I<00:02:23.520> made<00:02:24.520> a<00:02:25.170> part<00:02:26.170> in<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.680> middle<00:02:26.860> of<00:02:27.070> the<00:02:27.190> back

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
I made a part in the middle of the back

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.530 
I made a part in the middle of the back
of<00:02:27.580> my<00:02:27.730> head<00:02:28.000> and<00:02:29.040> so<00:02:30.040> I<00:02:30.370> took<00:02:30.520> hair<00:02:30.970> from<00:02:31.360> the

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
of my head and so I took hair from the

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.900 
of my head and so I took hair from the
left<00:02:31.750> and<00:02:31.930> the<00:02:32.050> right<00:02:32.400> very<00:02:33.400> clearly
