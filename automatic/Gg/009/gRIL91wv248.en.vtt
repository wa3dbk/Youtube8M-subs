well as the five HDMI ends the one on
the<00:02:11.290> front<00:02:11.560> would<00:02:11.680> be<00:02:11.740> say

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
the front would be say

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.739 
the front would be say
let's<00:02:14.819> see<00:02:15.060> here<00:02:15.329> you'll<00:02:15.450> also<00:02:15.480> have<00:02:15.689> a

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:15.749 
let's see here you'll also have a

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:21.140 
let's see here you'll also have a
component<00:02:16.230> out<00:02:17.180> we<00:02:18.180> am/fm<00:02:19.340> connections<00:02:20.340> this

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
component out we am/fm connections this

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.190 
component out we am/fm connections this
thing<00:02:21.389> also<00:02:21.719> does<00:02:21.959> a<00:02:22.549> 8h<00:02:23.549> a<00:02:24.090> channel<00:02:24.989> audio

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
thing also does a 8h a channel audio

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.140 
thing also does a 8h a channel audio
input<00:02:26.069> and<00:02:26.629> output<00:02:27.829> specific<00:02:28.909> then<00:02:29.909> you<00:02:30.000> have

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
input and output specific then you have

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:37.629 
input and output specific then you have
your<00:02:30.379> standard<00:02:32.060> speaker<00:02:33.060> wire<00:02:33.689> connectors

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:37.639 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:41.089 

and<00:02:38.639> just<00:02:38.849> you<00:02:38.939> see<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.329> same<00:02:39.540> supports<00:02:40.109> 1<00:02:40.739> &amp;<00:02:40.950> 2

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
and just you see the same supports 1 &amp; 2

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.190 
and just you see the same supports 1 &amp; 2
audio<00:02:41.340> zones<00:02:41.879> so<00:02:42.060> you<00:02:42.150> can<00:02:42.299> actually<00:02:42.480> channel

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
audio zones so you can actually channel

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.209 
audio zones so you can actually channel
out<00:02:43.349> to<00:02:43.680> a<00:02:44.280> second<00:02:44.969> receiver<00:02:45.329> and<00:02:45.889> this<00:02:46.889> can

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:47.219 
out to a second receiver and this can

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:49.429 
out to a second receiver and this can
