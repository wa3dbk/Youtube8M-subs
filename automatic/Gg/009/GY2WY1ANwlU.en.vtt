 we saw the launch of ipi or 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:01.010
 ebay and was very impressed the where 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.949
 happened in the market where someone created 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:07.400
 an auction company to a market 

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:10.280
 digital and its weight and I can not 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.359
 It's worth so much money but daring has 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.329
 price 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:16.989
 soon the internet bubble burst beyond 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:19.789
 the dot-com crisis and debt 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:22.699
 faced strong new resistance 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:25.250
 tool in the early years of the company 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:27.110
 them in the habit of understanding a 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.240
 the auction process simply a 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.740
 where there is a lemon tree and the public 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.280
 presential 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.650
 people obviously not understood to 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.300
 the power of the tool for fear of 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.210
 the person who is bidding does not saddle 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.949
 even the person who could actually bid 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.800
 that it was her that she had not 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:48.349
 how to honor the payment had several 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.389
 challenges to be broken at the beginning was 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:52.460
 a very poor evaluation 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:53.910
 nowadays the evaluation is very 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.360
 extensive and very 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:05:00.270
 the detailed rigid control of the whole 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:04.430
 process and checking the information 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:08.190
 Accurate reports won over mistrust 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.570
 videos clear rules and transparency 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.510
 gave result 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.430
 are more than 50 thousand lots sold until 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:17.430
 moment of reporting 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:20.130
 the audience of the site impresses about 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:23.280
 15 million visitors per month 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:25.170
 one client brings the other and so 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.750
 superbid has come far 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:28.530
 today operates in five countries in 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.140
 south 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.850
 you access electronically 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:36.240
 of that person's registration information 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:39.930
 make sure she's mine is mine and it is 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.790
 and a form that also crosses with 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.400
 address with a phone where you can 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:46.470
 love was where she bought a place and 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.930
 if the skill is given are the same as 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.280
 she put it on mine at her registry and 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.780
 ended up no longer able to participate in the 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:55.080
 auctions until he accepts this 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:57.720
 financial suspension of a fine is me and 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.610
 auctioned again well then end the 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:03.590
 There is no such thing as a delinquency. 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.590
 I deliver nothing if I have not paid, right?
