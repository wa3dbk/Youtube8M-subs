00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.589
 so my friends welcome back to 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.090
 another episode of a pokémon 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:12.150
 al-gaddafi let's play charts with me that 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.920
 rain and today so there we have 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.450
 another trio yes I actually have 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.869
 now not feel like another fire to 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.119
 catch but there are certain things that 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.230
 Unfortunately, we do not force that to happen 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.699
 need to do now among others 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.580
 depor only on certain weekday 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.380
 turn up and I plan now 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.769
 actually start immediately with the trio 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.550
 can 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.510
 because that would actually be with am 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.329
 most optimal if you ask me that way 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.350
 that's why now just say 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.960
 let's just catch that 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.910
 legendary musketeer trios is yes 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.309
 actually a quartet but katy 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.870
 I just do not tell you now 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.590
 we can play the only other 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.980
 fear 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.719
 ok said and done to us all 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.789
 depending on it is quite easy as all 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.610
 it's three in your team 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.780
 pokémon score with maximum diligence 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.480
 We can equal points in this 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.579
 look at the screen namely in the bottom 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.580
 sown there , for example, we see the 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.380
 right the right bar at break 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.090
 For example , it is full of volumes 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.130
 and we see up here 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.180
 all basic values ​​were completed 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.549
 trains a populist and one 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.680
 master examination congratulations 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:19.290
 if we have that at three pokémon's 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.080
 is a break is angry okay you 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.229
 do not not have against Albstadt 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.280
 but yellow probably has four and has too 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.140
 that means we have at least three 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.630
 pokémon have this on maximum yourself 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.579
 requirement fulfilled well then you can 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.520
 we are directly on ours 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.560
 or about our land so that he rises 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.900
 the action is that each at circle and 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.000
 Depending on the day of the week you can now namely 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:47.020
 once the 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.140
 musketeers won on the nameless 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:54.120
 besides nils i think catch and how 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.470
 I think we can today like 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:00.210
 embrace 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.210
 So that is how the rhi to was 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:12.010
 Thursdays and Mondays therapy and 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:12.910
 You can on Saturdays and Tuesdays 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.770
 captured 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.970
 I already have mornings and cars 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.510
 And potassium can be had on Wednesdays 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.740
 say 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.930
 catch on Fridays and Sundays 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.340
 It was the same with me and today 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.170
 would therefore have the region accordingly 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.150
 be and you feel a calm look 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.250
 I want to check who wants me 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.570
 because here I have no nice testing 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.060
 pale shimmer who it will be 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.020
 but apparently someone has an eye 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.460
 thrown at us 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.380
 that means if now on the 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.880
 nameless level her memory beside that 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.310
 game and is now here 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.490
 in the program item in this portal 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:52.330
 inside I'm curious who is 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:55.770
 By the way, it's an old video music 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:58.270
 store we are pretty good 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.950
 of course 58 again and we will 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.950
 now first the thundering wave bid 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.840
 was're walter brandy what for 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.120
 Go on with you, you have a stinging sword 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.520
 Survived by a video considered 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.950
 forgive pretty well so easily 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.610
 breaky heart not a single neutral 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.310
 Handle 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.830
 attack against this video will be on 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.680
 with rallye has no chance against fight 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.120
 landshut want 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.320
 despite rockfall here pretty good 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.180
 damage done that easy 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.290
 it that we have the reversal in the special 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.240
 defensive 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:36.040
 you are and video is above all things 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:39.970
 in the cup I especially now the 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.610
 tc the video ex very good card is 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.740
 not for nothing in the current world champion 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.959
 deck inside the region go west says 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.480
 Partners pavilion use 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.680
 honestly so the only legendary 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.370
 pokémon to which I do not care at all 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.970
 can tell 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:57.100
 I do not know why that is but the 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.420
 wise I pretty seldom use the 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.310
 clips probably that william 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.040
 is religious and I do religiously 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.620
 is really the meter game with me 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.000
 pretty much did not bother me much 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.000
 I do not know why it is not practical 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.750
 not really not no work the 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.900
 but have been engaged in religious matters 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.489
 apparently that was not the case 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.799
 important to me, too, no idea why 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.810
 I still have a little something to video 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.810
 tell that had the type fight 

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:34.590
 the eye of the tiger but why 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:35.909
 No, that was shit she had 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:41.280
 pumped up again what is it 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:44.250
 five seater supposed was good 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.860
 stopped helium is hold 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.440
 pokémon that is special in the special 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.590
 defensive well, I believe 129 special 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.780
 Future has the type plant you 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.120
 know fight types have all three 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.280
 of whom and we have talk too 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.020
 no matter how funny a comic looks 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.659
 that are not so funny on anyone 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:07.379
 But this head can do it 

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:10.590
 apparently it's always the same 

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:12.210
 still underestimate pretty good pokémon 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.159
 I think I 've got over 1 1 million 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.990
 I think I even completely 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:18.710
 even what i consider competitive 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:22.860
 battlestar could not do that 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:24.060
 Thought The Eye Says Okay 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.219
 I know never says but it is true 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.979
 special focus leaf focus and pout 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:30.389
 his fire is a really cool set 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:31.590
 I like it too 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:34.469
 it can always be with, for example 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.639
 sword dance play so yes I can 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:37.500
 but not so much to talk about now 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:39.300
 because I would never play with him 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.289
 but is a two-meter wide 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:44.490
 tenements kilograms 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:45.779
 vettel fourth of the deceived his 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.560
 opponent with nimble moves and 

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:58.800
 protect the pokémon medium like me 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:06:02.009
 namely'm just emmerich yes that 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.919
 So were the Monday and people 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:06.270
 Fridays the nameless levels on Mondays 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:09.500
 and on Thursdays so on the unnamed 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:13.370
 level then you get there 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.880
 the video is a good book you should 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.590
 get you 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:19.240
 The cable was the best 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:23.510
 from the balcony is because kappelt lingering 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:25.280
 So a bit of sport before too much 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.260
 Offensive has the better ones too 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.570
 more damage from sharing the physical 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.040
 side with technicians even while the 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.450
 government message not quite so 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.540
 can keep 

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:40.700
 the two hand in the movies have like that 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:41.420
 we have you david cameron in the tender 

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:47.600
 being 

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:49.640
 I already see it special 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.500
 defense and it has - 

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.390
 Defense Minister has also from the 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:56.750
 hail as much damage he concedes 

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:58.370
 good to know but otherwise so 

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.960
 also seen relatively quickly no 

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:02.570
 slow pokémon and his special 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:04.370
 Rips acceptable and very sword dance 

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:06.770
 mr We have also told 

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:08.500
 doping is for you exactly but you can 

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:11.330
 then heating funny sword scepter 

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:14.030
 tinkering believes that even weibel with 

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:15.260
 sankyo blade seed bomb and of course 

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:18.080
 any other movie book 

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:19.250
 steinhardter rises exactly what earthquakes 

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.729
 they have pokémon in flight its 

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:25.100
 mercilessly but I wanted 

00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:28.420
 then präferiere but rather the 

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:31.360
 are thought to be honest 

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:33.460
 he notes that this was a pleasant one 

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.840
 I was very happy to fight 

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:37.240
 however, the division does exist too 

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.890
 so do not be very happy and support and 

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:41.110
 we'll meet again when 

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:44.680
 we stop the next two movies and 

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:47.050
 namely found heraklion and kos 

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:49.740
 until then, has a fattening optics and 

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.740
 expensive
