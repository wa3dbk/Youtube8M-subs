00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:07.540
 wholemeal orecchiette with broccoli speck 

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:09.309
 au gratin slices the fastest recipe 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.950
 longer the title actually of the 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:14.580
 realization of the recipe 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:22.130
 hello made the jump 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:26.220
 some is all here takes me little is known 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:28.170
 hello but a jump less since I have the 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.790
 I want to use slices in the fridge 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.430
 we also put the slices and alloy 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.050
 we really do want to bake it 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.879
 they could also use other cheeses if 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.739
 one wants however with the slice becomes 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:42.080
 the cream of it all is beautiful 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:46.860
 recipe is that I use a lot of onion 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:52.790
 annoyed too excited then by 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:54.839
 pregnant I have already blanched the broccoli 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.299
 perfect in season here I have already put 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:58.589
 the oil because in this recipe there goes to 

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:59.940
 so much onion 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:01.199
 this is something I think is a bit 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.239
 of the tradition also of mine 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.150
 family where we always did this 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.010
 pasta with broccoli and white onion 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.290
 but a lot that must be made to stew a 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.689
 low heat become transparent thus 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.520
 it also becomes perfectly digestible and 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.369
 now I add all and we do it 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.170
 cook over low heat 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.930
 add the broccoli and broccoli love 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.460
 parboiled in salted water made not 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.230
 too soft because it's nice that it is 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.150
 still feel quite crunchy and 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.500
 cut into small pieces 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.930
 at this point we can fire 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.640
 absolutely turn up what first not 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.610
 we did because if we do n't burn the 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:40.530
 onion becomes indigestible and knows only of 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:43.530
 burned pepper as if it rained pepper from 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.820
 grate black pepper at the moment 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.510
 you can also add chilli 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.510
 obviously 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.690
 and remained a text told of seeing a 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:57.990
 meter on the table is perfect for even 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.510
 more comfortable so then with the city 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.250
 guided then already cut the speck to 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.980
 slices into cubes as you like 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.470
 obviously that cut absolutely 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.510
 unimportant we add it to 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.120
 broccoli and we cook it in this 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:14.810
 good case because I am pregnant will be 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.810
 I advise 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.410
 since this pasta I am afraid that from 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.170
 a moment to the other place scuoce 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.720
 relative persuasive with the disc and the 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.920
 I finish cooking as simone la says 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.900
 risotto in a pan and actually for one 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.850
 more traditional recipe should be 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.090
 here added a kick here 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.980
 Apulian ricotta or something 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.360
 instead we we go and put the 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.930
 cocotte that seemed to me enough 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.910
 cute coke 8 if you don't have a cocotte 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.920
 like this one in cast iron is fine too 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.170
 very simple quotas too 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.270
 that you use to make sweets that go 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.550
 in the oven maybe with basic ceramics 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.070
 important that it goes into the oven 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.200
 consider that these are always 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.300
 single portions ie single portions of 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:07.910
 normal person allowed want 4 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:09.890
 I say cost with speck nola close 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.500
 so no lid, however, to serve 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:18.380
 very pretty with the lid and in 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:20.450
 in this case we add the slice myself 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.780
 I had in the fridge and that normally 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.690
 it is used however in this case for 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:30.130
 we are perfect because we are going to melt 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.130
 in an instant in the oven 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.450
 keep it with grill function five 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.890
 minutes are fine too 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.330
 this is the effect then a little 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.790
 au gratin if you want you can add 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.260
 above also a bit of breadcrumbs e 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.150
 obviously leave it more in the oven vi 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.820
 a little baked dough effect 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:54.510
 croccantina with melting cheese 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:56.460
 immediately above perhaps with two theses 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.040
 nor so avoided doing it and of course 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.140
 all other recipes to everyone else 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:09.720
 videos are on the clear youtube channel 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:13.160
 ctv tv bunches okay we'll look hello a 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.160
 soon can send now 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:30.050
 but from the carrier and wonderful 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.050
 modular
