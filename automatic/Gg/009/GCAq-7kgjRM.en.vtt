00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
should try and try and just keep things

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.499 
should try and try and just keep things
in<00:01:58.979> perspective<00:01:59.100> because<00:01:59.909> things<00:02:00.240> are<00:02:00.390> never

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
in perspective because things are never

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.090 
in perspective because things are never
as<00:02:00.630> bad<00:02:00.750> as<00:02:00.930> we<00:02:01.229> think<00:02:01.380> they<00:02:01.500> are<00:02:02.240> so<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:04.560> first

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
as bad as we think they are so the first

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.910 
as bad as we think they are so the first
