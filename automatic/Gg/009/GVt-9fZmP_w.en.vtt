you should know the soundboard is built

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:40.320 
you should know the soundboard is built
into<00:00:38.019> the<00:00:38.199> piano<00:00:38.559> under<00:00:38.860> pressure<00:00:39.400> the<00:00:39.970> rim<00:00:40.299> of

into the piano under pressure the rim of

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.259 
into the piano under pressure the rim of
the<00:00:40.659> piano<00:00:40.930> holds<00:00:41.710> the<00:00:41.799> soundboard<00:00:42.280> causing<00:00:43.180> a

the piano holds the soundboard causing a

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:45.299 
the piano holds the soundboard causing a
slight<00:00:43.510> upward<00:00:43.900> arching<00:00:44.710> which<00:00:44.890> is<00:00:45.040> called

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309 
slight upward arching which is called

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.119 
slight upward arching which is called
the<00:00:45.460> crown<00:00:45.989> this<00:00:46.989> is<00:00:47.199> what<00:00:47.350> gives<00:00:47.589> its<00:00:47.769> piano

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129 
the crown this is what gives its piano

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:51.090 
the crown this is what gives its piano
the<00:00:48.879> incredible<00:00:49.690> power<00:00:49.989> and<00:00:50.379> sustain<00:00:50.830> of<00:00:51.010> the

the incredible power and sustain of the
tone<00:00:51.400> without<00:00:52.119> that<00:00:52.659> crowd<00:00:53.019> the<00:00:53.409> soundboard

tone without that crowd the soundboard

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:55.979 
tone without that crowd the soundboard
flattens<00:00:54.369> out<00:00:54.549> you<00:00:55.119> could<00:00:55.360> put<00:00:55.510> new<00:00:55.689> strings

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
flattens out you could put new strings

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.679 
flattens out you could put new strings
you<00:00:56.589> can<00:00:56.619> put<00:00:57.430> new<00:00:57.549> hammers<00:00:57.939> you<00:00:58.180> can<00:00:58.330> do<00:00:58.420> all

00:00:58.679 --> 00:00:58.689 
you can put new hammers you can do all

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:59.670 
you can put new hammers you can do all
the<00:00:58.930> work<00:00:59.140> you<00:00:59.290> want

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
the work you want

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.609 
the work you want
you'll<00:01:00.010> never<00:01:00.309> get<00:01:00.549> satisfying<00:01:01.180> results<00:01:01.989> so

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:02.619 
you'll never get satisfying results so

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:04.619 
you'll never get satisfying results so
in<00:01:02.949> rebuilding<00:01:03.339> pianos<00:01:03.970> it's<00:01:04.119> important<00:01:04.570> to

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
in rebuilding pianos it's important to

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:05.969 
in rebuilding pianos it's important to
choose<00:01:04.780> instruments<00:01:05.290> that<00:01:05.350> have<00:01:05.590> good<00:01:05.770> sound

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
choose instruments that have good sound

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.219 
choose instruments that have good sound
boards<00:01:06.430> now<00:01:06.909> can<00:01:07.150> you<00:01:07.240> replace<00:01:07.600> a<00:01:07.659> sound<00:01:08.020> board

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
boards now can you replace a sound board

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:09.660 
boards now can you replace a sound board
well<00:01:08.890> yes

the front of the piano the logic being
that<00:01:20.499> for<00:01:20.890> all<00:01:21.039> purposes<00:01:21.369> it<00:01:21.909> is<00:01:22.060> not<00:01:22.359> the

that for all purposes it is not the
original<00:01:22.689> Cannell<00:01:23.499> anymore<00:01:23.979> then<00:01:24.219> if<00:01:24.490> you<00:01:24.670> had

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:24.789 
original Cannell anymore then if you had

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:26.910 
original Cannell anymore then if you had
a<00:01:24.820> strata<00:01:25.149> bar<00:01:25.359> and<00:01:25.539> Spile<00:01:25.840> in<00:01:26.109> and<00:01:26.350> the<00:01:26.679> top

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
a strata bar and Spile in and the top

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.529 
a strata bar and Spile in and the top
was<00:01:27.249> gone<00:01:27.490> and<00:01:27.789> it<00:01:27.909> was<00:01:27.999> replaced<00:01:28.240> with

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:28.539 
was gone and it was replaced with

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:30.209 
was gone and it was replaced with
another<00:01:28.600> top<00:01:29.020> that's<00:01:29.560> not<00:01:29.799> a<00:01:29.829> Stradivarius

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:30.219 
another top that's not a Stradivarius

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:33.779 
another top that's not a Stradivarius
anymore<00:01:30.999> so<00:01:31.780> all<00:01:32.499> the<00:01:32.740> pianos<00:01:33.069> that<00:01:33.100> I<00:01:33.310> rebuild

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789 
anymore so all the pianos that I rebuild

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:35.609 
anymore so all the pianos that I rebuild
I<00:01:33.969> make<00:01:34.270> sure<00:01:34.479> that<00:01:34.630> I<00:01:34.689> have<00:01:34.929> instruments<00:01:35.469> in<00:01:35.530> a

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
I make sure that I have instruments in a

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:37.980 
I make sure that I have instruments in a
good<00:01:35.979> sound<00:01:36.249> boards<00:01:36.549> to<00:01:36.700> work<00:01:36.880> with<00:01:37.119> or<00:01:37.600> I<00:01:37.659> pass

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
good sound boards to work with or I pass

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.660 
good sound boards to work with or I pass
on<00:01:38.289> them<00:01:38.560> because<00:01:39.159> I<00:01:39.219> want<00:01:39.399> to<00:01:39.460> get<00:01:39.549> the

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
on them because I want to get the

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.480 
on them because I want to get the
character<00:01:40.240> of<00:01:40.329> the<00:01:40.420> original<00:01:40.810> instruments

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
character of the original instruments

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.730 
character of the original instruments
for<00:01:42.490> example<00:01:42.549> this<00:01:43.210> point<00:01:43.600> is<00:01:43.869> probably<00:01:44.319> one

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
for example this point is probably one

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.739 
for example this point is probably one
in<00:01:44.770> a<00:01:45.100> thousand<00:01:45.729> and<00:01:45.909> that<00:01:46.090> is<00:01:46.240> not<00:01:46.450> an

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:46.749 
in a thousand and that is not an

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:49.800 
in a thousand and that is not an
exaggeration<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:49.030> piano<00:01:49.240> was<00:01:49.389> originally

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.290 
the only way to really fix that properly
is<00:02:34.930> to<00:02:35.440> remove<00:02:35.740> the<00:02:35.980> plate<00:02:36.310> and<00:02:36.580> rebuild<00:02:37.180> the

is to remove the plate and rebuild the

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.200 
is to remove the plate and rebuild the
piano<00:02:37.600> but<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.560> good<00:02:38.800> news<00:02:39.010> is<00:02:39.250> that<00:02:39.490> you<00:02:39.820> can

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
piano but the good news is that you can

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.150 
piano but the good news is that you can
get<00:02:40.480> good<00:02:40.690> results<00:02:41.230> with<00:02:41.410> sound<00:02:41.680> boards<00:02:41.980> and

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
get good results with sound boards and

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.730 
get good results with sound boards and
have<00:02:42.310> open<00:02:43.000> cracks<00:02:43.330> cracks<00:02:44.110> that<00:02:44.350> are<00:02:44.440> tight

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
have open cracks cracks that are tight

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.980 
have open cracks cracks that are tight
and<00:02:44.980> sealed<00:02:45.280> present<00:02:45.700> no<00:02:45.820> problem<00:02:46.330> if<00:02:46.540> they

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
and sealed present no problem if they

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.350 
and sealed present no problem if they
open<00:02:47.440> up<00:02:47.620> like<00:02:48.250> a<00:02:48.280> piano<00:02:48.580> that<00:02:48.820> goes<00:02:49.000> to<00:02:49.120> a<00:02:49.180> very

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
open up like a piano that goes to a very

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.510 
open up like a piano that goes to a very
dry<00:02:49.900> environment<00:02:50.800> that<00:02:50.890> has<00:02:51.040> interline

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
dry environment that has interline

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.850 
dry environment that has interline
cracks<00:02:51.820> it's<00:02:52.230> possible<00:02:53.230> those<00:02:53.350> cracks<00:02:53.650> could

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
cracks it's possible those cracks could

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.250 
cracks it's possible those cracks could
open<00:02:54.160> up<00:02:54.280> and<00:02:54.550> cause<00:02:54.790> problems<00:02:55.480> later

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
open up and cause problems later

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.800 
open up and cause problems later
so<00:02:56.800> therefore<00:02:57.100> when<00:02:57.850> a<00:02:57.910> piano<00:02:58.240> is<00:02:58.390> rebuilt

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
so therefore when a piano is rebuilt

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.440 
so therefore when a piano is rebuilt
it's<00:02:59.080> possible<00:02:59.740> to<00:02:59.890> repair<00:03:00.220> those<00:03:00.400> cracks<00:03:00.790> how

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
it's possible to repair those cracks how

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.080 
it's possible to repair those cracks how
is<00:03:01.660> this<00:03:01.750> done<00:03:02.020> well<00:03:02.800> once<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:03.520> plate<00:03:03.760> is<00:03:03.940> off

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
is this done well once the plate is off

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.420 
is this done well once the plate is off
you<00:03:04.330> can<00:03:04.480> get<00:03:04.660> to<00:03:04.840> everything<00:03:05.350> the<00:03:05.890> soundboard

when the piano is rebuilt so how do you
know<00:03:34.600> if<00:03:34.780> your<00:03:34.900> piano<00:03:35.110> has<00:03:35.350> cracks<00:03:35.680> will<00:03:35.980> you

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
know if your piano has cracks will you

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.700 
know if your piano has cracks will you
look<00:03:36.390> under<00:03:37.390> and<00:03:37.660> to<00:03:37.960> come<00:03:38.140> with<00:03:38.290> me<00:03:38.440> for<00:03:38.650> a
