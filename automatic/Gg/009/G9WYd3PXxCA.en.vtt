flexibility in the hamstrings the second

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.320 
flexibility in the hamstrings the second
form<00:01:38.190> will<00:01:38.400> take<00:01:38.640> more<00:01:38.940> swinging

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
form will take more swinging

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.410 
form will take more swinging
coordination<00:01:40.580> you<00:01:41.580> are<00:01:41.729> going<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.150> swing

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
coordination you are going to swing

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.219 
coordination you are going to swing
through<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.810> movement<00:01:43.409> using<00:01:43.710> momentum<00:01:44.030> as

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
through the movement using momentum as

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
you swing through the movement you're

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.880 
you swing through the movement you're
going<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.240> push<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.659> bar<00:01:48.869> away<00:01:49.229> from<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.710> as

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
going to push the bar away from you as

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.499 
going to push the bar away from you as
you<00:01:49.950> curl<00:01:50.399> your<00:01:50.430> toes<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.270> bar

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:58.130 
you curl your toes to the bar
explosively<00:01:55.520> now<00:01:56.520> remember<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.390> momentum

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
explosively now remember the momentum

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.170 
explosively now remember the momentum
you<00:01:58.170> use<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:59.040> less<00:01:59.190> of<00:01:59.220> an<00:01:59.430> isolation

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
you use the less of an isolation

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.999 
you use the less of an isolation
exercise<00:02:00.659> this<00:02:00.960> will<00:02:01.110> become<00:02:01.440> for<00:02:01.710> your<00:02:01.800> abs

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.830 

so<00:02:05.009> there<00:02:05.160> you<00:02:05.280> have<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.550> the<00:02:05.880> total<00:02:06.330> bar<00:02:06.539> I

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
so there you have it the total bar I

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.300 
so there you have it the total bar I
