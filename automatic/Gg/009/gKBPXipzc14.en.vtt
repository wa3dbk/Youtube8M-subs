the zipper wraps around the waist and

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.160 
the zipper wraps around the waist and
then<00:00:27.849> comes<00:00:28.090> around<00:00:28.359> the<00:00:28.449> front<00:00:28.720> and<00:00:28.900> if<00:00:29.019> you

lift<00:00:36.670> it<00:00:36.790> up<00:00:36.909> it's<00:00:37.150> pretty<00:00:37.360> easy<00:00:37.540> and<00:00:37.900> it's<00:00:38.019> a

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
lift it up it's pretty easy and it's a

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.289 
lift it up it's pretty easy and it's a
stretchy<00:00:38.409> knit<00:00:38.710> the<00:00:39.430> only<00:00:39.640> downside<00:00:40.089> of<00:00:40.120> this

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:40.299 
stretchy knit the only downside of this

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:41.939 
stretchy knit the only downside of this
skirt<00:00:40.540> I<00:00:40.659> would<00:00:40.809> say<00:00:40.960> is<00:00:41.140> it<00:00:41.320> adds<00:00:41.500> just<00:00:41.799> a

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:41.949 
skirt I would say is it adds just a

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:43.890 
skirt I would say is it adds just a
little<00:00:41.979> extra<00:00:42.640> bulk<00:00:42.940> but<00:00:43.390> I<00:00:43.540> think<00:00:43.780> it<00:00:43.870> looks

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900 
little extra bulk but I think it looks

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.189 
little extra bulk but I think it looks
really<00:00:44.320> good<00:00:44.650> if<00:00:44.860> you<00:00:44.979> have<00:00:45.010> a<00:00:45.159> butt<00:00:45.489> and<00:00:46.199> hips

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199 
really good if you have a butt and hips

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:49.649 
really good if you have a butt and hips
and<00:00:47.620> a<00:00:47.710> waist<00:00:47.949> it'll<00:00:48.729> really<00:00:48.879> accentuate

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:49.659 
and a waist it'll really accentuate

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:52.320 
and a waist it'll really accentuate
