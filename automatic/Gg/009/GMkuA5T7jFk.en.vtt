00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello to all we will see 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.170
 today the stroller new trio of 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:12.139
 schilb dream so that's it's done 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:14.940
 since 701 on it's the handle 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.719
 to enlarge of course for the 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.719
 very tall people 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:28.400
 so the stroller consists of a seat 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.599
 self of a basket and a stroller 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.070
 for older children 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.010
 bigger 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:37.309
 So here we are going to install a seat 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:42.960
 automatically 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:47.210
 so here's the car seat there you see 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.210
 you have to put them in scrap hole 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:01:03.899
 it came back to lean on 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:06.290
 sees the dregs at 2 and a button not so a 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.650
 button to actually drink it is for 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:14.640
 bougival the branch is the ways for 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:18.540
 move a wrist like this you see 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.790
 so he makes the handle move 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:28.439
 that he actually follows towards the edge and 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:29.909
 the other side so this is it 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.350
 the button actually to remove the knows 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.970
 lottery of the structure that's the same 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.540
 a secretary button button 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.000
 the other side very easy and very easy 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.240
 to install 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.470
 so here is to installed nacelle 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:51.360
 you will see a big button there 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.390
 it is to remove it in celebration and 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.960
 button 1 to scan end other side that 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.939
 it is to allow to fold in fact the 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.890
 hook 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.009
 so because the basket folds into 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.720
 does all this goes back up and actually these 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:15.220
 also bends take up less space 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:19.750
 so here is the mattress is in fact 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.250
 one does not have to buy the and buttons 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.170
 also and a button of this snack a 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.590
 button on the other side it's for 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:36.460
 allow to lower in fact seizes it 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:40.890
 in fact so especially when you go to 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.890
 that of a salt do not forget about report 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:50.370
 I'd like to drop below 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.370
 here and will bring down 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:03:00.330
 the hanging clung to the box 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:16.269
 as sade is stable to move not that 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:17.640
 this is the basket and this is his stroller 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:25.590
 for the greatest did or so 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:29.470
 so as you see December that falls 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:32.320
 to a handle to put his hands the 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.150
 footrest make up adjustable feet 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.489
 in fact on this side not and the other 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:43.390
 side actually two buttons can go up 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:45.040
 get off the crbc and its ascent 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.390
 to act less than me if I am 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.769
 to show you the limit in photo 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:53.769
 so here is no need to press the 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:04:02.709
 two buttons at the same time hop you 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:04:05.220
 see against the rain so all 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.220
 captives 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:18.870
 we see lapland it's the same 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:21.720
 remove and buttons and a button there and 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.860
 such a side button so it's 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.610
 same time more on both buttons 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.610
 to remove it 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.260
 so here I have withdrawn from a fair side 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:35.360
 to show you so you see as 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:39.979
 it raised it to get the child out 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:45.360
 in order to avoid removing everything so 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:52.550
 very practical life and that's the handle 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:56.610
 is removed here I say more 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:05:03.720
 there is the brake the brake for the 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:14.280
 rear wheels raised is very 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:18.300
 handy to will this be well if he knows 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:21.760
 that changing does not either 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:25.350
 atari a mattress a little sport month 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.350
 just to change the layers 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:36.430
 this could actually hang here 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:39.720
 now she's a repression button 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:49.900
 here on this side actually this side not and 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:53.620
 here is the hooked here is also a 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:55.090
 little trick publicis so at the butcher 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:59.350
 the holes actually where there are wrists 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:01.710
 who settles on we are small catch 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.710
 like that 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.630
 There you go 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.620
 and he wishes to appear there with the button 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.850
 actually sign this with what good 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:31.390
 now I show you how the 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:31.390
 fold it in fact one must be the brake 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:50.330

 buttons here kill them 

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:47.040
