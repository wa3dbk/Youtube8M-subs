00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
style for example my head is facing

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.940

somewhat forward my eyes you can see

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.270 
somewhat forward my eyes you can see
both<00:01:40.250> of<00:01:40.310> my<00:01:40.610> eyes<00:01:40.820> which<00:01:41.120> are<00:01:41.210> facing<00:01:41.600> board

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
both of my eyes which are facing board

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.490 
both of my eyes which are facing board
but<00:01:43.280> my<00:01:43.310> lips<00:01:43.810> while<00:01:44.810> you<00:01:44.960> can<00:01:45.110> see<00:01:45.290> is<00:01:45.380> from

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
but my lips while you can see is from

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:53.780 
but my lips while you can see is from
one<00:01:45.740> side<00:01:46.010> and<00:01:46.040> my<00:01:46.580> nose<00:01:46.850> from<00:01:47.270> one<00:01:47.480> side

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.380 

now<00:01:54.390> that's<00:01:54.810> totally<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.770> mean<00:01:56.370> if<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:57.060> look<00:01:57.240> at

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
now that's totally I mean if you look at

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.870 
now that's totally I mean if you look at
a<00:01:57.450> face<00:01:57.780> from<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.170> side<00:01:58.440> you<00:01:59.070> can<00:01:59.100> only<00:01:59.460> see

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
a face from the side you can only see

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.680 
a face from the side you can only see
one<00:02:00.210> eye<00:02:01.640> so<00:02:02.640> that's<00:02:02.820> what<00:02:02.970> kind<00:02:03.180> of<00:02:03.300> makes<00:02:03.540> it

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690

one eye so that's what kind of makes it
a<00:02:03.810> little<00:02:04.110> abstract<00:02:07.430> now<00:02:08.430> when<00:02:08.580> you're<00:02:08.670> going

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
areas and some oranges now even from

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.140 
areas and some oranges now even from
edge<00:02:38.460> to<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.570> center<00:02:40.020> I<00:02:40.260> am<00:02:41.130> also<00:02:41.460> doing<00:02:41.670> a

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
edge to the center I am also doing a

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.810 
edge to the center I am also doing a
gradual<00:02:42.750> value<00:02:43.110> change<00:02:43.610> she-bears<00:02:44.610> your

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
gradual value change she-bears your

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.970 
gradual value change she-bears your
value<00:02:45.180> change<00:02:45.510> is<00:02:45.959> when<00:02:46.290> you<00:02:46.380> go<00:02:46.560> from<00:02:46.590> light

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
value change is when you go from light

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.530 
value change is when you go from light
to<00:02:47.130> dark<00:02:48.020> by<00:02:49.020> colouring<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.940> way<00:02:51.090> that<00:02:51.270> you<00:02:51.360> do

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
to dark by colouring the way that you do

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.170 
to dark by colouring the way that you do
this<00:02:51.690> is<00:02:51.900> by<00:02:53.150> applying<00:02:54.150> more<00:02:54.690> pressure<00:02:56.120> as<00:02:57.120> you

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
this is by applying more pressure as you

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:18.599 
this is by applying more pressure as you
work<00:02:57.510> away<00:02:58.100> you<00:02:59.100> apply<00:02:59.640> less<00:02:59.850> pressure

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.610 

you<00:03:18.939> see<00:03:19.180> with<00:03:19.299> my<00:03:19.450> eyes<00:03:19.480> there<00:03:20.019> I<00:03:20.049> start<00:03:20.409> off

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
you see with my eyes there I start off

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.399 
you see with my eyes there I start off
with<00:03:20.879> the<00:03:21.879> green<00:03:22.239> and<00:03:22.540> then<00:03:22.659> I'm<00:03:22.750> going<00:03:23.140> back

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:23.409 
with the green and then I'm going back

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:26.099 
with the green and then I'm going back
over<00:03:23.439> with<00:03:24.069> blue<00:03:24.430> I'm<00:03:25.120> learning<00:03:25.719> layering

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
over with blue I'm learning layering

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.380 
over with blue I'm learning layering
color<00:03:26.680> on<00:03:26.890> top<00:03:27.099> of<00:03:27.159> color<00:03:27.280> so<00:03:27.730> therefore<00:03:28.150> it's

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
color on top of color so therefore it's

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.179 
color on top of color so therefore it's
just<00:03:28.540> not<00:03:28.750> one<00:03:29.079> color<00:03:29.379> it<00:03:30.159> gives<00:03:30.579> a<00:03:32.189> little

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:33.189 
just not one color it gives a little

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:35.819 
just not one color it gives a little
effect<00:03:33.750> to<00:03:34.750> what's<00:03:35.079> going<00:03:35.349> on<00:03:35.469> and<00:03:35.650> then<00:03:35.739> I

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
effect to what's going on and then I

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.780 
effect to what's going on and then I
place<00:03:36.099> a<00:03:36.129> little<00:03:36.459> brown<00:03:36.670> in<00:03:36.909> for<00:03:38.430> my<00:03:39.430> stubbly

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
place a little brown in for my stubbly

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:47.039 
place a little brown in for my stubbly
facial<00:03:40.599> hair<00:03:42.209> going<00:03:43.209> over<00:03:43.599> my<00:03:43.780> hair<00:03:46.019> with<00:03:47.019> a

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049

yellow<00:03:47.769> color<00:03:48.129> and<00:03:48.900> going<00:03:49.900> back<00:03:50.409> over<00:03:50.680> it<00:03:51.069> with

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889 
yellow color and going back over it with

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:58.890 
yellow color and going back over it with
brown<00:03:53.889> so<00:03:54.760> that<00:03:54.790> my<00:03:55.209> hair<00:03:55.540> is<00:03:56.189> that<00:03:57.900> dirty

construction paper and you're gonna need

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:39.130 
construction paper and you're gonna need
two<00:05:34.040> different<00:05:34.190> pieces<00:05:34.550> and<00:05:37.510> you<00:05:38.510> need<00:05:38.720> to<00:05:38.870> cut

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:39.140 
two different pieces and you need to cut

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:42.280 
two different pieces and you need to cut
a<00:05:39.350> shape<00:05:40.040> out<00:05:40.490> of<00:05:40.970> one<00:05:41.180> piece<00:05:41.450> I'm<00:05:42.050> gonna

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:42.290 
a shape out of one piece I'm gonna

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:45.730 
a shape out of one piece I'm gonna
choose<00:05:43.510> the<00:05:44.510> brown<00:05:44.780> piece<00:05:45.110> I'm<00:05:45.350> going<00:05:45.530> to<00:05:45.620> do<00:05:45.710> a

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
choose the brown piece I'm going to do a

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.880 
choose the brown piece I'm going to do a
triangle<00:05:46.160> I'm<00:05:47.150> gonna<00:05:47.480> lay<00:05:47.810> it<00:05:47.990> down<00:05:48.050> there<00:05:48.590> so

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:48.890 
triangle I'm gonna lay it down there so

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.510 
triangle I'm gonna lay it down there so
that<00:05:48.920> if<00:05:49.370> it's<00:05:49.670> nice<00:05:50.510> and<00:05:50.840> neat<00:05:51.110> it<00:05:51.980> gives<00:05:52.280> a

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
that if it's nice and neat it gives a

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.470 
that if it's nice and neat it gives a
triangular<00:05:53.510> and<00:05:54.370> angled<00:05:55.370> composition<00:05:56.180> to<00:05:56.330> my

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:56.480 
triangular and angled composition to my

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.860 
triangular and angled composition to my
piece<00:05:57.880> the<00:05:58.880> reason<00:05:59.150> why<00:05:59.240> we're<00:05:59.420> doing<00:05:59.450> this<00:05:59.720> is

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
piece the reason why we're doing this is

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.460 
piece the reason why we're doing this is
because<00:05:59.900> Picasso<00:06:00.890> was<00:06:01.070> known<00:06:01.310> for<00:06:02.470> dissecting

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
because Picasso was known for dissecting

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.560 
because Picasso was known for dissecting
things<00:06:03.980> into<00:06:04.490> shapes<00:06:04.760> if<00:06:04.970> you<00:06:05.120> will<00:06:05.270> get<00:06:05.390> the

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:05.570 
things into shapes if you will get the

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.400 
things into shapes if you will get the
face<00:06:05.810> there<00:06:06.170> you<00:06:06.890> can<00:06:07.130> see<00:06:08.140> many<00:06:09.140> different

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:09.410 
face there you can see many different

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.550 
face there you can see many different
types<00:06:09.740> of<00:06:09.920> shapes<00:06:10.790> that<00:06:11.660> are<00:06:11.840> within<00:06:12.080> that

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
types of shapes that are within that

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.850 
types of shapes that are within that
face<00:06:12.940> and<00:06:14.200> then<00:06:15.200> you're<00:06:15.320> just<00:06:15.440> going<00:06:15.590> to<00:06:15.650> use

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
face and then you're just going to use

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:22.420 
face and then you're just going to use
Elmer's<00:06:16.190> glue<00:06:16.700> to<00:06:17.420> glue<00:06:17.570> it<00:06:17.810> down<00:06:17.990> and<00:06:21.430> the

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 
Elmer's glue to glue it down and the

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:23.890 
Elmer's glue to glue it down and the
same<00:06:22.670> with<00:06:22.880> the<00:06:22.970> head<00:06:23.150> now<00:06:23.330> you<00:06:23.390> don't<00:06:23.690> need<00:06:23.870> a

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:23.900 
same with the head now you don't need a

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.780 
same with the head now you don't need a
lot<00:06:24.110> of<00:06:24.140> Elmer's<00:06:24.590> glue<00:06:24.830> you<00:06:25.400> just<00:06:25.610> need<00:06:25.760> enough

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:25.790 
lot of Elmer's glue you just need enough

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:28.180
