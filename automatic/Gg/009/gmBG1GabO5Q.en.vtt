00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.730
 when you see it, you feel it must be yours 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.099
 but this is just the end of our 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.720
 history the shoe is the result of a 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:21.950
 complex and laborious process 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.950
 let's go to the beginning 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.360
 everything starts with a line design and 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.820
 functionality find the balance 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.070
 perfect on paper the designer 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.930
 draw the shapes choose colors and 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.590
 materials taking into account the 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.059
 emerging styles and trends after 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.040
 define the collection you have to manufacture 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.820
 the forms on which they will be built 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.199
 the shoes create standards is a trade 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.120
 what happens from parents to children 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:52.739
 It takes a lot of experience and 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.780
 knowledge of anthropometry and 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.980
 ergonomics of the foot to create a good 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.960
 functional and comfortable oven from 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.390
 prototype with the help of programs 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.330
 computer forms and scaled 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.009
 controls the correct duplicate these 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.350
 will be the forms that will be used 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.350
 during the process of assembling the shoe 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.009
 the heel is the other fundamental part of 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.810
 the structure of the shoe from a 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:22.030
 wooden block is carved a model 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.520
 artisanal and with the help of the latest 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.140
 technologies the mold that 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.180
 will be used to manufacture the 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.180
 heels injected in plastic 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.220
 which will be covered in leather cloth or 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.940
 tampography will simulate any 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:39.340
 texture that the designer has imagined 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.750
 meanwhile the pattern maker must 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.270
 get a two-dimensional drawing 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.750
 that fits perfectly to a 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.850
 Three-dimensional shape is necessary to assemble 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.420
 several prototypes and test them up 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.640
 define the perfect pattern the skin is 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.530
 a very valuable raw material and it 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.470
 undergoes rigorous quality controls 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.720
 for this it is necessary to select each 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:05.170
 piece and check the centimeter to 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.970
 centimeter the pattern and this scale to the 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.259
 different sizes that will be used 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.959
 during the cutting process 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.810
 Each type of skin is cut using a 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.610
 different procedure in some cases 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.700
 It is cut with dies or machines 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.189
 automatic however in others the 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.659
 Expert hands of the cutter perform the 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:29.700
 Cut with extreme precision the pieces 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:31.620
 they arrive at the section of aparado where 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.980
 can produce more than 100 processes 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.140
 different ornaments are prepared and 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.870
 accessories the parts of the shovel and the 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.690
 lining and sewing everything necessary until 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.250
 get what we call the cut the 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.260
 shoemaker can start manufacturing 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.239
 of the shoe that is subjected to a 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.000
 rigorous quality control contrasted 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.590
 the cut is placed on the last and 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.450
 new must go through numerous 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.370
 processes in which the 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.639
 craft tradition with the latest 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.639
 technologies 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.870
 the heel is mounted on the heel and the 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.030
 French heat is applied and make up 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.489
 Gently seams and other parts 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.989
 of the cut so that this one adjusts to the 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.989
 it perfectly 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.790
 the folds and irregularities are chosen 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.250
 from the outside of the plant to 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:25.670
 can stick the sole which is sewn 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:28.550
 machine and in some models by hand 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:33.130
 in women's shoes the heel sticks 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.130
 and sticks to then paste the sole 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.860
 with exquisite care shoe is gaining 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.780
 its definitive form but still remains 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.920
 work ahead so you're 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:47.350
 perfectly finished with extreme care 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.170
 the final touches are given to the shoes 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:54.480
 they are cleaned and embellished and so the 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.480
 Manufacturing process is almost over 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.270
 expert staff supervises the millimeter 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.310
 each piece so that everything is ready 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.320
 before our shoes are 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.800
 distribute in stores around the 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.800
 world 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.260
 the passion for quality the excellent 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:17.259
 artisan work attached to the incessant 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.419
 search for innovation fashion 

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:21.519
 Value of our personality design 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:24.160
 of our brands and extreme care 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.280
 in the selection of materials do 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.479
 that the Spanish shoes are today 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.310
 authentic objects of desire in the 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.310
 showcases around the world
