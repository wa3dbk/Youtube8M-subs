this<00:00:03.560> video<00:00:03.949> is<00:00:04.190> about<00:00:04.400> knowing<00:00:04.700> when<00:00:05.210> to

00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:05.569 
this video is about knowing when to

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:08.170 
this video is about knowing when to
change<00:00:05.990> your<00:00:06.229> filter<00:00:06.380> and<00:00:06.939> that<00:00:07.939> question

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:08.180 
change your filter and that question

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.549 
change your filter and that question
comes<00:00:08.510> up<00:00:08.630> a<00:00:08.750> lot<00:00:08.900> at<00:00:09.050> the<00:00:09.110> waterfilters.net

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:09.559 
comes up a lot at the waterfilters.net

filter

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:12.980 
filter

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.579 
filter
it's<00:00:13.190> the<00:00:13.629> $64,000<00:00:14.629> question<00:00:14.749> and

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:15.589 
it's the $64,000 question and

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:17.470 
it's the $64,000 question and
unfortunately<00:00:16.250> it<00:00:16.460> doesn't<00:00:16.820> have<00:00:16.970> a<00:00:17.000> super

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:17.480 
unfortunately it doesn't have a super

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.270 
unfortunately it doesn't have a super
easy<00:00:17.869> answer<00:00:18.410> but<00:00:18.680> I'm<00:00:18.800> going<00:00:18.920> to<00:00:18.980> try<00:00:19.160> and

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:19.280 
easy answer but I'm going to try and

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.380 
easy answer but I'm going to try and
simplify<00:00:19.760> it<00:00:19.820> for<00:00:20.090> you

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
simplify it for you

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.410 
simplify it for you
you<00:00:20.750> see<00:00:20.960> filter<00:00:21.680> life<00:00:22.310> is<00:00:22.670> determined<00:00:22.880> by<00:00:23.360> two

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
you see filter life is determined by two

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.470 
you see filter life is determined by two
variables<00:00:23.960> one<00:00:24.710> is<00:00:24.920> how<00:00:25.460> much<00:00:25.610> contaminant<00:00:26.390> is

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
variables one is how much contaminant is

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.380 
variables one is how much contaminant is
in<00:00:26.630> your<00:00:26.750> water<00:00:26.960> this<00:00:27.830> filter<00:00:28.310> is<00:00:29.120> going<00:00:29.300> to

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
in your water this filter is going to

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.960 
in your water this filter is going to
last<00:00:29.600> a<00:00:29.840> lot<00:00:30.080> longer<00:00:30.140> in<00:00:30.770> a<00:00:31.040> water<00:00:31.280> supply<00:00:31.550> that

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
last a lot longer in a water supply that

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.049 
last a lot longer in a water supply that
has<00:00:32.029> very<00:00:32.540> low<00:00:32.870> sediment<00:00:33.559> compared<00:00:34.190> to<00:00:34.430> let's

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
has very low sediment compared to let's

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:37.209 
has very low sediment compared to let's
say<00:00:35.359> a<00:00:35.570> well<00:00:35.899> water<00:00:36.230> that<00:00:36.410> was<00:00:36.769> just<00:00:36.800> drilled

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
say a well water that was just drilled

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.599 
say a well water that was just drilled
recently<00:00:38.149> that's<00:00:38.629> gushing<00:00:39.410> up<00:00:39.559> loads<00:00:39.920> of<00:00:40.219> sand

00:00:40.599 --> 00:00:40.609 
recently that's gushing up loads of sand

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:42.790 
recently that's gushing up loads of sand
and<00:00:40.909> crud<00:00:41.179> that<00:00:41.510> guy<00:00:42.379> is<00:00:42.440> going<00:00:42.649> to<00:00:42.710> be

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
and crud that guy is going to be

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.290 
and crud that guy is going to be
changing<00:00:43.190> this<00:00:43.339> filter<00:00:43.730> much<00:00:43.999> more

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
changing this filter much more

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.849 
changing this filter much more
frequently<00:00:44.809> than<00:00:45.170> someone<00:00:45.620> with<00:00:45.739> a<00:00:45.769> low

00:00:45.849 --> 00:00:45.859 
frequently than someone with a low

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:48.399 
frequently than someone with a low
sediment<00:00:46.550> situation<00:00:47.179> so<00:00:47.839> the<00:00:47.960> amount<00:00:48.289> of

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:48.409 
sediment situation so the amount of

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:50.349 
sediment situation so the amount of
contaminant<00:00:49.159> in<00:00:49.280> the<00:00:49.370> water<00:00:49.550> is<00:00:49.760> one<00:00:49.789> variable

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:50.359 
contaminant in the water is one variable

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:52.689 
contaminant in the water is one variable
the<00:00:50.839> other<00:00:50.960> variable<00:00:51.499> is<00:00:51.589> how<00:00:52.039> much<00:00:52.190> water<00:00:52.460> are

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
the other variable is how much water are

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.119 
the other variable is how much water are
you<00:00:52.819> actually<00:00:53.089> using<00:00:53.929> how<00:00:54.469> many<00:00:54.620> people<00:00:54.979> live

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
you actually using how many people live

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.520 
you actually using how many people live
in<00:00:55.219> the<00:00:55.309> home<00:00:55.519> how<00:00:56.059> many<00:00:56.239> restrooms<00:00:57.079> are<00:00:57.319> there

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
in the home how many restrooms are there

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.979 
in the home how many restrooms are there
how<00:00:57.979> much<00:00:58.219> water<00:00:58.729> is<00:00:58.969> actually<00:00:59.239> going<00:00:59.780> through

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
how much water is actually going through

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.889 
how much water is actually going through
this<00:01:00.979> filter<00:01:01.399> cartridge<00:01:01.789> on<00:01:02.329> a<00:01:02.389> daily<00:01:02.870> weekly

monthly<00:01:03.350> basis<00:01:03.889> and<00:01:04.040> that<00:01:04.100> varies<00:01:04.909> from

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
monthly basis and that varies from

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.170 
monthly basis and that varies from
situation<00:01:05.300> to<00:01:05.690> situation<00:01:06.009> so<00:01:07.009> to<00:01:07.250> take<00:01:07.969> the

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
after each of your filter housings this

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.779 
after each of your filter housings this
will<00:01:18.079> give<00:01:18.259> you<00:01:18.439> a<00:01:18.469> before<00:01:18.829> will<00:01:19.490> give<00:01:19.640> you<00:01:19.759> a

will give you a before will give you a

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:22.330 
will give you a before will give you a
baseline<00:01:20.270> number<00:01:20.810> this<00:01:21.320> is<00:01:21.380> X<00:01:21.860> number<00:01:22.310> of

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
baseline number this is X number of

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.069 
baseline number this is X number of
pressure<00:01:22.640> let's<00:01:22.939> say<00:01:23.119> that<00:01:23.270> this<00:01:23.420> Inlet<00:01:23.869> side

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:24.079 
pressure let's say that this Inlet side

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:27.219 
pressure let's say that this Inlet side
reads<00:01:24.490> 60<00:01:25.520> that's<00:01:26.030> a<00:01:26.180> nice<00:01:26.450> Inlet<00:01:26.960> pressure

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
reads 60 that's a nice Inlet pressure

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.440 
reads 60 that's a nice Inlet pressure
and<00:01:27.740> going<00:01:28.399> through<00:01:28.640> a<00:01:28.670> sediment<00:01:29.270> cartridge

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
and going through a sediment cartridge

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.959 
and going through a sediment cartridge
something<00:01:30.200> like<00:01:30.380> this<00:01:30.590> a<00:01:30.860> pleated<00:01:31.340> non

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:31.969 
something like this a pleated non

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:34.480 
something like this a pleated non
cellulose<00:01:32.659> polyester<00:01:33.320> cartridge<00:01:33.799> you<00:01:34.280> might

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
cellulose polyester cartridge you might

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.120 
cellulose polyester cartridge you might
see<00:01:34.759> a<00:01:34.789> pressure<00:01:35.210> loss<00:01:35.479> of<00:01:35.810> two<00:01:36.109> psi<00:01:36.799> with<00:01:37.100> a

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
see a pressure loss of two psi with a

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.340 
see a pressure loss of two psi with a
brand<00:01:37.399> new<00:01:37.490> cartridge<00:01:38.060> that<00:01:38.299> number<00:01:39.170> will

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
brand new cartridge that number will

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.889 
brand new cartridge that number will
increase<00:01:39.560> and<00:01:40.219> so<00:01:40.280> you<00:01:40.820> started<00:01:41.240> out<00:01:41.329> at<00:01:41.450> 60

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
increase and so you started out at 60

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.020 
increase and so you started out at 60
over<00:01:42.109> here<00:01:42.259> you're<00:01:42.409> 58<00:01:42.829> then<00:01:43.640> you<00:01:43.820> come<00:01:44.000> back

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
over here you're 58 then you come back

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.990 
over here you're 58 then you come back
three<00:01:44.539> weeks<00:01:44.570> later<00:01:45.020> and<00:01:45.259> it<00:01:45.350> reads<00:01:45.530> 57<00:01:46.460> you

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
three weeks later and it reads 57 you

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.060 
three weeks later and it reads 57 you
come<00:01:47.210> back<00:01:47.329> a<00:01:47.390> month<00:01:47.689> later<00:01:47.810> and<00:01:48.109> it<00:01:48.289> reads<00:01:48.530> 50

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
come back a month later and it reads 50

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.429 
come back a month later and it reads 50
and<00:01:49.460> you<00:01:50.299> come<00:01:50.509> back<00:01:50.659> a<00:01:50.689> couple<00:01:50.810> more<00:01:51.170> weeks

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
and you come back a couple more weeks

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.260 
and you come back a couple more weeks
later<00:01:51.710> maybe<00:01:51.920> I<00:01:52.100> mean<00:01:52.340> who<00:01:52.520> knows<00:01:52.729> it's<00:01:53.060> that

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
later maybe I mean who knows it's that

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.459 
later maybe I mean who knows it's that
you<00:01:53.390> know<00:01:53.479> we<00:01:53.689> don't<00:01:53.780> know<00:01:53.960> how<00:01:54.109> long<00:01:54.320> it's

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:54.469 
you know we don't know how long it's

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
going to be but eventually your pressure

going to be but eventually your pressure
lost<00:01:56.630> me<00:01:56.960> about<00:01:57.170> 15<00:01:57.710> to<00:01:57.859> 20<00:01:58.189> psi<00:01:58.490> so<00:01:58.909> it<00:01:58.999> was<00:01:59.090> 60

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
lost me about 15 to 20 psi so it was 60

the 40 psi over here you're probably

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.419 
the 40 psi over here you're probably
going<00:02:06.109> to<00:02:06.170> get<00:02:06.289> in<00:02:06.439> the<00:02:06.499> shower<00:02:06.710> some<00:02:07.219> night

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
and go oh where is my water pressure

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.149 
and go oh where is my water pressure
that's<00:02:11.450> your<00:02:11.780> clue<00:02:12.019> but<00:02:12.230> you<00:02:12.290> can<00:02:12.500> read<00:02:12.800> it<00:02:13.010> on

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:13.159 
that's your clue but you can read it on

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:15.089 
that's your clue but you can read it on
the<00:02:13.340> gauges<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:13.879> know<00:02:14.120> ahead<00:02:14.450> of<00:02:14.720> time

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
the gauges and know ahead of time
