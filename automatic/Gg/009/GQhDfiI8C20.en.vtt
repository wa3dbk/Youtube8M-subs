and this device is actually a developer

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.400 
and this device is actually a developer
prototype<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:41.489> this<00:00:41.879> thing<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.239> not<00:00:43.079> never

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
prototype so this thing is not never

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.510 
prototype so this thing is not never
going<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.649> make<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.980> market<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.399> this

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
going to make it to market in this

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.029 
going to make it to market in this
configuration<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.660> I'll<00:00:46.260> show<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.559> why<00:00:46.829> in<00:00:46.980> a

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
configuration and I'll show you why in a

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.369 
configuration and I'll show you why in a
second<00:00:47.430> because<00:00:48.059> in<00:00:48.360> here<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:48.960> have<00:00:49.140> pretty

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
second because in here you have pretty

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.479 
second because in here you have pretty
much<00:00:49.410> everything<00:00:49.530> that's<00:00:50.070> nice<00:00:50.309> and

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
much everything that's nice and

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.610 
much everything that's nice and
expensive<00:00:50.700> right<00:00:51.120> now<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:51.870> get<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.079> 10.1

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
expensive right now so you get a 10.1

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.709 
expensive right now so you get a 10.1

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.209 
inch 2560 x 1440 pixel IPS panel and the
device<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.140> actually<00:00:58.320> already<00:00:58.710> running

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
device is actually already running

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.459 
device is actually already running
android<00:00:59.910> 4.4<00:01:00.449> which<00:01:00.899> i'm<00:01:01.050> going<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.230> show<00:01:01.440> you

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
android 4.4 which i'm going to show you

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.000 
android 4.4 which i'm going to show you
right<00:01:02.250> there<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:03.510> that's<00:01:03.809> android<00:01:04.140> 4.4<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.799> in

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
right there so that's android 4.4 it in

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.440 
right there so that's android 4.4 it in
there<00:01:07.130> there's<00:01:08.130> four<00:01:08.520> gigs<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.850> ram<00:01:09.000> in<00:01:09.180> here

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
there there's four gigs of ram in here

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.730 
there there's four gigs of ram in here
plus<00:01:10.610> actually<00:01:11.720> 64-bit<00:01:12.720> support<00:01:12.869> so<00:01:13.350> this<00:01:13.530> is

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
plus actually 64-bit support so this is

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.429 
plus actually 64-bit support so this is
really<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.430> nice<00:01:14.790> device<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.900> ship<00:01:16.320> is

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
really a nice device and the ship is

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.410 
really a nice device and the ship is
going<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.740> show<00:01:16.890> up<00:01:17.070> over<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.729> next<00:01:17.850> year<00:01:18.270> and

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
going to show up over the next year and

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.690 
going to show up over the next year and
a<00:01:18.840> bunch<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.290> mobile<00:01:19.799> devices<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.310> it's<00:01:20.520> going

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
a bunch of mobile devices and it's going

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.190 
a bunch of mobile devices and it's going
to<00:01:20.790> open<00:01:21.030> up<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.420> whole<00:01:21.630> new<00:01:21.659> level<00:01:21.960> of

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
to open up a whole new level of

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.010 
to open up a whole new level of
performance<00:01:22.740> because<00:01:23.659> Qualcomm<00:01:24.659> has<00:01:24.780> working

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
performance because Qualcomm has working

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.359 
performance because Qualcomm has working
and<00:01:25.290> has<00:01:25.380> been<00:01:25.500> working<00:01:25.619> on<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.040> graphics

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
and has been working on the graphics

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.850 
and has been working on the graphics
part<00:01:26.610> plus<00:01:26.820> you'll<00:01:27.060> get<00:01:27.330> 64-bit<00:01:28.080> support<00:01:28.200> with

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
part plus you'll get 64-bit support with

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.630 
part plus you'll get 64-bit support with
for<00:01:29.189> example<00:01:29.280> 4<00:01:29.880> gigs<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.240> RAM<00:01:30.390> in<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:30.900> tablet

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
for example 4 gigs of RAM in this tablet

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.920 
for example 4 gigs of RAM in this tablet
let's<00:01:32.640> take<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.820> quick<00:01:33.000> look<00:01:33.030> around<00:01:33.210> we<00:01:33.509> have<00:01:33.720> a

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
let's take a quick look around we have a

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.149 
let's take a quick look around we have a
home<00:01:34.110> button<00:01:34.290> down<00:01:34.470> here<00:01:34.500> which<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.009> not

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
home button down here which is not

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.800 
home button down here which is not
working<00:01:35.670> right<00:01:35.700> now<00:01:35.820> because<00:01:36.240> they're<00:01:36.420> using

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
working right now because they're using

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.290 
working right now because they're using
the<00:01:37.140> android<00:01:37.590> 4.4<00:01:38.009> on-screen<00:01:38.610> buttons

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
the android 4.4 on-screen buttons

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.050 
the android 4.4 on-screen buttons
we<00:01:41.050> have<00:01:41.260> I<00:01:41.620> think<00:01:41.950> that<00:01:42.100> it's<00:01:42.250> a<00:01:42.310> 5-megapixel

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
we have I think that it's a 5-megapixel

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.520 
we have I think that it's a 5-megapixel
are<00:01:43.180> you<00:01:43.270> more<00:01:43.540> on<00:01:44.020> camera<00:01:44.350> right<00:01:44.470> here

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
are you more on camera right here

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.260 
are you more on camera right here
there's<00:01:45.190> a<00:01:45.250> bunch<00:01:45.400> of<00:01:45.520> sensors<00:01:45.670> up<00:01:45.940> here<00:01:46.120> this

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
there's a bunch of sensors up here this

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.670 
there's a bunch of sensors up here this
as<00:01:46.450> I<00:01:46.630> said<00:01:46.810> there's<00:01:46.990> pretty<00:01:47.140> much<00:01:47.200> everything

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
as I said there's pretty much everything

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.410 
as I said there's pretty much everything
in<00:01:47.800> there<00:01:47.950> that's<00:01:48.190> really<00:01:48.760> expensive<00:01:48.940> and

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
in there that's really expensive and

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.240 
in there that's really expensive and
that<00:01:49.570> you<00:01:49.690> would<00:01:49.900> want<00:01:50.080> or<00:01:50.530> could<00:01:50.860> possibly

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
that you would want or could possibly

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.120 
that you would want or could possibly
build<00:01:51.490> into<00:01:51.820> a<00:01:51.850> tablet<00:01:52.270> like<00:01:52.420> this<00:01:52.980> let's<00:01:53.980> go

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
build into a tablet like this let's go

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.490 
build into a tablet like this let's go
on<00:01:54.280> to<00:01:54.430> the<00:01:54.460> right<00:01:54.640> we<00:01:55.210> have<00:01:55.240> an<00:01:55.720> SD<00:01:55.960> card<00:01:56.110> slot

so this is the internals of the device

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.100 
so this is the internals of the device
the<00:02:59.010> 805<00:02:59.459> is<00:02:59.610> somewhere<00:02:59.849> back<00:03:00.030> here<00:03:00.110> obviously

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
the 805 is somewhere back here obviously

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.259 
the 805 is somewhere back here obviously
covered<00:03:01.739> by<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.010> heatsink<00:03:02.430> and<00:03:02.580> you<00:03:03.090> have<00:03:03.239> a
