here's<00:00:08.390> the<00:00:08.570> setup<00:00:08.780> we're<00:00:09.050> going<00:00:09.230> to<00:00:09.320> use

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:09.470 
here's the setup we're going to use

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.840 
here's the setup we're going to use
today<00:00:10.059> static<00:00:11.059> generator<00:00:12.340> connected<00:00:13.340> to<00:00:13.670> it

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:25.669 
magnets on the side here you can see

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:28.839 
magnets on the side here you can see
there's<00:00:25.910> hardly<00:00:26.180> any<00:00:27.369> movement<00:00:28.369> there<00:00:28.550> with

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
there's hardly any movement there with

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:30.280 
there's hardly any movement there with
the<00:00:29.000> magnet<00:00:29.390> although<00:00:29.750> the<00:00:29.899> compass<00:00:30.200> is

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:30.290 
the magnet although the compass is

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:35.139 
the magnet although the compass is
moving<00:00:30.710> here's<00:00:31.460> our<00:00:31.640> setup<00:00:33.820> okay<00:00:34.820> here<00:00:35.090> you

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:35.149 
moving here's our setup okay here you

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:36.880 
moving here's our setup okay here you
can<00:00:35.300> see<00:00:35.510> I<00:00:35.540> have<00:00:35.720> a<00:00:35.870> string<00:00:36.200> tied<00:00:36.410> to<00:00:36.470> the<00:00:36.710> roof

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
can see I have a string tied to the roof

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.490 
can see I have a string tied to the roof
that<00:00:37.220> comes<00:00:37.790> down<00:00:38.090> and<00:00:38.540> that's<00:00:39.109> what<00:00:39.379> this

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
that comes down and that's what this

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.470 
that comes down and that's what this
center<00:00:39.890> disk<00:00:40.100> is<00:00:40.280> hanging<00:00:40.640> on<00:00:40.760> just<00:00:41.329> in<00:00:41.420> case

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
center disk is hanging on just in case

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.840 
center disk is hanging on just in case
somebody<00:00:41.960> thinks<00:00:42.199> I'm<00:00:42.320> moving<00:00:42.649> it<00:00:42.769> by<00:00:42.920> hand

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.630 

okay<00:00:46.850> here<00:00:47.120> we<00:00:47.149> have<00:00:47.739> still<00:00:48.739> shot<00:00:49.039> here<00:00:49.370> just

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
okay here we have still shot here just

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.819 
okay here we have still shot here just
to<00:00:49.760> show<00:00:49.940> you<00:00:49.969> kind<00:00:50.449> of<00:00:50.539> the<00:00:50.600> disks<00:00:50.989> here<00:00:51.170> to

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
to show you kind of the disks here to

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:53.139 
to show you kind of the disks here to
let<00:00:51.980> you<00:00:52.129> know<00:00:52.160> that<00:00:52.309> I<00:00:52.670> any<00:00:52.850> of<00:00:52.999> my

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
let you know that I any of my

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.439 
let you know that I any of my
experiments<00:00:53.629> are<00:00:53.989> not<00:00:54.550> done<00:00:55.550> with<00:00:55.730> Trix<00:00:56.059> Trix

experiments are not done with Trix Trix

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:59.380 
experiments are not done with Trix Trix
are<00:00:56.989> for<00:00:57.050> kids<00:00:57.230> I<00:00:57.620> believe<00:00:57.920> and<00:00:58.219> all<00:00:59.149> I'm

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
are for kids I believe and all I'm

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.119 
are for kids I believe and all I'm
trying<00:00:59.629> to<00:00:59.659> do<00:00:59.809> is<00:00:59.989> find<00:01:00.230> out<00:01:00.440> here<00:01:00.800> a

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
trying to do is find out here a

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:03.310 
trying to do is find out here a
correlation<00:01:01.820> between<00:01:01.850> magnetism<00:01:02.719> static

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
correlation between magnetism static

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.590 
correlation between magnetism static
electricity<00:01:03.710> and<00:01:04.129> perhaps<00:01:04.400> a<00:01:04.820> vortex<00:01:05.420> or

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
electricity and perhaps a vortex or

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.350 
electricity and perhaps a vortex or
rotating<00:01:06.200> electrons<00:01:06.710> let's<00:01:07.550> give<00:01:07.790> her<00:01:07.880> a<00:01:07.940> go

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
rotating electrons let's give her a go

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.690 
rotating electrons let's give her a go
okay<00:01:10.050> here<00:01:10.380> I'm<00:01:10.530> just<00:01:10.560> going<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.890> turn<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
okay here I'm just going to turn the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.400 
okay here I'm just going to turn the
static<00:01:12.030> generator<00:01:12.420> on<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.930> negative<00:01:13.380> side

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410 
static generator on the negative side

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.230 
static generator on the negative side
and<00:01:13.980> see<00:01:14.190> if<00:01:14.280> there's<00:01:14.430> anything<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.850> happens

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
and see if there's anything that happens

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.870 
and see if there's anything that happens
to<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.450> compass<00:01:15.810> let's<00:01:16.650> watch<00:01:16.920> there<00:01:17.550> it<00:01:17.700> goes

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
to the compass let's watch there it goes

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.140 
to the compass let's watch there it goes
one<00:01:18.420> turn<00:01:18.800> so<00:01:19.800> there<00:01:19.950> seems<00:01:20.160> to<00:01:20.460> be<00:01:20.580> some<00:01:21.120> type

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
one turn so there seems to be some type

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.780 
one turn so there seems to be some type
of<00:01:21.330> magnetism<00:01:22.130> happening<00:01:23.130> by<00:01:23.250> charging<00:01:23.700> that

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
of magnetism happening by charging that

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.790 
of magnetism happening by charging that

my<00:01:26.370> research<00:01:26.730> and<00:01:26.940> static<00:01:27.270> electricity<00:01:27.360> has

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
my research and static electricity has

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.910 
my research and static electricity has
shown<00:01:28.410> that<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.830> can<00:01:28.860> charge<00:01:29.340> two<00:01:30.920> surfaces

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
shown that you can charge two surfaces

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.220 
shown that you can charge two surfaces
one<00:01:32.190> positively<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.150> one<00:01:33.420> negatively<00:01:34.050> and

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:34.230 
one positively and one negatively and

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.400 
one positively and one negatively and
have<00:01:34.800> something<00:01:35.220> in<00:01:35.340> between<00:01:35.750> that<00:01:36.750> can<00:01:37.110> take

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
have something in between that can take

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.290 
have something in between that can take
and<00:01:37.650> transfer<00:01:38.130> those<00:01:38.280> charges<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.120> that

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
and transfer those charges so that

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.510 
and transfer those charges so that
starts<00:01:39.690> out<00:01:39.810> neutral<00:01:40.410> and<00:01:40.620> then<00:01:41.220> as<00:01:41.370> it

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
starts out neutral and then as it

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.130 
starts out neutral and then as it
becomes<00:01:41.790> charge<00:01:42.150> negative<00:01:42.480> it<00:01:42.870> will<00:01:42.990> move

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
becomes charge negative it will move

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.900 
becomes charge negative it will move
towards<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.680> positive<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.310> back<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.640> forth

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910 
towards the positive and back and forth

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.200 
towards the positive and back and forth
or<00:01:45.150> as<00:01:45.930> we<00:01:46.080> say<00:01:46.110> static<00:01:46.680> ping-pong<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.730> guess<00:01:47.970> so

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
or as we say static ping-pong I guess so

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.450 
or as we say static ping-pong I guess so
let's<00:01:48.870> give<00:01:49.050> it<00:01:49.080> a<00:01:49.200> try<00:01:49.350> here<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:49.890> see<00:01:50.310> what

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
let's give it a try here and see what

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.770 
let's give it a try here and see what
happens

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.430 

okay<00:01:56.549> going<00:01:57.549> to<00:01:57.640> start<00:01:57.909> out<00:01:58.060> here<00:01:58.330> just<00:01:59.320> going

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
okay going to start out here just going

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.830 
okay going to start out here just going
to<00:01:59.530> set<00:01:59.740> these<00:01:59.920> straight<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:01.479> I'm<00:02:01.600> going<00:02:01.780> to

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
to set these straight and I'm going to

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.760 
to set these straight and I'm going to
crank<00:02:02.020> over<00:02:02.260> the<00:02:02.470> generator

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.910 

have<00:02:09.770> a<00:02:09.860> look<00:02:10.010> at<00:02:10.130> what<00:02:10.280> happens<00:02:11.620> if<00:02:12.620> i<00:02:12.710> give<00:02:12.890> it

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
have a look at what happens if i give it

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.970 
have a look at what happens if i give it
too<00:02:13.130> many<00:02:13.340> volts<00:02:13.610> it<00:02:14.240> doesn't<00:02:14.540> work<00:02:14.660> properly

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
too many volts it doesn't work properly

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.060 
too many volts it doesn't work properly
which<00:02:15.980> is<00:02:16.130> likes<00:02:16.340> a<00:02:16.460> particular<00:02:16.760> amount<00:02:18.070> watch

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
which is likes a particular amount watch

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.360 
which is likes a particular amount watch
the<00:02:19.250> compass<00:02:19.610> underneath

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.509 

although<00:02:25.060> a<00:02:25.090> little<00:02:25.269> hard<00:02:25.569> to<00:02:25.690> see<00:02:26.519> the

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
although a little hard to see the

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.470 
although a little hard to see the
compass<00:02:27.879> as<00:02:28.030> well<00:02:28.269> being<00:02:29.140> affected

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.340 

I'm<00:02:32.989> going<00:02:33.140> to<00:02:33.200> stop<00:02:33.470> turning<00:02:33.800> now

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
I'm going to stop turning now

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.420 
I'm going to stop turning now
the<00:02:35.860> generator<00:02:36.340> and<00:02:36.550> you<00:02:36.610> can<00:02:36.760> see

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
the generator and you can see

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.410 
the generator and you can see
the<00:02:38.939> still<00:02:39.180> charged<00:02:39.480> apparent

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.750 

well<00:02:45.420> by<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:45.990> first<00:02:46.290> experiment<00:02:46.770> the<00:02:47.490> way<00:02:47.610> the

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
well by the first experiment the way the

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.880 
well by the first experiment the way the
compass<00:02:48.120> moved<00:02:48.390> it<00:02:48.930> looks<00:02:49.170> like<00:02:49.410> that<00:02:49.650> that

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
compass moved it looks like that that

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.550 
compass moved it looks like that that
plate<00:02:50.730> there<00:02:51.090> has<00:02:51.420> some<00:02:51.690> magnetic<00:02:51.960> properties

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
plate there has some magnetic properties

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.920 
plate there has some magnetic properties
to<00:02:52.740> it<00:02:52.850> but<00:02:53.850> we<00:02:53.970> need<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.210> find<00:02:54.450> out<00:02:54.630> if<00:02:54.780> that's

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
to it but we need to find out if that's

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.320 
to it but we need to find out if that's
true<00:02:55.110> or<00:02:55.650> is<00:02:55.890> that<00:02:56.070> the<00:02:56.130> compass<00:02:56.970> is<00:02:57.090> just

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
true or is that the compass is just

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.440 
true or is that the compass is just
becoming<00:02:57.630> charged<00:02:58.200> statically<00:02:58.800> so<00:02:59.670> now<00:02:59.850> we

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
becoming charged statically so now we

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.570 
becoming charged statically so now we
need<00:03:00.600> to<00:03:00.630> use<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:00.870> coil<00:03:01.260> in<00:03:01.470> here<00:03:01.740> and<00:03:02.160> see<00:03:02.400> if<00:03:02.430> we

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
need to use a coil in here and see if we

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.040 
need to use a coil in here and see if we
can<00:03:02.700> pick<00:03:02.910> up<00:03:02.940> something<00:03:03.300> happening<00:03:03.840> or<00:03:04.020> a

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
can pick up something happening or a

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.130 
can pick up something happening or a
changing<00:03:04.530> magnetic<00:03:04.650> field<00:03:05.190> using<00:03:05.430> a<00:03:05.610> coil<00:03:06.140> the

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
changing magnetic field using a coil the

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.930 
changing magnetic field using a coil the
movement<00:03:07.530> of<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.680> compass<00:03:08.070> also<00:03:08.400> shows<00:03:08.700> that

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
movement of the compass also shows that

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.760 
movement of the compass also shows that
according<00:03:09.330> to<00:03:09.420> Hans<00:03:09.660> Koehler<00:03:10.050> that<00:03:10.650> the

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
according to Hans Koehler that the

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.950 
according to Hans Koehler that the
electron<00:03:11.130> is<00:03:11.250> a<00:03:11.280> South<00:03:11.520> Pole<00:03:11.850> thus<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:12.750> North

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
electron is a South Pole thus the North

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.410 
electron is a South Pole thus the North
Pole<00:03:13.260> of<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.980> compass<00:03:14.460> is<00:03:14.610> attracting<00:03:15.210> to<00:03:15.330> the

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
Pole of the compass is attracting to the

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
Pole of the compass is attracting to the
plate<00:03:18.710> going<00:03:19.710> to<00:03:19.890> our<00:03:20.010> ping<00:03:20.580> pong<00:03:21.140> device<00:03:22.140> here

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
plate going to our ping pong device here

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.460 
plate going to our ping pong device here
that<00:03:22.650> was<00:03:22.800> a<00:03:22.830> fun<00:03:23.550> experiment<00:03:24.000> I<00:03:24.440> have<00:03:25.440> a

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
that was a fun experiment I have a

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.590 
that was a fun experiment I have a
another<00:03:26.070> picture<00:03:26.490> here<00:03:26.730> and<00:03:26.760> well<00:03:27.060> this<00:03:27.450> is

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
another picture here and well this is

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.050 
another picture here and well this is
basically<00:03:28.410> where<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.710> foam<00:03:29.190> pack<00:03:29.490> started

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
basically where the foam pack started

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.820 
basically where the foam pack started
out<00:03:30.180> before<00:03:30.870> we<00:03:30.960> started<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.410> ping<00:03:31.590> pong

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
out before we started the ping pong

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.830 
out before we started the ping pong
let's<00:03:32.760> see<00:03:32.910> how<00:03:33.060> much<00:03:33.240> those<00:03:33.450> puppies

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
let's see how much those puppies

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:42.880 
let's see how much those puppies
actually<00:03:34.200> moved

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.950
