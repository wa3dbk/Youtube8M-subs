00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
door trim right here is going to be

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.090 
door trim right here is going to be
faded<00:01:46.030> so<00:01:46.750> I<00:01:46.780> actually<00:01:46.990> had<00:01:47.260> mine<00:01:47.500> taken<00:01:47.710> off

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
faded so I actually had mine taken off

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.980 
faded so I actually had mine taken off
and<00:01:48.310> paint<00:01:48.640> it<00:01:48.790> because<00:01:49.210> I<00:01:49.570> don't<00:01:49.930> think

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
and paint it because I don't think

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.090 
and paint it because I don't think
they're<00:01:50.260> actually<00:01:50.350> paint<00:01:50.740> it<00:01:50.860> from<00:01:50.950> the

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
they're actually paint it from the

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.500 
they're actually paint it from the
factory<00:01:51.430> I<00:01:51.610> think<00:01:51.850> they're<00:01:51.940> just<00:01:52.120> molded

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
factory I think they're just molded

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.690 
factory I think they're just molded
plastic<00:01:53.110> that's<00:01:53.260> this<00:01:53.440> that's<00:01:54.010> the<00:01:54.370> color<00:01:54.610> of

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
plastic that's this that's the color of

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.030 
plastic that's this that's the color of
the<00:01:54.790> vehicle<00:01:55.080> so<00:01:56.080> what<00:01:56.470> happens<00:01:56.830> is<00:01:56.920> they'll

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
the vehicle so what happens is they'll

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.460 
the vehicle so what happens is they'll
get<00:01:57.160> all<00:01:57.310> pitted<00:01:57.820> and<00:01:57.970> ugly<00:01:58.300> looking<00:01:58.600> but<00:01:59.350> um

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
get all pitted and ugly looking but um

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.800 
get all pitted and ugly looking but um
take<00:01:59.950> them<00:02:00.130> off<00:02:00.220> I<00:02:00.310> haven't<00:02:00.520> painted<00:02:00.700> to<00:02:01.690> match

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
take them off I haven't painted to match

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:02.880 
take them off I haven't painted to match
