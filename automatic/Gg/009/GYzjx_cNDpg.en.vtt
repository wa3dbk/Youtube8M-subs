obvious<00:04:18.850> here<00:04:19.060> I'm<00:04:19.180> first<00:04:19.570> you're<00:04:19.840> going<00:04:20.049> to

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
obvious here I'm first you're going to

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.659 
obvious here I'm first you're going to
see<00:04:20.350> that<00:04:20.470> does<00:04:20.709> not<00:04:20.859> have<00:04:21.100> a<00:04:21.130> zoom<00:04:21.430> feature

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
see that does not have a zoom feature

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.990 
see that does not have a zoom feature
this<00:04:22.060> is<00:04:22.240> a<00:04:22.270> something<00:04:23.169> only<00:04:23.979> the<00:04:24.280> high-end

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
this is a something only the high-end

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.790 
this is a something only the high-end
cameras<00:04:25.479> have<00:04:25.660> and<00:04:25.840> I'm<00:04:25.990> not<00:04:26.200> even<00:04:26.440> sure<00:04:26.650> if

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
cameras have and I'm not even sure if

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.630 
cameras have and I'm not even sure if
all<00:04:27.010> of<00:04:27.040> them<00:04:27.280> do<00:04:27.460> one<00:04:27.850> of<00:04:28.000> mine<00:04:28.240> as<00:04:28.570> for<00:04:28.840> sure

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
all of them do one of mine as for sure

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.740 
all of them do one of mine as for sure
let's<00:04:30.640> take<00:04:30.760> a<00:04:30.910> look<00:04:31.090> at<00:04:31.180> what<00:04:31.330> else<00:04:31.510> we've<00:04:31.720> got

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
let's take a look at what else we've got

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.260 
let's take a look at what else we've got
here<00:04:32.220> you<00:04:33.220> can<00:04:33.370> do<00:04:33.490> the<00:04:33.580> flip<00:04:33.820> and<00:04:34.030> mirror

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
here you can do the flip and mirror

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.520 
here you can do the flip and mirror
image<00:04:34.570> that's<00:04:34.780> a<00:04:34.900> pretty<00:04:35.140> cool<00:04:35.320> feature

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
image that's a pretty cool feature

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.150 
image that's a pretty cool feature
pretty<00:04:36.520> useful<00:04:36.940> but<00:04:37.150> ultimately<00:04:37.660> you<00:04:37.900> know

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
pretty useful but ultimately you know

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.350 
pretty useful but ultimately you know
something<00:04:39.160> you<00:04:39.250> can<00:04:39.430> live<00:04:39.580> without<00:04:39.880> let's<00:04:40.240> go

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
something you can live without let's go

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.540 
something you can live without let's go
to<00:04:40.419> the<00:04:40.600> settings<00:04:40.840> and<00:04:41.110> take<00:04:41.289> a<00:04:41.350> look<00:04:41.560> there<00:04:41.830> so

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
to the settings and take a look there so

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.580 
to the settings and take a look there so
what<00:04:42.880> we<00:04:43.000> have<00:04:43.150> here<00:04:43.419> is<00:04:43.600> the<00:04:43.810> standard<00:04:44.229> fear

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
what we have here is the standard fear

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:45.840 
what we have here is the standard fear
and<00:04:44.770> then<00:04:44.919> we're<00:04:45.039> going<00:04:45.160> to<00:04:45.190> move<00:04:45.370> to<00:04:45.400> video

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
and then we're going to move to video

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.580 
and then we're going to move to video
where<00:04:46.090> the<00:04:46.240> interesting<00:04:46.720> stuff<00:04:46.960> is<00:04:47.140> here<00:04:47.320> you

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
where the interesting stuff is here you

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.430 
where the interesting stuff is here you
will<00:04:47.770> notice<00:04:47.950> a<00:04:48.190> function<00:04:48.669> is<00:04:48.760> missing<00:04:49.180> here

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
will notice a function is missing here

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.170 
will notice a function is missing here
namely<00:04:50.440> the<00:04:50.919> function<00:04:51.070> that<00:04:51.430> disables<00:04:51.910> part

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
namely the function that disables part

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.959 
namely the function that disables part
of<00:04:52.300> the<00:04:52.419> view<00:04:52.630> of<00:04:52.660> the

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:52.969 
of the view of the

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:55.600 
of the view of the
amaura<00:04:53.319> this<00:04:54.319> is<00:04:54.469> also<00:04:54.649> something<00:04:55.039> that's

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
amaura this is also something that's

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.089 
amaura this is also something that's
specifically<00:04:56.539> to<00:04:56.689> the<00:04:56.809> high-end<00:04:57.259> cameras<00:04:57.829> you

00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:58.099 
specifically to the high-end cameras you

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:00.069 
specifically to the high-end cameras you
don't<00:04:58.369> have<00:04:58.610> it<00:04:58.729> here<00:04:58.999> so<00:04:59.179> if<00:04:59.269> I<00:04:59.360> want<00:04:59.629> to<00:04:59.719> blur

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:00.079 
don't have it here so if I want to blur

00:05:00.079 --> 00:05:01.839 
don't have it here so if I want to blur
out<00:05:00.289> something<00:05:00.799> up<00:05:00.949> there<00:05:01.159> about<00:05:01.459> completely

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:01.849 
out something up there about completely

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:04.149 
out something up there about completely
cover<00:05:02.119> something<00:05:03.110> with<00:05:03.259> the<00:05:03.349> privacy<00:05:03.829> filter

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:04.159 
cover something with the privacy filter

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:07.179 
cover something with the privacy filter
would<00:05:04.369> not<00:05:04.579> be<00:05:04.729> possible<00:05:05.079> also<00:05:06.079> you<00:05:06.139> see<00:05:06.349> 720p

00:05:07.179 --> 00:05:07.189 
would not be possible also you see 720p

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:08.799 
would not be possible also you see 720p
is<00:05:07.339> the<00:05:07.459> maximum<00:05:07.909> this<00:05:08.029> camera<00:05:08.360> can<00:05:08.539> reach

00:05:08.799 --> 00:05:08.809 
is the maximum this camera can reach

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:11.249 
is the maximum this camera can reach
which<00:05:09.079> is<00:05:09.259> actually<00:05:09.679> quite<00:05:09.829> sufficient<00:05:10.519> I

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:11.259 
which is actually quite sufficient I

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:14.139 
which is actually quite sufficient I
personally<00:05:12.259> prefer<00:05:12.619> the<00:05:12.739> 960<00:05:13.369> Pido<00:05:13.579> it<00:05:13.909> just

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:14.149 
personally prefer the 960 Pido it just

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:17.529 
personally prefer the 960 Pido it just
looks<00:05:14.389> much<00:05:14.689> more<00:05:15.110> clear<00:05:15.649> and<00:05:16.360> just<00:05:17.360> more

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:17.539 
looks much more clear and just more

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:19.119 
looks much more clear and just more
appealing<00:05:17.929> but<00:05:18.229> that's<00:05:18.409> why<00:05:18.619> these<00:05:18.679> other

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:19.129 
appealing but that's why these other

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:21.189 
appealing but that's why these other
cameras<00:05:19.549> are<00:05:19.699> more<00:05:19.909> expensive<00:05:20.209> as<00:05:20.479> well<00:05:20.689> other

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.199 
cameras are more expensive as well other

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:22.959 
cameras are more expensive as well other
than<00:05:21.379> that<00:05:21.529> you<00:05:21.739> have<00:05:21.889> the<00:05:22.039> snapshot<00:05:22.519> settings

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:22.969 
than that you have the snapshot settings

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:25.659 
than that you have the snapshot settings
the<00:05:23.779> standard<00:05:24.439> saying<00:05:24.679> that<00:05:24.889> the<00:05:25.459> night

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
the standard saying that the night

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:27.339 
the standard saying that the night
vision<00:05:26.029> of<00:05:26.119> course<00:05:26.449> which<00:05:27.049> I<00:05:27.229> already

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:27.349 
vision of course which I already

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:29.529 
vision of course which I already
demonstrated<00:05:28.129> to<00:05:28.279> you<00:05:28.399> these<00:05:28.999> features<00:05:29.360> are

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:29.539 
demonstrated to you these features are

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:31.600 
demonstrated to you these features are
important<00:05:29.989> of<00:05:30.110> course<00:05:30.139> the<00:05:30.709> motion<00:05:31.279> detection

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
important of course the motion detection

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.279 
important of course the motion detection
which<00:05:31.879> is<00:05:32.029> probably<00:05:32.389> the<00:05:32.479> most<00:05:32.719> important

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:33.289 
which is probably the most important

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:35.609 
which is probably the most important
feature<00:05:33.439> these<00:05:33.919> cameras<00:05:34.639> actually<00:05:34.819> have<00:05:35.239> and

00:05:35.609 --> 00:05:35.619 
feature these cameras actually have and

00:05:35.619 --> 00:05:38.019 
feature these cameras actually have and
from<00:05:36.619> what<00:05:36.769> I<00:05:36.799> know<00:05:36.919> all<00:05:37.249> of<00:05:37.279> them<00:05:37.519> do<00:05:37.729> so

00:05:38.019 --> 00:05:38.029 
from what I know all of them do so

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:40.059 
from what I know all of them do so
that's<00:05:38.719> something<00:05:39.019> that<00:05:39.229> you<00:05:39.379> want<00:05:39.769> to<00:05:39.860> know

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:40.069 
that's something that you want to know

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:42.369 
that's something that you want to know
if<00:05:40.339> you<00:05:40.519> can<00:05:40.759> if<00:05:41.360> you<00:05:41.509> can<00:05:41.569> if<00:05:42.049> you<00:05:42.169> say<00:05:42.349> for

00:05:42.369 --> 00:05:42.379 
if you can if you can if you say for

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:44.169 
if you can if you can if you say for
example<00:05:42.919> it's<00:05:43.039> not<00:05:43.069> so<00:05:43.339> important<00:05:43.849> for<00:05:44.029> me

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:44.179 
example it's not so important for me

00:05:44.179 --> 00:05:47.889 
example it's not so important for me
that<00:05:44.209> the<00:05:44.449> camera<00:05:44.989> can<00:05:45.259> come<00:05:46.449> block<00:05:47.449> out<00:05:47.689> an

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:47.899 
that the camera can come block out an

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:49.809 
that the camera can come block out an
area<00:05:48.110> for<00:05:48.469> example<00:05:48.559> this<00:05:49.189> camera<00:05:49.489> will<00:05:49.699> do

00:05:49.809 --> 00:05:49.819 
area for example this camera will do

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:51.429 
area for example this camera will do
just<00:05:50.089> as<00:05:50.239> well<00:05:50.269> for<00:05:50.629> you<00:05:50.779> if<00:05:50.929> you're<00:05:51.139> satisfied

00:05:51.429 --> 00:05:51.439 
just as well for you if you're satisfied

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:55.059 
just as well for you if you're satisfied
with<00:05:51.739> 720p<00:05:52.459> I<00:05:53.169> find<00:05:54.169> this<00:05:54.259> camera<00:05:54.469> to<00:05:54.709> be<00:05:54.799> quite

00:05:55.059 --> 00:05:55.069 
with 720p I find this camera to be quite

00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:57.429 
with 720p I find this camera to be quite
good<00:05:55.339> for<00:05:55.549> a<00:05:55.610> small<00:05:55.969> room<00:05:56.179> here<00:05:56.929> we<00:05:57.019> can<00:05:57.199> set<00:05:57.409> up

00:05:57.429 --> 00:05:57.439 
good for a small room here we can set up

00:05:57.439 --> 00:06:00.339 
good for a small room here we can set up
what<00:05:58.429> times<00:05:58.759> and<00:05:59.089> which<00:05:59.479> days<00:05:59.749> the<00:06:00.019> motion

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:00.349 
what times and which days the motion
