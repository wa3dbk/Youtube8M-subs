00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.570
 I think you can actually feel 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.099
 you can describe it badly but it 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.110
 is just overwhelming what 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.370
 we have delivered the third today 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.520
 Bundesliga teams from the competition too 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.779
 had to shoot fans and and the whole 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.770
 team and everything around it 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.539
 compliment we have great 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.980
 not to be fought super cohesion 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.380
 smooth consultants quite a few opportunities 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.460
 out of the game that we then in 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.500
 eleven meters shoot the little bit of luck 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.910
 Having our side is just easy 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.619
 outstanding so i can still do it 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.680
 do not really believe me 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.690
 I have reached it, but I think so 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.820
 very tactical today very disciplined 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.530
 played much of the ballermann ex see 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.670
 but that was not important to everyone 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.719
 clear for the other Rheingauer 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.129
 but still works which better 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.329
 team but ultimately have us 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.210
 interspersed meter shoot 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.800
 and yes I know what else to say 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.719
 yes it is of course one 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.649
 incredible feeling now in the semifinals 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.960
 to stand 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.180
 the team has again today at 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.430
 caught catching day we have 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.870
 thought life was hard and yes 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.430
 We are all looking forward to seeing you today 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.540
 stand 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.159
 I think that has something for the sake of 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.170
 It is not easy to do when you are 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.250
 come here and we have good day like that 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.470
 today as it had also back must 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.240
 Everything fits together then it is easy 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.500
 just be open minded too 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.360
 a bit of luck but also hard work 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.790
 yes , that's just the nicest thing there is 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.070
 one against the first division too late ago 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.290
 full audience spectators have us 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.409
 120 minutes even if one misses 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.909
 was that is just outstanding yes and it 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.570
 just makes fun of playing here 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:36.060
 yes I believe for us as another side 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.869
 it's just easier mental against that 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.610
 a big opponent 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.290
 my gladbachers does well and tries 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.939
 to run the ball is a whole 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.970
 Just in our place we have with 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.830
 the means available to us 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.930
 against it and that has again 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.030
 little chance against 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.920
 really good team I think so 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.210
 because I'm the deciding one 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.850
 eleven meters last meters 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.490
 have included and I think that 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.020
 you can still be his children 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.430
 tell and that's just easy 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.900
 Great is a nice evening for everyone 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.890
 interview players but i believe 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.810
 all at the stadium 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.410
 apart from gladbach fans mean 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.410
 huge fun
