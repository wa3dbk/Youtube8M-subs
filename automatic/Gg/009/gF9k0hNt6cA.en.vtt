00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.170
 she is 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.300
 he 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:18.830
 than literally 10 years ago the concept itself 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:23.640
 presence of echo sounder usb she somehow 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.689
 sounded like something new not many 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.940
 there were echo sounders 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:32.910
 many use the club measures later 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:35.160
 came the era of the use of navigation 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.129
 fisher sounders have become much larger 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.449
 understand where they catch that terrain that 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.140
 exactly present on the bottom 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:46.879
 but at this period the development of fishing 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:50.909
 electronics conventional echo sounder 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:56.519
 This already we say so not novelty this not in 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:01:00.330
 wonder of many he is now probably 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:05.339
 I will say this is the era of a new generation 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:07.760
 devices these devices lawrence have 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.110
 Lawrence is called scan structures 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.740
 humminbird's website is called a website 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.229
 imaging principle the technology is the same 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.439
 I will not go into details on what 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:23.050
 it is based but precisely with the help of these 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:26.740
 devices can be in reality to evaluate 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:30.280
 what picture is hidden under us 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:35.650
 water layer that is, in the usual echo sounder we 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:39.820
 can see fish in different horizon he 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:42.790
 we would sort it out into a flat 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.710
 the image that is in one line inscribed 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.780
 under each fish and and depth we can 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.210
 guess what it was standing above here 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.540
 it stood below it nestled 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.180
 to the bottom also in the usual echo sounder 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.490
 well determine the stiffness on can 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.650
 even guess whether you saw there 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.430
 snag or was it still grass 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:05.380
 powerful enough such a bunch of grass 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.150
 for example, in the same scan structure device 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.790
 You do not need to speculate about anything you need 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.940
 slightly conjure settings under 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:15.130
 certain depth and in mode 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.690
 real time you will see then 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.090
 what's going on under your boat 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.100
 that is, if you float above the flooded 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.400
 the forest it will be shown as flooded 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.670
 forest 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.640
 if it will lie bare logs without 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.980
 branches at the bottom it will be it will be 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.390
 a clear picture of exactly this one 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.940
 the object is on the bottom unconditionally 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:40.769
 for example the same predator in the snags 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:45.010
 very hard to determine by this 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:47.170
 modern device but if fish 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.069
 is a bit at least measured 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.310
 condition 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:54.690
 that is 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:57.180
 much easier to find and feed fish 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.099
 for the predator and the predator itself 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.390
 which usually revolves around this 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:04.920
 feed fish the most important difference 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.800
 this class of devices from the usual 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.160
 echo sounder this as I said reality 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.780
 the reality of that picture which 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.790
 located directly under the boat we 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.870
 see in real time then over 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.030
 than we swim 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.300
 we don't need to guess what we are 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:24.810
 clearly understand what exactly is there and 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:29.400
 what's important for example sailing over 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:31.709
 any part of this device so that 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.410
 do not be unfounded we have a depth of 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:38.519
 area 6 7 8 9 meters at this depth 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.959
 coverage area structures useful scan area 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.690
 coverage in which everything is good enough 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.330
 you can see these are two beams to the right and left of 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.670
 boats somewhere around 35 maximum 40 meters 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.980
 that is, in one pass on the curb or 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:53.580
 some interesting section we immediately 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:56.459
 see the relief of the fish well small fish there 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:00.269
 hard to identify though 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:05.790
 but large can be seen very well that is, we 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:08.609
 Here in this zone 70-80 meter immediately with 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.500
 first pass we all understand that there that 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:12.450
 we are interested may be the opposite of what 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.229
 we are completely this area is not 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:19.289
 interested and importantly even 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:21.299
 noticing an object somewhere on the edge of not 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:24.479
 directly submarine i will allow 20 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:27.060
 meters right or left we can on this 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:28.320
 the device press the pause to move the cursor and 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.490
 score directly 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.830
 gps coordinates of the object that we 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.479
 I liked what it gives us on 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.270
 sailing over some particular 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:41.760
 plots sent for example go see 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.860
 right or left of us snag sailing 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.380
 along the same trajectory we hammer this 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.169
 snag is already in dps 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.060
 turn around and 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:52.099
 Our device already has accurate 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.529
 the coordinates of this snag is left 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:56.990
 just go to the next tack down 

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:57.889
 anchor or electric motor and directly 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.800
 update this snag 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:03.169
 we don't need to get directly over 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.539
 snag we can pass in the country this 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:09.080
 very important greatly facilitates the search 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:13.479
 on an unfamiliar new pond and I would 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.479
 said so completely 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:20.630
 completely breaks the notion of how 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:23.140
 she's like it really is and what's going on 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.140
 under water
