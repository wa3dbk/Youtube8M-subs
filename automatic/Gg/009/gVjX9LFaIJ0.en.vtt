00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:09.520
 It's a new video from and well as you see 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:11.500
 now I'm just good, I do not know 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.170
 how many hours have passed since you 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:20.410
 I went up the last script mode called pause 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:22.270
 or play pause or good a play pause 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.950
 and all that and I hope you liked it 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.960
 rather, he mentioned that if they liked the 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.880
 analysis that leads and I hope you receive 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.250
 much more likes since that helps that 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.230
 he says ' I know they liked the 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.180
 videos and who likes the diagonal channel 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.679
 we are bringing a super mode that without 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.570
 fear of being wrong I think it's one of 

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:39.940
 the best modes that you are going to see 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.069
 rather it is created by wright script 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.260
 low pro of all credits towards him 

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:46.539
 I'll leave the download link 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.640
 down in the description of the video and this 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:50.979
 mode consists of a yes but strange and 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.039
 it has a texture and apart from that 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:55.539
 texture has two js point files that 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:56.859
 would be the two modes the two without 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:59.589
 install to serve them is 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:01.089
 divided into two parts although it is in 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:03.069
 beta phase but I at least do not 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.979
 they must easy beta but already as something 

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:08.020
 pretty close and good is a bit on 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.890
 fez in beta phase because I think it has 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.100
 Some 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.080
 bush but they are minimal the truth that I think 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.600
 that they will fix it because they are going to take 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.770
 the updates in the first row 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.360
 as we're going to start it's going to be but 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.880
 that when we get in there says podcast more 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.700
 of investment point zero and well let's 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.820
 put good only on the image well 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.110
 that we get him 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.790
 the image of what 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:40.000
 of the chat leaves some letters and some 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.880
 commands that it acquires us or gives us the 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.890
 money maker called pro so that 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.360
 we put more help and there we 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.330
 all the commands that we are going to come out 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.330
 to use for this mode well now that 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:55.330
 let's put play kpmg which is for 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.370
 know what it is and how we are going to 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.310
 use and as you can see there are not four 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:04.900
 pm plates is payment animates animals break 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:08.320
 up in tm spawn monsters play kpmg items 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:11.110
 from kpmg blogs well these are the four 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:15.540
 commands and I'll teach them how to use 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:17.680
 each one of them I'm not going to tell you 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.920
 I 'm not going to teach you how to write 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.560
 because it helps them and well there 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.480
 attract help for you to leave 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.879
 to put pre k pm 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.360
 is for animals and as you can see, do not use 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:34.390
 new animals does not leave the giraffe yet 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:39.010
 I think it's a panda and a cow is being 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.390
 something weird there are some you can say good 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.810
 when I already told you there's a guy 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.150
 horse there is a new duck and comes a 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.720
 hen than in the regular minecraft 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:53.410
 I think and they come as good guys 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.930
 I think it brings like 7 or 8 modes of 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.120
 new animals is pretty good and 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.459
 good this world we are called moqur 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.489
 aturas because it also includes new 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.470
 monsters and include new weapons and two 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.190
 new blocks arrive now that you've already seen 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.190
 animals 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.360
 let's go to the next image to 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.610
 that you see what are the 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.850
 new monsters that I have been telling you 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.280
 how do you see there I put that guy a 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.020
 scenario so that they do not burn here not 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.390
 you see everyone because there is me 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.390
 they came out like three I think actually 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.490
 they are like 15 modes that pay you is 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.290
 pretty good the way since as you see 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.800
 there is a type dracula has gone up in a 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.200
 cow there is a yeti I believe there is a man 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:42.489
 wolf there is like a green horse but not 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:45.370
 I know what you mean there is a good 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:48.489
 archer raised in one in one of those 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.530
 horses I say there is a mining zombie and 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.440
 good as they are in this dracula and everything 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.390
 that's pretty good this I do not think that 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.930
 the image looks pretty good from what 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:02.830
 that I'm explaining and well she's going 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.640
 to the line of the items that this 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.940
 new mode and 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:10.370
 it adds food and how they see there too 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.590
 more add blood and eggs and those swords 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.569
 as you well know and all that 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.100
 each one has a utility in me I do not 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.870
 taught the character because you are going 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.950
 to describe by their own means and 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:24.440
 they will and will give them anxiety 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.600
 try to install this mode and start it 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.640
 discover by means of craft eos and there 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.580
 you just did not take me out 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.380
 getting these new new and 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.450
 we have what they will be able to achieve with 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.449
 new blocks be it weapons and everything from 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:40.289
 that 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:42.599
 also clarified the round I want them 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:44.999
 clarify that the modes have enough 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:48.419
 life so if I try to kill with 

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:51.419
 a diamond sword and with one of 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:54.180
 iron and I have to give it about 15 or 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:55.559
 20 touches for you to kill them so that 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:00.360
 does not mean that it bothers me enough 

00:04:55.559 --> 00:05:03.629
 good since it includes more more damage to 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.879
 the time of the modes more like super good 

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:07.710
 and now finally the blocks as you see 

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:09.360
 only pave us a block not rest 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.159
 I know why they have put zebra that of 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.439
 rest and the last block that are 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:14.789
 watching is the bloody block good 

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:17.099
 until he left the mod 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:19.919
 I hope you really liked it 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:22.770
 are four modes in one comes the one from 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:26.490
 new to animals as craters 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:31.289
 new ones are bugs or new monsters 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:34.319
 has new soccer modes more food and 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:36.809
 it also comes blogs blogs or 

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:38.550
 blocks of sea blogs well I hope that you 

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:40.200
 have liked the video and if so let me 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.810
 like for what 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.120
 if you liked the video and we can 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:47.820
 follow later with the channel since 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.980
 It costs a lot to be part of a channel that 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.350
 receives many visits or at least I 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.880
 so I see the comparison as we were 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.320
 before but good I hope that I have 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.790
 liked the video do not forget to subscribe 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.420
 dale light and see you in the next 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.420
 goodbye
