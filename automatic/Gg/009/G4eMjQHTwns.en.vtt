00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
know I think in Japan or in other

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.290 
know I think in Japan or in other
countries<00:00:46.410> they're<00:00:46.649> if<00:00:47.460> it's<00:00:47.640> an<00:00:47.760> actual<00:00:47.940> box

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
countries they're if it's an actual box

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.110 
countries they're if it's an actual box
it's<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:49.079> set<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.590> comes<00:00:49.890> with<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.760> certain

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
it's a set that comes with a certain

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.790 
it's a set that comes with a certain
like<00:00:51.510> certain<00:00:51.899> Pokemon<00:00:52.320> right<00:00:52.379> here<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.649> get

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
like certain Pokemon right here you get

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.529 
like certain Pokemon right here you get
them<00:00:52.890> randomly<00:00:53.250> so<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.670> could<00:00:54.030> get<00:00:54.239> three<00:00:54.480> of

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
them randomly so I could get three of

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.299 
them randomly so I could get three of
the<00:00:54.629> same<00:00:54.840> Pokemon<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:55.500> that's<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.800> sad<00:00:56.039> face

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
the same Pokemon so that's a sad face

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.209 
the same Pokemon so that's a sad face
right<00:00:56.520> there<00:00:56.760> so<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.949> thought<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.010> was<00:00:59.100> pretty

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
right there so I thought it was pretty

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.680 
right there so I thought it was pretty
cool<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.520> came<00:00:59.670> with<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.820> little<00:00:59.910> package<00:01:00.390> a

cool it came with a little package a

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.020 
cool it came with a little package a
little<00:01:01.170> pokeball<00:01:01.620> contains<00:01:02.129> one<00:01:02.460> Pokemon

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030
