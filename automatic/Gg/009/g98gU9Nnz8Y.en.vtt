00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.170

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.600
 try to leave or take command 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.250

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.740
 when to stay gameplay so equal 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.560
 boring and I want to enjoy the hook 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.940

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.410

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.159
 of gameplay 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.200
 but it's because I want to give my opinion 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.820
 It's me, I think I played here some 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.020
