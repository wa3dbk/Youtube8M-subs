00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.690 

next<00:00:25.570> take<00:00:25.780> a<00:00:25.810> brush<00:00:26.530> or<00:00:26.890> a<00:00:26.950> toothbrush<00:00:27.460> or

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:30.100 
maybe the ball of foil and make some

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.960 
maybe the ball of foil and make some
texture<00:00:31.890> so<00:00:32.890> it'll<00:00:33.220> end<00:00:33.610> up<00:00:33.760> looking

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:33.970 
texture so it'll end up looking

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.770 
texture so it'll end up looking
something<00:00:34.630> like<00:00:34.930> this

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
something like this

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.380 
something like this
to<00:00:37.780> give<00:00:38.020> the<00:00:38.350> edges<00:00:38.830> a<00:00:39.190> look<00:00:39.910> like<00:00:40.150> they've

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
to give the edges a look like they've

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.900

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
use a paintbrush to just add it around

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.110 
use a paintbrush to just add it around
the<00:00:50.590> edge<00:00:50.739> and<00:00:51.160> you<00:00:51.340> can<00:00:51.520> put<00:00:51.700> some<00:00:51.850> in<00:00:52.000> the

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
the edge and you can put some in the

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:59.130 
the edge and you can put some in the
center<00:00:52.450> if<00:00:52.570> you<00:00:52.720> like<00:00:52.900> too

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.230 

okay<00:01:00.140> let's<00:01:00.530> start<00:01:00.830> folding<00:01:01.040> it<00:01:01.310> now<00:01:01.460> flip<00:01:02.120> it

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:02.240 
okay let's start folding it now flip it

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.370 
okay let's start folding it now flip it
upside<00:01:02.630> down<00:01:02.660> and<00:01:03.940> bring<00:01:04.940> two<00:01:05.510> edges<00:01:06.020> together

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
upside down and bring two edges together

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.410 
upside down and bring two edges together
but<00:01:06.770> don't<00:01:07.010> pinch<00:01:07.310> it<00:01:07.460> closed<00:01:07.730> you<00:01:09.910> use<00:01:10.910> a<00:01:10.940> tool

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
but don't pinch it closed you use a tool

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.290 
but don't pinch it closed you use a tool
that's<00:01:12.410> kind<00:01:13.190> of<00:01:13.310> round<00:01:13.550> you<00:01:13.820> could<00:01:14.000> use<00:01:14.150> your

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
that's kind of round you could use your

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:21.210 
that's kind of round you could use your
finger<00:01:14.660> to<00:01:14.690> just<00:01:15.700> sort<00:01:16.700> of<00:01:16.820> bend<00:01:17.030> it<00:01:17.150> like<00:01:17.210> so

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.770 

then<00:01:22.220> you<00:01:22.430> have<00:01:22.640> your<00:01:23.030> basic<00:01:23.330> shape<00:01:25.210> but<00:01:26.210> don't

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
then you have your basic shape but don't

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:33.490 
then you have your basic shape but don't
pinch<00:01:27.020> it<00:01:27.170> closed<00:01:27.410> yes<00:01:28.030> still<00:01:29.030> I<00:01:32.380> printed<00:01:33.380> out

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
pinch it closed yes still I printed out

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.890 
pinch it closed yes still I printed out
a<00:01:33.560> fortune<00:01:33.979> on<00:01:34.340> my<00:01:34.369> computer<00:01:35.030> and<00:01:35.300> I<00:01:35.479> measured

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
a fortune on my computer and I measured

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.630 
a fortune on my computer and I measured
it<00:01:36.020> to<00:01:36.229> make<00:01:36.380> sure<00:01:36.590> it<00:01:36.710> wasn't<00:01:36.890> too<00:01:37.130> big<00:01:37.340> or<00:01:37.610> too

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
it to make sure it wasn't too big or too

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.250 
it to make sure it wasn't too big or too
small

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.260 
small

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.570 
small
well<00:01:39.260> it<00:01:39.560> is<00:01:39.740> still<00:01:39.920> kind<00:01:40.220> of<00:01:40.369> big<00:01:40.520> but<00:01:40.550> anyway

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
well it is still kind of big but anyway

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.020 
well it is still kind of big but anyway
then<00:01:43.580> roll<00:01:44.270> out<00:01:44.420> some<00:01:44.660> white<00:01:44.869> clay<00:01:45.050> and

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
then roll out some white clay and

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.550 
then roll out some white clay and
measure<00:01:47.030> it<00:01:47.270> to<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.540> right<00:01:47.690> size<00:01:48.020> that<00:01:48.350> you

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
measure it to the right size that you

00:01:48.560 --> 00:02:02.620 
measure it to the right size that you
need

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.470 

next<00:02:03.630> place<00:02:04.080> the<00:02:04.110> fortune<00:02:05.030> kind<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.180> tucked

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 
next place the fortune kind of tucked

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.240 
next place the fortune kind of tucked
inside<00:02:06.960> so<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.320> looks<00:02:07.500> like<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.860> came<00:02:08.040> from

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
inside so it looks like it came from

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.690 
inside so it looks like it came from
inside<00:02:08.430> and<00:02:09.500> put<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.130> place<00:02:11.310> where<00:02:11.580> you

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
inside and put it to the place where you

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.050 
inside and put it to the place where you
want<00:02:11.820> it<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.090> be<00:02:13.250> then<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.460> can<00:02:14.670> start

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
want it to be then you can start

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:23.400 
want it to be then you can start
pinching<00:02:15.540> it<00:02:15.660> closed<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.730> cookie<00:02:17.730> part

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.640 

and<00:02:24.410> if<00:02:25.160> you<00:02:25.490> want<00:02:25.730> it<00:02:25.820> to<00:02:26.000> be<00:02:26.150> a<00:02:26.180> charm<00:02:26.650> go

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
and if you want it to be a charm go

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.600 
and if you want it to be a charm go
ahead<00:02:27.830> and<00:02:28.010> put<00:02:28.190> a<00:02:28.220> pin<00:02:28.520> in<00:02:28.550> and<00:02:30.400> after<00:02:31.400> that

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
ahead and put a pin in and after that

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.290 
ahead and put a pin in and after that
bake<00:02:32.120> it<00:02:32.360> according<00:02:33.140> to<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:33.980> directions<00:02:34.300> in

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
bake it according to the directions in

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.820 
bake it according to the directions in
your<00:02:35.660> oven<00:02:37.300> okay<00:02:38.300> after<00:02:38.480> it's<00:02:38.930> been<00:02:39.170> baked

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
your oven okay after it's been baked

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.630 
your oven okay after it's been baked
I<00:02:39.860> recommend<00:02:40.700> pulling<00:02:41.270> the<00:02:41.450> pin<00:02:41.690> out<00:02:41.960> and

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
I recommend pulling the pin out and

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.190 
I recommend pulling the pin out and
using<00:02:43.640> some<00:02:43.970> superglue<00:02:45.700> just<00:02:46.700> to<00:02:46.990> make<00:02:47.990> sure

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
using some superglue just to make sure

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.860 
using some superglue just to make sure
the<00:02:48.410> pin<00:02:48.650> won't<00:02:48.860> ever<00:02:49.160> come<00:02:49.310> out<00:02:51.670> because<00:02:52.870> the

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
the pin won't ever come out because the

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.960 
the pin won't ever come out because the
terms<00:02:54.140> I<00:02:54.380> make<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:54.890> pins<00:02:55.160> tend<00:02:55.520> to<00:02:55.610> fall<00:02:55.790> out

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
terms I make the pins tend to fall out

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:03.550 
terms I make the pins tend to fall out
so<00:02:56.000> I<00:02:56.240> glue<00:02:56.510> them<00:02:56.660> all<00:02:56.840> in<00:03:00.850> next<00:03:01.850> I<00:03:02.239> take<00:03:03.230> some

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
so I glue them all in next I take some

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.310 
so I glue them all in next I take some

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.289 

okay<00:03:36.640> and<00:03:36.909> before<00:03:37.569> the<00:03:37.930> gloss<00:03:38.319> dries<00:03:38.680> add<00:03:39.299> your
