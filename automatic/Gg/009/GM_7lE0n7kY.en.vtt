00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.920
 to 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.540
 how are many cases and Rachel this is 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.720
 the nail art design that we're going to 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.250
 be doing now let's start I started 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.560
 for applying this enamel in a shade 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.320
 short in green color of sally hansen and 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.150
 this is called green 9 followed by this 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.669
 I'll be sponjan dome one more tone 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.669
 dark green this is a and zinc 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:35.550
 and it's called manicure and I'm going directly to 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.079
 apply the polish to my sponge and with 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.020
 pure pats I'm going to apply 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.280
 about two thirds of my nail 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.660
 now about every girl I will be 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.609
 applying this glaze with glitters 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.760
 blur bears called smoking 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:46.760
 high 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.460
 this is the measure of brush that I'm going to 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.090
 be using to paint my 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.090
 sunflowers 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.550
 I'm going to start by painting a circle in 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:02.579
 an orange color and I will be 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.140
 painting a flower and a half is optional 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.840
 where you are going to want to add your 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.460
 little flowers using the same brush 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.850
 I will be painting the petals of my 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.100
 flower 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.020
 going all around the circle 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.119
 orange that I just painted and the 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.390
 shape of the petals is in the form of 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.390
 almond 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.360
 about the average sunflower I'm going to be 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.730
 doing in the corner of vineyard I'm going to 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.280
 do exactly the same thing my 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.409
 yellow petals 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.930
 followed by this I will be using 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.880
 these glitters in gold color of the brand 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.710
 focal and it's called wood 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.020
 I will be applying this painting in the 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.600
 center of my flowers and this painting is 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.130
 applies opaque but once the 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.049
 paint you see the glitters in gold 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.149
 while the center of my flower dries 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.039
 I'm going to start painting my lady I'm going to 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.079
 start by painting the two wings I'm 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:55.619
 using paint that vindicates in color 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:55.619
 Red 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.650
 in the center I will be painting with 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.330
 a painting in black 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.020
 and now it's time to paint your 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.020
 little head 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.470
 and his two antennas 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.690
 on your wings I will be adding 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.690
 little black dots 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.970
 to finish we will have the line 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.830
 Black to her little head 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.750
 towards the side of my flowers I will be 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.970
 using an acrylic paint in color 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.490
 green in a short tone and I'll be 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.120
 adding a little flower for each of 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.120
 my flowers 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.939
 this is the measure of brush that I'm going to 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.620
 be using to delineate the 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:42.730
 petals of my flower and also my leaves 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.650
 green 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.719
 using the same orange color that 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.999
 I used for the center of my flower I'm going to 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:52.590
 be delineating each petal of my flower 

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:52.590
 on one side nothing more 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.570
 and I will be doing exactly the 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.780
 same thing about my sunflower half 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.780
 as well 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.030
 in the center of each of the petals 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.800
 of flower I will be painting a line 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.800
 finite in the same color too 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.940
 I will be delineating my green leaves 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.940
 in a darker tone 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.700
 in the center of my little green eyes I'm going to 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.859
 be doing a finite line and 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.019
 coming out of these two lines more I'm going to 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:35.370
 do the same with the green leaf of my 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.620
 top flower too 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.480
 and that's all apply your gloss coat 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.280
 to finish I hope you have 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.049
 enjoyed this video and to be made 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.330
 this design using its colors 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.200
 favorites take care and see you 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:52.830
 for the next goodbye 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.830
