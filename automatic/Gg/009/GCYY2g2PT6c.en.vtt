between DSLR videography and camcorder

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.380

is<00:00:58.559> actually<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.129> sound<00:00:59.370> well<00:00:59.910> not<00:01:00.090> only<00:01:00.210> the

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
is actually the sound well not only the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.819 
is actually the sound well not only the
sound<00:01:00.570> but<00:01:00.719> this<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.320> biggest<00:01:01.559> difference

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
sound but this is the biggest difference

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.820 
sound but this is the biggest difference
that<00:01:02.340> i<00:01:02.370> can<00:01:02.850> see<00:01:03.080> so<00:01:04.080> if<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.379> sort<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.680> the

that i can see so if you sort of the

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.350 
that i can see so if you sort of the
problem<00:01:05.129> with<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.339> sound<00:01:05.580> you'll<00:01:05.880> be<00:01:06.060> able<00:01:06.150> to

quality video the problem with DSLR

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.390 
quality video the problem with DSLR
cameras<00:01:10.320> they<00:01:10.470> are<00:01:10.530> not<00:01:10.710> designed<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.340> take

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
cameras they are not designed to take

several sound channels the best cameras
will<00:01:14.430> have<00:01:14.810> probably<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:16.170> stereo<00:01:16.830> input<00:01:17.549> it's<00:01:17.759> a

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
will have probably a stereo input it's a

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.300 
will have probably a stereo input it's a
3.5<00:01:18.509> jack<00:01:18.750> which<00:01:19.110> will<00:01:19.350> accept<00:01:19.799> up<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.009> two

3.5 jack which will accept up to two

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.370 
3.5 jack which will accept up to two

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
channels but how do you take two

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.320 
channels but how do you take two
channels<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.009> get<00:01:23.400> them<00:01:23.549> into<00:01:23.820> your<00:01:23.970> camera

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330

microphones<00:02:06.599> are<00:02:06.719> quite<00:02:06.959> good<00:02:07.200> directing<00:02:07.950> the

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
microphones are quite good directing the

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.420 
microphones are quite good directing the
the<00:02:08.940> beam<00:02:09.179> or<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:10.319> angle<00:02:10.799> or<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.009> cone

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
the beam or the angle or the cone

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.339 
the beam or the angle or the cone
however<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.120> want<00:02:12.269> to<00:02:12.330> call<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:12.569> and<00:02:12.900> it<00:02:13.200> will

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
however you want to call it and it will

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.470 
however you want to call it and it will
capture<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.830> right<00:02:14.099> sound<00:02:14.430> it's<00:02:15.239> still<00:02:15.420> a

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
capture the right sound it's still a

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.020 
capture the right sound it's still a
boom<00:02:15.720> mic<00:02:15.930> so<00:02:16.319> if<00:02:16.769> there's<00:02:17.579> a<00:02:17.670> lot<00:02:18.000> of

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
boom mic so if there's a lot of

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.789 
boom mic so if there's a lot of
background<00:02:18.450> noise<00:02:18.810> you<00:02:18.870> might<00:02:19.379> pick<00:02:19.590> that<00:02:19.769> up

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
background noise you might pick that up

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:21.949 
background noise you might pick that up
so<00:02:20.099> I<00:02:20.310> don't<00:02:20.910> trust<00:02:21.180> this<00:02:21.390> hum<00:02:21.599> present

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
so I don't trust this hum present

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.319 
so I don't trust this hum present
however<00:02:22.110> for<00:02:22.860> some<00:02:23.040> situations<00:02:23.640> these<00:02:24.000> are

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
however for some situations these are

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:26.690 
however for some situations these are
absolutely<00:02:25.049> good<00:02:25.260> now<00:02:25.709> if<00:02:25.920> you<00:02:26.069> go<00:02:26.190> very<00:02:26.220> cheap

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
absolutely good now if you go very cheap

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.150 
absolutely good now if you go very cheap
on<00:02:26.849> these<00:02:27.030> boom<00:02:27.480> mics<00:02:27.720> you<00:02:28.019> might<00:02:28.560> not<00:02:28.799> get<00:02:29.129> a

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
on these boom mics you might not get a

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.920 
on these boom mics you might not get a
good<00:02:29.459> quality<00:02:29.670> we've<00:02:30.510> got<00:02:30.810> here<00:02:31.410> a<00:02:31.709> rode

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
good quality we've got here a rode

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.009 
good quality we've got here a rode
microphone<00:02:33.930> I'm<00:02:34.769> not<00:02:35.010> sure<00:02:35.160> what's<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.549> model

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
microphone I'm not sure what's the model

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.720 
microphone I'm not sure what's the model
video<00:02:37.019> mic<00:02:37.379> it's<00:02:37.620> made<00:02:37.799> in<00:02:37.920> australia<00:02:38.310> and

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
video mic it's made in australia and

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.270 
video mic it's made in australia and
it's<00:02:39.000> one<00:02:39.150> of<00:02:39.239> the<00:02:39.359> good<00:02:39.480> ones<00:02:39.540> we<00:02:40.440> we've<00:02:41.099> been

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
it's one of the good ones we we've been

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.650 
it's one of the good ones we we've been
through<00:02:41.459> some<00:02:41.700> cheap<00:02:41.910> ones<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.299> we<00:02:42.359> actually

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
through some cheap ones and we actually

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.449 
through some cheap ones and we actually
throw<00:02:42.810> them<00:02:43.019> away<00:02:43.140> but<00:02:43.650> this<00:02:43.739> is<00:02:43.920> properly

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
throw them away but this is properly

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.240 
throw them away but this is properly
this<00:02:44.940> is<00:02:45.090> probably<00:02:45.569> a<00:02:45.989> good<00:02:46.349> acquisition<00:02:46.709> I'm

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
this is probably a good acquisition I'm

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.160 
this is probably a good acquisition I'm
gonna<00:02:47.430> put<00:02:47.609> it<00:02:47.700> on<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.849> camera<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.299> I<00:02:48.989> will

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
gonna put it on the camera and I will

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.870 
gonna put it on the camera and I will
show<00:02:49.349> you<00:02:49.410> exactly<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:50.040> sound<00:02:50.310> recorded<00:02:50.730> with

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
show you exactly the sound recorded with

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.860 
show you exactly the sound recorded with
this<00:02:51.769> ok<00:02:52.769> now<00:02:53.130> i'm<00:02:53.489> recording<00:02:54.030> sound<00:02:54.389> with<00:02:54.690> the

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
this ok now i'm recording sound with the

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.629 
this ok now i'm recording sound with the
boom<00:02:55.109> mic<00:02:55.349> which<00:02:55.560> is<00:02:55.709> on<00:02:55.859> top<00:02:56.040> of<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.310> camera

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:56.639 
boom mic which is on top of the camera

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:59.569 
boom mic which is on top of the camera
now<00:02:57.150> i<00:02:57.180> can<00:02:57.599> move<00:02:57.750> back<00:02:58.019> and<00:02:58.079> forth<00:02:58.560> so<00:02:59.280> at

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
now i can move back and forth so at

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.190 
now i can move back and forth so at
least<00:02:59.760> you<00:03:00.030> can<00:03:00.239> see<00:03:00.450> exactly<00:03:00.840> what<00:03:01.079> you're

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
least you can see exactly what you're

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.500 
least you can see exactly what you're
getting<00:03:01.290> yet<00:03:01.560> these<00:03:02.280> microphones<00:03:03.060> they<00:03:03.269> have

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
getting yet these microphones they have

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.270 
getting yet these microphones they have
some<00:03:03.780> sort<00:03:04.019> of<00:03:04.109> settings<00:03:04.530> there<00:03:04.739> will<00:03:04.859> be<00:03:05.010> some

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
some sort of settings there will be some

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.610 
some sort of settings there will be some
telephoto<00:03:05.910> they<00:03:06.569> can<00:03:06.750> record<00:03:07.019> sound<00:03:07.290> from<00:03:07.500> a

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
telephoto they can record sound from a

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.400 
telephoto they can record sound from a
more<00:03:07.829> bigger<00:03:08.609> distance<00:03:09.060> or<00:03:09.209> from<00:03:10.139> a<00:03:10.230> lower

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
more bigger distance or from a lower

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.470 
more bigger distance or from a lower
distance<00:03:10.889> the<00:03:11.370> problem<00:03:11.700> with<00:03:11.849> that<00:03:11.880> is<00:03:12.180> you

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
distance the problem with that is you

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.210 
distance the problem with that is you
will<00:03:12.900> pick<00:03:13.079> up<00:03:13.200> sound<00:03:13.470> that<00:03:13.650> you<00:03:13.739> don't<00:03:13.980> want

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
will pick up sound that you don't want

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.630 
will pick up sound that you don't want
for<00:03:14.639> example<00:03:14.669> if<00:03:15.120> someone<00:03:15.150> is<00:03:15.599> coming<00:03:15.810> and

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
for example if someone is coming and

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.240 
for example if someone is coming and
talking<00:03:17.060> all<00:03:17.540> the<00:03:18.470> worst<00:03:18.740> thing<00:03:18.920> that<00:03:19.100> can

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
talking all the worst thing that can

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.980 
talking all the worst thing that can
happen<00:03:19.310> is<00:03:19.670> actually<00:03:20.090> these<00:03:20.300> speakers<00:03:20.810> around

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:20.990 
happen is actually these speakers around

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.620 
happen is actually these speakers around
the<00:03:21.350> reception<00:03:22.040> area<00:03:22.340> in<00:03:22.730> this<00:03:22.940> case<00:03:23.180> because

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
the reception area in this case because

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.690 
the reception area in this case because
we<00:03:23.900> are<00:03:23.959> taking<00:03:24.140> weddings<00:03:24.590> you<00:03:25.100> will<00:03:25.340> pick<00:03:25.550> up

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
we are taking weddings you will pick up

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.300 
we are taking weddings you will pick up
every<00:03:26.090> piece<00:03:26.270> of<00:03:26.630> sound<00:03:27.590> which<00:03:27.800> you<00:03:28.040> don't

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
every piece of sound which you don't

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.670 
every piece of sound which you don't
want<00:03:28.660> so<00:03:29.660> this<00:03:29.990> is<00:03:30.140> a<00:03:30.170> better<00:03:30.530> alternative

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
want so this is a better alternative

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.550 
want so this is a better alternative
than<00:03:31.190> nothing<00:03:31.730> however<00:03:32.420> i<00:03:32.569> would<00:03:32.959> i<00:03:33.440> would

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
than nothing however i would i would

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.060 
than nothing however i would i would
suggest<00:03:33.920> to<00:03:34.340> look<00:03:34.550> even<00:03:34.730> further<00:03:35.270> than<00:03:35.540> that

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
suggest to look even further than that

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.710 
suggest to look even further than that
verily<00:03:37.070> this<00:03:37.190> is<00:03:37.400> good<00:03:37.640> when<00:03:38.030> there's<00:03:38.450> a<00:03:38.570> lot

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
verily this is good when there's a lot

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.570 
verily this is good when there's a lot
of<00:03:38.750> action<00:03:39.140> and<00:03:39.260> you<00:03:39.350> have<00:03:39.650> to<00:03:39.830> run<00:03:40.010> around<00:03:40.160> and

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
of action and you have to run around and

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.400 
of action and you have to run around and
you<00:03:40.790> don't<00:03:40.820> necessarily<00:03:41.209> need<00:03:41.690> to<00:03:42.110> capture

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
you don't necessarily need to capture

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.390 
you don't necessarily need to capture
voices<00:03:42.709> or<00:03:43.340> specific<00:03:44.320> species<00:03:45.320> now<00:03:46.190> i'm<00:03:46.250> going

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
voices or specific species now i'm going

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.590 
voices or specific species now i'm going
to<00:03:46.459> show<00:03:46.610> you<00:03:46.640> in<00:03:46.850> a<00:03:46.910> second<00:03:47.239> one<00:03:47.360> I'm<00:03:47.450> talking

to show you in a second one I'm talking

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.410 
to show you in a second one I'm talking
about<00:03:48.020> now<00:03:48.770> the<00:03:48.830> next<00:03:49.100> step<00:03:49.430> is<00:03:49.790> getting<00:03:50.209> the

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
about now the next step is getting the

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.180 
about now the next step is getting the
right<00:03:50.570> sound<00:03:50.870> is<00:03:51.050> actually<00:03:51.410> to<00:03:51.560> have<00:03:51.739> a<00:03:51.770> remote

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
right sound is actually to have a remote

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.729 
right sound is actually to have a remote
lapel<00:03:52.730> mic<00:03:52.940> so<00:03:53.270> what<00:03:53.420> I<00:03:53.450> have<00:03:53.720> on<00:03:53.750> me<00:03:54.020> I<00:03:54.230> have

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
lapel mic so what I have on me I have

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.699 
lapel mic so what I have on me I have
basically<00:03:55.370> a<00:03:55.700> microphone<00:03:56.390> and<00:03:56.709> the

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
basically a microphone and the

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.620 
basically a microphone and the
transmitter<00:03:58.160> which<00:03:58.790> I'm<00:03:59.030> going<00:03:59.209> to<00:03:59.269> keep<00:03:59.450> it

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
transmitter which I'm going to keep it

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.750 
transmitter which I'm going to keep it
here<00:03:59.900> and<00:04:00.140> they<00:04:00.650> will<00:04:00.800> be<00:04:00.950> also<00:04:01.130> a<00:04:01.310> receiver

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
here and they will be also a receiver

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.160 
here and they will be also a receiver
which<00:04:02.120> is<00:04:02.269> going<00:04:02.450> to<00:04:02.510> be<00:04:02.570> on<00:04:02.720> top<00:04:02.900> of<00:04:02.959> the

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
which is going to be on top of the

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.990 
which is going to be on top of the
camera<00:04:03.380> and<00:04:03.739> it<00:04:03.920> will<00:04:04.070> transmit<00:04:04.400> the<00:04:04.790> sound

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
camera and it will transmit the sound

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.770 
camera and it will transmit the sound
sent<00:04:05.870> by<00:04:06.080> the<00:04:06.560> transmitter<00:04:07.600> taken<00:04:08.600> by<00:04:08.720> the

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
sent by the transmitter taken by the

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.630 
sent by the transmitter taken by the
receiver<00:04:09.230> and<00:04:09.440> go<00:04:09.739> straight<00:04:09.980> into<00:04:10.220> the<00:04:10.280> camera

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
receiver and go straight into the camera

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.720 
receiver and go straight into the camera
as<00:04:11.140> simple<00:04:12.140> as<00:04:12.260> that<00:04:12.290> both<00:04:13.040> of<00:04:13.340> them<00:04:13.489> have

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
as simple as that both of them have

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.640 
as simple as that both of them have
batteries<00:04:14.239> and<00:04:14.780> this<00:04:15.050> is<00:04:15.200> a<00:04:15.230> pretty<00:04:15.500> good

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
batteries and this is a pretty good

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.099 
batteries and this is a pretty good
solution<00:04:16.160> now<00:04:16.640> in<00:04:16.880> my<00:04:17.030> experience<00:04:17.600> you<00:04:17.930> need

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
solution now in my experience you need

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:19.690 
solution now in my experience you need
to<00:04:18.290> pay<00:04:18.620> attention<00:04:18.650> watch<00:04:19.160> your<00:04:19.340> bind<00:04:19.519> because

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
to pay attention watch your bind because

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.690 
to pay attention watch your bind because
the<00:04:20.209> cheap<00:04:20.480> ones<00:04:20.720> which<00:04:21.290> one<00:04:22.280> of<00:04:22.310> them<00:04:22.520> i'm

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
the cheap ones which one of them i'm

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.610 
the cheap ones which one of them i'm
using<00:04:23.030> it<00:04:23.180> right<00:04:23.210> now<00:04:23.360> it's<00:04:23.990> good<00:04:24.260> for<00:04:24.290> what

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
using it right now it's good for what

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:25.719 
using it right now it's good for what

provide some background noise and

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.080 
provide some background noise and

sometimes if i move around it's going to

question<00:04:57.080> is<00:04:57.169> how<00:04:57.500> do<00:04:57.560> you<00:04:57.740> record<00:04:58.160> the

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
question is how do you record the

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.279 
question is how do you record the
ceremony<00:04:58.700> so<00:04:59.060> we<00:04:59.330> came<00:04:59.539> up<00:04:59.570> with<00:04:59.720> the<00:04:59.930> problem

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:00.289 
ceremony so we came up with the problem

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:02.170 
ceremony so we came up with the problem
that<00:05:00.500> if<00:05:00.740> you<00:05:01.010> have<00:05:01.280> all

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
that if you have all

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.210 
that if you have all
one<00:05:02.330> lapel<00:05:02.570> mic<00:05:02.900> it's<00:05:03.110> not<00:05:03.289> going<00:05:03.470> to<00:05:03.560> do<00:05:03.680> so

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
one lapel mic it's not going to do so

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.279 
one lapel mic it's not going to do so
you<00:05:04.310> can<00:05:04.610> record<00:05:04.970> the<00:05:05.240> groom<00:05:05.479> talking<00:05:05.960> or<00:05:06.169> you

you can record the groom talking or you
can<00:05:06.470> record<00:05:06.800> the<00:05:07.100> bright<00:05:07.310> talking<00:05:07.699> you<00:05:08.060> cannot

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
can record the bright talking you cannot

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.779 
can record the bright talking you cannot
recording<00:05:08.900> both<00:05:09.229> of<00:05:09.470> them<00:05:09.650> especially<00:05:10.160> if<00:05:10.699> you

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:10.789 
recording both of them especially if you

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:12.969 
recording both of them especially if you
want<00:05:10.940> to<00:05:11.030> keep<00:05:11.210> the<00:05:11.270> distance<00:05:11.570> a<00:05:11.960> boom<00:05:12.740> might

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
want to keep the distance a boom might

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.550 
want to keep the distance a boom might
might<00:05:13.220> might<00:05:13.250> not<00:05:13.910> be<00:05:14.210> so<00:05:14.690> efficient<00:05:15.259> in<00:05:15.380> that

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
might might not be so efficient in that

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.730 
might might not be so efficient in that
case<00:05:15.800> so<00:05:16.009> what<00:05:16.190> you<00:05:16.310> want<00:05:16.460> to<00:05:16.550> do<00:05:16.699> you<00:05:17.419> use<00:05:17.810> to

case so what you want to do you use to

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.550 
case so what you want to do you use to
lapel<00:05:19.280> mics<00:05:19.520> and<00:05:19.960> how<00:05:20.960> you're<00:05:21.320> going<00:05:21.470> to

lapel mics and how you're going to
actually<00:05:21.770> send<00:05:22.220> the<00:05:23.020> sound<00:05:24.020> into<00:05:24.259> the<00:05:24.380> camera

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
actually send the sound into the camera

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.010 
actually send the sound into the camera
well<00:05:25.190> you<00:05:25.669> need<00:05:25.820> to<00:05:25.910> purchase<00:05:26.120> a<00:05:26.419> sound<00:05:26.810> mixer

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
well you need to purchase a sound mixer

well you need to purchase a sound mixer
so<00:05:27.680> that's<00:05:27.919> another<00:05:28.280> type<00:05:28.880> of<00:05:28.910> equipment<00:05:29.360> this

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
so that's another type of equipment this

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.390 
so that's another type of equipment this
is<00:05:30.289> a<00:05:30.320> tascam<00:05:30.919> linear<00:05:31.550> PCM<00:05:31.759> recorder<00:05:32.979> 60d<00:05:33.979> mark

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
is a tascam linear PCM recorder 60d mark

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.909 
is a tascam linear PCM recorder 60d mark
two<00:05:34.729> it's<00:05:35.479> irrelevant<00:05:35.810> that<00:05:36.229> many<00:05:36.470> brands<00:05:36.740> out

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:22.729 
this is good as a backup and also it's

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:24.520 
this is good as a backup and also it's
good<00:06:22.909> as<00:06:23.030> a<00:06:23.060> mixer<00:06:23.479> you<00:06:23.720> will<00:06:23.840> not<00:06:24.020> be<00:06:24.169> able<00:06:24.199> to

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:24.530 
good as a mixer you will not be able to

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.640 
good as a mixer you will not be able to
do<00:06:25.419> anything<00:06:26.419> like<00:06:26.659> that<00:06:26.720> otherwise<00:06:27.229> because

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:27.650 
do anything like that otherwise because

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:29.510 
the camera has only one jack so camera

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.659 
the camera has only one jack so camera
is<00:06:29.630> not<00:06:29.870> designed<00:06:30.260> to<00:06:30.380> deal<00:06:31.099> with<00:06:31.310> several

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:31.669 
is not designed to deal with several

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:33.339 
is not designed to deal with several
channels<00:06:31.909> but<00:06:32.300> this<00:06:32.479> one<00:06:32.659> will<00:06:32.810> help<00:06:32.990> you<00:06:33.199> to
