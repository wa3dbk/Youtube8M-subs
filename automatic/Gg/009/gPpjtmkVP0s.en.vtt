00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:10.160
 you are able to commercialize a descendant of a dinosaur 6 and the truth is that already 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.520
 you have done all paleontologists today we agree that 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.990
 the birds are the descendants of the azcona dinosaurs incredible truth 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.850
 everything started in 1888 with a renowned scientist thomas j 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.210
 the man found himself throughout the morning trying to figure out in what 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.640
 part of the body belonged to the congress that lacava come from a recent 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.960
 excavation 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.750
 all morning he was thinking to what part of the body he belonged according to that 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.990
 writing lunch had some rubbery inns and so much thinking and 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.910
 so much to eat 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.460
 and he choked on a throat and when the children took him out 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.460
 according to his separation a lot of bone that had him delivered throughout the morning 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.910
 from there the scientists agree the found hundreds of tests 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.360
 possible sources kinship among birds among the favorites 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:02.020
 kinship for example in external characteristics 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.460
 the losses by the forms of the legs come to three internal strips as 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.510
 the purple 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.869
 in question where the clavicles meet 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.150
 since curiously it belongs only to birds 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.710
 and the dinosaurs 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.750
 in fact today we know that between birds and dinosaurs share more than 85 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.750
 anatomical features by then 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.490
 a question arises 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.080
 as a Nobel Prize 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.670
 There are two tournaments but the most successful says after a long process 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.120
 latest 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.320
 The guerrillas 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.509
 at the beginning your motion to protect yourself from the cold 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.809
 but the active rivers when looking for your partner 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.660
 it seems that the numbers to fly 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.820
 then the young guys started running to catch their prey and 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.110
 also to escape predators 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.270
 in both their relationship when they started to give more speed and 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.260
 began to take small jumps and thanks to the feathers could be maintained 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.340
 more time in the air 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.630
 according to very intimate long process of many millions and millions of years to 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.699
 that the first many feathered dinosaurs 

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:11.459
 after paying 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.419
 Nestor is so calm commented 

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:14.699
 Jorge bergoglio
