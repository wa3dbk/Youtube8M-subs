00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
brakes ended up doing all of the work

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.670 
brakes ended up doing all of the work
which<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.850> would<00:01:57.240> say<00:01:57.420> has<00:01:57.570> closed<00:01:57.869> up<00:01:58.140> the

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
which I would say has closed up the

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.740 
which I would say has closed up the
linings<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.340> therefore<00:02:00.299> reduce<00:02:00.600> the

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
linings and therefore reduce the

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.149 
linings and therefore reduce the
efficiency<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.290> brakes<00:02:01.500> even<00:02:01.680> more<00:02:01.950> so

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
efficiency of the brakes even more so

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.039 
efficiency of the brakes even more so
we'll<00:02:02.820> just<00:02:03.030> these<00:02:03.210> up<00:02:03.450> we'll<00:02:03.689> give<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:03.930> bit

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
we'll just these up we'll give it a bit

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.249 
we'll just these up we'll give it a bit
of<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.200> test<00:02:04.409> drive<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:04.799> see<00:02:04.860> how<00:02:05.159> it<00:02:05.310> goes<00:02:06.259> okay

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
of a test drive and see how it goes okay

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.080 
of a test drive and see how it goes okay
so<00:02:07.469> I<00:02:07.649> just<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:08.039> up<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.250> rear<00:02:08.489> I<00:02:08.700> did<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.060> a

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
so I just it up the rear I did it a

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.279 
so I just it up the rear I did it a
little<00:02:09.239> bit<00:02:09.479> tighter<00:02:09.629> than<00:02:09.840> I<00:02:09.989> should<00:02:10.170> off

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
little bit tighter than I should off

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.740 
little bit tighter than I should off
just<00:02:10.470> stop<00:02:10.649> but<00:02:10.860> maybe<00:02:11.190> hopefully<00:02:11.459> we<00:02:11.730> can<00:02:11.879> bed

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
just stop but maybe hopefully we can bed

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.860 
just stop but maybe hopefully we can bed
the<00:02:12.900> pads<00:02:13.110> in<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.319> little<00:02:13.500> bit<00:02:13.620> back

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
the pads in a little bit back

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.890 
the pads in a little bit back
into<00:02:14.019> shape<00:02:14.230> but<00:02:15.220> I<00:02:15.760> don't<00:02:16.599> like<00:02:16.720> our<00:02:16.870> chances

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
into shape but I don't like our chances

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:17.610 
into shape but I don't like our chances
of<00:02:17.260> that

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
of that

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.979

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
anyway let's see how these boats feel

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.670 
anyway let's see how these boats feel
got<00:03:12.040> enough<00:03:12.280> air<00:03:12.549> now<00:03:12.760> yep

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.509

now<00:04:35.910> as<00:04:36.090> soon<00:04:36.240> as<00:04:36.360> you<00:04:36.510> apply<00:04:36.630> the<00:04:36.840> turtle<00:04:37.260> it's

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
now as soon as you apply the turtle it's

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.860 
now as soon as you apply the turtle it's
getting<00:04:38.370> it's<00:04:38.910> getting<00:04:38.970> air<00:04:39.330> to<00:04:39.540> the<00:04:39.630> brakes

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
getting it's getting air to the brakes

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.210 
getting it's getting air to the brakes
straightaway<00:04:40.350> they're<00:04:40.530> getting<00:04:40.770> straight<00:04:41.070> to

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
straightaway they're getting straight to

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.880 
straightaway they're getting straight to
that<00:04:41.330> the<00:04:42.330> shoes<00:04:43.170> are<00:04:43.320> getting<00:04:43.530> straight<00:04:43.770> at

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
the drum but before such a delay there's

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.400 
the drum but before such a delay there's
sinkers<00:04:48.120> of<00:04:48.210> it<00:04:48.570> on<00:04:48.660> second

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.350 

go<00:04:53.950> back<00:04:54.130> the<00:04:54.280> other<00:04:54.430> way<00:04:54.460> yeah

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.270 

Plus<00:04:58.960> have<00:04:59.139> quite<00:04:59.469> an<00:04:59.650> overhanging<00:05:00.099> this

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
Plus have quite an overhanging this

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:06.119 
Plus have quite an overhanging this
truck<00:05:00.629> does<00:05:01.629> have<00:05:01.810> quite<00:05:02.080> an<00:05:02.289> overhead<00:05:02.680> so<00:05:05.129> at

00:05:06.119 --> 00:05:06.129 
truck does have quite an overhead so at

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
wheels so the back wheels do actually do

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:20.209 
wheels so the back wheels do actually do
nearly<00:05:14.229> all<00:05:14.469> of<00:05:14.500> them<00:05:16.169> first<00:05:17.259> there<00:05:17.500> you<00:05:17.590> go
