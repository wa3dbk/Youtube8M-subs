00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
makes a good work environment I think a

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.090 
makes a good work environment I think a
good<00:03:43.540> work<00:03:43.750> environment<00:03:43.930> consists<00:03:44.590> of<00:03:44.709> staff

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
good work environment consists of staff

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.220 
good work environment consists of staff
members<00:03:45.310> supporting<00:03:45.940> each<00:03:46.060> other<00:03:46.269> not<00:03:47.200> a

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
members supporting each other not a

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.440 
members supporting each other not a
hostile<00:03:47.680> environment<00:03:47.890> it's<00:03:48.489> really<00:03:48.549> making

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
hostile environment it's really making

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:50.550 
hostile environment it's really making
sure<00:03:49.570> that<00:03:49.690> they're<00:03:49.870> safe<00:03:49.900> and<00:03:50.290> what<00:03:50.440> they're

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
sure that they're safe and what they're

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.800 
sure that they're safe and what they're
doing<00:03:50.590> okay<00:03:51.280> if<00:03:51.760> the<00:03:51.880> employee<00:03:52.180> isn't<00:03:52.390> happy

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
doing okay if the employee isn't happy

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.449 
doing okay if the employee isn't happy
if<00:03:52.930> they're<00:03:53.080> not<00:03:53.200> feeling<00:03:53.440> safe<00:03:53.799> they<00:03:54.190> won't

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
if they're not feeling safe they won't

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.610 
if they're not feeling safe they won't
reciprocate<00:03:55.239> that<00:03:55.269> with<00:03:55.570> their<00:03:55.690> job<00:03:55.900> and<00:03:56.110> the

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
reciprocate that with their job and the

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.229 
reciprocate that with their job and the
quality<00:03:57.070> of<00:03:57.160> their<00:03:57.280> work<00:03:57.310> will<00:03:57.610> drop<00:03:57.820> so<00:03:58.090> it's

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
quality of their work will drop so it's

00:03:58.239 --> 00:03:59.460 
quality of their work will drop so it's
really<00:03:58.450> making<00:03:58.600> sure<00:03:58.780> that<00:03:58.900> they're<00:03:59.170> happy

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
really making sure that they're happy

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:00.390 
really making sure that they're happy
