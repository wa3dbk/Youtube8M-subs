00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:12.780
 Welcome to the video post 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.940
 the nasa h of rc heli action this 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.820
 contribution as an addition to the 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.830
 eponymous article simply because itself 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.830
 flight performance in word and picture always 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.869
 limited good description still leaves 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.760
 Just a short reminder of the feature 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.660
 nasa h consists essentially of four 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.619
 It is one of these components 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.899
 controller here 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.600
 all the intelligence sits in here 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:40.020
 and also the acceleration sensors and 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.350
 the office sensors are there 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.600
 here this remote led has as 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.579
 essential feature of a computer 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.590
 connection and you can tell already here 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.940
 NASA does not emanate from the sender 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.250
 configured but needs because 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.710
 actually a pc, however, is the 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.149
 user guidance albeit very English 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.289
 very well done so that you look 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.899
 is doing well enough here 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.369
 This site has an optional GPS 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.110
 unit also one more 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.330
 magnetic compass includes 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.460
 it actually makes little sense that 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.270
 overall system without this feature too 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.780
 operate 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.610
 simply because this gps hold function 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.350
 one of the essential strengths of nasa 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.049
 means that we will see soon 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.729
 as fourth and also optional 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.100
 Building block you can see down here 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.340
 so-called power management unit that is 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.759
 nothing more than a pc system so that 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.210
 so the whole recipient 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.890
 power supply and also the 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.979
 voltage supply of nasa 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.460
 ensure systems from the bike 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.680
 can 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.649
 In principle, each works well 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.509
 drive system is just as good 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.880
 the advantage of the power management unit 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.920
 just that one at a time 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.649
 relaxation sensor with integrated has 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.189
 and wet hair can then start from one in 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.200
 Computer selectable lower limit in the under 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:02.310
 Voltage warning about this 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.719
 led here by telemetry on the transmitter with on 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.250
 board has for this is this feature 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.229
 maybe not useful 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.360
 for everyone else it's a nice thing 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.060
 and pc systems in the helicopter needs 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.800
 you probably anyway so you can 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.620
 actually 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.540
 also same for this system 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.310
 I'll say good 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.210
 Let's look at the basic features 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.210
 sometimes in flight 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.420
 after initialization you can in 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.550
 take manual mode off 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.440
 the system is also completely 3d capable 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.160
 and behaves like a normal stay 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.160
 everything helicopter 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.760
 and here you can switch over 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:46.050
 after a team mode immediately adjusts 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:50.599
 the model horizontally from a likewise 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.599
 existing ride is retained 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.780
 and here in the overlay you can see 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.990
 the principle of the maximum inclination of the 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:08.190
 helicopter both while accelerating 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.190
 as well as while braking 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.290
 Note that in all these maneuvers 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.180
 pitch is not touched 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.770
 one presses it now with nick against it 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.150
 to decelerate faster 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.610
 reach builds the machine 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:25.560
 principle height on it tries 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.560
 However, the self-degrade again 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.320
 The model has a hover over here 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:38.600
 Light weather conditions due to wind 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:41.960
 switch to the apps mode 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.330
 The model stays stable immediately 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.730
 Position control is remarkable above all 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.040
 insofar as gps only about ten meters 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.780
 exactly is the other sensors speak 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:55.820
 from nasa do a very good job here 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.480
 here is only with cyclic functions 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.730
 controlled 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.610
 namely with nic cage is not touched 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.470
 you can see nasa trying to let go 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.830
 The stick immediately to the position 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.730
 hold and the exit height again 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.800
 adjust 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.050
 in gps mode again the same 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:16.489
 principle as in a team mode you press 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:19.160
 with nick around the ride faster 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.650
 then dismantle the machine as well 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.640
 temporary height on tries but himself 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.640
 to reduce these again 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.930
 pitt responded slightly delayed that 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.370
 depends on the speed you fly 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.169
 and of course the weight of the 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.570
 helicopter at camera helicopters 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:38.180
 the heavy ones can do that 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:41.570
 from belang be here finally 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:44.950
 the maximum rate of the tail but for 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.950
 all cases are sufficient 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.700
 si
