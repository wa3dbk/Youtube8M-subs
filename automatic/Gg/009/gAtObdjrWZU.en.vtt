enough to make it interesting add a

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.800 
enough to make it interesting add a
little<00:02:28.270> contrast<00:02:28.860> since<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:30.100> cream<00:02:30.540> base<00:02:31.540> is

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810

use color putty beige to add just a
little<00:03:08.340> darkness<00:03:09.340> to<00:03:09.519> the<00:03:09.640> bottom<00:03:09.940> of<00:03:10.060> the

little darkness to the bottom of the

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:17.670 
little darkness to the bottom of the
clouds<00:03:10.390> and<00:03:10.600> shadows<00:03:11.079> down<00:03:11.320> there<00:03:16.530> give<00:03:17.530> you<00:03:17.650> a

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
clouds and shadows down there give you a

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.229 
clouds and shadows down there give you a
close-up<00:03:18.280> so<00:03:18.310> you<00:03:18.640> can<00:03:18.820> just<00:03:18.940> sort<00:03:19.180> of

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
close-up so you can just sort of

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.340 
close-up so you can just sort of
scribble<00:03:20.019> it<00:03:20.140> in<00:03:20.290> a<00:03:20.380> little<00:03:20.590> bit<00:03:22.320> all<00:03:23.320> right

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
scribble it in a little bit all right

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.890 
scribble it in a little bit all right
now<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:23.650> fun<00:03:23.920> starts<00:03:23.980> I<00:03:26.070> use<00:03:27.070> orange<00:03:27.610> and<00:03:27.970> work

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
now the fun starts I use orange and work

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.620 
now the fun starts I use orange and work
