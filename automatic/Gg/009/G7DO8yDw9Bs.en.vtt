00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:07.910
 let's prepare with the thermomix 

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.910
 Ensaimada the ingredients are 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.740
 preparation mother dough 50 grams of water 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.489
 tempered 10 grams of pressed yeast 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.349
 fresh 90 grams of strength flour 

00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:23.710
 for the preparation of spear dough 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:27.250
 imada 100 grams of water 75 grams of 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:32.289
 sugar 2 eggs 50 grams of butter 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:34.660
 pork 150 grams of the sourdough 410 of 

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:38.829
 half a teaspoon strength flour 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:41.290
 salt 2 tablespoons olive oil for 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:44.940
 paint the ensaimadas 100 grams of 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.940
 melted lard 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.789
 to start melting the 100 grams 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.149
 of lard a few minutes in the 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.149
 microwave oven 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.780
 we prepare the sourdough in the glass of 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.199
 the thermomix we put the warm water and 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.199
 yeast 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:11.980
 then we will program 10 seconds 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.980
 speed 3 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:22.710
 After this time we added the 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:26.369
 90 grams of flour and amass a minute 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.369
 speed 3 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.930
 Once ready we take out the dough forming 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.930
 a ball 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.509
 and we leave it in a bowl covered with water 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.020
 tempered 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:59.479
 when the float mass will be ready this 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.479
 it will take approximately 15 minutes 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.289
 then we introduce the water 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.149
 the sugar 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:17.550
 two eggs 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.550
 lard 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.170
 150 grams of the sourdough 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.470
 the flour 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:47.130
 add the teaspoon of salt and 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.130
 we program 30 seconds speed 6 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:55.989
 once the first 30 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:03:01.440
 seconds we re-program three 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:01.440
 Tang closed cup speed 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:11.410
 we re-program three minutes glasses 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:14.800
 closed spike speed and with the 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:19.410
 machine in motion we add the two 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.410
 tablespoons of oil through the vowel 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:28.709
 we paint a baking paper with the 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.709
 melted butter in the microwave 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:37.440
 we have fun the dough 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:42.030
 then we divide the mass into 20 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:45.440
 balls of about 40 grams each 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.440
 more or less 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:52.230
 we go dipping our hands with oil 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.680
 so that we do not stick the dough to the 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.680
 hands 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:04.380
 we are extending each of the balls 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.380
 as fine as possible 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:12.109
 to then roll the dough in shape 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.109
 of cylinder 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:33.060
 then we stretch it a little bit 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:36.180
 the ends and we deposit it turning in 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:39.139
 form of ensaimadas leaving a bit of 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.560
 separation in each round 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:44.030
 once we have them in the tray 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.860
 we must keep them in one place 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.860
 warm for about 10 hours 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:55.520
 We preheat the oven to 180 degrees 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:05:00.099
 approximately 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:04.629
 after 10 or 15 minutes at 180 degrees 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:04.629
 we will have our tickets 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:12.270
 Now helping a strainer him 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.270
 we put the icing sugar 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:20.610
 At the end we let them cool and now 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.610
 we have ready to eat
