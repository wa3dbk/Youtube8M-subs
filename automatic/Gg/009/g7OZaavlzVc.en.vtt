was watchdogs and I bought that game
with<00:02:20.709> my<00:02:20.799> peers<00:02:21.040> for<00:02:21.280> and<00:02:21.780> so<00:02:22.780> it<00:02:22.840> has<00:02:22.989> been

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
with my peers for and so it has been

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.949 
with my peers for and so it has been
quite<00:02:23.319> a<00:02:23.440> long<00:02:23.530> time<00:02:23.680> since<00:02:24.220> I<00:02:24.459> have<00:02:24.819> felt<00:02:25.480> get

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
quite a long time since I have felt get

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.199 
quite a long time since I have felt get
out<00:02:26.049> the<00:02:26.140> way<00:02:26.400> it's<00:02:27.400> been<00:02:27.489> quite<00:02:27.819> a<00:02:27.849> long<00:02:28.060> time

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
out the way it's been quite a long time

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.300 
out the way it's been quite a long time
since<00:02:28.750> about<00:02:28.930> a<00:02:28.989> game<00:02:29.200> where<00:02:29.470> I<00:02:29.500> just<00:02:29.829> like<00:02:30.099> you

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
since about a game where I just like you

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.650 
since about a game where I just like you
know<00:02:30.459> constantly<00:02:31.390> want<00:02:31.900> to<00:02:32.049> play<00:02:32.230> it<00:02:32.440> I<00:02:33.660> think

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
know constantly want to play it I think

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.259 
know constantly want to play it I think
it's<00:02:34.780> pretty<00:02:34.930> safe<00:02:35.140> to<00:02:35.200> say<00:02:35.349> grid<00:02:36.310> has<00:02:36.610> filled

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
it's pretty safe to say grid has filled

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.630 
it's pretty safe to say grid has filled
that<00:02:37.569> void<00:02:37.599> and<00:02:38.260> at<00:02:39.190> least<00:02:39.370> for<00:02:39.610> now

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
that void and at least for now

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.280 
that void and at least for now
especially<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.239> concern<00:02:40.510> is<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:40.780> last<00:02:40.959> gen<00:02:41.260> I

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
especially the concern is the last gen I

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.000
