book I was just amazed to see how much
creativity<00:01:47.220> went<00:01:47.490> into<00:01:47.790> creating<00:01:48.299> these

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
creativity went into creating these

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.030 
creativity went into creating these
8-bit<00:01:49.729> sprites<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.329> this<00:01:52.020> book<00:01:52.229> just<00:01:52.799> takes

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
8-bit sprites and this book just takes

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.460 
8-bit sprites and this book just takes
that<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.119> next<00:01:54.329> level<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.140> figured<00:01:55.380> we

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
that to the next level so I figured we

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.590 
that to the next level so I figured we
just<00:01:55.649> show<00:01:55.799> off<00:01:56.009> some<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.460> pages<00:01:57.090> here<00:01:57.540> you

just<00:02:20.799> 8-bit<00:02:21.340> sprites<00:02:21.700> but<00:02:21.879> I<00:02:22.000> think<00:02:22.620> this<00:02:24.720> sort

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
just 8-bit sprites but I think this sort

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.100 
just 8-bit sprites but I think this sort
of<00:02:25.780> meticulous<00:02:26.410> approach<00:02:26.560> allowed<00:02:28.110> these

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
of meticulous approach allowed these

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.050

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
8-bit limitations of the platform so

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.089
