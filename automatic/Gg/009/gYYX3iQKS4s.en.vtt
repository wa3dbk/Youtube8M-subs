00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
here you can see what I think is

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.149 
here you can see what I think is
supposed<00:01:23.659> to<00:01:23.840> be<00:01:24.049> a<00:01:24.079> velociraptor<00:01:24.889> but<00:01:25.039> it's

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
supposed to be a velociraptor but it's

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.879 
supposed to be a velociraptor but it's
not<00:01:25.340> it's<00:01:25.490> actually<00:01:25.639> a<00:01:25.880> t-rex<00:01:26.740> attacking<00:01:27.740> the

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:27.889 
not it's actually a t-rex attacking the

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:30.910 
not it's actually a t-rex attacking the
Brachiosaurus<00:01:28.249> and<00:01:29.289> as<00:01:30.289> you<00:01:30.439> can<00:01:30.560> see<00:01:30.619> it's

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
Brachiosaurus and as you can see it's

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.199 
Brachiosaurus and as you can see it's
Brachiosaurus<00:01:31.670> and<00:01:31.819> Velociraptor<00:01:33.039> so

00:01:34.199 --> 00:01:34.209 
Brachiosaurus and Velociraptor so

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:36.399 
Brachiosaurus and Velociraptor so
something's<00:01:35.209> gone<00:01:35.389> on<00:01:35.569> here<00:01:35.990> where<00:01:36.200> they've

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
something's gone on here where they've

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.349 
something's gone on here where they've
got<00:01:36.649> the<00:01:36.829> colors<00:01:37.340> mixed<00:01:38.029> up<00:01:38.149> with<00:01:38.299> the

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:38.359 
got the colors mixed up with the

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:40.809 
got the colors mixed up with the
dinosaurs<00:01:39.549> because<00:01:40.549> they've<00:01:40.700> obviously

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:40.819 
dinosaurs because they've obviously

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:42.969 
dinosaurs because they've obviously
tried<00:01:41.209> to<00:01:41.329> match<00:01:41.539> this<00:01:41.749> art<00:01:42.049> card<00:01:42.380> but<00:01:42.799> then

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
tried to match this art card but then

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:44.319 
tried to match this art card but then
they've<00:01:43.159> put<00:01:43.369> the<00:01:43.459> color<00:01:43.669> scheme<00:01:43.999> on<00:01:44.029> the

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
they've put the color scheme on the

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:47.349 
they've put the color scheme on the
Raptor<00:01:44.779> and<00:01:44.990> this<00:01:45.619> is<00:01:45.740> definitely<00:01:46.039> a<00:01:46.159> t-rex<00:01:46.639> so

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:47.359 
Raptor and this is definitely a t-rex so

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:49.749 
Raptor and this is definitely a t-rex so
there's<00:01:48.109> been<00:01:48.259> a<00:01:48.289> little<00:01:48.469> bit<00:01:48.740> of<00:01:48.859> a<00:01:49.009> you<00:01:49.729> know

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
there's been a little bit of a you know

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:51.789 
there's been a little bit of a you know
a<00:01:49.849> little<00:01:50.090> bit<00:01:50.149> of<00:01:50.270> confusion<00:01:50.810> there<00:01:51.020> but<00:01:51.229> the

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
a little bit of confusion there but the

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.529 
a little bit of confusion there but the
sculpts<00:01:52.219> are<00:01:52.340> still<00:01:52.579> very<00:01:52.789> very<00:01:53.029> good<00:01:53.149> and<00:01:53.479> the

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
sculpts are still very very good and the

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:55.979 
sculpts are still very very good and the
Brachiosaurus<00:01:53.899> the<00:01:54.799> coloration<00:01:55.399> is<00:01:55.549> correct

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:55.989 
Brachiosaurus the coloration is correct

00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:58.330 
Brachiosaurus the coloration is correct
let's<00:01:56.989> get<00:01:57.169> a<00:01:57.200> closer<00:01:57.499> look<00:01:57.799> at<00:01:57.979> them<00:01:58.099> in<00:01:58.249> the

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
let's get a closer look at them in the

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.739 
let's get a closer look at them in the
packaging<00:01:59.679> so<00:02:00.759> very<00:02:01.759> nice<00:02:01.999> sculpts<00:02:02.479> you<00:02:02.569> can

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:02.749 
packaging so very nice sculpts you can

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:04.899 
packaging so very nice sculpts you can
see<00:02:02.929> the<00:02:03.049> Jurassic<00:02:03.499> Park<00:02:03.739> logo<00:02:04.310> there<00:02:04.579> on<00:02:04.789> the

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
see the Jurassic Park logo there on the

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.239 
see the Jurassic Park logo there on the
base<00:02:05.119> and<00:02:05.509> all<00:02:06.439> of<00:02:06.590> them<00:02:06.739> came<00:02:06.919> with<00:02:07.099> these

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:07.249 
base and all of them came with these

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:09.790 
base and all of them came with these
little<00:02:07.399> diecast<00:02:07.939> base<00:02:08.210> is<00:02:08.479> diecast<00:02:09.259> metal<00:02:09.500> the

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
little diecast base is diecast metal the

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.100 
little diecast base is diecast metal the
whole<00:02:09.830> thing<00:02:10.310> and<00:02:10.580> it<00:02:11.150> seems<00:02:11.510> to<00:02:11.570> be<00:02:11.720> painted

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
whole thing and it seems to be painted

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.480 
whole thing and it seems to be painted
with<00:02:12.260> sort<00:02:12.440> of<00:02:12.470> matt<00:02:12.770> enamel

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
with sort of matt enamel

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.880 
with sort of matt enamel
paints<00:02:13.880> so<00:02:14.630> there's<00:02:14.810> no<00:02:14.930> sort<00:02:15.170> of<00:02:15.260> gradiation

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
paints so there's no sort of gradiation

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.530 
paints so there's no sort of gradiation
from<00:02:16.280> one<00:02:16.460> color<00:02:16.730> to<00:02:16.820> the<00:02:17.000> other<00:02:17.030> it's<00:02:17.330> just

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
from one color to the other it's just

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.400 
from one color to the other it's just
solid<00:02:18.140> block<00:02:18.650> colors<00:02:19.840> but<00:02:20.840> yeah<00:02:21.020> it's<00:02:21.170> quite<00:02:21.380> a

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
solid block colors but yeah it's quite a

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.760 
solid block colors but yeah it's quite a
nice<00:02:21.590> sculpt<00:02:22.130> quite<00:02:22.670> detailed<00:02:23.470> it<00:02:24.470> does

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
nice sculpt quite detailed it does

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.790 
nice sculpt quite detailed it does
suffer<00:02:25.250> a<00:02:25.280> little<00:02:25.490> bit<00:02:25.670> from<00:02:26.650> softening<00:02:27.650> of

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
suffer a little bit from softening of

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.400 
suffer a little bit from softening of
the<00:02:27.890> details<00:02:28.340> a<00:02:28.520> little<00:02:28.760> bit<00:02:29.080> you<00:02:30.080> do<00:02:30.230> feel

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
the details a little bit you do feel

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.660 
the details a little bit you do feel
that<00:02:30.590> maybe<00:02:30.710> the<00:02:30.860> original<00:02:31.220> scope<00:02:31.430> was<00:02:31.640> a

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
that maybe the original scope was a

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.520 
that maybe the original scope was a
little<00:02:32.000> bit<00:02:32.120> more<00:02:32.270> detailed<00:02:32.690> but<00:02:32.870> for<00:02:33.020> for

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
little bit more detailed but for for

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.570 
little bit more detailed but for for
1993<00:02:34.280> this<00:02:34.400> is<00:02:34.550> still<00:02:34.820> very<00:02:35.090> very<00:02:35.300> good<00:02:36.580> okay

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
1993 this is still very very good okay

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.230 
1993 this is still very very good okay
and<00:02:37.730> over<00:02:37.850> to<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.150> Raptor<00:02:38.600> so<00:02:39.560> you<00:02:39.620> can<00:02:39.920> see<00:02:40.240> it

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
and over to the Raptor so you can see it

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.030 
and over to the Raptor so you can see it
sort<00:02:41.630> of<00:02:41.690> matches<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:42.140> coloration<00:02:42.740> of<00:02:42.830> the

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
sort of matches the coloration of the

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.900 
sort of matches the coloration of the
brown<00:02:43.790> Raptor<00:02:44.420> toy<00:02:45.220> but<00:02:46.220> it<00:02:46.340> is<00:02:46.430> verging<00:02:46.820> on

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
brown Raptor toy but it is verging on

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.910 
brown Raptor toy but it is verging on
red<00:02:47.240> so<00:02:47.540> I'm<00:02:47.660> just<00:02:47.870> assuming<00:02:48.050> that<00:02:48.740> they've

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
red so I'm just assuming that they've

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.640 
red so I'm just assuming that they've
they've<00:02:49.580> made<00:02:49.790> a<00:02:49.820> mistake<00:02:49.910> there<00:02:50.690> I<00:02:50.930> mean<00:02:51.560> I

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
they've made a mistake there I mean I

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.440 
they've made a mistake there I mean I
don't<00:02:51.710> know<00:02:52.040> it<00:02:52.400> may<00:02:52.580> be<00:02:52.640> that<00:02:52.820> it<00:02:53.120> wasn't

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
don't know it may be that it wasn't

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.930 
don't know it may be that it wasn't
intended<00:02:53.870> to<00:02:54.020> be<00:02:54.110> brown<00:02:54.500> in<00:02:55.250> which<00:02:55.460> case<00:02:55.700> it's

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
intended to be brown in which case it's

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.020 
intended to be brown in which case it's
matching<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.480> concept<00:02:57.260> artwork<00:02:57.680> on<00:02:58.610> the<00:02:58.820> base

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
matching the concept artwork on the base

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.680 
matching the concept artwork on the base
of<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.330> Raptors<00:02:59.830> stand<00:03:00.830> you've<00:03:01.010> got<00:03:01.160> some

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
of the Raptors stand you've got some

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.110 
of the Raptors stand you've got some
sort<00:03:02.690> of<00:03:02.810> it<00:03:02.960> looks<00:03:03.260> like<00:03:03.620> a<00:03:04.070> diamond<00:03:04.850> Troad

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
sort of it looks like a diamond Troad

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.260 
sort of it looks like a diamond Troad
and<00:03:05.650> yeah<00:03:06.650> I<00:03:06.680> think<00:03:06.950> it's<00:03:07.100> the<00:03:07.640> skeleton<00:03:08.090> of<00:03:08.210> a

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
and yeah I think it's the skeleton of a

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.830 
and yeah I think it's the skeleton of a
dime<00:03:08.480> trodden<00:03:09.220> that<00:03:10.220> it<00:03:10.340> stood<00:03:10.640> on<00:03:10.730> so<00:03:11.600> quite<00:03:11.810> a

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
I like about this is that the fact that

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.280 
I like about this is that the fact that
they've<00:04:47.430> really<00:04:48.060> they've<00:04:48.540> stuck<00:04:48.960> with<00:04:49.200> the

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
they've really they've stuck with the

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.470 
they've really they've stuck with the
consistency<00:04:49.860> of<00:04:50.040> all<00:04:50.220> their<00:04:50.430> other<00:04:50.580> Jurassic

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
consistency of all their other Jurassic

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.430 
consistency of all their other Jurassic
Park<00:04:51.690> a<00:04:51.900> series<00:04:52.350> modern<00:04:52.650> toys<00:04:53.870> it<00:04:54.870> matches<00:04:55.290> the

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
color scheme and the design of the

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:58.820 
color scheme and the design of the
packaging<00:04:57.270> exactly<00:04:57.810> so<00:04:58.110> it<00:04:58.560> would<00:04:58.740> have

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
packaging exactly so it would have

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.440 
packaging exactly so it would have
looked<00:04:58.950> really<00:04:59.400> nice<00:04:59.520> on<00:04:59.790> the<00:04:59.880> shelves<00:05:00.270> next

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
so yeah and this was originally fifty

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.200 
so yeah and this was originally fifty
nine<00:05:08.460> pence<00:05:08.900> which<00:05:09.900> is<00:05:10.280> well<00:05:11.280> it's<00:05:11.550> it's<00:05:11.970> less

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
nine pence which is well it's it's less

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.350 
nine pence which is well it's it's less
than<00:05:12.419> a<00:05:12.540> dollar<00:05:12.720> it's<00:05:13.850> well<00:05:14.850> actually<00:05:15.120> it

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
than a dollar it's well actually it

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.260 
than a dollar it's well actually it
might<00:05:15.540> be<00:05:15.720> around<00:05:15.990> about<00:05:16.169> a<00:05:16.230> dollar<00:05:17.060> but<00:05:18.060> this

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
might be around about a dollar but this

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.060 
might be around about a dollar but this
must<00:05:18.510> have<00:05:18.660> been<00:05:18.810> in<00:05:18.870> the<00:05:19.110> stage<00:05:19.350> when<00:05:19.680> these

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
must have been in the stage when these

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.000 
must have been in the stage when these
things<00:05:20.310> weren't<00:05:20.580> selling<00:05:21.150> probably<00:05:22.010> 1994-95

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
things weren't selling probably 1994-95

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.030 
things weren't selling probably 1994-95
and<00:05:23.780> they<00:05:24.780> went<00:05:24.960> in<00:05:25.080> the<00:05:25.140> discount<00:05:25.620> bin<00:05:25.680> for

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
and they went in the discount bin for

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.670 
and they went in the discount bin for
59p<00:05:26.790> and<00:05:27.360> now<00:05:27.810> they've<00:05:28.020> gone<00:05:28.200> up<00:05:28.380> to<00:05:28.530> being

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
59p and now they've gone up to being

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.220 
59p and now they've gone up to being
collectible<00:05:29.310> again<00:05:29.580> so<00:05:30.150> they're<00:05:31.020> probably

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.230 
collectible again so they're probably

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.110 
collectible again so they're probably
more<00:05:31.530> expensive<00:05:31.770> now<00:05:32.280> than<00:05:32.490> they<00:05:32.640> were<00:05:32.669> on<00:05:32.850> the

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
more expensive now than they were on the

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.890 
more expensive now than they were on the
shelves<00:05:33.330> originally<00:05:34.160> so<00:05:35.300> yeah<00:05:36.300> really

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900
