00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.960
 that is, the beginning of the century it all did not care 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.570

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:22.049
 this land turned out to be very spoiled 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:24.869

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.350
 then this factory was torn down empty 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.570
 for a long time and then they decided that you 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.570

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.549
