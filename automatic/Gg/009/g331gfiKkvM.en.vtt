it was really straightforward and easy

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.090 
it was really straightforward and easy
so<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.690> thought<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.260> they<00:00:58.410> said<00:00:58.649> just<00:00:58.920> go

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
so I thought and they said just go

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.950 
so I thought and they said just go
confirm<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.910> you're<00:01:00.030> all<00:01:00.149> cleared<00:01:00.480> out<00:01:00.629> and

confirm that you're all cleared out and

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.889 
confirm that you're all cleared out and
then<00:01:01.590> you're<00:01:01.770> good<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:02.670> go<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.449> sit<00:01:03.719> and

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
then you're good so I go and sit and

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.320 
then you're good so I go and sit and
that's<00:01:04.110> when<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.589> started<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.010> get<00:01:05.159> messy<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:06.299> I

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
that's when it started to get messy so I

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.030 
that's when it started to get messy so I
SAT<00:01:06.720> there<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:09.409> whoever<00:01:10.409> was<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.920> don't

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
SAT there and the whoever was I don't

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.230 
SAT there and the whoever was I don't
even<00:01:11.100> know<00:01:11.250> who<00:01:11.400> was<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:11.939> signed<00:01:12.150> the

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
even know who was that signed the

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.030 
even know who was that signed the
paperwork<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.810> wasn't<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.140> judge<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.740> didn't

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
paperwork it wasn't the judge I didn't

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.109 
paperwork it wasn't the judge I didn't
even<00:01:14.100> have<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.340> go<00:01:14.490> in<00:01:14.580> front<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.909> judge

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
even have to go in front of the judge

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.940 
even have to go in front of the judge
think<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.450> was<00:01:15.600> very<00:01:15.780> abrupt<00:01:16.110> but<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.560> think<00:01:16.830> he's

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
think I was very abrupt but I think he's

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.429 
think I was very abrupt but I think he's
some<00:01:17.130> defender<00:01:17.759> or<00:01:18.210> some<00:01:18.450> nut<00:01:18.810> defender<00:01:19.259> but

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
some defender or some nut defender but

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.320 
some defender or some nut defender but
he's<00:01:20.369> probably<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.850> state<00:01:21.570> prosecutor<00:01:22.259> and

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
he's probably the state prosecutor and

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.940 
he's probably the state prosecutor and
he<00:01:24.330> filled<00:01:24.689> out<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.930> form<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.350> i<00:01:25.409> had<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.680> pay

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.170 
realized that our system while it's not
perfect<00:02:32.349> it's<00:02:32.709> so<00:02:33.459> much<00:02:33.610> better<00:02:33.760> than<00:02:33.879> any

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
perfect it's so much better than any

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.569 
perfect it's so much better than any
other<00:02:34.420> system<00:02:34.720> I<00:02:35.140> mean<00:02:35.409> what<00:02:36.069> I'm<00:02:36.250> grateful

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
other system I mean what I'm grateful

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:39.569 
other system I mean what I'm grateful
for<00:02:36.819> is<00:02:37.359> that<00:02:37.629> if<00:02:38.170> I<00:02:38.470> were<00:02:38.650> in<00:02:38.859> pretty<00:02:39.189> much<00:02:39.310> any

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579 
for is that if I were in pretty much any

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:42.030 
for is that if I were in pretty much any
other<00:02:39.790> country<00:02:40.390> I<00:02:40.659> would<00:02:41.440> have<00:02:41.590> just<00:02:41.890> been

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
other country I would have just been

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.759 
other country I would have just been
given<00:02:42.609> the<00:02:42.940> hand<00:02:43.450> that<00:02:43.629> I<00:02:43.690> was<00:02:43.900> given<00:02:44.140> and<00:02:44.680> I

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
given the hand that I was given and I

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.319 
given the hand that I was given and I
wouldn't<00:02:45.099> have<00:02:45.190> had<00:02:45.340> the<00:02:45.489> option<00:02:45.640> to<00:02:45.909> go<00:02:46.150> back

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
wouldn't have had the option to go back

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:48.449 
wouldn't have had the option to go back
in<00:02:46.659> and<00:02:46.870> tell<00:02:47.109> him<00:02:47.290> that<00:02:47.470> he<00:02:47.620> was<00:02:47.769> wrong<00:02:48.010> and

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
in and tell him that he was wrong and

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.670 
in and tell him that he was wrong and
that<00:02:48.519> he<00:02:48.940> needed<00:02:48.970> to<00:02:49.239> fix<00:02:49.569> the<00:02:49.780> paperwork<00:02:49.989> and

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
that he needed to fix the paperwork and

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.550 
that he needed to fix the paperwork and
that<00:02:51.430> he<00:02:51.579> would<00:02:51.730> have<00:02:51.849> actually<00:02:52.349> agreed<00:02:53.349> to

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
that he would have actually agreed to

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.920 
that he would have actually agreed to
that<00:02:53.709> I<00:02:54.069> think<00:02:54.639> that's<00:02:54.849> the<00:02:55.060> one<00:02:55.239> thing<00:02:55.540> is

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
that I think that's the one thing is

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.670 
that I think that's the one thing is
that<00:02:56.200> there<00:02:56.379> is<00:02:56.620> an<00:02:56.980> ounce<00:02:57.250> left<00:02:57.790> of<00:02:58.680> common

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
that there is an ounce left of common

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.020 
that there is an ounce left of common
sense<00:02:59.950> in<00:03:00.340> our<00:03:00.489> system<00:03:00.940> and<00:03:01.620> it's<00:03:02.620> not<00:03:02.859> I<00:03:03.340> mean

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
sense in our system and it's not I mean

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.770 
sense in our system and it's not I mean
you<00:03:04.690> know<00:03:05.400> it's<00:03:06.400> debatable<00:03:07.090> i<00:03:07.150> try<00:03:07.359> to<00:03:07.420> find

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
you know it's debatable i try to find

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.869 
you know it's debatable i try to find
the<00:03:07.930> bright<00:03:08.109> side<00:03:08.379> and<00:03:09.040> I<00:03:09.129> think<00:03:09.370> you<00:03:09.849> know

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
the bright side and I think you know

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.990 
the bright side and I think you know
I've<00:03:10.060> learned<00:03:10.269> a<00:03:10.359> lot<00:03:10.540> in<00:03:10.810> this<00:03:11.019> process<00:03:11.349> and

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
I've learned a lot in this process and

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.860 
I've learned a lot in this process and
really<00:03:13.000> is<00:03:13.150> how<00:03:13.269> important<00:03:13.690> it<00:03:13.750> is<00:03:13.870> for<00:03:13.930> me<00:03:14.379> to

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
really is how important it is for me to

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.240 
really is how important it is for me to
stand<00:03:16.870> at<00:03:16.989> the<00:03:17.079> radar

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
stand at the radar

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.610 
stand at the radar
and<00:03:19.420> what<00:03:20.420> I<00:03:20.450> need<00:03:20.720> to<00:03:20.750> do<00:03:20.960> in<00:03:21.170> the<00:03:21.260> future<00:03:21.410> to

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
and what I need to do in the future to

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.650 
and what I need to do in the future to
avoid<00:03:22.010> this<00:03:22.340> type<00:03:22.400> of<00:03:22.610> situation<00:03:22.880> but<00:03:23.600> I

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
avoid this type of situation but I

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:24.910 
avoid this type of situation but I
really<00:03:24.080> don't<00:03:24.230> think<00:03:24.320> this<00:03:24.530> is<00:03:24.710> something

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
really don't think this is something

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.420 
really don't think this is something
