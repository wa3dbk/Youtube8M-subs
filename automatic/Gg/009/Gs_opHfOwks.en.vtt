peeled potatoes can just pressure cook
them<00:00:29.910> grating<00:00:30.840> will<00:00:31.019> ensure<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:31.500> there<00:00:31.890> are

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
them grating will ensure that there are

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
have to divide the mixture into small

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.120 
have to divide the mixture into small
portions<00:01:34.610> and<00:01:35.120> just<00:01:35.990> roll<00:01:36.470> the<00:01:36.620> tikki<00:01:36.950> on<00:01:37.040> the

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
portions and just roll the tikki on the

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.710 
portions and just roll the tikki on the
chopping<00:01:37.490> board<00:01:37.670> so<00:01:37.880> that<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:38.180> edges<00:01:38.600> are

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
chopping board so that the edges are

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.320 
chopping board so that the edges are
even<00:01:39.110> you<00:01:39.590> can<00:01:39.770> put<00:01:40.070> one<00:01:40.340> tikki<00:01:40.700> in<00:01:40.850> oil<00:01:41.090> and

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
even you can put one tikki in oil and

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.470 
even you can put one tikki in oil and
see<00:01:41.720> if<00:01:41.930> it<00:01:42.080> is<00:01:42.200> disintegrating

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:43.480 
see if it is disintegrating

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.330 
see if it is disintegrating
if<00:01:44.480> the<00:01:44.900> aloo<00:01:45.200> tikki<00:01:45.530> is<00:01:45.590> this<00:01:45.770> integrating

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
if the aloo tikki is this integrating

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.740 
if the aloo tikki is this integrating
that<00:01:46.550> means<00:01:46.820> you'll<00:01:47.030> have<00:01:47.090> to<00:01:47.210> put<00:01:47.510> little

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
that means you'll have to put little

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.020
