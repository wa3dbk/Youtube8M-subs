do<00:00:35.400> with<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.580> battery<00:00:35.850> turns<00:00:36.090> out<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:38.059> and<00:00:39.059> it

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
do with the battery turns out so and it

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:40.640 
do with the battery turns out so and it
just<00:00:39.809> got<00:00:39.900> to<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.050> point<00:00:40.230> where<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.470> wasn't

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:40.650 
just got to a point where I wasn't

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.979 
just got to a point where I wasn't
starting<00:00:41.100> period<00:00:41.430> anymore

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
starting period anymore

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.720 
starting period anymore
and<00:00:43.320> got<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.070> point<00:00:44.250> where<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.460> actually

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
and got to a point where I actually

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.719 
and got to a point where I actually
thought<00:00:45.150> I've<00:00:45.800> overheated<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.980> starter<00:00:47.460> but

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:47.729 
thought I've overheated the starter but

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:50.869 
thought I've overheated the starter but
anyway<00:00:48.830> far<00:00:49.830> as<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.010> know<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.159> didn't<00:00:50.489> overheat

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
anyway far as I know I didn't overheat

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.560 
anyway far as I know I didn't overheat
the<00:00:51.030> starter<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:51.570> that's<00:00:51.750> good<00:00:52.159> putting<00:00:53.159> away

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
the starter so that's good putting away

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.910 
the starter so that's good putting away
this<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.750> probably<00:00:55.080> being<00:00:55.229> my<00:00:55.409> project<00:00:55.799> for

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
this is probably being my project for

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.579 
this is probably being my project for

lost for a while I've been working on it
I<00:00:58.710> built<00:00:59.239> just<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.420> little<00:01:00.960> pair<00:01:01.140> ramps<00:01:03.350> and

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
like a car left right motor would stuff

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.070 
like a car left right motor would stuff
and<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.340> couple<00:01:08.700> old<00:01:08.850> concrete<00:01:09.540> forms<00:01:09.960> I

off<00:03:57.139> the<00:03:58.139> only<00:03:58.380> pride<00:03:58.560> I<00:03:58.590> had<00:03:58.799> a<00:03:58.829> problem<00:03:59.130> a

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
off the only pride I had a problem a

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.500 
off the only pride I had a problem a
hard<00:04:00.209> time<00:04:00.720> getting<00:04:01.319> back<00:04:01.470> together<00:04:01.620> was<00:04:01.980> a

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
hard time getting back together was a

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.819 
hard time getting back together was a
ending<00:04:03.510> the<00:04:03.599> piston<00:04:04.019> bolted<00:04:04.379> back<00:04:04.500> to<00:04:04.709> the

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
ending the piston bolted back to the

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.520 
ending the piston bolted back to the
camshaft<00:04:05.639> which<00:04:05.879> is<00:04:06.030> a<00:04:06.120> pain<00:04:06.419> he<00:04:06.629> asked<00:04:06.750> but

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
camshaft which is a pain he asked but

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.589 
camshaft which is a pain he asked but
anyway<00:04:10.400> pulled<00:04:11.400> the<00:04:11.519> entire<00:04:11.730> head<00:04:12.150> off<00:04:12.269> first

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
anyway pulled the entire head off first

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:15.559 
anyway pulled the entire head off first
and<00:04:13.250> great<00:04:14.250> then<00:04:14.549> there<00:04:14.849> I<00:04:14.879> figured<00:04:15.239> out<00:04:15.329> what

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
and great then there I figured out what

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.830 
and great then there I figured out what
the<00:04:15.599> problem<00:04:15.720> was<00:04:16.109> a<00:04:16.910> piston<00:04:17.910> just<00:04:18.359> over<00:04:18.630> time

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
the problem was a piston just over time

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.890 
the problem was a piston just over time
built<00:04:19.349> up<00:04:19.560> with<00:04:19.739> dirt<00:04:20.180> well<00:04:21.180> the<00:04:21.299> fine

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
built up with dirt well the fine

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.689 
built up with dirt well the fine
particles<00:04:22.800> of<00:04:22.919> dust<00:04:23.070> I<00:04:23.250> tore<00:04:23.430> out<00:04:23.460> in<00:04:23.639> the

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 
particles of dust I tore out in the

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:27.409 
particles of dust I tore out in the
field<00:04:24.320> down<00:04:25.340> mixed<00:04:26.340> with<00:04:26.460> gosh<00:04:26.700> just<00:04:27.120> caked

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
field down mixed with gosh just caked

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:27.920 
field down mixed with gosh just caked
and

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
and

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.110 
and
baked<00:04:28.139> in<00:04:28.410> there<00:04:28.800> there<00:04:28.949> was<00:04:29.039> a<00:04:29.070> quarter<00:04:29.910> of<00:04:30.030> an

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
baked in there there was a quarter of an

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.990 
baked in there there was a quarter of an
inch<00:04:30.210> of<00:04:30.600> crap<00:04:31.070> baked<00:04:32.070> in<00:04:32.310> there<00:04:32.669> it<00:04:32.789> was

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
inch of crap baked in there it was

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.879 
inch of crap baked in there it was
insane

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
insane

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.490 
insane
I<00:04:35.570> actually<00:04:36.570> thought<00:04:36.900> there<00:04:37.110> might<00:04:37.320> have<00:04:37.350> been

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
I actually thought there might have been

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.400 
I actually thought there might have been
some<00:04:37.919> scoring<00:04:38.280> in<00:04:38.490> the<00:04:38.580> piston<00:04:39.020> but<00:04:40.020> actually

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
some scoring in the piston but actually

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.790 
some scoring in the piston but actually
no<00:04:40.530> it's<00:04:40.740> like<00:04:40.860> brand-new<00:04:41.580> piston<00:04:42.300> sleeves<00:04:42.570> is

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
no it's like brand-new piston sleeves is

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.270 
no it's like brand-new piston sleeves is
brand-new<00:04:43.800> everything's<00:04:44.490> perfect<00:04:46.070> so<00:04:47.070> and

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
brand-new everything's perfect so and

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.189 
brand-new everything's perfect so and
then<00:04:47.400> I<00:04:47.430> just<00:04:47.759> decided<00:04:48.120> to<00:04:48.539> pull<00:04:48.780> this<00:04:48.900> entire

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 
then I just decided to pull this entire

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:51.740 
then I just decided to pull this entire
cover<00:04:49.770> off<00:04:49.949> anyway<00:04:50.340> so<00:04:50.400> I<00:04:50.820> pulled<00:04:51.150> that<00:04:51.300> off

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
cover off anyway so I pulled that off

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.950 
cover off anyway so I pulled that off
and<00:04:51.960> there's<00:04:52.169> the<00:04:52.380> fan<00:04:52.770> in<00:04:52.949> the<00:04:53.750> shoot<00:04:54.750> once

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
and there's the fan in the shoot once

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.830 
and there's the fan in the shoot once
again<00:04:55.169> I<00:04:55.289> forgot<00:04:55.410> the<00:04:55.620> name<00:04:58.370> shoot<00:04:59.690> the<00:05:00.690> thing

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
again I forgot the name shoot the thing

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.230 
again I forgot the name shoot the thing
to<00:05:01.110> create<00:05:02.009> this<00:05:02.250> fart<00:05:02.490> for<00:05:02.669> the<00:05:02.789> spark<00:05:03.030> plug

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
to create this fart for the spark plug

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.610 
to create this fart for the spark plug
if<00:05:03.360> you<00:05:03.449> guys<00:05:03.539> know<00:05:03.780> the<00:05:03.930> name<00:05:04.110> of<00:05:04.229> it<00:05:04.380> let<00:05:04.590> me

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
if you guys know the name of it let me

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.589 
if you guys know the name of it let me
know<00:05:04.710> keep<00:05:05.580> free<00:05:05.759> I<00:05:05.910> always<00:05:06.330> end<00:05:06.509> up

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:06.599 
know keep free I always end up

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:08.300 
know keep free I always end up
forgetting<00:05:06.780> what<00:05:07.199> it's<00:05:07.410> called<00:05:07.620> but<00:05:08.070> anyway

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
forgetting what it's called but anyway

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.210 
forgetting what it's called but anyway
um<00:05:08.660> pulled<00:05:09.660> that<00:05:09.780> up<00:05:09.960> and<00:05:10.650> also<00:05:10.830> that<00:05:11.099> was

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
um pulled that up and also that was

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.279 
um pulled that up and also that was
caked<00:05:11.460> with<00:05:11.550> dust<00:05:11.789> so<00:05:12.360> I'm<00:05:12.630> assuming<00:05:13.050> that's

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:13.289 
caked with dust so I'm assuming that's

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:16.400 
caked with dust so I'm assuming that's
probably<00:05:13.699> why<00:05:14.699> there<00:05:15.030> was<00:05:15.150> not<00:05:15.570> much<00:05:15.750> of<00:05:15.810> spark

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
probably why there was not much of spark

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.580 
probably why there was not much of spark
so<00:05:16.680> anyway<00:05:17.389> got<00:05:18.389> it<00:05:18.479> all<00:05:18.570> put<00:05:18.780> back<00:05:18.810> together<00:05:19.050> I

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.680 
so anyway got it all put back together I
just<00:05:19.710> have<00:05:19.979> to<00:05:20.160> put<00:05:20.759> a<00:05:20.789> few<00:05:21.000> more<00:05:21.030> things<00:05:21.389> back

barring<00:05:24.690> cover<00:05:25.009> batteries<00:05:26.009> charging<00:05:26.430> right

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729 
barring cover batteries charging right

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:29.450 
barring cover batteries charging right
now<00:05:27.229> giving<00:05:28.229> and<00:05:28.530> then<00:05:28.650> I'm<00:05:28.800> gonna<00:05:28.979> probably

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.640 
now giving and then I'm gonna probably
replace<00:05:29.759> the<00:05:30.030> front<00:05:30.240> of<00:05:30.419> the<00:05:30.509> brake<00:05:30.930> shoes<00:05:31.229> -

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650

brake<00:05:32.610> pads<00:05:32.880> and<00:05:33.060> everything<00:05:33.650> then<00:05:34.650> I'll<00:05:34.770> hose

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
brake pads and everything then I'll hose

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.879 
brake pads and everything then I'll hose
her<00:05:35.220> down<00:05:35.250> and<00:05:35.669> she<00:05:36.539> can<00:05:36.810> get<00:05:37.229> her<00:05:37.349> going<00:05:37.560> again
