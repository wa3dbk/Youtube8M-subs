00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.100
 hello everyone welcome to a week 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.590
 more on this occasion we bring you the 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.810
 unboxing of the latest apple model 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.320
 the imac in particular the model of 27 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:44.540
 inch just open the box we're going 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.640
 to start with the odyssey of power 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.600
 remove it from the protective box of 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.600
 next cardboard 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.660
 on the side of the box we can 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.080
 find the description of the monitor on 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.020
 incorporating processor and the new logo 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.500
 of the thunderbolt system of intel and 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.500
 Manzana 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.750
 inside the box we find the same as 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:22.580
 in previous models a first section 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:26.210
 in a box where inside we will have the 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.430
 mouse keyboard and documentation in this 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.000
 case is a wireless keyboard by 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.000
 wireless 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.110
 then I asked for it with the magic trackpad to 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.590
 can prove it 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:45.230
 what thing that did not displease me and then 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.500
 the typical documentation with the 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:52.700
 apple stickers and user manual and 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:56.140
 guarantee both of the mouse equipment and 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.140
 keyboard of the sea 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.860
 and then once the 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.080
 lateral protectors we will have the 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.509
 equipment where you have to tie it well and 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.929
 give him a little courage to lift 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:12.090
 the practically 15 or few more kilos 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.030
 that weighs the equipment 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.129
 comes wrapped by the white fabric to 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.010
 protect the computer both the screen 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:22.500
 as its metal parts simply 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.260
 we will introduce you and we will pull the canvas 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.940
 gently upwards removing the 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.540
 laterals that they had in trend 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.540
 engage 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.830
 being the 17- inch team 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.340
 it comes with the following connections 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:45.200
 Auxiliary input 4 output 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:48.380
 usb ports 2.0 an 802 firewall 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.650
 thunderball connections and a port of 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.650
 net 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.230
 once the white castite has been removed 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.240
 protective and the only thing that we have to 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.880
 do is remove the plastic protector 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.830
 so that comes protecting the crystal 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.810
 you have to do some strength and it seems 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.180
 that you are going to take the screen behind 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.120
 but do not panic by pulling little by little 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.250
 we can get it right in another model of 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.070
 imac that I had before as you know if it is 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.560
 read on an SSD disk replace the disk 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.960
 original hard that came for a or ssd in 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.820
 this time I have not been able to do it yet 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.490
 that new equipment no longer carries the 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.860
 thermal probe that we could replace it and 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.320
 put one of a super drive but that 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.580
 now read the temperature directly 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.890
 of firmware or sensors 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.530
 interiors that it carries then it is not so 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:38.070
 easy to replace one hard drive with another or 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:41.190
 Yes, there is the option of placing him 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:44.400
 a second hard drive but the task 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.230
 assembly is quite complicated and 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.390
 for the test time I had with 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.610
 the team was not worth me maybe 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.220
 later or in the new imac that 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.860
 are about to come out explain how to install 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.270
 well summarizing a bit the imac is a 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.700
 great team of 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.280
 I have been able to try both the macbook that the 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.650
 macbook pro of 15 and the clear imac is 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.600
 I stay with him and more and that will depend on 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.810
 our work or for what we go 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:12.810
 to use but it's a great team and 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.610
 some great features because today 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.830
 for today you can put a second 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.530
 SSD unit and we would take a 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:21.480
 barbarian performance as well as much more 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.330
 silent operation of the equipment 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.760
 but that will already depend on each of the 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.130
 needs you have when you can 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.950
 choose one team or another but for me 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.170
 opinion the winner of the three in this 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.510
 case by the screen size paper and 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:39.630
 benefits in this case is the hima 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.850
 well this would be all thanks a lot 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.100
 everyone and please remember so much about 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:47.040
 Vote how to subscribe to be able to follow 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.370
 making the videos a greeting and up 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.370
 the next 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.710
 Y 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:58.710
 yes
