but i'm not sure if you guys wanted to
see<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.759> first<00:02:06.390> part<00:02:06.720> so<00:02:07.080> i'm<00:02:08.069> gonna<00:02:08.250> go

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
see that first part so i'm gonna go

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.889 
see that first part so i'm gonna go
ahead<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.759> try<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.209> get<00:02:09.360> this<00:02:09.509> in<00:02:09.630> a<00:02:09.660> different

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
ahead and try to get this in a different

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.860 
ahead and try to get this in a different
angle<00:02:10.619> probably<00:02:11.310> i'm<00:02:11.610> not<00:02:12.060> sure<00:02:12.239> i<00:02:12.540> guess<00:02:12.750> this

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
angle probably i'm not sure i guess this

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.260 
angle probably i'm not sure i guess this
is<00:02:13.020> a<00:02:13.050> decent<00:02:13.380> a<00:02:13.590> good<00:02:13.800> decent<00:02:14.190> enough<00:02:14.790> angle

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
blasting in the box i believe is the USB

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.699 
blasting in the box i believe is the USB
charger<00:03:42.310> so<00:03:43.090> this<00:03:43.569> thing<00:03:43.750> looks<00:03:43.959> pretty<00:03:44.170> sick

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
charger so this thing looks pretty sick

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.890 
charger so this thing looks pretty sick
too<00:03:44.980> and<00:03:45.010> I<00:03:45.489> already<00:03:45.970> liked<00:03:46.300> it<00:03:46.450> from<00:03:46.569> the<00:03:46.660> feel

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
too and I already liked it from the feel

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.320 
too and I already liked it from the feel
of<00:03:46.989> it<00:03:47.140> has<00:03:47.440> the<00:03:47.650> flat<00:03:47.950> cables<00:03:48.459> go<00:03:49.060> ahead<00:03:49.209> and

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
of it has the flat cables go ahead and

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.600 
of it has the flat cables go ahead and
try<00:03:49.390> and<00:03:49.480> get<00:03:49.690> this<00:03:49.870> focused<00:03:50.650> it<00:03:51.220> has<00:03:51.489> this

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
try and get this focused it has this

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.400 
try and get this focused it has this
little<00:03:51.670> flat<00:03:52.150> cable<00:03:52.600> and<00:03:52.720> if<00:03:52.810> we<00:03:52.930> look<00:03:53.170> right

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
little flat cable and if we look right

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.990 
little flat cable and if we look right
here<00:03:53.440> this<00:03:53.770> white<00:03:54.040> thing<00:03:54.069> is<00:03:54.459> basically<00:03:54.970> a

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
here this white thing is basically a

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.750 
here this white thing is basically a
cable<00:03:55.840> management<00:03:56.050> built<00:03:56.590> into<00:03:57.010> the<00:03:57.160> charger

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
cable management built into the charger

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.300 
cable management built into the charger
so<00:03:58.239> that's<00:03:58.420> pretty<00:03:58.600> cool<00:03:58.690> but<00:03:59.230> yeah<00:03:59.500> and<00:03:59.770> I

can<00:04:57.300> compare<00:04:58.300> this<00:04:58.479> to<00:04:58.720> the<00:04:58.750> feeling<00:04:59.380> of<00:04:59.470> the

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
can compare this to the feeling of the

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.440 
can compare this to the feeling of the
texture<00:05:00.010> on<00:05:00.130> the<00:05:00.160> sandstone<00:05:00.729> perversion<00:05:01.300> but

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
texture on the sandstone perversion but

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.750 
texture on the sandstone perversion but
yeah<00:05:01.539> this<00:05:01.660> feels<00:05:01.870> really<00:05:02.289> good<00:05:02.560> and<00:05:02.890> it's

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
yeah this feels really good and it's

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.610 
yeah this feels really good and it's
really<00:05:03.970> the<00:05:04.180> same<00:05:04.210> size<00:05:04.660> as<00:05:04.780> the<00:05:04.900> Oppo<00:05:05.200> find<00:05:05.410> 7

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
really the same size as the Oppo find 7

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.340 
really the same size as the Oppo find 7
so<00:05:06.010> I'm<00:05:06.130> already<00:05:06.520> okay<00:05:07.450> with<00:05:07.630> the<00:05:07.750> size<00:05:07.960> aren't

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
so I'm already okay with the size aren't

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.140 
so I'm already okay with the size aren't
really<00:05:08.560> like<00:05:08.590> this<00:05:09.010> size<00:05:09.220> and<00:05:09.250> I<00:05:09.490> prefer<00:05:09.940> this

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
really like this size and I prefer this

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.960 
really like this size and I prefer this
size<00:05:10.450> like<00:05:11.169> the<00:05:11.620> bezels<00:05:12.190> care<00:05:12.430> to<00:05:12.550> be<00:05:12.669> smaller

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
size like the bezels care to be smaller

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.540 
size like the bezels care to be smaller
but<00:05:13.180> i<00:05:13.240> prefer<00:05:13.600> the<00:05:13.630> 5.5<00:05:14.380> inch<00:05:14.650> screen<00:05:14.950> size<00:05:15.220> so

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
but i prefer the 5.5 inch screen size so

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.900 
but i prefer the 5.5 inch screen size so
with<00:05:16.270> this<00:05:16.419> size<00:05:16.660> if<00:05:16.930> it's<00:05:17.229> okay<00:05:17.590> with<00:05:17.740> me<00:05:17.880> so<00:05:18.880> i

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
with this size if it's okay with me so i

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.490 
with this size if it's okay with me so i
guess<00:05:19.270> we<00:05:19.419> can<00:05:19.539> go<00:05:19.690> ahead<00:05:19.780> and<00:05:19.900> take<00:05:20.200> that<00:05:20.229> off

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
guess we can go ahead and take that off

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.770 
guess we can go ahead and take that off
I<00:05:20.710> guess<00:05:20.919> the<00:05:21.070> battery<00:05:21.430> is<00:05:21.610> already<00:05:22.150> inside

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
I guess the battery is already inside

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.529 
I guess the battery is already inside

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 
or anything like that it just

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.600

automatically boot it until into the
home<00:06:35.910> screen<00:06:36.330> but<00:06:36.630> I<00:06:36.840> guess<00:06:37.560> we're<00:06:37.770> getting<00:06:38.040> a

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.130

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.400 
home screen but I guess we're getting a
little<00:06:38.389> view<00:06:39.389> of<00:06:39.540> what<00:06:39.720> we're<00:06:39.900> supposed<00:06:40.350> to

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:42.620 
see it in the device it's pretty snappy

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.629 
see it in the device it's pretty snappy

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 
seeing the little home screen leg that

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:48.680 
seeing the little home screen leg that
was<00:06:46.979> described<00:06:47.520> in<00:06:47.699> some<00:06:47.940> of<00:06:48.060> the<00:06:48.180> older

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:48.690 
was described in some of the older

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:50.840 
was described in some of the older
reviews<00:06:49.139> the<00:06:49.440> newer<00:06:49.770> reviews<00:06:49.979> that<00:06:50.430> came<00:06:50.639> out

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:50.850 
reviews the newer reviews that came out

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:53.689 
reviews the newer reviews that came out
at<00:06:51.330> first<00:06:51.960> because<00:06:52.260> those<00:06:52.830> were<00:06:53.160> the

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:53.699 
at first because those were the

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:56.390 
at first because those were the
pre-production<00:06:54.950> versions<00:06:55.950> and<00:06:56.040> this<00:06:56.220> is<00:06:56.370> of

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 
pre-production versions and this is of

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.879 
pre-production versions and this is of
retail<00:06:57.030> version<00:06:57.419> so<00:06:57.600> they<00:06:58.139> recently<00:06:58.560> did<00:06:58.740> an

00:06:58.879 --> 00:06:58.889 
retail version so they recently did an

00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:01.219 
retail version so they recently did an
update<00:06:59.100> to<00:06:59.550> where<00:06:59.820> all<00:07:00.419> the<00:07:00.630> things<00:07:00.900> are<00:07:01.050> gone

00:07:01.219 --> 00:07:01.229 
update to where all the things are gone

00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:03.110 
update to where all the things are gone
in<00:07:01.470> you<00:07:02.010> probably<00:07:02.280> can<00:07:02.460> see<00:07:02.610> a<00:07:02.639> little<00:07:02.850> bit<00:07:03.060> of

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120 
in you probably can see a little bit of

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.150 
in you probably can see a little bit of
lag<00:07:03.330> but<00:07:03.600> they<00:07:03.780> really<00:07:03.960> won't<00:07:04.200> bother<00:07:04.710> me<00:07:04.889> at

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.160 
lag but they really won't bother me at

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.250 
lag but they really won't bother me at
all<00:07:05.280> by<00:07:05.639> pressing<00:07:06.600> the<00:07:06.690> home<00:07:06.900> screen<00:07:07.229> I
