I'm going home today I'm going back to

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.660 
I'm going home today I'm going back to
the<00:00:06.990> Aquarius<00:00:07.620> habitat<00:00:07.799> where<00:00:08.280> I<00:00:08.309> lived

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
the Aquarius habitat where I lived

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.080 
the Aquarius habitat where I lived
underwater<00:00:09.389> for<00:00:09.960> two<00:00:10.349> weeks<00:00:10.620> as<00:00:11.610> part<00:00:11.969> of

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
underwater for two weeks as part of

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.360 
underwater for two weeks as part of
NASA's<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.570> Nemo<00:00:12.870> 5<00:00:13.170> mission<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:14.009> since<00:00:14.219> that

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
NASA's a Nemo 5 mission and since that

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.000 
NASA's a Nemo 5 mission and since that
time<00:00:14.429> I've<00:00:15.179> spent<00:00:15.500> 167<00:00:16.500> days

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010

International Space Station so you know
it's<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.660> huge<00:00:21.810> part<00:00:22.140> of<00:00:22.199> my<00:00:22.320> career<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:22.740> I'm

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
it's a huge part of my career and I'm

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.920 
it's a huge part of my career and I'm
very<00:00:22.920> excited<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.460> be<00:00:23.490> able<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.850> return<00:00:24.150> the

go live in a habitat underwater where

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.930 
go live in a habitat underwater where
they're<00:00:40.200> surrounded<00:00:40.800> by<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.950> very<00:00:41.160> extreme<00:00:41.700> and

they're surrounded by a very extreme and
dangerous<00:00:42.059> environment<00:00:42.899> is<00:00:43.050> very<00:00:43.140> very

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
dangerous environment is very very

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.940 
dangerous environment is very very
similar<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:44.040> what<00:00:44.309> we<00:00:44.610> do<00:00:44.820> in<00:00:45.090> outer<00:00:45.539> space

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
similar to what we do in outer space

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.130 
similar to what we do in outer space
when<00:00:46.950> we<00:00:46.980> go<00:00:47.219> outside<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:48.090> Aquarius<00:00:48.600> we<00:00:48.960> have

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
when we go outside of Aquarius we have

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.990 
when we go outside of Aquarius we have
to<00:00:49.320> Don<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.559> appropriate<00:00:50.219> equipment<00:00:50.670> we<00:00:50.820> have

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
to Don the appropriate equipment we have

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.250 
to Don the appropriate equipment we have
to<00:00:51.149> have<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.390> appropriate<00:00:51.660> amount<00:00:51.960> of

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
to have the appropriate amount of

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.560 
to have the appropriate amount of
training<00:00:52.500> we<00:00:53.129> have<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.489> be<00:00:53.610> ready<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:54.059> do<00:00:54.270> the

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
training we have to be ready to do the

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.900 
training we have to be ready to do the
work<00:00:54.809> outside<00:00:55.800> in<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.520> dangerous

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
work outside in the dangerous

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.520 
work outside in the dangerous
environment<00:00:57.420> just<00:00:57.629> like<00:00:57.750> we<00:00:57.960> do<00:00:58.109> when<00:00:58.350> we<00:00:58.500> put

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
environment just like we do when we put

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.160 
environment just like we do when we put
on<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.949> spacesuit<00:00:59.489> exit<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.420> airlock<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.050> do

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
on the spacesuit exit the airlock and do

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.770 
on the spacesuit exit the airlock and do
spacewalks<00:01:01.469> in<00:01:01.920> outer<00:01:02.070> space<00:01:02.570> you<00:01:03.570> know<00:01:03.660> when

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
spacewalks in outer space you know when

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.490 
spacewalks in outer space you know when
I<00:01:03.809> lived<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.260> Aquarius<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:05.220> was<00:01:05.400> my<00:01:05.549> first<00:01:05.760> true

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
I lived in Aquarius it was my first true

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.469 
I lived in Aquarius it was my first true
time<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.770> scuba<00:01:08.100> dive<00:01:08.130> on<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.490> regular<00:01:08.909> basis<00:01:09.299> to

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
time to scuba dive on a regular basis to

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.690 
time to scuba dive on a regular basis to
be<00:01:09.659> out<00:01:09.869> in<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.200> environment<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.100> see<00:01:11.460> the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
be out in that environment and see the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.969 
be out in that environment and see the
interaction<00:01:12.270> between<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:13.260> animals<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.920> the

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
interaction between the animals of the

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.730 
interaction between the animals of the
sea<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:15.060> sea<00:01:15.270> itself<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:16.020> coral<00:01:16.439> reefs

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
sea and the sea itself the coral reefs

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.100 
sea and the sea itself the coral reefs
and<00:01:17.040> those<00:01:17.880> are<00:01:18.060> very<00:01:18.210> important<00:01:18.689> things<00:01:18.900> and

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
and those are very important things and

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.990 
and those are very important things and
it<00:01:19.259> also<00:01:19.409> gives<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.009> same<00:01:20.340> perspective

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
it also gives you the same perspective

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.030 
it also gives you the same perspective
in<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.450> different<00:01:21.900> environment<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.860> get

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
in a different environment that you get

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.620 
in a different environment that you get
from<00:01:23.189> outer<00:01:23.369> space<00:01:23.729> when<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.030> see<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.360> planet

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
from outer space when you see the planet

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.810 
from outer space when you see the planet
from<00:01:24.900> above<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:26.130> understand<00:01:26.580> just<00:01:26.759> how

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
from above and you understand just how

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.060 
from above and you understand just how
fragile<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.990> how<00:01:28.380> thin<00:01:28.770> that

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
fragile it is and how thin that

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.190 
fragile it is and how thin that
atmosphere<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.240> wraps<00:01:30.509> our<00:01:30.720> planet<00:01:31.110> and

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
atmosphere is that wraps our planet and

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.350 
atmosphere is that wraps our planet and
keeps<00:01:31.380> us<00:01:31.560> safe<00:01:31.820> so<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:32.850> think<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.150> would<00:01:33.240> be

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
keeps us safe so I think it would be

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.270 
keeps us safe so I think it would be
very<00:01:33.659> cool<00:01:33.930> for<00:01:33.990> people<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.619> be<00:01:34.740> able<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.009> go

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
very cool for people to be able to go

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.969 
very cool for people to be able to go
underwater<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:36.060> live<00:01:36.780> or<00:01:37.110> stay<00:01:37.350> in<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.560> hotel

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
underwater and live or stay in a hotel

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.890 
underwater and live or stay in a hotel
for<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.670> short<00:01:38.970> period<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.329> time<00:01:39.390> just<00:01:39.780> like

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
for a short period of time just like

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.630 
for a short period of time just like
people<00:01:40.320> are<00:01:40.439> looking<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.829> go<00:01:40.950> into<00:01:40.979> space<00:01:41.400> for

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
people are looking to go into space for

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.670 
people are looking to go into space for
short<00:01:41.880> periods<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.270> time<00:01:42.329> we<00:01:42.990> need<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.290> expose

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
short periods of time we need to expose

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.490 
short periods of time we need to expose
more<00:01:43.979> humans<00:01:44.610> on<00:01:44.759> earth<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.630> inner<00:01:45.930> space<00:01:46.290> in

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
more humans on earth to inner space in

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.050 
more humans on earth to inner space in
outer<00:01:46.680> space<00:01:47.040> so<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.430> they<00:01:47.610> can<00:01:47.759> get<00:01:47.880> that

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
outer space so that they can get that
