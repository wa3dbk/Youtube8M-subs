00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.690
 to make the sauce you do not need 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:11.099
 who does the cream of milk to measure 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:14.660
 butter may be powdered or 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.890
 I fully admire 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:24.020
 Do not ask me the amount because I 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:24.020
 so do the sec a glass of water 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:42.210
 I'm a little bit it can rain the 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:43.500
 Peanut the former also does not prevent the 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:51.110
 How many of you are testing me? 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:51.110
 connect with a piece of butter 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.730
 except for a pinch of salt 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:06.010
 one more shot to make sure 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.590
 even making porridge as you already know how to make 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:15.340
 well not only to make porridge so I learned 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:19.030
 legal first phase is already almost 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.820
 the best consistency and can not 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:30.450
 in the video you could also do 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:30.450
 better after they already have this point 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.500
 it can be a 5 kg pack of 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.740
 Mix until dissolved and then 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.640
 It will take a while but I have a 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.740
 pause in the video caused after the cheese 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.540
 grated already dissolved 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.850
 Ok, you do not know what to talk about here. 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.750
 grated Parmesan 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:10.300
 ok do it is not to talk not talked O is not 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.760
 that man used this feature but here 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:19.690
 on the wall and grated parmesan 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:23.440
 there came the crime depending on the quantity 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:31.860
 that you make goes to the whole box like 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:34.000
 did not little vote dog died already 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.120
 mix the sour cream 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.420
 I do not need to boil leave, just warm up. 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.430
 been bubbling and that's where the 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.630
 ready as I will not even prove by 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.630
 what're you is delicious 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.530
 the chicken coffee is one of six in the pasta 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:57.400
 chicken 5 mil 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:02.310
 the amount needed before June 4 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.310
 of that year the flag 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:14.200
 there you publish in butter the new 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:18.910
 preferred site 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:21.150
 here when the butter and let the 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:26.340
 amount of you 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.340
 The time that you find here gets better. 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:42.700
 Then it's crazy for me to add 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:44.080
 the second is put the water arrived can 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:51.010
 be a fall that only had this 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:54.239
 medication and then the baby arrived for a 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.239
 goiano puddle 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.239
 that real lord 18 blinded me 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:14.790
 You have to vote and can now call 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:25.539
 190 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:29.979
 here we use an Italian beef 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:33.760
 in me the happy good 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:38.710
 but then you can use anyone who 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:43.660
 you want you think you do not too 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:46.479
 follow on to ok and any other mark 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:51.970
 that you want to be an eye too 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:58.600
 everything you can be finalizing now it's 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:05:00.340
 a little warm up on the chicken and a 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.100
 part of the chicken to make a single 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:10.270
 that I'm going to do the separate compositions 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:12.060
 then Moorish places a canon at 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:16.910
 quantity you too 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.910
 It's good to see how much it takes 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:32.090
 mix a little, I'm doing everything 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:32.090
 with the fire out so as not to burn the change 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.240
 remembering that the first position will 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:40.860
 to be better than the second 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.950
 because it will take all that part of the 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:46.130
 I saw the burnt pan of everything that 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:50.280
 faced the Flemish and the second must be 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:06:08.130
 now the rest of the tomato ingredients 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:06:10.610
 dry roll the one that the fabinho and time 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.610
 ready 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:16.430
 still thinking about stopping even said that 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.630
 it was grated of valada was the same 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:21.930
 these cheaper ingredients and I 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:23.220
 I came back to make up the second, it's good to 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:25.229
 my face 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:28.830
 so I put a dried tomato cheese 

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:31.550
 Provolone an organ only there are much more 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.550
 cheap and good 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 now you can follow flight tap vai 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:48.000
 warm up a little bit as you see the 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:52.010
 cheese start to melt 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.010
 It is that is already good and will mix 

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.850
 ready this is our final dish 

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:02.800
 I forgot to mention that you can 

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:05.410
 put a temper case here 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.330
 I added Calabrian pepper and a leaf 

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:09.070
 to decorate in the end how we 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.930
 is also missing a tattoo arm 

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:15.450
 car is onion chives 

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:15.450
 so this was not only at the end
