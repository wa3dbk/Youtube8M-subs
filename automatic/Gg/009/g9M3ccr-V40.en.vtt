I just want a nice flavoring of garlic
so<00:03:52.989> and<00:03:53.989> added<00:03:54.650> such<00:03:55.010> and<00:03:57.880> the<00:03:58.880> secret<00:03:59.360> of

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
so and added such and the secret of

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.990 
so and added such and the secret of
Indian<00:03:59.870> cooking<00:04:00.140> is<00:04:00.410> toasting<00:04:01.280> the<00:04:01.430> spices

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
Indian cooking is toasting the spices

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.320 
Indian cooking is toasting the spices
and<00:04:02.350> I<00:04:03.400> think<00:04:04.400> that<00:04:04.550> comes<00:04:04.820> only<00:04:05.060> with

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
and I think that comes only with

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.190 
and I think that comes only with
experience

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
experience

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.320 
experience
this<00:04:06.500> is<00:04:06.739> cumin<00:04:07.610> seeds<00:04:07.910> which<00:04:08.780> I've<00:04:08.959> added<00:04:10.330> and

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
this is cumin seeds which I've added and

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:18.909 
this is cumin seeds which I've added and
you<00:04:12.070> let<00:04:13.070> it<00:04:13.220> sizzle<00:04:13.790> and<00:04:14.269> Brown<00:04:15.549> and<00:04:17.919> then

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
you let it sizzle and Brown and then

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.390 
you let it sizzle and Brown and then
finally<00:04:19.549> I'm<00:04:19.820> going<00:04:20.720> to<00:04:20.870> take<00:04:21.100> the<00:04:22.100> red

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400
