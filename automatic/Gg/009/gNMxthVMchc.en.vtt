00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.650
 looking for the old room maybe it 's a 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:17.680
 important career that 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.349
 that very hard but at the same time a 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:24.009
 very interesting key because in addition to 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:26.439
 all the passages you can see are 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:29.320
 they are the cat that are the 160 that goes to 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:33.060
 increases with 4000 meters of altitude and 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:37.100
 with phenomenal passages all 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:40.180
 about the tropical deserts 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.610
 really awesome organizations 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:46.050
 it was perfect 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.860
 the supplies the dialing 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.440
 Accompaniment throughout the race 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.420
 it has been really that surprised me 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.269
 very much 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.960
 I hope next year to be able to go back and 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:02.480
 be able to defend the title what 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.480
 and with much in order I have achieved everything 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:14.750
 the organization of this race is 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:14.750
 delivered to two people who are 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.289
 everything has gone perfect I did not expect from 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.289
 true 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:31.140
 carlos me that I compete to say that 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:34.650
 is at the best level 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:39.000
 from safety the bearings the 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.680
 advertising that there is to the award 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.750
 it is one more attraction for all 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.470
 competitors what is what most 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.590
 scored on the course has been without a doubt 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:53.190
 the canyon that is a part of the development 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:56.250
 where obviously it was very hot and 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.010
 besides we should already like about 120 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.710
 kilometer 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:04.049
 and there it is in another side 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.570
 and the Mexican has been really hard 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.060
 but 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.670
 It has both hard and nice I know 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.980
 which says that in the background 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.340
 the memories of a career like this 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:19.100
 the truth is that all tours 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.640
 the whole race is precious remember 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:25.820
 also from the beginning that these effects very 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.100
 very hard hard that already takes me without 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:32.630
 have made the difference of the race 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:36.860
 because I knew for 10 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:40.100
 hard hard of 30% inclination and it is 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:43.640
 In the end such is hard but but it has been 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:47.600
 a key moment and it has been possible to do 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:51.220
 difference there I also remember a 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:54.820
 5-3 spectacular though 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:58.210
 pretty stony very trans style 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:02.200
 song with 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:06.190
 with an impressive stuck but one 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:09.250
 only possible line to transpose him and me 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.470
 I'm left with good good images of that 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.450
 of being moments the best room on 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.580
 fourth press 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.819
 the center also word the death of 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:21.180
 your level is ours 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:23.549
 another moment that reminds me of this 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:27.180
 career has been the time when a 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:30.659
 dog the famous chingo 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.150
 which is known as always going out to 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:37.109
 run after the cyclists I have not 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.849
 been exception and yes that luck that I have 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:41.760
 had that there were more people in the 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.650
 organization and has already been able to 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.780
 pass the dog to me because I think that 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.430
 I have that I wanted to see all I've 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.790
 run with me behind 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.379
 and I very much hope that next year will come 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.739
 in a hurry because I really want to 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:55.739
 return
