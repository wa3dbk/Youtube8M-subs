00:00:00.519 --> 00:00:03.540
 hello jean-françois fiorina i am the director of essec 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.540
 the year 2007 to end yesterday and with it 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.920
 the two rankings that are one of the important elements of life 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.330
 of a school we are indeed in an ultra competitive world is one of 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:15.649
 means why 

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:18.699
 our candidates have students to choose us so that's all 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:21.859
 just look elsewhere for the rankings and then the accreditations 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:25.789
 and then to tell yourself that depending on this 6th school maybe two of 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:26.789
 quality 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.320
 as far as we are concerned for us and it's true in all these rankings 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.960
 2007 regardless of ranking whether it's on the student's ranking the 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.820
 figaro mouloud lately shift 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.900
 we are ranked sixth 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.500
 she realizes that starting this ranking is stable since 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.740
 many years 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.460
 and especially for us it is the pledge of satisfaction since one realizes 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.270
 whatever the ranking angles w whatever the angles 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.760
 analyze so we are always points to the same place 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.140
 if I do a little summary of all these rankings we will say 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.190
 among the strong points retained at the level of two adorable for the figure the 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.190
 international relations with the large number of partners abroad 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.130
 the number of relations with companies and especially not how 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.550
 the quality of two years of these relationships and then disguises how the 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.180
 quality of our more in charge since the how 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.720
 our professors published in journals that are extremely well placed in 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.560
 in the back 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.290
 in the echoes at the international level here begins view are as well of the 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.690
 French magazines but also international 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.580
 this ranking we take them as a sign of encouragement they are for 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.150
 we a photograph at a given moment of our situation they we 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.820
 allow to see that the strategy that has been chosen or the voices that have 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.470
 been chosen or how 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.690
 these are are good he gives us a little bit how the idea of ​​style this 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.420
 that we must do as we position ourselves in relation to others 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.870
 but they are not a case an end in itself emilie all over again 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.250
 future candidate they can also join the prozac riding 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.310
 if we analyze the institutions a little bit 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.400
 number of quality goal standards
