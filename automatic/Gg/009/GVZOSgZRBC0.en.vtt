00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
the same exact thing that she was doing

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.170 
the same exact thing that she was doing
she<00:03:28.690> said<00:03:29.470> that<00:03:29.829> you<00:03:30.130> know<00:03:30.250> justify<00:03:30.850> it<00:03:30.910> with

the<00:03:31.299> mascara<00:03:31.720> brush<00:03:32.609> and<00:03:33.609> it<00:03:34.359> should<00:03:34.720> fix<00:03:35.109> that

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
the mascara brush and it should fix that

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.289 
the mascara brush and it should fix that
over<00:03:35.920> bleach<00:03:36.209> area<00:03:37.230> so<00:03:38.230> I<00:03:38.680> basically<00:03:39.519> applied

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
over bleach area so I basically applied

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.650

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
and I was just doing light strokes so I

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.140
