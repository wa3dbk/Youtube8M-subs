00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:11.050
 [Music] 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.850
 very good people here you have a video 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.740
 it included showing how to get bonne 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.180
 hilda before round 8 which is when 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.279
 comes the first panceri usually 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.900
 Complicating the games a lot is 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:22.210
 say that he already gets it in round 5 and 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.009
 I think it 's very very soon it's worth it 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.869
 pretty hard to get but good 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.640
 if you follow more or less the advice that 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.739
 I'm going to give you in this video I think that 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.660
 you can get it and you will not have 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:33.100
 problems in the worst case that 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.170
 we get the modifications as everything 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.090
 here not that in round six or seven 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.800
 sure you have it worth it is simply 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.750
 have a little patience and now you 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.969
 I'm going explains good mind basically 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.649
 I also I'm going to show that no 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:47.260
 basically I'm going to show you why 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:48.460
 you asked me to jce a lot when I was 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.890
 making the panzer videos to 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.359
 first you said you like me as 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.530
 let's get hilda before 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:55.329
 you got us the money and such 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.010
 well now I'm going to tell you my 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.289
 tricks to see first of all the 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.989
 first round never never shoot mouse 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:03.699
 ok I keep the bullets for the round 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.920
 two or three depending on whether I'm going to catch 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.060
 the by two not here I had to 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.280
 use a little but as a rule 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.310
 does not use it in round 2 and the 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.870
 explanation is that in origin to half of 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.620
 round 2 more or less could kill two 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.420
 or three zombies or four 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.190
 in a bonus in this case I 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.320
 they gave blood of bull also wanted that 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.820
 I saw it that way so you can see that I do not 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.680
 has given any other for two or none 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.990
 skull that is very would be easier for 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.270
 earn money and such with a blood of 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.160
 zombie that as a rule you are not going to 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.270
 get more points that's why it's worth it 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.470
 how good and what do you have? 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.090
 bonus and then already yes that 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.710
 we take the port to in round 3 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.240
 because they already come as about 13 or 14 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.490
 zombies I believe in this in our round 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.330
 then yes it is interesting to take 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:47.120
 the m-14 give two shots and slashes and 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.740
 that way we're going to cover the three 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.990
 first the first three rounds the 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.640
 we will move from here in the first room and 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.100
 in this way I think we will get 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.960
 a lot of pasta is worth then once 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.550
 we come to round 4 with a lot of eye 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.750
 that the giant does not take you away 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.330
 zombies is worth it because if we were not 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.740
 going through the area where you are going to step 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.900
 we would take away a lot of zombies and 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.880
 it would cost us much more to get the bong 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.230
 and the sooner as well once 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.780
 we have to have a little bit of a 

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:13.670
 little patience and as you see 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.160
 accumulate them all is worth I took a 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.690
 little nun from the ground and that's why I took 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.819
 butt ammo so you do not know if 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.249
 you have the bonne gilda 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.780
 If so, you have a ball and collect 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:26.030
 another one of the ground the ammunition is recharged 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.099
 as if there was a maximum ammunition but 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.650
 only in that weapon is it worth as well as 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.629
 you see is to group them all and always 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.249
 try to try to have it more in a row 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:36.109
 Notice how possible it will put 

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:37.730
 some way in which the slow ones that 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:41.269
 there are here all those who bring and I go to 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.980
 give each shot of these will be like 120 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:46.400
 points something like that, I was not either 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.049
 looking but let's go at least 70-80 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.079
 so fix now and as I'm lining 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:53.090
 and we always spend a yield before and 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:55.280
 then the time is running out 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.629
 or whatever it is with the m-14 I do not 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.189
 I recommend with screaming because if not yes 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:00.949
 you notice I would have eaten the month 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:03.889
 and what you just saw and well that spends 

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:06.019
 a whole hilda lining and once 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:07.459
 we have, I think it's about 11,000 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.599
 points or something like that we will have for 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.920
 open the whole map that we will do 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:13.250
 lack 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.959
 and you see how I'm taking advantage 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.280
 to the maximum besides then they will see me to muÃ±oz 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.020
 since I was quite lucky with the subject 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.090
 of 20 mbps and I say it so that you 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.380
 if we do not think then leaves to do 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.940
 clear what chance you can 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.980
 we not doing the same thing well 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.420
 It depends a lot on the items but I 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.150
 I say that before round 8 you go to 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.640
 be able to have insurance for the issue of 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.739
 people that cost more that more 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.519
 It costs to face the panzer and all that 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.750
 you see me there they gave me another ammo and 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.480
 that would be basically what it does in the 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.370
 round 4 of round 5 is the same goes for 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.010
 try to have mouse ammunition to 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.780
 to be able to group all and cover 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.370
 because it's that you line up and we can 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.840
 buy tiran is worth what I said is that 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.280
 they really are and you are much more 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.900
 quiet is not pending that do not 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.239
 give a double foolish blow 20 throw and 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.500
 you have to start over and there you are 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.239
 seeing worth just now is 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.190
 group them again and the same as before 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:04.190
 in the moment I tell you the moment we 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.050
 we are without mouse we will shoot with the 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.970
 emmy 14 the head 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.040
 or we can stab with the risk that 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.390
 It takes us to give us one more rope and 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.190
 that your decision will dream and 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.590
 play it Luciano to win some 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.140
 little dots more but if it is given I will never 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.790
 shit 'aces' worth or shot in the head 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.110
 and so apart from the policies that 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.240
 they needed giving they were giving 100 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:25.700
 dots for zombie so this one is 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.680
 pretty well it's also worth a good 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.300
 Once we have all that, we 're going to 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.790
 activate all the generators that 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.670
 we practically opened the map and 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.140
 we will have for better the woman I hope that 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.460
 everything has been clear any doubt 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:40.370
 You already know that you put me the comments 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:43.490
 and I am the only fixed solution or such 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.230
 and how do I have them all and that is to make sure that 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.780
 is that you line up the money in the 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.880
 variety of options round 5 had 11 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.410
 a thousand points I think so you know 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.790
 Any doubt you put it out there and 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.510
 nothing more kids a greeting and I hope that 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.510
 you like ciao 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:01.249
 rip open this is another of your machine 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.249
 alemany was right
