you<00:02:02.509> stand<00:02:02.570> back<00:02:02.869> just<00:02:03.050> a<00:02:03.200> little<00:02:03.229> bit<00:02:03.560> just<00:02:03.740> to

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
you stand back just a little bit just to

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.100 
you stand back just a little bit just to
be<00:02:03.979> absolutely<00:02:04.100> safe<00:02:04.610> sure<00:02:04.910> all<00:02:05.540> right<00:02:05.600> ready

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
be absolutely safe sure all right ready

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.740 
be absolutely safe sure all right ready
yeah<00:02:06.380> it's<00:02:07.310> definitely<00:02:07.790> something<00:02:08.060> where<00:02:08.390> it

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
yeah it's definitely something where it

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.389 
yeah it's definitely something where it
definitely<00:02:09.170> causes<00:02:09.380> a<00:02:09.530> moment<00:02:09.979> where<00:02:10.070> I<00:02:10.100> can't

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
definitely causes a moment where I can't

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:11.680 
definitely causes a moment where I can't
see<00:02:10.580> anything<00:02:10.729> like<00:02:10.940> kind<00:02:11.150> of<00:02:11.240> like<00:02:11.330> a<00:02:11.360> flash

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
see anything like kind of like a flash

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.120 
see anything like kind of like a flash
walk<00:02:11.959> yeah<00:02:12.140> and<00:02:12.410> you<00:02:12.470> probably<00:02:12.740> have<00:02:12.950> some

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
afterimage exactly I definitely I'm

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.810 
afterimage exactly I definitely I'm
after<00:02:14.930> him<00:02:15.110> is<00:02:15.170> just<00:02:15.350> like<00:02:15.500> a<00:02:15.530> big<00:02:15.800> like<00:02:16.310> green

temporarily blinding him and forcing the
vehicles<00:02:43.560> stop<00:02:44.209> it's<00:02:45.209> taking<00:02:45.599> pretty<00:02:45.959> much

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
vehicles stop it's taking pretty much

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.080

right<00:02:46.409> until<00:02:46.650> now<00:02:46.709> for<00:02:47.099> my<00:02:47.220> vision<00:02:47.610> to<00:02:47.730> really

one<00:02:50.610> yeah<00:02:50.909> and<00:02:50.939> that's<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.510> idea<00:02:51.810> is<00:02:51.900> you<00:02:52.409> get

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
one yeah and that's the idea is you get

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.149 
one yeah and that's the idea is you get
that<00:02:53.090> momentary<00:02:54.140> temporary<00:02:55.140> inability<00:02:55.739> to

focus<00:02:56.519> on<00:02:56.939> your<00:02:57.510> target<00:02:57.750> is<00:02:58.230> impressive<00:02:58.709> I

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
focus on your target is impressive I

00:02:58.769 --> 00:02:59.720

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
devices by the SWAT team vital seconds

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:30.770 
devices by the SWAT team vital seconds
as<00:03:29.319> they<00:03:29.680> gain<00:03:29.920> control<00:03:30.370> of<00:03:30.400> the<00:03:30.609> situation

without<00:03:31.780> any<00:03:32.170> casualties<00:03:34.560> why<00:03:35.560> did<00:03:35.709> that<00:03:35.859> work

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
without any casualties why did that work

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.789 
without any casualties why did that work
that<00:03:37.269> one<00:03:37.450> worked<00:03:37.659> I<00:03:37.840> think<00:03:37.870> a<00:03:38.290> lot<00:03:38.530> better

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
that one worked I think a lot better

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.979 
that one worked I think a lot better
because<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:39.579> officer<00:03:39.879> was<00:03:40.090> guarding<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:40.569> two

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
because the officer was guarding the two

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:42.869 
because the officer was guarding the two
doors<00:03:41.200> had<00:03:41.500> one<00:03:41.859> last<00:03:42.040> thing<00:03:42.159> to<00:03:42.310> do<00:03:42.579> he

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 
doors had one last thing to do he

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:45.149 
doors had one last thing to do he
discarded<00:03:43.780> one<00:03:43.959> door<00:03:44.170> and<00:03:44.379> he<00:03:44.469> the<00:03:45.010> other

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:45.159 
discarded one door and he the other

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:47.399 
discarded one door and he the other
device<00:03:45.430> guarded<00:03:46.389> the<00:03:46.480> second<00:03:46.810> door<00:03:46.959> I<00:03:47.200> think

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:47.409 
device guarded the second door I think

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:49.710 
device guarded the second door I think
it<00:03:48.010> would<00:03:48.129> be<00:03:48.280> one<00:03:48.609> less<00:03:48.819> place<00:03:49.359> that<00:03:49.599> an

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
it would be one less place that an

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.839 
it would be one less place that an
officer<00:03:50.019> has<00:03:50.200> to<00:03:50.409> be<00:03:50.859> concerned<00:03:51.310> about<00:03:51.430> it

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 
officer has to be concerned about it

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:55.079 
officer has to be concerned about it
would<00:03:52.030> produce<00:03:52.510> the<00:03:52.810> stress
