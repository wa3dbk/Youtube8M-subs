as we get in the beginning of semester
we<00:00:27.300> may<00:00:27.450> have<00:00:27.630> more<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.200> then<00:00:28.320> as<00:00:28.440> we<00:00:28.560> get

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
we may have more and then as we get

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.500 
we may have more and then as we get

actually it's really more the middle of
the<00:00:31.920> semester<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.820> becomes<00:00:33.440> less<00:00:34.440> because<00:00:34.890> of

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
the semester it becomes less because of
