00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:27.949 
gonna keep these fingers down go from A

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:48.800 
gonna keep these fingers down go from A
to<00:04:28.520> B<00:04:29.270> to<00:04:29.990> C<00:04:30.800> to<00:04:31.540> B<00:04:32.540> to<00:04:33.320> a

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.900 

you<00:04:49.350> can<00:04:49.500> also<00:04:49.620> practice<00:04:49.919> just<00:04:50.370> going<00:04:50.550> from<00:04:50.700> B

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
you can also practice just going from B

00:04:50.910 --> 00:05:00.830 
you can also practice just going from B
to<00:04:51.060> C<00:04:51.300> B<00:04:51.330> to<00:04:51.750> C<00:04:51.990> B<00:04:52.020> to<00:04:52.380> C<00:04:59.120> you<00:05:00.120> can<00:05:00.270> tongue<00:05:00.480> it<00:05:00.630> or

to C B to C B to C you can tongue it or

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:09.399 
to C B to C B to C you can tongue it or
then<00:05:01.080> you<00:05:01.110> could<00:05:01.350> just<00:05:01.590> try<00:05:01.770> to<00:05:01.830> slur<00:05:02.190> it

okay<00:05:10.409> and<00:05:10.559> then<00:05:10.650> the<00:05:10.740> last<00:05:10.979> thing<00:05:11.309> we<00:05:11.580> could

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:11.789 
okay and then the last thing we could

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:14.989 
okay and then the last thing we could
work<00:05:12.270> on<00:05:12.539> is<00:05:13.169> playing<00:05:13.559> the<00:05:13.680> C<00:05:13.919> scale<00:05:14.249> when<00:05:14.969> you

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.270 
it's not very very steady so I would

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.510 
it's not very very steady so I would
have<00:06:39.360> to<00:06:39.509> work<00:06:39.659> on<00:06:39.900> that<00:06:40.139> because<00:06:40.889> clarinet<00:06:41.400> is

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 
have to work on that because clarinet is

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.239 
have to work on that because clarinet is
not<00:06:41.639> my<00:06:41.759> main<00:06:41.939> instrument<00:06:42.259> okay<00:06:43.259> so<00:06:43.319> try<00:06:44.159> to
