00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.650
 Y 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:17.320
 hello good night my name is kaiser 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:22.540
 drum and today we will see in sony vegas 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:25.270
 it's worth a friend there is a doval 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:28.160
 Subscriber have given me a doubt and that is 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:32.330
 you want to know how you can do 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:35.360
 the effect of television without signal 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:38.590
 included the sound so this video 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:42.850
 well then in a video response for him 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:44.650
 We are going to open a new project and it is very 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.630
 easy 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:50.660
 we are going to go to media generators 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:53.600
 let's give solid color sony and 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.790
 let's put the target and we're going to 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.090
 bring here 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:01.690
 in the color is the white we are going to 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.690
 video effects 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:09.140
 and if I'm not wrong, I have to look for it 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:11.420
 ok because I have not done it is add 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.240
 noise 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.100
 we are going to put it to the extreme as 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.950
 we know how it's going to be dragged 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.539
 and we are going to put it to the limit 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.890
 here we will see that with this simple 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:26.330
 step we already have 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.760
 what is the 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:33.050
 the signal that there is no 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:36.800
 no sign is worth the redundancy now 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:39.290
 since we have this in agreement we're going 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.710
 to go to this web page called clip 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:45.380
 dj and let's look here you have it 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.820
 divine position signal of agreement 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:53.560
 television does not signal and we have it here 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.560
 we 're just going to download it 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.179
 we will appear here below now the 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.179
 discharge 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.990
 it's going to be this sound 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:26.879
 OK 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.420
 and we 're going to go I think I'll get the 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:34.970
 Download folder 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.780
 I do not have it I do not know why I could not 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.780
 download it 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.780
 so let's see let's give to 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.780
 behind 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.500
 I'm not looking for this other page 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.220
 and there we are going to put it again divine 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.220
 signal 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.030
 I do not know why it does not work 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:07.940
 but I think I already have it here 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:11.120
 we enter capture files 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:15.610
 in multimedia audios 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:18.320
 and indeed I have it here 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.220
 work works, it's worth once 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.220
 we have downloaded it 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.000
 we go to the program and what we are going to 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.670
 to do is to import 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.780
 the medium as we said was in 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.430
 material 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.510
 me because I have it here you what 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.510
 you can put where you want 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.510
 and we have it here we are going to start it 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.230
 and let's see how we already have 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:52.860
 our effect of no signal as extra if 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.730
 you want we can add another effect 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.690
 What is it 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.030
 the tv simulator 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:02.590
 and we're going to put more tuning 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.830
 then now let's see 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.110
 the signal effect because there was enough 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.000
 best 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.190
 sorry for the noise here we can see the 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.790
 interlaced that has the tuning 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:18.540
 linear in case we want the signal to be 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.540
 realize 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:27.360
 sorry 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:29.129
 we can touch him a lot very much 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.520
 because the signal we can do 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:31.520
 interference 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:38.520
 and well nothing here you have 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.520
 the video is a little bit the volume 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.520
 disastrous 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.670
 here is doval here you have the answer 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.640
 It's very easy, you just have to 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:53.750
 render it and copy the clip where 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:56.050
 You want it for nothing a greeting and up 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.050
 other
