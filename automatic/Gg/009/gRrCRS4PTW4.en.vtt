00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
for my hard disk boot priority when I

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.340 
for my hard disk boot priority when I
have<00:01:40.320> all<00:01:40.470> my<00:01:40.500> other<00:01:40.799> hard<00:01:41.040> drives<00:01:41.310> installed

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
have all my other hard drives installed

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.550 
have all my other hard drives installed
obviously<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.680> had<00:01:44.390> whichever<00:01:45.390> one<00:01:45.720> was

obviously I had whichever one was

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.859 
obviously I had whichever one was
hosting<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:48.560> OS<00:01:49.560> X<00:01:49.860> Snow<00:01:50.159> Leopard<00:01:50.310> as<00:01:51.060> the

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
primary hard drive to boot from and

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.209 
primary hard drive to boot from and
these<00:01:56.369> are<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.820> other<00:01:57.500> whose<00:01:58.500> first<00:01:58.950> boot

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
these are the other whose first boot

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.480 
these are the other whose first boot
device<00:01:59.250> and<00:02:00.030> whatnot<00:02:00.570> those<00:02:01.079> are<00:02:01.979> basically

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
device and whatnot those are basically

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.820 
device and whatnot those are basically
irrelevant<00:02:05.000> once<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.180> already<00:02:06.390> have<00:02:06.719> it<00:02:06.869> in

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
irrelevant once you already have it in

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.999 
irrelevant once you already have it in
so<00:02:08.100> integrated<00:02:08.970> peripherals<00:02:09.630> and<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.679> legacy

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
so integrated peripherals and the legacy

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.820 
so integrated peripherals and the legacy
devices<00:02:13.040> now<00:02:15.230> honestly<00:02:16.230> don't<00:02:16.500> even<00:02:16.560> know

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
devices now honestly don't even know

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.309 
devices now honestly don't even know
exactly<00:02:17.160> what<00:02:17.489> this<00:02:17.640> means<00:02:17.940> but<00:02:18.600> I<00:02:18.840> assume

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
exactly what this means but I assume

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.900 
exactly what this means but I assume
that<00:02:19.350> it's<00:02:19.709> just<00:02:19.920> for<00:02:20.130> your<00:02:20.550> front<00:02:21.330> panel<00:02:21.800> USB

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
that it's just for your front panel USB

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:29.150 
that it's just for your front panel USB
ports<00:02:23.910> or<00:02:24.270> if<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:24.660> had<00:02:27.230> one<00:02:28.230> of<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.500> adapters

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.430 
ports or if you had one of the adapters
provided<00:02:29.880> by<00:02:30.000> EVGA<00:02:30.630> with<00:02:31.410> your<00:02:31.590> motherboard

rear extra rear USB ports okay so we

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.309 
rear extra rear USB ports okay so we
have<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.340> HDI

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
have the HDI

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.090 
have the HDI
configurations<00:02:43.319> okay<00:02:44.160> this<00:02:45.060> is<00:02:45.269> how

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
configurations okay this is how

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.420 
configurations okay this is how
everything<00:02:47.100> is<00:02:47.220> here<00:02:47.850> and<00:02:49.190> I'm<00:02:50.190> not<00:02:50.370> sure

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
everything is here and I'm not sure

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.259 
everything is here and I'm not sure
exactly<00:02:51.300> what<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:52.380> cold<00:02:52.980> presence<00:02:53.730> detection

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
exactly what the cold presence detection

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.660 
exactly what the cold presence detection
is<00:02:55.459> but<00:02:56.459> apparently<00:02:56.850> I<00:02:57.269> have<00:02:57.510> it<00:02:57.660> disabled

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
is but apparently I have it disabled

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:05.390 
is but apparently I have it disabled
along<00:02:59.670> with<00:03:00.060> these<00:03:00.720> other<00:03:00.930> things<00:03:02.930> so<00:03:04.100> yes<00:03:05.100> and

irrelevant<00:03:20.900> options<00:03:21.900> as<00:03:22.350> well<00:03:23.660> now<00:03:24.660> here<00:03:25.140> we

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
irrelevant options as well now here we

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.460 
irrelevant options as well now here we
go<00:03:25.340> for<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.459> USB<00:03:26.790> settings<00:03:27.690> okay<00:03:29.120> so<00:03:30.260> this<00:03:31.260> is

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
go for the USB settings okay so this is

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.190 
go for the USB settings okay so this is
everything<00:03:32.010> here<00:03:33.500> everything<00:03:34.500> enabled<00:03:35.160> and

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
everything here everything enabled and

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:43.460

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.040 
USB operation mode high-speed which
I<00:03:44.930> don't<00:03:45.930> know<00:03:46.020> what<00:03:46.470> full<00:03:47.360> /lo<00:03:48.360> would<00:03:48.870> be

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
I don't know what full /lo would be

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.260 
I don't know what full /lo would be
because<00:03:49.350> if<00:03:49.470> it's<00:03:49.620> full<00:03:49.890> speed<00:03:50.150> you<00:03:51.150> would

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
because if it's full speed you would

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.320 
because if it's full speed you would
think<00:03:51.450> that<00:03:51.690> would<00:03:51.780> be<00:03:51.810> high<00:03:52.080> speed<00:03:52.880> sorry<00:03:53.880> my

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
think that would be high speed sorry my

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.060 
think that would be high speed sorry my
hands<00:03:55.110> are<00:03:55.230> a<00:03:55.500> little<00:03:55.560> shaky<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.850> moment<00:03:58.070> so

could get this overclock stable at a
lower<00:05:58.009> one<00:05:58.360> but<00:05:59.360> I<00:05:59.780> had<00:06:00.349> it<00:06:00.500> at<00:06:00.620> four<00:06:00.889> two<00:06:01.160> and

lower one but I had it at four two and

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.499 
lower one but I had it at four two and

just so I didn't run into any issues and
hackintosh<00:06:05.509> I<00:06:07.150> turned<00:06:08.150> it<00:06:08.360> down<00:06:08.569> because<00:06:08.840> I

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
hackintosh I turned it down because I

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.350 
hackintosh I turned it down because I
