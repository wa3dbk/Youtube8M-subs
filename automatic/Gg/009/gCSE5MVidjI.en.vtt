00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.139
 so again hello everyone i'm back and already 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:12.980
 with a mask and so to say how are you 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.660
 noticed i repainted my mask 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:19.380
 made her add touches like that 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.830
 beautiful did in general why am I so 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.830
 made for one simple reason because 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.830
 I'm tired of repainting it in one 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.099
 beautiful moment i got mad and started 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.930
 just stupid sanding your mask in honor 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:40.020
 what happened here are such beautiful 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:46.050
 touches as well as you noticed i 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:48.350
 glued mesh glued them on here 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.350
 that's glue 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.410
 it's shorter and some kind of sealant 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.739
 silicone 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:03.860
 he goes with that cap there all 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:07.190
 it will be clear so here I attached gum 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:11.570
 everything is normal 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:16.400
 I really fell off my chin but I 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:20.210
 it did Mazov here is such as it 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:24.250
 He called cold welding that's so like 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:27.020
 everything holds tight and does not collapse 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:31.640
 more I will not do anything with this 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:34.850
 mask she is completely ready to wear 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.060
 quite comfortable but also i forgot 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:41.270
 glue the liners 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.160
 so that was soft when wearing the mask but I 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.830
 I think that every time I will not her 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.830
 dressing is not she so easy for beauty 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.140
 what else to say well let's actually i 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.530
 I'll show you what she looks like right now. 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.530
 put on 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.030
 so qq 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:15.800
 That’s how it looks like it’s not 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:19.040
 crush nothing just i redid 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:23.470
 strengthened his chin and so I still 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.670
 did gum normal white however 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.220
 attached 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:34.460
 but the insert can be inserted of course that 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:35.920
 softer it was sometimes forcing there 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.880
 but tolerant 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:43.250
 but so actually if you wear balaclava 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:49.060
 let's do more like this 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.060
 balaclava terror q &amp; as now calls 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.510
 So 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.540
 we put on our mask 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.769
 not knowing how to put on a curved black mask 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:16.129
 Oh, more precisely, so that local here so here it is 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:20.690
 Looks like you just want the magic 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:23.000
 use lan kidding here's a black mask 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.739
 oh it was black put in a white mask with 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.739
 strokes what's there kinda pretty cool 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.739
 So 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:48.630
 on one mask I did not stop and 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:49.870
 I'm starting to make another, or rather, as if 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:58.090
 helmet mask 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:04:00.130
 i would too so here he himself is i will 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:07.860
 say give a mask this mask at all 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:11.890
 from the game as it is called arma 2 something 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:15.550
 Here is such a sweep of course 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.510
 very gummy glue the first part 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.060
 second part 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:22.260
 but this is something in the middle she does not 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:28.330
 stuck had to stick it 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:31.450
 masking tape that 's already going to be 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.490
 probably the next video why probably 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.260
 the next video will be on creation 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:39.580
 such 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:42.910
 Mask mask helmet so I will be 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:51.120
 strengthen and strengthen I will now 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:51.120
 wait see what it's called 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.770
 I will strengthen it with such a cloth 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:04.640
 as if the bandage and 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:10.530
 gauze for only very very tight and 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:13.350
 you know what kind of fabric is called up 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:17.610
 the fabric is called whose but why am I so 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:21.020
 yelled because the ending on base here 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:24.480
 I have several such fabrics 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:30.080
 I will dip them into this active 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:30.080
 pitch and apply to our helmet 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:42.000
 actually i also have less 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:46.710
 brush active resin and capacity where 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:50.760
 We will mix our purchase so I advise 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:53.460
 you don't just do well on cardboard like me 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:57.360
 I did this mask here 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:59.640
 put on cardboard and putty and everything 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:03.480
 to strengthen because when you strengthen 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:06.420
 it gets stronger better also 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:10.290
 add such nyashku that when gluing 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:11.390
 masks from and bleak from cardboard paste it 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:16.340
 super glue 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:21.150
 pva glue is not very long to dry 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:23.040
 long and drying you will have to 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:27.240
 to tell 

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:30.010
 when gluing, see each stroke 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:33.700
 went through all the glue otherwise you then 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:38.550
 shit roach as I have with my chin 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:41.340
 I did not stick together I went away 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:46.840
 5 had to redo 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:50.850
 Well, if you want, I will throw you a scan under 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.850
 video on this mask 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:59.230
 Well, there will also be a tutorial on creating 

00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:00.100
 this mask well, that's it with you 

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:04.540
 was the course 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:08.290
 It was a review on the mask but you yourself 

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:10.600
 the final part of my tutorial in it 

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:12.430
 probably all told what you 

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.400
 known but if you write in 

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:18.880
 comments that you do not understand something 

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:23.220
 buy that where everything will explain everything show 

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:23.220
 all all bye and good luck
