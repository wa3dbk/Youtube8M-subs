to<00:00:40.200> them<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.710> problem<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.219> is<00:00:41.460> fat<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:42.030> very

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
to them the problem is is fat is very

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.180 
to them the problem is is fat is very
rich<00:00:42.480> in<00:00:42.510> calories<00:00:42.930> there's<00:00:43.410> nine<00:00:43.739> calories

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
rich in calories there's nine calories

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.000 
rich in calories there's nine calories
per<00:00:44.640> gram<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.910> fat<00:00:45.270> so<00:00:46.050> I'm<00:00:46.379> not<00:00:46.559> sure<00:00:46.800> we're

per gram of fat so I'm not sure we're

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.160 
per gram of fat so I'm not sure we're
really<00:00:47.219> reducing<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.940> caloric<00:00:48.390> intake<00:00:48.809> for

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
really reducing the caloric intake for

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.410 
really reducing the caloric intake for
these<00:00:49.350> children<00:00:49.670> because<00:00:50.670> Tessa<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.270> great
