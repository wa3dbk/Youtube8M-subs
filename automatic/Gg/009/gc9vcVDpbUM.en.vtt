00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.420
 to change the kit of the heads of 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.400
 the printer what we have to do is 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.039
 first when in the car in the 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.809
 unloading position is cartridges a 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:18.670
 Once the car is located, what we do is 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.670
 remove the cartridges 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.840
 pulling up 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:32.579
 Once this is done, what we do is 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:37.609
 take out how safe they are 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.609
 the chips to be able to change 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:45.289
 and if you press down what you 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.980
 does is unlock the chip of the 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:49.640
 cartridges 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.640
 ah 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.810
 Once done, what we do is 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.680
 change the chip and put the same 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.680
 way it was pulled out 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.570
 we press until the peppers 

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:14.570
 the more correctly the cartridges 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.890
 once done is what we do is 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.890
 locate it again 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.490
 inside the head 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.490
 and we put pressure 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.740
 so that it is detected of the boys 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.470
 ah 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:19.340
 once done that is to the machine now 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.340
 I do not know the inks of the mind
