00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.460
 to be able to find you with this 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.859
 tutorial no make up make up which is in 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.200
 does somehow make-up of 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.019
 makeup that is supposed to be used 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.340
 to give an illusion of not 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.230
 wear makeup while sublimating 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.029
 even the complexion for my part I 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.560
 decided to keep options that I like 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.449
 bern as for round eyes and 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.340
 cetera but while keeping a good 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.570
 mine and especially keep your sides and 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.740
 national of the thing so it's gone 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.179
 to do it I advise you 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.099
 very very light thing you can 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.140
 just as well use just developer 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.940
 a corrector on the snowpark for 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.800
 wish to hide for my part I do not like 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.540
 use the tinted cream from your home 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.370
 to thank a tinted fear that 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.620
 mean without bringing too short years 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.850
 it is super light and a non fiber 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.489
 enough time 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.020
 she is hyper hyper natural and I you 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.289
 advise to apply the big n 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.910
 any founder fears and 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.699
 anything from liquid to sponge 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:01.079
 you will see that the natural effect is good 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:03.090
 top scorer 10 the prologue were from 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.890
 at mac who is a little beauty and 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.740
 finish that I like a lot I find 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.950
 enough covering useful very well and is the 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.350
 door they have a pretty natural side that 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.570
 so be it as you can see 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.360
 I am applying shock absorbers him also to 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.350
 a little point of light where there is 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.689
 tends to have a little higher and 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.490
 to apply the encircling I use l64 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.530
 of sigma which is great for bringing 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.329
 consistency while blurring matter 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.130
 correct and we go to the court of 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.530
 our passage the agents says angela 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.970
 beneficial I love I already have my only 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.890
 many times so I cover 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.200
 all the beaches there no 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.659
 only to mitigate what puts them back into 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.750
 seven steps it's going to fix multisalles and 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.479
 it will also cost the port part 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.520
 since this datum is a bit magical 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.799
 el fen effect seen talent to that 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.299
 I love causes him or made 17 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.579
 dead and wizards use the 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.840
 level which is a young boly matters of 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.119
 his flowing celi 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.859
 the little trots etc and it's great 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.450
 practice if you do not necessarily have that 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:05.340
 hit me athens on every race on 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.170
 intends to bring a small definition 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.119
 that not even me it's a 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.170
 product that I really loved using 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.790
 those last meters when I 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.019
 resumed makeup it's great 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.739
 practice that I really like the effect 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:18.629
 natural 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:20.670
 that's what they're going to go through to 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.470
 Compiegne is totally optional 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.750
 especially above all to consume who one is 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.360
 agree but here I thought 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.489
 especially to people who do not like 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.690
 bath worn on the eyes it could 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.420
 to be a good alternative 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.269
 we will be able to divino cream stone 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.090
 their dear rather bright it allows to 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:42.239
 let melt at easy sicard skin 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:49.769
 and fast and it's natural then we 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:52.620
 natural reason and 3 that will allow 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:57.260
 to tell you that we keep our evening 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:59.930
 to make the eyelashes fringe well 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.730
 heard create month under the lining 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:13.500
 higher for France at one learned 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:15.840
 it's pretty strong and the more 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.480
 mascara surprises is essential 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.220
 I use the word of all countries and 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.170
 masquerade that I love my power 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.060
 I really like to have very strong signs 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.190
 black is better and see you 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.900
 so after for the weekend but what 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.519
 precisely that might be more 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.690
 adapted from the freshness of more natural 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:35.010
 to be a bit but for my part even if 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.940
 the security is pretty black 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.290
 after that is the case by case of course but 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:44.069
 just as well equipped in masks 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.569
 marked for example for my part I 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.040
 replicated a little bit the embroiderer so 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.989
 it's totally optional 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.910
 makeup again and as I 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.709
 go shadow if you like years m 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.560
 but angles but my entry already 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.299
 touch-ups - but just at the level of 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.489
 the skeleton of the cheeks to bring a 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.319
 little more heat to montain 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.940
 logs in all lightness people but 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.240
 no masses we saw that will be very 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.010
 light 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.050
 for the blush I advise you to opt 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.210
 rather for an attack on his rosÃ©s which 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.310
 looks good for a finish 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.680
 satin lightly especially papa was 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.630
 even come lightly satin that will you 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.730
 give this title as more than this little 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.090
 thing that makes good-looking effect all of 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.520
 after 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.500
 you know I like to have this side a little 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.830
 little noise so where we read 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.000
 minor 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.740
 again it's not that 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.450
 tactical and I really like to work 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.220
 the time for this kind of makeup 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.740
 even if it is fast and so on 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.480
 is longer than it did I use 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.520
 the powder with 20 places which is a hen 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.830
 so much movie she sees herself 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.900
 barely but the door of this pretty little 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.610
 side light effect on the skin that has 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.290
 so rally seems to edit the glitter 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.870
 and rather prepare something pretty 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.490
 satin and very light 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.660
 almost natural that are quick to the 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.820
 poor a few days a little bit for 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:56.380
 me if you want to safer one of the most 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:58.240
 natural or jaeme I was just a base 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.010
 on the wall of your place of the myth of China 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.600
 red mark applies so just in 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.610
 below to have a have in very net 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.620
 withdrawal place of maths where this one 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.940
 would suffice the argument but I like 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.740
 added a little more 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.690
 best in this is a little bit 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.550
 more dewy and not too much in which too 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.490
 our race to my for that I use 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:18.040
 the best shade for at revlon 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.780
 regards the latest cowboys who 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:23.290
 is super nice and I love 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:26.680
 the association super nice but at the same 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:29.050
 more living time at the 105th rather 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.510
 well with the whole picture the 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:36.550
 tramp at full rate will pay 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:37.870
 the university make up make up and that's the 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.280
 title and finish them I hope 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.170
 Sincerely you will have enjoyed it was 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.090
 not to say that you thought of editing 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.980
 from this garage does this song from him 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.010
 see the half-hour kisses and at very 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.010
 soon
