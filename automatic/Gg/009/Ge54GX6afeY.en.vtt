nothing game but you want to win it
obviously<00:00:14.849> because<00:00:15.120> you<00:00:15.299> know<00:00:15.420> first<00:00:15.750> that's

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
obviously because you know first that's

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.450 
obviously because you know first that's
why<00:00:16.440> you're<00:00:16.619> there<00:00:16.740> isn't<00:00:17.100> it<00:00:17.160> you<00:00:17.310> know<00:00:17.400> what

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
why you're there isn't it you know what

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.820 
why you're there isn't it you know what
I<00:00:17.520> mean<00:00:17.550> but<00:00:17.850> it's<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.990> community<00:00:19.439> shield<00:00:19.650> but

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
I mean but it's the community shield but

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.279 
I mean but it's the community shield but
because<00:00:20.039> its<00:00:20.189> arsenal<00:00:20.840> you<00:00:21.840> know<00:00:21.990> it's

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
because its arsenal you know it's

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.070 
because its arsenal you know it's
slightly<00:00:22.590> bigger<00:00:22.859> than<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.369> normal<00:00:23.910> game<00:00:24.300> I

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
slightly bigger than a normal game I

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.230 
slightly bigger than a normal game I
think<00:00:25.859> it's<00:00:26.010> bigger<00:00:26.189> for<00:00:26.279> Arsenal<00:00:26.880> than<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.119> is

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
think it's bigger for Arsenal than it is

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.790 
think it's bigger for Arsenal than it is
for<00:00:27.359> Chelsea<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.289> don't<00:00:28.500> mean<00:00:28.619> any
