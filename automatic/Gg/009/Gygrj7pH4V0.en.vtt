00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.400
 the classified documents that we find echoing by implying that the 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.650
 domain has a creative laboratory weapons top secret on a platform 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.619
 unitary shell 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:16.619
 the sky is preparing a big surprise for us would like 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.999
 know what it is 

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:22.999
 Jun 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.470
 I saw that susan boyle these secret labs of death 

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:34.440
 this asteroid is registered as a merida storage warehouse but 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.480
 that must be a cover for the biologist luis miguel dominguín 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.820
 since its premiere we lived like fools if you had come here 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.390
 for some comments 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.590
 the documents of cession to the consumption that the domain was plotting 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.060
 but if they had some complex security codes so it's 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.060
 possible that we can infiltrate their systems 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.420
 it seems fun good since we are here we could take a look 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.650
 sr some parts of the complex seems to have excuses and scanning 

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.469
 our signals are interrupted everywhere 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:13.809
 be careful 

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:16.809
 ediles not everything is my middle name 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.529
 you said it was a genius aspect 

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:22.139
 these systems 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:23.510
 he is fine gentlemen 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.510
 keep alert 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:29.809
 happen to you 

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:31.630
 surprise surprise 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.749
 the door is besieged 

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:36.769
 nothing that does not cover a transfer charge 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:38.249
 sounds good 

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:41.249
 in January 

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:46.249
 he explained that he does is strictly respect 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.629
 not yet 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:08.429
 and we will do it 

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:11.069
 it seems that a welcome committee awaits us 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:12.050
 he added 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.050
 activists armed turrets so we're single surprise 

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:20.199
 Access to the victims by decoding the cancellation of security systems 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:23.469
 points 16 more is to say 

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:24.349
 flight 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:28.680
 same we have half of the weapons with that we should already be able to eliminate the 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.680
 half of them 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:47.009
 Amen 

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:50.009
 several local media 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:54.680
 these creatures were not presented any mixed service 

00:03:55.779 --> 00:03:59.539
 bin laden from the study signals the moment 

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:01.809
 the signs of weakening 

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:04.269
 spiegel 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.439
 I'm detecting venice broken equipment 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:08.880
 it will be that those 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.379
 things had been assimilated 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:16.359
 but I am very curious to know what they are doing in a dr laboratory 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.169
 we have recipe from king nora trapped in the laboratory one 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.550
 adriana good if we win anything 

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:41.249
 previous studies periods of what I speak 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:47.969
 jorge barraza 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:49.879
 then they come 

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:52.879
 you can count on me 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:02.229
 low 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:03.389
 they escaped 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:06.210
 those sites 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.210
 the rebels stole it now from 

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:11.330
 but alone 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.330
 sounds good 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:24.879
 rebels to steal 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:26.740
 sounds good 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.820
 can j keep the good news 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.620
 work of this man 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.680
 sometimes lets steal time to be a man 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.469
 the opposite 

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:51.469
 torroba 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:59.169
 you can count on me 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:04.050
 in this terminal there are things that we could use to soften the bosses 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.050
 of State 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.580
 in the general 

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:45.300
 it seems as if the same creature has been voted and cloned again and again 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.680
 martínez infovision al 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.580
 this week he has been doing some tests etc 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.879
 says that the chains of ade n of the specimens were spliced 

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:55.249
 artificially 

00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:58.519
 whether he's in charge of that crap he intentionally did 

00:07:03.399 --> 00:07:05.169
 thousands of naked women 

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:07.439
 we can not leave them and as is 

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:11.279
 well I'm detecting a very strong energy signal near you 

00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:14.339
 there must be a large fusion reactor lagoon part of the complex 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:15.830
 perfect 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:19.330
 we will find the reactor we will destroy them and then we will launch 

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:20.639
 here 

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:22.159
 rebels to steal 

00:07:22.159 --> 00:07:26.340
 it is proven that these weapons in the specimens yesterday were doing 

00:07:26.339 --> 00:07:27.779
 here 

00:07:27.779 --> 00:07:30.189
 sounds good 

00:07:30.189 --> 00:07:30.899
 soul
