00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
artists you know like I guess making a

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.749 
artists you know like I guess making a
move<00:01:49.880> from<00:01:49.970> here<00:01:50.180> to<00:01:50.270> Toronto<00:01:50.780> I<00:01:51.049> I<00:01:51.979> think<00:01:52.520> it's

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
move from here to Toronto I I think it's

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.999 
move from here to Toronto I I think it's
all<00:01:53.090> really<00:01:53.329> what<00:01:53.600> you<00:01:53.780> want<00:01:54.020> I<00:01:54.259> mean<00:01:54.830> if

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
all really what you want I mean if

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:56.859 
all really what you want I mean if
that's<00:01:55.430> your<00:01:55.700> choice<00:01:56.149> if<00:01:56.479> that's<00:01:56.689> your

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
that's your choice if that's your

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:58.929 
that's your choice if that's your
decision<00:01:57.049> that<00:01:57.530> you<00:01:57.679> that<00:01:58.189> you<00:01:58.250> feel<00:01:58.549> you<00:01:58.729> want

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
decision that you that you feel you want

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:00.279 
decision that you that you feel you want
you<00:01:59.030> want<00:01:59.299> to<00:01:59.360> do<00:01:59.509> that<00:01:59.539> to<00:01:59.810> pursue<00:02:00.140> your

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
you want to do that to pursue your

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.499 
you want to do that to pursue your
career<00:02:00.560> that's<00:02:01.009> cool<00:02:01.250> like<00:02:01.580> I<00:02:01.820> think<00:02:02.270> it<00:02:02.360> is<00:02:02.390> a

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
career that's cool like I think it is a

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:04.630 
career that's cool like I think it is a
smart<00:02:02.899> moving<00:02:03.110> away<00:02:03.320> but<00:02:03.710> I<00:02:03.740> don't<00:02:04.070> think<00:02:04.399> it's

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
smart moving away but I don't think it's

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.760 
smart moving away but I don't think it's
necessary<00:02:05.240> at<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:05.539> same<00:02:05.750> time<00:02:05.990> with<00:02:06.679> the
