a little demo Michael what makes that
track<00:00:10.920> so<00:00:11.250> iconic<00:00:11.730> so<00:00:11.910> special<00:00:12.390> I<00:00:12.570> don't<00:00:13.320> know

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:13.560 
track so iconic so special I don't know

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.110 
track so iconic so special I don't know
to<00:00:13.620> be<00:00:13.710> honest<00:00:14.010> it<00:00:14.190> I<00:00:14.340> suppose<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.880> Dunlop

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
to be honest it I suppose the Dunlop

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.730 
to be honest it I suppose the Dunlop
bridge<00:00:15.180> for<00:00:15.600> a<00:00:15.660> start<00:00:15.900> and<00:00:16.020> I<00:00:16.260> think<00:00:16.529> it's<00:00:16.619> more

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
bridge for a start and I think it's more

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.170 
bridge for a start and I think it's more
of<00:00:16.769> a<00:00:16.859> Dillon<00:00:17.070> 124<00:00:17.580> oh<00:00:17.609> that<00:00:17.850> gives<00:00:17.970> it<00:00:18.150> that

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
of a Dillon 124 oh that gives it that

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.090 
of a Dillon 124 oh that gives it that
iconic<00:00:18.780> status<00:00:18.960> because<00:00:19.620> as<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.860> racetrack

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
iconic status because as a racetrack
