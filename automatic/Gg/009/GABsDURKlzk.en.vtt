00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:18.340
 I do not remember what I say so 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.720
 Honestly we would be around then 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.779
 a lot in the last few weeks 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.900
 scale in the last three weeks 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.420
 limit of the poker game times out and 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.830
 championship and we win 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.279
 not the things and that's easy 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.200
 what a shame 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.060
 yes I think so, we have the game 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.010
 Well started and exactly two 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.430
 days over 80 cabin had come 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.680
 incredible 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.980
 up to 80 meter properly forward 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:45.050
 made and have until the 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.570
 Bachelor Degree Yes I think I think 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.860
 militant and of the moral also of 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.030
 a tactical order of 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.010
 playful I think so 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.510
 the things largely in the square 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.460
 brought in the were 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.539
 which of course we were missing though 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.190
 big difference between the two 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.680
 Team was, of course, that 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.050
 Efficiency in the last decisive 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.090
 thirds of the square speak own 16 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.490
 in the opponent has become easy 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.710
 much more determined by sayings 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.050
 we did not look great 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.970
 tor our ex player dennis grote 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.540
 scored volley decline and then up in 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.400
 the angle 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.830
 Of course that was already extra class in the 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.260
 hinspiel enough the depp today I am 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.470
 the happy one and we as a whole 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.000
 Team Yes I think that we are today 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.750
 the deserved winners are I believe we 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.800
 have made a pretty good home game 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.180
 but you also saw that mÃ¼nster 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.619
 despite the negative results of the last 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.100
 has played very well today and weeks 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.690
 I think that also makes for the boys courage 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.570
 It was the last three games again 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.020
 had to play against the old guys 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:53.340
 oh that's always something special 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:56.740
 sometimes a little something funny then 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.660
 Of course, it's never easy when it comes to that 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.009
 a lot goes for both teams but 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.520
 I think that today have very good drum 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.170
 Mercedes clearly finished fourth 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.350
 I think that we are the fans club 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.489
 guilty that we do everything for it too 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.500
 for ourselves that we actually have one 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.209
 season the long time very good for us 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.739
 Running is not easy now 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.530
 throw away but we have kickers 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.160
 next week in front of the chest and there must 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.560
 a victory 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.160
 then the space is realistic 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.160
 but only then
