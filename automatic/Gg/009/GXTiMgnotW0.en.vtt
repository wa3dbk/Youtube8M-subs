00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.580 
eye of ender and we can go to the end
worlds<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.640> it's<00:00:39.360> just<00:00:39.570> going<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.780> be<00:00:39.870> epic<00:00:40.079> of

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590

course<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.100> will<00:00:41.190> be<00:00:41.340> much<00:00:41.610> better<00:00:41.640> if<00:00:42.090> we<00:00:42.239> were

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
course it will be much better if we were

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.720 
course it will be much better if we were
in<00:00:42.600> survival<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.590> will<00:00:43.770> be<00:00:43.890> much<00:00:44.190> Haggard

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
in survival it will be much Haggard

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.240 
in survival it will be much Haggard
order<00:00:45.270> I'm<00:00:45.480> sorry<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.930> much<00:00:46.829> you're

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
interesting in all the way that we kill

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.740 
interesting in all the way that we kill
them<00:00:49.500> because<00:00:49.950> we<00:00:50.280> will<00:00:50.850> lose<00:00:51.059> different

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
them because we will lose different

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.930 
them because we will lose different
tactics<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:53.160> know<00:00:53.250> like<00:00:53.520> this<00:00:53.730> it's

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
tactics and you know like this it's

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.540 
tactics and you know like this it's
quite<00:00:54.360> easy<00:00:54.390> but<00:00:55.379> yeah<00:00:55.500> we<00:00:55.710> collected<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.340> egg

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
quite easy but yeah we collected the egg

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.290 
quite easy but yeah we collected the egg
in<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.879> end<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.390> course<00:00:58.050> with<00:00:58.469> them<00:00:59.149> you<00:01:00.149> have

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
in the end of course with them you have

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.490 
in the end of course with them you have
to<00:01:00.449> use<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:02.420> piston<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.570> know<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.199> lever

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
to use the piston you know and the lever

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.490 
to use the piston you know and the lever
so<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.280> can<00:01:05.640> collect<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.600> egg<00:01:06.810> when<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.229> kill

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
so you can collect the egg when you kill

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.100 
so you can collect the egg when you kill
the<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.880> know<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.240> Enderdragon<00:01:09.869> but

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
the the you know the Enderdragon but

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.740 
the the you know the Enderdragon but
it's<00:01:10.229> pretty<00:01:10.560> epic<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:12.000> think<00:01:12.270> this<00:01:12.390> update

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
it's pretty epic and I think this update

really cool and there's just 36

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.120 
really cool and there's just 36
megabytes<00:01:18.180> it's<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.750> really<00:01:19.049> fast<00:01:19.350> updates<00:01:19.920> and

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130
