and the fact that we got some more dirt

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.409 
and the fact that we got some more dirt
for<00:00:20.169> one<00:00:20.320> of<00:00:20.439> our<00:00:20.529> Arizona<00:00:20.890> claims<00:00:21.460> mission

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:22.419 
for one of our Arizona claims mission

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:24.479 
for one of our Arizona claims mission
where<00:00:22.599> I<00:00:22.840> want<00:00:23.770> to<00:00:23.800> show<00:00:23.980> you<00:00:24.040> something

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
misconception about this okay here's

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.459 
misconception about this okay here's
some<00:00:30.189> of<00:00:30.220> the<00:00:30.719> clay<00:00:31.719> that<00:00:31.750> we've<00:00:32.050> been<00:00:32.169> getting

00:00:32.459 --> 00:00:32.469 
some of the clay that we've been getting

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:34.650 
some of the clay that we've been getting
off<00:00:32.529> the<00:00:32.800> clay<00:00:33.250> Chi<00:00:33.430> which<00:00:34.210> is<00:00:34.330> a<00:00:34.360> false

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
off the clay Chi which is a false

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.380 
off the clay Chi which is a false
bedrock<00:00:35.280> in<00:00:36.280> northern<00:00:36.730> Arizona

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
bedrock in northern Arizona

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.910 
bedrock in northern Arizona
you<00:00:37.540> see<00:00:37.810> it's<00:00:37.930> gray<00:00:38.110> it's<00:00:38.140> got<00:00:38.440> a<00:00:38.470> lot<00:00:38.650> of<00:00:38.680> iron

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
you see it's gray it's got a lot of iron

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.230 
you see it's gray it's got a lot of iron
oxide<00:00:39.400> in<00:00:39.550> it<00:00:39.580> okay<00:00:40.590> when<00:00:41.590> you<00:00:41.680> go<00:00:41.830> out<00:00:42.240> you

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:43.240 
oxide in it okay when you go out you

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.180 
oxide in it okay when you go out you
should<00:00:43.450> test<00:00:43.690> pan<00:00:43.990> first<00:00:44.290> obviously<00:00:44.860> to<00:00:45.010> see

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
should test pan first obviously to see

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.430 
should test pan first obviously to see
if<00:00:45.250> you<00:00:45.430> got<00:00:45.580> any<00:00:45.790> placer<00:00:46.210> gold<00:00:46.240> there<00:00:46.570> best

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
if you got any placer gold there best

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.160 
if you got any placer gold there best
way<00:00:47.590> to<00:00:47.620> do<00:00:47.829> it<00:00:47.920> if<00:00:48.010> you're<00:00:48.130> working<00:00:48.310> with<00:00:48.520> clay

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
way to do it if you're working with clay

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.630 
way to do it if you're working with clay
is<00:00:50.170> you<00:00:50.380> put<00:00:50.590> some<00:00:50.770> of<00:00:50.890> that<00:00:50.920> material<00:00:51.490> in<00:00:51.610> your

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
is you put some of that material in your

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.930 
is you put some of that material in your
pan<00:00:52.470> like<00:00:53.470> this<00:00:53.500> you've<00:00:54.010> got<00:00:54.190> the<00:00:54.340> classifier

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
pan like this you've got the classifier

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.770 
pan like this you've got the classifier
on<00:00:55.180> top<00:00:55.450> so<00:00:55.660> yeah<00:00:56.790> the<00:00:57.790> easiest<00:00:58.360> way<00:00:58.510> to<00:00:58.540> do

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
on top so yeah the easiest way to do

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.400 
on top so yeah the easiest way to do
that<00:00:58.810> is<00:00:59.800> you<00:00:59.980> just<00:01:00.130> dunk<00:01:00.520> it<00:01:00.640> into<00:01:00.790> water<00:01:01.410> and

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
that is you just dunk it into water and

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.439 
that is you just dunk it into water and
you<00:01:02.770> shake<00:01:03.130> in<00:01:03.310> here<00:01:03.489> grind<00:01:04.030> up<00:01:04.180> all<00:01:04.329> those

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
you shake in here grind up all those

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.760 
you shake in here grind up all those
little<00:01:04.689> clay<00:01:04.869> balls<00:01:05.140> in<00:01:05.379> there<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:08.590> yeah

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
little clay balls in there and yeah

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.880 
little clay balls in there and yeah
you're<00:01:09.070> gonna<00:01:09.190> get<00:01:09.340> wet

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.370 

how<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:13.950> can<00:01:14.130> do<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.340> in<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.549> tub<00:01:14.789> or

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
how you can do that in a tub or

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.639 
how you can do that in a tub or
five-gallon<00:01:16.380> bucket<00:01:16.770> or<00:01:16.920> what<00:01:17.069> have<00:01:17.249> you<00:01:17.479> but

five-gallon bucket or what have you but

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:20.870 
five-gallon bucket or what have you but
when<00:01:19.649> you're<00:01:19.740> classifying<00:01:20.189> clay<00:01:20.460> that's<00:01:20.759> the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
when you're classifying clay that's the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.300 
when you're classifying clay that's the
easiest<00:01:21.299> way<00:01:21.569> to<00:01:21.600> do<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.229> don't<00:01:22.920> forget

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
easiest way to do it and don't forget

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.429 
easiest way to do it and don't forget
shake<00:01:24.240> shake<00:01:24.509> shake<00:01:24.539> shake<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:25.259> thing

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
really hard because you got a Stratus

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.440 
really hard because you got a Stratus

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
going to be anything in the pan right

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.330 
going to be anything in the pan right
here<00:01:51.439> and<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.560> don't<00:01:52.770> recommend<00:01:53.039> that<00:01:53.250> you

here and I don't recommend that you
should<00:01:53.399> pan<00:01:53.729> this<00:01:53.969> fast<00:01:54.270> when<00:01:54.509> your<00:01:54.659> test<00:01:54.899> pan

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
should pan this fast when your test pan

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:05.130 
should pan this fast when your test pan
because<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.250> could<00:01:56.399> lose<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.579> lot<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.030> material

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
can see I got tons of black sand and see

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.440 
can see I got tons of black sand and see
these<00:02:12.350> big<00:02:12.590> chunks<00:02:12.980> of<00:02:13.209> magnetite<00:02:14.209> that<00:02:14.360> are

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
these big chunks of magnetite that are

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.620 
these big chunks of magnetite that are
in<00:02:14.540> there<00:02:14.660> right<00:02:14.990> there<00:02:15.260> you<00:02:16.190> know<00:02:16.280> that<00:02:16.630> okay
