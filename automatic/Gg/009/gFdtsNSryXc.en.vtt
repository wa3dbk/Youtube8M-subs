when<00:02:33.569> I<00:02:33.599> put<00:02:33.870> it<00:02:33.989> on<00:02:34.860> top<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.459> pencil<00:02:35.790> case

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
when I put it on top the pencil case

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.020 
when I put it on top the pencil case
inside<00:02:37.200> there<00:02:37.950> only<00:02:38.190> be<00:02:38.310> lime<00:02:38.519> green<00:02:38.790> tape

will be only zebra tape and no lime

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.559 
will be only zebra tape and no lime
green<00:02:42.810> so<00:02:43.230> this<00:02:43.349> makes<00:02:43.590> it<00:02:43.769> look<00:02:44.040> more<00:02:44.819> clean

green so this makes it look more clean
and<00:02:45.840> professional<00:02:46.049> I<00:02:46.560> guess<00:02:47.540> so<00:02:48.540> you're<00:02:48.660> gonna

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
and professional I guess so you're gonna

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.680 
and professional I guess so you're gonna
stick<00:02:49.049> it<00:02:49.230> on<00:02:50.010> top<00:02:50.340> you're<00:02:51.180> gonna<00:02:51.299> stick<00:02:51.569> it

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
stick it on top you're gonna stick it

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.009 
stick it on top you're gonna stick it
like<00:02:51.810> all<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.079> way<00:02:52.200> at<00:02:52.319> the<00:02:52.470> top<00:02:52.769> and<00:02:53.390> then<00:02:54.390> you

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
like all the way at the top and then you

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.860 
like all the way at the top and then you
should<00:02:55.079> have<00:02:55.379> zebra<00:02:55.709> hanging<00:02:56.310> over<00:02:56.870> and

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
you're gonna fold it over so you have

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.520 
you're gonna fold it over so you have
you<00:03:02.250> ziploc<00:03:02.670> stuck<00:03:03.000> on<00:03:03.239> I<00:03:03.510> just<00:03:04.079> flattened<00:03:04.470> out

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
you ziploc stuck on I just flattened out

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.500 
you ziploc stuck on I just flattened out
really<00:03:04.739> good<00:03:04.920> so<00:03:05.130> you<00:03:05.579> know<00:03:05.790> you<00:03:06.209> know<00:03:06.329> for

really good so you know you know for
sure<00:03:06.540> it'll<00:03:06.959> stay<00:03:07.260> on<00:03:07.400> I'm<00:03:08.400> gonna<00:03:08.639> make<00:03:08.819> a

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
sure it'll stay on I'm gonna make a

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.610 
sure it'll stay on I'm gonna make a
duplicate<00:03:09.389> of<00:03:09.450> that<00:03:09.690> with<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.109> other<00:03:10.260> side<00:03:10.500> of

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
duplicate of that with the other side of

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.110 
duplicate of that with the other side of
the<00:03:10.709> Ziploc<00:03:11.100> so<00:03:12.060> when<00:03:12.180> you<00:03:12.299> finish<00:03:12.510> doing<00:03:12.900> that

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
the Ziploc so when you finish doing that

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.390 
the Ziploc so when you finish doing that
you're<00:03:15.120> gonna<00:03:15.209> stick<00:03:15.720> your<00:03:16.019> gonna<00:03:16.920> zip<00:03:17.190> lock

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
you're gonna stick your gonna zip lock

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:24.979 
you're gonna stick your gonna zip lock
it<00:03:17.609> together<00:03:22.190> like<00:03:23.190> that<00:03:23.480> so<00:03:24.480> it<00:03:24.599> can't<00:03:24.870> move

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
it together like that so it can't move

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.370

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
pencil case and I felt how a surface

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.580 
pencil case and I felt how a surface
you're<00:04:18.109> working<00:04:18.139> on<00:04:18.470> flip<00:04:19.130> it<00:04:19.280> over<00:04:19.430> and<00:04:19.820> fold

you're working on flip it over and fold
it<00:04:21.590> over<00:04:21.729> and<00:04:22.729> smooth<00:04:23.450> it<00:04:23.570> out<00:04:23.630> so<00:04:24.110> there's<00:04:24.290> no

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
it over and smooth it out so there's no

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.879 
it over and smooth it out so there's no
air<00:04:24.560> bubbles<00:04:25.389> and<00:04:26.389> do<00:04:26.690> the<00:04:26.840> act<00:04:26.990> do<00:04:27.440> the<00:04:27.560> exact

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:27.889 
air bubbles and do the act do the exact

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:35.830 
air bubbles and do the act do the exact
same<00:04:27.919> thing<00:04:28.340> to<00:04:28.639> the<00:04:28.940> opposite<00:04:29.900> side<00:04:34.270> so<00:04:35.270> here

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
same thing to the opposite side so here

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.760 
same thing to the opposite side so here
you<00:04:36.290> have<00:04:36.560> your<00:04:36.590> ziploc<00:04:37.520> pencil<00:04:38.060> case

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
you have your ziploc pencil case

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.110
