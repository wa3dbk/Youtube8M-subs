00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:09.150
 hello my new video was together 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:14.280
 Konrad has something for me today 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:17.400
 wanted and once the keys 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.140
 This was where I was actually dealing 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.369
 the key for the track adjustment 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.470
 with miles of cars I have that right away 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.279
 whole set can be repeated 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:33.180
 then use once in model making 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:36.840
 Air filter 11 8 euro a little expensive but 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.879
 I do not care and mainly went 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.260
 It squad me a mini 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:46.280
 because I wanted for my cars 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.079
 screw together or apart 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.000
 small holes bor 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.699
 for something that is sufficiently wanted me 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.610
 actually a cheaper horn of 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.250
 Tall Kraft for the turnover I think 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.000
 The gentleman before I looked at him 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:07.229
 live because I'm not so excited anymore 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.619
 because of bad workmanship 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.750
 button the clamps or the weight 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.390
 is pretty hard compared to 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.869
 which they did not look at next 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.909
 have and that seems enthusiastic about 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.909
 the courage of the processing 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:30.869
 So you say that two of the price 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.200
 100 euro but no matter you have fun longer 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.530
 in order to 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:39.039
 you can drill holes with it 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:44.920
 I know these holes but for 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:47.520
 Model construction is enough to screw it out 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:52.689
 Ten per word will not be my kilo 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:02:05.740
 and supposedly has three hours to help 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:02:08.200
 Also not built mock mouse is 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:15.660
 the suitcase is i think the guys 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:19.989
 instruction of cabinets is charging cable 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:23.530
 here is the battery screwdriver pretty 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:26.620
 good workmanship here in front have that 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.860
 light is also really good in the hand 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:33.510
 and the business yes, I have it once 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.799
 held here and then turned 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:41.920
 the rotation through the has a lot 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:44.920
 power for such a small device because of it 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.810
 I have the castle no matter what 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.910
 invests and has fun with it for a long time 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.450
 something cheap instead of something like that 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:55.569
 can see is broken or the battery 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.639
 no longer holds the gear or what 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.220
 always 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:04.739
 because I have several things from bosch 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.739
 and I'm actually happy with it 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:11.250
 yes what actually for today is the 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.510
 video is probably on saturday 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:18.420
 and I would be glad if you were there 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.420
 so be bye
