because<00:03:06.500> um<00:03:06.890> I<00:03:07.180> don't<00:03:08.180> use<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:08.570> pic<00:03:08.780> and<00:03:09.280> it

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
because um I don't use the pic and it

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.759 
because um I don't use the pic and it
was<00:03:10.430> a<00:03:10.459> decision<00:03:10.970> quite<00:03:11.720> a<00:03:11.780> while<00:03:11.989> ago<00:03:12.260> to<00:03:12.320> to

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
was a decision quite a while ago to to

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.390 
was a decision quite a while ago to to
not<00:03:12.920> use<00:03:13.130> a<00:03:13.160> pig<00:03:13.489> because<00:03:14.209> um<00:03:14.650> you<00:03:15.650> know<00:03:15.769> five

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
not use a pig because um you know five

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.430 
not use a pig because um you know five
is<00:03:16.549> better<00:03:16.579> than<00:03:16.940> one<00:03:17.150> you<00:03:17.840> know<00:03:17.930> but<00:03:18.140> still

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
is better than one you know but still

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.289 
is better than one you know but still
there<00:03:18.709> detriments<00:03:19.220> are<00:03:19.310> not<00:03:19.430> using<00:03:19.760> a<00:03:19.820> pic<00:03:20.030> you

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
there detriments are not using a pic you

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.150 
there detriments are not using a pic you
you<00:03:20.510> can't<00:03:20.810> really<00:03:21.109> alternate<00:03:21.650> pick<00:03:21.859> which<00:03:22.130> is

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
you can't really alternate pick which is

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.570 
you can't really alternate pick which is
you<00:03:22.400> know

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.830 

which<00:03:25.580> makes<00:03:25.850> it<00:03:25.970> a<00:03:26.030> lot<00:03:26.150> easier<00:03:26.210> cuz<00:03:26.660> you<00:03:26.720> can

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
which makes it a lot easier cuz you can

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.040 
which makes it a lot easier cuz you can
just<00:03:28.090> right<00:03:29.090> now<00:03:29.180> I<00:03:29.210> just<00:03:29.300> have<00:03:29.510> my<00:03:29.720> thumb<00:03:29.930> and

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
just right now I just have my thumb and

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.380 
just right now I just have my thumb and
my<00:03:30.110> finger<00:03:30.230> so<00:03:30.560> I<00:03:30.590> have<00:03:30.680> to<00:03:30.770> alternate<00:03:31.300> so<00:03:32.300> took

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
my finger so I have to alternate so took

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.500 
my finger so I have to alternate so took
a<00:03:32.630> long<00:03:32.840> time<00:03:32.870> to<00:03:33.110> practice<00:03:34.360> so<00:03:35.360> that's

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
a long time to practice so that's

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.070 
a long time to practice so that's
actually<00:03:35.660> my<00:03:35.900> thumb<00:03:36.170> and<00:03:36.320> my<00:03:36.410> index<00:03:36.440> going<00:03:38.080> so

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
actually my thumb and my index going so

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.020 
actually my thumb and my index going so
I'll<00:03:39.170> practice<00:03:39.560> using<00:03:40.400> that<00:03:40.520> and<00:03:40.670> keeping<00:03:40.970> it

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
I'll practice using that and keeping it

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:48.310 
I'll practice using that and keeping it
clean<00:03:43.510> and<00:03:44.510> then<00:03:44.990> look<00:03:45.260> at<00:03:45.380> oh<00:03:45.410> -<00:03:47.200> then<00:03:48.200> I'll

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
clean and then look at oh - then I'll

00:03:48.320 --> 00:04:04.720 
clean and then look at oh - then I'll
practice<00:03:48.710> uhm<00:03:48.950> thing<00:03:49.700> with<00:03:49.820> one<00:03:50.000> hand

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.129 

you<00:04:05.730> know<00:04:05.849> practice<00:04:06.239> with<00:04:06.359> one<00:04:06.540> hand<00:04:06.810> and<00:04:07.019> then

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:07.139 
you know practice with one hand and then

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:09.949 
you know practice with one hand and then
I<00:04:07.590> practice<00:04:08.370> just<00:04:08.549> muting<00:04:08.879> this<00:04:09.090> and<00:04:09.840> just

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
I practice just muting this and just

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:24.050 
I practice just muting this and just
playing<00:04:10.200> rhythms<00:04:10.620> so<00:04:21.919> yeah<00:04:22.919> and<00:04:23.250> now<00:04:23.610> try<00:04:23.880> I

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
playing rhythms so yeah and now try I

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.370 
playing rhythms so yeah and now try I
practice<00:04:24.419> all<00:04:24.509> different<00:04:24.840> kinds<00:04:25.080> of<00:04:25.139> things

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
practice all different kinds of things

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.969 
practice all different kinds of things
and<00:04:25.470> then<00:04:25.590> of<00:04:25.710> course<00:04:25.919> I<00:04:26.220> will<00:04:26.580> practice

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 
and then of course I will practice

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:31.189 
and then of course I will practice
improvising<00:04:29.660> which<00:04:30.660> was<00:04:30.870> what<00:04:31.169> I

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
improvising which was what I

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:33.800 
improvising which was what I
demonstrated<00:04:31.410> earlier<00:04:31.949> and<00:04:32.759> then<00:04:33.539> I<00:04:33.630> try

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
demonstrated earlier and then I try

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.300 
demonstrated earlier and then I try
putting<00:04:34.080> it<00:04:34.199> all<00:04:34.320> together<00:04:34.470> you<00:04:34.860> know<00:04:34.979> at<00:04:35.160> the

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
putting it all together you know at the

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.430 
putting it all together you know at the
end<00:04:35.460> with<00:04:35.669> the<00:04:35.729> improvisation<00:04:36.509> so<00:04:36.720> if<00:04:37.259> I'm

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
end with the improvisation so if I'm

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.430 
end with the improvisation so if I'm
gonna<00:04:37.650> practice<00:04:37.889> my<00:04:38.630> my<00:04:39.630> right<00:04:39.870> hand<00:04:40.139> with

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
gonna practice my my right hand with

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.680 
gonna practice my my right hand with
this

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
this

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.300 
this
then<00:04:42.690> maybe<00:04:42.870> I'll<00:04:43.080> incorporate<00:04:43.680> you<00:04:44.280> know

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
then maybe I'll incorporate you know

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:59.370 
then maybe I'll incorporate you know
some<00:04:44.639> some<00:04:45.090> chords<00:04:45.479> and<00:04:45.570> stuff

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.630 

so<00:05:00.380> that's<00:05:00.560> really<00:05:00.770> just<00:05:00.890> the<00:05:01.190> right<00:05:01.370> hand

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640 
so that's really just the right hand

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.370 
so that's really just the right hand
going<00:05:01.850> you<00:05:02.120> know<00:05:02.270> there's<00:05:02.540> not<00:05:02.660> much<00:05:02.900> going<00:05:03.260> on

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
going you know there's not much going on

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.980 
going you know there's not much going on
on<00:05:03.440> the<00:05:03.650> left<00:05:03.800> hand<00:05:04.070> I<00:05:04.220> mean<00:05:04.400> you<00:05:04.460> know<00:05:05.420> you

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
on the left hand I mean you know you

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.570 
on the left hand I mean you know you
know<00:05:06.050> what<00:05:06.200> I<00:05:06.230> mean<00:05:06.470> that's<00:05:06.590> not<00:05:06.770> that<00:05:07.040> much

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
know what I mean that's not that much

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.160 
know what I mean that's not that much
going<00:05:07.850> on<00:05:08.090> it's<00:05:08.570> more<00:05:08.810> than<00:05:08.900> the<00:05:08.990> right<00:05:09.110> hand

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.170 
going on it's more than the right hand

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:10.570 
going on it's more than the right hand
and<00:05:09.470> then<00:05:09.560> when<00:05:09.710> I<00:05:09.740> want<00:05:09.890> to<00:05:10.010> practice<00:05:10.340> stuff

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
and then when I want to practice stuff

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:11.980 
and then when I want to practice stuff
that<00:05:10.730> has<00:05:10.910> to<00:05:10.940> do<00:05:11.120> with<00:05:11.180> my<00:05:11.330> left<00:05:11.480> hand<00:05:11.600> I<00:05:11.780> just

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
that has to do with my left hand I just

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:26.860 
that has to do with my left hand I just
I<00:05:12.140> just<00:05:12.440> work<00:05:12.620> it<00:05:12.770> more<00:05:22.420> you<00:05:23.420> know<00:05:25.750> and<00:05:26.750> that

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
I just work it more you know and that

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.570 
I just work it more you know and that
practice<00:05:26.990> legato<00:05:27.530> and<00:05:27.950> practice<00:05:28.280> all<00:05:28.400> that

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
practice legato and practice all that

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.460 
practice legato and practice all that
kind<00:05:28.760> of<00:05:28.850> stuff<00:05:28.970> you<00:05:29.120> know<00:05:29.270> so<00:05:29.570> it's<00:05:30.140> really<00:05:30.350> a

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
kind of stuff you know so it's really a

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.380 
kind of stuff you know so it's really a
wide<00:05:30.770> array<00:05:31.070> and<00:05:31.280> and<00:05:31.460> it<00:05:31.670> was<00:05:31.880> it's<00:05:32.180> it's

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:32.390 
wide array and and it was it's it's

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.030 
wide array and and it was it's it's
really<00:05:32.720> born<00:05:32.930> out<00:05:33.050> of<00:05:33.080> necessity<00:05:33.290> what<00:05:34.010> I

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:34.040 
really born out of necessity what I

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.480 
really born out of necessity what I
practice<00:05:34.550> is<00:05:34.760> it's<00:05:35.540> from<00:05:35.900> necessity<00:05:36.170> I<00:05:36.440> mean<00:05:37.250> I

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
practice is it's from necessity I mean I

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.400 
practice is it's from necessity I mean I
used<00:05:38.030> to<00:05:38.090> practice<00:05:38.270> blindly<00:05:38.840> you<00:05:38.990> know<00:05:39.110> people

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
used to practice blindly you know people

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.230 
used to practice blindly you know people
say<00:05:39.560> practice<00:05:39.980> scales<00:05:40.250> so<00:05:40.460> I<00:05:40.490> practice<00:05:41.000> scales

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
say practice scales so I practice scales

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.720 
say practice scales so I practice scales
people<00:05:42.020> say<00:05:42.260> practice<00:05:43.190> with<00:05:43.460> a<00:05:43.490> metronome

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:43.730 
people say practice with a metronome

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.730 
people say practice with a metronome
metronome<00:05:44.540> so<00:05:44.720> I<00:05:44.750> practice<00:05:45.230> of<00:05:45.350> a<00:05:45.440> metronome

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
metronome so I practice of a metronome

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.610 
metronome so I practice of a metronome
you<00:05:46.010> know<00:05:46.130> but<00:05:46.850> right<00:05:47.090> now<00:05:47.270> I<00:05:47.300> mean<00:05:47.600> I<00:05:47.840> think

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
you know but right now I mean I think

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.300 
you know but right now I mean I think
it's<00:05:48.740> way<00:05:48.980> more<00:05:49.010> effective<00:05:49.400> to<00:05:49.960> practice<00:05:50.960> to

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
it's way more effective to practice to

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.490 
it's way more effective to practice to
what<00:05:52.310> you<00:05:52.460> need<00:05:52.670> you<00:05:53.030> know<00:05:53.260> based<00:05:54.260> off<00:05:54.470> of

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
what you need you know based off of

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.670 
what you need you know based off of
necessity<00:05:55.190> when<00:05:55.580> you<00:05:56.020> when<00:05:57.020> I<00:05:57.140> when<00:05:57.470> I<00:05:57.500> have<00:05:57.650> a

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
necessity when you when I when I have a

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.950 
necessity when you when I when I have a
show<00:05:57.980> you<00:05:58.190> know<00:05:58.310> I<00:05:58.340> I'll<00:05:58.940> practice<00:05:59.300> my<00:05:59.330> set<00:05:59.750> you

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
show you know I I'll practice my set you

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.830 
show you know I I'll practice my set you
know<00:06:00.080> I<00:06:00.290> practice<00:06:01.150> talking<00:06:02.150> in<00:06:02.360> a<00:06:02.390> stage<00:06:02.690> I'll

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:02.840 
know I practice talking in a stage I'll

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.610 
know I practice talking in a stage I'll
practice<00:06:03.020> stage<00:06:03.470> movement<00:06:03.860> you<00:06:04.220> know<00:06:04.340> and<00:06:04.550> um

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
practice stage movement you know and um

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.200 
practice stage movement you know and um
you<00:06:06.620> know<00:06:06.650> think<00:06:07.400> about<00:06:07.490> what<00:06:07.850> you<00:06:07.970> want<00:06:08.150> to

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:08.210 
you know think about what you want to

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.170 
you know think about what you want to
achieve<00:06:08.330> first<00:06:08.960> before<00:06:09.470> you<00:06:09.950> practice<00:06:10.730> you

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180 
achieve first before you practice you

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.120 
achieve first before you practice you
know<00:06:11.270> know<00:06:11.510> what<00:06:11.660> you<00:06:11.720> want<00:06:11.960> to<00:06:12.020> get<00:06:12.170> at<00:06:12.380> if<00:06:12.860> I

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.130 
know know what you want to get at if I

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.340 
know know what you want to get at if I
know<00:06:13.190> I<00:06:13.640> want<00:06:14.000> to<00:06:14.150> get<00:06:14.720> at<00:06:14.930> playing<00:06:15.200> legato

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:15.350 
know I want to get at playing legato

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:16.960 
know I want to get at playing legato
really<00:06:15.980> really<00:06:16.250> well<00:06:16.400> because<00:06:16.490> I<00:06:16.670> just<00:06:16.850> like

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:16.970 
really really well because I just like

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:18.520 
really really well because I just like
the<00:06:17.150> sound<00:06:17.360> of<00:06:17.600> it<00:06:17.750> because<00:06:18.290> I<00:06:18.350> like<00:06:18.500> the

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:18.530 
the sound of it because I like the

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.180 
the sound of it because I like the
smoothness<00:06:19.270> then<00:06:20.270> then<00:06:21.260> practice<00:06:21.710> before

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.190 
smoothness then then practice before

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:26.020 
smoothness then then practice before
that<00:06:22.400> you<00:06:23.030> know<00:06:23.180> I<00:06:23.330> mean<00:06:24.040> don't<00:06:25.040> don't<00:06:25.670> go
