00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:07.170
 hey people today i'll show you new ones 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.210
 hairstyle or possibilities what you morning 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.769
 can do with your h if you like that 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.719
 I rather lazy side and the one at 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.920
 These are just a little bit asleep 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.920
 hairstyle perfect for you 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.760
 We start with the first hairstyle and 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.860
 that's what I share on my two 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.410
 First of all a big party 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.850
 They fled and just fled them completely 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.980
 normal down that can measure so 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.990
 Be as possible he should go quickly 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.150
 We do that on both sides and 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.150
 then just with little hooks stuck 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.280
 Now we take all the hair back 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.010
 and also the two braided ones 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.660
 streaks still take us in the middle 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:00.100
 a lot of hair is about the same 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.510
 Big is like one of the two bells and 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.379
 Just start with these three 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.379
 to intertwine with each other 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.150
 and then we'll find that too 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.790
 a hook 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.710
 the first is pretty simple hairstyle 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.910
 so that already finished and with this reason 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.360
 Hairstyle is now on the second as well 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.800
 Person directly further and there we divide 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.390
 All of us hair in two big ones 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.790
 sections and start with them 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.110
 So combine together knotted 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.980
 just your hair I have it 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.980
 now done here three times 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.500
 and just have the rest in the top 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:42.610
 Put in the ball and do the whole thing 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.610
 so that bobby pins tight 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.759
 and already the time would be the hairstyle 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.189
 finished in my opinion totally 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.490
 looks smart though it is super fast 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.049
 was done and then it continues with 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.390
 the third hairstyle also super 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.460
 quickly go take the again 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.899
 Starting the election at the beginning 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.060
 and then all of us take one hair 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.439
 page and next has to make his hobby 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.630
 that about one third of the hair 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.099
 from above , then create one at the top 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.410
 hole where we then the lower hair 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.400
 we can do the same 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.819
 us a few more inches 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.130
 below and you have such a cool 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.910
 hairstyle like in 1001 night I find her 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.910
 really cool 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.080
 now a variation to the hairstyle is 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.420
 just the upper hair gum in it too 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.870
 just let the bottom out 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.580
 to let 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.340
 I have the hair here again 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.910
 shot through the hole and a bit 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.530
 relaxed and that would be the 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.130
 Variation of the third hairstyle too 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.130
 finished again 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.150
 Let's continue with hairstyles at 4 o'clock 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.390
 and we take this super easy too 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.650
 All of our hair is just behind us 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.090
 but make a ponytail together 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.310
 no ponytail and twirl it 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.780
 just a little bit put that 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.489
 up and take us a clasp the 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.140
 I now have primark and hair 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.700
 are then just put over it and 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.290
 I think that's super cute 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.510
 and for that one should have one now 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.310
 a little something to give that something 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.220
 see if we still hair somewhere 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.150
 you have and you just use a should 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.130
 I have now also one of 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.970
 primark with a few flowers on it 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.580
 and I think that just looks great 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.050
 sweet out yet beautiful spring it 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.220
 could already fit now 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.640
 you also have the hair from the 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.980
 face 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:24.630
 So I still like the hairstyle number 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.760
 5 and just lay all the hair 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.260
 one side and take us up one 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.540
 streak and start this normal 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.920
 to weave 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.930
 after about 45 times now 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.790
 braided take us from the 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.330
 the remaining hairs still each one 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.819
 with every strand we add 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.340
 surfaces so take one then take 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:47.130
 another streak from behind 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.630
 Add to the braids and then 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.000
 another one so we again about 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:54.060
 have three equal standing with the 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.079
 We can then continue to surface and that 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.980
 I just braid that normally 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:04:00.750
 continue again as much as five times until we 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.950
 then again from the sides to each 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.430
 single strands a few hairs 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.430
 take 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.670
 We'll do that down to the bottom 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.310
 we have all intertwined and hair 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.410
 then maybe as normal and 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.880
 do that with a hdmi, too 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.010
 Hairstyle makes me cool because of you 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.880
 just is fast and a little bit 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.520
 Extravagant looks like a whole 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.160
 normal bad from now you go to 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.860
 hairstyle number 6 and there it is easy 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.510
 continue with this hairstyle and lay 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.030
 we just go around the back of the head 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.490
 and start on the other side 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.440
 messie when so so one 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.510
 chaotic and then do it there 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.710
 bobby pins stuck then all the hair still 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.180
 loose hang down next to us too 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.300
 Just go with them into the dead 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.860
 with plans and also generally when 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.910
 the hair still down loosely lie the 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.919
 you can also just go upstairs 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.810
 and pinned and the cool at the 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.250
 Hairstyle is just that it looks like 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.780
 we would have a lot of trouble behind 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.330
 with the braids given it is 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.639
 just this area next to us 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.500
 put us up and we did 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:06.300
 did not have to work behind head 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.300
 that's such a little trick 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.910
 Let's continue with hairstyle number 7 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.380
 and I just had to do the messi track 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.610
 to bring in that is actually that 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.590
 easiest thing you can do 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.509
 namely all hair up to use 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.750
 a direction and then turn it into 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:27.419
 a bang with bobby pins stuck and 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.620
 you're good at doing if you really are 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:30.720
 no time is that the earliest 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.740
 you can do it within 20 seconds 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.270
 can make 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.560
 and then if it's really fast 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.509
 you should go to point number eight 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.800
 simply a cap is a lifesaver 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:40.599
 the here of a flea market but 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:45.160
 Any kind of use is really there 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:46.870
 a little lifesaver and you are 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.699
 we at hairstyle number 9 and for sharing 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.160
 We get the complete hair in two 

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:54.400
 sections and then catch on 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:56.110
 twirling from the front down here she turns 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:00.160
 So just outside 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:01.860
 so we on the side of this 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.060
 Twirled effect to the rear 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.650
 and to the place are the two us 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.630
 They back together and develop them 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:10.479
 also to find a little there on 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:12.699
 behind the head and make it with bdp ins 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:13.750
 stuck by the twelfth at the side 

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:15.819
 It looks a bit more elaborate 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.349
 as just a message 

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:19.090
 Also, if you have one, for example 

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:20.729
 have flower or other h decoration 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.199
 you can now also super insert 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:24.669
 India there and the whole thing already 

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:26.940
 a bit of spring and summer after 

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:26.940
 out 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.520
 and if you take really much too late 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.780
 it's tune then it does not matter there 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.010
 you do not necessarily have anything with his 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.930
 make hair but can easily with 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.460
 his network pulls out 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.840
 but you can still do it here 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.460
 another fusion video come where 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.560
 I give you my three favorite everyday 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.390
 show person and in addition to a video 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.280
 we tutor the perfect waves 

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:48.410
 Incidentally, this also works in this 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.210
 video've worn and yes thank you 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:52.660
 is less working and until the next 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.660
 Video
