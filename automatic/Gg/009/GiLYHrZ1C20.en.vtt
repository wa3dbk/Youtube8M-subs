00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
done and just wrap them up like this

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.790 
done and just wrap them up like this
and<00:01:51.940> then<00:01:52.479> I'll<00:01:52.659> throw<00:01:52.900> it<00:01:53.080> on<00:01:53.260> this<00:01:53.409> cookie

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
and then I'll throw it on this cookie

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.340 
and then I'll throw it on this cookie
sheet<00:01:54.070> and<00:01:54.340> I<00:01:54.970> preheat<00:01:55.690> the<00:01:55.900> oven<00:01:55.930> to<00:01:56.590> 375<00:01:57.090> and

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
and so I'm going to I'm going to do

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.979 
and so I'm going to I'm going to do
three<00:02:56.549> groups<00:02:57.549> of<00:02:57.700> asparagus<00:02:58.150> like<00:02:58.480> this<00:02:58.720> and

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
three groups of asparagus like this and

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.220 
three groups of asparagus like this and
then<00:02:59.500> as<00:02:59.680> soon<00:02:59.890> as<00:03:00.100> I<00:03:00.370> cut<00:03:01.269> them<00:03:01.450> what<00:03:01.750> I<00:03:01.780> do<00:03:01.900> is

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
then as soon as I cut them what I do is

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.130 
then as soon as I cut them what I do is
I<00:03:02.260> actually<00:03:02.500> add<00:03:03.010> a<00:03:03.310> big<00:03:03.880> big<00:03:04.540> scoop<00:03:04.900> of

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
I actually add a big big scoop of

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.690 
I actually add a big big scoop of
coconut<00:03:06.040> oil<00:03:06.160> so<00:03:07.500> I'll<00:03:08.500> put<00:03:08.739> coconut<00:03:09.190> oil<00:03:09.400> on

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
coconut oil so I'll put coconut oil on

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.060 
coconut oil so I'll put coconut oil on
the<00:03:10.120> top<00:03:10.360> and<00:03:11.670> I'll<00:03:12.670> let<00:03:12.850> it<00:03:12.970> melt<00:03:13.360> in<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:14.440> pan

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
the top and I'll let it melt in the pan

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.610 
the top and I'll let it melt in the pan
okay<00:03:15.459> so<00:03:16.329> put<00:03:16.540> coconut<00:03:16.750> oil<00:03:16.959> just<00:03:17.049> like<00:03:17.350> that

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
okay so put coconut oil just like that

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.819 
okay so put coconut oil just like that
and<00:03:17.890> then<00:03:18.370> I'll<00:03:18.640> take<00:03:18.850> sea<00:03:19.180> salt<00:03:19.540> and<00:03:19.840> I'll<00:03:20.560> put

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
and then I'll take sea salt and I'll put

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:23.100 
and then I'll take sea salt and I'll put
a<00:03:20.860> little<00:03:21.130> bit<00:03:21.310> of<00:03:21.459> sea<00:03:21.670> salt<00:03:21.700> over<00:03:22.239> like<00:03:22.840> that

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
a little bit of sea salt over like that

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.940 
a little bit of sea salt over like that
and<00:03:23.410> then<00:03:23.860> I'll<00:03:23.950> just<00:03:24.130> grill<00:03:24.519> it<00:03:24.549> on<00:03:24.820> the<00:03:24.880> stove

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
and then I'll just grill it on the stove

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.560 
and then I'll just grill it on the stove
probably<00:03:26.950> 10<00:03:27.280> to<00:03:27.489> 12<00:03:27.730> minutes<00:03:28.090> you<00:03:28.150> just<00:03:28.360> want

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
probably 10 to 12 minutes you just want

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.780 
probably 10 to 12 minutes you just want
to<00:03:28.630> keep<00:03:28.989> an<00:03:29.140> eye<00:03:29.170> on<00:03:29.440> it<00:03:29.860> sometimes<00:03:30.340> longer

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
to keep an eye on it sometimes longer

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.280 
to keep an eye on it sometimes longer
sometimes<00:03:30.970> you<00:03:31.390> can<00:03:31.510> cook<00:03:31.630> it<00:03:31.750> slower<00:03:32.110> and

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
sometimes you can cook it slower and

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.470 
sometimes you can cook it slower and
longer<00:03:32.680> more<00:03:32.709> like<00:03:32.980> 20<00:03:33.310> minutes<00:03:33.489> to<00:03:34.090> your

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
longer more like 20 minutes to your

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.630

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
I prepared the asparagus but I'm going

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:57.960 
I prepared the asparagus but I'm going
to<00:04:56.440> actually<00:04:56.560> wait<00:04:56.979> to<00:04:57.130> turn<00:04:57.340> that<00:04:57.550> on<00:04:57.760> the

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
to actually wait to turn that on the

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.750 
to actually wait to turn that on the
