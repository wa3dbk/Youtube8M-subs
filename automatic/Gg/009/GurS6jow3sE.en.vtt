00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 you are not taking pictures of today 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.810
 I'll show you why this is a big one 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.810
 error is 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:20.759
 welcome to a new one 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:22.800
 edition by florian herrmann tv jahn 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:23.810
 today a very important topic 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.610
 in my opinion 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.920
 I talk a lot with others 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.960
 photographers also get involved and 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.620
 straight and with the newcomers that is 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.239
 so that then tell me that the 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.400
 have your camera set up that way 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.590
 which records only in jpeg and at all 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.730
 Not 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.800
 so in my opinion is a big one 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.030
 error 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.590
 many justify that so that the 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.410
 Memory cards will be so fast fire 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.960
 and yes then not pictures fit on it 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.780
 I'll say 16 gigabytes after all 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.920
 memory card costs 20 euros so that 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.739
 is not much there you can be quiet 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.320
 buy a few more and then 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.390
 I always recommend around jetpack too 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.559
 Photography was just getting started 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.399
 as you may not always on 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.729
 sit computer but more 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:10.680
 take pictures and then stop immediately 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.840
 the jetpacks because we have files 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.700
 but are always processed again 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.310
 Sharing at the bonnern is then 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.319
 after the night the advantage that you 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.179
 super great can still bring out a lot 

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:23.670
 So if you have not seen the 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:25.800
 I recently took a picture of a car 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.020
 and thereby made several exposures 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.959
 and one of them was for heaven 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.410
 and I'll show you now and you 

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:35.610
 See below, everything is completely black 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.140
 and if that's a jetpack now 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.149
 that would have been photographed at all 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.080
 not to save and I would have too 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:42.660
 just a shot 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.289
 So no chance there at some point 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.899
 auszuholen 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:48.869
 but since I can engrave in the car 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.300
 you even get out of this one file now 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.810
 get the car out again and again 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:57.149
 that's what you see now who you are 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.679
 after the comparison he thinks he never needs 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.160
 it is no longer possible for her to do that 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:01.200
 help 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.509
 I hope that showed you that theirs 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.500
 Photographs should be about these reserves too 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.660
 have clear is the picture quality 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.670
 Of course, not one hundred percent 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.270
 I three-fade the picture again 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.340
 brighten 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.860
 then you can hear noise and so on 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.940
 I would honestly recommend it though 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.220
 should I just clarify what 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.120
 still there 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.920
 there is a reservoir and if you are now 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.780
 a blind to dark has reported or 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.220
 a win to bright the Wednesday no 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.830
 problem then makes it easy 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.480
 in lightroom under construction due 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.010
 you just that and then fits the picture 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.180
 again 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.070
 So you should not have this chance 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.420
 let your pictures escape 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.060
 optimize if you give word 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.160
 I know a lot of people say I want 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.450
 do not sit at the computer 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.150
 You do not have to do that too long 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.860
 There is a very fast way to get there 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.110
 also edit the pictures or with 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.490
 presets work 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.080
 but as I just said as a small tip 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.640
 for the beginner simply take pictures 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.530
 Luggage and most can 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.459
 Cameras could actually be in most 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.370
 can you adjust something 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.990
 that will absorb both and then learn 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.420
 you take that picture and always the opec 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.820
 file and if you later in the 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.110
 Bildbearbeitung wanted to get started then 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.270
 Do you have any of the pictures he has so far 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.800
 always have a role to share 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.140
 also and then you can still do that 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.950
 to play in the image editing and there 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.930
 you just practice 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.490
 I hope you liked this tip 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.320
 If so , we leave a thumb 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.760
 up 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.920
 and if you wanted to see more videos 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.010
 I subscribe to a channel 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.900
 there are always new tips reviews 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.750
 Anything we have if you still 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.010
 ask has to opec whatever then 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.330
 leave a comment 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:36.360
 Until next time
