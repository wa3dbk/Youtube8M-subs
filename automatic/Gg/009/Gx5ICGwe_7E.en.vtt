at<00:03:12.290> a<00:03:12.319> weight<00:03:12.500> disadvantage<00:03:13.069> because<00:03:13.250> he

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
at a weight disadvantage because he

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.110 
at a weight disadvantage because he
walks<00:03:14.269> around<00:03:14.419> and<00:03:14.750> about<00:03:14.930> was<00:03:15.470> he<00:03:15.590> say<00:03:15.769> he's

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
walks around and about was he say he's

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.210

218<00:03:17.120> pounds<00:03:17.359> of<00:03:17.720> solid<00:03:18.079> steel<00:03:18.500> and<00:03:18.829> sex<00:03:19.040> appeal

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
218 pounds of solid steel and sex appeal

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.960 
218 pounds of solid steel and sex appeal
or<00:03:19.669> something<00:03:19.909> like<00:03:20.030> that<00:03:21.669> whereas<00:03:22.669> Forrest

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
or something like that whereas Forrest

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.330 
or something like that whereas Forrest
Griffin<00:03:23.090> walks<00:03:23.419> around<00:03:23.599> at<00:03:23.810> about<00:03:23.989> 240<00:03:24.620> when

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
Griffin walks around at about 240 when

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.719 
Griffin walks around at about 240 when
he's<00:03:25.430> not<00:03:25.579> training<00:03:27.010> so<00:03:28.010> so<00:03:28.370> he's<00:03:28.489> going<00:03:28.579> to<00:03:28.669> be

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:28.729 
he's not training so so he's going to be

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:29.830 
he's not training so so he's going to be
at<00:03:28.790> a<00:03:28.819> disadvantage<00:03:29.000> there<00:03:29.479> but<00:03:29.629> he's<00:03:29.720> going

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
at a disadvantage there but he's going

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.050 
at a disadvantage there but he's going
to<00:03:29.930> have<00:03:30.109> a<00:03:30.139> cardio<00:03:30.620> advantage<00:03:31.400> I<00:03:31.609> think<00:03:31.639> I

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
to have a cardio advantage I think I

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.580 
to have a cardio advantage I think I
mean<00:03:32.239> Forrest<00:03:32.659> Griffin<00:03:32.780> if<00:03:33.079> you<00:03:33.169> look<00:03:33.319> at<00:03:33.470> the

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
mean Forrest Griffin if you look at the

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.439 
mean Forrest Griffin if you look at the
last<00:03:33.949> fight<00:03:34.220> with<00:03:34.400> Tito<00:03:34.699> like<00:03:35.030> I<00:03:35.120> said<00:03:35.180> was

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:35.449 
last fight with Tito like I said was

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:40.449 
last fight with Tito like I said was
gassing<00:03:35.949> and<00:03:37.479> and<00:03:38.479> Sonnen<00:03:39.079> you<00:03:39.769> know<00:03:39.859> is<00:03:39.979> known

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
gassing and and Sonnen you know is known

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.930 
gassing and and Sonnen you know is known
for<00:03:40.639> his<00:03:40.729> cardio<00:03:41.319> so<00:03:42.319> I<00:03:42.349> see<00:03:43.190> that<00:03:43.340> as<00:03:43.489> it<00:03:43.639> as<00:03:43.760> an

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
for his cardio so I see that as it as an

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.689 
for his cardio so I see that as it as an
advantage<00:03:44.449> and<00:03:45.379> then<00:03:45.590> like<00:03:46.099> I<00:03:46.129> said<00:03:46.250> his<00:03:46.489> heart

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:46.699 
advantage and then like I said his heart

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:50.020 
advantage and then like I said his heart
he's<00:03:47.269> got<00:03:47.449> the<00:03:47.540> heart<00:03:47.720> involved<00:03:48.319> in<00:03:48.409> it<00:03:48.760> and<00:03:49.760> so

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
he's got the heart involved in it and so

stoppage Forrest Griffin I don't think

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:01.780

it's<00:04:00.169> going<00:04:00.260> to<00:04:00.319> be<00:04:00.409> able<00:04:00.560> to<00:04:00.859> sprawl<00:04:01.129> out<00:04:01.189> of

Chael Sonnen world-class takedowns he's

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:07.000 
Chael Sonnen world-class takedowns he's
a<00:04:05.599> brawler<00:04:05.989> he's<00:04:06.260> never<00:04:06.439> he's<00:04:06.680> never<00:04:06.829> been

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
a brawler he's never he's never been

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.550 
a brawler he's never he's never been
very<00:04:07.280> technical<00:04:07.729> on<00:04:07.849> his<00:04:07.970> feet<00:04:08.260> Sonnen<00:04:09.260> has

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
very technical on his feet Sonnen has

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.399 
very technical on his feet Sonnen has
refined<00:04:10.040> his<00:04:10.310> his<00:04:10.790> stand<00:04:11.359> up<00:04:11.569> so<00:04:12.079> I<00:04:12.109> think<00:04:12.199> he's

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:12.409 
refined his his stand up so I think he's

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:15.849 
refined his his stand up so I think he's
fine<00:04:12.650> on<00:04:12.949> the<00:04:13.189> feet<00:04:13.370> against<00:04:13.669> Griffin<00:04:14.060> and<00:04:14.859> and

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.570 
overcome that and like I said Chael
Sonnen<00:04:53.240> will<00:04:53.540> get<00:04:53.750> the<00:04:53.990> probably<00:04:54.560> a<00:04:54.620> TKO<00:04:55.100> ref

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580

that's<00:04:58.820> my<00:04:59.000> take<00:04:59.240> on<00:04:59.420> it<00:04:59.480> it's<00:05:00.380> a<00:05:00.410> very

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
that's my take on it it's a very

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.200 
that's my take on it it's a very
interesting<00:05:00.920> matchup<00:05:01.340> and<00:05:01.580> but<00:05:01.850> a<00:05:01.880> good<00:05:02.060> one

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210
