it's<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.539> bottom<00:01:03.930> connector<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:04.949> see<00:01:05.399> where

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
it's the bottom connector so I see where

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.660 
it's the bottom connector so I see where
I<00:01:05.640> move<00:01:05.880> this<00:01:06.119> connector<00:01:06.860> of<00:01:07.860> this<00:01:08.039> connector

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
I move this connector of this connector

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.730 
I move this connector of this connector
get<00:01:09.330> down<00:01:09.539> here<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.899> bottom<00:01:10.140> one<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.679> we

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
get down here to the bottom one and we

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.100 
get down here to the bottom one and we
remove<00:01:11.039> it<00:01:11.250> as<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.300> can<00:01:12.420> see<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:12.990> the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
remove it as you can see this is the

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.279 
remove it as you can see this is the
actual<00:01:13.470> connector<00:01:14.030> we<00:01:15.030> then<00:01:15.240> take<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.509> corvatz

00:01:16.279 --> 00:01:16.289 
actual connector we then take a corvatz

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:19.850 
actual connector we then take a corvatz
module<00:01:16.800> which<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:17.729> this<00:01:18.030> piece<00:01:18.330> here<00:01:18.860> and

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
module which is this piece here and

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.770 
module which is this piece here and
we're<00:01:20.039> gonna<00:01:20.160> slide<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.789> directly<00:01:21.300> in<00:01:21.509> place

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
we're gonna slide that directly in place

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.589 
we're gonna slide that directly in place
so<00:01:22.050> we<00:01:22.140> get<00:01:22.289> a<00:01:22.319> nice<00:01:22.619> good<00:01:22.890> solid<00:01:23.429> click<00:01:23.670> it's

00:01:24.589 --> 00:01:24.599 
so we get a nice good solid click it's

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:27.919 
so we get a nice good solid click it's
it<00:01:24.750> snapped<00:01:25.140> in<00:01:25.440> good<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:25.860> tight<00:01:26.810> then<00:01:27.810> we

00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:27.929 
it snapped in good and tight then we

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:29.930 
it snapped in good and tight then we
take<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.289> axe<00:01:28.380> old<00:01:28.709> Ford<00:01:29.099> harness<00:01:29.580> we're

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
take the axe old Ford harness we're

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.790 
take the axe old Ford harness we're
gonna<00:01:30.060> snap<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.420> now<00:01:30.840> back<00:01:31.080> onto<00:01:31.319> the<00:01:31.590> jet

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
gonna snap that now back onto the jet

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.410 
gonna snap that now back onto the jet
harness<00:01:32.390> get<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.420> nice<00:01:33.660> good<00:01:33.899> solid<00:01:34.140> connection

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
harness get a nice good solid connection

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.820 
harness get a nice good solid connection
