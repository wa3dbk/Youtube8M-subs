very similar design to the macbook air
with<00:00:35.280> one<00:00:35.670> key<00:00:36.059> distinction<00:00:36.510> which<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.649> that

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
with one key distinction which is that

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.139 
with one key distinction which is that
it's<00:00:38.430> made<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.730> plastic<00:00:39.300> right<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.320> then<00:00:41.149> nor

the<00:00:42.300> best<00:00:42.510> build<00:00:42.750> quality<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:44.570> mean<00:00:45.570> it's<00:00:45.930> got<00:00:46.110> a

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
the best build quality I mean it's got a

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.619 
the best build quality I mean it's got a
white<00:00:46.379> base<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:47.129> looks<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.610> bit<00:00:47.760> doesn't<00:00:48.539> look

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
white base it looks a bit doesn't look

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.340 
white base it looks a bit doesn't look
great<00:00:48.780> on<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.200> bottom<00:00:50.090> but<00:00:51.090> with<00:00:51.960> every

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
great on the bottom but with every

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.549 
great on the bottom but with every
caveat<00:00:53.100> over<00:00:53.489> device<00:00:53.820> like<00:00:54.120> this<00:00:54.559> what's

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
caveat over device like this what's

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.790 
caveat over device like this what's
considered<00:00:56.010> price<00:00:56.539> this<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:58.050> quarter<00:00:58.680> of

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
considered price this is a quarter of

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.639 
considered price this is a quarter of
the<00:00:58.980> price<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.520> song<00:00:59.730> like<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.940> macbook<00:01:00.270> air<00:01:01.170> and

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
the price of song like a macbook air and

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.210 
the price of song like a macbook air and
so<00:01:02.660> when<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.809> think<00:01:03.960> always<00:01:04.439> made<00:01:04.650> plastic

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
so when you think always made plastic

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.300 
so when you think always made plastic
well<00:01:06.229> 220<00:01:07.229> pounds<00:01:08.100> right<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.229> you<00:01:10.229> get<00:01:10.530> sort

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
well 220 pounds right and you get sort

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.030 
well 220 pounds right and you get sort
of<00:01:11.430> it's<00:01:11.640> really<00:01:12.210> quite<00:01:12.540> slim<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.380> that's

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
of it's really quite slim it that's

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.420 
of it's really quite slim it that's
quite<00:01:14.549> thicker<00:01:15.450> than<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:15.990> macbook<00:01:16.500> air<00:01:16.710> but<00:01:17.250> you

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
quite thicker than a macbook air but you

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.130 
quite thicker than a macbook air but you
can<00:01:17.580> see<00:01:17.729> has<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.939> very<00:01:18.210> similar<00:01:18.450> tapered

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
can see has a very similar tapered

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.880 
can see has a very similar tapered
design<00:01:19.310> but<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.640> has<00:01:21.119> some<00:01:21.390> advantages<00:01:22.020> first

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890

device like this 220 pounds it's

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.080 
device like this 220 pounds it's
actually<00:01:57.740> quite<00:01:57.860> hard<00:01:58.130> to<00:01:58.250> go<00:01:58.430> wrong<00:01:58.460> because

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
actually quite hard to go wrong because

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.260 
actually quite hard to go wrong because
even<00:02:00.020> if<00:02:00.170> it's<00:02:00.350> not<00:02:00.500> great<00:02:00.799> it's<00:02:01.430> really<00:02:01.549> cheap

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
even if it's not great it's really cheap

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.840

it's<00:02:02.570> cheaper<00:02:02.990> than<00:02:03.020> most<00:02:03.409> phones<00:02:03.850> cheaper

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
it's cheaper than most phones cheaper

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.729 
it's cheaper than most phones cheaper
then<00:02:05.030> I<00:02:05.180> believe<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:05.810> lowest<00:02:06.500> i'll<00:02:06.710> iPad<00:02:07.420> and

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
then I believe the lowest i'll iPad and

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.770 
then I believe the lowest i'll iPad and
it's<00:02:09.739> got<00:02:10.009> an<00:02:10.130> 11<00:02:10.459> inch<00:02:10.789> screen<00:02:11.180> you<00:02:11.390> can<00:02:11.540> see

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.009 
it's got an 11 inch screen you can see
how<00:02:11.959> show<00:02:12.470> you<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:13.630> screen<00:02:14.630> if<00:02:14.840> and<00:02:15.080> it's<00:02:15.890> got

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
how show you the screen if and it's got

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.430 
how show you the screen if and it's got
a<00:02:18.019> nice<00:02:18.530> keyboard<00:02:19.100> I'm<00:02:19.720> keyboard<00:02:20.720> in<00:02:21.230> all

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
a nice keyboard I'm keyboard in all

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.460 
a nice keyboard I'm keyboard in all
honesty<00:02:21.860> is<00:02:21.980> quite<00:02:22.190> weak<00:02:22.400> point<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.930> travel

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
honesty is quite weak point the travel

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.970 
honesty is quite weak point the travel
there's<00:02:24.950> almost<00:02:25.640> no<00:02:26.180> travel<00:02:26.810> you<00:02:27.650> press<00:02:27.950> it

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
there's almost no travel you press it

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.590 
there's almost no travel you press it
and<00:02:28.220> it's<00:02:28.519> done<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:29.780> trackpad<00:02:30.850> again<00:02:31.850> a<00:02:32.120> weak

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
and it's done the trackpad again a weak

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.750 
and it's done the trackpad again a weak
point<00:02:32.870> it's<00:02:33.739> a<00:02:33.830> bit<00:02:34.010> like<00:02:34.040> to<00:02:34.370> make<00:02:34.550> the

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
point it's a bit like to make the

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.150 
point it's a bit like to make the
trackpad<00:02:35.300> where<00:02:35.930> you<00:02:36.080> move<00:02:36.350> around<00:02:36.739> to<00:02:37.069> this

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
trackpad where you move around to this

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.729 
trackpad where you move around to this
