the aircraft that's crashed into the

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.440 
the aircraft that's crashed into the
wall<00:01:18.409> you<00:01:19.409> have<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.650> drop<00:01:19.920> down<00:01:20.250> above<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.939> to

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
wall you have to drop down above it to

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.249 
wall you have to drop down above it to
get<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:21.960> on<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.080> wing<00:01:23.720> but<00:01:24.720> we'll<00:01:24.960> get<00:01:25.110> that

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
get to it on the wing but we'll get that

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.039 
get to it on the wing but we'll get that
to<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.830> second<00:01:26.630> so<00:01:27.630> we're<00:01:27.750> going<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.960> make

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
to that a second so we're going to make

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:34.320 
to that a second so we're going to make
our<00:01:28.110> way<00:01:28.439> through<00:01:28.470> this<00:01:30.890> tunnel

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:44.320 

and<00:01:35.330> we're<00:01:35.630> going<00:01:35.780> to<00:01:35.810> emerge<00:01:36.729> right<00:01:37.729> here

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:50.900 

ok<00:01:46.850> now<00:01:47.850> we're<00:01:47.910> going<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:49.460> make<00:01:50.460> our<00:01:50.670> way<00:01:50.730> down

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 
ok now we're going to make our way down

00:01:50.910 --> 00:02:07.330 
ok now we're going to make our way down
this<00:01:51.390> way

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.910 

oh<00:02:07.399> I<00:02:09.069> can<00:02:10.069> come<00:02:10.220> up<00:02:10.250> that<00:02:10.550> way<00:02:10.670> too<00:02:10.729> but<00:02:11.920> I

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
oh I can come up that way too but I

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.360 
oh I can come up that way too but I
think<00:02:13.190> that<00:02:13.430> is<00:02:13.790> an<00:02:13.910> imperial<00:02:14.450> base<00:02:15.040> yeah<00:02:16.040> it's

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
think that is an imperial base yeah it's

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.790 
think that is an imperial base yeah it's
an<00:02:16.489> imperial<00:02:16.970> base<00:02:17.150> if<00:02:17.840> your<00:02:18.019> Imperial<00:02:18.500> then

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
an imperial base if your Imperial then

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.160 
an imperial base if your Imperial then

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.020 

now<00:04:27.290> the<00:04:27.350> finite<00:04:27.740> is<00:04:27.830> pretty<00:04:28.070> easy<00:04:28.310> it's<00:04:28.820> right

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
now the finite is pretty easy it's right

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.560 
now the finite is pretty easy it's right
over<00:04:29.060> here<00:04:29.240> in<00:04:29.420> this<00:04:29.480> corner<00:04:31.270> if<00:04:32.270> you<00:04:32.420> don't

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
over here in this corner if you don't

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.900 
over here in this corner if you don't
have<00:04:32.750> stealth<00:04:33.140> then<00:04:33.530> you'll<00:04:34.190> have<00:04:34.310> to<00:04:34.520> kind<00:04:34.730> of

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
have stealth then you'll have to kind of

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.610 
have stealth then you'll have to kind of
probably<00:04:35.240> want<00:04:35.630> to<00:04:35.690> get<00:04:35.840> a<00:04:35.870> group<00:04:36.110> to<00:04:36.320> get<00:04:36.470> this

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
probably want to get a group to get this

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:43.980 
probably want to get a group to get this
to<00:04:37.010> get<00:04:37.130> through<00:04:37.340> here

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:51.320
