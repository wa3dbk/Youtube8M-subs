purchases<00:03:26.130> and<00:03:26.340> making<00:03:27.120> cash<00:03:27.480> it's<00:03:28.170> just<00:03:28.590> you

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
purchases and making cash it's just you

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.270 
purchases and making cash it's just you
have<00:03:29.670> to<00:03:29.700> wait<00:03:30.120> so<00:03:30.660> long<00:03:30.690> to<00:03:31.110> get<00:03:31.500> free<00:03:31.920> tokens

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
have to wait so long to get free tokens

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.320 
have to wait so long to get free tokens
and<00:03:33.170> get<00:03:34.170> achievements<00:03:34.350> a<00:03:35.310> few<00:03:36.090> and<00:03:36.270> far

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
and get achievements a few and far

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.330 
and get achievements a few and far
between<00:03:36.510> but<00:03:37.440> if<00:03:37.560> you<00:03:37.680> do<00:03:37.950> get<00:03:38.220> achievements

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
between but if you do get achievements

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.699 
between but if you do get achievements
you<00:03:38.970> do<00:03:39.270> get<00:03:39.540> crystals<00:03:40.110> and<00:03:40.350> like<00:03:40.500> I<00:03:40.650> said

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
you do get crystals and like I said

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.600 
you do get crystals and like I said
those<00:03:41.459> crystals<00:03:42.320> can<00:03:43.320> revive<00:03:43.890> you<00:03:44.160> if<00:03:44.400> you've

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
those crystals can revive you if you've

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.510 
those crystals can revive you if you've
bumped<00:03:44.970> into<00:03:45.270> an<00:03:45.540> obstacle<00:03:45.990> or<00:03:46.290> being<00:03:46.920> beaten

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
up by the goon but all in all maybe the

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.420 
up by the goon but all in all maybe the
fun<00:03:55.170> factor<00:03:55.620> in<00:03:56.130> this<00:03:56.340> and<00:03:57.060> why<00:03:57.780> is<00:03:57.840> the

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
fun factor in this and why is the

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.690 
fun factor in this and why is the
negative<00:03:59.480> in-app<00:04:00.480> purchases<00:04:01.380> you<00:04:02.040> have<00:04:02.280> to<00:04:02.520> do

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 
doesn't really care what he's doing he

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:31.969
