formed since and once you have the
knowledge<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.190> need<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:45.210> won't<00:00:45.450> get<00:00:45.719> formed

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
knowledge you need you won't get formed

knowledge you need you won't get formed
either<00:00:46.489> first<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.640> basics<00:00:48.120> what<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.930> farming

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
either first the basics what is farming

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.990 
either first the basics what is farming
farming<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.980> when<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.190> player<00:00:50.460> attacks<00:00:50.850> on

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
farming is when a player attacks on

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.850 
farming is when a player attacks on
multiplayer<00:00:51.329> over<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.020> over<00:00:52.140> again<00:00:52.350> once

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
multiplayer over and over again once

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.819 
multiplayer over and over again once
twice<00:00:53.219> or<00:00:53.489> many<00:00:53.730> times<00:00:54.059> every<00:00:54.480> day<00:00:54.590> so<00:00:55.590> why<00:00:55.770> do

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
twice or many times every day so why do

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.130 
twice or many times every day so why do
people<00:00:56.309> farm<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.969> most<00:00:57.210> obvious<00:00:57.360> reason<00:00:57.989> is

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
people farm the most obvious reason is

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.680 
people farm the most obvious reason is
to<00:00:58.379> get<00:00:58.559> your<00:00:58.710> resources<00:00:59.309> but<00:01:00.059> also<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.449> get

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
to get your resources but also to get

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.380 
to get your resources but also to get
hero<00:01:00.960> points<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.890> slow<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.129> down<00:01:02.250> if<00:01:03.149> you

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
hero points and to slow you down if you

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.270 
hero points and to slow you down if you
only<00:01:03.539> put<00:01:03.840> up<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:04.080> few<00:01:04.290> defensive<00:01:04.619> troops<00:01:05.010> each

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
only put up a few defensive troops each

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.520 
only put up a few defensive troops each
time<00:01:05.670> he<00:01:05.729> attacks<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.510> can<00:01:06.930> easily<00:01:07.170> kill

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
time he attacks you you can easily kill

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.530 
time he attacks you you can easily kill
them<00:01:07.680> without<00:01:07.860> using<00:01:08.400> any<00:01:08.549> troops<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.360> get

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
them without using any troops and get

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.840 
them without using any troops and get
experience<00:01:09.930> for<00:01:10.350> his<00:01:10.470> hero<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.010> if<00:01:11.700> your

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
experience for his hero and if your

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
village is close to his you might decide

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.469

two<00:01:20.939> tones<00:01:21.240> will<00:01:21.420> do<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.810> because<00:01:22.680> they<00:01:23.040> are

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
two tones will do this because they are

two tones will do this because they are
so<00:01:23.400> hard<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.729> defend<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.439> really<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.560> best

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
so hard to defend and really the best

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.060 
so hard to defend and really the best

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
to have a look at this graph for how

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.569 
to have a look at this graph for how
fast<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.299> grow<00:01:33.509> in<00:01:33.689> variant<00:01:34.140> as<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.250> can<00:01:35.369> see

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
fast you grow in variant as you can see

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.010 
fast you grow in variant as you can see
for<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.880> first<00:01:36.060> three<00:01:36.329> days<00:01:36.509> in<00:01:36.720> beginners

protection everybody grow at the same

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.060 
protection everybody grow at the same
speed<00:01:39.030> but<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.930> farmer<00:01:40.259> will<00:01:40.350> use<00:01:40.560> this<00:01:40.740> time

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
speed but the farmer will use this time

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.350 
anyways so if you're just going to play
like<00:05:11.849> after<00:05:12.659> school<00:05:12.810> and<00:05:13.169> work<00:05:13.349> then<00:05:14.250> I<00:05:14.580> goals

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
like after school and work then I goals

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.559 
like after school and work then I goals
are<00:05:15.599> definitely<00:05:16.050> the<00:05:16.169> best<00:05:16.319> choice<00:05:16.620> and<00:05:17.569> then

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:18.569 
are definitely the best choice and then

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:20.119 
are definitely the best choice and then
you<00:05:18.659> have<00:05:18.810> the<00:05:18.930> Romans<00:05:19.319> that<00:05:19.590> have<00:05:19.740> somewhere

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:20.129 
you have the Romans that have somewhere

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:23.059 
you have the Romans that have somewhere
in<00:05:20.250> between<00:05:20.629> they<00:05:21.629> have<00:05:21.840> the<00:05:22.080> attack<00:05:22.349> of<00:05:22.620> the

00:05:23.059 --> 00:05:23.069 
in between they have the attack of the

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:26.360 
in between they have the attack of the
two<00:05:24.030> tones<00:05:24.300> and<00:05:24.569> almost<00:05:25.139> the<00:05:25.319> defense<00:05:25.680> of<00:05:25.949> the

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
two tones and almost the defense of the

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.510 
two tones and almost the defense of the
goals<00:05:27.210> but<00:05:27.780> I<00:05:27.810> cost<00:05:28.169> a<00:05:28.319> lot<00:05:28.440> more<00:05:28.500> for<00:05:29.370> each
