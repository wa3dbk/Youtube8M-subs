and it is like the Spirit like breath

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.260 
and it is like the Spirit like breath
and<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:46.380> when<00:01:46.529> you<00:01:46.619> put<00:01:46.859> Aleph<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.759> silent

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
and so when you put Aleph the silent

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.109 
and so when you put Aleph the silent
letter<00:01:48.479> before<00:01:48.829> Genesis<00:01:49.829> 1:1<00:01:50.039> together<00:01:50.909> with

the very first letter of your alphabet

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.519 
the very first letter of your alphabet
what<00:01:53.819> do<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:53.969> have<00:01:54.149> in<00:01:54.299> pictograph<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:55.319> have

00:01:55.519 --> 00:01:55.529 
what do you have in pictograph you have

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:58.219 
what do you have in pictograph you have
the<00:01:55.889> strength<00:01:56.429> of<00:01:56.639> the<00:01:56.969> leader<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.959> house

and<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:59.099> just<00:01:59.369> so<00:01:59.490> happens<00:01:59.880> that<00:02:00.149> Aleph<00:02:00.749> and

00:02:00.949 --> 00:02:00.959 
and it just so happens that Aleph and

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:05.029
