00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:45.000

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.250
 tip penning afternoon to bar and a 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.500
 airport arrival time determined 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.759
 length of stay and depart from can 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.050
 also happen then the flight earlier 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.430
 arrive later 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.870
 certainly because of course quite a bit 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.790
 can be a disruption in this 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.989
 season playing snow and ice 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.880
 not yet but we also go the water 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:22.170
 come and the device can technically fail 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.000
 delays to impact you strike 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.980
 abroad 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.709
 fog is of course one of the know me 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.510
 upset there are 9 and who belonged 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.269
 to leave 518 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.069
 that tithe your 10:10 outstanding this flight 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.180
 further out 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.549
 then I might get this too 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.200
 moving during the day is added 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:42.090
 the because we are here on top of the dome too 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.530
 bald functioning 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.630
 just patted going and I ask 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.049
 the expected IE can be seven 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.180
 things that machine can do on you 22 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.700
 get luca for ten years yes what can I do 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:58.590
 still expect that is a lot 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:01.709
 yes but I expected tine tine the two 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:07.130
 boxes of faucet I have five then walk 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:07.130
 who became behind armies take on wise men 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.580
 maybe a good morning training 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.530
 so no that means you get all the buses 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.220
 so that controls and handles flights 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.830
 directs 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.740
 about 20 to 25 per se of flights 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.750
 nothing is to be handled at the gate 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.830
 so not through the well-known trunk but 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.930
 just stand on platform in the 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.040
 Passengers board the bus then 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.230
 always 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.250
 closed form are the smaller ones 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.570
 airplanes 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.850
 to people also known as the 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.560
 city ​​oppers and those are the flights that 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.390
 really only because of the buses 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.580
 are handled two erase 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.860
 yes understood the rest thank you on twitter 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.400
 or of course in the two that are 18 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.400
 times connection 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:03.349
 he watches bus campus at home around 1:20 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.659
 to kiss 176 extra passengers from 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:08.590
 The hugs and cuddles are frequent 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:11.989
 contact the give opinion because they 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.700
 must sometimes also had a flight to the 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.260
 plan buffer as we call it 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.669
 So the means that that flight also continues 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.470
 means of bus you have to get off 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:20.239
 or boarded 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.009
 and they will first come to us 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.600
 to ask if he have the capacity to 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:25.880
 that flight distances 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:29.360
 for me the challenge is to order so 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:32.930
 don't get in the way of 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.940
 of the hatch I wrote that puzzle of 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.229
 can do it can do it can't do you 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.949
 or a drive or that we have here 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:38.479
 to wait 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:41.090
 and if all goes well and that 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:41.510
 didn't have to finish reality for me 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.910
 to brake 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.650
 and then I did well 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.419
 travel after always maintain flight 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.160
 on the original kate 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.810
 also with screens always the 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.680
 original kate offenders that someone 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.360
 within them 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.740
 nothing else on the boarding card 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.259
 despite that you might have a day with 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.389
 had a disturbance and just tasty 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:01.130
 go on a vacation to on 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:03.320
 the mood by sending it out 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.880
 of a bus by making it as smooth as possible 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.949
 to expire 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.349
 that is the contact what the passenger 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:11.289
 has with the airport and that should be fine 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:13.059
 that we are all there 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:14.529
 have made a nice process out of it 

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:17.550
 everyone together 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:17.550
 yes that's right and Rijkschroeff
