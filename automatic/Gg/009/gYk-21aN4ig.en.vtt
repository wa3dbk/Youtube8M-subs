00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
comes the interesting part I'm gonna

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.550 
comes the interesting part I'm gonna
assume<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.720> guys<00:01:54.869> are<00:01:55.079> probably<00:01:55.380> on

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
assume that you guys are probably on

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.249 
assume that you guys are probably on
Windows<00:01:56.460> 8<00:01:56.729> or<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.000> recent<00:01:57.420> version<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.869> Windows

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
Windows 8 or a recent version of Windows

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.010 
Windows 8 or a recent version of Windows
where<00:01:58.500> they're<00:01:58.770> just<00:01:59.540> way<00:02:00.540> too

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
where they're just way too

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.469 
where they're just way too
protective<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.799> be<00:02:01.920> honest<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.640> basically

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
protective to be honest and basically

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.149 
protective to be honest and basically
the<00:02:03.719> reason<00:02:03.750> your<00:02:04.200> adapters<00:02:04.649> working<00:02:05.070> is

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
the reason your adapters working is

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.399 
the reason your adapters working is
because<00:02:05.460> with<00:02:05.610> Windows<00:02:05.969> 8<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.869> newer

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
because with Windows 8 and newer

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.010 
because with Windows 8 and newer
versions<00:02:07.950> there's<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.700> driver<00:02:09.390> or<00:02:09.629> signature

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
versions there's a driver or signature

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.930 
versions there's a driver or signature
enforcement<00:02:10.709> thing<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.430> doesn't<00:02:11.760> allow

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
enforcement thing that doesn't allow

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.200 
enforcement thing that doesn't allow
like<00:02:12.930> foreign

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
like foreign

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.370 
like foreign
devices<00:02:15.210> to<00:02:15.330> be<00:02:15.360> installed<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.230> work

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
devices to be installed and to work

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.890 
devices to be installed and to work
correctly<00:02:17.060> basically<00:02:18.060> it's<00:02:18.210> a<00:02:18.330> giant

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
correctly basically it's a giant

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.160 
correctly basically it's a giant
block<00:02:19.230> so<00:02:20.270> what<00:02:21.270> you're<00:02:21.390> gonna<00:02:21.480> want<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:21.780> do<00:02:21.960> if
