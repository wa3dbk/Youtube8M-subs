00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.690
 hello very good today in this video 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.939
 we will make another drawing on the subject 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.579
 of Christmas that will consist in drawing 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:22.450
 a candy cane we will start 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:25.090
 making this curve 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:28.980
 so up and we'll draw part of the 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:31.030
 of the candy cane we will make 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.150
 this curve 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:37.090
 this one over here and we'll go over what 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.290
 that we had drawn so straight towards 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.030
 down 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:44.400
 we will divide our curves 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.720
 A) Yes 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.910
 so here 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.690
 we wanted to do it we are way to follow 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.579
 the curve 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.100
 and finally it 's trap 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.510
 once this is done we will draw three 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.380
 balls and we will follow this line and here 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.900
 we will do the first 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:09.310
 we will do another one that will be behind 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.680
 this and another one in this part 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:16.460
 A) Yes 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.460
 now we will draw a sheet here 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.430
 A) Yes 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:30.090
 with this line doing now another one 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.090
 here 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:40.409
 well down with also this line and 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:43.939
 finally another here below 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.939
 we would do so 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.650
 We would return are basically iquitos and 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.220
 just as in the others this line 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.140
 we would do 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.140
 this band here like this 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.480
 around here and we would finish drawing the 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.000
 pretty candy 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:06.900
 we would make this last piece we would end 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.190
 so round shape we would go up and 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:13.040
 we would do some divisions like 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.040
 we had done on the top so 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:21.140
 now we will draw some ties we will do 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:28.300
 one around here following this curve 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:28.300
 we will do like this until here we will do now 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:38.560
 well and here so another one that would be in 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.870
 this area we would do 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.870
 so this curve 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.120
 we will go down 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.030
 we'll come back here and we'll finish by 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.670
 here we will do now 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.390
 well up to this area 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.270
 Y 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.540
 A) Yes 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.980
 we will make some parts so they will hang 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.330
 example we will start here and we would 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.330
 something like that 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:11.900
 and so we would do now 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.900
 at this point well 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.850
 around here and this little piece 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:23.410
 until here we would do another part more 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.410
 I would have backwards 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:28.880
 and it would end here 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.880
 we would go back 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.420
 this part like that and it's the end 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:36.970
 right there 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.819
 and we would have done this drawing of 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.770
 this candy cane I hope that you 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.950
 I liked that it worked 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:48.130
 also easy and simple to do it 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.520
 you and we would see each other in my next 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.520
 videos
