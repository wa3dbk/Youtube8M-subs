00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
fashion shoes that are hard then you are

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.119 
fashion shoes that are hard then you are
literally<00:02:09.450> killing<00:02:09.840> red<00:02:10.170> blood<00:02:10.410> cells<00:02:10.679> every

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
literally killing red blood cells every

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.830

foot<00:02:11.340> strike<00:02:11.640> crushing<00:02:12.180> them<00:02:12.360> so<00:02:12.720> you're

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
foot strike crushing them so you're

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.550 
foot strike crushing them so you're
losing<00:02:12.989> iron

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
losing iron

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.770 
losing iron
that<00:02:13.709> way<00:02:14.000> then<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.030> body<00:02:15.270> has<00:02:15.300> to<00:02:15.450> use<00:02:15.569> more<00:02:15.750> I

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
that way then the body has to use more I

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.180 
that way then the body has to use more I
produced<00:02:16.260> more<00:02:16.349> red<00:02:16.500> blood<00:02:16.530> cells<00:02:16.920> so<00:02:17.069> you

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
produced more red blood cells so you

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.699 
produced more red blood cells so you
foot<00:02:17.580> strike<00:02:17.910> hemolysis<00:02:18.720> foot<00:02:19.080> strike<00:02:19.290> anemia

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
foot strike hemolysis foot strike anemia

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.190 
foot strike hemolysis foot strike anemia
so<00:02:20.280> you<00:02:20.340> get<00:02:21.030> off<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.180> stimulants<00:02:21.630> get<00:02:22.110> off

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
so you get off the stimulants get off

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.350 
so you get off the stimulants get off
any<00:02:22.319> hard<00:02:22.530> song<00:02:22.770> shoes<00:02:23.040> first<00:02:23.370> go<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.209> bed

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
any hard song shoes first go to bed

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.940 
any hard song shoes first go to bed
earlier<00:02:24.750> so<00:02:24.930> your<00:02:25.020> body<00:02:25.170> can<00:02:25.319> absorb<00:02:25.410> more
