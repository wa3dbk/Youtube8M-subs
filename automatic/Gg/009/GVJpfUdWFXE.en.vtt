00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:09.710
I grew up in a house with a younger brother
and a sister, a mom and a dad, and everybody

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.509
seemed to be making things.

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.849
I thought everybody in the world lived that
way.

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:22.330
It wasn't until I got to be an adult that
I realized that this was rather unusual because

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.710
my mother and my dad had other jobs to do.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.860
And so they would make things in their spare
time.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:44.969
And they understood that I was interested
in art and so they made a bargain with me.

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.600
They said they would put up a folding table
for me to work on.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:01:00.809
As long as I kept working I could keep my
mess on this table and I wouldn't have to

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.000
clean up every time I wanted to make something.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.980
So I grew up getting art supplies from both
of them.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.820
My dad was a woodworker.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.180
My mom was a seamstress.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:19.460
So I had the most beautiful fabric, wonderful
colors, and a lot of textural things from

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.110
my dad like nails and wire and wood.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:31.590
And so I think I started out doing collage
without even realizing it or knowing how to

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.040
spell the word, in fact.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:47.210
But I realized later on that this was not
your average family.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:54.690
But when I speak to children, I always say,
"If you are interested in art or writing — any

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:02.439
of the creative arts — please find a spot
for yourself where you can leave your supplies

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:12.080
and you can go there when you have an idea,
because if you don't you will waste time finding

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.150
paper, pencil, and other art supplies.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:23.000
By the time you get to do it your idea probably
will vanish."

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.680
I furthered this idea in the book called Hands.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.450
And so that book really is about me growing
up in a creative family.
