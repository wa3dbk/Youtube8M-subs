00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 hey people welcome to a new one 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.279
 video here on my channel 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.350
 you see the barry is back with me 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.230
 and we are back outside for you 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.940
 take some pictures and I have here 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.380
 two videos are ready to explain how that works 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.299
 with the photograph of himself 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.340
 moving objects works 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.210
 berg has always been very energetic 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.460
 stood by the side 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:26.430
 Thanks for that and today it's about one 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:29.640
 theme what kinda yes I want 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.230
 times say neglected is often because 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.809
 you always think when you move objects 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.820
 you have to photograph continuously 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.149
 autofocus use that I have in the 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.050
 mentioned first video tells how that 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.570
 whole works 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.840
 but today we want moving objects 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.079
 take pictures without the continuous 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.850
 autofocus and we just use it 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.890
 the normal form is me too 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.320
 use when we do portraits with 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.149
 Focus on the eye after that is the 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.190
 Focusing logged in exactly 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.829
 was used and how to do it then 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.300
 finally beautiful photos and above all 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.860
 things are moving photos 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.519
 can do objects and still 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.260
 are sharp 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.260
 I'll explain that to you after the intro 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.500
 is the barry prepare de look forward 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.520
 back here today 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.170
 today would, as I said to you about 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.670
 Talk about how to do it with the normal ones 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.320
 can do single focus 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.600
 this is actually not that hard 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.160
 and is actually relatively simple 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.370
 but still requires a bit 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.900
 exercise as the idea behind it 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.670
 that we have the camera settings like that 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.740
 can we really familiar it 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.090
 with moving objects 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.280
 that means we have a short one 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.780
 exposure time i have the iso relatively 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.310
 high so I use this exposure time 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.480
 can reach here today 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.490
 I have about 1600 dazzling 56 and how 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.970
 not said the continuous 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.730
 autofocus but the normal autofocus 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.920
 So the one point autofocus but have 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.720
 anyway the camera like me in the second 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.270
 video for moving photography or 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.120
 moved a photograph to moving 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.310
 had declared objects, the camera on the 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.540
 burst mode that is called camera 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.660
 makes a trigger 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.010
 56 pictures directly in quick succession 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.620
 so how does the whole thing work ? 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.270
 I chose a position here 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.680
 I do not have an object 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.450
 moves what is in the landscape 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.580
 the mountain will now be after this 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.080
 direction and what I come 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.180
 Now just make me stand up 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.480
 here focus on here 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.640
 the height of this trunk here 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.250
 and if the barry is equal in height 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.739
 this trunk is just beginning to catch 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.390
 I trigger on the burst mode 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.310
 So run 56 pictures 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.780
 in a row and in any picture 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.380
 is the Barry with securing on the height 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.170
 his 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:47.290
 to be the same height as this hate 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.459
 or this stem and exactly in that 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.190
 moment is the picture then finally 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.560
 also sharp and how does that show 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.900
 you like it now in this video 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.600
 So we build everything up and see 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.770
 then right back 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.450
 so I have another one here 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.970
 Lockmittel worried that the same 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.580
 also comes and what we do now is 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.500
 We will be here now 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.360
 Focus this tree trunk with the tree trunk 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.880
 autofocus all over again 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.450
 when we do portraits and I do that 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.880
 has made 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.160
 then i will just do this autofocus 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.630
 store in quotation marks in the 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.480
 I focus on the manual from the car 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.100
 switch focus and I can do that 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.740
 read later without the 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.540
 refocused camera and the joke of 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.550
 The thing is now or what that 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.990
 actually so proven and should be 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.570
 fact that after here 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:36.000
 goes through and exactly when he is on this 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.800
 height here is from this tree trunk then 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.300
 dissolves and then the should 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.150
 sharpness at this point actually exactly 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.310
 I do not fit this moment 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.900
 Somehow I'm missing now 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.910
 here in burst mode that is weak 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.330
 many pictures in a row and catch 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.670
 just before this point with 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.380
 the trigger around then yes 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.950
 hopefully this one point too 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.500
 catch 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.030
 sometimes there is a little bit wrong then is 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.100
 just in the moment where is at the height 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.510
 no image here but if you two 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.600
 has done three times then it actually is 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.520
 always something which fits so I will 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:13.350
 once we 're here yet 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:14.960
 the exposure too bright to know one now 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:19.890
 down a bit 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:21.980
 yes otherwise fit and how memory with 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:26.220
 Here is this focus on this height 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:29.870
 so focus on manual and look 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.870
 Barry comes on the bench 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.590
 Unfortunately, the track knows a bit 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.950
 not the ones I saw before 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.300
 have a 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:47.730
 but now the ball is running so well 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.730
 because he does not want to give me the stick 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:56.340
 people think that's great 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.340
 funny 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.460
 that just did not work because he did 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.700
 just did not run over where I am 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.650
 although it is the focus point 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:12.880
 I just do it again I will still 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.880
 Just a measure here 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:19.660
 that was better but only one 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.660
 try it last time 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.930
 Yes 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:57.580
 th of you that was great again 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.040
 that has done 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.440
 as you can see, it works as well 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:04.570
 in single mode you do not have to go under that 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.520
 continuous mode but what 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:09.250
 important for such a picture is that you 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:11.050
 really have such a fix point you have 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.760
 you can orientate that works 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.350
 also on paving stones yes there you see 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.930
 That's just fine where the sheep is in 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:18.910
 moment is and is really important 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:22.210
 then that you start already zig before 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:24.460
 with the trigger and the above 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.200
 point out, so to speak 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.630
 you just caught this one point 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:31.540
 in the first video to take pictures 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:33.700
 Moving objects is already so free 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:36.940
 I have explained to you like that with 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:38.980
 the autofocus works and in the 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.320
 second video I explained to you how 

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:42.760
 the whole thing works with even burst 

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.420
 mode both videos I link to you 

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.010
 here below 

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.230
 and if your channel is not yet subscribed 

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:49.300
 has would seem important to do just 

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:52.800
 Click on Subscribe and then see 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.800
 something good again next time
