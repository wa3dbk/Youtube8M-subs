00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
the air and they'll actually start going

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.250 
the air and they'll actually start going
down<00:00:31.859> towards<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.340> ground<00:00:33.020> they<00:00:34.020> seem<00:00:34.230> to

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
down towards the ground they seem to

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.310 
down towards the ground they seem to
always<00:00:34.559> kind<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.190> go<00:00:35.340> towards<00:00:35.870> an<00:00:36.870> entrance

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
always kind of go towards an entrance

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.810 
always kind of go towards an entrance
where<00:00:37.500> if<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.680> dig<00:00:37.890> down<00:00:38.100> you'll<00:00:38.370> end<00:00:38.520> up<00:00:38.610> on<00:00:38.790> a

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
where if you dig down you'll end up on a

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.049 
where if you dig down you'll end up on a
spiral<00:00:39.210> staircase<00:00:40.160> so<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.190> don't<00:00:41.520> know<00:00:41.670> if<00:00:41.700> that

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
spiral staircase so I don't know if that

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.450 
spiral staircase so I don't know if that
is<00:00:42.480> always<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.440> case<00:00:43.739> but<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:44.190> couple<00:00:44.399> of

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
is always the case but the couple of

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.670 
is always the case but the couple of
times<00:00:44.610> I've<00:00:44.789> done<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.180> that's<00:00:45.870> always<00:00:46.230> where

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
times I've done it that's always where

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.709 
times I've done it that's always where
it<00:00:46.800> puts<00:00:46.980> me<00:00:47.250> so<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.120> can<00:00:48.239> see<00:00:48.360> they<00:00:48.480> start

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
it puts me so you can see they start

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.630 
it puts me so you can see they start
going<00:00:48.930> down<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.379> just<00:00:49.530> kind<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.800> dig<00:00:50.430> down

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
going down and you just kind of dig down

00:00:50.640 --> 00:01:02.090 
going down and you just kind of dig down
to<00:00:50.700> find<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.210> now<00:01:00.649> so<00:01:01.649> I'm<00:01:01.710> not<00:01:01.829> going<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.010> play

the spawn menu so i'm not sure if that's
the<00:01:49.470> same<00:01:49.710> as<00:01:49.770> some<00:01:50.460> other<00:01:50.610> materials<00:01:51.030> we've

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
the same as some other materials we've

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.730 
the same as some other materials we've
seen<00:01:51.360> or<00:01:51.540> if<00:01:51.630> it's<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.840> new<00:01:52.020> thing<00:01:52.260> for<00:01:52.320> the

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
seen or if it's a new thing for the

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.090

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
under the world in the under doesn't

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.710 
under the world in the under doesn't
really<00:01:56.250> have<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.460> bottom<00:01:56.940> there's<00:01:57.270> kind<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.630> a

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
really have a bottom there's kind of a

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.920 
really have a bottom there's kind of a
floating<00:01:59.030> continent<00:02:00.030> if<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.420> will<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.900> then

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
floating continent if you will and then

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.770 
floating continent if you will and then
the<00:02:01.590> rest<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:01.950> just<00:02:02.010> kind<00:02:02.400> of<00:02:02.520> air<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:03.119> if<00:02:03.690> you

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
the rest is just kind of air and if you

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.900 
the rest is just kind of air and if you
go<00:02:03.900> down<00:02:04.080> you<00:02:04.140> fall<00:02:04.770> out<00:02:04.800> of<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.100> world<00:02:05.369> and

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
go down you fall out of the world and

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.889 
go down you fall out of the world and
die<00:02:08.000> so<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.090> can<00:02:09.209> quickly<00:02:09.360> get<00:02:09.600> swarmed<00:02:09.840> by

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
die so you can quickly get swarmed by

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.120 
die so you can quickly get swarmed by
under<00:02:10.140> min<00:02:10.259> if<00:02:10.350> you're<00:02:10.470> not<00:02:10.560> careful<00:02:10.770> here<00:02:11.100> i

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
under min if you're not careful here i

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.230 
under min if you're not careful here i
have<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.340> brightness<00:02:11.730> turned<00:02:11.880> all<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.090> way

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
have the brightness turned all the way

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.000 
have the brightness turned all the way
up<00:02:12.270> so<00:02:12.480> i<00:02:12.510> can<00:02:12.600> see<00:02:12.870> all<00:02:13.020> of<00:02:13.050> them<00:02:13.260> but<00:02:13.770> with<00:02:13.920> the

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
up so i can see all of them but with the

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.979 
up so i can see all of them but with the
brightness<00:02:14.190> on<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.520> normal<00:02:14.790> setting<00:02:15.030> it's

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
brightness on the normal setting it's

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.540 
brightness on the normal setting it's
really<00:02:16.260> hard<00:02:16.380> to<00:02:16.620> see<00:02:16.800> them<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.220> can<00:02:17.340> kind<00:02:17.459> of

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
really hard to see them you can kind of

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.860 
really hard to see them you can kind of
see<00:02:17.670> their<00:02:17.820> eyes<00:02:17.850> glowing<00:02:18.239> but<00:02:18.480> that's<00:02:18.630> about

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
see their eyes glowing but that's about

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.180 
see their eyes glowing but that's about
it<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:20.540> over<00:02:21.540> here<00:02:21.570> is<00:02:21.780> where<00:02:21.959> i<00:02:21.989> show<00:02:22.200> you<00:02:22.230> the

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
it and over here is where i show you the

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.540 
it and over here is where i show you the
end<00:02:23.660> of<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.750> world<00:02:24.840> i<00:02:25.020> guess<00:02:25.170> you<00:02:25.260> could<00:02:25.380> say

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.880 

and<00:02:29.550> i<00:02:29.640> was<00:02:29.760> curious<00:02:29.790> if<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.330> sword<00:02:30.600> would

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
and i was curious if the sword would

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.920 
and i was curious if the sword would
would<00:02:31.910> transport<00:02:32.910> you<00:02:33.030> back<00:02:33.060> if<00:02:33.510> you<00:02:33.600> used<00:02:33.810> it

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
would transport you back if you used it

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.510 
would transport you back if you used it
again<00:02:34.110> in<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:34.470> end<00:02:34.590> but<00:02:34.800> it<00:02:34.890> just<00:02:35.070> spawns<00:02:35.340> you

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
again in the end but it just spawns you

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.380 
again in the end but it just spawns you
back<00:02:35.700> at<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:35.970> normal<00:02:36.300> spawn<00:02:36.600> of<00:02:36.860> this<00:02:37.860> world

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
back at the normal spawn of this world

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.510 
back at the normal spawn of this world
which<00:02:39.390> brings<00:02:39.630> me<00:02:39.690> on<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:39.870> my<00:02:39.989> next<00:02:40.280> item<00:02:41.280> if

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
which brings me on to my next item if

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.060 
which brings me on to my next item if
you<00:02:42.000> right-click<00:02:42.270> the<00:02:42.540> gold<00:02:42.900> sword<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:43.860> will

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
you right-click the gold sword it will

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.930 
you right-click the gold sword it will
spawn<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.700> dragon<00:02:45.390> now<00:02:46.430> these<00:02:47.430> dragons<00:02:47.850> are

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
spawn a dragon now these dragons are

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.940 
spawn a dragon now these dragons are
pretty<00:02:48.120> awesome<00:02:48.660> but<00:02:49.230> they<00:02:49.410> don't<00:02:49.560> seem<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:49.739> do

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
pretty awesome but they don't seem to do

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.220 
pretty awesome but they don't seem to do
anything<00:02:50.160> yet<00:02:50.700> notch<00:02:51.510> has<00:02:51.720> said<00:02:51.959> that<00:02:52.080> they

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
anything yet notch has said that they

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.880 
anything yet notch has said that they
can't<00:02:52.530> exist<00:02:53.130> in<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.370> real<00:02:53.549> world<00:02:53.820> because

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
can't exist in the real world because

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.530 
can't exist in the real world because
they<00:02:55.890> will<00:02:56.070> destroy<00:02:56.310> stuff<00:02:56.760> I<00:02:56.940> mean<00:02:57.090> you<00:02:57.360> can

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
they will destroy stuff I mean you can

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.880 
they will destroy stuff I mean you can
summon<00:02:57.780> them<00:02:57.959> with<00:02:58.080> this<00:02:58.200> sword<00:02:58.470> but<00:02:58.650> whenever

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
summon them with this sword but whenever

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.680 
summon them with this sword but whenever
when<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.400> dragons<00:02:59.730> are<00:02:59.790> actually<00:03:00.060> released<00:03:00.390> I

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
when the dragons are actually released I

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.210 
when the dragons are actually released I
don't<00:03:01.140> think<00:03:01.290> he's<00:03:01.380> planning<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:01.799> put<00:03:02.010> them<00:03:02.130> in

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
don't think he's planning to put them in

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.320 
don't think he's planning to put them in
the<00:03:02.280> real<00:03:02.400> world<00:03:02.519> because<00:03:02.850> they<00:03:03.000> destroy

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
the real world because they destroy

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.840 
the real world because they destroy
everything<00:03:03.989> so<00:03:04.950> I<00:03:05.010> just<00:03:05.160> spawned<00:03:05.400> a<00:03:05.519> bunch<00:03:05.700> to

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
everything so I just spawned a bunch to

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.930 
everything so I just spawned a bunch to
see<00:03:05.970> what<00:03:06.090> would<00:03:06.180> happen<00:03:06.799> and<00:03:07.799> I<00:03:08.489> try

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
see what would happen and I try

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.240 
see what would happen and I try
attacking<00:03:09.480> them<00:03:09.870> but<00:03:10.079> I<00:03:10.110> just<00:03:10.500> can't<00:03:10.829> seem<00:03:11.100> to

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
attacking them but I just can't seem to

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.270 
attacking them but I just can't seem to
kill<00:03:11.459> any<00:03:11.640> I<00:03:12.540> don't<00:03:13.019> know<00:03:13.200> if<00:03:13.350> they<00:03:13.890> just<00:03:14.100> have

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
kill any I don't know if they just have

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.979 
kill any I don't know if they just have
too<00:03:14.670> much<00:03:14.790> hit<00:03:15.269> points<00:03:15.720> or<00:03:16.519> or<00:03:17.750> what's<00:03:18.750> going

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
too much hit points or or what's going

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.150 
too much hit points or or what's going
on<00:03:19.140> but<00:03:19.320> I<00:03:19.440> wanted<00:03:19.709> to<00:03:19.769> see<00:03:19.890> if<00:03:19.920> they<00:03:20.070> would

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
on but I wanted to see if they would

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.819 
on but I wanted to see if they would
drop<00:03:20.370> something<00:03:20.670> and<00:03:20.940> they<00:03:21.030> just<00:03:21.390> wouldn't<00:03:22.820> so

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
drop something and they just wouldn't so

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:35.060 
drop something and they just wouldn't so
yeah

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.460 

as<00:03:36.070> you<00:03:36.790> can<00:03:36.910> see<00:03:37.060> I<00:03:37.090> tried<00:03:37.450> to<00:03:37.600> hit<00:03:37.690> them<00:03:37.870> for<00:03:38.440> a

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
as you can see I tried to hit them for a

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.490 
as you can see I tried to hit them for a
while<00:03:38.970> I<00:03:39.970> was<00:03:40.750> getting<00:03:40.990> tons<00:03:41.260> of<00:03:41.350> critical

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
while I was getting tons of critical

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.040 
while I was getting tons of critical
hits<00:03:41.830> on<00:03:41.980> a<00:03:42.010> couple<00:03:42.310> of<00:03:42.370> them<00:03:42.490> but<00:03:42.870> they<00:03:43.870> don't

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
hits on a couple of them but they don't

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.960 
hits on a couple of them but they don't
they<00:03:44.500> don't<00:03:44.530> turn<00:03:44.860> on<00:03:45.070> you<00:03:45.160> or<00:03:45.250> anything<00:03:45.280> so<00:03:45.790> I

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
they don't turn on you or anything so I

they don't turn on you or anything so I
don't<00:03:46.030> think<00:03:46.390> their<00:03:46.510> attack<00:03:46.780> is<00:03:47.020> scripted<00:03:47.320> yet

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
don't think their attack is scripted yet

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.710 
don't think their attack is scripted yet
but<00:03:47.770> they<00:03:47.860> move<00:03:48.070> pretty<00:03:48.340> fluid<00:03:48.970> Lee<00:03:49.090> most

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
but they move pretty fluid Lee most

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.960 
but they move pretty fluid Lee most

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
jagged jaggedly I guess for lack of a

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.670 
jagged jaggedly I guess for lack of a
better<00:03:57.580> word<00:03:57.760> and<00:03:58.140> I<00:03:59.140> just<00:03:59.320> couldn't<00:03:59.470> seem<00:03:59.620> to

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
better word and I just couldn't seem to

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.990 
better word and I just couldn't seem to
kill<00:03:59.860> these<00:03:59.950> guys<00:04:00.010> I<00:04:00.250> tried<00:04:00.490> the<00:04:00.610> bow<00:04:00.760> but<00:04:00.940> it

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
kill these guys I tried the bow but it

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.280 
kill these guys I tried the bow but it
was<00:04:01.090> too<00:04:01.210> hard<00:04:01.390> to<00:04:01.480> hit<00:04:01.570> them<00:04:01.750> diamond<00:04:02.140> so<00:04:02.260> I

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
was too hard to hit them diamond so I

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.700 
was too hard to hit them diamond so I
didn't<00:04:02.590> do<00:04:02.650> anything<00:04:02.740> so<00:04:03.160> I<00:04:04.080> decided<00:04:05.080> to<00:04:05.290> go

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:05.710 
didn't do anything so I decided to go

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.180 
didn't do anything so I decided to go
crazy<00:04:06.010> and<00:04:07.260> see<00:04:08.260> what<00:04:08.410> would<00:04:08.500> happen<00:04:08.710> if<00:04:09.040> I

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
crazy and see what would happen if I

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:15.150 
crazy and see what would happen if I
just<00:04:10.080> spawn<00:04:11.080> a<00:04:11.440> buttload<00:04:12.310> of<00:04:12.370> dragons<00:04:13.180> and<00:04:14.160> at
