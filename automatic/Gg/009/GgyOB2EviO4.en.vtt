00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
was actually causing gas and bloating so

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.280 
was actually causing gas and bloating so
I<00:02:23.790> decided<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.480> try<00:02:24.600> to<00:02:24.690> take<00:02:24.870> it<00:02:24.900> out<00:02:25.110> of<00:02:25.140> the
