00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.860
 take your mind off the idea that the 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:08.450
 Bears are loving and affectionate 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.360
 that naughty bear has arrived for 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.400
 playstation3 and xbox 360 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.449
 changing this old idea and demonstrating 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.980
 that stuffed animals also have guts 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:21.050
 basically this game is a big guy 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.300
 theft auto but with stuffed animals 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.100
 principle is very fun but after 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.949
 of a few hours can be a bit 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:30.590
 repetitive the story begins when 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:33.109
 one day our protagonist night fever 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.809
 he wakes up with the surprise that another 

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:38.719
 bear made a party but our friend 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.609
 he was not invited although he does not resist and 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:43.249
 decide with a small gift for 

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:45.350
 this little bear to see this all the 

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:46.850
 other bears start to laugh of naughty 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.729
 bear after 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.429
 furious naughty decides to kill everyone 

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:53.959
 those mocking bears of the town although its 

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:56.280
 anger is increasing thanks to a 

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:59.309
 annoying voice we will hear 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.949
 all the game our mission will be 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.870
 destroy everything in our path and annihilate 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.060
 to all eyes in order that 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.250
 our score increases and you can 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.440
 block millions also counting on 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.570
 secondary missions could prevent that 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.390
 some others escape and with half 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.190
 manipulate us cars and boats 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.430
 In addition we can also go burning 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:23.009
 these same gifts in the game there are 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.270
 a lot of weapons the bad thing is that they all 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.460
 use the same 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.579
 the same damage as for example the 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.009
 axes pistols sticks even 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:35.829
 punching or even putting us in a closet 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.270
 and cause some scares something bad that 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.579
 has this game is that our 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.219
 enemies possess a very intelligence 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:45.009
 low so we can kill them so 

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:47.350
 sadly as we want without this 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.209
 be so difficult but something good that 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.610
 you also have to send them produces a 

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:55.209
 satisfaction that wow because it has a few 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.399
 incredible auctions this game the game 

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:59.890
 introduces you to a child environment with 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:03.130
 airs for an adult with a band very 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.649
 wide for each game mode that has 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.599
 something good that has and very rescatable 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.090
 for four players is a mode 

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:12.010
 cooperative online is pretty 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.160
 pretty good fun and very 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.380
 organized the only bad thing is that he found 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.959
 an available game is extremely 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.940
 difficult that rare to find something that 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.000
 This game is very rescatable 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.599
 this October 10 comes the call 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.599
 panic 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:34.230
 it's an adventure that follows after 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.900
 based game you're basically in a 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.670
 island just killing many teddy bears what 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.980
 what is good is that you are winning 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.500
 money and with it buying new 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.969
 outfits even in the trailer you can 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.219
 see hundreds of superheroes as batman 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:50.189
 you can see attire like freddy 

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:52.560
 krueger and other outfits the sumo of 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:55.319
 I play the best still quite in this dlc 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.079
 the way it looks so much cooler 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.569
 no doubt this naughty bear game with 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:03.090
 all that of the cip is quite promising 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.980
 I recommend it a lot so that 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.160
 play but be careful because you 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.110
 I recommend for you to play with Sunday 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.170
 14 so you can see it from the 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:16.530
 game but really if you want it to 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.930
 play it a week or more is not very high 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.180
 but nothing more once a week and is 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.770
 great advisable since it is a game 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.970
 of play is good his story of 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.070
 developing 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.930
 because all the price that it has now in 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.510
 the bazaar of xbox live and playstation 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.860
 network is quite low so this 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.220
 Recommended game with a rating 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.810
 of 7 I repeat you one more time just for the purpose 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.600
 of the week I hope you liked this 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:44.160
 gamelab recommendation so we 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.160
 we see until the next thanks
