pretend anything I mean is there

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.000 
pretend anything I mean is there
anything<00:05:22.970> that<00:05:23.180> a<00:05:23.390> guy<00:05:23.600> can<00:05:23.810> do<00:05:24.170> to<00:05:24.380> assure<00:05:24.500> a

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
anything that a guy can do to assure a

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.260 
anything that a guy can do to assure a
second<00:05:25.400> date<00:05:27.280> see<00:05:28.280> that's<00:05:28.520> another<00:05:28.700> thing<00:05:29.120> I

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
second date see that's another thing I

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.950 
second date see that's another thing I
really<00:05:29.600> kind<00:05:29.810> of<00:05:29.900> hate<00:05:30.050> second<00:05:30.410> dates<00:05:30.590> but<00:05:31.960> I

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
really kind of hate second dates but I

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.290 
really kind of hate second dates but I
think<00:05:33.830> that's<00:05:34.250> that's<00:05:34.610> probably<00:05:34.850> not<00:05:35.120> a<00:05:35.180> good

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
think that's that's probably not a good

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.190 
think that's that's probably not a good
remark<00:05:35.750> either<00:05:36.110> but<00:05:36.320> I<00:05:36.350> say<00:05:36.650> it<00:05:36.770> anyway<00:05:38.200> to

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
remark either but I say it anyway to

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.500 
remark either but I say it anyway to
assure<00:05:39.620> a<00:05:39.890> second<00:05:40.280> date<00:05:40.930> well<00:05:43.270> no<00:05:44.270> I<00:05:44.300> don't
