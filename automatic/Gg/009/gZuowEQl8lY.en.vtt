00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:05.410
 * cough * recycled crashed among the contributors everything 17 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.510
 how you are and we have good ones 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.969
 with which a cleaning crew ties that means 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.230
 AP you have no w-lan router but only a lan cable infect 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:17.589
 and no Wi-Fi 

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:21.259
 and I want to be clear Magna despite the iPod or iPhone in 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:25.469
 Internet on the iPhone is indeed about the contract and the iPad 

00:00:25.469 --> 00:00:28.630
 Of course not and how he does that I'll show you now 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.640
 First you download the program CCP Roxy Hink in the BI 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.140
 typical attitude and then tipped up here 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.440
 is optical 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.500
 so that they are a window and activate all but the NT service theirs 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.400
 death 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.890
 Oh, then it could close program 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.010
 very important not to minimize x on it 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.850
 next she goes here 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.609
 by 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:56.740
 then up here 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.740
 on systems control 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:02.590
 after that 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.590
 GTI conspicuous looking for you above 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.520
 conversely connections 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.060
 and gets right click on the wireless network connection and there 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.900
 both managed 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.900
 and kickers up here on wireless networks 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.730
 and I've got my set up but of course I'm looking forward to 1 again 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.510
 So he goes to add 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.510
 This is a name for me 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.700
 iPod 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.750
 and Bavaria 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.799
 click here then it was time and the percent 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.810
 not really her 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.990
 can insert network conclusions 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.300
 that's just it 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.380
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.050
 one two Three 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.360
 and it can just say again 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.859
 8 percent only 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:00.859
 one to two quarrel 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.660
 and then very important mission and this is a computer to computer 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.660
 Networks you have to activate Developer Fouquet 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:14.409
 then tipped on rookie here 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.639
 So double click if wireless networks 

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:21.639
 examined 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:25.629
 it varies Teichert 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.329
 and that asked me for the password and then I just have to do that 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:29.069
 password 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.999
 two three four five 

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:34.759
 they look at 1 2 3 and again 

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:40.209
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 o'clock one two three 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:43.899
 connecting 

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:45.859
 he connects here 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:48.369
 in the time it went to the iPod 

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:49.689
 and plan 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:52.689
 go into the settings 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:56.249
 we find WiFi up here 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:59.939
 and that we activate if it should be disabled 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:04.139
 and then percent I find here now only the fixed w-lan extremely 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:06.329
 that's what I imagined him 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.030
 then you can stop here on the PC too, not even now 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.889
 so dozens of ministers 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:15.489
 and I have to pull now however on the PC with the wireless network 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.359
 connect 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:20.590
 converted 7 here met percent network address 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.139
 to 7 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.139
 So that's just the case again 

00:03:25.929 --> 00:03:28.929
 and 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:34.169
 Here I have to enter Manchester 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:41.339
 there 

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:44.029
 DAPD 

00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:47.029
 DAPD 

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:54.159
 Neuenkirchen 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:57.159
 pte 

00:03:57.839 --> 00:04:00.569
 DAPD 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.599
 coquettishly good 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:04.829
 associations 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.049
 so currently offer 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:10.049
 had found iPod or the Crystal Park 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:12.719
 okay i am here now 

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:14.399
 worldwide the 17 

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:17.399
 and I was here on the iPod to celebrate this belief 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.849
 the Cultural Office and you below 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:24.240
 you had to pull your head 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.389
 of course also manually 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:30.540
 and Aachen I see on the PC rounding out the Baltic "those down there 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.439
 do so 

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:36.719
 here below 

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:39.370
 twice bought at Trattnig evening 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.990
 and then up here because 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.999
 and because unresolved then share the address 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.349
 and with me still in the network Attac are above percent refer 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:51.069
 more Alpia address 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:55.900
 I would have on and then there is Policy down here but that was just now 

00:04:55.899 --> 00:04:57.370
 here these 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.719
 and then he enters the head 808 so 8 0 8 

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:03.469
 and that's it 

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:04.719
 then the upper hand 

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:05.630
 Have signs 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.779
 and then that should also work for me 

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:10.479
 I do not know if it works 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:12.510
 because he just got the networker causa 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.270
 but that's how it works 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.270
 we are connected 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:22.180
 Mainz Kad 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.059
 No Klose 

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:25.909
 so 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:29.580
 Made connection and then support the pirouette network and 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.729
 behold the alpine 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:35.729
 Chairman Kurt Cobain here again 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:39.819
 here again on the blue arrow 

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:42.900
 the down 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.580
 server 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.580
 make hotheads again 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.949
 nibble 

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:52.550
 there 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.680
 Soups said Maier 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.680
 Result the Ipro Dresden one 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:02.479
 it says 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:10.999
 and 2 

00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:14.189
 last to do 

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:16.050
 check again 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.619
 and it's all right 

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:21.619
 then it should be here again 

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:27.360
 but that should work 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.210
 So I am still connected 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:30.349
 I'll just come 

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:32.860
 works on Twitter 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.529
 but that can say now because it's just about so that takes a while 

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:38.900
 the left ones did not work 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.199
 It works normally 

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:43.919
 and then we'll have a look 

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:44.810
 it worked 

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:47.550
 so I have internet 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.530
 i can watch all things we came 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.620
 and I can actually really against the settings and then 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.749
 I only have him this Space Hohmann do not dive in the password 

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:58.110
 I only have it my own 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.189
 again nothing 

00:06:59.189 --> 00:07:02.649
 I think I could not have had four more hits and that 

00:07:02.649 --> 00:07:04.770
 in the happy new year 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:05.350
 we separate
