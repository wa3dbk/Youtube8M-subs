 he is going for 80 pages 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:42.149
 but let's move on to minifigures first here 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:46.980
 there are voices tor this is so blue 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:49.520
 monster he i would say he was the most 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:56.300
 He was popular with almost everyone 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:01:00.140
 that he was in many sets of 2 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:05.640
 shallow he too was no less popular 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:14.150
 blue red two most popular we go 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:17.220
 further this rex he was a mechanic with him 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:27.770
 iron plate in the forehead 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:31.610
 and two faces further we go brain well 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:36.920
 who knows at least a little english 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:44.880
 will understand that the brain we have brain operations was 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:46.430
 I also had two of and also in this set 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.899
 there are six stones 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:54.320
 two blue two red and two orange and 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:58.010
 such a catapult for monster 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.380
 not only monsters know and see 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.300
 how does it shoot 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:06.890
 nothing complicated at all just ordinary 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:11.150
 the catapult could have been much farther i 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:18.110
 I do not want so move on to the most important thing 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:20.720
 to our as our car of course the fact that 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:26.930
 attracted it was this huge 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:30.709
 the part that was spinning when set but 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:33.410
 when the car was moving and in advertising 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:40.340
 said that it all moves and 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:42.730
 rushing back to such here it is all 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.860
 was very beautiful in advertising and 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.830
 driving through types all cleaned up gathered 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:52.250
 it is very attractive to be honest here 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:55.670
 me at least but unfortunately at the very 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:59.090
 In fact, it is not so to collect all necessary 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:03.200
 had to drive at a decent speed sometimes 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:05.500
 it just wasn't like differences 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.630
 she get to shaft 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.170
 so it was not as cool as 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.019
 advertising 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:15.769
 but still it does not reduce the slope and 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:24.110
 set of what is here such here 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:27.430
 harpoon and in my opinion one of the coolest 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:34.459
 features of this set is such a bike 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:35.630
 orange bike lego palmoliv well 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:42.340
 box with 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:46.390
 still small crystals 2 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.390
 light green and two blue 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.380
 everyone was very pleased with his big points 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:57.860
 turbines 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:59.160
 and this is how our big to 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.030
 to mine 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:06.270
 crystals if honest because 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:10.950
 just here was such a nozzle and 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:14.160
 all i have at least she often 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.200
 I flew because I didn't play much 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.510
 It was inconvenient therefore put such 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:23.540
 little thing just half the thing 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.540
 from lego technician and it was all ok 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:39.900
 There are two dynamites in this set. 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:43.650
 here and here and how it all wanted 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:50.520

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:07.070
 crystals and see see 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:15.809
 monster can't play and they just 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:20.309
 stuck there well it was very long and 

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:24.319
 not everyone got crystals just here it is 

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:28.189

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:29.429
 mourned much but still he was 

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:34.199
