shredder units the one that deployed and

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.200 
shredder units the one that deployed and
could<00:00:25.019> just<00:00:25.050> do<00:00:25.260> sick<00:00:25.590> AoE<00:00:26.039> damage<00:00:26.210> they

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210

wanted<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.840> be<00:00:27.930> kind<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.260> map<00:00:28.439> control

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
wanted it to be kind of a map control

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.560 
wanted it to be kind of a map control
unit<00:00:29.099> but<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.400> was<00:00:29.490> being<00:00:29.730> used<00:00:29.910> two<00:00:30.179> options

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
unit but it was being used two options

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.020 
unit but it was being used two options
or<00:00:30.689> harass<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.410> in<00:00:32.130> lower<00:00:32.309> leagues<00:00:32.640> the

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
or harass and in lower leagues the

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.700 
or harass and in lower leagues the
harassment<00:00:33.329> was<00:00:33.600> just<00:00:33.809> way<00:00:34.050> too<00:00:34.110> good<00:00:34.500> because

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
harassment was just way too good because

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.860 
harassment was just way too good because
the<00:00:35.070> players<00:00:35.280> just<00:00:35.520> don't<00:00:35.850> keep<00:00:36.059> good<00:00:36.719> track

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
the players just don't keep good track

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.630 
the players just don't keep good track
of<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.230> mini-map<00:00:37.649> so<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.950> shredder<00:00:38.190> has<00:00:38.430> been

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
of the mini-map so the shredder has been

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.990 
of the mini-map so the shredder has been
completely<00:00:39.450> cut<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:41.160> war<00:00:41.340> hound<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:41.790> in

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
completely cut and the war hound is in

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.700 
completely cut and the war hound is in
contention<00:00:42.360> now<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.719> kind<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.170> agree<00:00:43.469> with<00:00:43.500> both

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
contention now I kind of agree with both

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.380 
contention now I kind of agree with both
of<00:00:43.770> these<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.280> think<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.820> shredder<00:00:45.059> was<00:00:45.210> kind

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
of these I think the shredder was kind

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.080 
of these I think the shredder was kind
of<00:00:45.450> clunky<00:00:45.690> unit<00:00:46.140> it's<00:00:46.610> not<00:00:47.610> really<00:00:47.789> going<00:00:47.969> to

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
of clunky unit it's not really going to

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.670 
of clunky unit it's not really going to
be<00:00:48.180> seen<00:00:48.360> in<00:00:48.450> high-level<00:00:48.899> play<00:00:49.110> as<00:00:49.320> map

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
be seen in high-level play as map

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.220 
be seen in high-level play as map
control<00:00:50.100> it's<00:00:50.280> just<00:00:50.430> kind<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.820> nice<00:00:51.239> unit<00:00:51.989> in

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
control it's just kind of a nice unit in

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.500 
control it's just kind of a nice unit in
theory<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.890> war<00:00:53.460> hound<00:00:53.670> is<00:00:53.820> just<00:00:54.000> it's<00:00:54.390> a

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
theory and the war hound is just it's a

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.240 
theory and the war hound is just it's a
Goliath<00:00:54.989> that's<00:00:55.199> really<00:00:55.500> all<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.860> war<00:00:56.039> hound

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
Goliath that's really all the war hound

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.729 
Goliath that's really all the war hound
was<00:00:56.430> I'd<00:00:57.000> really<00:00:57.210> like<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.449> see<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.809> cut<00:00:58.109> its<00:00:58.410> it

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
was I'd really like to see it cut its it

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.619 
was I'd really like to see it cut its it
just<00:00:59.129> didn't<00:00:59.399> feel<00:00:59.579> like<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.850> creative<00:01:00.359> unit

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
just didn't feel like a creative unit

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.139 
just didn't feel like a creative unit
either<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.170> both<00:01:01.859> those<00:01:02.070> units<00:01:02.370> are<00:01:02.520> gone<00:01:02.850> and

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
either so both those units are gone and

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.090 
either so both those units are gone and
they<00:01:03.629> also<00:01:03.780> mentioned<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.320> Thor<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.920> how<00:01:05.040> the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010

just fine the tempest however its role
is<00:01:39.689> kind<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:40.020> changing<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.560> sounds<00:01:40.799> like

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
is kind of changing it sounds like

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.230 
is kind of changing it sounds like
they're<00:01:41.070> going<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.250> make<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.520> into<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.820> siege

they're going to make it into a siege

they're going to make it into a siege

download<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.350> complete<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:49.740> promise<00:01:50.040> it's<00:01:50.189> not

porn<00:01:50.750> but<00:01:51.750> they're<00:01:51.869> looking<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.259> make<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.500> some

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
porn but they're looking to make it some

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.230 
porn but they're looking to make it some
kind<00:01:52.829> of<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.950> siege<00:01:53.159> unit<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.640> also<00:01:54.030> the

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
kind of a siege unit and also the

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.539 
kind of a siege unit and also the
replicator<00:01:54.780> has<00:01:55.049> been<00:01:55.320> removed<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.070> the

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
replicator has been removed and the

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.700 
replicator has been removed and the
reason<00:01:56.820> for<00:01:56.850> this<00:01:57.030> is<00:01:57.090> because<00:01:57.469> it<00:01:58.469> was

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
reason for this is because it was

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.530 
reason for this is because it was
restricting<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.759> units<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.270> other

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
restricting the units that the other

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.420 
restricting the units that the other
races<00:02:00.960> would<00:02:01.110> build<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.619> basically<00:02:01.920> if<00:02:02.189> you're

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
races would build to basically if you're

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.980 
races would build to basically if you're
up<00:02:02.579> against<00:02:02.850> replicators<00:02:03.390> you're<00:02:03.600> not<00:02:03.780> going

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
up against replicators you're not going

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.690 
up against replicators you're not going
to<00:02:04.079> build<00:02:04.229> these<00:02:04.409> tanks<00:02:04.770> or<00:02:05.100> you're<00:02:05.280> not<00:02:05.460> going

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
to build these tanks or you're not going

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.889 
to build these tanks or you're not going
to<00:02:05.759> build<00:02:05.939> vipers<00:02:06.299> or<00:02:06.450> something<00:02:06.750> like<00:02:06.840> that

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
to build vipers or something like that

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.839 
to build vipers or something like that
so<00:02:07.110> I<00:02:07.350> kind<00:02:07.649> of<00:02:07.680> agree<00:02:07.920> with<00:02:08.009> this<00:02:08.099> change<00:02:08.369> it

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
so I kind of agree with this change it

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.630 
so I kind of agree with this change it
was<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.030> really<00:02:09.330> fun<00:02:09.720> unit<00:02:10.170> but<00:02:10.790> they<00:02:11.790> wanted<00:02:12.120> to

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
was a really fun unit but they wanted to

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.760 
was a really fun unit but they wanted to
the<00:02:12.730> games<00:02:12.940> to<00:02:13.240> be<00:02:13.420> more<00:02:14.080> diverse<00:02:14.410> they<00:02:14.620> don't

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
the games to be more diverse they don't

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.860 
the games to be more diverse they don't
want<00:02:14.920> players<00:02:15.130> not<00:02:15.640> build<00:02:16.000> things<00:02:16.210> because<00:02:16.720> of

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
want players not build things because of

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.170 
want players not build things because of
a<00:02:16.959> unit<00:02:17.290> although<00:02:17.740> that<00:02:18.400> kind<00:02:18.610> of<00:02:18.640> exists<00:02:19.030> now

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
a unit although that kind of exists now

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.720 
a unit although that kind of exists now
but<00:02:19.660> i<00:02:19.690> guess<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.290> replicator<00:02:20.740> does<00:02:21.490> not<00:02:21.610> to

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
but i guess the replicator does not to

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.710 
but i guess the replicator does not to
hire<00:02:21.910> extend<00:02:23.550> and<00:02:24.550> third<00:02:24.790> of<00:02:24.850> all<00:02:24.970> is<00:02:25.180> surg

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
hire extend and third of all is surg

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.590 
hire extend and third of all is surg
they<00:02:26.560> say<00:02:26.770> is<00:02:26.830> the<00:02:27.130> most<00:02:27.310> stable<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:28.120> largely

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
they say is the most stable and largely

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.390 
they say is the most stable and largely
unchanged<00:02:29.440> it<00:02:29.860> sounds<00:02:30.100> like<00:02:30.160> they're<00:02:30.310> going

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
unchanged it sounds like they're going

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.949 
unchanged it sounds like they're going
to<00:02:30.490> be<00:02:30.580> keeping<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:31.060> overseer<00:02:31.420> which<00:02:31.600> I<00:02:31.720> like

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
to be keeping the overseer which I like

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.600 
to be keeping the overseer which I like
I<00:02:32.110> think<00:02:32.350> the<00:02:32.470> overseer<00:02:32.890> just<00:02:33.130> hasn't<00:02:33.459> come

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
I think the overseer just hasn't come

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.160 
I think the overseer just hasn't come
into<00:02:33.880> itself<00:02:34.180> they<00:02:34.360> need<00:02:34.510> to<00:02:34.570> find<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:34.959> right

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
into itself they need to find the right

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.690 
into itself they need to find the right
combination<00:02:35.470> of<00:02:35.860> abilities<00:02:35.980> to<00:02:36.430> make<00:02:36.580> the

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
combination of abilities to make the

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.460 
combination of abilities to make the
oversee<00:02:37.030> of<00:02:37.150> work<00:02:37.360> so<00:02:37.870> I'm<00:02:37.990> assuming<00:02:38.110> the

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
oversee of work so I'm assuming the

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.410 
oversee of work so I'm assuming the
overseer<00:02:38.860> will<00:02:39.070> still<00:02:39.310> be<00:02:39.520> the<00:02:39.760> detector<00:02:40.270> and

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
overseer will still be the detector and

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.120 
overseer will still be the detector and
the<00:02:40.780> Viper<00:02:40.989> is<00:02:41.230> now<00:02:41.380> going<00:02:41.590> to<00:02:41.680> be<00:02:41.739> a<00:02:41.830> pure

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
the Viper is now going to be a pure

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.559 
the Viper is now going to be a pure
caster<00:02:42.640> they're<00:02:42.790> getting<00:02:43.120> rid<00:02:43.330> of<00:02:43.360> its

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
caster they're getting rid of its

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.390 
caster they're getting rid of its
detection<00:02:43.989> spell<00:02:44.410> I'm<00:02:44.650> assuming<00:02:45.070> they<00:02:45.190> didn't

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
detection spell I'm assuming they didn't

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.430 
detection spell I'm assuming they didn't
actually<00:02:45.520> say<00:02:46.120> that<00:02:46.150> out<00:02:46.510> right<00:02:46.720> and<00:02:46.930> they're

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
actually say that out right and they're

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.810 
actually say that out right and they're
going<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:47.650> give<00:02:47.770> it<00:02:47.860> a<00:02:47.920> spell<00:02:48.190> where<00:02:48.400> they<00:02:48.580> can

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
going to give it a spell where they can

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.900 
going to give it a spell where they can
actually<00:02:49.030> harvest<00:02:49.750> minerals<00:02:50.290> and<00:02:50.730> use<00:02:51.730> them

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
actually harvest minerals and use them

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.090 
actually harvest minerals and use them
as<00:02:52.030> mana<00:02:52.360> now<00:02:52.959> harvesting<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.530> minerals<00:02:53.860> does

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
as mana now harvesting the minerals does

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.550 
as mana now harvesting the minerals does
take<00:02:54.370> up<00:02:54.489> that<00:02:54.550> mineral<00:02:55.150> that<00:02:55.420> mineral<00:02:55.900> node

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
take up that mineral that mineral node

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.110 
take up that mineral that mineral node
so<00:02:57.100> you<00:02:57.220> don't<00:02:57.370> want<00:02:57.489> to<00:02:57.550> really<00:02:57.700> do<00:02:57.850> it<00:02:57.940> at

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
so you don't want to really do it at

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.820 
so you don't want to really do it at
your<00:02:58.150> own<00:02:58.330> base<00:02:58.630> but<00:02:59.019> that's<00:02:59.350> really<00:02:59.530> cool

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
your own base but that's really cool

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.560 
your own base but that's really cool
it's<00:03:00.010> kind<00:03:00.160> of<00:03:00.190> like<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.459> filer<00:03:00.730> it<00:03:01.150> still<00:03:01.390> has
