with no way just to get the stretch and
then<00:00:28.240> I'll<00:00:28.420> use<00:00:28.689> a<00:00:29.380> 45-pound<00:00:30.220> plate<00:00:30.370> after

then I'll use a 45-pound plate after
that<00:00:31.539> I<00:00:31.570> drop<00:00:31.870> it<00:00:31.990> down<00:00:32.080> to<00:00:32.140> a<00:00:32.290> 25<00:00:32.890> which<00:00:33.129> I

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
that I drop it down to a 25 which I

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.750 
that I drop it down to a 25 which I
didn't<00:00:33.730> record<00:00:34.059> but<00:00:34.620> I'm<00:00:35.620> after<00:00:35.800> the<00:00:35.920> 25<00:00:36.280> I

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
didn't record but I'm after the 25 I

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.780 
didn't record but I'm after the 25 I
went<00:00:37.000> back<00:00:37.180> down<00:00:37.449> to<00:00:37.480> no<00:00:37.870> wait<00:00:38.110> and<00:00:38.410> I<00:00:39.400> do

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
went back down to no wait and I do

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.610 
went back down to no wait and I do
stress<00:00:40.270> the<00:00:40.390> importance<00:00:40.840> of<00:00:40.960> a<00:00:41.050> full<00:00:41.260> range<00:00:41.440> of

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
stress the importance of a full range of

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.410 
stress the importance of a full range of
motion<00:00:41.680> on<00:00:42.070> a<00:00:42.100> pull-up<00:00:42.430> you<00:00:43.030> don't<00:00:43.180> want<00:00:43.300> to<00:00:43.360> be

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
motion on a pull-up you don't want to be

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.660 
motion on a pull-up you don't want to be
wasting<00:00:43.840> your<00:00:43.870> time<00:00:44.140> going<00:00:44.440> half-assed<00:00:45.430> on

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
wasting your time going half-assed on

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.760 
wasting your time going half-assed on
these<00:00:45.880> so<00:00:46.149> notice<00:00:46.540> how<00:00:46.630> i<00:00:46.660> do<00:00:46.840> almost<00:00:47.260> lockout

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:47.770 
these so notice how i do almost lockout

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.860 
these so notice how i do almost lockout
at<00:00:47.920> the<00:00:48.010> bottom<00:00:48.280> of<00:00:48.399> the<00:00:48.460> movement<00:00:48.850> and<00:00:49.030> pull

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
at the bottom of the movement and pull

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.530 
at the bottom of the movement and pull
back<00:00:50.050> up<00:00:50.290> I<00:00:50.880> think<00:00:51.880> this<00:00:52.000> is<00:00:52.120> a<00:00:52.149> great<00:00:52.300> way<00:00:52.390> to

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:52.540 
back up I think this is a great way to

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.020 
back up I think this is a great way to
start<00:00:52.780> back<00:00:53.020> workouts<00:00:53.530> gets<00:00:54.489> a<00:00:54.550> great<00:00:54.760> stretch

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
start back workouts gets a great stretch

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.260 
start back workouts gets a great stretch
in<00:00:55.180> the<00:00:55.300> lats<00:00:55.510> and<00:00:55.809> then<00:00:56.680> I<00:00:56.739> moved<00:00:56.980> on<00:00:57.160> to<00:00:57.399> some

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:58.270 
in the lats and then I moved on to some

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.150 
in the lats and then I moved on to some
seated<00:00:58.840> rows<00:00:59.730> again<00:01:00.730> form<00:01:01.690> is<00:01:01.899> key<00:01:02.170> on<00:01:02.469> I<00:01:02.770> mean

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
seated rows again form is key on I mean

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.100 
seated rows again form is key on I mean
any<00:01:03.309> exercise<00:01:03.850> you<00:01:04.030> do<00:01:04.210> form<00:01:04.570> is<00:01:04.720> going<00:01:04.869> to<00:01:04.930> be

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
any exercise you do form is going to be

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.330 
any exercise you do form is going to be
probably<00:01:06.009> the<00:01:06.100> most<00:01:06.280> important<00:01:06.820> factor<00:01:07.240> but

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
probably the most important factor but

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.499 
probably the most important factor but

row now I'm doing pull downs and you'll
see<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.890> next<00:01:41.100> movement<00:01:41.340> when<00:01:41.580> it<00:01:41.670> comes<00:01:41.820> up

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
see the next movement when it comes up

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.389 
see the next movement when it comes up
again<00:01:42.960> with<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.380> just<00:01:43.740> like<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.009> pull-ups

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
again with this just like the pull-ups

you're looking for a full range of
motion<00:01:46.549> really<00:01:47.549> squeeze<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:48.030> lats<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.960> try

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
motion really squeeze the lats and I try

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:50.899 
motion really squeeze the lats and I try
not<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.500> go<00:01:49.679> too<00:01:49.740> wide<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.580> lot<00:01:50.789> of<00:01:50.820> people

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
not to go too wide and a lot of people

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.149 
not to go too wide and a lot of people
stress<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.630> importance<00:01:52.049> of<00:01:52.170> going<00:01:52.500> they<00:01:52.979> say

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
stress the importance of going they say

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.330 
stress the importance of going they say
the<00:01:53.310> wider<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.789> go<00:01:54.360> wider<00:01:55.110> your<00:01:55.350> back<00:01:55.590> but

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
the wider you go wider your back but

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.859 
the wider you go wider your back but
that<00:01:56.520> doesn't<00:01:56.640> allow<00:01:56.880> for<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.299> full<00:01:57.570> range<00:01:57.689> of

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
that doesn't allow for a full range of

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.340 
that doesn't allow for a full range of
motion<00:01:57.950> also<00:01:58.950> notice<00:01:59.549> with<00:02:00.420> me<00:02:00.690> pulling<00:02:01.020> down

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
motion also notice with me pulling down

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.340 
motion also notice with me pulling down
I<00:02:02.090> don't<00:02:03.090> lean<00:02:03.330> back<00:02:03.600> too<00:02:03.840> far<00:02:03.869> because

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
I don't lean back too far because

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.719 
I don't lean back too far because
otherwise<00:02:04.590> it's<00:02:04.830> headed<00:02:05.069> to<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.220> row<00:02:05.459> type

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
otherwise it's headed to a row type

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.460 
otherwise it's headed to a row type
movement<00:02:06.179> this<00:02:06.270> is<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.479> Latin<00:02:06.929> movement<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:07.380> you

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
movement this is a Latin movement so you

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.600

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
near failure I didn't go to a hundred

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.120 
near failure I didn't go to a hundred
percent<00:02:29.670> failure<00:02:30.209> but<00:02:30.360> I<00:02:30.420> was<00:02:30.540> pretty<00:02:30.750> close

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
I feel like with this kind of weight i

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.060 
I feel like with this kind of weight i
should<00:02:36.329> be<00:02:36.480> using<00:02:36.660> lifting<00:02:37.109> straps<00:02:37.380> obviously

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070

forearms and my grip strength so i'm

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.460

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790
