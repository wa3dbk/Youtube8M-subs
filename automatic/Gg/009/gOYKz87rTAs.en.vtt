00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.619 
right what's the computer can understand
that<00:00:56.219> then<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.820> can<00:00:56.850> feed<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.480> information

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
that then you can feed that information

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.360 
that then you can feed that information
into<00:00:58.699> weapons<00:00:59.699> system<00:01:00.059> or<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.329> wheelchair<00:01:01.020> or
