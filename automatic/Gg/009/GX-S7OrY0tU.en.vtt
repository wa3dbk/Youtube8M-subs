00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:14.039
 do not 

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:25.359
 we are a winery company 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.529
 what is located in castilla-la mancha 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.399
 and I started as jovi 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:34.149
 but always with the clear idea that in the end we have to have a warehouse in the 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:36.530
 that a hobby the risk 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.380
 what many people think 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.370
 ride a volley many wineries I think it's 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.370
 the market fully exploited 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.070
 I think the biggest concern especially with the weather 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.850
 above all there have been harvests that we have touched 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.780
 a frost 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.160
 starting at night is to come here to see it 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.980
 the weather station 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.770
 we had great luck the year 2001 an excellent harvest 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.190
 but excellent 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.470
 then it was our first harvest 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.890
 we were scared to death 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.550
 to see what it says that people think but not the acceptance was 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.130
 we run out of money 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.870
 we have 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.870
 two possibilities of growth, one by activity 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.500
 and another is winter outside 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.720
 one of the things that I remember most fondly was the first export that 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.810
 outside switzerland 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:37.780
 a good friend 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.850
 some contacts with a 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.250
 an acquaintance of him 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.600
 i german diamons the samples quickly 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.189
 and he really liked it a lot since we sent him the samples 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.810
 he tried it on foot days he made us an order 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.190
 I think it was one of the most memorable moments I wanted in my life 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.960
 dugout for us something paste before on bike sing because 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.420
 a product sack from our land lost his daughter to me it seemed 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.569
 that put the guard toledo 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.539
 as a dream I have not made a dream or twitter was already done not 

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:16.539
 but I think he also taught us something that I pique 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:20.209
 It is true that borders or distance is not a 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.039
 an impediment 

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:27.349
 we have never had a complex attitude before, maybe on the contrary I think 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:27.979
 not 

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:30.249
 we went running the the world 

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:34.510
 and with a desire and with a desire to sell and with more desire to fight 

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:38.539
 that we keep 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:42.479
 but what is left is the land where that product comes from 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.289
 that is a personal satisfaction 

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:49.589
 and he also seeing my people happy
