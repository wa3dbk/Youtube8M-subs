00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
I mean so I kind of understand that but

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.060 
I mean so I kind of understand that but
at<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.750> same<00:02:13.960> time<00:02:14.200> if<00:02:14.470> you're<00:02:14.680> going<00:02:14.920> out<00:02:15.040> of

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
at the same time if you're going out of

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.330 
at the same time if you're going out of
your<00:02:15.160> way<00:02:15.340> to<00:02:15.910> try<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:16.210> make<00:02:16.330> videos<00:02:16.810> exactly

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
your way to try and make videos exactly

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.280 
your way to try and make videos exactly
like<00:02:18.340> others<00:02:18.670> or<00:02:18.910> so<00:02:19.300> similar<00:02:19.810> where<00:02:20.020> it's

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
like others or so similar where it's

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.560 
like others or so similar where it's
almost<00:02:20.820> impossible<00:02:21.820> to<00:02:21.880> find<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.240> difference

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
almost impossible to find the difference

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.780 
almost impossible to find the difference
between<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:22.870> two<00:02:23.140> and<00:02:23.530> I<00:02:24.100> think<00:02:24.310> that<00:02:24.430> is<00:02:24.580> kind

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
between the two and I think that is kind

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.030 
between the two and I think that is kind
of<00:02:24.940> cheap<00:02:25.390> and<00:02:25.630> I<00:02:26.080> think<00:02:26.290> that<00:02:26.410> is<00:02:26.530> kind<00:02:26.740> of<00:02:26.800> a

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
of cheap and I think that is kind of a

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.660 
of cheap and I think that is kind of a
bit<00:02:27.850> of<00:02:27.940> a<00:02:28.000> rude<00:02:28.300> tactic<00:02:29.250> that's<00:02:30.250> just<00:02:30.490> my

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
bit of a rude tactic that's just my

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:31.170 
bit of a rude tactic that's just my
opinion

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
opinion

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.640

the<00:06:21.190> people<00:06:21.340> that<00:06:21.900> this<00:06:22.900> guy<00:06:23.110> Ron<00:06:23.350> instinct'

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:23.920 
the people that this guy Ron instinct'

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.610 
the people that this guy Ron instinct'
he<00:06:24.640> really<00:06:24.940> does<00:06:25.180> do<00:06:25.480> some<00:06:25.720> really<00:06:26.500> weird

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:26.620 
he really does do some really weird

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.410 
he really does do some really weird
things<00:06:27.070> and<00:06:27.310> I<00:06:27.400> do<00:06:27.460> not<00:06:27.700> agree<00:06:27.910> with<00:06:28.030> some<00:06:28.330> of

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:28.420 
things and I do not agree with some of

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.420 
things and I do not agree with some of
the<00:06:28.480> taxes<00:06:28.870> that<00:06:28.990> he<00:06:29.080> used<00:06:29.320> to<00:06:29.410> get<00:06:29.680> views<00:06:30.130> and

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.430 
the taxes that he used to get views and

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.010 
the taxes that he used to get views and
I<00:06:30.850> do<00:06:30.910> believe<00:06:31.180> that<00:06:31.390> he<00:06:31.570> steals<00:06:31.840> other

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020 
I do believe that he steals other

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.680 
I do believe that he steals other
people's<00:06:32.140> video<00:06:32.770> ideas<00:06:33.190> and<00:06:33.460> I<00:06:34.120> kind<00:06:34.540> of<00:06:34.570> think

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:34.690 
people's video ideas and I kind of think

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:35.650 
people's video ideas and I kind of think
that's<00:06:34.840> undermining

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:35.660 
that's undermining

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.140 
that's undermining
and<00:06:35.750> kind<00:06:36.080> of<00:06:36.140> cheap<00:06:36.410> tactics<00:06:36.950> but<00:06:37.610> you<00:06:37.820> know<00:06:37.940> I

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:38.150 
and kind of cheap tactics but you know I

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:39.850 
and kind of cheap tactics but you know I
guess<00:06:38.300> he's<00:06:38.450> entitled<00:06:38.750> to<00:06:38.900> his<00:06:39.110> own<00:06:39.230> thing<00:06:39.590> I

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:39.860 
guess he's entitled to his own thing I

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.950 
guess he's entitled to his own thing I
really<00:06:40.430> do<00:06:40.550> think<00:06:40.760> that<00:06:40.880> the<00:06:41.060> guy<00:06:41.210> needs<00:06:41.900> to

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:41.960 
really do think that the guy needs to

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.380 
really do think that the guy needs to
smarten<00:06:42.410> up<00:06:42.530> and<00:06:42.830> you<00:06:43.400> know<00:06:43.490> maybe<00:06:43.760> change<00:06:44.180> his

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:44.390 
smarten up and you know maybe change his

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.300 
smarten up and you know maybe change his
ways<00:06:44.600> but<00:06:44.900> I<00:06:45.140> guess<00:06:45.590> that's<00:06:45.800> just<00:06:45.860> the<00:06:46.070> way<00:06:46.190> it

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:46.310 
ways but I guess that's just the way it

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:47.650 
ways but I guess that's just the way it
