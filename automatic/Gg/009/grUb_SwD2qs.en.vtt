 Well Well have passed since p is about three weeks from buying I Tobidase Animal Crossing say 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.410
 The 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:12.390
 So what kind of feeling is it in the back Namuraga 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:16.270
 I think that I want to do a recent report 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:18.020
 First of all, what can we do? 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.890
 This is it 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.009
 Follow 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:27.670
 This is the feeling of the end topography that I was troubled after all 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:32.680
 This is the current of my room Pikmin Toka 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:36.500
 This dj there I think you also to my actual room guy is Manma 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:40.070
 I feel that Kicha' This is the luck clock 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:43.190
 I'd made in the previous yourself in front of the black eyed peas 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:48.940
 I have no idea but I think I 've done it well 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:50.980
 I made the design of youtuber p so badly before my game 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.790
 10 people hey 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:58.130
 I moved and came 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.130
 I think this little not Ya Guess 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.720
 I make a bench with the corresponding here 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:12.980
 I personally like it, I like it 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.880
 And here in the fountain this is also horror 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:18.299
 Chapter chapter this 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.890
 I always wonder if I want you to feel hot 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.760
 I can't say that because it 's a village 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:28.720
 This can be a dream at Nintendo Village 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.870
 Though it is what came over in Nintendo Village 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:35.910
 It is after a signboard 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:38.520
 So even though it's a better shopping street in little or Let's go towards the shopping district 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:41.119
 It became a convenience store 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.119
 That is 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.810
 It looks like that kind of shank shoes or shoulder head here 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.710
 It is still what 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:58.130
 It is a dreaming house 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:02:01.240
 The club prime minister here has been a signature activity recently, but then 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.750
 There is no movement at all 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:11.560
 Naa nowhere to show what wonder if this much 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:15.400
 So I have never been to other people's village at that Yume No. So how much of my own village

 My design is that Wan'oku whether placard di in which to show the earlier 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:33.110
