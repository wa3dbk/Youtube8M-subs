practically full-time so that's a that's
a<00:01:58.780> big<00:01:58.810> challenge<00:01:59.200> and<00:01:59.619> I<00:02:00.250> certainly<00:02:00.460> they

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
a big challenge and I certainly they

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.850 
a big challenge and I certainly they

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.620 
were small but I think that we one or
two<00:02:02.950> other<00:02:03.070> clubs<00:02:03.310> in<00:02:03.880> seminary<00:02:04.330> at<00:02:04.420> summer

that's<00:02:25.650> that's<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.490> exciting<00:02:26.760> part<00:02:26.910> right

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
that's that's the exciting part right

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.870 
that's that's the exciting part right
now<00:02:27.750> is<00:02:27.810> probably<00:02:28.260> as<00:02:28.950> low<00:02:29.190> as<00:02:29.310> it's<00:02:29.460> gonna<00:02:29.610> go

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
now is probably as low as it's gonna go

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
player that I tracked while he was in

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.660 
player that I tracked while he was in
Scotland<00:03:55.530> a<00:03:55.680> lot<00:03:55.950> of<00:03:56.040> time<00:03:56.189> before<00:03:56.370> I<00:03:56.489> think

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
Scotland a lot of time before I think

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.199 
Scotland a lot of time before I think
he's<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:56.909> right<00:03:57.060> age<00:03:57.889> he's<00:03:58.889> got<00:03:59.819> a<00:03:59.849> year<00:04:00.060> on

this<00:04:00.299> belt<00:04:00.569> as<00:04:00.870> apparently<00:04:01.560> good<00:04:01.680> player<00:04:01.920> I

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 
this belt as apparently good player I

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.800 
this belt as apparently good player I
think<00:04:02.730> it'd<00:04:02.819> be<00:04:02.849> a<00:04:02.939> massive<00:04:03.299> asset<00:04:03.569> to<00:04:03.719> this

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
think it'd be a massive asset to this

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.849 
think it'd be a massive asset to this
