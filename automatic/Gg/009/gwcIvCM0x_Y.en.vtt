 to follow this path that neither the son nor the 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.889
 another video improving then said will 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.859
 be more explaining some concepts to 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.039
 who is initiating there in the art of israel 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.990
 to the head the law and edno crossed the Chinese 10 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.119
 When I was first, I want to thank you. 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.189
 much for the positive feedback you 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.369
 another video that lets you hit 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.980
 mtv many channel telly records 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.590
 preview soon then thank you 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.350
 I apologize for the delay in 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.600
 post this second part but let's go 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.070
 I'll start by talking guys of the types. 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.860
 of actions you do 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.340
 when aiming with the scope of yours at the time 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.890
 with round sights nasa not only arrive 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.980
 late iron also anyway this is fine 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.170
 for all the party is a nomenclature 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.570
 standard will start here because of the risk 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.829
 the excuse when you stand stands 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.600
 with the aim is thus to move or 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.320
 also moving only with the aim 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.030
 Perta your enemy is this is called 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.189
 I 'm sorry, sorry, last week, show. 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.909
 for you the deg with the title that you 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.070
 drag the eyes and the aunt when you go in 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.020
 contact with your album I explain you 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.640
 in pv and the crowd because it is much easier 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.860
 than pvp then this is the dress code is 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.530
 there are also people who carve 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.630
 sorry if you do not drag you seal 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.560
 on your opponent what I'm doing 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:38.100
 now and then you look and shoot focus on him 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.140
 would get you out of the way 6 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.619
 strip is very difficult to do this not 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.049
 resolve 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.960
 we can not not everyone who 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.540
 It's quite complicated and no scoop is when 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.880
 You do not look at you at all. 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.720
 You simply take what you do for your 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.729
 in season 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.070
 good this also something very difficult 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.500
 to be able to make a crucible now 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.909
 People are going to talk about sensitivity. 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.130
 I'll start by showing you the 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.170
 greater sensitivity of the game looks like 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.450
 her as soon as she moves it in the 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.009
 sensitivity 10 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.289
 for those who do not know to change their 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.290
 sensitivity you go there in your menu 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:16.159
 go to settings 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.709
 and then you can change it from one of these 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:20.120
 Now I'll show you, I do not speak. 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.480
 minimum sensitivity 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.700
 Look how much slower it is already. 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.510
 I'll try to move it as fast as I can. 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:32.209
 gets very slow compared to 10 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:36.049
 because you play to play dinap I recommend 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:38.720
 a sensitivity of 3 to 8 maximum 10 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:41.510
 leaves you very inaccurate and leaves 1 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:46.700
 You are very slow so it is recommended that you 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:50.120
 use between 3 and 8 I usually use 66 is 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.769
 my my standard is 8 when the game of 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.930
 no clear land because when in a 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:57.470
 earth beyond as it slows down 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.150
 I need to pull the scope faster. I 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.510
 I started playing guys with a 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.400
 flexibility 3 is after a while I 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.319
 I realized she was slowing me down. 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.819
 bit but found good accessibility 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:11.209
 especially for those who are 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:15.650
 starting I advise starting 3 goes 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:18.049
 increasing goes through three passes 45 until 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.409
 you feel comfortable enough 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:24.190
 with your sensitivity is to go 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:24.190
 increasing 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.959
 I'll also tell the guys about in 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.880
 watch the wizard who is a 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.520
 value that exists in all areas of 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:43.900
 west not only in goals and varies 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:46.780
 so in theory it allows you to 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:50.050
 focus on your album more accurately 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.600
 It's in practice I'm going to show you the 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:55.180
 what happens is when you pass 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.850
 family on top of your opponent he 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.730
 It's going to be a bit slower than that. 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.739
 will allow you to take off and connect the 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.019
 your best album you can see rang 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:07.239
 patience time there when I step 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.070
 my aim over my opponent in the 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.890
 in case he is demoted it will give a 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:14.140
 Slow down then the time you want 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.720
 accept quick shots and this is very 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.910
 important a difference in the crucible of 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.590
 milliseconds but believe goes for me 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:24.310
 makes a lot of difference 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:27.100
 I changed it and it's the other one for you. 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.740
 to see how each of the brands has a 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.360
 different value so you want colombo 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.340
 I will now show you've spear 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.950
 believe that you have the least value she has 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.120
 Well, just look at how little time she gets. 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.820
 new 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.310
 so the watch is low and by 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.410
 This will not give you so much time to 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.419
 connecting the sun should only be very fast 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:50.680
 even to get right with her 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:52.570
 now my favorite one is r is 49 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.890
 if I'm not mistaken when I realize the college 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.320
 stay longer 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:58.240
 It's on my opponent I'm leaving here 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.640
 closing video all my friends 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.520
 net that I have of the game the value of 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.840
 Each exercise I recommend our 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.500
 life is making noise 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:10.210
 I recommend to you to observe these 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.419
 values still in the upper right corner 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.400
 screen to choose the best snape for 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:18.130
 You are starting the shadow of veils. 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.860
 that happened now is one of the best 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:23.440
 who is starting because she has one in 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.780
 watch higher high of the game and 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.490
 practically drawing water from directors 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.560
 the queen but not in Italy but I 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.229
 I put it that it works as a 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:35.289
 so this is it for today's video guys 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:37.390
 I hope it helped you and you 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:39.870
 did you like the cover of chillÃ¡n that 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:42.330
 leaves even feedback that you have given 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.250
 the video before that but I hope 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.130
 really that has helped you in some way. 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:49.410
 way in your galera people see themselves in the 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:52.100
