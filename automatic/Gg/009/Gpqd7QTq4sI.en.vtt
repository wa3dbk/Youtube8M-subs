00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.090
 you need to know for m 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.980
 jo do not come it's during a 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.599
 day is a good thing of course 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.910
 is for everyone as soon as 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.270
 they have the required age ie is 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.640
 born after 1988 it's for people who 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.559
 have never done as to those who 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.230
 already practice the scooter of the 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.180
 learning begins with a catch 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.589
 in hand on notice of stop 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.309
 knowledge of the accelerator 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:51.120
 discovery of the brakes weight of the machine 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.500
 we will make him an 8 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.670
 a not-so- easy exercise because 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.469
 do we realize that it is necessary 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.949
 bypass the most well looking right 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.199
 in front of 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:03.899
 something that we do not necessarily know but 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.729
 supply on board is able to fall the 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.380
 head and shoulders towards the direction 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:12.720
 final then we had to make a course 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.420
 much longer with more plo more 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.670
 of crossing and already firstly 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.560
 you have to remember the course then 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.060
 well always look in front of us not 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.630
 put your feet on the ground playing with 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.200
 the brakes and the gas grip so 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.200
 more complex 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.909
 they learn to master their craft 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.649
 when they had never done 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.259
 before and since they feel 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.759
 trust in general about beginning 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.920
 in the afternoon we can approach the 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.020
 circulation we start to place them 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.840
 behind the car 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.850
 they are insured they follow me and from 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.520
 when I feel that their level and is 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.460
 correct is good enough they pass 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.810
 in front of the car and goes in guiding and 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.810
 they follow the directions of their good 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:17.410
 so who will slow down the kids all 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.410
 turn here it comes back between them 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:27.420
 on your right from the taxi that arrives 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.340
 work and of course my side is corrected 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.260
 As the lack of control in 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.600
 the indicators are reminded of the rules 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.530
 we come from the circulation part that 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.750
 went pretty well 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.000
 it's very nice to have a monitor 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.290
 who is there in the car and gives you 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.340
 guidance from the guidelines 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.100
 because finally we realize 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.610
 that all alone well we do not hurt 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.620
 errors 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:51.210
 finally who for us are not 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.830
 mistakes but bad habits the 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.480
 license day at m went very well 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.310
 past we did several exercises to 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.510
 understand the maneuverability of the scooter and 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.490
 that's true it's important because 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.320
 we do not necessarily know that the weight 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.410
 is in front behind we do not go well 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.480
 account that has been good for me is that 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.520
 the monitor each time came back 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.500
 on our faults did not hesitate insisted 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.570
 even though our questions could sometimes 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:18.450
 sound ridiculous it was never 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:20.340
 ridiculous after it's up to them to read 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.010
 a little bit about the rules of the road 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.720
 and then to gain experience in 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.720
 practicing without making too many mistakes
