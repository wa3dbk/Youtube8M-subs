00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.370
 They are in this first game in which much between the green 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:14.209
 Do you want that from the 4 0 endstand 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.659
 Not 

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:26.159
 although it is still alive 

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:29.159
 and 9 main topics 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.600
 Lange said, "It's normal that the coach 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.030
 on 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.400
 more 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.130
 the device 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.130
 Dr 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.380
 in Germany 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.750
 under it were 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.100
 Pioneer was great 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.100
 Karzai was three days 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.770
 to have 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.860
 What do you want 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.860
 we do 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.600
 the clock 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.120
 dpa 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.170
 1 1 no 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.200
 I do not see one for 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.200
 Dr 

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:16.319
 Florian a 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.649
 Corner 

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:23.029
 Baar 

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:27.569
 we were close 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.569
 Quarter less important role anymore 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:37.409
 here 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:41.869
 but the hardest always 

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:45.089
 Before we start shooting it is the right book to hear 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.819
 so the right book has found what I no problem the allegations 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:52.809
 No 

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:55.239
 on 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.079
 maybe help us for their interest 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.239
 declared goal strengthened 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.239
 Chelsea's consolation did not succeed the DFB 

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:07.789
 to have 

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:10.789
 I wanted to do it all 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.989
 Dusseldorf 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.899
 that's it alone too 

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:25.899
 had in tiebreak 

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:37.519
 post 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.519
 also as the West where he had some 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:44.189
 our way of working to 60 4 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.959
 we'll see 

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:55.329
 in the course of the establishment of the protectorate Bohemia Moravia will be in these days 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:58.089
 Troop parts created and stored 

00:03:58.089 --> 00:04:01.769
 In addition, we expect the risk Tel soldiers from across the empire 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.149
 reasons 

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:06.449
 that is it 

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:08.199
 the kitchen is needed 

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:11.319
 an average of 2 double grains of wheat are added 

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:15.509
 and this does not serve this 

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:20.699
 I do not have that 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:23.699
 she goes with deliver 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.650
 where should I really check one 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:32.080
 take a scene from the people the wheat to the other 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:36.409
 that was different but it is 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:38.259
 there are no such things 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:39.879
 Do not forget 

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:43.289
 I know what I'm talking about 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:44.170
 history 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.170
 it's exciting 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.210
 not the game 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.210
 is fixed 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:10.469
 enough 

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:17.589
 Ing 

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:20.589
 never 

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:23.819
 trier 

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:27.689
 Harrelson Bayreuther "Meistersinger" everything clearly before marriage 

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:53.860
 His vision to be saved so the vision of Jura Soyfer 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.930
 because you just have to read her a game I have recently 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.730
 in the Great Lakes forests the crazy or other parties 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.039
 but to play along so 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:05.889
 if only I wanted better 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:08.020
 I'll do that 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.740
 Dogs still have the SID during their lunch break 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.860
 written or rewritten in a funny way 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.909
 The players now have to be generous 

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:18.509
 I'm not afraid 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:21.509
 were there 

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:25.469
 48 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.490
 k 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.050
 was a long time 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.800
 they decided similarly relaxed the youngest write interest rates 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.850
 that anyone in this country wants to kill you
