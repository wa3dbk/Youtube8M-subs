00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:03.860
 nice that you look 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.410
 today I am happy to see proposals to a new Dutch presenter 

00:00:08.229 --> 00:00:12.629
 this lady has that well-known x factor everyone always to me 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:13.529
 is looking 

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:15.629
 and yet difficult to find 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:18.960
 I sometimes wondered which presenter can be compared to after 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.699
 but I didn't fall there 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:24.699
 to notice it from her 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.579
 thirty years ago she was born into a drama 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.050
 and has already seen a lot of the world 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.620
 twelve years ago she was first introduced to the presentation of 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.070
 the figures presented show the local radio channel 4 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.010
 done with these two years 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.490
 A little later she was asked to result in a sports television program 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.340
 among those without 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.110
 in the meantime a lot has happened apart from a purchasing power here and there 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.360
 consciously chose to do so 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.710
 to be the volta wife and mother for her two boys 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.360

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.360

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.460
