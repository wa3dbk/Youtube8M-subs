00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.850
 hello dear sas we meet 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.040
 anna from the river of your first communion 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:14.129
 point is that he has come to this charade is 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.740
 to show us your precious project about 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:17.699
 costumes for rent and purchase first 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.529
 communion 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.589
 ghana tell us how this has come about 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.769
 precious project because the project arises 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:28.380
 because given the situation that has 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.689
 Spain and almost all families 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.030
 I thought that we had to rationalize 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.220
 gas one day thinking I say come to a suit 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.460
 of communion is a garment that a girl 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.840
 let's go to the one time then if a man 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.940
 rent a jacket that uses it in 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.390
 several times of course we use 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.540
 more than once and rent it because not a 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.970
 communion suit I think it's one with 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.530
 the idea of listening without doubt a great 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.290
 help for the current moment that we are 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.060
 living all the families and that day 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.610
 so wonderful in which you dream that 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.390
 You want your daughter to have a suit 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.670
 worthy driving and in conditions 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.560
 good regardless of whether the 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.000
 great idea to rent the costumes 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.060
 one of the things that speak and me 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.850
 loved it was the design you have suits for 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.240
 my precious taste like this for example 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.610
 of linen and valenciennes in court empire 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.470
 that is beautiful but tell us 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.570
 what kind of what kind of dress 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.310
 we will find besides this that already 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:29.119
 we are seeing it when this one you can 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:31.100
 find the wine on silk also then 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.470
 you can also change you can play a 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.149
 little to do your job because yes 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.880
 because you change the hose you put 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:40.580
 a little French hand and is this other 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.770
 model of the wild is equal this is given 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.300
 this is linen this is the french hand 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.220
 and this is the wide difference of 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.670
 prices and there are for example between a linen 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:52.880
 or a silk to me maría much hollow for 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.310
 my taste with very good price but also 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.110
 with the ability to leverage a 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.570
 question do I have for example the cabbages 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:04.380
 that force us in some way that 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:10.560
 the girl go with the costume of the appointments 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:13.530
 you have to look at what can also be 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:18.450
 of silk organza and are also rented 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:21.000
 at 99 euros that is the dry cleaner runs 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.069
 on the client's part but let's go 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.900
 ink of life would have cost you the same 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.490
 if you buy it because you have to take it 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.220
 the dye after the girl 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.380
 how it works you enter the web you choose 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.330
 for example this dress we put on 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.800
 contact with you or who is which 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.170
 is the operative how many days do I 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:42.400
 rent when I have to return 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:44.620
 if what we ask please is that I do not 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.020
 leave for the last day because the 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.760
 suits are limited there is demand already 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.980
 better when mom comes, everything in 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.430
 count in how much time in advance 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.890
 shayk emilima a month without to make sure 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.780
 Tomás no longer take a soldered one month with 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.820
 your life you have to ask for it because you do not sell 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.470
 If there was not, maybe we have the 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.660
 possibility of asking only that it is another 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.460
 possibility that the mother has 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.020
 say no I want to rent it but what 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.990
 I want to release then have a 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:14.380
 supplement and put on so many people and 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:16.450
 Also, how do we sell and 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.400
 we rent dresses a little so that the 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.680
 girl do not go with the lean tag 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.720
 rent the suit no one will know if that 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.970
 suit is sold or rented or is 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.280
 a suit that I could have bought 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.230
