clamp on then what you would do is you

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.520 
clamp on then what you would do is you
would<00:01:25.009> hook<00:01:25.280> this<00:01:25.460> directly<00:01:26.149> onto<00:01:26.840> your<00:01:27.170> four

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
would hook this directly onto your four

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.099 
would hook this directly onto your four
inch<00:01:27.740> pipe<00:01:29.289> and<00:01:30.969> then<00:01:31.969> using<00:01:32.359> a<00:01:32.479> four<00:01:32.869> inch

sure that you'll be able to get the

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.940 
sure that you'll be able to get the
fireplace<00:03:54.879> out<00:03:55.150> and<00:03:55.450> the<00:03:56.050> first<00:03:56.290> thing<00:03:56.560> is<00:03:56.769> is

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
fireplace out and the first thing is is

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.729 
fireplace out and the first thing is is
design<00:03:57.670> your<00:03:57.879> system<00:03:58.090> so<00:03:58.870> that<00:03:58.900> the<00:03:59.260> venting

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
design your system so that the venting

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.640 
design your system so that the venting
will<00:04:00.190> be<00:04:00.340> flexible<00:04:00.910> and<00:04:01.180> typical<00:04:02.080> insulation

inch our manufacturers recommendation is

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.610 
inch our manufacturers recommendation is
is<00:04:21.130> that<00:04:21.700> immediately<00:04:22.570> after<00:04:23.050> you<00:04:23.139> leave<00:04:23.410> the

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
is that immediately after you leave the

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.710 
is that immediately after you leave the
fireplace<00:04:24.130> chamber<00:04:24.639> that<00:04:25.120> you<00:04:25.270> would<00:04:25.419> go<00:04:25.570> with

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
fireplace chamber that you would go with

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.110 
fireplace chamber that you would go with
4<00:04:25.960> inch<00:04:26.139> liner<00:04:26.470> all<00:04:27.010> the<00:04:27.340> way<00:04:27.460> up<00:04:27.610> and<00:04:27.760> out<00:04:27.880> the

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
4 inch liner all the way up and out the

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.180 
4 inch liner all the way up and out the
chimney<00:04:28.300> system<00:04:28.660> this<00:04:29.470> is<00:04:29.680> not<00:04:29.710> a<00:04:29.860> code

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
chimney system this is not a code

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.920 
chimney system this is not a code
requirement<00:04:30.850> but<00:04:31.030> it<00:04:31.150> is<00:04:31.300> something<00:04:31.540> that<00:04:31.780> we

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
requirement but it is something that we

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.440 
requirement but it is something that we
as<00:04:32.050> manufacturers<00:04:32.889> would<00:04:33.310> like<00:04:33.550> you<00:04:33.700> to<00:04:33.880> do<00:04:34.030> to

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
as manufacturers would like you to do to

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.960 
as manufacturers would like you to do to
get<00:04:34.630> the<00:04:34.780> best<00:04:35.080> benefit<00:04:35.680> and<00:04:35.860> to<00:04:36.430> make<00:04:36.940> sure

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
get the best benefit and to make sure

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.590 
get the best benefit and to make sure
that<00:04:37.240> you<00:04:37.540> don't<00:04:37.750> have<00:04:37.960> operational<00:04:38.680> problems

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
that you don't have operational problems

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.330 
that you don't have operational problems
so<00:04:40.600> typically<00:04:41.020> what<00:04:41.169> would<00:04:41.320> happen<00:04:41.740> is<00:04:41.919> you

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
so typically what would happen is you

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.000 
so typically what would happen is you
would<00:04:42.610> hook<00:04:42.790> a<00:04:42.850> clean-out<00:04:43.240> T<00:04:43.710> onto<00:04:44.710> the<00:04:44.800> pipe

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
would hook a clean-out T onto the pipe

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.969 
would hook a clean-out T onto the pipe
adapter<00:04:45.190> or<00:04:45.820> you<00:04:46.570> can<00:04:46.780> use<00:04:47.020> a<00:04:47.290> special

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
adapter or you can use a special

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:50.640 
adapter or you can use a special
clean-out<00:04:48.490> T<00:04:48.850> that<00:04:49.120> has<00:04:49.150> the<00:04:49.570> adapter<00:04:50.110> built
