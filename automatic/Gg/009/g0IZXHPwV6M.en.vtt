00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello to all friends a greeting panic e 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.580
 welcome back here on destiny today we return 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.620
 with the usual idole Tuesday where 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.450
 let's analyze one together 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.519
 small and short guide to deal with 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.290
 better the weekly assault drops 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.120
 night for the occasion this 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.760
 week will be set on the moon and 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.250
 to be precise the assault on that 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.119
 who sees the giant ogre as the final boss 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.920
 flight 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.960
 let's see the malus immediately for the bonuses 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.400
 this week then arms 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.900
 of the arc therefore arc damage of 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.660
 any nature are remarkably 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.279
 increased light switch i most 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.930
 of darkness inflict greater damage 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.840
 in close combat I recommend 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.280
 be careful because this is a malus 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.829
 really really important not 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.960
 never forget that there is is how not 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.059
 forget never forget about 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.559
 arms of the bow because as you know in 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.420
 many of these are present in this mission 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.520
 knitting of knights who then doing 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.750
 damage from the arc triples TV 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.250
 destroy the second half not 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.410
 never forget it but we will go to 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.329
 face better after was abbimo 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.399
 on darkness they remain impassive too 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.930
 after suffering substantial damage 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.250
 let's go see what has mine 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.870
 chin crew to deal with this 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.680
 mission that I remember sees the damage to 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.330
 arc tripled therefore fate fate 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.340
 obviously if you are the sorcerer 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.520
 make yourself cantone of the sun with radiance 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.920
 we said fate and patience time and 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.810
 if you have a heavy legendary 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.700
 as a deviant gravity that does damage to dar 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.259
 that unfortunately I do not have it then me 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.299
 satisfied with my zena ma revenge 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.670
 already consort fatal time and patience 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.070
 we are really going to the greatest 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.560
 so keep in mind all that 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.450
 I told you and let's go ahead step by step 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.909
 by step all the phases of this 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.770
 very difficult mission this assault 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.450
 will not be particularly long from 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.009
 complete but will present some 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.840
 fairly difficult parts e 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.090
 above all you will have to stay very long 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.310
 beware of those who are the enemies who 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.470
 they do arc damage then knights and 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.090
 maliarde and above all the enemies that you 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.890
 they will run to attack you 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.630
 own body because why not 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.090
 forget that with a simple touch of 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.409
 body to body you will instantly die one 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.000
 once you have kept all of them in mind 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.850
 these things take your store ee 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.649
 don't do what I'm doing because 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.329
 I wanted to immediately show you what happens 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.910
 if you are too bold you see that 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.770
 even a simple desecrated slave there 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.780
 he can kill with a simple attack 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.270
 body to body so girls be 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.430
 cautious 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.380
 once you understand, understand this 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.390
 small dynamics put yourself at the end of 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.460
 this little room and together with yours 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.080
 adventure companions kill the 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.120
 knights t-shirts that you 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.680
 they will bother us there will take it 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.360
 a long time the important thing is that you are 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.680
 be careful not to risk anything once 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.660
 that the enemies are almost all dead and 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.960
 you can go out like I'm doing for 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.550
 go and kill the last remaining 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:39.340
 advanced until you reach the room where 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.010
 we will have to face three hordes of enemies 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.630
 decipher between and rule and the first will be 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.310
 very simple as you see they will run 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.200
 simply wearing slaves who 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.300
 we could rather kill 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.100
 simple especially if you are in 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.750
 possession like me of fateful fate 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.490
 be careful not to go too live 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.170
 of the action because you see that 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.970
 slaves the explosive ones will risk to 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.760
 put me in serious trouble if there is one 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.950
 you will find more than one in the middle will break through 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.230
 also some consecrated knight 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.910
 so the yellow life however will not be a 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.310
 problem kill it also because if you are 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:13.330
 entered concentrated fire on you there 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.250
 you will be discreetly smooth as on 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.020
 usually over this wave you go in 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.850
 ride pick up the ammunition there 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.700
 they serve to face the phase 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.250
 next which will be composed as you see 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.850
 mostly from acolytes and also 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.380
 some knights like before 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.750
 will come to try to annoy him and 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.400
 a rising ascending shirt that like 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.600
 see red life then once 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:39.340
 removed the shield will really be 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.530
 really doing kill the same 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.380
 what is worth for the knights is convinced 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.090
 red and yellow life are not 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.570
 these first steps to get in 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.320
 difficulty 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:52.900
 the hardest thing will come between a few 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.180
 minutes as usual kill in the 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.120
 last enemies left go around 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.530
 stock up on all the ammunition that 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.850
 find more ammo you have better 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.920
 because in this part it could be 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.230
 a little bit more waiters spooner 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.230
 they have a lot a lot of mischief 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.880
 you see I don't remember the exact number not 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.680
 do as my companions are doing 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.320
 team or as soon as you see them 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.940
 bad guys out of their lair escaped 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.079
 immediately I will have to do a here 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.569
 small 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.250
 a little let's say intervention 

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:24.979
 emergency to succeed the animals and 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.870
 once done this run to the end 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:28.159
 of these scales you will see that the evil ones 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.949
 they will follow you because they are 

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:32.360
 basically stupid we put ourselves 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:33.770
 at the bottom with our sniper to damage 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.360
 arched in this case the patience time 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.629
 and see that they won't take long at 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.310
 on the contrary, die very little once killed 

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:42.349
 all jerseys with this technique vi 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.110
 remember wait for them at the end 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:46.419
 stairs and not advanced they will come to 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:50.300
 look for you can quietly 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:52.159
 advancing within the assault mi 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.659
 I still recommend small ones 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:56.120
 recommendations for the first step 

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:57.949
 maliarde are many boys so not 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.719
 be too reckless maybe put us 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:01.099
 a few more minutes and kills paintings with 

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:02.840
 the method that I showed you 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:05.060
 you will arrive later in this 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.469
 room where there is an ogre a knight 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.539
 consecrated and all these little ones 

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:10.430
 slaves that you will be wearing for 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:12.069
 give you trouble you are obliged to 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.479
 kill everyone, but as you can see, put yourself there 

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:16.729
 really really just look at these 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:18.949
 slaves that will occasionally be able to you 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:21.379
 to meet to try to kill you 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:23.569
 by their explosion 

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:25.310
 once this small area is completed 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:27.139
 go to the next step which is 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.629
 the final one of the boss 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:32.150
 but first we 'll be in this salon 

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:34.490
 it's full of people as you can see escaped 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.710
 all don't stop killing anyone 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.539
 an enemy of any kind will answer one 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.580
 knit burns at your back that you can 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:41.930
 give you trouble but as you can see enough 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.789
 the riders smooth on the road 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.379
 will put a little bit and react to 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:47.810
 your arrival you do as we are 

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:50.719
 simply by running straight 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:53.659
 and nobody will bother you here we are 

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:55.759
 got this huge ogre on fire with 

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:57.789
 that sort of cyst as I call it 

00:05:55.759 --> 00:06:01.039
 under the head it will be the critical point 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:03.529
 arrive in the room to check gate 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:05.750
 and throw everything at him once 

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:07.250
 who will lose the chains that he can then 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.449
 move inside the room made 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.580
 exactly like I'm doing 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:12.680
 put yourself in this exact spot e 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:15.020
 pull them all ammunition ad 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.460
 bow you have put yourself at this point 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.800
 precise because in this way e 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.360
 the screamer that will break through you 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.550
 you will see that you will not be able to do any 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.529
 damage because you are protected by the wall 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:27.050
 I repeat, take them all 

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:27.680
 ammunition you have is three or you are 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.360
 alone 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.729
 this makes no difference will put us 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.680
 really little to go 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:34.259
 because with arc damage he feels one 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.370
 really firepower really 

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:40.930
 important after about a minute a 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:42.279
 minute and a half of hammering in focus 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.229
 between once you enjoyed yourself 

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:46.389
 the whole mission will be over I hope 

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:47.860
 be lucky in the drops as usual 

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:50.409
 thank you for watching this video 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:52.029
 comment if you have a strategy 

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:53.830
 different from mine or if you like that 

00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:55.629
 which used to make you this mini 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:56.949
 guide leave a like that is always 

00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:58.749
 appreciated and we see each other today 

00:06:56.949 --> 00:07:02.159
 afternoon with a video that I recommend 

00:06:58.749 --> 00:07:02.159
 not to miss a panic greeting
