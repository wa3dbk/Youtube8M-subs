 Today I am going to show you some ideas very very 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.029
 simple to decorate your room for 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.619
 this season christmas december in 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.930
 Personal vienna I love December 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.030
 since few favorites of my months 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.910
 favorites some things buy them 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.129
 To decorate other things I made them 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.650
 three or four ideas which I show you 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.750
 it's very easy to me I loved it I like the 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.059
 red I love red much remember 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.740
 that if you like the video do not forget 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.930
 armani is up and we go in the video 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.000
 the most important thing for me is the tree of 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.160
 Christmas I bought a little girl and also 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.170
 buy some spheres to decorate are 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.170
 of plastic so they are very cheap 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.270
 also buys some hooks from 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.790
 same color of the tree so that it does not 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.470
 see the spheres when I put them and 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.060
 they love these spheres because they are 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.910
 different types some have 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.910
 glitter others are not kill me love 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.530
 add as an ornament the tree to 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:23.750
 It looks very beautiful and lights are 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.850
 important the lights indeed this 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.979
 he had to make the first step but he did not 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.539
 I 'm going to add them at the end and 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.729
 they need to be very careful because they 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:33.729
 can entangle the series with the spheres 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.070
 we can not forget about the 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.530
 star is the smallest I found 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.119
 and I love how my tree looks can 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.909
 add also any little detail and 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.890
 I added this on my door I like it a lot 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.840
 the red I love it not on my desk 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.110
 I also put some things to decorate 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.930
 I liked polo I love it and a candy 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.250
 the handles are my favorite sweets 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.140
 I love 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.360
 and obviously we can not forget about 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.160
 the lights I think you're behind me 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.440
 bed on the wall because I feel that 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:12.240
 they stand out a lot and at night you see 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.240
 beautiful beautiful wow 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.460
 I also bought these little stars in a 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.770
 mercadito and they are like miller I put them 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:23.210
 my wall because they have glitter and like 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.210
 at night they look beautiful 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.680
 and continuing with the ornaments also with 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.810
 what this sign are so everything 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.880
 That is bright I love it because I 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.890
 assault a lot at night also with what 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.350
 than other tiny Christmas ornaments 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.470
 and some snowflakes with many many 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.450
 glitters in the couple 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.790
 and now I'm going to show you the things that 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.710
 I did to decorate my room we are going to 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.380
 need a glass bottle 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.990
 I already showed this to you, I believe in others 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.970
 of water and it does not matter first we're going to 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.860
 paint with spray the color that you 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.710
 want I chose red because it goes with the 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.110
 Christmas and let's spray a little we're going to 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.090
 go placing the glitter until it 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.850
 hit now if I covered the whole bottle 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.220
 because I want it to look so very very 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.560
 bright and place the ornament you want 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.080
 any flower 18 in the second idea 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.870
 we are going to need a wooden box a 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.209
 red white paint design and one 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.760
 sponge to paint with paint 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.620
 white let's paint the front 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.480
 from our box is where we are going to 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.670
 put the design as it has dried 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.200
 we are going to place the design that I have 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.750
 chosen I chose this snowflake 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.550
 because we're going with the season and with the 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.080
 red paint let's paint you 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.910
 I recommend it to be with a sponge 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.890
 because with brushes you can go from 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.020
 design and can stain since you've 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.090
 finished painting the whole box we're going 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.340
 to remove the design if it stained a 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.900
 little bit tries to compose the volumes 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.900
 the little one with paint 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.129
 and that's the way our little box is and that's it 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:56.150
 you can put anything you want 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:56.150
 and what else do you like 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.870
 and in the third idea we are going to need 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:03.209
 A wooden frame glitter paint 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.640
 red and a sponge and with the paint 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.980
 red let's paint our entire frame 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.550
 I saw three passes to make it super 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.280
 Super good 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.050
 yes 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.209
 since it has dried super good the 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.100
 paint let's now place a little bit of 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.079
 white glue me with the same 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.450
 brochita that I used to paint what I'm going 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.970
 to put very well in the entire margin and 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.280
 we are going to place glitter and that 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.689
 hit super good and look very good 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.539
 pegadito 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:33.879
 I made two frames just like that and you can 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:36.370
 place the photo that you like and that 

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:38.530
 is all that easy 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.870
 and finally to decorate I put some 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.300
 red and white cushions filled with 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.000
 Christmas and also my quilts to 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:49.120
 some red ones and see so you stay at night 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.110
 You see a lot much better but I love it 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.760
 See beautiful 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.070
 I hope you liked it 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:57.479
 have served the ideas we see in the 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.479
 next video by 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.360
 so
