here it starts here if you move in and
you<00:05:36.890> can<00:05:37.070> catch<00:05:37.280> me<00:05:37.490> before<00:05:37.640> I<00:05:37.880> get<00:05:38.060> a<00:05:38.090> good

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:39.890 
swing with that stick you're better off

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.270 
swing with that stick you're better off
but<00:05:40.760> by<00:05:40.970> nature<00:05:41.350> naturally<00:05:42.350> you<00:05:42.710> don't<00:05:42.950> want

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
but by nature naturally you don't want

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.219 
but by nature naturally you don't want
to<00:05:43.370> move<00:05:43.490> in<00:05:43.669> if<00:05:43.880> you're<00:05:44.419> not<00:05:44.630> training<00:05:45.020> to

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:45.229 
to move in if you're not training to

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:47.620 
to move in if you're not training to
move<00:05:45.560> in<00:05:45.770> you're<00:05:46.190> not<00:05:46.400> going<00:05:46.760> to<00:05:46.910> move<00:05:47.030> in<00:05:47.240> so

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:47.630 
move in you're not going to move in so

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.750 
move in you're not going to move in so
we're<00:05:47.810> talking<00:05:48.020> about<00:05:48.229> a<00:05:48.530> very<00:05:48.830> basic<00:05:49.160> pattern

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
we're talking about a very basic pattern

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.029 
we're talking about a very basic pattern
of<00:05:49.850> just<00:05:50.030> moving<00:05:50.510> in<00:05:50.630> just<00:05:51.229> don't<00:05:51.590> step<00:05:51.800> it<00:05:51.950> up

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:52.039 
of just moving in just don't step it up

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:56.370 
of just moving in just don't step it up
step<00:05:52.940> it<00:05:52.970> up<00:05:53.210> wrestling<00:05:53.919> boxing<00:05:55.120> karate

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.380 
step it up wrestling boxing karate

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.270 
step it up wrestling boxing karate
stepping<00:05:57.380> up<00:05:57.530> that's<00:05:57.860> it

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.280 
stepping up that's it

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.300 
stepping up that's it
basic<00:05:58.789> but<00:05:59.600> the<00:06:00.050> scenarios<00:06:00.650> are<00:06:00.830> different<00:06:01.160> if

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
basic but the scenarios are different if

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.129 
basic but the scenarios are different if
the<00:06:01.580> scenarios<00:06:02.090> and<00:06:02.210> the<00:06:02.300> circumstances<00:06:02.990> are

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:03.139 
the scenarios and the circumstances are

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:04.840 
the scenarios and the circumstances are
different<00:06:03.350> something's<00:06:04.190> going<00:06:04.490> on<00:06:04.639> in<00:06:04.760> your

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:04.850 
different something's going on in your

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.300 
different something's going on in your
head<00:06:05.120> and<00:06:05.330> that<00:06:05.960> is<00:06:06.080> going<00:06:06.380> to<00:06:06.530> affect<00:06:06.979> whether

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
head and that is going to affect whether

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.159 
head and that is going to affect whether
or<00:06:07.400> not<00:06:07.580> you<00:06:07.820> use<00:06:08.120> that<00:06:08.360> basic<00:06:08.780> pattern

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:09.169 
or not you use that basic pattern

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:11.620 
or not you use that basic pattern
whether<00:06:09.650> or<00:06:09.770> not<00:06:09.919> how<00:06:10.430> it's<00:06:11.090> going<00:06:11.300> to<00:06:11.360> affect

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:11.630 
whether or not how it's going to affect

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.810 
whether or not how it's going to affect
whether<00:06:11.990> you<00:06:12.200> use<00:06:12.320> a<00:06:12.350> basic<00:06:12.710> pattern<00:06:13.039> if<00:06:13.580> your

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:13.820 
whether you use a basic pattern if your

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.020 
whether you use a basic pattern if your
timing<00:06:14.330> is<00:06:14.360> off<00:06:14.539> using<00:06:14.930> that<00:06:15.020> basic<00:06:15.229> pattern

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.030 
timing is off using that basic pattern

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.400 
timing is off using that basic pattern
or<00:06:17.030> if<00:06:17.240> you're<00:06:17.419> confident<00:06:17.900> enough<00:06:18.080> to<00:06:18.139> use

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:18.410 
or if you're confident enough to use

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.379 
or if you're confident enough to use
that<00:06:18.440> basic<00:06:19.010> pattern<00:06:19.340> all<00:06:19.700> right<00:06:19.880> so<00:06:20.210> those

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:20.389 
that basic pattern all right so those

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:21.430 
that basic pattern all right so those
are<00:06:20.570> the<00:06:20.630> two<00:06:20.780> things<00:06:20.990> you<00:06:21.139> need<00:06:21.289> to

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 
are the two things you need to

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.140 
are the two things you need to
understand<00:06:21.889> one<00:06:22.280> if<00:06:22.520> you're<00:06:22.669> not<00:06:22.850> getting

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.150 
understand one if you're not getting

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.330 
understand one if you're not getting
away<00:06:23.270> from<00:06:23.750> the<00:06:24.169> person<00:06:24.620> in<00:06:24.770> front<00:06:25.070> of<00:06:25.190> you

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:25.340 
away from the person in front of you

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.190 
away from the person in front of you
that<00:06:25.880> if<00:06:26.090> you're<00:06:26.240> not<00:06:26.270> using<00:06:26.419> your<00:06:26.750> footwork

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:27.200 
that if you're not using your footwork

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.740 
that if you're not using your footwork
to<00:06:27.410> run<00:06:27.800> or<00:06:28.100> to<00:06:28.160> get<00:06:28.580> away<00:06:28.639> from<00:06:28.880> engagement<00:06:29.389> to

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:29.750 
to run or to get away from engagement to

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.659 
to run or to get away from engagement to
avoid<00:06:30.050> engagement<00:06:30.650> then<00:06:31.010> your<00:06:31.220> footwork

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:31.669 
avoid engagement then your footwork

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:34.000 
avoid engagement then your footwork
should<00:06:31.940> be<00:06:32.060> used<00:06:32.330> to<00:06:32.539> gain<00:06:32.870> an<00:06:33.110> advantage<00:06:33.349> in

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.010 
should be used to gain an advantage in

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.580 
should be used to gain an advantage in
position<00:06:34.580> and<00:06:34.700> that<00:06:35.150> position<00:06:35.210> is<00:06:35.900> likely<00:06:36.229> not

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:36.590 
position and that position is likely not

going<00:06:36.860> to<00:06:36.919> be<00:06:37.039> the

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:47.979 
that you no matter what pattern you use

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:49.829 
that you no matter what pattern you use
you<00:06:48.400> have<00:06:48.430> to<00:06:48.639> train<00:06:49.089> that<00:06:49.360> pattern<00:06:49.719> of

00:06:49.829 --> 00:06:49.839 
you have to train that pattern of

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:52.379 
you have to train that pattern of
footwork<00:06:50.199> based<00:06:50.830> on<00:06:51.099> the<00:06:51.219> circumstances<00:06:52.089> all

if you don't trade that way then your

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:26.219 
if you don't trade that way then your
instinct<00:07:25.060> is<00:07:25.120> going<00:07:25.360> to<00:07:25.479> take<00:07:25.659> over<00:07:25.870> and

00:07:26.219 --> 00:07:26.229 
instinct is going to take over and

00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:28.050 
instinct is going to take over and
you're<00:07:26.469> going<00:07:26.740> to<00:07:26.800> retreat<00:07:27.129> and<00:07:27.400> might<00:07:27.669> end<00:07:27.849> up
