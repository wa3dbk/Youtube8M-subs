00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
graphite on there see there got my

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.310 
graphite on there see there got my
finger<00:00:57.129> all<00:00:57.280> next<00:00:57.550> okay<00:00:58.090> then<00:00:59.079> what<00:00:59.199> we're

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
sketchbook so you're going to flip your

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.030 
sketchbook so you're going to flip your
sketchbook<00:01:07.780> page<00:01:07.990> over<00:01:08.290> flip<00:01:08.560> it<00:01:08.649> back<00:01:08.830> over

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
sketchbook page over flip it back over

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.080 
sketchbook page over flip it back over
and<00:01:09.159> try<00:01:09.399> and<00:01:09.520> line<00:01:09.640> up<00:01:09.820> the<00:01:11.580> foam<00:01:12.580> as<00:01:12.759> best<00:01:12.970> you

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
and try and line up the foam as best you

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.420 
and try and line up the foam as best you
can<00:01:13.270> with<00:01:13.390> the<00:01:13.540> drawing<00:01:13.810> okay<00:01:14.470> then<00:01:15.250> next

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
can with the drawing okay then next

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.490 
can with the drawing okay then next
you're<00:01:15.700> just<00:01:15.759> going<00:01:16.270> to<00:01:16.450> trace<00:01:16.899> back<00:01:17.170> over

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
you're just going to trace back over

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.190 
you're just going to trace back over
your<00:01:17.590> drawing<00:01:18.539> you're<00:01:19.539> just<00:01:19.690> gonna<00:01:19.810> kind<00:01:20.140> of

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
your drawing you're just gonna kind of

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.050 
your drawing you're just gonna kind of
check<00:01:20.710> after<00:01:21.100> you<00:01:21.160> do<00:01:21.250> a<00:01:21.280> little<00:01:21.550> bit<00:01:21.700> to<00:01:21.910> make

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
check after you do a little bit to make

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.730 
check after you do a little bit to make
sure<00:01:22.240> that<00:01:22.360> it's<00:01:22.539> transferring<00:01:23.229> over<00:01:23.530> well

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
sure that it's transferring over well

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.690 
sure that it's transferring over well
okay<00:01:25.380> it's<00:01:26.380> not<00:01:26.560> just<00:01:26.950> kind<00:01:27.100> of<00:01:27.220> fix<00:01:27.490> it

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
okay it's not just kind of fix it

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.080 
okay it's not just kind of fix it
according<00:01:28.240> all<00:01:28.990> right<00:01:29.789> because<00:01:30.789> it<00:01:30.910> may<00:01:31.060> not

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
according all right because it may not

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.719 
according all right because it may not
transfer<00:01:31.630> over<00:01:31.960> perfectly<00:01:32.800> but<00:01:33.039> the

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
transfer over perfectly but the

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.999 
transfer over perfectly but the
important<00:01:34.060> thing<00:01:34.240> is<00:01:34.360> that<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:35.619> end<00:01:35.800> up<00:01:35.890> with

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
important thing is that you end up with

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.219 
important thing is that you end up with
a<00:01:36.039> sharp<00:01:36.369> pencil<00:01:36.640> before<00:01:37.509> you<00:01:37.600> do<00:01:37.780> this<00:01:37.990> so

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
a sharp pencil before you do this so

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.070 
a sharp pencil before you do this so
that<00:01:38.259> way<00:01:38.560> it'll<00:01:38.830> transfer<00:01:39.310> over<00:01:39.429> even<00:01:39.820> better

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
that way it'll transfer over even better

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.930 
that way it'll transfer over even better
okay

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
okay

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.460 
okay
then<00:01:42.940> I'm<00:01:43.060> just<00:01:43.090> gonna<00:01:43.330> basically<00:01:43.690> just<00:01:44.140> carve

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
then I'm just gonna basically just carve

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.260 
then I'm just gonna basically just carve
into<00:01:44.740> it

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.410 

continue<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.140> trace<00:01:49.409> over<00:01:49.619> my<00:01:49.890> drawing<00:01:50.420> and

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
continue to trace over my drawing and

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.240 
continue to trace over my drawing and
what<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.689> graphite<00:01:52.109> is<00:01:52.289> doing<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:52.679> everywhere

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
what the graphite is doing is everywhere

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.469 
what the graphite is doing is everywhere
you<00:01:53.429> touch<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:55.460> it'll<00:01:56.460> transfer<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.210> line

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
you touch it it'll transfer that line

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.660 
you touch it it'll transfer that line
over<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:58.259> make<00:01:58.469> sure<00:01:58.649> not<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:58.860> put<00:01:59.250> your<00:01:59.429> hand

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
over so make sure not to put your hand

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.859 
over so make sure not to put your hand
down<00:01:59.820> on<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.090> paper<00:02:00.299> because<00:02:00.600> then<00:02:00.750> you'll

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
down on the paper because then you'll

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.289 
down on the paper because then you'll
get<00:02:00.960> graphite<00:02:01.439> everywhere<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.880> don't<00:02:03.030> want

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
get graphite everywhere you don't want

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:14.940 
get graphite everywhere you don't want
that<00:02:05.090> okay

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.220 

that<00:02:15.940> ought<00:02:16.090> to<00:02:16.120> be<00:02:16.300> enough<00:02:16.480> for<00:02:16.810> you<00:02:16.930> guys<00:02:16.990> to

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
that ought to be enough for you guys to

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.309 
that ought to be enough for you guys to
