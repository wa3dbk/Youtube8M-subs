innovative<00:00:12.450> price<00:00:12.750> we<00:00:13.019> just<00:00:13.170> came<00:00:13.290> out<00:00:13.440> as<00:00:13.590> a

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
innovative price we just came out as a

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.530 
innovative price we just came out as a
dual<00:00:13.889> window<00:00:14.160> switch<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:14.940> what's<00:00:15.420> really

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
dual window switch and what's really

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.180 
dual window switch and what's really
cool<00:00:15.690> about<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:16.020> dual<00:00:16.260> window<00:00:16.440> switch<00:00:16.830> is<00:00:17.039> that

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
cool about a dual window switch is that

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.130 
cool about a dual window switch is that
it<00:00:17.580> allows<00:00:17.670> you<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.090> run<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.240> shift<00:00:18.600> light<00:00:18.869> and

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
it allows you to run a shift light and

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.769 
it allows you to run a shift light and
like<00:00:19.890> nitrous<00:00:20.340> for<00:00:20.580> example<00:00:21.090> our<00:00:21.480> water

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
like nitrous for example our water

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.779 
like nitrous for example our water
injection<00:00:22.320> but<00:00:23.070> what's<00:00:23.250> really<00:00:23.369> unique<00:00:23.460> about

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
injection but what's really unique about

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.820 
injection but what's really unique about
our<00:00:23.970> product<00:00:24.510> is<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:25.080> not<00:00:25.170> only<00:00:25.320> easy<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.650> do<00:00:25.800> a

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
our product is it not only easy to do a

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.019 
our product is it not only easy to do a
window<00:00:26.070> switch<00:00:26.310> but<00:00:26.490> also<00:00:26.640> has<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:26.910> built-in

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
window switch but also has a built-in

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.240 
window switch but also has a built-in
tack<00:00:27.630> adapter<00:00:28.170> so<00:00:28.650> like<00:00:28.800> for<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.010> lot<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.160> the

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
tack adapter so like for a lot of the

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.250 
tack adapter so like for a lot of the
new<00:00:29.429> flooring<00:00:29.880> cars<00:00:30.119> or<00:00:30.779> like<00:00:30.990> for<00:00:31.170> example

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
new flooring cars or like for example

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.860 
new flooring cars or like for example
even<00:00:31.650> afford<00:00:32.009> there<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.820> no<00:00:33.000> tak<00:00:33.270> output<00:00:33.719> from

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
even afford there is no tak output from

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.069 
even afford there is no tak output from
the<00:00:33.989> ECM<00:00:34.559> so<00:00:35.309> with<00:00:36.180> this<00:00:36.300> allows<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.899> do<00:00:36.960> is

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
the ECM so with this allows you to do is

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.479 
the ECM so with this allows you to do is
allows<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.500> hook<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.770> system<00:00:38.100> up<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.370> it

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
allows you to hook the system up and it

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.069 
allows you to hook the system up and it
takes<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.790> single<00:00:38.969> off<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.540> positive

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
takes a single off of the positive

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.830 
takes a single off of the positive
injector<00:00:41.070> harness<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.940> signal<00:00:42.270> for<00:00:42.390> many<00:00:42.570> any

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
injector harness the signal for many any

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.299 
injector harness the signal for many any
one<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.110> your<00:00:43.320> eight<00:00:43.530> or<00:00:43.800> for<00:00:44.100> whatever

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
one of your eight or for whatever

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.760 
one of your eight or for whatever
injector<00:00:44.910> harnesses<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:46.170> allows<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.649> to

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
injector harnesses and it allows you to

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.680 
injector harnesses and it allows you to
actually<00:00:46.920> get<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.219> tax<00:00:47.460> signal<00:00:47.850> from<00:00:48.480> that

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
actually get a tax signal from that

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.720 
actually get a tax signal from that
perspective<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.350> can<00:00:49.469> then<00:00:49.649> add<00:00:49.890> an<00:00:50.129> external

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
perspective you can then add an external

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.450 
perspective you can then add an external
tachometer<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:52.440> also<00:00:52.559> allows<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.250> set

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
tachometer and it also allows you to set

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.950 
tachometer and it also allows you to set
a<00:00:53.489> window<00:00:53.879> switch<00:00:54.120> which<00:00:54.329> means<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.780> a

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
a window switch which means that a

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.049 
a window switch which means that a
predetermined<00:00:55.829> rpm<00:00:56.309> where<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.550> product<00:00:56.910> can

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
predetermined rpm where a product can

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.450 
predetermined rpm where a product can
turn<00:00:57.270> on<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.750> off<00:00:57.870> for<00:00:58.500> example<00:00:58.859> like<00:00:58.980> nitrous

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
turn on and off for example like nitrous

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.910 
turn on and off for example like nitrous
so<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.239> probably<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:00.899> primary<00:01:01.320> focus<00:01:01.739> is

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
so this probably is primary focus is

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.889 
so this probably is primary focus is
going<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.399> be<00:01:02.460> nitrous<00:01:02.940> guys<00:01:03.449> who<00:01:03.600> want<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.809> run

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
going to be nitrous guys who want to run

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.140 
going to be nitrous guys who want to run
a<00:01:03.930> single<00:01:04.199> even<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.619> dual<00:01:04.830> stage<00:01:05.159> nitrous<00:01:05.640> but

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
a single even a dual stage nitrous but

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.100 
a single even a dual stage nitrous but
what's<00:01:06.299> cool<00:01:06.479> about<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.930> they're

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
what's cool about it is they're

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.810 
what's cool about it is they're
independent<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.740> each<00:01:07.830> other<00:01:08.010> so<00:01:08.549> even<00:01:08.790> though

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
independent of each other so even though

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.030 
independent of each other so even though
it's<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.060> do<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.270> windows<00:01:09.630> which<00:01:09.840> they<00:01:10.650> both<00:01:10.860> have

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
it's a do a windows which they both have

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.760 
it's a do a windows which they both have
their<00:01:11.130> own<00:01:11.189> on<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.909> off<00:01:12.090> rpm<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.350> this<00:01:13.500> is

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
their own on and off rpm so is this is

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.950 
their own on and off rpm so is this is
this<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.040> hard<00:01:14.369> product<00:01:14.970> hard<00:01:15.509> product<00:01:15.900> to

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
this a hard product hard product to

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.080 
this a hard product hard product to
install<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.439> would<00:01:16.830> like<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.189> have<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.369> Ford<00:01:17.729> so

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
install it would like I have a Ford so

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.080 
install it would like I have a Ford so
Ford's<00:01:18.540> kind<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.930> kind<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.890> difficult<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.880> does

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
Ford's kind of kind of difficult it does

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.429 
Ford's kind of kind of difficult it does
seem<00:01:21.270> kind<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.540> complicated<00:01:22.020> but<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.290> reality

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
seem kind of complicated but in reality

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.010 
seem kind of complicated but in reality
is<00:01:22.860> not<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:23.369> basically<00:01:23.939> got<00:01:24.180> five<00:01:24.450> wires<00:01:24.689> you

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
is not this basically got five wires you

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.539 
is not this basically got five wires you
really<00:01:25.229> don't<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.740> only<00:01:25.860> really<00:01:26.100> need<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.430> use

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
really don't you only really need to use

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.819 
really don't you only really need to use
for<00:01:26.909> so<00:01:27.479> in<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:27.689> case<00:01:27.900> we<00:01:28.140> have<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.290> blue<00:01:28.560> wire

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
for so in this case we have a blue wire

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.800 
for so in this case we have a blue wire
which<00:01:29.100> would<00:01:29.280> be<00:01:29.400> your<00:01:29.640> signal<00:01:30.299> one<00:01:30.509> with<00:01:30.780> a

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
which would be your signal one with a

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.840 
which would be your signal one with a
purple<00:01:31.259> wire<00:01:31.470> it's<00:01:32.070> all<00:01:32.159> color-coded<00:01:32.670> which

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
purple wire it's all color-coded which

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.969 
purple wire it's all color-coded which
is<00:01:32.939> signal<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:34.020> then<00:01:34.110> positive<00:01:34.650> and

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
is signal to and then positive and

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.830

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.460 
put a little twist on that our drive
shot<00:02:33.360> loop<00:02:33.540> that<00:02:33.690> only<00:02:33.810> keeps<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.260> drive

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
shot loop that only keeps the drive

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.470 
shot loop that only keeps the drive
shaft<00:02:34.709> in<00:02:34.860> place<00:02:34.920> but<00:02:35.220> it<00:02:35.340> also<00:02:35.459> ties<00:02:36.239> the

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
shaft in place but it also ties the

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.270 
shaft in place but it also ties the
several<00:02:36.840> chassis<00:02:37.080> points<00:02:37.560> on<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.770> vehicle<00:02:37.800> so

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
several chassis points on the vehicle so

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.130 
several chassis points on the vehicle so
it<00:02:38.310> acts<00:02:38.489> as<00:02:38.610> a<00:02:38.640> G<00:02:38.910> low<00:02:39.060> brace<00:02:39.330> it<00:02:39.840> actually

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
it acts as a G low brace it actually

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.840 
it acts as a G low brace it actually
ties<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.530> chassis<00:02:40.769> together<00:02:41.040> left<00:02:41.489> to<00:02:41.640> right

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
ties the chassis together left to right

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.270
