00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.359
 wild horses in the meadow of each 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.359
 band a small village of santander 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.550
 you have contemplated the beauty that 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.900
 reflects the horses galloping on the 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.890
 Meadow 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.529
 they shake their mane whipping their caves on 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.000
 air just grazes its large and 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.119
 majestic bodies 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.050
 They gather in packs forming family 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:34.630
 beautiful pactando in the fields and 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:38.170
 sunset they go down to drink on the shores 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:41.800
 of the streams submerging their snouts 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:44.920
 in the clear waters looking watching so 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:48.400
 beautiful picture in the distance the splendor 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:52.329
 of the sun when hiding my god that 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.850
 colorful games form the twilight 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.320
 I hear the noise of the agitated helmets 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.660
 Grass 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.930
 running towards the forest that will be your 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.960
 home to shelter from the cold night 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:08.620
 and dark until the serene clarity 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.520
 Twilight takes them back to the 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.799
 world to graze 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.429
 and the mare with her horse and small 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:20.060
 foal box that picture to be able 

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:22.880
 capture on a canvas of fine linen magic 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.220
 landscape to reflect and to last all 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.580
 an eternity 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.570
 memories of my childhood hours 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:35.260
 calm sitting on the fresh grass 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.260
 fleeing from the harsh reality 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:42.580
 placid vision contemplated with a look 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:47.200
 tender produces in the spirit peace and 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:50.470
 calmness that one looks for longing 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.930
 of the most elevated transcendent the mind 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:56.840
 that has been dormant and not asleep 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.710
 airs of independence feel in me 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.060
 live but never consolidate and 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.090
 definitely the relationship that exists 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:10.420
 between the past that left my mark 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:13.300
 present great part of my submerged 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.150
 and I'll let the sun boost me 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.450
 shine my personality will emerge from the 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.319
 depths of the magnetic figures 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:26.829
 of the wild horses contemplated 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:30.159
 increasing my joy for a new life 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:33.459
 revalue everyone who loves me 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:36.319
 seduced with truth clean love 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:39.650
 I will stop looking for the need for ties 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.920
 that do not connect me with friends that maybe 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.890
 they never came to love me 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.590
 I will not look for encounters of whoever removes 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.209
 the morels continue with the 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:54.270
 corner of solitude full of fantasy 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:57.790
 I will be attentive to my own perceptions 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.880
 unconscious and I will enjoy remembering 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:05.650
 always the meadows with the horses 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:09.560
 savages contemplated with my gaze on 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:15.069
 the beautiful people bequeath the band
