00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:25.939
 hello youtube friends 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.890
 I am figueroa xy in this tutorial les 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.050
 I will help with a problem that deals with the 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.329
 god of war 2 this was requested by a 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.100
 user called dante so he tells me 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.370
 that when you run the game the god of 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.800
 war 2 is very slow, this happens in 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.960
 some computers suddenly by the 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.270
 requirements or as a rule they have a 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.310
 processor very low then this will 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.260
 will be of great use to all users 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.420
 who also suffer from this same 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.130
 problem and this also works with 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.580
 all games that have for example 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:58.220
 the resident evil 5 or the resident evil 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.230
 operation raccoon city which is also a 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.970
 game that is of mothers but is a 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.630
 very heavy game 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:08.270
 call of duty ops black and others good 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.460
 let's start, they'll go to the link of the 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.170
 description of the video and I will leave you the 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.200
 codes that we will use in this 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.380
 tutorial just follow my steps and nothing 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.570
 will go wrong xdddd good copy the first 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.900
 code of the video description and it 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.840
 they will go to your desk and they will click 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.880
 Right mouse and new document 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.460
 text and here they will paste the code that 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.260
 they finished copying after that 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.300
 minimize the text document and 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.310
 will go to the shortcut of the game that 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.729
 want to accelerate in my case is the god of 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.729
 war 2 and they will give you right mouse click 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:46.310
 and properties then they give you to open 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.380
 location and copy the name of the 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.140
 executable of the game by clicking 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.119
 right mouse and change a man and 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.369
 they copy it and in the text document in 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.869
 where they have the code here in these two 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.240
 commas will paste the name of the 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.460
 game executable but careful friends 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.650
 not going to make the mistake of pasting the 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.110
 name of the executable of your game in 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.670
 all the quotes this will always have 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.890
 to be empty 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.470
 already finished pasting the names of 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.420
 executable of the game you give to file and 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.640
 save as and paste the name of the 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.790
 game executable and will point 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.620
 back and they save it since they have 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.959
 saved they go where they saved it and 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.620
 stay them well and give file 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:31.430
 Right click copy and open the 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:34.280
 location of the game and they will click 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.769
 right mouse and paste and ready ya 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.660
 we end with the first option now 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.790
 finally they give the executable the 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.680
 eye game in this other do not go to 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.080
 wrong and send the other file that 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.090
 we create because that way it will not work well 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.000
 they give the executable right click of the 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.840
 mouse and send to desktop and create 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.069
 direct access and you're ready to look 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.069
 How was the game? 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.250
 good friends now in case you do not 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:06.129
 the first option worked then 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.739
 I believe that this one will serve you the 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:11.230
 second option is placing it in dx9 the 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.060
 direct access of the game in the 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.129
 description of the video I will leave you this 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.859
 another code that is the second option 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:19.900
 to accelerate your good game copy the 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:22.659
 code and they will go to the direct access of the 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.150
 game and they will give you right click of the mouse 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:27.310
 and properties and here where it says 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.650
 destination is the full name of the 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.829
 executable of the god of war 2 and we're going 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.739
 to the last and first we will give a space 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:38.109
 and then we'll paste the friends eye code 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.329
 remember first a space and there yes 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:43.799
 we paste the code that copied that is the 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:43.799
 of x 9 and they give him to apply 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.260
 and then accept and ready your god of war 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.230
 now yes it is fast I will give you some time 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.450
 to try it if does not serve this 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.930
 neither are you calm that are still missing 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:05.870
 two options xddddd good the third is 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.030
 placing a Windows 98 theme or I do not know 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.980
 what the fuck in windows is that but what 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.989
 I know that the subject is horrible but if it is 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.260
 that his game before fast I know that 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:17.530
 you would do anything xdddd will leave 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:21.470
 to the start menu and as a team they will give you 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:23.000
 right mouse click and properties and 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.180
 they get in here where it says 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.220
 advanced configuration of the system and it 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.919
 they put in the option that says performance 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.810
 and by Paul we will appear in this 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:35.840
 option to adjust to get the best 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.400
 appearance and we will give you in this option 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.440
 to adjust to get the least 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.440
 performance and we will give you to apply 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.020
 and finally accept and they will be left 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.630
 your computer at the lowest performance 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.240
 to get more speed in our 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:58.550
 games and when they want to go back to 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.500
 normality to your computer give you the 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.480
 option where was that which is the 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.810
 adjust to higher performance and they give 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.810
 Apply 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:16.770
 and accept and that would be the third 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:18.599
 option now let's go for the last one already if 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.970
 none of the options serves them 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:24.629
 this will be the one that will save them the fichÃ³ 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:26.629
 xdddd will go to the direct access of your 

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:30.060
 game and they will give you right click of the mouse 

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:32.669
 and on properties and they get into 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.860
 compatibility and by default 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:37.379
 this box will be unchecked and with 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:41.370
 this windows xp option in quotation marks 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:44.219
 service pack 3 you check the box and the 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:48.949
 will put in this option windows 98 of 

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:48.949
 to win windows me and give him to apply 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.890
 and finally accept and ready and 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:56.570
 will finally be your good fast game 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.970
