00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:18.529
 Markus Hess vom tells them the free University of Berlin is visiting Strify

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.770
 from the living or too young which, for example, difficult a highlight 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:28.369
 and just not one more that he's a team off the ground this is with 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.970
 Safety upholds that with all the undeniable 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.290

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:46.920
 Markus Hess has been easy with his exercises Leverkusen RPO after that 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:47.510
 St 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.200
 30 percent of it is the create 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.890
 If you do not underestimate the trust of the team 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.510
 is the most important 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.500
 We have shown that you understand each other 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.580

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.259
 It is unbelievable that one of them could bring a future 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.620
 I believed he was a young adult person 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.750
 "He has terrible problems as he was probably too soon 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.670
 laughless but otherwise probably also something really sick 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.440
 they are without it 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.440
 Grass also says that it is something Merkel

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.020
 the book will be more transparent the program 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.520
 fair play all this is a program with the Herbert Scheithauer and his 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.020
 Employee at the free University of Berlin 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.579
 Scheithauer also wants to promote moral courage in adolescents 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:51.820
 Amokläufen under-challenged look it is about it that it is not normal 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.590
 that adolescents give the school 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.210
 experience yourself as a victim 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.590
 and maybe for years, though everyone in the social environment has this 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.990
 Adolescents as different perceive life to themselves without anyone 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.580
 responds to that would be a very good approach and in my opinion 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.669
 To operate prevention 

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:12.489
 also Anton sofie and Anna Lindh belong to the traffic 

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:16.779
 They regularly drive from Berlin to Bremen to meet with students from the seventh

 Class in the school center Findorff rules of the game for the non-violent 

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:22.149

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:25.149
 on the program today a role play 

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:28.159
 from 11 Fri 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:34.739
 three students are waiting at the bus stop for other people to try 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.159
 to scare away their supposed regulars 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.769
 a group jumps the perpetrators aside 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.939
 the others to the victims 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:47.019
 others are watching indefinitely as the situation escalates 

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:49.879
 what was happening 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.849
 what happens to both 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.959
 Anne Lenz intervenes analyzing the conflict 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.139
 Who has what role did it feel and how could one feel in one? 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:03.039
 such situation still behavior 

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:07.489
 important to her is the message that there are not only perpetrators and victims the whole 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.599
 Troops have an influence on what happens, which drives students very often 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:12.539
 border 

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:16.839
 at once people should then come to dilemma situation that one 

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:20.449
 a good one percent longer if I can not beat now and then I'll war 

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:21.789
 maybe something off 

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:24.459
 and then there comes the next step to the years okay what can I do then 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.159
 do not throw me off I'm the hero but as I could 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:28.659
 he 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:30.049
 we drove 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.719
 Mainz would he have woken him up, the young people talk about feelings 

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:37.229
 Rothe the Elbe or Green cards represent the basic mood 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:42.109
 School not only as a place to study but where you feel comfortable approx 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:46.329
 the adolescent comes the concept Anna a thereby one learns still for the 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:49.579
 Judge firmly real life needs so great to see how to behave 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.439
 Best students again the GC you want to hear good 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:54.759
 you go and so on 

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:57.489
 and ask him what's up and stuff 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:59.239
 yes that's on 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.179
 A thick pad still lasts until the afternoon when the play can be lost

 Violence prevention on the sports ground and in the schools 

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:14.929
 Do not look away feeling responsible for everyone in the group 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:18.559
 this is not a panacea against rampages 

00:04:18.559 --> 00:04:20.359
 but also a sequel 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.659
