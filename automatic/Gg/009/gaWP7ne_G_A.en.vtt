got the worst of the arctic blast coming
up<00:00:33.570> but<00:00:33.780> first<00:00:34.050> we're<00:00:34.620> gonna<00:00:34.710> track<00:00:34.980> the

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
up but first we're gonna track the

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.030 
up but first we're gonna track the
potential<00:00:35.430> for<00:00:35.489> rain<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:35.969> thunderstorm<00:00:37.040> take

potential for rain and thunderstorm take

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.979 
potential for rain and thunderstorm take
a<00:00:38.070> look<00:00:38.550> at<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:39.450> who<00:00:39.660> would<00:00:39.809> have<00:00:39.899> thought

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
a look at that who would have thought

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.959 
a look at that who would have thought
snow<00:00:40.350> drifts<00:00:40.920> on<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.160> first<00:00:41.370> day<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:41.640> November

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
snow drifts on the first day of November

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.069 
snow drifts on the first day of November
but<00:00:42.059> that's<00:00:42.210> what<00:00:42.300> we<00:00:42.390> got<00:00:42.540> at<00:00:43.020> least

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
but that's what we got at least

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.350 
but that's what we got at least
temperatures<00:00:43.649> rebounding<00:00:44.579> in<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.760> east<00:00:45.120> so

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
temperatures rebounding in the east so

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.420 
temperatures rebounding in the east so
if<00:00:45.539> you're<00:00:45.660> tired<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.379> cold<00:00:46.530> some<00:00:47.309> more

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
if you're tired of the cold some more

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.680 
if you're tired of the cold some more

in Tampa mid 40s for New Orleans so the

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.490 
in Tampa mid 40s for New Orleans so the
cold<00:00:59.399> was<00:00:59.910> spread<00:01:00.149> all<00:01:00.180> across<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.989> south<00:01:01.260> but

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
cold was spread all across the south but

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.439 
cold was spread all across the south but
as<00:01:01.620> we<00:01:01.739> go<00:01:01.829> into<00:01:01.859> midweek<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.820> Arctic<00:01:03.300> high

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
as we go into midweek that Arctic high

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.420 
as we go into midweek that Arctic high
begins<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.899> slide<00:01:04.170> off<00:01:04.409> towards<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.890> east<00:01:05.100> and

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
begins to slide off towards the east and

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.070 
begins to slide off towards the east and
we<00:01:05.489> will<00:01:05.670> see<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.030> flow<00:01:06.270> return<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.869> more<00:01:06.990> of

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
we will see that flow return to more of

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.960 
we will see that flow return to more of
a<00:01:07.170> southerly<00:01:07.409> flow<00:01:07.680> that's<00:01:08.369> going<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.760> allow

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
a southerly flow that's going to allow

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.880 
a southerly flow that's going to allow
some<00:01:09.240> warmer<00:01:09.630> air<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:10.020> build<00:01:10.140> off<00:01:10.350> towards<00:01:10.799> the

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
some warmer air to build off towards the

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.070 
some warmer air to build off towards the
north<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:11.460> we'll<00:01:11.580> see<00:01:11.729> those<00:01:11.909> highs<00:01:12.180> begin<00:01:12.900> to

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
north so we'll see those highs begin to

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.719 
north so we'll see those highs begin to
rebound<00:01:13.439> actually<00:01:13.890> making<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.220> back<00:01:14.400> closer

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
rebound actually making it back closer

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.090 
rebound actually making it back closer
to<00:01:15.299> average<00:01:15.479> for<00:01:16.140> this<00:01:16.259> time<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.590> year<00:01:16.920> so

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
to average for this time of year so

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.980 
to average for this time of year so
let's<00:01:17.280> talk<00:01:17.580> numbers<00:01:17.970> let's<00:01:18.360> crunch<00:01:18.750> these
