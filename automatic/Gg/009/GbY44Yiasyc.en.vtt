I just wish it was like a roll bond or
something<00:03:17.560> then<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:18.799> next<00:03:18.950> thing<00:03:20.079> which<00:03:21.079> I

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 
something then the next thing which I

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:23.709 
something then the next thing which I
thought<00:03:21.890> was<00:03:22.340> like<00:03:22.760> a<00:03:23.090> first<00:03:23.420> of<00:03:23.569> the<00:03:23.689> line

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:23.719 
thought was like a first of the line

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:30.130 
thought was like a first of the line
thing<00:03:24.530> but<00:03:25.810> anyways<00:03:27.069> maybe<00:03:28.069> they<00:03:29.140> personalize

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
thing but anyways maybe they personalize
