Stewart<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.300> we<00:01:09.450> thought<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.720> was<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.840> really

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
Stewart so we thought that was a really

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.330 
Stewart so we thought that was a really
important<00:01:10.470> part<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.130> Jon<00:01:11.310> Stewart

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340

version of Green Lantern but just for

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.779 
version of Green Lantern but just for
purely<00:01:13.679> for<00:01:13.830> visuals<00:01:14.190> sake<00:01:14.369> we<00:01:14.520> thought<00:01:14.700> we

00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:14.789 
purely for visuals sake we thought we

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:16.249 
purely for visuals sake we thought we
need<00:01:14.940> we<00:01:15.149> needed<00:01:15.300> to<00:01:15.420> give<00:01:15.539> him<00:01:15.690> some<00:01:15.899> kind<00:01:16.140> of

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.040 
need we needed to give him some kind of
visual<00:01:16.619> gimmick<00:01:17.399> for<00:01:17.700> his<00:01:17.820> close-ups<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:18.929> we

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
visual gimmick for his close-ups so we

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.840 
visual gimmick for his close-ups so we
came<00:01:19.140> up<00:01:19.289> with<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.470> idea<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.800> the<00:01:20.310> he's<00:01:20.700> been

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850

helmet shapes I've ever seen in a comic
it<00:02:08.929> was<00:02:09.190> that<00:02:10.190> real<00:02:10.519> good<00:02:10.819> mix<00:02:11.299> of<00:02:11.510> kind<00:02:12.019> of

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:12.579 
it was that real good mix of kind of

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:16.509 
it was that real good mix of kind of
tomboyish<00:02:13.579> but<00:02:14.269> feminine<00:02:15.200> and<00:02:15.500> she<00:02:16.400> was

tomboyish but feminine and she was

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:17.920 
tomboyish but feminine and she was
actually<00:02:16.670> very<00:02:16.819> simple<00:02:17.180> to<00:02:17.269> design<00:02:17.599> I<00:02:17.630> mean<00:02:17.870> I

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
actually very simple to design I mean I

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.089 
actually very simple to design I mean I
basically<00:02:18.049> just<00:02:18.290> just<00:02:18.650> took<00:02:18.769> her<00:02:18.920> right<00:02:19.040> out

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
basically just just took her right out

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.550 
basically just just took her right out
of<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.340> comics<00:02:19.730> and<00:02:20.019> didn't<00:02:21.019> hardly<00:02:21.170> change<00:02:21.440> a

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
of the comics and didn't hardly change a

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.059 
of the comics and didn't hardly change a
thing<00:02:21.769> on<00:02:22.010> her<00:02:23.620> flash<00:02:24.620> was<00:02:24.799> kind<00:02:24.950> of<00:02:24.980> a

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
thing on her flash was kind of a

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.620 
thing on her flash was kind of a
no-brainer<00:02:25.220> designing<00:02:25.940> we<00:02:26.180> knew<00:02:26.299> pretty<00:02:26.480> much

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
no-brainer designing we knew pretty much

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:27.940

right<00:02:26.810> off<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:27.019> bat<00:02:27.140> that<00:02:27.170> we'd<00:02:27.410> pretty<00:02:27.890> much

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
right off the bat that we'd pretty much

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.619 
right off the bat that we'd pretty much
needed<00:02:28.220> to<00:02:28.340> stick<00:02:28.489> to<00:02:28.579> the<00:02:28.670> comic<00:02:29.060> version<00:02:29.239> of
