00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:35.220 
that i've been eating the last what i

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.850 
that i've been eating the last what i
ate<00:00:35.430> in<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.610> day<00:00:36.270> video<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:37.079> i<00:00:37.260> am<00:00:37.590> not<00:00:37.739> the

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
ate in the day video and i am not the

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.700 
ate in the day video and i am not the
type<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.190> person<00:00:38.310> that<00:00:38.700> likes<00:00:38.970> to<00:00:39.290> just<00:00:40.290> share

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
type of person that likes to just share

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.220 
type of person that likes to just share
the<00:00:41.070> same<00:00:41.250> meals<00:00:41.579> all<00:00:42.060> the<00:00:42.360> time<00:00:42.570> with<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.930> I

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
the same meals all the time with you I

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.350 
the same meals all the time with you I
think<00:00:43.620> that's<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:44.460> already<00:00:44.700> got<00:00:44.880> inspiration

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
think that's you already got inspiration

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.080 
think that's you already got inspiration
from<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.140> one<00:00:46.320> time<00:00:46.559> so<00:00:47.040> it's<00:00:47.430> kind<00:00:47.940> of

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
from it one time so it's kind of

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.229 
from it one time so it's kind of
redundant<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.380> keep<00:00:49.559> sharing<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:50.399> know<00:00:50.430> the

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
redundant to keep sharing you know the

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.630 
redundant to keep sharing you know the
same<00:00:51.690> nice<00:00:52.140> cream<00:00:52.500> ones<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.250> same

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
same nice cream ones and the same

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.720 
same nice cream ones and the same
smoothies<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.690> keep<00:00:54.960> making<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:55.680> I<00:00:55.890> just

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
smoothies that I keep making so I just

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.600 
smoothies that I keep making so I just
put<00:00:56.820> together<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.870> little<00:00:58.170> clips<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.800> what<00:00:59.010> I've
