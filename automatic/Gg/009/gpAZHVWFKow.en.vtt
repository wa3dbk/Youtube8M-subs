important<00:00:33.559> aspects<00:00:33.950> of<00:00:34.010> being<00:00:34.190> a<00:00:34.280> good<00:00:34.430> slip

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.660 
important aspects of being a good slip
fielder<00:00:35.410> well<00:00:36.410> I<00:00:36.440> think<00:00:36.559> the<00:00:37.309> ball<00:00:37.460> is<00:00:37.489> going

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
fielder well I think the ball is going

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:38.620 
fielder well I think the ball is going
to<00:00:37.760> be<00:00:37.820> coming<00:00:38.000> at<00:00:38.090> you<00:00:38.150> pretty<00:00:38.300> quick

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:38.630 
to be coming at you pretty quick

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.170 
to be coming at you pretty quick
especially<00:00:39.320> against<00:00:39.739> the<00:00:39.830> Seamas<00:00:40.220> I<00:00:40.430> think

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
especially against the Seamas I think

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.020 
especially against the Seamas I think
you<00:00:41.840> need<00:00:41.989> to<00:00:42.020> have<00:00:42.379> a<00:00:42.410> good<00:00:42.620> base<00:00:42.800> and<00:00:43.640> how<00:00:43.790> why

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
you need to have a good base and how why

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.990 
you need to have a good base and how why
would<00:00:44.239> your<00:00:44.390> base<00:00:44.540> be<00:00:45.340> whatever<00:00:46.340> is<00:00:46.489> comfy<00:00:46.850> -

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
would your base be whatever is comfy -

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.490 
would your base be whatever is comfy -

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.490 
you really were with me it'd be just
just<00:00:49.160> a<00:00:49.629> bit<00:00:50.629> wider<00:00:50.840> than<00:00:51.050> shoulder-width

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
just a bit wider than shoulder-width

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.250 
just a bit wider than shoulder-width
apart<00:00:51.590> yeah<00:00:52.010> I'd<00:00:52.820> stay<00:00:53.120> quite<00:00:53.870> low<00:00:54.050> to<00:00:54.110> the

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
apart yeah I'd stay quite low to the

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.759 
apart yeah I'd stay quite low to the
ground<00:00:54.320> a<00:00:55.540> comfy<00:00:56.540> height<00:00:56.750> whatever<00:00:57.530> feels

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.320 
probably start off coming close catch
him<00:02:08.930> drill<00:02:09.170> where<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.619> feeder<00:02:10.310> is<00:02:10.580> five<00:02:11.000> yards

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
him drill where the feeder is five yards

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.510 
him drill where the feeder is five yards
away<00:02:11.420> you<00:02:11.540> have<00:02:11.780> someone<00:02:12.110> with<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.320> bat

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
away you have someone with the bat

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.470 
away you have someone with the bat
angling<00:02:13.520> the<00:02:13.670> ball<00:02:13.850> toward<00:02:14.180> you

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
angling the ball toward you

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.600 
angling the ball toward you
you'd<00:02:14.990> be<00:02:15.140> a<00:02:15.170> maybe<00:02:15.680> two<00:02:15.920> yards<00:02:16.070> away<00:02:16.280> from<00:02:16.550> the

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
you'd be a maybe two yards away from the

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.100 
you'd be a maybe two yards away from the
bat<00:02:16.790> and<00:02:16.880> it's<00:02:17.000> just<00:02:17.180> about<00:02:17.420> reaction<00:02:17.840> stuff

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
bat and it's just about reaction stuff

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.260 
bat and it's just about reaction stuff
so<00:02:18.260> I<00:02:18.290> guess<00:02:18.470> you<00:02:18.650> you<00:02:19.490> reacted<00:02:19.880> someone's

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
so I guess you you reacted someone's

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.940 
so I guess you you reacted someone's
throwing<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.750> ball<00:02:20.930> at<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.530> bat<00:02:21.710> and<00:02:21.860> he's

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
throwing the ball at the bat and he's

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.200 
throwing the ball at the bat and he's
just<00:02:22.130> deflecting<00:02:22.760> yep

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
just deflecting yep

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.510 
just deflecting yep
a<00:02:23.240> very<00:02:23.960> very<00:02:24.230> close<00:02:24.500> pace<00:02:24.830> just<00:02:24.860> you're

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
a very very close pace just you're

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:34.230 
a very very close pace just you're
reacting<00:02:25.670> just<00:02:26.150> sharpens<00:02:27.050> you<00:02:27.140> up<00:02:31.780> knees<00:02:32.780> bent

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
reacting just sharpens you up knees bent

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.070 
reacting just sharpens you up knees bent
eyes<00:02:35.240> getting<00:02:35.600> close<00:02:35.870> to<00:02:36.080> the<00:02:36.170> ball<00:02:38.080> catch

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
eyes getting close to the ball catch

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.170 
eyes getting close to the ball catch
hands<00:02:39.950> out<00:02:40.070> in<00:02:40.100> front<00:02:40.250> of<00:02:40.520> his<00:02:40.640> knees<00:02:40.880> so<00:02:41.090> they

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
hands out in front of his knees so they

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:50.410 
hands out in front of his knees so they
can<00:02:41.360> move<00:02:47.320> very<00:02:48.320> good<00:02:48.760> another<00:02:49.760> basic<00:02:50.240> catch

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
can move very good another basic catch

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.140 
can move very good another basic catch
and<00:02:50.660> release<00:02:50.920> one<00:02:51.920> of<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.130> many<00:02:52.370> new<00:02:52.760> modern

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
and release one of the many new modern

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.390 
and release one of the many new modern
tech<00:02:53.390> nodes<00:02:53.630> of<00:02:53.780> the<00:02:53.900> game<00:02:54.110> you'll<00:02:55.040> just<00:02:55.190> see

tech nodes of the game you'll just see

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.770 
tech nodes of the game you'll just see
here<00:02:55.610> that<00:02:55.700> I'll<00:02:55.820> just<00:02:56.000> throw<00:02:56.209> the<00:02:56.360> ball<00:02:56.480> onto

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780

the ramp ill deflect you see there's a

enough and caught many many balls so

enough and caught many many balls so

when the opportunity arises they sniffle

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.370 
when the opportunity arises they sniffle
and<00:03:53.790> take<00:03:54.060> every<00:03:54.450> single<00:03:54.780> one<00:03:54.900> because<00:03:55.260> the
