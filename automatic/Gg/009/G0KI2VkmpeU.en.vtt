 dpa 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.600
 48 gets a new episode that Dream Scream Post 

00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:17.919
 This is about Riemer and 200 seas Driburgs 7 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:22.969
 The IFA has a hard drive installed at least one of the big ones 

00:00:22.969 --> 00:00:24.960
 Killer hard drive 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.050
 It's not easy to connect with each other like that from one war fort 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.189
 the other 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.350
 Streamed movies can stream or of course 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.230
 on the other disk on the other turn boxing hard disk 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.620
 built-in is able to record 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:42.840
 that wants to do that 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.880
 hand over one 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.040
 service 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.230
 a firmer service 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.500
 this is the easiest thing to do in my opinion 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.470
 Of course there are other ways, but there are other ways around here 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.380
 installed current percent which after a jump and with the 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.960
 the mini version 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.700
 three games 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.990
 I have to prepare that before, I ask you to do it from now on 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.150
 Honesty in the net you have done with the blue box 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.370
 So-called blue commute will be displayed here 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.980
 if the point settings confirm with OK 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.110
 then he goes to general 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.320
 into gold he all the way down in the survey and wildlife at Rexroth 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.850
 Röttgens use 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.750
 with the horizontal shipping costs 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.030
 by remote control 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.780
 around 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.350
 the setting 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.180
 with the green Castorf with her animal the whole thing 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.640
 and can then switch to AXA 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.040
 races again 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.040
 then retreated significantly from footballs Eckstein 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.680
 then he goes on the menu item add-ons 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.860
 Picture the menu items Mini Dress Life 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.450
 There he could choose to till you 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.810
 For parking the minima a road is also a firmer for the 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.269
 Coolbox called finds 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.309
 he confirms this with the rookie Kassel, then he gets a green party 

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:23.670
 that means that this blog informs the translation 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:28.109
 I could still look around and maybe select other things 

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:32.439
 otherwise you could match with the Greens then 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:36.269
 the installations start the blog into or more victim dance 

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:41.439
 then there is more demand with an overview what fans install everything 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:44.519
 want to confirm that with year 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.099
 and after installation, this is just about as come from the embankment easy 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.099
 to be confirmed with Océ 

00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:56.899
 and now calls you to the CMA 2 has the cool box around 19 states that should 

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:59.889
 which in any case do so the setting will be taken over 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:02.889
 just started with my sister Valemus 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:05.059
 and around 

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:08.629
 has to be reloaded with the relaxed concentration 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:15.199
 because the system reboots first storm gusts stupendous and here on the 

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:18.199
 menu item 

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:21.819
 then there was a new point change at Vesper's 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:26.499
 and in which to be sure in the points 

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:30.159
 the tennis-ass server is running it is on the right and on the left 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:33.159
 Page that the share also runs all 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.419
 Percent of which folder so last men stuck 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.130
 over the Northwest Teens percent on topic below is available 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.400
 that's in the foyer the media today so go the hard drive of the internal 

00:03:47.529 --> 00:03:50.529
 So the internal harddrive Dr 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:53.749
 you can add more stuff to her 

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:56.959
 but that was to me that one left over 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.130
 so after the server is installed 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.790
 and of course we have to run some more on the little box now 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.549
 Make changes 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:09.609
 so the little box can access this share 

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:14.489
 That's best done with the already mentioned ones 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.859
 Partner Deadwood mentioned Rotunda Factor 2 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.520
 So I have chosen here with the FDP on the small box purely 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.509
 logged in and percent of individual offenders have gone to number one and 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:30.520
 we now have her car pure nature part of edits 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.000
 and percent goes out and this line would now have to be added frequently 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.340
 become 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.280
 for a brief explanation 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.120
 Of course, the beginning of the line is a free term taken care of 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.979
 short so not too long so today under what else can imagine 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:52.000
 in this case maybe just the name of the other DreamWorks without a server 

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:53.279
 running 

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:56.759
 then this comes this option switch here they definitely have to 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:58.270
 be registered 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.229
 with a space traffic ip-address 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:03.050
 the server box 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.009
 and there was Inter with a colon 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:08.009
 the corresponding one 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:12.189
 the appropriate release that I'm supposed to murder here is that in the case 

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:17.029
 Iran with the movie ever Bouvier Dr Standard Orden as though on two 

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:19.499
 Legs in the Mur 2 

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:23.889
 so he promptly Schwenninger Neckar and then this these nine points 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:27.109
 Immediately show the value on the hide behind it 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:30.879
 Save the whole with 

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:32.039
 and 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:34.270
 upload again to the box 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.259
 and then you should 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:42.249
 In any case, this small box also once completely provided with this 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.570
 Autonet Wuppertal 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.570
 the settings car of a toccata are loaded 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.960
 when the box comes back it's her hand video trust or the fire 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.260
 Caste that is different from victim families to award 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.979
 individual overview then you see here your normal recorded 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:04.780
 Movies that are flying locally on the hard drive from the cooler where he just has time 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.780
 So in this case, the little box and the gangsters 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.800
 then every third pusher chooses the FPI Fire Brigade Youth Hostel again 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:15.749
 im "I warped this picture 

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:17.979
 then press the menu key 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:21.139
 on the remote then sink this picture 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:24.249
 then you can choose him there to change everything please 

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:27.259
 So the option one in this case 

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:32.279
 and then you move best with the horizontal box 

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:35.279
 "Whenever Teutonia 1 is up 

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:39.810
 So when choosing old building wall mount to Wings then he comes 

00:06:39.809 --> 00:06:42.759
 at the top of the list and okay 

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:47.089
 and that's how they work in the Grütt because we count this overview 

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:52.289
 There he goes to put more pressure and confirms that with Okan 

00:06:53.499 --> 00:06:56.789
 and then the rather Bayern $ 9 point 

00:06:56.789 --> 00:06:58.610
 appear there 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.949
 the very tough translates a test 

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:03.930
 about Sina landline was released at 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:05.389
 and around 

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:09.169
 but I do not want to kick in now, not as a bridge 

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:12.270
 with Océ but just with the green fit 

00:07:13.719 --> 00:07:18.539
 select the fire with the Green Caste this take this entry 

00:07:19.509 --> 00:07:22.639
 then a bookmark is automatically created 

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:26.470
 and we are immediately the recorded movies on the corresponding 

00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:30.589
 therefore grew 

00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:34.360
 so that was embarrassing in one direction the whole thing would have to be done now, of course 

00:07:34.359 --> 00:07:38.529
 So, the local suppliers are taking a different direction at the current 2% 

00:07:39.039 --> 00:07:41.009
 strong checks go 

00:07:41.009 --> 00:07:46.220
 and on the current server OCS he stages who over the above 

00:07:46.219 --> 00:07:48.550
 Author about the location of the daughter part 

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.010
 their release 

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:52.679
 Fazul clock Sonderburgs 

00:07:52.679 --> 00:07:57.389
 and percent good both boxing through and then the hand against Celtic is that 

00:07:57.389 --> 00:07:59.929
 Undergo record cover 

00:07:59.929 --> 00:08:04.219
 so far so good that have been wood I hope that was understandable and the 

00:08:04.219 --> 00:08:07.349
 Reason the whole thing consequences because he is relatively simple 

00:08:07.349 --> 00:08:10.349
 meanwhile protect next place 

00:08:11.879 --> 00:08:13.719
 4 

00:08:13.719 --> 00:08:14.559
 5 because
