probably<00:01:28.530> up<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.710> like<00:01:28.979> 16<00:01:29.520> months<00:01:29.909> so<00:01:30.180> overall

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
probably up to like 16 months so overall

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.819 
probably up to like 16 months so overall
they're<00:01:30.720> just<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.960> really<00:01:31.200> great<00:01:31.290> sippy<00:01:31.650> cup

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
they're just a really great sippy cup

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.469 
they're just a really great sippy cup
even<00:01:32.100> if<00:01:32.340> your<00:01:32.460> child's<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.880> little<00:01:33.060> bit<00:01:33.180> older

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
even if your child's a little bit older

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.420 
even if your child's a little bit older
the<00:01:33.869> next<00:01:34.229> Tommee<00:01:34.439> Tippee<00:01:34.560> sippie's<00:01:35.159> that<00:01:35.340> we

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
the next Tommee Tippee sippie's that we

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.700 
the next Tommee Tippee sippie's that we
got<00:01:35.579> her<00:01:35.820> were<00:01:36.030> these<00:01:36.329> kind<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.200> these<00:01:37.560> are

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
got her were these kind and these are

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.200 
got her were these kind and these are
really<00:01:37.920> cute<00:01:38.189> they<00:01:38.310> have<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.520> little<00:01:38.880> spout

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
really cute they have a little spout

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.690 
really cute they have a little spout
right<00:01:39.540> here<00:01:39.810> on<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.020> top<00:01:40.369> and<00:01:41.369> once<00:01:41.549> again

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
right here on the top and once again

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.149 
right here on the top and once again
it's<00:01:42.390> more<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.720> like<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.930> rubber<00:01:43.320> material<00:01:43.619> this

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
it's more of like a rubber material this

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.770 
it's more of like a rubber material this
one's<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.460> little<00:01:44.579> bit<00:01:44.790> harder<00:01:44.820> just<00:01:45.509> because

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
one's a little bit harder just because

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.780 
one's a little bit harder just because
it's<00:01:46.020> for<00:01:46.200> older<00:01:46.590> kids<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:47.100> believe<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.640> this

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
it's for older kids I believe that this

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.270 
it's for older kids I believe that this
is<00:01:47.850> twelve<00:01:48.570> months<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.110> up<00:01:49.320> gets<00:01:49.860> them<00:01:50.040> more

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
is twelve months and up gets them more

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.300 
is twelve months and up gets them more
used<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.820> drinking<00:01:51.509> from<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.930> cop<00:01:52.229> versus<00:01:52.890> more

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
used to drinking from a cop versus more

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.880 
used to drinking from a cop versus more
of<00:01:53.430> like<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.790> spout<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.630> it's<00:01:55.470> just<00:01:55.649> overall

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
of like a spout and it's just overall

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.889 
of like a spout and it's just overall
this<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.189> just<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.549> really<00:01:56.729> great<00:01:56.939> sippy<00:01:57.780> as

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
this is just a really great sippy as

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.480 
this is just a really great sippy as
well<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.409> she<00:01:58.530> really<00:01:58.799> likes<00:01:59.009> this<00:01:59.250> the

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
well and she really likes this the

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.249 
well and she really likes this the
transition<00:02:00.030> from<00:02:00.240> her<00:02:00.360> little<00:02:00.630> sippy<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.110> this

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
transition from her little sippy to this

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.620 
transition from her little sippy to this
one<00:02:01.500> was<00:02:01.710> super<00:02:01.920> flawless<00:02:02.610> she<00:02:03.180> took<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.509> it

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
one was super flawless she took to it

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.030 
one was super flawless she took to it
right<00:02:03.810> away<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:04.350> think<00:02:04.560> it's<00:02:04.649> because<00:02:04.890> it's

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
right away and I think it's because it's

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.920 
right away and I think it's because it's
got<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.250> similar<00:02:05.670> texture<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.750> the

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
got a similar texture to it and the

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.389 
got a similar texture to it and the
colors<00:02:07.259> are<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.560> same<00:02:07.740> as<00:02:07.920> well

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
colors are the same as well

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.369 
colors are the same as well
another<00:02:09.000> really<00:02:09.239> nice<00:02:09.479> thing<00:02:09.539> about<00:02:09.780> this<00:02:10.019> is

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
another really nice thing about this is

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.789 
another really nice thing about this is
it<00:02:10.560> has<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.890> exact<00:02:11.310> same<00:02:11.430> insert<00:02:12.150> in<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:12.540> as

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:12.799 
it has the exact same insert in it as

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:16.009 
it has the exact same insert in it as
this<00:02:13.799> one<00:02:14.220> does<00:02:14.489> so<00:02:15.209> when<00:02:15.480> you're<00:02:15.599> done<00:02:15.780> with<00:02:15.840> a

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
this one does so when you're done with a

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.110 
this one does so when you're done with a
smaller<00:02:16.379> Sippy<00:02:16.799> you<00:02:16.950> can<00:02:17.159> keep<00:02:17.400> these<00:02:17.610> inserts

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
smaller Sippy you can keep these inserts

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.820 
smaller Sippy you can keep these inserts
and<00:02:18.360> use<00:02:18.480> them<00:02:18.690> for<00:02:18.720> your<00:02:19.049> bigger<00:02:19.230> ones<00:02:19.530> in

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
and use them for your bigger ones in

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.369 
and use them for your bigger ones in
case<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.190> lose<00:02:20.459> one<00:02:20.760> or<00:02:21.090> you<00:02:21.810> have<00:02:22.019> a<00:02:22.049> couple

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
case you lose one or you have a couple

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:23.660 
case you lose one or you have a couple
in<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.650> dishwasher<00:02:23.099> they<00:02:23.250> haven't<00:02:23.519> gotten

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
in the dishwasher they haven't gotten

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.550 
in the dishwasher they haven't gotten
cleaned<00:02:24.090> yet<00:02:24.360> it's<00:02:24.840> really<00:02:25.140> nice<00:02:25.319> because

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
cleaned yet it's really nice because

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.020 
cleaned yet it's really nice because
they're<00:02:25.739> interchangeable<00:02:26.489> and<00:02:26.670> they're<00:02:26.909> the

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
they're interchangeable and they're the

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.850 
they're interchangeable and they're the
exact<00:02:27.329> same<00:02:27.510> thing<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:28.079> then<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.260> last<00:02:28.440> Sippy

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
exact same thing and then the last Sippy

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.619 
exact same thing and then the last Sippy
that<00:02:29.010> we<00:02:29.129> have<00:02:29.310> for<00:02:29.489> her<00:02:29.519> is<00:02:29.849> really<00:02:30.450> nice

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
that we have for her is really nice

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.160 
that we have for her is really nice
because<00:02:31.079> it<00:02:31.349> is<00:02:31.409> a<00:02:31.590> straw<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.730> this<00:02:33.569> one<00:02:33.870> is

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
because it is a straw and this one is

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.530 
because it is a straw and this one is
probably<00:02:34.500> a<00:02:34.829> little<00:02:35.069> bit<00:02:35.250> for<00:02:35.519> more<00:02:35.909> of<00:02:36.090> older

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
probably a little bit for more of older

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.479 
probably a little bit for more of older
children<00:02:37.019> but<00:02:37.470> it's<00:02:37.650> nice<00:02:37.829> because<00:02:38.099> I<00:02:38.250> wanted

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
children but it's nice because I wanted

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.759 
children but it's nice because I wanted
to<00:02:38.640> get<00:02:38.790> her<00:02:39.000> this<00:02:39.540> cup<00:02:39.900> that<00:02:40.140> had<00:02:40.290> more<00:02:40.470> of<00:02:40.650> the

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
to get her this cup that had more of the

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.380 
to get her this cup that had more of the
cup<00:02:41.010> spout<00:02:41.340> so<00:02:41.640> she<00:02:41.700> could<00:02:41.970> get<00:02:42.090> used<00:02:42.269> to

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
cup spout so she could get used to

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.569 
cup spout so she could get used to
drinking<00:02:42.599> more<00:02:42.930> from<00:02:43.140> like<00:02:43.290> a<00:02:43.319> cup<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:44.010> this

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
drinking more from like a cup and this

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.309 
drinking more from like a cup and this
one's<00:02:44.879> nice<00:02:45.120> because<00:02:45.150> she<00:02:45.780> can<00:02:45.930> get<00:02:46.049> used<00:02:46.260> to

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
one's nice because she can get used to

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:47.990 
one's nice because she can get used to
drinking<00:02:46.650> more<00:02:46.769> from<00:02:46.980> a<00:02:47.069> straw<00:02:47.370> now<00:02:47.640> the

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
drinking more from a straw now the

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.270 
drinking more from a straw now the
suction<00:02:48.480> on<00:02:48.599> this<00:02:48.870> is<00:02:49.140> a<00:02:49.590> lot<00:02:49.890> better<00:02:50.160> than

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
suction on this is a lot better than

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.550 
suction on this is a lot better than
like<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:50.790> normal<00:02:51.180> straw<00:02:51.510> because<00:02:52.019> it<00:02:52.200> actually

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
like a normal straw because it actually

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.470 
like a normal straw because it actually
doesn't<00:02:52.739> flow<00:02:53.190> quite<00:02:53.579> as<00:02:53.760> fast<00:02:54.060> so<00:02:54.359> it

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
doesn't flow quite as fast so it

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.569 
doesn't flow quite as fast so it
prevents<00:02:54.959> leaking<00:02:55.440> and<00:02:55.769> it's<00:02:56.159> nice<00:02:56.370> because

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
prevents leaking and it's nice because

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.460 
prevents leaking and it's nice because
you<00:02:56.790> just<00:02:57.000> shut<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.599> lid<00:02:57.810> when<00:02:58.079> you're<00:02:58.260> done

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
you just shut the lid when you're done
