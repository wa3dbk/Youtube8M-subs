00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
out and let's grab a torch okay so now

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.570 
out and let's grab a torch okay so now
you're<00:01:12.900> gonna<00:01:12.960> want<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.229> dig<00:01:13.560> one<00:01:13.770> down<00:01:13.920> stick

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
you're gonna want to dig one down stick

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.940 
you're gonna want to dig one down stick
a<00:01:14.610> sticky<00:01:14.970> piston<00:01:15.150> stick<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.810> sticky<00:01:16.380> piston<00:01:16.560> oh

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
a sticky piston stick a sticky piston oh

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.999 
a sticky piston stick a sticky piston oh
no<00:01:17.460> make<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:17.880> facing<00:01:18.180> out<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.229> go<00:01:19.470> sticky

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
no make it facing out and you go sticky

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.350 
no make it facing out and you go sticky
piston<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.520> then<00:01:20.700> put<00:01:20.880> some<00:01:21.060> more<00:01:21.119> blocks

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
piston and then put some more blocks

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.810 
piston and then put some more blocks
right<00:01:21.509> there<00:01:21.750> take<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.650> whole<00:01:22.920> two<00:01:23.159> down<00:01:23.369> put<00:01:23.790> a

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
right there take a whole two down put a

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.640 
right there take a whole two down put a
block<00:01:24.090> right<00:01:24.330> here<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.810> that's<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.290> basic

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
block right here and that's the basic

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.380 
block right here and that's the basic
layout<00:01:26.070> for<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:26.729> now<00:01:26.820> for<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.060> wiring

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
layout for it so now for the wiring

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.359 
layout for it so now for the wiring
redstone<00:01:28.110> torch<00:01:28.380> right<00:01:28.590> next<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.070> block

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
redstone torch right next to this block

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.280 
redstone torch right next to this block
they<00:01:29.729> could<00:01:29.909> go<00:01:30.000> over<00:01:30.180> here<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.689> make<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.170> so

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
they could go over here and make it so

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.350 
they could go over here and make it so
that<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.530> hooks<00:01:31.740> up<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:31.950> these<00:01:32.220> Pistons<00:01:33.180> here

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
that it hooks up to these Pistons here

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.630 
that it hooks up to these Pistons here
now<00:01:34.049> last<00:01:34.320> thing<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.500> gotta<00:01:34.650> do<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:35.040> put<00:01:35.400> some

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
now last thing you gotta do is put some

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.480 
now last thing you gotta do is put some
water<00:01:35.880> right<00:01:36.360> in<00:01:36.570> here<00:01:36.750> so<00:01:37.290> here<00:01:37.500> we<00:01:37.560> go<00:01:37.590> looks

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
water right in here so here we go looks

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.420 
water right in here so here we go looks
pretty<00:01:38.610> much<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.030> same<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.590> think<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:40.740> let's
