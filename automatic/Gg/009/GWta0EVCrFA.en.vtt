00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.359
 Thanks for that, I love the sly myself 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.610
 cooper games already on the 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.680
 Playstation 2 I have all three games 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.329
 but she only got obsessed on the 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.340
 playstation 3 with the help of hd 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.829

 Collection really recommend to anyone 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.809
 even a little something with 3d jump &amp; 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:58.170
 starting runs can be a must have 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:01:00.210
 for genre fans at sly cooper hunt through 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.309
 the time is the fourth 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.989
 Part of the sly cooper series 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.240
 the game is a complete one 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.580
 We were redesigned by san siro 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.350
 games is not developed by sucker punch 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.960
 These are the infamous series for this 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.390
 responsible during his star games 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.619
 also for the sly cooper hd collection 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.909
 were responsible 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:23.700
 The game was on 6 June 2011 on Sony's 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.820
 e3 conference announced and released 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.040
 finally on 28 march 2013 with us 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.780
 the great thing about the game supports 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.400
 the cross at function 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.439
 that means you buy it on the 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.740
 Playstation 3 can do it, too 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.939
 at the same time on his playstation vita 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.670
 Download and so on the go 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.439
 play the scores can be 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.329
 conveniently store in the cloud and 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.549
 Get a very cool feature soup 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.350
 you could play two identical games 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.549
 two different systems for a price 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.549
 from a real top 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:02.750
 sly cooper hunt closes by the time 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.399
 seamlessly on the third part at two and 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.179
 his gang have actually become 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.520
 rested 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:09.349
 only the turtle bentley is still working on it 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.799
 now and then to various toys 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.650
 around 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:14.629
 He also noticed that some pages 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.060
 from the famous book of the masters love 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:17.930
 that you are in part one together 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.230
 disappear 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.670
 our slice ancestors are in danger 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.410
 immediately the band drums the whole 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.140
 Assembling gear again 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.209
 Make time machine and the three friends 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.739
 in the past to 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.470
 look what with two coopers 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.030
 Relationships happened so back 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.489
 in the five different epochs of time 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.200
 but the friends realize that they 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.000
 not the only ones out of the 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.640
 the whole future has come 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.099
 story begins this is the 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.989
 funny cartoon sequences tells 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.609
 is the narrative directly from the 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.750
 predecessors have been taken I think 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:53.269
 a top decision 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.950
 In addition, you will be offered a super humor 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.420
 Unfortunately, history is also here 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.430
 simply a means to an end 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.769
 sometimes a bit confused when going ahead 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.670
 everything the predecessor does not know but the 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.480
 history is yes at 3d jump'n'run 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.260
 expediently you just have a look 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.260
 made examples 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:15.440
 but we finally found him 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:16.940
 We discovered him in prison at 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.950
 gameplay has become the developers in 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.080
 old strengths oriented and these with 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.760
 new ideas added here visited how 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.680
 already mentioned five different 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.170
 epochs such as the feudal one 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.989
 Japan the wild west or one 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.120
 medieval england each of these 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.579
 epochen represents a single big one 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.260
 coherent level where 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:36.739
 different tasks done 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.629
 become 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.690
 throughout the game you take over the 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:44.660
 control over all three members of the 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.910
 slang so super is the all-rounder with 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.560
 he might sneak steal jump 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.090
 fight and different costumes 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.819
 put on you again special 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.950
 turtle lend skills 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.799
 bentley is Prince hedges because the chop 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.299
 consists of three mini games where you 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.459
 prove your skill 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:03.470
 on the one hand, the game is developing 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.329
 a cheap shooter or one 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.549
 shoot 'em up which I super great funny 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:09.470
 only find that third mini game where you 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:11.810
 steer a ball through a labyrinth 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:15.200
 should not be quite so successful though 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.269
 We will come later to MÃ¶hring 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.320
 is therefore suitable for fighting here and 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.389
 but there could also be diverse with them 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.799
 mini games play in that he is the 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:24.530
 strongest is he has also on 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.900
 The strongest weekly results are also the 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.900
 respective ancestors of sly playable 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.389
 For example, you are in Japan Richie 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.490
 Cuba on the road or in the wild west as 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:36.440
 tennessee kit cooper that's pretty 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.880
 cool because each of these ancestors 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.000
 different skills with it 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.430
 brings and so again that I already 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.050
 enriched with varied gameplay 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.330
 in general, the huge strength of the 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.840
 play the diversion during the game 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:52.280
 you have different tasks 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.190
 approaches and abilities so that 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.320
 absolutely no boredom arise besides 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.780
 can even new moves through 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.120
 Buy your coins in the respective ones 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.789
 Level collects he collects track is so 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.530
 Definitely rewarded per epoch here 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:08.780
 the different characters even 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.669
 several times so that was only after 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.039
 two to three hours the remote 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:15.229
 of each level should be defeated 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:17.570
 These are all imposing in scene 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:19.219
 set and are also pretty crisp up 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.910
 to at least the reasonable needs because 

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:22.430
 that 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.020
 China finds out the game shines 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.390
 through a very good control me 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:29.270
 seemed a bit more direct than even 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:31.580
 at 2 1 and 2 only with the motion 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.900
 Control the x6 of the controller could 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.760
 I do not make friends 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.980
 some dates games like 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.650
 example of one of the hack games with 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.630
 Gasoline must be handled this way 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.640
 Do you have the controller in the 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.590
 respective direction move something for me 

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:48.050
 a little stale acts around the 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:49.760
 Playstation 3 release became some 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.590
 play with the motion control 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.360
 fitted 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.650
 But in 2013 this is long forgotten 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.300
 therefore i can not make the decision 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.040
 quite understand why you put them in 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.210
 a game like sly cooper hunting through 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.920
 reinstall the time 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.800
 otherwise there is nothing to 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:06.350
 complain the gameplay is quite whole 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.720
 quite a big plus point of the game 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.790
 absolutely well done varied 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.670
 and that over the entire playing time no 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:19.150
 only a minute boredom can arise 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:19.150
 so 3d must be relevant top 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.810
 graphically we became a very beautiful 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.700
 comic look offered 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.440
 the representation of the characters is now 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.760
 know angular but that's what you wanted 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.320
 because that too earlier in the others 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.810
 Play was the case and perfect for 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.910
 series alone fits the first world 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.920
 Japan is really wonderful in scene 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:45.800
 set looks simply incredible 

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.480
 good on top of that comes a great opponent 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.850
 design what me now and then 

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.740
 could elicit a smile here and there 

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:53.180
 we have two unsightly textures though 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.670
 this is just a marginal phenomenon 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:58.100
 in an otherwise graphic wonderful 

00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:00.170
 Gesamtbild We are also synonymous with top 

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.940
 animations make the game more enjoyable 

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:04.190
 lifelike 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:06.110
 There are ingenious German spokesman 

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.180
 was an atmospheric soundtrack 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:10.670
 Also suitable sound effects can be found 

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:12.740
 at sly cooper hunting by the time 

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:16.070
 only what I had to complain about here 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:18.260
 The loading time is some of the loading times 

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:20.360
 are longer than one is dear and 

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:23.020
 break through here and there otherwise 

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.020
 good game flow 

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:32.990
 we come to the conclusion the game awakens 

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:35.090
 memories of the good old times it 

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:37.850
 is again a top jump'n'run after 

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:39.170
 long long time and sly cooper hunting 

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:40.040
 through time is a worthy one 

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:42.320
 successor 

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:44.300
 it offers us varied 

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.370
 Gameplay paired with funny ideas 

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:49.100
 charming characters and a colorful 

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:51.260
 presentation a game that shows how good 

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:53.330
 Therefore, 3d platformers can be 

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:55.700
 I recommend the game every job in oran 

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:58.070
 fan-block goes through the internet in the 

00:07:55.700 --> 00:08:01.270
 load next video game and buy yourself 

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:01.270
 the game is worth it
