00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:13.730
 hyde together i have the msrt 72 here 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:18.470
 latest gaming notebook from msi already 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:21.410
 with the brand new nvidia geforce gtx 89 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.750
 m with a full 8 gigabyte gddr5 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.060
 graphics memory so neat g-power 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.950
 here in the device that only briefly with 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.250
 would like to show 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:34.010
 we still have 147 10 hq processor 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:37.449
 we now have 16 gb here in the model 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:41.960
 Operative memory who with 256 gb ssd 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:44.870
 memory not only 256 gb 2 x 128 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.670
 gb in raid 0 verbund so just 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.499
 Accordingly, you very quickly 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.089
 system 

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:52.190
 and yes there is only we just briefly 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:54.170
 Take a look at the connections 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.589
 and maybe the dishes are here 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.899
 almost four kilos almost and yes so we 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:02.030
 are difficult here with the camera like that 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.400
 let's catch the sd-card slot ourselves 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.320
 have four audio connections in total 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.090
 say up to eight channels could be here 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.350
 Of course you can just spend one 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.110
 connect headset microphone 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:18.140
 all you want to do you have usb four times 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:20.030
 3.0 connections I say then on the 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.950
 back it goes straight on 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.259
 join me once the 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.060
 electricity connection speak last connection 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.820
 once a lan connection also 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.899
 gigabit lan of course hdmi and two times 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.180
 displayport so you can here 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:34.490
 a total of three monitors in parallel 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.659
 but also close two and that 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.409
 continue to use notebook display 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.609
 we wanted here by side once the 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.159
 kensington lock and here we have it 

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:45.020
 big air outlet system so that the 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:49.219
 Air outlet The cooling system is on 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.469
 both sides in the case then on the 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:52.939
 on the right side we have two more usb 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:53.509
 3.0 connections say six pieces 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.820
 a total of 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.159
 And everyone still the drive that works 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.020
 just from normal dvd drive up 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.479
 everything is in the blu ray burner 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.130
 series represented 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.710
 and look again at the bottom 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.840
 you see 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.819
 the bottom is basically complete 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.470
 open so here in the middle that is 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.060
 all air intake for the cooling system in the 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.250
 to get the components next to cold 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.200
 and works very well for the first 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.430
 but test to make more later 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.610
 first of course, then more at 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.940
 our blog creation of audio 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.310
 system so neatly packed that 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.780
 good piece maybe also forward 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.640
 for them who stand on lighting 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.160
 you have left and right but led 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.780
 light the lights next to it in the device 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.090
 different and here of course after 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.660
 status leds directly above it so that you 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.739
 See what the device is doing right now 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.810
 look at the whole is sometimes from 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.310
 inside on 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.230
 because of course we have those here again 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.540
 typical or usual with msr 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.040
 steelseries keyboard speak gaming 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:55.100
 keyboard extra for socks and so on 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.260
 aligned the whole lit up too 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.390
 600 also lit in total 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.459
 divided into three zones you can get the 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.950
 define colors and thus so on because 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.140
 I think something for everyone 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:10.049
 huge touchpad here too 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:13.200
 also flush with the housing so none 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.790
 knew or similar in there can one 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.640
 be a bit irritating but im 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.989
 principle not wrong 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.519
 two separate mouse buttons but not 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.750
 integrated I personally found very 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:29.540
 nice because I prefer the individual 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:29.540
 buttons on the slovakia are beautifully illuminated and 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.680
 and yes the nice touchpad is too 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:36.660
 as soon as you raise a mouse via usb 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.220
 automatically goes almost completely off so 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.489
 had to convert extra but mouse 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.290
 then falls out but probably the 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.079
 other side still the usual buttons 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.959
 we once have the power button now 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:52.829
 finally 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:53.489
 he just does not want to be any closer 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.190
 button 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.989
 Here you have the gaming profile could 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.790
 set here 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:01.230
 So say if now a sport mode 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.180
 want to go where the system as powerful 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.810
 on full power always runs no matter what 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:09.170
 you do or run in eco mode 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:12.709
 o mode and so on the power books 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:16.579
 the cooler boost that's just what 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:17.690
 a system around in doubt fan again 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.889
 turn higher for example on 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.959
 the lan party or if you have to now 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:22.700
 has quite longer just told to cool 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.830
 Press bus to turn on the fan 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.560
 Full performance is what you get 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.150
 a little colder here is user ran 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.650
 me the whole yes the taste here 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.410
 you prove yourself about the software 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.720
 is pre-installed and here you come in 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.910
 that of the us-menu just around the keyboard 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.919
 to set up with which colors on the 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.169
 Whatever light up, yes, yes 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:45.610
 The color should change through can 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:48.130
 you completely set yourself up 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.660
 then we let's see the display so 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:53.060
 before that you go up here once 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.130
 also partly air intakes for 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.750
 other part speaker systems young 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.460
 and the sound goes straight to you 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.889
 of course, too, is already addressed 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.030
 not bad 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:04.820
 and then look at the display 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.500
 we have here 17 3 inch display full HD 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.590
 and that makes it all in dull, too 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.390
 execution and also with nice big ones 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.950
 viewpoints so the only one is 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.570
 but really from below you can see it 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.270
 maybe here a bit that 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:21.880
 the colors get pretty dark and 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.880
 otherwise webcam is still up here 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.610
 the webcam in it 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.669
 two microphones just yet 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.439
 in stereo video calling so use 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:34.080
 that in any case already done nicely 

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:35.400
 and the display as I said a bit 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.229
 peeping from below it, there is a 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.669
 a bit bad but at least the 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:43.110
 lateral viewing angles are very stable 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:47.430
 and you can be good in any case 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:49.080
 especially good on performance 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.909
 the equal opportunity briefly on we 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:54.449
 this current play beats and 

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:59.159
 I'll say sorry until it goes along 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:06:00.990
 our msa gt 72 and I have ten times 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:02.699
 Just know three started around you 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:05.520
 sometimes they could show how he felt then 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:07.289
 even current titles beats before we 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.680
 Let's start with the option 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:12.840
 chance to briefly adjust the settings 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:17.870
 How is everything in principle now 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:20.099
 of course polar dvd is active and 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:22.349
 of course here in the graphic 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:25.879
 Settings is completely up 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:28.460
 maximum turned what is there so here 

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:30.990
 if I do not care if it's the Scots 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.599
 Qualities so everything on maximum what 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.190
 somehow possible 

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:37.229
 good chance all the time I take 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:39.060
 now as usual our the 

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:41.039
 entrance scene im due to the many 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:45.389
 effects but sometimes to look 

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:47.669
 who beats it like that and whether you 

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:53.690
 just like fmc the top in the corner 

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:53.690
 and then we look at 10 o'clock 

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:07.720
 over 30 fps in any case still in the 

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:12.340
 fluid areas well playable 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:18.220
 range so no problem should be 

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:19.960
 all the highest level here 

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.430
 now times to effects wassum game 

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:24.700
 will continue to do so later in the game 

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:26.110
 does not come as much progress as effects 

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:29.710
 right here in the beginning 

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:33.180
 scene beginning scene no matter with the fire 

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:33.180
 and everything a little bit more pure 

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:39.670
 with explosions is always over 30 

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:41.820
 that is not all at all 

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:41.820
 problem 

00:07:52.009 --> 00:07:57.469
 So it really works very smoothly 

00:07:54.469 --> 00:07:58.689
 You can not do anything without problems 

00:07:57.469 --> 00:08:01.309
 say also during the explosions 

00:07:58.689 --> 00:08:03.559
 Video sequences will all be up and running 

00:08:01.309 --> 00:08:06.469
 definitely super on ultra too 

00:08:03.559 --> 00:08:08.029
 attitudes to full hd etc so that 

00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:09.979
 should not be a problem for 

00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:11.990
 notebook bavaria we really talk here 

00:08:09.979 --> 00:08:15.409
 already over the upper class in general 

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:18.020
 start burgherr well so then fell short 

00:08:15.409 --> 00:08:20.289
 to the gaming bathroom and then to the next 

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.289
 times
