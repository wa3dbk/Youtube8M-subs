00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.080
 you could even 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.290
 to see, I think I say the first 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.560
 elections I was only last year 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.560
 but 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.640
 of the digestives and so but good 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:44.980
 finished 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.930
 to the fear that the heat left us 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.649
 temperatures that there was this year is going to be 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.649
 the same but 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.899
 one thing that means that work 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:03.019
 here on the island is growing that to the 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:06.470
 people like it and you see that all 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:08.479
 runners not only those from Spain 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.070
 those on the islands have but everything 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.550
 the world I think it's a very 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.420
 good for 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:18.420
 for the race for the island also and 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.840
 Well the truth is that I'm going over 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.920
 rookie completely and then either 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.810
 I can say that I have a strategy or 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.810
 that I thought about how I'm going to run 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.220
 because good sport if without having 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.240
 no one I think I think is 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.119
 foolishness think about making a way other 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.570
 On the beach of Tazacorte comes what is 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:41.290
 the via crucis is not about 6 km that you 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.330
 I die I did not expect life 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:49.039
 straight from the settlers on the left and 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:51.429
 then the rise that needs to be prepared and 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:53.960
 people are teaching me how to walk 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:56.330
 negotiations and puts one foot in front of 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.960
 another pretty there are hatreds and we must teach 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.960
 to all 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.980
 by we also feel and clear 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.489
 you have to be aware of our 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.489
 possibilities 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.360
 the coconut 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.040
 to me 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.890
 Y 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.070
 to me 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:46.629
