00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.540 
first year and you think oh no I haven't
chosen<00:00:48.289> to<00:00:48.530> that<00:00:48.649> course<00:00:48.890> I<00:00:49.039> didn't<00:00:49.460> do<00:00:49.520> that

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
chosen to that course I didn't do that

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.250 
chosen to that course I didn't do that
from<00:00:49.789> day<00:00:49.969> one<00:00:50.000> especially<00:00:50.719> they<00:00:50.870> knew<00:00:51.109> where

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
from day one especially they knew where

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.139 
from day one especially they knew where
you<00:00:51.350> can<00:00:51.469> transfer<00:00:51.859> so<00:00:52.190> easily<00:00:52.399> yeah<00:00:53.030> it's

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
you can transfer so easily yeah it's

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:53.920 
you can transfer so easily yeah it's
like<00:00:53.239> you<00:00:53.329> don't<00:00:53.510> have<00:00:53.570> to<00:00:53.690> make<00:00:53.840> this

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
like you don't have to make this

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.439 
like you don't have to make this
life-changing<00:00:54.649> decision<00:00:55.070> at<00:00:55.309> 17<00:00:55.910> moving<00:00:56.359> away

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
life-changing decision at 17 moving away

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:58.209 
life-changing decision at 17 moving away
from<00:00:56.539> home<00:00:56.809> and<00:00:57.109> a<00:00:57.260> lot<00:00:57.469> of<00:00:57.559> degrees<00:00:57.829> they<00:00:58.160> do

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
from home and a lot of degrees they do

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.130 
from home and a lot of degrees they do
have<00:00:58.489> a<00:00:58.519> very<00:00:58.820> common<00:00:59.210> first<00:00:59.480> year<00:00:59.750> and<00:00:59.930> then

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
have a very common first year and then

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.450 
have a very common first year and then
you<00:01:00.320> specialize<00:01:00.829> which<00:01:01.010> i<00:01:01.070> think<00:01:01.129> is<00:01:01.340> really

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
you specialize which i think is really

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.600 
you specialize which i think is really
good<00:01:01.730> because<00:01:01.940> like<00:01:02.809> when<00:01:03.289> I<00:01:03.320> left<00:01:04.010> home<00:01:04.220> I<00:01:04.430> was

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
good because like when I left home I was

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:05.770 
good because like when I left home I was
like<00:01:04.790> I<00:01:04.940> want<00:01:05.090> to<00:01:05.120> be<00:01:05.210> a<00:01:05.239> mechanical<00:01:05.720> engineer

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
like I want to be a mechanical engineer

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.530 
like I want to be a mechanical engineer
my<00:01:06.380> engineering<00:01:07.310> sounds<00:01:07.610> good<00:01:07.820> like<00:01:08.299> that

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
my engineering sounds good like that

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.870 
my engineering sounds good like that
general<00:01:08.900> area<00:01:09.110> and<00:01:09.680> so<00:01:10.040> yeah<00:01:10.220> coming<00:01:10.520> to<00:01:10.640> India

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
general area and so yeah coming to India

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.850 
general area and so yeah coming to India
is<00:01:10.939> really<00:01:11.210> given<00:01:11.509> me<00:01:12.080> the<00:01:12.229> opportunity<00:01:12.740> to

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
is really given me the opportunity to

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.770 
is really given me the opportunity to
explore<00:01:13.159> what<00:01:13.340> I<00:01:13.369> like<00:01:13.610> and<00:01:13.880> then<00:01:14.119> go<00:01:14.390> down

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
explore what I like and then go down

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.330 
explore what I like and then go down
that<00:01:14.990> path<00:01:15.229> instead<00:01:15.710> of<00:01:15.799> being<00:01:16.009> locked<00:01:16.100> into

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
that path instead of being locked into

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.740 
that path instead of being locked into
something<00:01:16.610> that<00:01:16.909> I<00:01:17.090> wasn't<00:01:17.240> passionate<00:01:17.479> about

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
something that I wasn't passionate about

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.510 
something that I wasn't passionate about
or<00:01:18.049> that<00:01:18.259> I<00:01:18.290> wasn't<00:01:18.470> interested<00:01:18.740> in<00:01:19.009> but<00:01:19.310> still

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
or that I wasn't interested in but still

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.670 
or that I wasn't interested in but still
had<00:01:19.670> to<00:01:19.759> do<00:01:19.880> anyway<00:01:20.320> one<00:01:21.320> other<00:01:21.500> piece<00:01:21.650> of

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
had to do anyway one other piece of

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.130 
had to do anyway one other piece of
advice<00:01:21.799> I'd<00:01:22.159> probably<00:01:22.759> add<00:01:23.150> is<00:01:23.509> get<00:01:23.720> involved

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
advice I'd probably add is get involved

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.469 
advice I'd probably add is get involved
in<00:01:24.259> as<00:01:24.350> much<00:01:24.470> as<00:01:24.530> you<00:01:24.650> can<00:01:24.829> and<00:01:25.150> kind<00:01:26.150> of<00:01:26.270> step

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
out of your comfort zone a little bit

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.830 
out of your comfort zone a little bit
it<00:01:27.770> can<00:01:28.040> help<00:01:28.400> you<00:01:28.729> personally<00:01:29.299> develop<00:01:29.659> so

it can help you personally develop so
much<00:01:29.960> more<00:01:30.229> but<00:01:30.439> also<00:01:30.619> like<00:01:30.860> your<00:01:31.040> meet<00:01:31.189> people

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
and you never know that might help you

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.569 
and you never know that might help you
discover<00:01:33.140> a<00:01:33.259> field<00:01:33.590> where<00:01:33.740> you<00:01:33.799> want<00:01:33.920> to<00:01:34.009> go<00:01:34.280> or

discover a field where you want to go or

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:36.550 
discover a field where you want to go or
it<00:01:34.970> might<00:01:35.149> even<00:01:35.450> just<00:01:35.600> clarify<00:01:36.049> what<00:01:36.350> you<00:01:36.380> want

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
it might even just clarify what you want

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.359 
it might even just clarify what you want
to<00:01:36.619> do<00:01:36.680> with<00:01:36.770> your<00:01:36.890> life<00:01:37.040> so<00:01:37.070> I<00:01:37.280> think

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
to do with your life so I think

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.580 
to do with your life so I think
ultimately<00:01:37.640> just<00:01:38.240> get<00:01:38.899> involved<00:01:39.079> and<00:01:39.290> enjoy

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
ultimately just get involved and enjoy

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:40.120 
ultimately just get involved and enjoy
it<00:01:39.710> while<00:01:39.829> you<00:01:39.920> can

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
it while you can

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.859 
it while you can
it's<00:01:40.850> really<00:01:41.060> important<00:01:41.479> to<00:01:41.540> remember<00:01:41.630> that

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
it's really important to remember that

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.840 
it's really important to remember that
universities<00:01:42.799> not<00:01:42.979> just<00:01:43.189> about<00:01:43.579> studying

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
universities not just about studying

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.789 
universities not just about studying

helps to get between classes a bit

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.089 
helps to get between classes a bit
quicker<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.289> that's<00:02:10.379> kind<00:02:10.649> of<00:02:10.709> stuff<00:02:10.860> and

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
quicker and that's kind of stuff and

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.160 
quicker and that's kind of stuff and
