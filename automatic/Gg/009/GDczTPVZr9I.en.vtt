00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.220
 hello my name is on the window front 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.750
 fourth inside.com i want you today 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.750
 a few critical thoughts on 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.670
 topic why varied training straight 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.920
 is so important for young horses and 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.570
 why many horses really early 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.570
 wear out the hand 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.750
 now, training certainly returned 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.450
 Art in itself and you should be there 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.850
 also get competent help or also 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.910
 really sound ones 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.970
 literature or online videos like it 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.650
 For example, horses inside.com are there 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.450
 really look at yourself and yourself 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.670
 theoretically with all the backgrounds 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.390
 employ 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.850
 in fact it is so statistical 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.950
 seen that the wear rate of 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.440
 horses are extremely high so we are in 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.839
 moment about seven years so 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.300
 from seven years on, that's the one 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:05.990
 most of the horses actually not 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.920
 more fully intact no longer before 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.980
 has more powerful already 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.720
 wear phenomena and 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:15.120
 Accordingly, a problem follow 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.120
 bill needs to be fully worked 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.200
 I imagine with seven years 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.350
 average wild horses age 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.120
 Expectation is almost 30 years 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.650
 really crazy the quarter of the 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.050
 life expectancy what such a picture leads 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.610
 but usually I want now 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.710
 just a few thoughts on this 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.990
 put a theme in the room or in the room 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.870
 meadow cleared why is that 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.450
 when we look at the old writings 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.850
 then it is so that a younger monte 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.980
 was up to six years and one 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.700
 so-called older mother was to eight 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.350
 years 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.350
 the monte means the home end effect 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.750
 nothing else than june drives or enters 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.750
 horse that just in the all right process 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.120
 that is a young training horse 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.800
 and if we look eight-year-old today 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.720
 yes, as I said many horses are already 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.640
 worn and no longer full 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.770
 resilient what a madness is really 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.750
 you should ask yourself how come 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.640
 In the end it really is like that 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.200
 a body and also a horse body 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.840
 just needs time to get to 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.330
 adapt to muscle tendon ligaments 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.480
 joints and bones 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.820
 to adapt to training stimuli so 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.610
 to adapt and I think so 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.930
 often forget plus one of my 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.780
 opinion after much too early 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.790
 specializing in horses when we are on 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.590
 The auction is here for example 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.480
 Warmblood auction then you know 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.380
 Three-year-old already that will be a springer 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.480
 That may be a dressage pony 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.400
 dressage talents this horse and then 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.430
 these horses would be with many tears 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.190
 entirely on one side towards this discipline 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.180
 working on states returns diverse 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.310
 form 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.240
 there is also currently I have 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.840
 straight in a big horse 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.709
 magazine read the study that 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.750
 varied trained horses 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.940
 not only motivated are what beliefs 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.459
 I'm relatively clear, but above all 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.590
 So much healthier, too 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.720
 means when I work floor today 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.610
 tomorrow dressage rider the day after tomorrow 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.340
 then maybe enough 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.530
 Free jumping Free jumping Day A farmer 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.330
 and then maybe no idea 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.730
 14 victories and then again 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.650
 dressage rider then this horse is 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.450
 not only really excited about it 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.830
 the work but is actually 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.000
 also much healthier 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:28.110
 through this complex 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.769
 complex construction of trainings 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.080
 irritate 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.000
 It's all extremely important and if you are 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.370
 the old script reads yes then stands 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.489
 in there young horse out into the terrain 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.130
 just work uphill downhill 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:43.680
 gallop sometimes on longer reins 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.800
 that the same balance that they find 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.230
 find your day that you let go 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.540
 with this artificial rider weight 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.890
 can even walk and what 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.230
 Unfortunately, you can actually see it today 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.790
 that the horses far too early too much 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.620
 be trained one-sided 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.030
 dressage dressage dressage is then 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.890
 sometime in between maybe still 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.750
 in the worst case bad lodges 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.730
 and then you wonder why the 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.290
 horses just 78 then really too 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.959
 problems get for example completely 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.269
 classic fetter wearer damage the feet 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:14.549
 shoulder lameness yard roll 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:18.140
 inflammation or what do I know what 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:21.840
 one-sided burden and not too 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:23.910
 skew the training correct what 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.389
 I want to give you a present when you come 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.979
 young horse please 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:29.110
 tried really diverse too 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:30.909
 work if you do it right 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.360
 Can you overload it 

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:37.389
 Of course, one could also prevent 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.860
 end effect floating motivation 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:42.219
 just always the same training 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.469
 prevent and can your horse piece for 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:47.620
 piece to the really powerful 

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:50.020
 and breed healthy horse then 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.699
 always remember eight-year-old is always 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.099
 actually still a remote that is 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:56.439
 A youth returns and one should search 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:58.300
 that also works and you should 

00:04:56.439 --> 00:05:00.569
 always think because then you have 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.860
 really in the horse what until the end of 20 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:05.770
 powerful is what is beautiful what 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:08.020
 can run elastically and what also 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.960
 not prone to any 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.120
 Damage to the movement apparatus and really 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.150
 also with enthusiasm until the end 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.430
 will work with you if you are 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.839
 more about horse training 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.490
 I want to inform it correctly then 

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:24.039
 are you on our platform horses 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:27.129
 inside.com that's exactly right 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:29.289
 lecturers like gerd heuschmann andrea eva 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:31.210
 like mars or my little ones 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:34.199
 you really horses just training 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.770
 teach and really great 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:38.620
 Show step-by-step instructions 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.389
 so it is right so it is wrong and 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:44.430
 why is it right or wrong
