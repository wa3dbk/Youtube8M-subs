00:00:04.482 --> 00:00:08.938
Hello, I’m Tammy from Turbo Tax with some 
 information for taxpayers serving in the military.

00:00:08.938 --> 00:00:12.828
As a member of the military, you can take any tax credit that’s available

00:00:12.828 --> 00:00:16.196
to non- military taxpayers—provided you qualify for it.

00:00:16.196 --> 00:00:19.523
However, if you are required to serve outside of the United States,

00:00:19.523 --> 00:00:21.911
the IRS provides some special rules

00:00:21.911 --> 00:00:24.621
that may just make you eligible for additional tax credits.

00:00:24.621 --> 00:00:27.600
Two of the biggest concessions the tax law makes

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.419
for deployed soldiers are an extension of the deadline

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:34.508
to qualify for the first-time homebuyer credit and the earned income credit.

00:00:34.508 --> 00:00:37.757
The first-time homebuyer credit reduces your tax bill

00:00:37.757 --> 00:00:41.317
on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the smaller of $8,000

00:00:41.317 --> 00:00:44.118
or 10 percent of the purchase price of your home.

00:00:44.118 --> 00:00:47.279
However, the home you purchase must be your principal residence

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:49.608
and not a vacation home or rental property.

00:00:49.608 --> 00:00:53.241
If you were deployed outside of the U.S. for at least 90 days

00:00:53.241 --> 00:00:57.494
between January 1, 2009 and April 30, 2010,

00:00:57.494 --> 00:01:00.267
the IRS gives you more time than other taxpayers

00:01:00.267 --> 00:01:03.184
to enter into a contract and complete the purchase of your home

00:01:03.184 --> 00:01:06.327
in order to qualify for the first-time homebuyer credit.

00:01:06.327 --> 00:01:09.678
This requires that you had entered into a contract to purchase your home

00:01:09.678 --> 00:01:12.080
on or before April 30, 2011

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.485
and closed no later than June 30, 2011.

00:01:15.485 --> 00:01:20.103
For other taxpayers, the first- time homebuyer credit isn’t available after 2010.

00:01:20.103 --> 00:01:23.401
Another beneficial credit is the earned income credit.

00:01:23.401 --> 00:01:26.831
This credit is refundable, meaning it can provide a tax refund

00:01:26.831 --> 00:01:30.338
even if you don't owe any taxes.Typically, taxpayers

00:01:30.338 --> 00:01:32.938
who report their dependent children must reside with them in the U.S.

00:01:32.938 --> 00:01:36.571
for more than half of the tax year. However, another exception exists

00:01:36.571 --> 00:01:39.323
for military personnel who are stationed outside of
the U.S.

00:01:39.323 --> 00:01:41.800
for an indefinite period or more than 90 days.

00:01:41.803 --> 00:01:44.300
For purposes of the earned income credit,

00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:48.570
the IRS treats the period that you and your 
 family are abroad as a temporary absence—

00:01:48.572 --> 00:01:52.250
meaning you are treated as residing in the U.S. the entire time.

00:01:52.252 --> 00:01:55.310
This exception also applies if you are outside of the U.S.

00:01:55.312 --> 00:01:58.750
while your family remains at home. In other words, you are considered

00:01:58.747 --> 00:02:01.810
to be living with your children in the U.S. despite being deployed abroad.

00:02:01.807 --> 00:02:04.970
Remember, when you file with TurboTax,

00:02:04.971 --> 00:02:09.380
we’ll ask you simple questions and determine which deductions and credits you qualify for.

00:02:09.377 --> 00:02:14.830
