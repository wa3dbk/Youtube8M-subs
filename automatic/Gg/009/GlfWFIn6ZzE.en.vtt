hello good to see you again
my<00:00:20.400> first<00:00:20.670> question<00:00:21.020> hybrid<00:00:22.020> means<00:00:22.170> there<00:00:22.620> are

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
my first question hybrid means there are

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.100 
my first question hybrid means there are
two<00:00:22.890> components<00:00:23.370> that<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.120> piano<00:00:24.720> consists

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.110 
two components that the piano consists

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.530 
two components that the piano consists
of<00:00:25.230> what<00:00:25.740> are<00:00:25.860> the<00:00:26.010> components<00:00:26.970> at<00:00:27.090> this<00:00:27.360> one

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:27.540 
of what are the components at this one

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.110 
of what are the components at this one
well<00:00:28.110> very<00:00:28.560> simple<00:00:28.950> the<00:00:29.160> two<00:00:29.310> components<00:00:29.940> are

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:30.120 
well very simple the two components are

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.780 
well very simple the two components are
one<00:00:30.770> components<00:00:31.770> from<00:00:31.950> the<00:00:32.099> acoustic<00:00:32.309> piano

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
one components from the acoustic piano

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.530 
one components from the acoustic piano
and<00:00:33.060> two<00:00:33.990> is<00:00:34.580> components<00:00:35.580> from<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.150> digital

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
and two is components from the digital

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.050 
and two is components from the digital
piano<00:00:36.810> and<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:38.070> component<00:00:38.670> from<00:00:38.820> the

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:39.060 
piano and the component from the

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.540 
piano and the component from the
acoustic<00:00:39.870> piano<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.500> course<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.980> as<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.490> can

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
acoustic piano of course is as you can

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.130 
acoustic piano of course is as you can
see<00:00:41.730> it's<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.960> action<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:44.329> the<00:00:45.329> keyboard<00:00:45.750> so

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
see it's the action and the keyboard so

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.680 
see it's the action and the keyboard so
this<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.560> the<00:00:46.980> real<00:00:47.250> action<00:00:47.970> of<00:00:48.150> an<00:00:48.420> upright

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
this is the real action of an upright

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.370 
this is the real action of an upright
piano<00:00:48.900> so<00:00:49.650> it<00:00:49.770> means<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.340> plays<00:00:50.910> exactly<00:00:51.690> like

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:52.380 
piano so it means it plays exactly like

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.770 
piano so it means it plays exactly like
real<00:00:53.160> acoustic<00:00:53.820> upright<00:00:54.150> piano<00:00:54.450> and<00:00:56.329> so<00:00:57.329> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
real acoustic upright piano and so the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.290 
real acoustic upright piano and so the
sound<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.470> from<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.310> digital<00:00:59.489> piano<00:00:59.790> so<00:01:00.149> there's

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
sound is from a digital piano so there's

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.450 
sound is from a digital piano so there's
a<00:01:00.390> tone<00:01:00.630> generator<00:01:00.710> producing<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.890> digital

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
a tone generator producing a digital

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.880 
a tone generator producing a digital
piano<00:01:02.579> sound<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.140> know<00:01:04.290> there<00:01:04.650> have<00:01:04.860> been

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
piano sound and I know there have been

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.430 
piano sound and I know there have been
hybrid<00:01:05.550> pianos<00:01:05.940> before<00:01:06.240> from<00:01:06.479> Yamaha<00:01:06.900> but

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
hybrid pianos before from Yamaha but

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.160 
hybrid pianos before from Yamaha but
what<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.190> so<00:01:08.580> special<00:01:08.880> about<00:01:08.940> this<00:01:09.210> one<00:01:09.390> so

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
what is the so special about this one so

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.870 
what is the so special about this one so
before<00:01:10.590> we<00:01:10.770> had<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:11.010> course<00:01:11.040> already<00:01:11.520> hybrid

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
before we had of course already hybrid

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.430 
before we had of course already hybrid
pianist<00:01:12.150> which<00:01:12.270> we<00:01:12.390> call<00:01:12.510> F<00:01:12.690> on<00:01:12.870> Trent<00:01:13.200> and
