and then tell them to think of a number
in<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:18.090> case<00:01:18.150> let's<00:01:18.810> say<00:01:18.900> you're<00:01:19.110> thinking

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
one and what would you get for so the

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.170 
one and what would you get for so the
fourth<00:01:26.880> car<00:01:27.150> will<00:01:27.420> be<00:01:27.540> your<00:01:27.689> card<00:01:27.930> one<00:01:28.229> two

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
fourth car will be your card one two

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.810 
fourth car will be your card one two
three<00:01:30.290> four<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:32.460> would<00:01:32.640> be<00:01:32.759> their<00:01:32.939> card

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
three four and that would be their card

three four and that would be their card
now<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.880> reveal<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:37.670> first<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.880> have<00:01:39.030> them

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
now to reveal it first you have them

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.230 
now to reveal it first you have them
pick<00:01:39.390> any<00:01:39.570> card<00:01:40.369> in<00:01:41.369> this<00:01:41.700> case<00:01:41.970> we're<00:01:42.210> going

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
pick any card in this case we're going

pick any card in this case we're going
to<00:01:42.390> use<00:01:43.640> for<00:01:44.640> space<00:01:46.310> then<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.460> put<00:01:47.670> it

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
to use for space then you put it

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.219 
to use for space then you put it
anywhere<00:01:48.119> in<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.570> middle<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.079> deck<00:01:51.229> then

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
anywhere in the middle of the deck then

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.120 
you take any amount of cards from the
front<00:01:54.810> just<00:01:55.340> to<00:01:56.340> cover<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.880> and

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
front just to cover it and

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.870 
front just to cover it and
and<00:01:58.450> well<00:01:59.450> you<00:01:59.479> have<00:01:59.810> it<00:01:59.930> facing<00:02:00.110> you<00:02:00.880> take

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
and well you have it facing you take

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.209 
and well you have it facing you take
count<00:02:02.450> off<00:02:02.659> the<00:02:03.020> card<00:02:03.259> you<00:02:03.500> take<00:02:03.740> some<00:02:03.920> exact

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219 
count off the card you take some exact

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:06.789 
count off the card you take some exact
let's<00:02:04.490> say<00:02:04.640> two<00:02:04.700> and<00:02:05.229> their<00:02:06.229> cards<00:02:06.500> right<00:02:06.649> here

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
let's say two and their cards right here

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.859 
let's say two and their cards right here
so<00:02:07.039> it<00:02:07.310> will<00:02:07.399> be<00:02:07.520> two<00:02:07.729> then<00:02:07.970> three<00:02:08.000> their<00:02:08.509> clubs

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
so it will be two then three their clubs

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.620 
so it will be two then three their clubs
will<00:02:08.989> be<00:02:09.019> the<00:02:09.200> third<00:02:09.410> card<00:02:09.709> when<00:02:09.890> you<00:02:10.039> say<00:02:10.630> you

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
will be the third card when you say you

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.400 
will be the third card when you say you
show<00:02:11.810> them<00:02:13.180> now<00:02:14.180> you<00:02:14.239> do<00:02:14.540> a<00:02:14.569> few<00:02:14.870> more<00:02:15.080> to<00:02:15.260> make

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
show them now you do a few more to make

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.530 
show them now you do a few more to make
it<00:02:15.530> look<00:02:15.650> less<00:02:15.860> obvious<00:02:16.750> and<00:02:17.750> then<00:02:17.989> you<00:02:18.140> just

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
it look less obvious and then you just

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.449 
it look less obvious and then you just
tap<00:02:20.540> this<00:02:20.810> and<00:02:21.080> slide<00:02:21.739> it<00:02:21.769> up<00:02:22.180> put<00:02:23.180> it<00:02:23.209> on<00:02:23.420> top

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
tap this and slide it up put it on top

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.920 
tap this and slide it up put it on top
and<00:02:25.459> do<00:02:25.910> a<00:02:25.940> false<00:02:26.300> shuffle<00:02:27.550> thing<00:02:28.550> like<00:02:28.940> this

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
and do a false shuffle thing like this

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.360 
and do a false shuffle thing like this
many<00:02:30.230> cars<00:02:30.500> on<00:02:30.769> top<00:02:32.739> and<00:02:33.739> then<00:02:33.920> you<00:02:34.069> would<00:02:34.190> just

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
many cars on top and then you would just

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.280 
many cars on top and then you would just
tell<00:02:34.580> them<00:02:34.849> think<00:02:35.120> of<00:02:35.239> a<00:02:35.299> number<00:02:35.450> who<00:02:36.140> did

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
tell them think of a number who did

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.130 
tell them think of a number who did
whatever<00:02:36.739> their<00:02:37.099> number<00:02:37.430> is<00:02:37.459> if<00:02:38.360> it's<00:02:38.900> higher

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
whatever their number is if it's higher

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.120 
whatever their number is if it's higher
or<00:02:39.590> lower<00:02:39.620> than<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.870> number<00:02:41.870> that<00:02:42.650> their<00:02:42.890> car

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
or lower than the number that their car

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.100 
or lower than the number that their car
will<00:02:43.340> be<00:02:43.519> let's<00:02:43.940> since<00:02:44.630> it's<00:02:44.840> going<00:02:44.989> to<00:02:45.049> be

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
will be let's since it's going to be

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.530 
will be let's since it's going to be
three<00:02:45.319> cards<00:02:45.680> away<00:02:45.970> let's<00:02:46.970> say<00:02:47.090> they<00:02:47.239> think<00:02:47.450> of

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
three cards away let's say they think of

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.920 
three cards away let's say they think of
a<00:02:47.599> five<00:02:47.840> it's<00:02:48.170> on<00:02:48.319> the<00:02:48.500> subtract<00:02:48.980> two<00:02:49.160> and<00:02:49.930> what

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
a five it's on the subtract two and what

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.600 
a five it's on the subtract two and what
do<00:02:51.019> they<00:02:51.079> get<00:02:51.349> then<00:02:51.709> you<00:02:51.829> turn<00:02:52.069> three<00:02:52.370> the

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
do they get then you turn three the

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.880 
do they get then you turn three the
third<00:02:52.790> card<00:02:53.090> will<00:02:53.269> be<00:02:53.299> their<00:02:53.569> card<00:02:53.840> can<00:02:54.650> do<00:02:54.769> the

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
third card will be their card can do the

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.410 
third card will be their card can do the
same<00:02:55.040> we're<00:02:55.220> adding<00:02:55.519> if<00:02:55.640> they<00:02:55.790> think<00:02:56.000> of<00:02:56.120> one

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
same we're adding if they think of one

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.309 
same we're adding if they think of one
tell<00:02:57.230> them<00:02:57.319> to<00:02:57.349> add<00:02:57.440> two<00:02:57.829> and<00:02:58.180> then<00:02:59.180> say<00:02:59.959> that

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
tell them to add two and then say that

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.319 
tell them to add two and then say that
third<00:03:00.470> car<00:03:00.739> will<00:03:00.920> be<00:03:01.040> the<00:03:01.160> car<00:03:01.400> so<00:03:02.060> then<00:03:02.239> it

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
third car will be the car so then it

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:08.289 
third car will be the car so then it
will<00:03:02.450> be<00:03:02.540> 1<00:03:02.780> 2<00:03:03.319> 3<00:03:03.620> in<00:03:04.310> their<00:03:04.519> cars<00:03:05.180> and<00:03:07.299> that

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
will be 1 2 3 in their cars and that

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:11.140 
will be 1 2 3 in their cars and that
ends<00:03:08.630> my<00:03:08.810> trip
