00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 
about the first time we made a small

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720 
cue but with some switches that let you

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.969 
cue but with some switches that let you
balance<00:01:04.720> the<00:01:04.930> equalization<00:01:05.289> between<00:01:05.560> the<00:01:05.860> two

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
balance the equalization between the two

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.790 
balance the equalization between the two
channels<00:01:06.160> and<00:01:06.880> it<00:01:07.810> has<00:01:08.050> a<00:01:08.080> range<00:01:08.380> of<00:01:08.560> sounds

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
channels and it has a range of sounds

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.969 
channels and it has a range of sounds
that<00:01:09.100> goes<00:01:09.429> from<00:01:10.110> very<00:01:11.110> nice<00:01:11.619> cleans

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
that goes from very nice cleans

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:13.889 
that goes from very nice cleans
considering<00:01:12.759> it's<00:01:12.940> based<00:01:13.209> on<00:01:13.330> a<00:01:13.420> Marcel<00:01:13.750> sit

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899 
considering it's based on a Marcel sit

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:17.430 
considering it's based on a Marcel sit
with<00:01:14.080> very<00:01:14.380> nice<00:01:14.560> cleans<00:01:14.860> up<00:01:15.729> to<00:01:16.259> very<00:01:17.259> good

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
with very nice cleans up to very good

high gain for her rock and and more

high gain for her rock and and more
modern<00:01:20.950> metal<00:01:21.399> so<00:01:22.050> this<00:01:23.050> is<00:01:23.200> this<00:01:23.440> is<00:01:23.619> probably

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
modern metal so this is this is probably

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:29.730 
modern metal so this is this is probably
or<00:01:24.509> most<00:01:25.509> complete<00:01:26.170> and<00:01:27.000> right<00:01:28.000> now<00:01:28.709> we<00:01:29.709> are

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
or most complete and right now we are

00:01:29.740 --> 00:02:01.160 
or most complete and right now we are
very<00:01:30.009> proud<00:01:30.220> of<00:01:30.280> about<00:01:30.700> it

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.390 

this<00:02:02.170> is<00:02:02.320> a<00:02:02.530> million<00:02:02.890> this<00:02:03.100> is<00:02:03.340> a

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
this is a million this is a

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.370 
this is a million this is a
three-channel<00:02:03.940> um<00:02:04.180> it<00:02:04.390> has<00:02:04.990> an<00:02:05.140> independent

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
three-channel um it has an independent

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.639 
three-channel um it has an independent
clean<00:02:05.830> channel<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:07.390> has<00:02:07.600> all<00:02:07.810> the<00:02:08.229> controls

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
clean channel that has all the controls

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.240 
clean channel that has all the controls
even<00:02:08.890> an<00:02:09.420> independent<00:02:10.420> volume<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.920> then<00:02:12.130> it

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
even an independent volume and then it

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.530 
even an independent volume and then it
has<00:02:12.460> the<00:02:12.610> drive<00:02:12.820> channel<00:02:13.180> has<00:02:13.330> two

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
has the drive channel has two

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.470 
has the drive channel has two
independent<00:02:14.080> channels<00:02:14.310> that<00:02:15.310> a<00:02:15.640> one<00:02:16.150> of<00:02:16.330> them

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
independent channels that a one of them

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.160 
independent channels that a one of them
is<00:02:16.780> a<00:02:17.080> mortise<00:02:17.920> like<00:02:18.100> a<00:02:18.130> hot<00:02:18.820> rod<00:02:19.060> a<00:02:19.090> DCM<00:02:19.570> 800

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
is a mortise like a hot rod a DCM 800

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.380 
is a mortise like a hot rod a DCM 800
and<00:02:20.350> the<00:02:20.440> other<00:02:20.560> one<00:02:20.830> goes<00:02:21.130> way<00:02:21.580> higher<00:02:21.610> on<00:02:22.270> the

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
and the other one goes way higher on the

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.260 
and the other one goes way higher on the
gain<00:02:22.540> Department<00:02:23.040> so<00:02:24.040> you<00:02:24.130> can<00:02:24.400> have<00:02:24.580> a<00:02:24.790> three

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
gain Department so you can have a three

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.690 
gain Department so you can have a three
channel<00:02:25.540> say<00:02:26.080> to<00:02:26.740> cover<00:02:27.010> all<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.340> range<00:02:27.550> of

sounds to master volumes in all the
range<00:02:30.700> of<00:02:30.910> fans<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.420> effects<00:02:31.960> loop<00:02:32.080> is<00:02:32.370> serial

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
range of fans the effects loop is serial

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.370

people<00:03:48.330> that<00:03:48.360> like<00:03:48.720> hardrock<00:03:49.230> tones<00:03:49.970> 80s<00:03:50.970> and

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
people that like hardrock tones 80s and

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.350 
people that like hardrock tones 80s and
90s<00:03:51.660> modern<00:03:52.050> metal<00:03:52.550> this<00:03:53.550> this<00:03:53.850> is<00:03:53.970> a<00:03:54.090> very

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
90s modern metal this this is a very

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.880 
90s modern metal this this is a very
high<00:03:54.540> gain<00:03:54.720> um<00:03:55.020> but<00:03:55.260> with<00:03:55.470> a<00:03:55.500> lot<00:03:55.740> of

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
high gain um but with a lot of

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.920 
high gain um but with a lot of
definition<00:03:56.460> that<00:03:56.490> respects<00:03:57.120> also<00:03:57.390> the<00:03:57.540> tone

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
definition that respects also the tone

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.110 
definition that respects also the tone
of<00:03:57.960> the<00:03:58.290> of<00:03:58.650> the<00:03:59.130> guitar<00:03:59.460> and<00:03:59.700> the<00:03:59.820> players

respect say the sound of your guitar and

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.700 
respect say the sound of your guitar and
the<00:04:08.520> way<00:04:08.670> you<00:04:08.730> play<00:04:09.110> so<00:04:10.110> you<00:04:10.140> have<00:04:10.440> a<00:04:10.470> lot<00:04:10.680> of

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:10.710 
the way you play so you have a lot of

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.890 
the way you play so you have a lot of
different<00:04:11.220> sounds<00:04:11.430> only<00:04:11.850> barring<00:04:12.330> the<00:04:12.600> you're

different sounds only barring the you're

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.560 
different sounds only barring the you're
playing<00:04:13.140> and<00:04:14.100> I<00:04:14.250> see<00:04:14.430> some<00:04:14.640> combo<00:04:15.030> amps<00:04:15.330> over

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
playing and I see some combo amps over

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.860 
playing and I see some combo amps over
here<00:04:15.810> yes<00:04:16.260> there's<00:04:16.890> to<00:04:17.070> your<00:04:17.190> Plex<00:04:17.690> we<00:04:18.690> have

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
done it also in one virtual combo it's

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.760 
done it also in one virtual combo it's
also<00:04:21.810> 50<00:04:22.230> watts<00:04:23.600> has<00:04:24.600> the<00:04:24.750> same<00:04:24.930> features<00:04:25.320> two

also<00:04:31.230> have<00:04:31.410> say<00:04:31.650> some<00:04:31.980> resonance<00:04:32.520> deep<00:04:32.760> a

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
also have say some resonance deep a

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
control on the feedback loop you can

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.960 
control on the feedback loop you can
also<00:04:36.300> change<00:04:36.720> the<00:04:36.990> feedback<00:04:37.500> line<00:04:38.250> to<00:04:38.580> to<00:04:38.820> get

also change the feedback line to to get

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.690 
also change the feedback line to to get
more<00:04:39.150> fuller<00:04:39.870> sound<00:04:40.200> more<00:04:40.590> open<00:04:40.919> or<00:04:41.130> more

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
more fuller sound more open or more

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.840 
more fuller sound more open or more
compressed<00:04:42.150> so<00:04:42.810> it's<00:04:43.710> complicated<00:04:44.250> not<00:04:44.700> to

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
compressed so it's complicated not to

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.040 
compressed so it's complicated not to
find<00:04:45.120> a<00:04:45.419> sound<00:04:46.020> you<00:04:46.230> like<00:04:46.260> from<00:04:47.040> from<00:04:47.370> the<00:04:47.550> SAMS

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
find a sound you like from from the SAMS

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.620 
find a sound you like from from the SAMS
can<00:04:49.050> you<00:04:49.140> say<00:04:49.410> a<00:04:49.440> little<00:04:49.710> bit<00:04:49.860> about<00:04:50.490> some<00:04:51.480> of

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
can you say a little bit about some of

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.960 
can you say a little bit about some of
the<00:04:51.780> ways<00:04:51.990> that<00:04:52.560> your<00:04:52.770> designs<00:04:53.190> are<00:04:53.669> different

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
the ways that your designs are different

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.250 
the ways that your designs are different
from

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
from

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.460 
from
vintage<00:04:57.260> amps<00:04:57.620> that<00:04:57.770> they're<00:04:57.980> inspired<00:04:58.490> by

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
vintage amps that they're inspired by

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.470 
vintage amps that they're inspired by
and<00:05:00.470> we<00:05:01.340> love<00:05:01.520> vintage<00:05:01.760> amps

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
and we love vintage amps

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.260 
and we love vintage amps
and<00:05:03.260> we<00:05:03.470> really<00:05:03.830> like<00:05:04.310> how<00:05:04.550> how<00:05:04.820> they<00:05:05.000> sound

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
and we really like how how they sound

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.290 
and we really like how how they sound
but<00:05:06.080> we<00:05:06.350> always<00:05:06.530> say<00:05:06.919> think<00:05:07.430> that<00:05:07.610> we<00:05:08.120> can

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
but we always say think that we can

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
but we always say think that we can
evolve<00:05:08.600> this<00:05:09.520> this<00:05:10.520> concept<00:05:10.780> into<00:05:11.780> something

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
evolve this this concept into something

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.090 
evolve this this concept into something
that<00:05:12.350> can<00:05:12.710> be<00:05:13.000> usable<00:05:14.000> but<00:05:14.600> at<00:05:15.500> a<00:05:15.800> sauna

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
that can be usable but at a sauna

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.580 
that can be usable but at a sauna
scenario<00:05:16.639> for<00:05:16.820> example<00:05:16.850> playing<00:05:17.479> live<00:05:17.750> or<00:05:18.410> in

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
scenario for example playing live or in

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.710 
scenario for example playing live or in
a<00:05:18.680> studio<00:05:18.919> where<00:05:19.250> where<00:05:20.030> you<00:05:20.150> can<00:05:20.330> only<00:05:20.479> take

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
a studio where where you can only take

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.750 
a studio where where you can only take
for<00:05:20.900> example<00:05:20.930> wanna<00:05:21.740> if<00:05:22.280> you<00:05:22.340> don't<00:05:22.610> have<00:05:22.729> a

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
for example wanna if you don't have a

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.490 
for example wanna if you don't have a
lot<00:05:22.910> of<00:05:22.940> amps<00:05:23.330> so<00:05:24.139> what<00:05:24.650> we<00:05:24.800> have<00:05:25.010> done<00:05:25.310> is<00:05:25.610> to

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
lot of amps so what we have done is to

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.010 
lot of amps so what we have done is to
evolve<00:05:27.500> the<00:05:27.770> circuit<00:05:28.190> up<00:05:28.729> to<00:05:29.030> to<00:05:29.780> our<00:05:29.870> own

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
evolve the circuit up to to our own

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.800 
evolve the circuit up to to our own
circuit<00:05:30.470> that<00:05:30.650> lets<00:05:31.220> you<00:05:31.430> get<00:05:32.150> a<00:05:32.389> lot<00:05:32.630> of

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
circuit that lets you get a lot of

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.080 
circuit that lets you get a lot of
different<00:05:33.440> sounds<00:05:33.650> of<00:05:34.010> the<00:05:34.250> out<00:05:34.520> of<00:05:34.580> the<00:05:34.790> same

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
different sounds of the out of the same

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.750 
different sounds of the out of the same
concept<00:05:35.540> and<00:05:35.979> the<00:05:36.979> range<00:05:37.220> of<00:05:37.340> sounds<00:05:37.729> that

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.760 
concept and the range of sounds that

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.020 
concept and the range of sounds that
they<00:05:38.030> get<00:05:38.240> and<00:05:38.560> it's<00:05:39.560> pretty<00:05:40.250> wide<00:05:40.550> compared

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.030 
they get and it's pretty wide compared

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.600 
they get and it's pretty wide compared
to<00:05:41.150> the<00:05:41.300> vintage<00:05:41.840> amps<00:05:42.350> where<00:05:42.560> they<00:05:42.800> are<00:05:43.010> more

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
to the vintage amps where they are more

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.230 
to the vintage amps where they are more
or<00:05:43.729> less<00:05:43.790> based<00:05:44.150> so<00:05:44.960> you<00:05:44.990> have<00:05:45.290> a<00:05:45.320> lot<00:05:45.530> of<00:05:45.560> a

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
or less based so you have a lot of a

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.909 
or less based so you have a lot of a
different<00:05:47.240> sounds<00:05:47.660> depending<00:05:48.139> on<00:05:48.560> the<00:05:48.740> gain

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 
different sounds depending on the gain

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:50.980 
different sounds depending on the gain
you<00:05:49.160> can<00:05:49.310> put<00:05:49.520> again<00:05:49.789> way<00:05:50.000> low<00:05:50.210> and<00:05:50.450> the

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
you can put again way low and the

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.469 
you can put again way low and the
understand<00:05:51.470> sound<00:05:52.220> duel<00:05:52.490> doesn't<00:05:52.850> sound<00:05:53.270> out

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:53.479 
understand sound duel doesn't sound out

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:56.830 
understand sound duel doesn't sound out
it<00:05:54.080> keeps<00:05:54.440> sounding<00:05:54.770> nice<00:05:55.460> and<00:05:56.000> you<00:05:56.330> can<00:05:56.510> add
