00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.650
 they work in this septic tank of 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.080
 wastewater storage 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.760
 domestic workers are part of a group of 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.800
 University of Seville investigating 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.020
 water engineering systems but 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.270
 designed for anywhere in the world 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.880
 the construction technique are wheels 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.380
 compacted with earth in a material 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.119
 that can be found in very many 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.699
 sites and this we have done so because 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.160
 we work in countries where 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.550
 economic means and resources do not 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.560
 reach to have a treatment of 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.809
 Waste water worthy and in addition 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.460
 self-built cars have been in use for more than 25 years 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.039
 developing a training program 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.440
 in water for hundreds of technicians over 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:48.420
 from 30 countries with their hands have designed 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.070
 for example this sanitation channel 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.550
 for those who can not afford 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.019
 pipes something as simple as it uses the 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.420
 water at home and say goodbye to her 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:59.730
 giving him a button to turn on a tap that 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.590
 it is completely in state then at 40 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.480
 percent of the world's population does not 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.060
 there are pipe treatment systems 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.560
 of water therefore we have the 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.750
 disease at the door of home are 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.400
 knowledge that the Romans already used 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.800
 Grace is stairs that is capable of 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.470
 put oxygen without 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.920
 need no compressor then 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.750
 places with big slopes wherever 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.930
 difficult to access a power source 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.750
 It is an appropriate technology for 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.370
 those places everything starts here in the 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.830
 university school laboratories 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.690
 seville polytechnic where it is analyzed 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.640
 the amount of oxygen needed by the 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.460
 wastewater for its treatment more 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.560
 optimal we pilot experiences that do not 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.730
 work well in the laboratory the 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.340
 we carry 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.720
 the experimental fields and those that 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.630
 experimental fields give us good 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.850
 results we are developing them in 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.670
 different Latin American countries and 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.040
 now also here in Spain where no 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.540
 there is so much economic need but if 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.910
 there is a need for efficiency 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.740
 energetic away from working to create 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.540
 a patent these researchers what 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.640
 do for the millions of children around 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.560
 the world that get sick and die for the 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.560
 contact with these wastewater
