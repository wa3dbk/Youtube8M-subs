00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:13.349
 sometimes every day another necklace 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:17.910
 kiss because the theme is envy people was a 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:21.090
 theme that was is and passed by anad 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.060
 Nati, a tatiane kiss there in Fortaleza. 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.310
 my friend and I came to talk about this theme 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.699
 For you, because I came to talk about this subject. 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.900
 people nowadays everything you put 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.460
 and envy 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.620
 Have you noticed that you can talk more? 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.890
 Nothing that you are jealous 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.010
 if there is envy in much too much 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.649
 but we have to see to what extent 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:49.760
 really that person is seeing you 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:53.910
 Looks really will be people envy 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56.160
 yes it would be for us to be happy to see 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.559
 people envy us not 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.280
 The problem is that there are two types of 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.230
 envy 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.449
 There is that white envy that people 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.600
 says that it is envy that really 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:10.200
 people admire the people that is where 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.689
 She was jealous but she did not. 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.299
 I wish you badly if it's too much in her she thinks 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.189
 so wow, what a beautiful woman who 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.659
 beautiful makeup there how would I have 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.320
 a hair like that but it 's nothing 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:26.670
 psychopathic, right? 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.110
 good, let's talk seriously now about 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.079
 envy 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.570
 according to the psychologist alexandre bess a 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:38.369
 envy he is the worst feeling that being 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:41.070
 he may have during his lifetime. 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.200
 the envious, he wants to take the place of the 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.380
 I envy that this is the problem. 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.780
 for me there are several types of envy 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.630
 when we are then exposed in a network 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.829
 social as facebook like youtube 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.960
 Oh, the things she turns into a good fuca 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.170
 There's nobody that he does until done channel 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.820
 only to go there and criticize him, yes he goes there 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.180
 I need to bring down to humiliate 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.829
 They talk about your hair on your fingernail. 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.899
 color of your lipstick 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.209
 Then your rhythm is not good 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.680
 the trip are talking until the 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.950
 you have behind the ear 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.700
 yes unfortunately today thing 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.590
 arrived at this point I in the previous video 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.860
 I said that sometimes we talk 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:30.220
 people who are whining about the 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.920
 does not only have several types of 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.079
 people are also moaning people are by 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.540
 example on my facebook I hate to see 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:40.480
 that the death outcome of those things 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.329
 that staff puts know videos from 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.790
 people killing people from that 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:47.920
 I really do not like 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.920
 now also if you put something 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.930
 Good darling, as I already told you. 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.840
 nobody short because nobody wants to see you 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.400
 Happy, I do not want to see you happy if the 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.709
 people who really like you 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.659
 now the envious man he does not want to see you 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:05.200
 happy if he was always worse than 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:08.200
 that it is then a problem of Jose to 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.120
 envy life like no one's all 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.280
 your steps 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.739
 yes but the good news that envy has 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.569
 treatment I knew if the treatment he 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.919
 it's psychological there's no medicine 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.400
 for envy 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:23.590
 the envious man acts by compulsion 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.260
 compulsion to live in function of the other 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:30.040
 live he will live chasing that 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.560
 person and this is treated as compulsion 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.199
 then it is treated compulsion 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.599
 I think there is a big difference 

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:40.299
 between admiration and envy what I ended up 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:43.299
 to speak at the beginning of the video admiration 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:45.639
 it would be the same as using the we 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:49.569
 white envy you can admire a 

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:53.290
 person pick it up as a model, that's it 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:56.769
 white envy does not exist rage evil 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:59.739
 unlike the envious as people 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:01.299
 Does to recognize the envious good it 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.069
 will stick on your foot 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:05.229
 people he will stick his foot the same 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.659
 those critters will even stand him 

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:10.329
 count and half and will chase it goes 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:13.629
 be on all your social networks 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:16.150
 the envious one and has mania of comparison him 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:18.220
 will keep an eye on everything you do and 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.959
 try to do something wrong 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.560
 because it will be the first one is 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.270
 it does not even need to do 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.090
 wrong will he criticize you even if 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.490
 You do not do anything good. 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.740
 the concealment of falsehood and evil 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.919
 they are characteristic of a person 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.200
 envious she will lie to increase 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:38.370
 she will invent things that do not 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:43.919
 happened 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:46.130
 well let's not forget that the 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:49.320
 envious he is always an expert 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:52.380
 gossiper yes he will create his seals 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.970
 but all of them are intentions to the demanding 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.280
 do not forget the envious and will 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.889
 channel the energies of and only one 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.990
 victim at a time rather because the envious not 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:04.260
 can channel his energy into 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:07.020
 two or three victims at a time and will 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.840
 catch you for Christ and even get tired of 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.220
 you you'll have to deal with this 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.389
 situation 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:17.190
 good people are there is envy and there is me 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:19.020
 I think today you are envious of some 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:23.550
 people already wanted to have what the 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:25.710
 person has know but suddenly it's got 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:29.610
 people who take it for a feeling 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:32.130
 bad for a pro channel check this on 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.800
 her life and here we call sometimes 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:37.200
 a person touches her 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.470
 she lies on top of you because big 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.479
 celebrity tested cars because these 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.440
 people wanted to have the life that 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:45.870
 person has 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.740
 I have already noticed that on larger 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.910
 youtube 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:53.639
 both men and women are 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:55.440
 That's the way it goes. People have a lot of 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:58.260
 people who unfortunately are not just 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.450
 There are a lot of people with the 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.310
 feeling of envy then you can 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.870
 to notice if a person is traveling 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.210
 cool if a person buys clothes 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.430
 cool if a person says they hit 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:11.250
 the number of legal servers will have 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.710
