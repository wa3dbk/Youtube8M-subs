00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:07.970
 we started point 3 the discovery 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.719
 of the cell the cell theory 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:14.000
 the cells are small and complex 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:16.369
 they are very difficult to observe so much 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.100
 its structure and therefore describe 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:21.439
 its molecular composition but still 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.770
 it is more difficult to elucidate how 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:27.640
 its components work 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:31.420
 a typical animal cell measures between 19 and 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.370
 20 micrometers that is about five times 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.670
 the smallest particle visible through the eye 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.100
 human 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.500
 for that reason until it was not available 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.620
 good optical microscopes at the beginning 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.050
 from the 19th century it was not discovered that all 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.020
 the plant and animal tissues were 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.300
 aggregates of cells 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.360
 this discovery postulated by slade 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.700
 and unusual in 1838 as the cellular theory 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.130
 marks the birth of biology 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.080
 mobile 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.390
 however there was a long way to go 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.460
 go through in the application of 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.970
 new study techniques until you get 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.140
 to modern cell theory 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:11.390
 in 1600 hypersis hans jansen father e 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.480
 son is attributed the intervention of the 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.240
 compound microscope that is to say place 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.490
 two magnifying glasses one on each side of 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.670
 a tube refining this 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.440
 organization and its components 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.280
 would allow to observe later the 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:30.960
 cells 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.180
 in 1664 Robert Hooke physical and 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.270
 technologists biologist and engineer the 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.890
 architect published a book entitled 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.500
 micrographs where he described for the first 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.530
 time the evidence of the existence of 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.290
 cells 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.690
 I study the cork and saw a provision 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:50.110
 in the form of honeycomb to each 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:53.590
 simple or cellular shredded camarita but 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.330
 he was not aware that that was 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.820
 a structure similar to what 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.500
 we know today as cells in 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.880
 actually believed that those spaces in 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.140
 places where people would move 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.390
 Plant nutrients 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.800
 although I do not intuit that those cells 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.410
 they were the functional unit of beings 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.420
 alive the denomination of cells has 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.700
 remained to name the vicarage 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.740
 inside those cliques and then they 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.050
 applied also for discoveries in 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.200
 animals 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.350
 antÃ³n van leeuwenhoek a merchant 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.240
 fabrics built at the same time 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.730
 single microscopes with a single lens 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.860
 but with a perfection never known 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.260
 until then thanks to this 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.260
 microscope the most powerful of the time 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.300
 that allowed to reach 270 increases 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.640
 made descriptions of crowd of 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.030
 biological materials with some details 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.830
 until then unimaginable can be 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.670
 considered as the father of the 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:51.140
 microbiology observed drops of water 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.200
 sperm blood 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.880
 red blood cells comes to think that all 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.310
 the animals were formed by 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.480
 globules but I can not associate 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.489
 with the cells of the plants 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.950
 it is not until the beginning of the 19th century 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.560
 when the gestation of the 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.950
 cellular theory in france with edward and 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.989
 russell they observed a lot 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.150
 of different animal tissues and 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.459
 published that the tissues were 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.430
 formed by globular units but 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:24.760
 with uneven distribution rappel was 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:27.010
 chemical and proposed that every cell was 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.110
 as a laboratory thanks to which 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.530
 Organize tissues and organisms 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:35.290
 but they believed that every cell by way of 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.019
 Russian doll came from new vesicles 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.660
 that were becoming independent and even 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:42.390
 proposed that they would have sex the majority 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.300
 they were more florists 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:48.540
 he said the famous phrase with a cell to 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.810
 that is to say every cell comes from 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.709
 another cell 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.510
 and another one is also French wrote yes 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.330
 one compares the extreme simplicity of 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.280
 this structure the cell with the extreme 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.349
 diversity of its content 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.170
 it is clear that it constitutes a unit 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:08.019
 basic of an organized state in 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.050
 everything is finally derived from 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:13.380
 the cell 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:15.570
 in 1831 roberval discovers the 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.299
 nucleus in eukaryotic cells what 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.070
 anticipated the cell theory in addition 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.410
 He published his observations on the 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.780
 phenomenon that would be called movement 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.700
 browniano is to say the movement 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.790
 messy of the particles in 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.790
 suspension 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:37.670
 it is in 1838 when it is law of visual 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:40.820
 formalize the cell theory 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:44.580
 the modern cellular theory is summarized in 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:48.509
 four fundamental postulates 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:51.620
 the first is that the cell is the unit 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:53.770
 anatomical of all living beings 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:57.949
 all living beings without exception 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:05:00.710
 vegetable animals fungi propistas 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:03.580
 They are made up of cells and their 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.580
 cell products 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.410
 the second is that only new ones are formed 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.420
 cells by cell division 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:13.120
 pre-existing 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:15.130
 in the same way we can say that 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.070
 every organism originates from 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:20.680
 another president does not exist therefore the 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.720
 spontaneous generation even in the 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.840
 simplest microbes 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:28.930
 the third is that life only exists in 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:31.510
 the cells the vital functions have 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:35.050
 relationship with the activity of the cell 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:37.960
 all cells work according 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:40.020
 with a unitary plan the processes 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:43.740
 vital are extraordinarily 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:45.900
 similar with all living beings 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.360
 the functions of beings 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.190
 multicellular are the result of the 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.460
 sum of the functions of each of its 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.460
 cells 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:59.169
 each cell contains all turn 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:01.930
 information necessary for the control of 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:04.949
 its own cycle and the development of a 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.949
 organism of its kind 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.810
 there are similarities in the components 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.030
 chemicals in the metabolic activity of 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.590
 all the cells the molecules that 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.900
 they form the membrane of all the cells 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.500
 lipids are carbohydrate proteins 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.900
 regardless of the class of 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.520
 agency concerned in all 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.740
 organisms the genetic material is 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.370
 constituted by nucleic acid the 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:27.560
 the cells can 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.960
 we can not understand also how the 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:32.000
 unit not only structural and 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.600
 functional but also a unit 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.600
 genetics
