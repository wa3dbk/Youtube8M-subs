and options are I won't tell you how to

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.219 
and options are I won't tell you how to
use<00:01:35.640> them<00:01:35.880> just<00:01:36.030> yet<00:01:36.270> because<00:01:36.630> that's<00:01:36.810> all

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
use them just yet because that's all

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.310 
use them just yet because that's all
covered<00:01:37.560> in<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:38.850> help<00:01:39.119> files<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.840> in<00:01:40.140> other

lessons this is just to give you an idea

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.510 
lessons this is just to give you an idea
of<00:01:42.360> where<00:01:42.540> all<00:01:42.630> these<00:01:42.750> things<00:01:42.810> are<00:01:43.110> located<00:01:43.520> so

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
of where all these things are located so

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.069 
of where all these things are located so
once<00:01:44.700> we've<00:01:44.850> got<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.030> correct<00:01:45.299> we<00:01:45.450> click<00:01:45.659> OK

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
once we've got that correct we click OK

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.740 
once we've got that correct we click OK
and<00:01:46.520> once<00:01:47.520> we<00:01:47.670> have<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:47.939> with<00:01:48.060> our<00:01:48.210> job<00:01:48.479> and

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
and once we have you with our job and

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.569 
and once we have you with our job and
its<00:01:48.899> position<00:01:49.320> we<00:01:49.439> can<00:01:49.590> click<00:01:49.740> rip<00:01:49.979> only<00:01:50.340> and

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
its position we can click rip only and

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.460 
its position we can click rip only and
that<00:01:50.790> will<00:01:50.939> rip<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.390> send<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.170> look<00:01:52.350> at

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
that will rip it and send it to look at

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.780 
that will rip it and send it to look at
it<00:01:52.530> directly<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.159> job<00:01:53.369> queue

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
it directly to the job queue

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.280 
it directly to the job queue
I've<00:01:53.880> pre-ripped<00:01:54.390> this<00:01:54.540> job<00:01:54.810> just<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.049> show

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
I've pre-ripped this job just to show

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.260 
I've pre-ripped this job just to show
you<00:01:55.350> what<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.250> looks<00:01:56.399> like<00:01:56.520> once<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:56.939> has<00:01:57.090> been

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
you what it looks like once it has been

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.139 
you what it looks like once it has been
ripped<00:01:57.740> and<00:01:58.740> then<00:01:59.250> we<00:01:59.340> can<00:01:59.549> load<00:01:59.700> some<00:01:59.880> media

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
ripped and then we can load some media

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.069 
ripped and then we can load some media
into<00:02:00.390> our<00:02:00.509> printer

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
into our printer

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.830 
into our printer

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
turn it on click print now and that will

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.179 
turn it on click print now and that will
immediately<00:02:04.049> start<00:02:04.530> printing<00:02:04.860> on<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.040> our

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
immediately start printing on to our

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.389 
immediately start printing on to our
printer<00:02:05.750> we<00:02:06.750> can<00:02:06.899> also<00:02:07.020> decide<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.860> keep<00:02:08.190> our

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
printer we can also decide to keep our

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.550 
printer we can also decide to keep our
jobs<00:02:08.450> retain<00:02:09.450> them<00:02:09.629> by<00:02:09.750> having<00:02:10.050> this<00:02:10.140> checkbox

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
jobs retain them by having this checkbox

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.940 
jobs retain them by having this checkbox
on<00:02:10.830> or<00:02:11.580> turn<00:02:11.879> that<00:02:12.000> off

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
on or turn that off

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.680 
on or turn that off
we<00:02:13.040> don't<00:02:13.220> give<00:02:13.489> our<00:02:13.610> jobs<00:02:13.849> we<00:02:14.180> can<00:02:14.270> delete<00:02:14.510> our

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
we don't give our jobs we can delete our

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.440 
we don't give our jobs we can delete our
job<00:02:14.870> out<00:02:15.050> like<00:02:15.260> that<00:02:15.530> and<00:02:16.120> delete<00:02:17.120> them<00:02:17.300> and

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
job out like that and delete them and

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.630 
job out like that and delete them and
we're<00:02:17.840> finished<00:02:18.260> with<00:02:18.410> them<00:02:18.590> so<00:02:19.340> that's<00:02:19.489> how

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
we're finished with them so that's how

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.790 
we're finished with them so that's how
we<00:02:19.700> generally<00:02:20.390> send<00:02:20.750> artwork<00:02:21.260> to<00:02:21.440> our<00:02:21.560> large

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
we generally send artwork to our large

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.680 
we generally send artwork to our large
format<00:02:22.160> printer<00:02:22.519> using<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.060> artwork<00:02:23.300> manager

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
format printer using the artwork manager

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.740 
format printer using the artwork manager
and<00:02:23.780> rip<00:02:23.900> manager<00:02:24.760> so<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:25.879> next<00:02:26.060> stage<00:02:26.330> is<00:02:26.360> to

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
and rip manager so the next stage is to

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.800 
and rip manager so the next stage is to
look<00:02:27.019> at<00:02:27.260> tile<00:02:28.160> overlapping<00:02:28.670> so<00:02:29.330> we'll<00:02:29.630> bring

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
look at tile overlapping so we'll bring

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.259 
look at tile overlapping so we'll bring
this<00:02:29.930> job<00:02:30.170> in<00:02:30.349> now<00:02:31.099> for<00:02:31.250> example<00:02:31.340> we<00:02:32.030> might

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
this job in now for example we might

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.380 
this job in now for example we might
only<00:02:32.390> have<00:02:32.630> say<00:02:32.810> 48<00:02:33.170> inch<00:02:33.380> media<00:02:33.830> on<00:02:33.980> our

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
only have say 48 inch media on our

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.259 
only have say 48 inch media on our
printer<00:02:35.390> so<00:02:35.780> we<00:02:35.959> can't<00:02:36.200> actually<00:02:37.060> print<00:02:38.060> this

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
printer so we can't actually print this

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.050 
printer so we can't actually print this
at<00:02:38.510> its<00:02:38.840> full<00:02:39.049> size<00:02:39.290> we<00:02:39.920> have<00:02:40.400> to<00:02:40.549> tile<00:02:40.819> it<00:02:40.970> to

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
at its full size we have to tile it to

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.020 
at its full size we have to tile it to
our<00:02:41.209> media<00:02:41.599> and<00:02:41.920> then<00:02:42.920> if<00:02:43.250> it's<00:02:43.489> only<00:02:43.670> 48

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
our media and then if it's only 48

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.970 
our media and then if it's only 48
inches<00:02:44.330> wide<00:02:44.599> but<00:02:44.900> it's<00:02:45.019> a<00:02:45.080> 16<00:02:45.440> inch<00:02:45.530> job<00:02:45.830> we

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
inches wide but it's a 16 inch job we

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.470 
inches wide but it's a 16 inch job we
might<00:02:46.130> split<00:02:46.400> this<00:02:46.519> in<00:02:46.700> half<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:47.090> say<00:02:47.209> 30

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
might split this in half and say 30

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.390 
might split this in half and say 30
inches<00:02:47.810> wide<00:02:47.870> then<00:02:48.769> we'll<00:02:48.890> set<00:02:49.069> a<00:02:49.099> tile

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
inches wide then we'll set a tile

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.670 
inches wide then we'll set a tile
overlap<00:02:49.819> with<00:02:49.970> say<00:02:50.120> one<00:02:50.360> inch<00:02:50.569> so<00:02:51.500> it'll

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
overlap with say one inch so it'll

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.250 
overlap with say one inch so it'll
that'll<00:02:52.069> actually<00:02:52.400> print<00:02:52.670> it<00:02:52.819> 31<00:02:53.750> inches<00:02:54.110> on

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
that'll actually print it 31 inches on

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.589 
that'll actually print it 31 inches on
each<00:02:54.380> side<00:02:54.410> and<00:02:55.040> then<00:02:55.760> we<00:02:55.849> just<00:02:56.030> overlap<00:02:56.390> it<00:02:56.510> at

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
each side and then we just overlap it at

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.229 
each side and then we just overlap it at
an<00:02:56.690> inch<00:02:56.810> on<00:02:56.989> the<00:02:57.110> job<00:02:57.349> and<00:02:57.940> that<00:02:58.940> should<00:02:59.120> be

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
an inch on the job and that should be

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.240 
an inch on the job and that should be
fine<00:02:59.480> we<00:03:00.200> can<00:03:00.319> also<00:03:00.470> use<00:03:00.709> this<00:03:00.829> little<00:03:01.099> neat

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
fine we can also use this little neat

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.479 
fine we can also use this little neat
feature<00:03:01.489> which<00:03:02.000> gives<00:03:02.390> us<00:03:02.510> a<00:03:03.220> record<00:03:04.220> of<00:03:04.340> what

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
feature which gives us a record of what

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:05.949 
feature which gives us a record of what
we've<00:03:04.640> done<00:03:04.819> it<00:03:05.030> just<00:03:05.180> creates<00:03:05.569> a<00:03:05.750> little

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
we've done it just creates a little

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.780 
we've done it just creates a little
image<00:03:06.500> on<00:03:06.650> a<00:03:06.680> clipboard<00:03:06.920> and<00:03:07.220> you<00:03:07.340> can<00:03:07.489> slide

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
image on a clipboard and you can slide

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.970 
image on a clipboard and you can slide
that<00:03:07.940> into<00:03:08.060> paint<00:03:08.360> like<00:03:08.540> so<00:03:08.840> and<00:03:09.110> keep<00:03:09.769> that<00:03:09.920> in

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
that into paint like so and keep that in

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.890 
that into paint like so and keep that in
the<00:03:10.220> background<00:03:10.610> so<00:03:10.760> you<00:03:10.819> remember<00:03:11.209> how<00:03:11.720> this

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
the background so you remember how this

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.000 
the background so you remember how this
all<00:03:12.049> goes<00:03:12.230> together<00:03:12.410> because<00:03:12.739> you<00:03:12.799> might<00:03:12.950> have

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
all goes together because you might have

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.430 
all goes together because you might have
about<00:03:13.190> having<00:03:13.400> 10<00:03:13.610> pieces<00:03:13.849> or<00:03:14.120> so<00:03:14.329> let's<00:03:15.260> make

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
about having 10 pieces or so let's make

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.000 
about having 10 pieces or so let's make
sure<00:03:15.470> our<00:03:15.920> other<00:03:16.280> settings<00:03:16.700> are<00:03:16.819> correct<00:03:18.010> we

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
sure our other settings are correct we

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.559 
sure our other settings are correct we
can<00:03:19.160> set<00:03:19.430> all<00:03:19.700> sorts<00:03:20.060> of<00:03:20.120> different<00:03:20.329> options

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
can set all sorts of different options

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:22.660 
can set all sorts of different options
here<00:03:20.780> where<00:03:21.170> we<00:03:21.290> position<00:03:21.769> the<00:03:21.889> job<00:03:22.100> etc<00:03:22.250> but

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
here where we position the job etc but

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.160 
here where we position the job etc but
this<00:03:22.850> is<00:03:23.030> all<00:03:23.239> covered<00:03:23.600> in<00:03:23.660> more<00:03:23.870> advanced

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
this is all covered in more advanced

lessons this is just to give you an idea
of<00:03:25.880> how<00:03:26.030> the<00:03:26.090> tile<00:03:26.329> overlay<00:03:26.780> so<00:03:27.500> we<00:03:27.650> click

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
of how the tile overlay so we click

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:30.190 
of how the tile overlay so we click
accept<00:03:28.220> that<00:03:28.880> loads<00:03:29.180> it<00:03:29.329> is<00:03:29.420> two<00:03:29.660> pieces<00:03:29.900> as

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
accept that loads it is two pieces as

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.979 
accept that loads it is two pieces as
you<00:03:30.230> can<00:03:30.470> see<00:03:30.680> directly<00:03:30.980> into<00:03:31.340> the<00:03:31.870> two<00:03:32.870> the

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
you can see directly into the two the

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:34.900 
you can see directly into the two the
route<00:03:33.139> manager<00:03:33.350> so<00:03:34.040> we'll<00:03:34.190> set<00:03:34.340> our<00:03:34.459> meeting

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
route manager so we'll set our meeting

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.180 
route manager so we'll set our meeting
with<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.060> say<00:03:35.299> 48<00:03:35.690> inches<00:03:35.989> and<00:03:36.829> when<00:03:36.950> we<00:03:37.069> go

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
with the say 48 inches and when we go

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.949 
with the say 48 inches and when we go
back<00:03:37.370> to<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:37.579> preview<00:03:37.910> here<00:03:38.000> you'll<00:03:38.389> see<00:03:38.630> that

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
back to the preview here you'll see that

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.050 
back to the preview here you'll see that
we've<00:03:39.109> got<00:03:39.290> the<00:03:39.380> two<00:03:39.530> pieces<00:03:39.560> this<00:03:40.310> is<00:03:40.489> the

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
we've got the two pieces this is the

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.140 
we've got the two pieces this is the
tile<00:03:41.299> 1<00:03:41.510> and<00:03:41.690> tile<00:03:41.870> 2<00:03:42.200> and<00:03:42.769> they<00:03:43.519> said<00:03:43.819> it's<00:03:43.940> a

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
tile 1 and tile 2 and they said it's a

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.680 
tile 1 and tile 2 and they said it's a
32<00:03:45.139> inches<00:03:45.380> apart<00:03:45.709> which<00:03:46.329> allows<00:03:47.329> for<00:03:47.359> the

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
32 inches apart which allows for the

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.410 
32 inches apart which allows for the
overlap<00:03:48.079> and<00:03:48.290> the<00:03:48.430> job<00:03:49.430> information<00:03:50.060> and<00:03:50.269> if

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
overlap and the job information and if

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.940 
overlap and the job information and if
we<00:03:50.540> rotate<00:03:50.930> it<00:03:50.959> you<00:03:51.109> can<00:03:51.230> see<00:03:51.410> it<00:03:51.500> doesn't<00:03:51.650> fit

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
we rotate it you can see it doesn't fit

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.470 
we rotate it you can see it doesn't fit
so<00:03:52.100> we've<00:03:52.220> got<00:03:52.400> to<00:03:52.489> keep<00:03:52.609> it<00:03:52.790> like<00:03:52.970> this<00:03:53.000> and

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
so we've got to keep it like this and

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.410 
so we've got to keep it like this and
we'd<00:03:54.139> print<00:03:54.380> it<00:03:54.440> in<00:03:54.590> two<00:03:54.799> pieces<00:03:55.120> we<00:03:56.120> can<00:03:56.269> set

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
we'd print it in two pieces we can set

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.640 
we'd print it in two pieces we can set
our<00:03:56.540> margins<00:03:56.930> if<00:03:57.049> we<00:03:57.139> want<00:03:57.319> to<00:03:57.349> offset

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
our margins if we want to offset

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.089 
our margins if we want to offset
everything<00:03:58.069> a<00:03:58.130> little<00:03:58.220> bit<00:03:58.370> like<00:03:58.819> so<00:03:59.920> so<00:04:00.920> once

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
everything a little bit like so so once

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.390 
everything a little bit like so so once
we're<00:04:01.250> happy<00:04:01.340> with<00:04:01.579> that<00:04:02.650> we<00:04:03.650> can<00:04:03.829> add<00:04:04.160> things

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
we're happy with that we can add things

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.870 
we're happy with that we can add things
like<00:04:04.549> crop<00:04:04.880> marks<00:04:05.329> and<00:04:06.190> other<00:04:07.190> job<00:04:07.519> options

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
like crop marks and other job options

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.670 
like crop marks and other job options
that<00:04:08.000> we<00:04:08.180> may<00:04:08.510> want<00:04:08.780> to<00:04:08.840> do<00:04:09.019> like<00:04:09.230> that<00:04:09.410> job

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680

so once the artwork is ready to go make

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.920 
so once the artwork is ready to go make
sure<00:04:39.280> again<00:04:39.400> that<00:04:39.730> your<00:04:39.910> media<00:04:40.240> profile<00:04:40.780> is

correct in your your print mode and then

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.150 
correct in your your print mode and then
you<00:04:45.490> can<00:04:45.640> rip<00:04:45.820> that<00:04:45.970> job<00:04:46.240> like<00:04:46.450> so<00:04:46.980> and<00:04:47.980> go<00:04:48.100> to

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
you can rip that job like so and go to

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.950 
you can rip that job like so and go to
the<00:04:48.280> job<00:04:48.490> queue<00:04:48.730> and<00:04:49.060> that's<00:04:49.300> waiting<00:04:49.570> to<00:04:49.780> rip

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
the job queue and that's waiting to rip

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.570 
the job queue and that's waiting to rip
you'd<00:04:50.230> click<00:04:50.470> rip<00:04:50.680> now<00:04:50.920> it<00:04:51.310> would<00:04:51.490> obviously

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
you'd click rip now it would obviously

we're going to do is change it to a
large<00:05:20.230> format<00:05:20.620> printer<00:05:20.920> cutter<00:05:21.130> which<00:05:21.520> is

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:21.670 
large format printer cutter which is

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.480 
large format printer cutter which is
this<00:05:21.820> VDS<00:05:22.150> 640<00:05:22.720> here<00:05:22.960> now<00:05:23.770> it's<00:05:24.040> important<00:05:24.460> to

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
this VDS 640 here now it's important to

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.010 
this VDS 640 here now it's important to
change<00:05:24.700> the<00:05:24.850> method<00:05:25.120> to<00:05:25.330> print<00:05:25.540> and<00:05:25.690> cut<00:05:25.840> and

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
change the method to print and cut and

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.790 
change the method to print and cut and
you'll<00:05:26.140> see<00:05:26.290> the<00:05:26.440> preview<00:05:26.650> change<00:05:27.130> like<00:05:27.430> so

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
you'll see the preview change like so

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.900 
you'll see the preview change like so
obviously<00:05:29.800> we<00:05:29.920> notice<00:05:30.130> that<00:05:30.190> other<00:05:30.340> options

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
obviously we notice that other options

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.130 
obviously we notice that other options
but<00:05:31.030> for<00:05:31.210> now<00:05:31.300> we'll<00:05:31.480> just<00:05:31.510> send<00:05:31.960> it<00:05:32.080> straight

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.140 
but for now we'll just send it straight

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.320 
but for now we'll just send it straight
to<00:05:32.320> the<00:05:32.530> rip<00:05:32.710> and<00:05:32.980> you<00:05:33.250> can<00:05:33.400> see<00:05:33.610> that<00:05:33.850> it's<00:05:34.150> now

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
to the rip and you can see that it's now

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.690 
to the rip and you can see that it's now
got<00:05:34.660> a<00:05:34.720> different<00:05:35.080> icon<00:05:35.440> there<00:05:35.680> and<00:05:35.800> we<00:05:36.550> can

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:36.700 
got a different icon there and we can

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.490 
got a different icon there and we can
change<00:05:36.940> the<00:05:37.330> print<00:05:37.690> method<00:05:37.840> here<00:05:38.110> to<00:05:38.200> printing

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
change the print method here to printing

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.540 
change the print method here to printing
the<00:05:38.530> cut<00:05:38.710> and<00:05:38.890> you'll<00:05:39.010> see<00:05:39.160> the<00:05:39.310> preview

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
the cut and you'll see the preview

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.900 
the cut and you'll see the preview
updates<00:05:40.090> to<00:05:40.510> show<00:05:40.720> us<00:05:40.900> that<00:05:41.080> so<00:05:42.070> the<00:05:42.550> program

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
updates to show us that so the program

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.060 
updates to show us that so the program
knows<00:05:43.090> that<00:05:43.330> we're<00:05:43.480> going<00:05:43.690> to<00:05:43.840> print<00:05:44.770> and<00:05:44.920> cut

talking about before here we can look at
our<00:06:31.930> media<00:06:32.500> profiles<00:06:33.070> and<00:06:33.340> how<00:06:33.370> many<00:06:33.640> profiles

our media profiles and how many profiles

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.700 
our media profiles and how many profiles
work<00:06:34.450> it's<00:06:34.720> very<00:06:34.750> important<00:06:35.230> you<00:06:35.260> understand

section and explains to you how these
different<00:07:07.120> rendering<00:07:07.540> intents<00:07:07.930> actually

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:08.260 
different rendering intents actually

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.950 
different rendering intents actually
work<00:07:08.790> that's<00:07:09.790> basically<00:07:10.180> the<00:07:10.390> outline<00:07:10.510> of<00:07:10.720> how

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:10.960 
work that's basically the outline of how

work that's basically the outline of how
to<00:07:11.020> do<00:07:11.200> quick<00:07:11.470> printing<00:07:12.280> and<00:07:12.520> print<00:07:13.090> and<00:07:13.210> cut

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:13.390 
to do quick printing and print and cut

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:17.100 
to do quick printing and print and cut
that's<00:07:13.840> into<00:07:14.050> this<00:07:14.170> lesson<00:07:14.500> thanks
