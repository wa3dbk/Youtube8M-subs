00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.590 
mountains are about 16 miles away and
right<00:04:24.190> now<00:04:24.370> you're<00:04:24.580> looking<00:04:24.729> at<00:04:24.969> downtown

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
right now you're looking at downtown

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:31.860 
right now you're looking at downtown
versus<00:04:26.290> and<00:04:27.100> as<00:04:27.760> we<00:04:28.180> move<00:04:28.390> on<00:04:30.330> we<00:04:31.330> will<00:04:31.570> be

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
versus and as we move on we will be

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:42.450 
versus and as we move on we will be
swinging<00:04:32.170> directly<00:04:32.980> to<00:04:33.370> the<00:04:33.520> east<00:04:40.950> and<00:04:41.950> right

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
swinging directly to the east and right

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.910 
swinging directly to the east and right
there<00:04:42.850> I<00:04:42.880> believe<00:04:43.270> is<00:04:43.930> what's<00:04:44.200> called<00:04:44.500> a

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:44.920 
there I believe is what's called a

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.850 
there I believe is what's called a
mountain<00:04:45.520> and<00:04:45.810> it's<00:04:46.810> called<00:04:47.320> a<00:04:47.530> mountain

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
mountain and it's called a mountain

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.490 
mountain and it's called a mountain
because<00:04:48.760> it's<00:04:49.000> got<00:04:49.150> a<00:04:49.180> great<00:04:49.420> big<00:04:49.720> a<00:04:49.990> on<00:04:50.050> the

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
because it's got a great big a on the

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.060 
because it's got a great big a on the
top<00:04:50.680> of<00:04:50.920> it<00:04:51.070> I<00:04:51.370> think<00:04:52.030> you<00:04:52.150> can<00:04:52.210> see<00:04:52.540> it<00:04:52.660> there

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
top of it I think you can see it there

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.700 
top of it I think you can see it there
and<00:04:54.070> the<00:04:54.970> reason<00:04:55.180> for<00:04:55.390> the<00:04:55.690> a<00:04:55.720> on<00:04:56.140> the<00:04:56.290> top<00:04:56.500> of

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
and the reason for the a on the top of

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.750 
and the reason for the a on the top of
it<00:04:56.860> is<00:04:57.100> because<00:04:58.000> we<00:04:58.720> got<00:04:59.320> the<00:04:59.500> Aggies<00:05:00.010> New

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
it is because we got the Aggies New

00:06:58.739 --> 00:06:58.749 
like real tight property owners

00:06:58.749 --> 00:07:00.449 
like real tight property owners
associations<00:06:59.499> today<00:06:59.799> because<00:07:00.129> they<00:07:00.279> just

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:00.459 
associations today because they just

00:07:00.459 --> 00:07:02.729 
associations today because they just
virtually<00:07:00.969> all<00:07:01.119> get<00:07:01.359> out<00:07:01.509> of<00:07:01.659> control<00:07:02.109> by

00:07:02.729 --> 00:07:02.739 
virtually all get out of control by

00:07:02.739 --> 00:07:05.069 
virtually all get out of control by
do-gooders<00:07:03.399> who<00:07:03.639> want<00:07:03.879> to<00:07:03.999> protect<00:07:04.419> property

00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:05.079

values<00:07:05.469> and<00:07:05.709> they<00:07:05.799> essentially<00:07:06.279> end<00:07:06.429> up

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:06.609 
values and they essentially end up

00:07:06.609 --> 00:07:09.269 
values and they essentially end up
wrecking<00:07:06.999> them<00:07:07.179> so<00:07:08.019> that's<00:07:08.559> very<00:07:08.709> relaxed

00:07:09.269 --> 00:07:09.279 
wrecking them so that's very relaxed

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:11.279 
wrecking them so that's very relaxed
there<00:07:09.459> and<00:07:09.609> lots<00:07:09.819> of<00:07:09.969> lots<00:07:10.509> can<00:07:10.839> be<00:07:10.929> easily

00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:11.289 
there and lots of lots can be easily

00:07:11.289 --> 00:07:13.529 
there and lots of lots can be easily
sold<00:07:11.589> in<00:07:11.829> there<00:07:12.009> because<00:07:12.339> of<00:07:12.489> that<00:07:12.669> and<00:07:12.939> then

00:07:13.529 --> 00:07:13.539 
sold in there because of that and then

00:07:13.539 --> 00:07:17.959 
sold in there because of that and then
as<00:07:13.749> we<00:07:13.959> move<00:07:14.199> on<00:07:14.469> we<00:07:15.329> pick<00:07:16.329> up<00:07:16.509> the<00:07:16.749> the<00:07:16.779> seventh

00:07:17.959 --> 00:07:17.969 
as we move on we pick up the the seventh

00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:20.249 
as we move on we pick up the the seventh
mountain<00:07:18.969> range<00:07:19.239> of<00:07:19.509> the<00:07:19.629> seven<00:07:19.959> mountain

ranges<00:07:20.619> in<00:07:20.829> the<00:07:21.129> area<00:07:21.519> and<00:07:21.699> we're<00:07:22.269> almost

00:07:22.739 --> 00:07:22.749 
ranges in the area and we're almost

00:07:22.749 --> 00:07:25.529 
ranges in the area and we're almost
directly<00:07:23.289> south<00:07:23.649> and<00:07:24.249> if<00:07:24.669> you<00:07:24.819> went<00:07:25.029> over<00:07:25.389> that

Ridge and continued on about another 40

00:07:28.539 --> 00:07:30.929 
Ridge and continued on about another 40
to<00:07:28.659> 45<00:07:29.169> miles<00:07:29.439> you'd<00:07:30.189> be<00:07:30.369> right<00:07:30.579> in<00:07:30.789> the<00:07:30.909> heart
