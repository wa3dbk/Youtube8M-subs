00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.590 
but when you compress the round wire
spring<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.860> solid<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.910> flat<00:00:39.120> wire<00:00:39.329> spring

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
to so tight you're gonna see that the

to so tight you're gonna see that the
difference<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.510> stark<00:00:43.309> here's<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.399> round<00:00:44.670> wire

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
difference is stark here's a round wire

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.029 
difference is stark here's a round wire
compressed<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.870> solid<00:00:46.140> height<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.800> here's<00:00:46.980> a

compressed to solid height and here's a

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.220 
compressed to solid height and here's a
flat<00:00:47.340> wire<00:00:47.579> compressed<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.090> solid<00:00:48.390> ice<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:49.140> if

flat wire compressed to solid ice and if

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.650 
flat wire compressed to solid ice and if
you<00:00:49.350> notice<00:00:49.649> where<00:00:49.829> they<00:00:49.980> end<00:00:50.250> it's<00:00:50.850> way<00:00:51.629> more

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
you notice where they end it's way more

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.049 
you notice where they end it's way more
than<00:00:52.020> half<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.980> width<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.399> cartridge<00:00:53.789> case

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
than half the width of a cartridge case

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.049 
than half the width of a cartridge case
in<00:00:54.300> height<00:00:54.710> the<00:00:55.710> thickness<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.280> just

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
in height the thickness of it just

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.849 
in height the thickness of it just
assume<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.600> it's<00:00:57.750> very<00:00:58.020> close<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.410> this

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
assume that it's very close to this

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.279 
assume that it's very close to this
amount<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.789> height<00:01:00.030> difference<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:01.140> what

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
amount and height difference so what

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.170 
amount and height difference so what
you'll<00:01:01.559> see<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.949> it's<00:01:02.100> very<00:01:02.160> easy<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.879> get<00:01:03.030> at

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
you'll see that it's very easy to get at

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.939 
you'll see that it's very easy to get at
least<00:01:03.300> two<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.780> sometimes<00:01:03.989> three<00:01:04.229> rounds<00:01:04.860> of

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
least two and sometimes three rounds of

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.370 
least two and sometimes three rounds of
it<00:01:05.070> when<00:01:05.610> but<00:01:05.820> make<00:01:06.150> with<00:01:06.450> basically<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.200> same

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
it when but make with basically the same

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.370 
it when but make with basically the same
coiling<00:01:07.830> stress<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.570> know<00:01:09.570> most<00:01:09.780> people<00:01:09.930> take<00:01:10.320> a

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
coiling stress I know most people take a

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.429 
coiling stress I know most people take a
round<00:01:11.310> wire<00:01:11.670> spring<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.330> low<00:01:12.450> 28<00:01:12.930> rounds<00:01:13.170> in

round wire spring and low 28 rounds in
it<00:01:13.470> when<00:01:13.680> it'll<00:01:13.860> hold<00:01:14.010> 30<00:01:14.280> well<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.570> can<00:01:15.720> take

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
it when it'll hold 30 well you can take

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.260 
it when it'll hold 30 well you can take
this<00:01:16.140> one<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.890> can<00:01:16.920> load<00:01:17.280> 32<00:01:17.820> in<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.150> I'm

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
this one and you can load 32 in it I'm

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.960 
this one and you can load 32 in it I'm
sorry<00:01:18.540> 30<00:01:18.869> in<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.170> will<00:01:19.290> hold<00:01:19.530> 32<00:01:19.979> with<00:01:20.700> the

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
sorry 30 in it will hold 32 with the

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.280 
sorry 30 in it will hold 32 with the
same<00:01:21.240> coiling<00:01:21.720> stories

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
same coiling stories

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.070 
same coiling stories
now<00:01:22.860> while<00:01:23.759> that's<00:01:23.939> all<00:01:24.180> well<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.509> important

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
now while that's all well and important

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.570 
now while that's all well and important
the<00:01:25.200> fact<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.500> we<00:01:25.590> can<00:01:25.740> hold<00:01:25.920> more<00:01:26.130> rounds

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
the fact that we can hold more rounds

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.319 
the fact that we can hold more rounds
what<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.540> what<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.619> feel<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:29.220> really<00:01:29.880> important

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
what is what I feel is really important

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.510 
what is what I feel is really important
we're<00:01:30.840> gonna<00:01:30.990> use<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.170> spring<00:01:31.650> or<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.009> load

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
we're gonna use a spring or a load

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.620 
we're gonna use a spring or a load
sensor<00:01:33.000> for<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.329> is<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.079> fact<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:35.630> the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
sensor for this is the fact that the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.280 
sensor for this is the fact that the
last<00:01:37.439> 10<00:01:37.770> rounds<00:01:38.340> in<00:01:38.460> an<00:01:38.700> ar-15<00:01:39.180> magazine<00:01:39.930> or

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
last 10 rounds in an ar-15 magazine or

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.980 
last 10 rounds in an ar-15 magazine or
typically<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.040> ones<00:01:41.280> with<00:01:41.610> cause<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.329> give

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
typically the ones with cause and give

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.060 
typically the ones with cause and give
the<00:01:43.590> jamming<00:01:44.490> problems<00:01:44.939> right<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:46.320> Ted

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
the jamming problems right and so Ted

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.370 
the jamming problems right and so Ted
don't<00:01:47.280> want<00:01:47.490> tests<00:01:47.850> here<00:01:48.030> typically<00:01:48.899> this<00:01:49.170> and

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
don't want tests here typically this and

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.649 
don't want tests here typically this and
this<00:01:49.560> one<00:01:49.770> shows<00:01:49.979> this<00:01:50.250> usually<00:01:51.030> shows<00:01:51.240> up<00:01:51.270> at

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
this one shows this usually shows up at

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.399 
this one shows this usually shows up at
3<00:01:51.930> or<00:01:52.140> 3.1<00:01:53.040> pounds<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.700> load<00:01:54.600> at<00:01:54.930> what<00:01:55.079> I<00:01:55.110> would

call installed height or position one

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.380 
call installed height or position one

and there are substandard materials why

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.130 
and there are substandard materials why
are<00:02:20.010> just<00:02:20.340> compared<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:21.560> 17-7<00:02:24.140> they're

round in the feeding position when

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.250 
round in the feeding position when
you're<00:02:29.370> shooting<00:02:29.640> in<00:02:29.940> that<00:02:30.120> bolt<00:02:30.360> is<00:02:30.540> racing

you're shooting in that bolt is racing

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.090 
you're shooting in that bolt is racing
back<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:31.650> forth<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.130> so<00:02:32.640> consequently<00:02:33.150> the

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
an insert the flat wire spring back into

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.430 
an insert the flat wire spring back into
the<00:03:25.040> test<00:03:26.040> fixture<00:03:26.780> turn<00:03:27.780> this<00:03:27.930> just<00:03:28.200> a<00:03:28.320> little

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
the test fixture turn this just a little

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.729 
the test fixture turn this just a little
bit<00:03:29.959> okay<00:03:30.989> and<00:03:31.680> it<00:03:31.800> shows<00:03:32.750> 6.0<00:03:33.750> low<00:03:34.290> so<00:03:34.590> it

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
bit okay and it shows 6.0 low so it

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.979 
bit okay and it shows 6.0 low so it
shows<00:03:35.010> a<00:03:35.040> pound<00:03:35.550> and<00:03:35.760> a<00:03:35.820> half<00:03:35.850> more<00:03:36.390> load<00:03:36.660> with

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
shows a pound and a half more load with

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.949 
shows a pound and a half more load with
now<00:03:37.200> nine<00:03:37.680> rounds<00:03:37.950> in<00:03:38.310> which<00:03:38.940> is<00:03:39.150> basically<00:03:39.660> if

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
now nine rounds in which is basically if

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.190 
now nine rounds in which is basically if
upwards<00:03:40.890> of<00:03:41.040> 20<00:03:41.370> percent<00:03:41.820> more<00:03:42.120> load<00:03:42.450> at

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
upwards of 20 percent more load at

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.800 
upwards of 20 percent more load at
height<00:03:43.560> now<00:03:44.519> when<00:03:44.880> we<00:03:44.970> go<00:03:45.120> in<00:03:45.300> and<00:03:45.420> we<00:03:45.480> strip

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
height now when we go in and we strip

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.770 
height now when we go in and we strip
these<00:03:45.989> off<00:03:46.230> down<00:03:46.709> to<00:03:46.739> the<00:03:46.950> last<00:03:47.220> round<00:03:47.780> so

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
these off down to the last round so

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.210 
these off down to the last round so
you're<00:03:48.930> shooting<00:03:51.080> you're<00:03:52.080> gonna<00:03:52.230> see<00:03:52.470> is<00:03:53.040> the

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
you're shooting you're gonna see is the

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.440 
you're shooting you're gonna see is the
last<00:03:53.550> round<00:03:53.850> is<00:03:54.269> at<00:03:54.540> 4.45<00:03:55.790> and<00:03:56.790> it<00:03:56.910> started<00:03:57.330> at

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
last round is at 4.45 and it started at

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.340 
last round is at 4.45 and it started at
three<00:03:57.750> pounds<00:03:58.130> so<00:03:59.130> essentially<00:03:59.940> this<00:04:00.600> spring

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
three pounds so essentially this spring

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.979 
three pounds so essentially this spring
had<00:04:01.950> installed<00:04:02.430> height<00:04:02.820> or<00:04:03.150> with<00:04:03.360> them<00:04:03.510> with

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
had installed height or with them with

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.840 
had installed height or with them with
the<00:04:04.110> magazine<00:04:04.680> all<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.130> way<00:04:05.250> the<00:04:05.430> top<00:04:05.640> with

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
the magazine all the way the top with

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.560 
the magazine all the way the top with
one<00:04:06.090> round<00:04:06.330> has<00:04:06.600> 50%<00:04:07.560> more<00:04:08.100> vertical<00:04:09.000> load<00:04:09.239> and

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
one round has 50% more vertical load and

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.070 
one round has 50% more vertical load and
has<00:04:10.110> the<00:04:10.320> ability<00:04:10.380> to<00:04:10.680> put<00:04:10.890> the<00:04:11.010> bullet<00:04:11.280> in

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
has the ability to put the bullet in

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.300

where<00:04:13.080> it<00:04:13.200> should<00:04:13.410> be<00:04:13.440> so<00:04:13.740> it's<00:04:14.040> going<00:04:14.190> to

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
where it should be so it's going to

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.190 
where it should be so it's going to
reduce<00:04:14.430> your<00:04:14.640> jams<00:04:15.150> and<00:04:15.420> not<00:04:16.020> only<00:04:16.289> that

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
reduce your jams and not only that

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.120 
reduce your jams and not only that
but<00:04:17.320> it's<00:04:17.860> going<00:04:18.160> to<00:04:18.330> be<00:04:19.330> with<00:04:19.630> the<00:04:19.810> the<00:04:20.770> that

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
but it's going to be with the the that

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.770 
but it's going to be with the the that
you<00:04:21.250> can<00:04:21.430> even<00:04:21.820> assume<00:04:22.090> the<00:04:22.240> qualities<00:04:22.750> of

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
you can even assume the qualities of

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.950 
you can even assume the qualities of
this<00:04:23.140> is<00:04:23.590> you<00:04:23.890> can<00:04:24.130> load<00:04:24.340> a<00:04:24.370> mag<00:04:24.670> to<00:04:24.940> 32<00:04:25.450> or<00:04:25.660> 33

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
this is you can load a mag to 32 or 33

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.310 
this is you can load a mag to 32 or 33
rounds<00:04:26.380> and<00:04:26.770> it<00:04:27.280> really<00:04:27.760> doesn't<00:04:28.540> affect<00:04:28.690> the

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
rounds and it really doesn't affect the

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.090

produced in our first run we're actually
already<00:04:37.930> into<00:04:38.260> our<00:04:38.380> second<00:04:38.740> one<00:04:38.860> of<00:04:38.980> these<00:04:39.070> you

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
already into our second one of these you

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.250 
already into our second one of these you
notice<00:04:39.850> this<00:04:39.940> has<00:04:40.000> a<00:04:40.150> little<00:04:40.270> yellow<00:04:40.780> paint<00:04:41.140> on

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
notice this has a little yellow paint on

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.190 
notice this has a little yellow paint on
it<00:04:41.440> and<00:04:41.530> this<00:04:41.590> one<00:04:41.800> doesn't<00:04:42.570> when<00:04:43.570> I<00:04:43.600> put<00:04:43.990> these

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
it and this one doesn't when I put these

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.990 
it and this one doesn't when I put these
in<00:04:44.260> and<00:04:44.770> you'll<00:04:44.860> sees<00:04:45.100> notice<00:04:45.490> if<00:04:45.640> I<00:04:45.700> hold<00:04:45.850> them

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
in and you'll sees notice if I hold them

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.820 
in and you'll sees notice if I hold them
side<00:04:46.180> by<00:04:46.240> side<00:04:46.390> they're<00:04:46.960> virtually<00:04:47.530> the<00:04:47.800> same

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
side by side they're virtually the same

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.220 
side by side they're virtually the same
height<00:04:48.280> okay<00:04:48.760> this<00:04:49.510> one's<00:04:49.720> just<00:04:49.810> slightly

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
height okay this one's just slightly

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.320 
height okay this one's just slightly
shorter<00:04:50.740> mm-hmm<00:04:51.280> or<00:04:51.430> should<00:04:51.610> I<00:04:51.640> say<00:04:51.820> mine<00:04:52.030> okay

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
shorter mm-hmm or should I say mine okay

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.570 
shorter mm-hmm or should I say mine okay
that's<00:04:52.990> to<00:04:53.200> take<00:04:53.380> in<00:04:53.500> a<00:04:53.590> set<00:04:53.770> board<00:04:54.010> but<00:04:54.430> when<00:04:54.550> I

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
that's to take in a set board but when I

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.030 
that's to take in a set board but when I
put<00:04:54.880> these<00:04:55.000> on<00:04:55.060> my<00:04:55.300> load<00:04:55.540> sensor<00:04:55.960> mm-hmm<00:04:56.860> and

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
put these on my load sensor mm-hmm and

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:02.190 
put these on my load sensor mm-hmm and
when<00:04:57.250> I<00:04:57.280> I<00:04:57.670> do<00:04:58.420> this<00:04:58.660> one<00:05:00.690> this<00:05:01.690> one<00:05:01.960> showed

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
when I I do this one this one showed

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.920 
when I I do this one this one showed
four<00:05:02.530> point<00:05:02.800> two<00:05:03.130> pounds<00:05:04.090> of<00:05:04.240> vertical<00:05:04.750> load

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
four point two pounds of vertical load

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.870 
four point two pounds of vertical load
and<00:05:05.230> this<00:05:05.650> one<00:05:05.830> showed<00:05:06.040> four<00:05:06.310> point<00:05:06.640> four

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
and this one showed four point four

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.310 
and this one showed four point four
pounds<00:05:07.150> of<00:05:07.390> vertical<00:05:07.750> of<00:05:07.870> never<00:05:08.110> been

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
pounds of vertical of never been

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.200 
pounds of vertical of never been
compressed<00:05:08.700> if<00:05:09.700> you<00:05:09.760> do<00:05:09.880> the<00:05:10.000> math

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
compressed if you do the math

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.850 
compressed if you do the math
calculations<00:05:10.990> on<00:05:11.140> that<00:05:11.350> that's

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
calculations on that that's

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.120 
calculations on that that's
approximately<00:05:12.370> a<00:05:12.940> two<00:05:13.210> percent<00:05:13.630> loss<00:05:13.930> in

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
approximately a two percent loss in

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:19.200 
approximately a two percent loss in
spring<00:05:15.130> load<00:05:16.110> and<00:05:17.400> the<00:05:18.400> surprising<00:05:18.970> thing<00:05:19.000> is

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
spring load and the surprising thing is

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.830 
spring load and the surprising thing is
is<00:05:19.660> this<00:05:20.590> spring<00:05:20.920> was<00:05:21.190> loaded<00:05:21.670> in<00:05:21.880> a<00:05:21.970> PMAG<00:05:22.360> with

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
is this spring was loaded in a PMAG with

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.590 
is this spring was loaded in a PMAG with
33<00:05:23.650> rounds<00:05:23.920> which<00:05:24.520> basically<00:05:24.970> takes<00:05:25.330> it<00:05:25.480> to

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 
33 rounds which basically takes it to

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.770 
33 rounds which basically takes it to
solid<00:05:25.900> height<00:05:26.050> and<00:05:26.550> left<00:05:27.550> for<00:05:27.940> a<00:05:27.970> sitting<00:05:28.510> in<00:05:28.660> a

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
solid height and left for a sitting in a

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.710 
solid height and left for a sitting in a
left<00:05:29.410> sitting<00:05:29.650> for<00:05:29.920> a<00:05:29.950> year<00:05:30.340> right<00:05:30.790> so<00:05:31.000> that

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 
left sitting for a year right so that

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.810 
left sitting for a year right so that
that<00:05:32.350> tells<00:05:32.620> you<00:05:32.830> is<00:05:32.980> you<00:05:33.130> can<00:05:33.310> load<00:05:33.460> your<00:05:33.490> mags

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
that tells you is you can load your mags

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.700 
that tells you is you can load your mags
up<00:05:34.030> with<00:05:34.210> 32<00:05:34.600> rounds<00:05:34.810> we<00:05:35.080> use<00:05:35.230> in<00:05:35.350> one<00:05:35.500> of<00:05:35.590> these

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710
