inside of it so you can expect to get

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.090 
inside of it so you can expect to get
around<00:02:51.760> 12<00:02:52.090> hours<00:02:52.420> of<00:02:52.450> light<00:02:52.810> to<00:02:53.350> moderate<00:02:53.830> use

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
around 12 hours of light to moderate use

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.060 
around 12 hours of light to moderate use
from<00:02:54.340> it<00:02:54.460> easily<00:02:55.060> luster<00:02:55.780> knew<00:02:55.960> all<00:02:56.200> day<00:02:56.530> so

from it easily luster knew all day so
that's<00:02:57.400> a<00:02:57.610> plus<00:02:57.940> for<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:58.720> battery<00:02:59.140> life<00:02:59.320> and

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
that's a plus for the battery life and

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.860

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
a bad device at all for the price but

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.140 
a bad device at all for the price but
it's<00:04:05.740> made<00:04:05.920> of<00:04:05.950> a<00:04:06.190> high<00:04:06.430> selling<00:04:06.730> point<00:04:07.030> with

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
it's made of a high selling point with

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.030 
it's made of a high selling point with
it<00:04:07.300> being<00:04:07.480> waterproof<00:04:07.900> is<00:04:08.350> true<00:04:08.740> to<00:04:08.920> a<00:04:08.950> certain

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
it being waterproof is true to a certain

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.100 
it being waterproof is true to a certain
extent<00:04:09.400> but<00:04:09.940> it<00:04:10.060> is<00:04:10.180> seriously<00:04:10.750> flawed

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
extent but it is seriously flawed

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.440 
extent but it is seriously flawed
another<00:04:12.070> drawback<00:04:12.310> is<00:04:12.670> that<00:04:12.850> it<00:04:13.000> only<00:04:13.180> has

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
another drawback is that it only has

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.900 
another drawback is that it only has
eight<00:04:13.810> gig<00:04:14.200> of<00:04:14.410> internal<00:04:15.280> memory<00:04:15.610> there<00:04:15.760> is<00:04:15.880> a

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
eight gig of internal memory there is a

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.390 
eight gig of internal memory there is a
card<00:04:16.210> slot<00:04:16.420> there<00:04:16.780> to<00:04:17.020> extend<00:04:17.560> but<00:04:18.130> that<00:04:18.280> is

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
card slot there to extend but that is

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.849 
card slot there to extend but that is
just<00:04:18.700> too<00:04:18.910> low<00:04:19.180> nowadays<00:04:19.690> for<00:04:19.960> anybody<00:04:20.560> in<00:04:20.710> my

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
just too low nowadays for anybody in my

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.710 
just too low nowadays for anybody in my
opinion<00:04:21.280> I<00:04:21.430> think<00:04:21.700> this<00:04:22.060> would<00:04:22.240> be<00:04:22.270> a<00:04:22.419> really

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
opinion I think this would be a really

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.650 
opinion I think this would be a really
good<00:04:22.990> device<00:04:23.320> for<00:04:23.620> somebody<00:04:24.130> on<00:04:24.340> a<00:04:24.400> budget
