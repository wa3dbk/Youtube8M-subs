right<00:02:25.379> now<00:02:25.409> this<00:02:25.739> thing<00:02:25.920> has<00:02:25.980> been<00:02:26.159> zigzagging

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
right now this thing has been zigzagging

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.220 
right now this thing has been zigzagging
back<00:02:26.879> and<00:02:27.060> forth<00:02:27.480> as<00:02:27.659> it's<00:02:27.810> taking<00:02:28.110> its

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
back and forth as it's taking its

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.839 
back and forth as it's taking its
northeasterly<00:02:28.799> track<00:02:28.920> as<00:02:29.370> you<00:02:29.459> can<00:02:29.579> see<00:02:29.730> it's

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
northeasterly track as you can see it's

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.009 
northeasterly track as you can see it's
gone<00:02:29.970> through<00:02:30.209> a<00:02:30.299> wooded<00:02:30.569> area<00:02:30.689> out<00:02:30.989> there

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
gone through a wooded area out there

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.690 
gone through a wooded area out there
there<00:02:31.379> are<00:02:31.470> also<00:02:31.560> some<00:02:31.920> branches<00:02:32.370> out<00:02:32.519> in<00:02:32.609> this

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
there are also some branches out in this

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.690 
there are also some branches out in this
area<00:02:32.939> as<00:02:33.120> well<00:02:33.269> look<00:02:33.480> at<00:02:33.569> it<00:02:33.659> right<00:02:33.750> now

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
area as well look at it right now

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.610 
area as well look at it right now
so<00:02:35.700> obviously<00:02:35.970> hits<00:02:36.209> some<00:02:36.420> sort<00:02:36.659> of<00:02:36.720> trees<00:02:36.989> you

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
so obviously hits some sort of trees you

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.140 
so obviously hits some sort of trees you
can<00:02:37.739> see<00:02:37.859> the<00:02:37.950> trees<00:02:38.189> flying<00:02:38.519> up<00:02:38.760> into<00:02:38.939> the<00:02:39.030> air

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
can see the trees flying up into the air

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.030 
can see the trees flying up into the air
let's<00:02:39.840> just<00:02:40.019> hope<00:02:40.140> there's<00:02:40.349> no<00:02:40.470> homes<00:02:40.739> in<00:02:40.980> the

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
let's just hope there's no homes in the

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.559 
let's just hope there's no homes in the
path<00:02:41.250> of<00:02:41.459> this<00:02:41.549> thing<00:02:41.760> at<00:02:41.879> this<00:02:42.000> point<00:02:42.299> in<00:02:42.390> time

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
path of this thing at this point in time

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.929 
path of this thing at this point in time
fishing<00:02:43.290> see<00:02:43.560> it's<00:02:43.680> really<00:02:43.950> roped<00:02:44.280> on<00:02:44.459> this<00:02:44.730> is
