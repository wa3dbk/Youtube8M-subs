00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.469 
smoky eye basically originates we have
the<00:01:42.410> sheer<00:01:42.650> base<00:01:42.830> of<00:01:43.040> color<00:01:43.250> so<00:01:43.610> there<00:01:43.940> most<00:01:44.270> of

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
the sheer base of color so there most of

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:45.490 
the sheer base of color so there most of
your<00:01:44.630> work<00:01:44.750> is<00:01:44.930> done

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
your work is done

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.200 
your work is done
so<00:01:45.890> now<00:01:46.010> we're<00:01:46.190> gonna<00:01:46.250> go<00:01:46.460> back<00:01:46.640> in<00:01:46.940> with

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
so now we're gonna go back in with

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.930 
so now we're gonna go back in with
obsidian<00:01:47.780> which<00:01:48.170> is<00:01:48.320> it<00:01:48.620> is<00:01:48.950> probably<00:01:49.640> one<00:01:49.910> of

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
obsidian which is it is probably one of

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.210 
obsidian which is it is probably one of
the<00:01:50.030> best<00:01:50.360> shadow<00:01:51.260> colors<00:01:51.590> that<00:01:51.740> we<00:01:51.830> have<00:01:52.040> for

the best shadow colors that we have for

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.560 
the best shadow colors that we have for

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.690 
of smolder in the last
now<00:03:17.320> another<00:03:17.530> trick<00:03:17.710> is<00:03:17.890> -<00:03:18.070> if<00:03:18.220> I<00:03:18.340> were<00:03:18.520> to<00:03:18.610> go

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
now another trick is - if I were to go

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.640 
now another trick is - if I were to go
back<00:03:18.910> and<00:03:19.120> forth<00:03:19.420> back<00:03:19.840> and<00:03:19.870> forth<00:03:20.140> back<00:03:20.440> and

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
back and forth back and forth back and

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.440 
back and forth back and forth back and
forth<00:03:20.890> she's<00:03:21.550> gonna<00:03:21.670> get<00:03:21.850> that<00:03:21.940> hard<00:03:22.240> line

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
forth she's gonna get that hard line

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.780 
forth she's gonna get that hard line
under<00:03:22.780> I<00:03:22.810> so<00:03:23.530> what<00:03:23.680> I<00:03:23.710> do<00:03:23.830> is<00:03:24.130> I<00:03:24.220> actually<00:03:24.400> take

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
under I so what I do is I actually take

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.760 
under I so what I do is I actually take
the<00:03:24.970> brush<00:03:25.210> and<00:03:25.600> kind<00:03:26.050> of<00:03:26.170> do<00:03:26.320> a<00:03:26.350> little<00:03:26.530> cross

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
the brush and kind of do a little cross

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.710 
the brush and kind of do a little cross
hatching<00:03:27.280> motions<00:03:27.700> down<00:03:27.940> underneath<00:03:28.330> and

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
hatching motions down underneath and

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.140 
hatching motions down underneath and
bring<00:03:29.290> the<00:03:29.440> shadow<00:03:29.680> down<00:03:29.980> so<00:03:30.760> you're<00:03:30.910> getting

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
bring the shadow down so you're getting

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.710 
bring the shadow down so you're getting
kind<00:03:31.330> of<00:03:31.360> a<00:03:31.510> fade<00:03:32.050> down<00:03:32.410> effect<00:03:33.690> without<00:03:34.690> a

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
kind of a fade down effect without a

it really

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.910 
it really
smoldering<00:03:46.780> at<00:03:47.020> the<00:03:47.080> lash<00:03:47.230> line<00:03:47.260> and<00:03:47.620> then<00:03:47.740> in

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
smoldering at the lash line and then in

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.830 
smoldering at the lash line and then in
the<00:03:48.040> eraser<00:03:48.250> on<00:03:48.610> the<00:03:48.700> other<00:03:48.820> side<00:03:49.090> to<00:03:49.570> kind<00:03:49.780> of

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
the eraser on the other side to kind of

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.050 
the eraser on the other side to kind of
clean<00:03:50.050> up<00:03:50.080> edges<00:03:50.590> and<00:03:50.830> smudges<00:03:51.190> down<00:03:51.430> I<00:03:51.730> think

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
clean up edges and smudges down I think

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.970 
clean up edges and smudges down I think
the<00:03:52.150> insider<00:03:52.540> trick<00:03:52.870> though<00:03:53.080> is<00:03:53.380> to<00:03:53.650> take<00:03:53.830> the

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
the insider trick though is to take the

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.800 
the insider trick though is to take the
product<00:03:54.370> and<00:03:54.610> to<00:03:55.090> do<00:03:55.239> your<00:03:55.390> little<00:03:55.540> cross

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
product and to do your little cross

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.720 
product and to do your little cross
hatching<00:03:56.230> motion

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
hatching motion

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.190 
hatching motion
so<00:03:57.940> that's<00:03:58.150> dragging<00:03:58.420> it<00:03:58.629> down<00:03:58.660> and<00:03:59.110> doing

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
so that's dragging it down and doing

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.869 
so that's dragging it down and doing
almost<00:03:59.620> like<00:03:59.709> little<00:03:59.920> hexes<00:04:00.400> one<00:04:00.700> thing

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 
almost like little hexes one thing

base of the lash where the mascara needs
to<00:05:31.720> be<00:05:31.810> deposited<00:05:32.110> because<00:05:33.039> that's<00:05:33.280> what

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
to be deposited because that's what

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.700

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.800 
keeps the lift in the lash if you coat
up<00:05:35.860> the<00:05:36.010> ends<00:05:36.220> of<00:05:36.370> lashes<00:05:36.880> too<00:05:37.120> much<00:05:37.360> it<00:05:37.570> weighs
