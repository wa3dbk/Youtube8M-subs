not a white brick now it's a

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.260 
not a white brick now it's a
rechargeable<00:00:16.730> battery

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.270 
rechargeable battery

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.980 
rechargeable battery
it's<00:00:18.170> called<00:00:18.670> pebble<00:00:19.670> juice<00:00:19.940> it's<00:00:20.599> made<00:00:20.840> by

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
it's called pebble juice it's made by

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.550 
it's called pebble juice it's made by
Samuel<00:00:21.500> and<00:00:21.789> what<00:00:22.789> it<00:00:22.910> does<00:00:23.119> is<00:00:23.449> it<00:00:24.080> lets<00:00:24.380> you

units<00:00:29.029> and<00:00:30.970> it<00:00:31.970> all<00:00:32.240> it<00:00:32.390> takes<00:00:32.630> about<00:00:32.780> three

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
units and it all it takes about three

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.990 
units and it all it takes about three
and<00:00:33.170> a<00:00:33.230> half<00:00:33.380> hours<00:00:33.770> for<00:00:33.980> this<00:00:34.160> battery<00:00:34.850> to

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
and a half hours for this battery to

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000 
and a half hours for this battery to
charge<00:00:35.030> and<00:00:35.600> then<00:00:36.469> you<00:00:37.039> just<00:00:37.309> turn<00:00:37.879> it<00:00:38.030> on<00:00:38.180> and

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
charge and then you just turn it on and

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.560 
charge and then you just turn it on and
you<00:00:40.010> can<00:00:40.039> power<00:00:40.370> two<00:00:40.610> pedals<00:00:40.910> now<00:00:41.239> I<00:00:41.270> found

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
you can power two pedals now I found

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.209 
you can power two pedals now I found
that<00:00:41.719> this<00:00:41.930> is<00:00:41.989> very<00:00:42.410> handy<00:00:42.829> sometimes

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
that this is very handy sometimes

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:46.090 
that this is very handy sometimes
because<00:00:43.550> I<00:00:43.789> am<00:00:44.570> even<00:00:45.469> though<00:00:45.500> I<00:00:45.559> have<00:00:45.800> a<00:00:45.829> lot<00:00:46.070> of

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
because I am even though I have a lot of

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.010 
because I am even though I have a lot of
gear<00:00:46.760> and<00:00:46.969> a<00:00:47.030> lot<00:00:47.180> of<00:00:47.300> pedals<00:00:47.600> and<00:00:47.750> so<00:00:47.899> on

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
gear and a lot of pedals and so on

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.760 
gear and a lot of pedals and so on
sometimes<00:00:48.199> I<00:00:48.710> like<00:00:49.100> to<00:00:49.129> just<00:00:49.520> go<00:00:50.030> to<00:00:50.059> a<00:00:50.270> jam

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770 
sometimes I like to just go to a jam

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.770 
sometimes I like to just go to a jam
bringing<00:00:51.770> one<00:00:52.010> pedal<00:00:52.399> or<00:00:52.609> perhaps<00:00:53.149> two<00:00:53.480> and

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
bringing one pedal or perhaps two and

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.900 
bringing one pedal or perhaps two and
instead<00:00:54.140> of<00:00:54.230> hauling<00:00:54.800> my<00:00:54.949> my<00:00:55.550> pedal<00:00:55.879> board

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
instead of hauling my my pedal board

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.170 
instead of hauling my my pedal board
around<00:00:56.420> and<00:00:56.719> not<00:00:57.649> knowing<00:00:57.949> perhaps<00:00:58.370> what<00:00:58.670> was

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
around and not knowing perhaps what was

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.849 
around and not knowing perhaps what was
power<00:00:59.449> will<00:01:00.019> be<00:01:00.140> available<00:01:00.649> where<00:01:00.769> I'm

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
power will be available where I'm

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:03.400 
power will be available where I'm
playing<00:01:01.129> I<00:01:01.430> just<00:01:01.850> bring<00:01:02.269> this<00:01:02.390> guy<00:01:02.600> and<00:01:03.320> I'm

playing I just bring this guy and I'm
gonna<00:01:03.469> have<00:01:03.620> to<00:01:03.649> worry<00:01:03.800> about<00:01:03.890> batteries

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
gonna have to worry about batteries

running<00:01:05.390> out<00:01:05.570> of<00:01:05.660> my<00:01:05.870> pedals<00:01:06.200> so<00:01:06.950> it's<00:01:07.070> really

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
running out of my pedals so it's really

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.429 
running out of my pedals so it's really
simple<00:01:07.490> you<00:01:07.790> just<00:01:07.940> take<00:01:10.180> take<00:01:11.180> the<00:01:11.390> cord<00:01:11.689> to

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
simple you just take take the cord to

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:15.310 
simple you just take take the cord to
plug<00:01:12.590> in<00:01:12.890> in<00:01:13.460> the<00:01:13.610> pedal<00:01:13.820> juice<00:01:14.030> and<00:01:14.420> on<00:01:15.200> the

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
plug in in the pedal juice and on the

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.490 
plug in in the pedal juice and on the
other<00:01:15.380> side<00:01:15.500> you<00:01:15.950> plug<00:01:16.159> into<00:01:16.340> your<00:01:16.490> pedal<00:01:17.500> here

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
other side you plug into your pedal here

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.969 
other side you plug into your pedal here
I<00:01:18.530> have<00:01:18.860> a<00:01:20.409> maxim<00:01:21.409> SD<00:01:21.920> 9<00:01:23.049> my<00:01:24.049> favorite<00:01:24.710> or

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
I have a maxim SD 9 my favorite or

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.060 
I have a maxim SD 9 my favorite or
distortion<00:01:25.850> and<00:01:25.939> overdrive<00:01:25.970> kind<00:01:26.540> of<00:01:26.600> pedal

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
distortion and overdrive kind of pedal

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.999 
distortion and overdrive kind of pedal
so<00:01:28.070> that's<00:01:29.030> all<00:01:29.360> you<00:01:29.540> need<00:01:29.659> to<00:01:29.780> do<00:01:29.930> you<00:01:30.770> turn<00:01:30.979> it

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
so that's all you need to do you turn it

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.840 
so that's all you need to do you turn it
on<00:01:31.159> here<00:01:31.430> and<00:01:32.409> the<00:01:33.409> light<00:01:33.619> goes<00:01:34.009> green<00:01:34.040> on<00:01:34.700> the

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
on here and the light goes green on the

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.899 
on here and the light goes green on the
pedal<00:01:35.060> juice<00:01:35.240> and<00:01:35.479> you're<00:01:36.350> good<00:01:36.530> to<00:01:36.649> go<00:01:36.909> you

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
pedal juice and you're good to go you

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:39.580 
pedal juice and you're good to go you
can<00:01:38.090> of<00:01:38.240> course<00:01:38.270> hook<00:01:38.659> up<00:01:38.840> the<00:01:38.990> second<00:01:39.409> pedal

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
can of course hook up the second pedal

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.630 
can of course hook up the second pedal
as<00:01:39.799> well<00:01:40.070> and<00:01:41.380> that's<00:01:42.380> how<00:01:43.009> many<00:01:43.189> outputs<00:01:43.340> you

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
as well and that's how many outputs you

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.520 
as well and that's how many outputs you
have<00:01:43.790> two<00:01:44.170> for<00:01:45.170> two<00:01:45.290> pedals<00:01:45.790> so<00:01:47.079> it's<00:01:48.079> a<00:01:48.259> nine

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
have two for two pedals so it's a nine

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.679 
have two for two pedals so it's a nine
volts<00:01:49.009> output<00:01:49.210> battery<00:01:50.210> and<00:01:52.450> another<00:01:53.450> cool

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
volts output battery and another cool

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:55.780 
volts output battery and another cool
feature<00:01:53.930> is<00:01:54.229> that<00:01:54.259> when<00:01:54.890> the<00:01:55.189> battery<00:01:55.490> starts

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
feature is that when the battery starts

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.020 
feature is that when the battery starts
to<00:01:55.969> go<00:01:56.119> a<00:01:56.149> week<00:01:56.450> it<00:01:57.320> turns<00:01:57.649> orange<00:01:57.979> means<00:01:58.820> that

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
to go a week it turns orange means that

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.359 
to go a week it turns orange means that
it's<00:01:59.200> it's<00:02:00.200> getting<00:02:00.409> a<00:02:00.590> little<00:02:00.680> bit<00:02:00.829> low<00:02:01.039> and

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
it's it's getting a little bit low and

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.690 
it's it's getting a little bit low and
when<00:02:01.789> it<00:02:01.909> starts<00:02:02.229> turning<00:02:03.229> red<00:02:03.619> then<00:02:04.460> you're

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
when it starts turning red then you're

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.210 
when it starts turning red then you're
close<00:02:05.000> to<00:02:05.320> to<00:02:06.320> needing<00:02:06.649> to<00:02:06.799> recharge<00:02:07.189> it<00:02:08.170> so

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
close to to needing to recharge it so

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.710 
close to to needing to recharge it so
let's<00:02:10.220> take<00:02:10.430> a<00:02:10.460> closer<00:02:10.789> look<00:02:11.000> at<00:02:11.390> it<00:02:11.540> up<00:02:11.690> close

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
let's take a closer look at it up close

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.460 
let's take a closer look at it up close
you<00:02:12.170> can<00:02:12.230> see<00:02:12.560> better<00:02:12.740> so<00:02:14.080> right<00:02:15.080> here<00:02:15.350> is

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
you can see better so right here is

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.680 
you can see better so right here is
where<00:02:15.500> you<00:02:15.830> plug<00:02:16.130> in<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.520> adapter<00:02:16.580> to

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
where you plug in the adapter to

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.170 
where you plug in the adapter to
charge<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:18.110> battery<00:02:18.350> and<00:02:18.610> here<00:02:19.610> you<00:02:19.730> have<00:02:19.940> the

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
problem the only thing I would have

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.990 
problem the only thing I would have
missed<00:03:38.800> would<00:03:39.800> be<00:03:39.920> a<00:03:39.950> black<00:03:40.250> version<00:03:40.700> but<00:03:40.880> the

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
missed would be a black version but the

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.270 
missed would be a black version but the
thing<00:03:41.180> is<00:03:41.209> they<00:03:41.540> have<00:03:41.810> just<00:03:42.170> come<00:03:42.709> out<00:03:42.739> with<00:03:43.160> a

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
thing is they have just come out with a

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.040 
thing is they have just come out with a
black<00:03:43.520> version<00:03:44.060> of<00:03:44.330> the<00:03:44.390> middle<00:03:44.600> juice<00:03:44.780> and

that's the one I would recommend you get

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.140
