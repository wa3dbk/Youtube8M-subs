00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
the game is about to end 198 we're

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.150 
the game is about to end 198 we're
losing<00:02:33.380> and<00:02:35.110> then<00:02:36.110> i<00:02:36.140> call<00:02:36.440> him<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.590> chopper

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
losing and then i call him the chopper

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.640 
losing and then i call him the chopper
and<00:02:38.150> I<00:02:38.420> pretty<00:02:38.690> much<00:02:38.780> realized<00:02:39.290> all<00:02:39.530> right

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
and I pretty much realized all right

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.620 
and I pretty much realized all right
let's<00:02:39.890> just<00:02:40.130> try<00:02:40.310> to<00:02:40.370> rate<00:02:40.610> this<00:02:40.790> a<00:02:41.060> good

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
let's just try to rate this a good

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.479 
let's just try to rate this a good
chopper<00:02:41.930> i<00:02:42.200> know<00:02:42.260> i'm<00:02:42.440> not<00:02:42.590> going<00:02:42.800> to<00:02:42.890> nuke<00:02:43.160> but

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
chopper i know i'm not going to nuke but

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.150 
chopper i know i'm not going to nuke but
then<00:02:44.120> I<00:02:44.239> realize<00:02:44.570> that<00:02:44.600> we're<00:02:45.170> dominated<00:02:45.830> for

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
then I realize that we're dominated for

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.420 
then I realize that we're dominated for
dominating<00:02:46.790> and<00:02:47.540> that<00:02:48.230> they're<00:02:49.010> not<00:02:49.190> getting

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
dominating and that they're not getting

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.300 
dominating and that they're not getting
any<00:02:49.610> points<00:02:50.150> so<00:02:50.570> that<00:02:50.600> is<00:02:51.050> a<00:02:51.110> legit<00:02:51.739> chance<00:02:51.980> I

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
any points so that is a legit chance I

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.600 
any points so that is a legit chance I
can<00:02:52.430> get<00:02:52.519> a<00:02:52.580> new<00:02:52.750> so<00:02:53.750> I<00:02:53.780> basically<00:02:54.440> do<00:02:54.830> I<00:02:55.130> try<00:02:55.580> to

didn't know what time that even if

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.150 
didn't know what time that even if
you're<00:03:04.880> not<00:03:05.090> that<00:03:05.510> if<00:03:05.989> you're<00:03:06.170> dominating<00:03:06.380> the

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
you're not that if you're dominating the

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.090 
you're not that if you're dominating the
other<00:03:07.370> team<00:03:07.580> doesn't<00:03:07.760> get<00:03:07.910> points<00:03:08.380> but<00:03:09.380> uh<00:03:09.410> so
