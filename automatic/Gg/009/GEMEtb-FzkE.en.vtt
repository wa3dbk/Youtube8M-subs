00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
stitches you have on your needles before

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:19.620 
stitches you have on your needles before
you<00:03:18.190> begin<00:03:18.430> making<00:03:18.700> your<00:03:18.849> bobbles<00:03:19.329> and<00:03:19.480> then

after you're done making a bubble I

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.339 
after you're done making a bubble I
would<00:03:21.370> count<00:03:21.610> the<00:03:21.700> stitches<00:03:21.940> again<00:03:22.349> because

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
would count the stitches again because

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:25.710 
would count the stitches again because
as<00:03:23.470> you<00:03:23.620> can<00:03:23.769> tell<00:03:24.010> you<00:03:24.519> know<00:03:24.609> we<00:03:24.730> added<00:03:24.910> two

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
as you can tell you know we added two

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.780 
as you can tell you know we added two
stitches<00:03:26.230> and<00:03:26.410> then<00:03:27.100> we<00:03:27.220> had<00:03:27.370> to<00:03:27.459> take<00:03:27.639> those

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
stitches and then we had to take those

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.090 
stitches and then we had to take those
two<00:03:28.000> stitches<00:03:28.209> away<00:03:28.569> so<00:03:29.260> if<00:03:29.620> you're<00:03:29.980> not

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
two stitches away so if you're not

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.090 
two stitches away so if you're not
counting<00:03:30.430> you<00:03:31.090> could<00:03:31.480> end<00:03:31.870> up<00:03:32.230> taking<00:03:32.739> more

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
counting you could end up taking more

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.340 
counting you could end up taking more
away<00:03:33.310> than<00:03:33.519> you're<00:03:33.639> supposed<00:03:34.000> to<00:03:34.150> or<00:03:34.660> adding

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
away than you're supposed to or adding

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.509 
away than you're supposed to or adding
stitches<00:03:35.530> and<00:03:35.829> then<00:03:35.889> you've<00:03:36.040> got<00:03:36.160> a<00:03:36.190> big<00:03:36.340> mess

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
stitches and then you've got a big mess

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.099 
stitches and then you've got a big mess
so<00:03:36.760> if<00:03:36.880> you're<00:03:37.000> new<00:03:37.180> just<00:03:37.480> cut<00:03:37.660> your<00:03:37.750> stitches

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
so if you're new just cut your stitches

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:40.890 
so if you're new just cut your stitches
and<00:03:38.290> only<00:03:38.410> takes<00:03:38.620> a<00:03:38.709> few<00:03:38.739> seconds<00:03:39.250> and<00:03:39.810> so<00:03:40.810> you

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
and only takes a few seconds and so you

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.000 
and only takes a few seconds and so you
can<00:03:41.019> get<00:03:41.109> it<00:03:41.200> right<00:03:41.350> but<00:03:41.590> that's<00:03:41.709> a<00:03:41.859> really

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
can get it right but that's a really

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.289 
can get it right but that's a really
cute<00:03:42.220> bobble<00:03:42.549> I'm<00:03:42.609> going<00:03:42.760> to<00:03:42.819> keep<00:03:42.940> that<00:03:43.060> in<00:03:43.180> my
