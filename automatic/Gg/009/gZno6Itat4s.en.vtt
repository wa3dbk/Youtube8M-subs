bit wary that something like Bhopal
could<00:02:17.470> have<00:02:17.560> happened<00:02:17.920> where<00:02:18.010> hundreds<00:02:18.400> and

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
could have happened where hundreds and

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.920 
could have happened where hundreds and

thousands of Indian lives were affected
yet<00:02:20.920> there<00:02:21.130> are<00:02:21.220> still<00:02:21.280> so<00:02:22.000> many<00:02:22.060> places<00:02:22.630> here

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
yet there are still so many places here

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.830 
yet there are still so many places here
in<00:02:23.290> India<00:02:23.590> whether<00:02:23.830> its<00:02:24.070> nuclear<00:02:24.610> plants<00:02:25.360> that

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
in India whether its nuclear plants that

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.810 
in India whether its nuclear plants that
are<00:02:25.870> also<00:02:26.260> still<00:02:26.770> run<00:02:27.070> by<00:02:27.280> American<00:02:27.790> companies

believed was their responsibility the
Bhopal<00:02:35.890> gas<00:02:36.400> accident<00:02:37.390> back<00:02:37.540> in<00:02:37.570> nineteen

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
Bhopal gas accident back in nineteen

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.570 
Bhopal gas accident back in nineteen
eighty-four<00:02:38.170> something<00:02:39.130> like<00:02:39.280> that<00:02:39.310> could

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
eighty-four something like that could

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.650 
eighty-four something like that could
happen<00:02:39.640> again<00:02:39.970> and<00:02:40.210> they<00:02:40.870> don't<00:02:40.990> want<00:02:41.260> another
