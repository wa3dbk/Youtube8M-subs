now I'm going to show you how to DB r
clean<00:00:06.330> and<00:00:06.690> store<00:00:07.049> muscles<00:00:07.770> so<00:00:08.189> first<00:00:08.610> I

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
clean and store muscles so first I

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.310 
clean and store muscles so first I
thought<00:00:08.880> it<00:00:09.059> might<00:00:09.150> be<00:00:09.450> educational<00:00:10.050> to<00:00:10.139> show

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
thought it might be educational to show

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.860 
thought it might be educational to show
you<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:10.860> live<00:00:11.639> muscle<00:00:11.969> versus<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.420> dead<00:00:12.660> muscle

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
you a live muscle versus a dead muscle

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.589 
you a live muscle versus a dead muscle
so<00:00:13.200> you<00:00:13.259> know<00:00:13.410> what<00:00:13.559> you're<00:00:13.679> looking<00:00:13.769> for

so you know what you're looking for

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.359 
so you know what you're looking for
exhibit<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.750> here<00:00:16.109> is<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.379> totally<00:00:17.039> dead<00:00:17.250> muscle

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
exhibit a here is a totally dead muscle

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.370 
exhibit a here is a totally dead muscle
Exhibit<00:00:20.369> B<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.390> live<00:00:21.689> muscle<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.289> way

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
Exhibit B is a live muscle and the way

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.779 
Exhibit B is a live muscle and the way
that<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:22.619> know<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.830> difference<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.369> if<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.580> touch

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
that I know the difference is if I touch

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.210 
that I know the difference is if I touch
this<00:00:24.180> one<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.689> grab<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.380> it's<00:00:25.800> going<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:25.980> start

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
this one and grab it it's going to start

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.939 
this one and grab it it's going to start
to<00:00:26.310> close<00:00:27.199> sometimes<00:00:28.199> you<00:00:28.320> can<00:00:28.470> knock<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.680> a

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
to close sometimes you can knock it a

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.310 
to close sometimes you can knock it a
little<00:00:29.099> bit<00:00:29.310> but<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:30.390> see<00:00:30.510> how<00:00:30.599> closed<00:00:31.019> right

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
little bit but you see how closed right

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.880 
little bit but you see how closed right

to do right now is how daddy beard a
muscle<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.100> beard<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:05.519> this<00:01:05.729> part<00:01:06.270> of

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
muscle and the beard is this part of

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.870 
muscle and the beard is this part of
filaments<00:01:07.110> like<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.260> filament<00:01:07.890> here<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.760> where

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
filaments like a filament here is where

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.219 
filaments like a filament here is where
you<00:01:08.909> go<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.119> go<00:01:09.330> fishing<00:01:09.600> with<00:01:09.900> this<00:01:10.020> stuff

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
you go you go fishing with this stuff

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.080 
you go you go fishing with this stuff
it's<00:01:10.409> so<00:01:10.470> strong<00:01:10.950> it's<00:01:11.460> basically<00:01:11.790> what<00:01:12.000> the

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
it's so strong it's basically what the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.289 
it's so strong it's basically what the
muscle<00:01:12.420> creates<00:01:12.810> in<00:01:12.990> order<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.380> catch<00:01:13.710> on<00:01:14.040> to

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
muscle creates in order to catch on to

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.990 
muscle creates in order to catch on to
rocks<00:01:15.299> or<00:01:15.860> rope<00:01:16.860> or<00:01:17.220> whatever<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.850> the

rocks or rope or whatever it is that the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.700 
rocks or rope or whatever it is that the
the<00:01:18.270> muscle<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.720> going<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.930> attach<00:01:19.200> on<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.619> to

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
the muscle is going to attach on to to

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.730 
the muscle is going to attach on to to
filter<00:01:20.070> feed<00:01:20.280> this<00:01:21.119> part<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:22.020> attached<00:01:22.409> inside

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
filter feed this part is attached inside

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.010 
filter feed this part is attached inside
the<00:01:23.250> muscle<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:24.630> don't<00:01:24.810> want<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:24.990> eat

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
the muscle and you don't want to eat

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.840 
the muscle and you don't want to eat
this<00:01:25.170> it's<00:01:25.380> really<00:01:25.740> tough<00:01:25.950> like<00:01:26.189> like<00:01:26.549> string

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
this it's really tough like like string

they don't have enough oxygen that way

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.500 
they don't have enough oxygen that way
and<00:02:50.770> they<00:02:51.100> they<00:02:51.400> die<00:02:51.580> that<00:02:51.820> way<00:02:51.970> so<00:02:52.030> you<00:02:52.270> want

it if you want to store ice on them put

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.250 
it if you want to store ice on them put
the<00:02:54.340> ice<00:02:54.459> in<00:02:54.490> a<00:02:54.730> bag<00:02:54.910> put<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:55.480> bag<00:02:55.630> on<00:02:55.780> top<00:02:55.990> and

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
on top so that the ice can drip through

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.670 
on top so that the ice can drip through
okay<00:03:03.850> but<00:03:03.940> really<00:03:04.300> you<00:03:04.420> don't<00:03:04.600> really<00:03:05.380> need<00:03:05.560> to
