00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:07.580
 maybe these days you are images 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.580
 be the most repetitive in the country 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.540
 the recovery throughout the east of 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.000
 cuba is evident and in santiago 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.650
 intensify the work of sanitation 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.480
 because Hurricane Sandy left more than 7 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.790
 millions of cubic meters of rubble 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.210
 and scattered trees all over the 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.460
 city 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.349
 the jumpers that dawned before 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.290
 near the cane fields now invade 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:30.390
 the city spaces more than 360 thousand 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.510
 cubic meters of waste carry in 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.070
 these trucks the path of his burial 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.290
 the main arteries begin to see 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.390
 the usual traffic people still 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.370
 without recovering the astonishment bending in 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.730
 each work center or on its own 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.980
 home 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.020
 what was born this town founded by 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.400
 Spanish in Cuba looks older 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.820
 although today's wrinkles carry the 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.660
 marks of the wind and the enraged sea 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.760
 It happened like that at the airport 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.250
 international antonio maceo and in all 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.870
 its surroundings this road that always 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.240
 welcomed today only transmits the 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.370
 helplessness without truce the light to all 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:06.619
 shadow all the salons lost the 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.619
 false ceiling crystals and lamps 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.250
 and that's how the lobby that dismissed 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.990
 so many passengers here does not exist anymore 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.460
 no division between the salons of 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.890
 Arrival and departure of flights 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.200
 the hangar where they were repaired 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.080
 aircraft and the control tower were 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.630
 dismantled as you can see disrupted 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.000
 he even took the protection and 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.890
 I destroy all the panels that are 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.630
 positions in fundamental technology 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.000
 for the operation of the tower as 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.130
 so and then he really took it 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.170
 with the control tower that look how 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.000
 it's been nobody would have imagined that 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.550
 the extraordinary fury of the winds of 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.660

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.350
 only the structure of 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.140
 concrete the bust to the bronze titan and 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.690
 his name and his image expectant today of 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.700
 the recuperative stage nobody thinks today 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.700
 in a nap the disaster merits 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.630
 cleaning repair and organization all 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.430
