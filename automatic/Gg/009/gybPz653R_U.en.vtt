00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
the dashboard and as you already know

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.060 
the dashboard and as you already know
that's<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.660> gearshift<00:00:58.230> but<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.800> cool<00:00:59.039> thing

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
that's the gearshift but the cool thing

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.639 
that's the gearshift but the cool thing
about<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.609> gear<00:00:59.820> shift<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.300> in<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:00.780> car<00:01:01.109> it's

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
about the gear shift is in this car it's

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.860 
about the gear shift is in this car it's
moved<00:01:02.039> up<00:01:02.309> more<00:01:02.609> towards<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.149> steering<00:01:03.690> wheel

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
moved up more towards the steering wheel

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.039 
moved up more towards the steering wheel
now<00:01:04.589> in<00:01:04.860> most<00:01:05.070> cars<00:01:05.430> usually<00:01:05.820> from<00:01:06.689> what<00:01:06.900> I've

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
now in most cars usually from what I've

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.200 
now in most cars usually from what I've
seen<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:08.010> gear<00:01:08.250> shift<00:01:08.549> will<00:01:08.700> be<00:01:08.729> in<00:01:09.030> between

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
seen the gear shift will be in between

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.149 
seen the gear shift will be in between
the<00:01:09.510> driver's<00:01:09.930> seat<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.439> passenger<00:01:10.950> seat

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
the driver's seat and the passenger seat

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.399 
the driver's seat and the passenger seat
right<00:01:11.970> in<00:01:12.000> between<00:01:12.210> right<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:12.869> area<00:01:13.080> but

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
right in between right in this area but

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.789 
right in between right in this area but
these<00:01:13.530> are<00:01:13.680> cupholders<00:01:14.310> now<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:15.560> this<00:01:16.560> makes

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
these are cupholders now so this makes

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.679 
these are cupholders now so this makes
it<00:01:16.950> easier<00:01:17.340> for<00:01:17.580> me<00:01:17.700> because<00:01:17.729> it's<00:01:18.360> literally

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
it easier for me because it's literally

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.149 
it easier for me because it's literally
like<00:01:18.930> right<00:01:18.990> next<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.650> steering<00:01:19.890> wheel

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
like right next to the steering wheel

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.980 
like right next to the steering wheel
they're<00:01:20.939> like<00:01:21.060> little<00:01:21.180> next-door<00:01:21.659> neighbors

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
they're like little next-door neighbors

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.929 
they're like little next-door neighbors
there<00:01:22.229> so<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:23.220> know<00:01:23.340> it's<00:01:23.580> not<00:01:23.729> that

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
there so you know it's not that

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.609 
there so you know it's not that
complicated<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.659> really<00:01:24.840> like<00:01:25.020> reach<00:01:25.350> for

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
complicated to really like reach for

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.609 
complicated to really like reach for
downward<00:01:25.890> in<00:01:26.310> some<00:01:26.580> ways<00:01:26.790> but<00:01:27.780> um<00:01:28.020> what<00:01:28.560> I

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
downward in some ways but um what I

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.200 
downward in some ways but um what I
really<00:01:28.890> like<00:01:29.040> about<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.340> steering<00:01:29.820> wheel<00:01:29.970> is

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
really like about the steering wheel is

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.050 
really like about the steering wheel is
that<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:30.900> have<00:01:31.049> your<00:01:31.170> volume<00:01:31.320> control<00:01:32.060> power

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
that you have your volume control power

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.960 
that you have your volume control power
control<00:01:33.509> over<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.900> FM<00:01:34.259> AM<00:01:34.500> radio<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.310> of

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
control over the FM AM radio and of

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.870 
control over the FM AM radio and of
course<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.270> got<00:01:36.479> cruise<00:01:36.720> control<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.880> which

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
course you got cruise control and which

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.249 
course you got cruise control and which
I<00:01:39.030> probably<00:01:39.210> won't<00:01:39.420> be<00:01:39.570> using<00:01:39.750> unless<00:01:40.079> of

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
I probably won't be using unless of

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.810 
I probably won't be using unless of
course<00:01:40.290> I'm<00:01:40.680> driving<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.220> Florida<00:01:41.670> and

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
course I'm driving the Florida and

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.969 
course I'm driving the Florida and
staying<00:01:42.150> on<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.479> 98<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.439> believe<00:01:43.710> that's<00:01:43.890> what

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
staying on the 98 I believe that's what

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.830 
staying on the 98 I believe that's what
it's<00:01:44.100> called<00:01:44.280> so<00:01:45.180> that's<00:01:45.420> if<00:01:45.570> you're<00:01:45.659> going<00:01:45.780> to

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
it's called so that's if you're going to

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.450 
it's called so that's if you're going to
be<00:01:45.930> staying<00:01:46.140> on<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.350> highway<00:01:46.799> for<00:01:46.829> quite<00:01:47.220> some

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
be staying on a highway for quite some

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.460 
be staying on a highway for quite some
time<00:01:47.490> that's<00:01:47.970> when<00:01:48.210> you'll<00:01:48.360> use<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.570> cruise
