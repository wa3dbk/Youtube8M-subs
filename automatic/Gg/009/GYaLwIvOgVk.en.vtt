00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.039 
it in and each spider has and this is
this<00:01:38.549> is<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.820> little<00:01:39.210> bit<00:01:39.360> long<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:39.570> we'll<00:01:39.869> just

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
this is a little bit long so we'll just

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.690 
this is a little bit long so we'll just
turn<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.290> like<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.100> put<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:41.490> there

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
turn that like that and put it in there

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.569 
turn that like that and put it in there
so<00:01:42.390> each<00:01:42.630> one<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.049> spiders<00:01:43.470> has<00:01:43.710> four<00:01:44.070> legs

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
so each one of the spiders has four legs

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.690 
so each one of the spiders has four legs
on<00:01:45.090> each<00:01:45.390> side<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.170> then<00:01:46.409> eminem's<00:01:46.950> for<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.250> and

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
on each side and then eminem's for I and

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.410 
on each side and then eminem's for I and
so<00:01:47.909> then<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.240> take<00:01:48.540> those<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.229> put<00:01:49.470> those<00:01:49.710> all
