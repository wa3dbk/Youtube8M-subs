been in previous games through the
addition<00:03:52.860> of<00:03:52.920> firing<00:03:53.400> lines

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
addition of firing lines

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.670 
addition of firing lines
so<00:03:53.970> firing<00:03:54.660> lines<00:03:54.840> are<00:03:55.020> a<00:03:55.050> key<00:03:55.170> feature<00:03:55.410> of<00:03:55.560> the

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
period and we've integrated them into

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.060

archetypes in the game to make sure that

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.050 
archetypes in the game to make sure that

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
you have to change your strategy

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.270 
you have to change your strategy

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
just like our navigation we're tried

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.470 
just like our navigation we're tried
very<00:04:40.010> hard<00:04:40.070> to<00:04:40.340> make<00:04:40.550> it<00:04:40.700> believable<00:04:40.880> and

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
very hard to make it believable and

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
the new assassin can also assassinate

weapons<00:04:51.050> in<00:04:51.379> this<00:04:51.469> case<00:04:51.680> we'll<00:04:51.860> use<00:04:51.889> the<00:04:52.069> Tom

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
weapons in this case we'll use the Tom

very hard to keep natural shapes organic

very hard to keep natural shapes organic

services to make believable terrain here

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.550 
services to make believable terrain here
you'll<00:05:17.150> see<00:05:17.360> that<00:05:17.509> the<00:05:17.659> environment<00:05:18.259> self<00:05:18.439> is

you'll see that the environment self is

you'll see that the environment self is
not<00:05:18.710> greeted<00:05:19.129> that<00:05:19.639> our<00:05:19.849> Conor<00:05:20.150> is<00:05:20.270> able<00:05:20.509> to

00:05:20.619 --> 00:05:20.629 
not greeted that our Conor is able to

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:22.269 
not greeted that our Conor is able to
grab<00:05:20.900> on<00:05:21.110> to<00:05:21.259> all<00:05:21.560> kinds<00:05:21.860> of<00:05:21.919> different<00:05:22.129> shapes

00:05:22.269 --> 00:05:22.279 
grab on to all kinds of different shapes

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:24.159 
grab on to all kinds of different shapes
which<00:05:23.210> we<00:05:23.330> think<00:05:23.479> is<00:05:23.599> particularly<00:05:23.930> special

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
which we think is particularly special

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:33.130 
which we think is particularly special
in<00:05:24.860> an<00:05:25.009> open<00:05:25.250> world<00:05:25.370> context

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.140 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.390 

this<00:05:34.140> is<00:05:34.230> one<00:05:34.350> of<00:05:34.380> three<00:05:34.620> ways<00:05:34.950> into<00:05:35.280> this

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
this is one of three ways into this

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.040 
this is one of three ways into this
particular<00:05:35.700> fort<00:05:36.150> it's<00:05:36.330> sort<00:05:36.540> of<00:05:36.570> the<00:05:36.720> stealth

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
particular fort it's sort of the stealth

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:58.460 
particular fort it's sort of the stealth
path<00:05:37.830> at<00:05:38.160> the<00:05:38.310> rear

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.470 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.600 

so<00:05:59.470> black<00:05:59.650> powder<00:05:59.920> is<00:06:00.100> not<00:06:00.130> just<00:06:00.370> a<00:06:00.430> key

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
so black powder is not just a key

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.280 
so black powder is not just a key
historical<00:06:01.240> resource<00:06:01.660> you<00:06:01.840> can<00:06:01.870> see<00:06:02.080> it<00:06:02.139> being

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:02.290 
historical resource you can see it being

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:06.629 
historical resource you can see it being
loaded<00:06:02.530> there<00:06:03.210> into<00:06:04.210> that<00:06:04.240> cabin<00:06:05.430> but<00:06:06.430> it<00:06:06.490> also

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:06.639 
loaded there into that cabin but it also

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:08.760 
loaded there into that cabin but it also
gave<00:06:06.820> us<00:06:06.880> an<00:06:07.030> opportunity<00:06:07.150> to<00:06:07.930> include<00:06:08.500> some

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 
gave us an opportunity to include some

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:18.600 
gave us an opportunity to include some
historical<00:06:09.280> exploding<00:06:10.240> barrels<00:06:17.370> so<00:06:18.370> nothing

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
historical exploding barrels so nothing

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:19.890 
historical exploding barrels so nothing
we<00:06:18.700> invested<00:06:19.030> heavily<00:06:19.180> in<00:06:19.360> is<00:06:19.540> this<00:06:19.660> notion

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:19.900 
we invested heavily in is this notion

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.680 
we invested heavily in is this notion
that<00:06:20.080> Connor<00:06:20.410> is<00:06:20.680> always<00:06:21.580> on<00:06:21.730> the<00:06:21.820> move<00:06:22.000> and<00:06:22.330> we

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.690 
that Connor is always on the move and we

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.990 
that Connor is always on the move and we
gave<00:06:22.780> him<00:06:22.840> a<00:06:22.930> bunch<00:06:23.110> of<00:06:23.230> new<00:06:23.500> abilities<00:06:24.400> such

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 
gave him a bunch of new abilities such

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.760 
gave him a bunch of new abilities such
as<00:06:25.120> running<00:06:25.360> assassinate<00:06:25.960> so<00:06:26.380> here's<00:06:26.650> he

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:26.770 
as running assassinate so here's he

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:28.409 
as running assassinate so here's he
chases<00:06:27.160> Silas<00:06:27.490> you<00:06:27.610> can<00:06:27.760> assassinate<00:06:28.300> this

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:28.419 
chases Silas you can assassinate this

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:30.180 
chases Silas you can assassinate this
guy<00:06:28.540> in<00:06:28.720> the<00:06:28.810> run<00:06:28.990> you<00:06:29.440> can<00:06:29.590> snatch<00:06:29.830> up<00:06:30.070> this

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:30.190 
guy in the run you can snatch up this

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.220 
guy in the run you can snatch up this
musket<00:06:30.580> on<00:06:30.730> the<00:06:30.820> run<00:06:30.970> kill<00:06:31.480> another<00:06:31.750> guy<00:06:31.960> and
