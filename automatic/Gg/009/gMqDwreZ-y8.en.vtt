plumbed into my ten gallon overflow
through<00:00:19.449> via<00:00:19.750> syphon<00:00:20.080> I<00:00:20.500> mean<00:00:21.310> him<00:00:21.519> drilled

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:21.849 
through via syphon I mean him drilled

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:24.179 
through via syphon I mean him drilled
this<00:00:22.060> glass<00:00:22.539> out<00:00:22.779> with<00:00:23.080> a<00:00:23.109> dremel<00:00:23.439> and<00:00:23.830> put<00:00:24.070> in

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:24.189 
this glass out with a dremel and put in

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:26.580 
this glass out with a dremel and put in
a<00:00:24.310> drain<00:00:24.609> and<00:00:25.510> I<00:00:25.570> just<00:00:25.810> put<00:00:25.960> my<00:00:25.990> electric

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
a drain and I just put my electric

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.080 
a drain and I just put my electric
scallop<00:00:26.980> in<00:00:27.160> there<00:00:27.340> and<00:00:27.490> my<00:00:27.580> man<00:00:27.789> Joe's

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090 
scallop in there and my man Joe's

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.040 
scallop in there and my man Joe's
figured<00:00:28.539> that<00:00:28.720> my<00:00:28.869> man<00:00:29.080> Joe's<00:00:29.289> can't<00:00:29.589> get

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
figured that my man Joe's can't get

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.750 
figured that my man Joe's can't get
possibly<00:00:32.050> maybe<00:00:32.259> they<00:00:32.739> can't<00:00:33.010> reproduce<00:00:33.370> with

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
possibly maybe they can't reproduce with

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.549 
possibly maybe they can't reproduce with
such<00:00:33.969> a<00:00:34.000> small<00:00:34.360> drain<00:00:34.629> I'm<00:00:34.840> not<00:00:34.989> sure<00:00:35.230> I<00:00:35.260> might

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
such a small drain I'm not sure I might

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:37.020 
such a small drain I'm not sure I might
be<00:00:35.710> putting<00:00:35.950> the<00:00:36.040> sponge<00:00:36.309> right<00:00:36.520> there<00:00:36.760> so

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
be putting the sponge right there so

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.260 
be putting the sponge right there so
they<00:00:37.180> can<00:00:37.899> just<00:00:38.110> fill<00:00:38.320> this<00:00:38.469> vase<00:00:38.710> up<00:00:39.010> but

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
they can just fill this vase up but

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.470 
they can just fill this vase up but
electric<00:00:40.270> scallop<00:00:41.700> this<00:00:42.700> is<00:00:42.850> a<00:00:42.879> good<00:00:43.149> spot<00:00:43.420> for

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
electric scallop this is a good spot for

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.170

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.510 
it I think these guys will do fine with
I<00:01:13.870> think<00:01:14.110> there's<00:01:14.350> about<00:01:14.410> 76<00:01:15.010> Watts<00:01:15.250> right

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
I think there's about 76 Watts right

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.340 
I think there's about 76 Watts right
here<00:01:15.820> I<00:01:16.060> don't<00:01:16.540> know<00:01:16.750> we're<00:01:16.930> about<00:01:17.020> nine

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
here I don't know we're about nine

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.830 
here I don't know we're about nine
inches<00:01:17.560> away<00:01:17.830> so<00:01:20.520> we<00:01:21.520> did<00:01:22.060> this<00:01:22.240> tank<00:01:22.570> a<00:01:22.720> little

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
inches away so we did this tank a little

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.830 
inches away so we did this tank a little
bit<00:01:23.140> we<00:01:23.350> got<00:01:23.380> a<00:01:23.940> blue<00:01:24.940> or<00:01:24.970> silver<00:01:25.420> blue

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
bit we got a blue or silver blue

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.900 
bit we got a blue or silver blue
pulsating<00:01:26.830> xenia<00:01:27.250> down<00:01:28.030> here<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:29.530> I<00:01:30.280> had<00:01:30.760> it

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
pulsating xenia down here and I had it

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.700 
pulsating xenia down here and I had it
inside<00:01:31.240> this<00:01:31.390> container<00:01:31.780> with<00:01:32.140> the<00:01:32.230> rock<00:01:32.440> and

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
inside this container with the rock and

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.890 
inside this container with the rock and
it<00:01:32.800> chose<00:01:32.980> to<00:01:33.040> stick<00:01:33.400> to<00:01:33.610> this<00:01:33.760> I<00:01:34.120> just<00:01:34.450> flipped

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
it chose to stick to this I just flipped

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.510 
it chose to stick to this I just flipped
the<00:01:34.990> container<00:01:35.350> off<00:01:35.590> to<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:35.890> lid<00:01:36.070> off<00:01:36.250> and

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
the container off to the lid off and

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.700 
the container off to the lid off and
then<00:01:36.640> hopefully<00:01:37.120> it's<00:01:37.630> migrating<00:01:38.260> its<00:01:38.380> way<00:01:38.560> up

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
then hopefully it's migrating its way up

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.620 
then hopefully it's migrating its way up
to<00:01:38.860> the<00:01:38.980> top<00:01:39.220> or<00:01:39.520> this<00:01:39.670> other<00:01:39.850> rock<00:01:40.120> is<00:01:40.390> so

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
to the top or this other rock is so

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.050 
to the top or this other rock is so
hopefully<00:01:40.990> it'll<00:01:41.140> attach<00:01:41.410> there<00:01:45.060> all-in-all

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
hopefully it'll attach there all-in-all

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.960 
hopefully it'll attach there all-in-all

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
issues with leaks with my protein

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.110 
issues with leaks with my protein
skimmer<00:02:14.110> not<00:02:14.380> sure<00:02:14.620> why

here but hasn't happened yet now I don't

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.180 
here but hasn't happened yet now I don't
know<00:02:27.160> why<00:02:27.450> it's<00:02:28.450> a<00:02:28.780> I<00:02:29.140> took<00:02:29.530> this<00:02:29.650> thing<00:02:29.709> apart

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
know why it's a I took this thing apart

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.390 
know why it's a I took this thing apart
put<00:02:30.489> it<00:02:30.580> back<00:02:30.730> on<00:02:30.940> here<00:02:31.180> about<00:02:31.300> three<00:02:31.690> times

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
put it back on here about three times

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.199 
put it back on here about three times
but<00:02:34.350> it<00:02:35.350> seems<00:02:36.069> to<00:02:36.220> be<00:02:36.340> working<00:02:36.459> now<00:02:36.819> it's<00:02:37.060> been

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
but it seems to be working now it's been

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.050 
but it seems to be working now it's been
about<00:02:37.360> 12<00:02:37.690> hours<00:02:37.930> no<00:02:38.470> leaks<00:02:38.819> notice<00:02:39.819> one<00:02:40.030> thing

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
about 12 hours no leaks notice one thing

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:46.320 
about 12 hours no leaks notice one thing
that's<00:02:40.930> one<00:02:41.260> night<00:02:41.500> is<00:02:41.680> skimming<00:02:42.540> so<00:02:45.330> that's

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
that's one night is skimming so that's

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.770 
that's one night is skimming so that's
definitely<00:02:47.610> doing<00:02:48.610> more<00:02:48.850> than<00:02:49.060> it<00:02:49.209> needs<00:02:49.450> to

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
definitely doing more than it needs to

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.710 
definitely doing more than it needs to
now<00:02:49.989> I<00:02:50.370> think<00:02:51.370> we<00:02:51.760> had<00:02:51.940> it<00:02:52.090> turned<00:02:52.299> out<00:02:52.450> too

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
now I think we had it turned out too

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.580 
now I think we had it turned out too
high<00:02:52.930> and<00:02:54.299> it<00:02:55.299> was<00:02:55.420> just<00:02:55.690> mainly<00:02:55.870> bringing

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
high and it was just mainly bringing

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.220 
high and it was just mainly bringing
water<00:02:56.799> in<00:02:57.040> there<00:02:57.250> but<00:02:57.280> hey<00:02:57.910> I'd<00:02:58.810> rather<00:02:58.989> get

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
water in there but hey I'd rather get

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.030 
water in there but hey I'd rather get
that<00:02:59.590> junk<00:03:00.220> out<00:03:00.400> of<00:03:00.579> there<00:03:00.930> then<00:03:01.930> leave<00:03:02.769> it<00:03:02.799> in

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
that junk out of there then leave it in

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.849 
that junk out of there then leave it in
there<00:03:03.250> but<00:03:03.579> I<00:03:03.790> turned<00:03:04.750> it<00:03:04.870> down<00:03:04.900> because<00:03:05.470> I<00:03:05.620> I

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:05.859 
there but I turned it down because I I

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:09.000 
there but I turned it down because I I
can't<00:03:06.250> be<00:03:06.370> doing<00:03:06.519> that<00:03:06.670> each<00:03:06.970> day<00:03:07.269> I<00:03:08.010> think

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
can't be doing that each day I think

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.660 
can't be doing that each day I think
it's<00:03:09.160> just<00:03:09.340> because<00:03:09.489> it's<00:03:09.670> nice<00:03:09.970> and<00:03:10.209> clean

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
it's just because it's nice and clean

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.319 
it's just because it's nice and clean
but<00:03:12.670> we'll<00:03:13.120> see<00:03:13.390> I<00:03:13.660> also<00:03:14.470> had<00:03:14.769> some<00:03:14.980> water

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
but we'll see I also had some water

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.590 
but we'll see I also had some water
dripping<00:03:16.329> from<00:03:16.630> the<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:17.560> rim<00:03:17.769> of<00:03:17.950> the<00:03:18.070> tank

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
dripping from the the rim of the tank

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.410 
dripping from the the rim of the tank
where<00:03:19.600> the<00:03:19.890> skimmer<00:03:20.890> pours<00:03:21.310> out<00:03:21.519> into<00:03:22.299> the

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
where the skimmer pours out into the

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.449 
where the skimmer pours out into the
tank<00:03:22.630> I'm<00:03:22.870> like<00:03:23.230> right<00:03:23.470> here<00:03:23.829> I've<00:03:24.370> been

much<00:04:40.099> and<00:04:40.460> I<00:04:40.520> noticed<00:04:41.150> that<00:04:41.330> it's<00:04:41.479> also<00:04:41.840> lost<00:04:42.080> a

00:04:42.309 --> 00:04:42.319 
much and I noticed that it's also lost a

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:44.589 
much and I noticed that it's also lost a
little<00:04:42.470> bit<00:04:42.620> of<00:04:42.680> his<00:04:42.830> color<00:04:43.039> I<00:04:43.310> can't<00:04:43.940> in<00:04:44.539> the

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:44.599 
little bit of his color I can't in the

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:46.600 
little bit of his color I can't in the
video<00:04:44.960> it<00:04:45.169> looks<00:04:45.199> tan<00:04:45.680> but<00:04:46.009> it's<00:04:46.160> actually

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
video it looks tan but it's actually

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.159 
video it looks tan but it's actually
green<00:04:46.849> but<00:04:47.810> it's<00:04:47.930> more<00:04:48.139> of<00:04:48.349> a<00:04:48.639> pinkish<00:04:49.639> green

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
green but it's more of a pinkish green

but I want to get it back to its normal

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:55.150 
but I want to get it back to its normal
color<00:04:52.970> so<00:04:53.389> I<00:04:53.419> might<00:04:53.870> move<00:04:53.990> it<00:04:54.169> over<00:04:54.380> to<00:04:54.530> the<00:04:54.680> T

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
built for it right now and I'm thinking

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.350 
built for it right now and I'm thinking
that<00:05:50.630> the<00:05:50.659> 29<00:05:51.409> might<00:05:51.740> be<00:05:51.949> my<00:05:52.190> new<00:05:52.880> saltwater

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360

like<00:05:57.199> this<00:05:57.409> tank<00:05:57.710> this<00:05:57.979> 10<00:05:58.219> gallon<00:05:58.490> will<00:05:58.610> set

00:05:58.779 --> 00:05:58.789 
like this tank this 10 gallon will set

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:00.339 
like this tank this 10 gallon will set
up<00:05:58.940> the<00:05:59.060> size<00:05:59.270> and<00:05:59.479> everything<00:05:59.930> and<00:06:00.080> the<00:06:00.169> light

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:00.349 
up the size and everything and the light

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:02.800 
up the size and everything and the light
works<00:06:00.620> for<00:06:00.979> it<00:06:01.130> but<00:06:01.400> I'm<00:06:02.120> gonna<00:06:02.210> have<00:06:02.479> to<00:06:02.630> get

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
works for it but I'm gonna have to get

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.620 
works for it but I'm gonna have to get
some<00:06:03.530> type<00:06:03.740> of<00:06:03.770> 150<00:06:04.729> watt<00:06:04.909> metal<00:06:05.120> halide<00:06:05.330> or

a<00:06:08.270> 17<00:06:09.229> inch<00:06:09.469> area<00:06:09.770> for<00:06:10.699> the<00:06:10.789> hexagon<00:06:12.159> so<00:06:13.419> I'll

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:14.419 
a 17 inch area for the hexagon so I'll

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:17.290 
a 17 inch area for the hexagon so I'll
be<00:06:14.630> searching<00:06:15.110> for<00:06:15.320> those<00:06:15.469> parts<00:06:16.400> so<00:06:16.639> I<00:06:17.090> can

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
be searching for those parts so I can

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.149 
be searching for those parts so I can
maybe<00:06:17.449> get<00:06:17.719> that<00:06:17.960> going<00:06:18.440> and<00:06:18.590> maybe<00:06:18.949> just

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:19.159 
maybe get that going and maybe just

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:22.600 
maybe get that going and maybe just
replace<00:06:19.580> this<00:06:19.759> whole<00:06:19.969> setup<00:06:20.349> with<00:06:21.349> the<00:06:21.610> 29

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:22.610 
replace this whole setup with the 29

that<00:06:26.210> I<00:06:26.300> got<00:06:26.449> to<00:06:26.630> fit<00:06:26.810> in<00:06:26.900> the<00:06:26.990> stand<00:06:27.440> so<00:06:27.740> we'll

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.130 
that I got to fit in the stand so we'll

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:32.320 
that I got to fit in the stand so we'll
see<00:06:28.280> I'll<00:06:29.000> keep<00:06:29.210> you<00:06:29.300> guys<00:06:29.389> updated<00:06:29.719> thank<00:06:30.199> you
