the<00:01:59.340> storm<00:01:59.369> and<00:02:00.079> wait<00:02:01.079> for<00:02:01.290> David<00:02:01.619> Danko's

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
the storm and wait for David Danko's

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.399 
the storm and wait for David Danko's
level<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.520> drop<00:02:02.790> because<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.630> knew<00:02:03.990> over<00:02:04.350> a

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
level to drop because I knew over a

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.889 
level to drop because I knew over a
five-set<00:02:05.070> match<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.670> am<00:02:06.000> mentally<00:02:06.390> tougher

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
five-set match I am mentally tougher

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.040 
five-set match I am mentally tougher
than<00:02:07.020> davidenko<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:08.149> I<00:02:09.149> like<00:02:09.840> my<00:02:10.020> chances

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
than davidenko and I like my chances

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.860 
than davidenko and I like my chances
despite<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:11.160> fact<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:11.550> I'm<00:02:11.790> not<00:02:12.209> doing<00:02:12.690> too

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
despite the fact that I'm not doing too

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.850 
despite the fact that I'm not doing too
well<00:02:12.900> right

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
well right

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.790 
well right
now<00:02:13.980> I<00:02:14.010> expect<00:02:14.700> there<00:02:14.880> to<00:02:14.910> be<00:02:15.030> a<00:02:15.150> shift<00:02:15.510> so<00:02:16.380> with

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
now I expect there to be a shift so with

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.970 
now I expect there to be a shift so with
that<00:02:17.010> positive<00:02:17.670> attitude<00:02:18.500> what<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:19.620> didn't

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
that positive attitude what you didn't

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.120 
that positive attitude what you didn't
have<00:02:20.190> was<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.480> drop<00:02:21.960> in<00:02:22.140> Federer's<00:02:22.590> performance

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
have was a drop in Federer's performance

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.280 
have was a drop in Federer's performance
because<00:02:24.090> what<00:02:24.270> you<00:02:24.360> sometimes<00:02:24.840> see<00:02:25.080> is

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
because what you sometimes see is

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.650 
because what you sometimes see is
momentum<00:02:25.980> goes<00:02:26.160> against<00:02:26.520> you<00:02:26.670> mental<00:02:27.450> state

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
momentum goes against you mental state

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.020 
momentum goes against you mental state
suffers<00:02:28.200> focus<00:02:28.920> suffers<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:29.550> as<00:02:29.790> a<00:02:29.820> result

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
suffers focus suffers and as a result

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.060 
suffers focus suffers and as a result
your<00:02:30.390> performance<00:02:30.930> suffers<00:02:31.140> and<00:02:31.500> then<00:02:31.950> it

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
your performance suffers and then it

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.800 
your performance suffers and then it
kind<00:02:32.280> of<00:02:32.340> starts<00:02:32.610> becoming<00:02:32.760> self<00:02:33.240> reinforcing

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
kind of starts becoming self reinforcing

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.270 
kind of starts becoming self reinforcing
then<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.470> momentum<00:02:34.890> is<00:02:34.950> even<00:02:35.130> further

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
then the momentum is even further

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.920 
then the momentum is even further
against<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:35.880> you<00:02:36.060> get<00:02:36.180> far<00:02:36.390> behind<00:02:36.510> you<00:02:36.780> lose

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
against you you get far behind you lose

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.949 
against you you get far behind you lose
but<00:02:37.770> that<00:02:38.100> didn't<00:02:38.460> happen<00:02:38.580> so<00:02:39.300> when<00:02:39.630> federer

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
but that didn't happen so when federer

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.890 
but that didn't happen so when federer
had<00:02:40.170> an<00:02:40.350> opportunity<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:41.510> take<00:02:42.510> control<00:02:42.780> of

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
had an opportunity to take control of

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.410 
had an opportunity to take control of
the<00:02:43.020> match<00:02:43.230> his<00:02:43.830> performance<00:02:44.459> was<00:02:45.090> ethically

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
the match his performance was ethically

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.720 
the match his performance was ethically
was<00:02:46.080> performing<00:02:46.530> well<00:02:46.680> so<00:02:47.070> he<00:02:47.400> was<00:02:47.550> in

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
was performing well so he was in

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.580 
was performing well so he was in
position<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.240> capitalize<00:02:48.540> on<00:02:49.110> those

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
position to capitalize on those

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.310 
position to capitalize on those
opportunities<00:02:50.270> well<00:02:51.270> how<00:02:51.510> about<00:02:51.540> David<00:02:52.020> enko

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
opportunities well how about David enko

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.250 
opportunities well how about David enko
as<00:02:52.530> soon<00:02:53.340> as<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.580> momentum<00:02:54.060> shifted<00:02:54.750> against

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
as soon as the momentum shifted against

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.130 
as soon as the momentum shifted against
him<00:02:55.580> something<00:02:56.580> happened<00:02:56.970> here<00:02:57.239> maybe<00:02:57.959> his

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
him something happened here maybe his

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.710 
him something happened here maybe his
mental<00:02:58.500> state<00:02:58.680> got<00:02:59.280> worse<00:02:59.520> he<00:02:59.970> certainly<00:03:00.420> lost

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
mental state got worse he certainly lost

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.690 
mental state got worse he certainly lost
focus<00:03:01.050> because<00:03:01.560> you<00:03:01.650> have<00:03:01.770> to<00:03:01.860> try<00:03:02.160> hard<00:03:02.489> at

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
focus because you have to try hard at

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.210 
focus because you have to try hard at
the<00:03:03.239> pro<00:03:03.480> level<00:03:03.510> to<00:03:03.959> lose<00:03:04.140> 13<00:03:04.620> straight<00:03:04.890> games

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
the pro level to lose 13 straight games

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.300 
the pro level to lose 13 straight games
and<00:03:05.540> obviously<00:03:06.540> his<00:03:06.870> performance<00:03:07.440> suffered

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
and obviously his performance suffered

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.930 
and obviously his performance suffered
so<00:03:09.239> you<00:03:09.300> had<00:03:09.890> we<00:03:10.890> can<00:03:11.040> sort<00:03:11.220> of<00:03:11.280> juxtapose

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
so you had we can sort of juxtapose

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.720 
so you had we can sort of juxtapose

Danko's mental state and how he reacts

Danko's mental state and how he reacts
to<00:03:40.350> shifts<00:03:40.709> in<00:03:40.799> momentum<00:03:41.190> that<00:03:41.880> certainly

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
to shifts in momentum that certainly

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.770 
to shifts in momentum that certainly
also<00:03:42.989> applies<00:03:43.320> to<00:03:43.350> Tsonga<00:03:44.040> because<00:03:44.970> Sango

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
also applies to Tsonga because Sango

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.340 
also applies to Tsonga because Sango
very<00:03:46.110> much<00:03:46.580> sometimes<00:03:47.580> loses<00:03:48.480> focus<00:03:48.720> when<00:03:49.200> the

very much sometimes loses focus when the

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
Momentum's against him and if we look at

Momentum's against him and if we look at
the<00:03:51.209> joke<00:03:51.450> of<00:03:51.630> each<00:03:51.750> match<00:03:52.019> his<00:03:52.680> quarterfinal

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120

the joke of each match his quarterfinal
he<00:03:54.120> won<00:03:54.299> the<00:03:54.390> first<00:03:54.570> set<00:03:54.750> in<00:03:54.840> a<00:03:54.870> close<00:03:55.080> breaker

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
he won the first set in a close breaker

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.860 
he won the first set in a close breaker
lost<00:03:56.160> the<00:03:56.370> second<00:03:56.730> set<00:03:56.880> in<00:03:57.030> a<00:03:57.330> close<00:03:57.570> breaker

the<00:04:00.480> third<00:04:01.170> set<00:04:01.500> 6-1<00:04:02.430> so<00:04:03.360> the<00:04:03.900> focus<00:04:04.200> wasn't

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
the third set 6-1 so the focus wasn't

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.039 
the third set 6-1 so the focus wasn't
quite<00:04:05.430> there<00:04:05.670> he<00:04:05.820> came<00:04:06.030> unraveled<00:04:06.269> a<00:04:06.780> little

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
quite there he came unraveled a little

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.430 
quite there he came unraveled a little
bit<00:04:07.200> so<00:04:07.920> we<00:04:08.220> had<00:04:08.400> that<00:04:08.580> progression<00:04:08.970> of

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
bit so we had that progression of

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.229 
bit so we had that progression of
momentum<00:04:10.440> against<00:04:10.799> him<00:04:10.980> mental<00:04:11.549> state<00:04:11.760> focus

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
momentum against him mental state focus

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.600 
momentum against him mental state focus
suffers<00:04:12.739> performance<00:04:13.739> drops<00:04:13.950> a<00:04:14.190> little<00:04:14.310> bit

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
suffers performance drops a little bit

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.490 
suffers performance drops a little bit
and<00:04:14.760> then<00:04:14.820> of<00:04:15.510> course<00:04:15.540> he<00:04:15.810> came<00:04:15.989> back<00:04:16.169> and<00:04:16.350> won

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
and then of course he came back and won

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.849 
and then of course he came back and won
that<00:04:16.680> match<00:04:16.950> when<00:04:17.669> Djokovic<00:04:18.120> got<00:04:18.959> sort<00:04:19.590> of<00:04:19.650> dry

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
that match when Djokovic got sort of dry

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.219 
that match when Djokovic got sort of dry
heaving<00:04:20.130> and<00:04:20.400> and<00:04:20.609> obviously<00:04:21.570> was<00:04:21.780> sick<00:04:22.020> and

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
heaving and and obviously was sick and

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.589 
heaving and and obviously was sick and
then<00:04:22.320> the<00:04:22.380> Momentum's<00:04:22.830> back<00:04:23.039> in<00:04:23.280> in<00:04:23.599> Tsongas

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:24.599 
then the Momentum's back in in Tsongas

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:26.480 
then the Momentum's back in in Tsongas
favor<00:04:24.870> but<00:04:25.140> song<00:04:25.380> I<00:04:25.410> didn't<00:04:25.770> do<00:04:25.919> anything<00:04:26.070> in

terms<00:04:26.669> of<00:04:26.849> his

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210

performance<00:04:27.660> to<00:04:28.440> change<00:04:29.009> that<00:04:29.250> momentum<00:04:29.850> it

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
performance to change that momentum it

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.670 
performance to change that momentum it
was<00:04:30.060> more<00:04:30.240> on<00:04:30.389> joke<00:04:30.660> of<00:04:30.840> itches<00:04:31.169> side<00:04:31.440> of<00:04:31.590> the

was more on joke of itches side of the

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.240 
was more on joke of itches side of the
court<00:04:32.150> so<00:04:33.150> what<00:04:33.990> we're<00:04:34.139> going<00:04:34.229> to<00:04:34.350> see<00:04:34.560> in<00:04:35.039> this

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
court so what we're going to see in this

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.129 
court so what we're going to see in this
match<00:04:35.550> and<00:04:35.759> a<00:04:35.849> semi-final<00:04:36.509> with<00:04:36.630> pros<00:04:36.870> this

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
match and a semi-final with pros this

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:39.260 
match and a semi-final with pros this
good<00:04:37.410> you're<00:04:38.009> going<00:04:38.130> to<00:04:38.190> have<00:04:38.370> swings<00:04:38.970> and

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
good you're going to have swings and

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.170 
good you're going to have swings and
momentum<00:04:39.810> it's<00:04:40.590> going<00:04:40.830> to<00:04:40.889> the<00:04:41.610> momentum<00:04:42.090> is

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
momentum it's going to the momentum is

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.730 
momentum it's going to the momentum is
going<00:04:42.300> to<00:04:42.360> be<00:04:42.449> kind<00:04:42.750> of<00:04:42.870> like<00:04:42.960> a<00:04:42.990> squiggly<00:04:43.349> line

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
going to be kind of like a squiggly line

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.950 
going to be kind of like a squiggly line
where<00:04:44.099> this<00:04:44.610> might<00:04:44.849> be<00:04:45.030> momentum<00:04:45.479> for<00:04:45.660> Federer

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
where this might be momentum for Federer

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.400 
where this might be momentum for Federer
this<00:04:46.319> is<00:04:46.500> momentum<00:04:47.460> for<00:04:47.699> Tsonga<00:04:48.180> and<00:04:48.389> so<00:04:49.169> on

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
this is momentum for Tsonga and so on

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.710 
this is momentum for Tsonga and so on
the<00:04:49.590> momentum<00:04:50.039> shifts<00:04:50.460> over<00:04:50.669> the<00:04:50.759> course<00:04:51.000> of<00:04:51.180> a

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
the momentum shifts over the course of a

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.070 
the momentum shifts over the course of a
match<00:04:51.930> at<00:04:52.169> epson<00:04:52.530> it<00:04:52.650> flows<00:04:53.270> so<00:04:54.270> the<00:04:54.660> question

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
match at epson it flows so the question

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.249 
match at epson it flows so the question
is<00:04:55.289> when<00:04:55.979> the<00:04:56.520> momentum<00:04:57.000> is<00:04:57.180> against<00:04:57.720> Tsonga

00:04:58.249 --> 00:04:58.259 
is when the momentum is against Tsonga

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:00.290 
is when the momentum is against Tsonga
how<00:04:58.440> is<00:04:58.590> he<00:04:58.680> going<00:04:58.830> to<00:04:58.889> react<00:04:59.280> is<00:04:59.550> he<00:04:59.880> going<00:05:00.270> to

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
how is he going to react is he going to

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.330 
how is he going to react is he going to
lose<00:05:00.750> focus<00:05:01.020> as<00:05:01.380> his<00:05:01.500> mental<00:05:01.830> state<00:05:02.009> is<00:05:02.220> he

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
lose focus as his mental state is he

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.070 
lose focus as his mental state is he
going<00:05:02.460> to<00:05:02.490> get<00:05:02.639> down<00:05:02.789> on<00:05:02.849> himself<00:05:03.120> and<00:05:03.509> will

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
going to get down on himself and will

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.779 
going to get down on himself and will
that<00:05:04.259> negatively<00:05:04.740> impact<00:05:05.430> his<00:05:05.639> performance

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:05.789 
that negatively impact his performance

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:09.140 
that negatively impact his performance
because<00:05:06.240> we've<00:05:06.389> seen<00:05:06.720> that<00:05:06.949> so<00:05:07.949> if<00:05:08.400> that

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
because we've seen that so if that

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.719 
because we've seen that so if that
happens<00:05:09.690> Federer's<00:05:10.289> got<00:05:10.530> a<00:05:10.740> fantastic<00:05:11.220> shot

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:11.729 
happens Federer's got a fantastic shot

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:14.120 
happens Federer's got a fantastic shot
at<00:05:11.970> winning<00:05:12.660> this<00:05:12.900> match<00:05:13.139> because<00:05:13.650> when<00:05:14.039> the

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
at winning this match because when the

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.740 
at winning this match because when the
Momentum's<00:05:14.820> against<00:05:15.090> Federer<00:05:15.389> he's<00:05:15.539> going<00:05:15.690> to

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
Momentum's against Federer he's going to

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:16.999 
Momentum's against Federer he's going to
be<00:05:15.810> just<00:05:15.840> fine<00:05:16.050> he's<00:05:16.410> going<00:05:16.530> to<00:05:16.590> figure<00:05:16.740> out<00:05:16.979> a

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:17.009 
be just fine he's going to figure out a

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:19.939 
be just fine he's going to figure out a
way<00:05:17.220> to<00:05:17.280> shift<00:05:18.180> things<00:05:18.389> back<00:05:18.780> in<00:05:19.050> his<00:05:19.620> favor

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:19.949 
way to shift things back in his favor

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:21.969 
way to shift things back in his favor
his<00:05:20.580> performance<00:05:21.090> isn't<00:05:21.240> going<00:05:21.479> to<00:05:21.539> suffer

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
his performance isn't going to suffer

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:24.830 
his performance isn't going to suffer
and<00:05:22.979> in<00:05:23.099> terms<00:05:23.280> of<00:05:23.460> the<00:05:23.610> actual<00:05:23.759> what<00:05:24.659> you<00:05:24.750> know

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
and in terms of the actual what you know

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.629 
and in terms of the actual what you know
what<00:05:24.990> Tsonga<00:05:25.650> needs<00:05:25.860> to<00:05:25.979> do<00:05:26.130> to<00:05:26.159> win<00:05:26.460> this

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 
what Tsonga needs to do to win this

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:29.570 
what Tsonga needs to do to win this
match<00:05:26.909> it's<00:05:27.780> relatively<00:05:28.710> simple<00:05:28.830> in<00:05:29.159> my<00:05:29.310> view

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
match it's relatively simple in my view

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.490 
match it's relatively simple in my view
he<00:05:29.669> has<00:05:29.759> to<00:05:29.880> serve<00:05:30.120> big<00:05:30.449> and<00:05:30.690> he<00:05:31.139> has<00:05:31.259> to<00:05:31.409> hit

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
he has to serve big and he has to hit

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.800 
he has to serve big and he has to hit
his<00:05:31.650> forehand<00:05:32.070> big<00:05:32.340> shortened<00:05:33.210> points<00:05:33.570> keep

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
his forehand big shortened points keep

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.170 
his forehand big shortened points keep
the<00:05:33.960> ball<00:05:34.139> away<00:05:34.259> from<00:05:34.560> his<00:05:34.680> backhand<00:05:35.190> which<00:05:35.970> is

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
the ball away from his backhand which is

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.330 
the ball away from his backhand which is
clearly<00:05:36.570> as<00:05:36.870> weaker<00:05:37.229> side<00:05:37.440> and<00:05:37.800> aside<00:05:38.099> that

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
clearly as weaker side and aside that

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.100 
clearly as weaker side and aside that
federer<00:05:38.699> is<00:05:38.880> going<00:05:39.120> to<00:05:39.210> be<00:05:39.330> able<00:05:39.479> to<00:05:39.720> exploit

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
federer is going to be able to exploit

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.290 
federer is going to be able to exploit
so<00:05:40.919> I<00:05:40.949> don't<00:05:41.130> think<00:05:41.280> the<00:05:41.340> tactics<00:05:41.849> here<00:05:42.090> are

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
so I don't think the tactics here are

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.620 
so I don't think the tactics here are
that<00:05:43.169> complicated<00:05:44.009> or<00:05:44.340> that<00:05:44.580> sophisticated<00:05:45.330> I

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630 
that complicated or that sophisticated I

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.189 
that complicated or that sophisticated I
think<00:05:46.169> the<00:05:46.289> main<00:05:46.530> question<00:05:46.800> is<00:05:48.020> what's<00:05:49.020> going

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 
think the main question is what's going

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:51.620 
think the main question is what's going
to<00:05:49.259> be<00:05:49.409> the<00:05:49.440> deal<00:05:49.800> with<00:05:50.490> song<00:05:50.789> as<00:05:51.000> mental<00:05:51.419> state

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
to be the deal with song as mental state

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.270 
to be the deal with song as mental state
is<00:05:51.810> he<00:05:52.080> going<00:05:52.229> to<00:05:52.259> be<00:05:52.320> able<00:05:52.409> to<00:05:52.650> remain<00:05:52.889> focused

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
is he going to be able to remain focused

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.350 
is he going to be able to remain focused
over<00:05:54.180> five<00:05:54.960> sets<00:05:55.349> and<00:05:55.650> be<00:05:56.099> able<00:05:56.250> to<00:05:56.430> execute<00:05:56.880> at

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
over five sets and be able to execute at

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.659 
over five sets and be able to execute at
a<00:05:57.750> high<00:05:58.050> level<00:05:58.080> because<00:05:58.949> if<00:05:59.130> this<00:05:59.340> comes

00:05:59.659 --> 00:05:59.669 
a high level because if this comes

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:03.499 
a high level because if this comes
unraveled<00:05:59.960> then<00:06:00.960> he's<00:06:01.919> going<00:06:02.130> to<00:06:02.190> lose<00:06:02.509> for

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:03.509 
unraveled then he's going to lose for

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:05.300 
unraveled then he's going to lose for
sure<00:06:03.539> I<00:06:03.690> mean<00:06:03.930> he's<00:06:04.229> got<00:06:04.349> no<00:06:04.530> shot<00:06:04.800> if<00:06:05.039> he's<00:06:05.190> not

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
sure I mean he's got no shot if he's not

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.020 
sure I mean he's got no shot if he's not
mentally<00:06:05.729> focused<00:06:06.030> the<00:06:06.780> entire<00:06:06.900> match<00:06:07.380> and

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.030 
mentally focused the entire match and

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.700 
mentally focused the entire match and
again<00:06:09.030> history<00:06:09.840> would<00:06:09.960> suggest<00:06:10.199> he's<00:06:10.530> not

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710 
again history would suggest he's not

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.610 
again history would suggest he's not
always<00:06:11.090> quite<00:06:12.090> there<00:06:12.419> in<00:06:12.690> terms<00:06:13.020> of<00:06:13.289> being

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620 
always quite there in terms of being

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.089 
always quite there in terms of being
zeroed<00:06:14.070> in<00:06:14.250> at<00:06:14.490> the<00:06:14.610> task<00:06:14.849> task<00:06:15.389> at<00:06:15.719> hand<00:06:16.070> so<00:06:17.070> I

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:17.099 
zeroed in at the task task at hand so I

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:19.159 
zeroed in at the task task at hand so I
think<00:06:17.310> that<00:06:17.849> federer<00:06:18.599> is<00:06:18.719> going<00:06:18.840> to<00:06:18.900> win<00:06:19.050> this

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:19.169 
think that federer is going to win this

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:21.050 
think that federer is going to win this
match<00:06:19.409> in<00:06:19.680> four<00:06:20.340> sets<00:06:20.610> i<00:06:20.759> think<00:06:20.940> we're

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 
match in four sets i think we're

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.670 
match in four sets i think we're
definitely<00:06:21.270> definitely<00:06:21.930> going<00:06:22.409> to<00:06:22.500> see

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
definitely definitely going to see

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.649 
definitely definitely going to see
spurts<00:06:23.130> where<00:06:23.280> Tsonga<00:06:23.789> is<00:06:23.909> locked<00:06:24.180> in<00:06:24.419> and

spurts where Tsonga is locked in and

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:27.560 
spurts where Tsonga is locked in and
playing<00:06:25.349> big<00:06:25.740> and<00:06:26.039> we've<00:06:26.909> seen<00:06:27.180> that<00:06:27.330> earlier

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:27.570 
playing big and we've seen that earlier

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:29.779 
playing big and we've seen that earlier
in<00:06:28.440> this<00:06:28.590> tournament<00:06:28.919> where<00:06:29.340> he's<00:06:29.490> hitting

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:29.789 
in this tournament where he's hitting

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:31.999 
in this tournament where he's hitting
his<00:06:29.880> serve<00:06:30.090> big<00:06:30.419> hitting<00:06:31.139> his<00:06:31.320> forehand<00:06:31.740> big

00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:32.009 
his serve big hitting his forehand big

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:34.810 
his serve big hitting his forehand big
but<00:06:32.820> then<00:06:32.940> you<00:06:33.030> also<00:06:33.210> have<00:06:33.330> situations<00:06:34.110> where

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:34.820 
but then you also have situations where

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.060 
but then you also have situations where

Tsonga against almagro in the fourth set

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.279 
Tsonga against almagro in the fourth set
breaker<00:06:38.400> of<00:06:38.789> that<00:06:38.940> match<00:06:39.210> he's<00:06:39.870> going<00:06:40.050> for

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:40.289 
breaker of that match he's going for

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:41.060 
breaker of that match he's going for
second<00:06:40.680> survey

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.070 
second survey

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:42.320 
second survey
he's<00:06:41.280> trying<00:06:41.430> to<00:06:41.520> hit<00:06:41.640> as<00:06:41.730> hard<00:06:41.880> as<00:06:42.030> he<00:06:42.120> can

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:42.330 
he's trying to hit as hard as he can

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.220 
he's trying to hit as hard as he can
that's<00:06:42.960> just<00:06:43.140> not<00:06:43.410> a<00:06:43.440> very<00:06:43.620> smart<00:06:43.980> play<00:06:44.670> from<00:06:45.230> a

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:46.230 
that's just not a very smart play from a

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:49.160 
that's just not a very smart play from a
tactical<00:06:46.680> perspective<00:06:47.130> and<00:06:47.820> you<00:06:48.810> could<00:06:48.990> see

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:49.170 
tactical perspective and you could see

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:51.710 
tactical perspective and you could see
mentally<00:06:49.710> you<00:06:49.860> know<00:06:49.890> that<00:06:50.510> he<00:06:51.510> wasn't

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 
mentally you know that he wasn't

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.690 
mentally you know that he wasn't
thinking<00:06:52.230> straight<00:06:52.380> his<00:06:52.710> focus<00:06:52.980> wasn't<00:06:53.340> quite

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:53.700 
thinking straight his focus wasn't quite

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.310 
thinking straight his focus wasn't quite
there<00:06:53.910> you<00:06:54.120> shouldn't<00:06:54.390> be<00:06:54.510> trying<00:06:54.750> to<00:06:54.840> blast<00:06:55.080> a

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:55.320 
there you shouldn't be trying to blast a

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.310 
there you shouldn't be trying to blast a
serve<00:06:55.530> 130<00:06:56.160> plus<00:06:56.760> in<00:06:57.030> a<00:06:57.510> huge<00:06:57.750> moment<00:06:58.020> like

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:58.320 
serve 130 plus in a huge moment like

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.960 
serve 130 plus in a huge moment like
there<00:06:58.560> when<00:06:58.800> it's<00:06:58.950> just<00:06:59.160> not<00:06:59.310> the<00:06:59.490> highest

00:06:59.960 --> 00:06:59.970 
there when it's just not the highest

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:01.970 
there when it's just not the highest
percentage<00:07:00.240> play<00:07:00.780> there's<00:07:01.440> other<00:07:01.620> things<00:07:01.710> he

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:01.980 
percentage play there's other things he

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.290 
percentage play there's other things he
could<00:07:02.130> have<00:07:02.220> done<00:07:02.340> to<00:07:02.400> one<00:07:02.640> that<00:07:02.820> to<00:07:03.000> have<00:07:03.120> one

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:03.300 
could have done to one that to have one

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.560 
could have done to one that to have one
that<00:07:03.480> point<00:07:03.750> so<00:07:04.560> I<00:07:04.890> think<00:07:05.880> fed<00:07:06.240> wins<00:07:06.450> this

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:06.570 
that point so I think fed wins this

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:08.360 
that point so I think fed wins this
match<00:07:06.780> in<00:07:06.990> four<00:07:07.290> sets<00:07:07.560> again<00:07:07.890> song<00:07:08.190> is

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:08.370 
match in four sets again song is

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:10.150 
match in four sets again song is
definitely<00:07:08.760> have<00:07:08.850> his<00:07:08.880> opportunities<00:07:09.540> and

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160 
definitely have his opportunities and

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.320 
definitely have his opportunities and
he's<00:07:11.160> got<00:07:11.370> such<00:07:11.550> a<00:07:11.580> big<00:07:11.790> game<00:07:12.000> he's<00:07:12.150> such<00:07:12.300> a

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:12.330 
he's got such a big game he's such a

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.750 
he's got such a big game he's such a
talented<00:07:12.540> player<00:07:12.930> that<00:07:13.320> he<00:07:13.920> certainly<00:07:14.520> has

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:14.760 
talented player that he certainly has

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.390 
talented player that he certainly has
the<00:07:14.790> game<00:07:15.150> to<00:07:15.450> to<00:07:15.780> give<00:07:15.930> feta<00:07:16.200> or<00:07:16.470> a<00:07:16.680> run<00:07:17.190> for

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:17.400 
the game to to give feta or a run for

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.400 
the game to to give feta or a run for
his<00:07:17.460> money<00:07:17.520> but<00:07:18.420> I<00:07:18.450> think<00:07:18.570> Federer<00:07:18.960> pulls<00:07:19.260> it

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:19.410 
his money but I think Federer pulls it

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:23.300 
his money but I think Federer pulls it
out<00:07:19.530> in<00:07:20.060> four<00:07:21.060> sets<00:07:21.330> if<00:07:21.660> you<00:07:22.410> know<00:07:22.500> Federer

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:23.310 
out in four sets if you know Federer

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:25.220 
out in four sets if you know Federer
gets<00:07:23.520> down<00:07:23.760> after<00:07:24.390> seeing<00:07:24.630> the<00:07:24.690> davit<00:07:24.990> ankle

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:25.230 
gets down after seeing the davit ankle

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:26.930 
gets down after seeing the davit ankle
match<00:07:25.410> I<00:07:25.590> have<00:07:25.680> no<00:07:25.830> question<00:07:26.280> in<00:07:26.340> my<00:07:26.370> mind<00:07:26.460> that

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:26.940 
match I have no question in my mind that

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.970 
match I have no question in my mind that
he's<00:07:27.570> going<00:07:27.720> to<00:07:27.810> be<00:07:27.930> able<00:07:28.230> to<00:07:28.410> just<00:07:28.680> wait<00:07:28.950> it

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:28.980 
he's going to be able to just wait it

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:32.120 
he's going to be able to just wait it
out<00:07:29.220> and<00:07:29.490> twist<00:07:30.420> the<00:07:30.600> twist<00:07:31.560> the<00:07:31.680> momentum

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:32.130 
out and twist the twist the momentum

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:34.040 
out and twist the twist the momentum
shift<00:07:32.370> the<00:07:32.490> momentum<00:07:32.940> back<00:07:33.120> in<00:07:33.300> his<00:07:33.420> favor<00:07:33.660> and

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:34.050 
shift the momentum back in his favor and

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:36.530 
shift the momentum back in his favor and
like<00:07:35.040> we've<00:07:35.220> been<00:07:35.370> doing<00:07:35.700> over<00:07:35.910> the<00:07:36.120> course<00:07:36.150> of

like we've been doing over the course of

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.030 
like we've been doing over the course of
