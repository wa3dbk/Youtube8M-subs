00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:10.559
 hocus pocus 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:26.829
 which pro series should be white 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:29.610
 spikelets must be returned upside down so 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:29.610
 shimmer beautifully 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.510
 2 hooks over the month 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:50.589
 close 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:55.510
 necklace 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.510
 Odessa Arbi such 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.330
 this thought 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.490
 but then I'm such a set 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:21.030
 here you are all the rhinestones 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.030
 carnations 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:34.220
 it is necessary to measure the length and how it opens 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.220
 which call here I will show 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:02:01.780
 45 cm came set evaluation 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:05.579
 Judging by the weight of Oksana, the Chinese got out 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:10.179
 the air we remember the rack with 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:24.069
 suspicion that it is foam because 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:26.500
 no track came points 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.470
 olya ray ban by the way for the first time me 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.709
 the seller did not give trek code 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:34.420
 Well, to be honest, they are ordered by 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:37.540
 interest is not worth 4 do not need the same 2 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.319
 a dollar can generally brain and by the way 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.500
 small 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:48.940
 Chinese markets sell curves 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:50.859
 In short, look straight quite peck like 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.400
 told tanne well not exactly a curve 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:57.819
 crooked just immediately looked at 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.669
 sympathetic happens like this, these figures 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.859
 not everyone bends yes everything means we 

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:05.440
 to regulate 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:09.160
 no ignoring that's it would 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:12.760
 ok and so from here to here 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.859
 because it is for some important 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:19.690
 moment 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:24.269
 minutes in a straight line as roughly 14 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:27.389
 14 14 half somewhere so usually 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.389
 yes principle
