00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.210
 to the beautiful welcome to the channel the day 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.670
 today I bring you this makeup that is 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.440
 formed a rather dramatic hope 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.750
 that you like is very simple to do 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.250
 and that 's all girls I leave with 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.900
 the tutorial I send you a kiss 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.900
 thank you very much for joining me there 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.290
 good as always we're going to start 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.370
 apply a shadow prebase 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:41.470
 applying this demo tips and I'm going to 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.470
 apply with a pretty loose brush 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.030
 now 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.770
 so that the zones last longer and that 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.770
 it is easier to blur the 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.870
 mixed the blizzard and the vanilla 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:01.670
 which are for me one of the best 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:04.239
 combination to illuminate the bone of the 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.560
 eyebrow and then we will apply 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.340
 blurring it down until you get 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.340
 up to the fold 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.630
 then I'm going to take that tonality 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.270
 cappuccino and wine and I'm going to mix them 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:26.180
 in the brush a little bit and it's going to be a 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:28.310
 transition color that I'm going to put 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.760
 and that will help me start 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.330
 Blur down on the fold very 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.330
 mild 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.750
 then I will continue with the cappuccino 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:47.330
 and I'm going to use a fold-up brush 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.730
 the raised brand and I'm going to use it 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:54.370
 to start marking the fold of a 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.370
 quite pronounced way 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.229
 I'm going to use this shadow that is native that 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.230
 It's one of my favorites to die if 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:17.460
 comes in the in the element palette 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:21.660
 color box and I will use it 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:26.030
 to give a little more of a tone more 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.030
 warm in the play part 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:43.150
 Then I'll take this shadow 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:46.090
 flame choco light of motives this and the 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.760
 I'm going to put it on as my color 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.780
 to mark the fold with the same 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:55.640
 crise brush 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.640
 that's what we're going to do 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.030
 then we are going to take this black shadow 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.590
 or nicks and we're going to mix it with either 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:21.350
 chocolate with 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:24.650
 hot chocolate chocolate 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.840
 If so, let's mix to mix 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:31.430
 all three but then you can use the most 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:34.870
 these two or these two and with that one 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.870
 mixed tonality 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:43.500
 and with that mixed hue we're going to 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:47.000
 start a sea even more 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.000
 in the crease part 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.550
 to do the outline we will use 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:05.580
 this gel eyeliner motifs which is the 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.200
 book black 3 that I almost finished the 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.870
 second jar 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:14.239
 and looking at each other in the mirror they go 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.239
 try to start drawing the line 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.500
 now I'm going to apply these lashes the 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.500
 brand 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.330
 flashes that are called 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.270
 dawn 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:25.150
 ok later I'm going to take this pencil 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:29.760
 eyeliner that is in tone coffee 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.760
 and I'm going to delineate the water line 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:37.470
 is quite dark ends so 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.470
 let's blur this down 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:45.740
 with a thin brush and more shadow 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.740
 dark 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:06:00.340
 to illuminate I'm going to use this shadow 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:00.340
 what is craig 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.620
 all right 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.520
 We are going to apply it on the lacrimal
