00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:10.309
 back back 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:10.309
 no over and step back ago 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.219
 passions and tantrums but what awaits 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.619
 you in kruger national park 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:24.250
 when a huge rock python climbs 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:26.770
 in the car just do not get out of it is necessary 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.290
 take a photo of marlins ward and her friend 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:34.960
 he is with you covering the floor windows but waiting for them 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:36.760
 real shock python crawled straight to 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.579
 our car from another country is not 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:47.409
 appeared and people around us accepted 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:49.600
 laugh you take off that shockingly buy 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:52.050
 we have stupid teeth and he has enough 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:57.600
 forces to strangle a child 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:01:00.300
 horror Marlene Leon snake creeps like this 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.309
 become snakes like other reptiles 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.590
 cold-blooded creatures they keep warm 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.930
 thanks to the external heat source of the nose 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.850
 and probably this snake crawled under the hood 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.920
 because the engine was hot after 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.920
 this work and it was nice and warm 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.820
 surrounded by wild animals in the park 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:23.410
 kruger is too dangerous to get out of 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:25.360
 cars just do not get out of it Marlene 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.820
 it will appear that the snake can crawl through 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.850
 air water they need to get into 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.570
 safe place to take away from us 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.630
 whole caravan 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.520
 it's so fun and when we got to 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.750
 tops of the hill did he open the hood 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:44.550
 cried out and asked me to bring cameras 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:51.509
 by my God go take photographs 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:56.649
 now you believe you don't believe me here 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:02:01.180
 right next to the engine, he look 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:06.550
 sleeping wait a minute 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:11.340
 this is certainly not waiting quietly let 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.340
 pose next to him come here 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:22.420
 we had no idea how big 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:24.250
 there was a snake before we saw that such 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.660
 a large snake crawled into a small 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.690
 limited space seems 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.610
 strange but rock pythons 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.650
 are arranged so they can hunt in the most 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.670
 narrow crevices where caps are found 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:39.430
 kidomaru this massive snake and she doesn't 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:43.560
 able to move fast but for prey 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.560
 yet rush with lightning speed 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.850
 or he is aware of the danger 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:53.530
 nothing threatens me if he doesn't 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:57.550
 will be near the head of the snake did he start 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.470
 stroke the kites here to arrange here 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.370
 transparent hood and the car no one even 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.370
 think to steal 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:08.050
 he took her tail and pulled change 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.560
 crawled out of the car in the same way as 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.560
 semi well 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:32.080
 can it was incredibly worth 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:34.959
 move the car roads I'm very afraid 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.599
 the serpent and now when i see the serpent on 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:40.870
 the road is better stop than fit 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:42.819
 not close because it can happen 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.069
 that I will be alone and not near 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.900
 no one would help 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:49.299
 That's the problem with the hitchhiker me 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.430
 they show their character and only 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.940
 then when it comes to the car and then 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.940
 too late
