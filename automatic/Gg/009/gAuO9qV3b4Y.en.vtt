but<00:02:11.790> that's<00:02:11.940> where<00:02:12.209> that<00:02:12.420> very<00:02:12.720> tight<00:02:13.080> black

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
but that's where that very tight black

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.070 
but that's where that very tight black
suit<00:02:13.890> doesn't<00:02:14.220> really<00:02:14.580> bother<00:02:15.209> him<00:02:15.629> that<00:02:15.870> much

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
suit doesn't really bother him that much

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.559 
suit doesn't really bother him that much
but<00:02:16.410> it's<00:02:16.739> a<00:02:16.860> good<00:02:17.069> movie<00:02:17.550> I<00:02:17.700> recommend<00:02:18.390> it

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.150 
but it's a good movie I recommend it

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
it's quite sharp it's a bit cutting-edge

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.199 
it's quite sharp it's a bit cutting-edge
and<00:02:24.150> it's<00:02:24.870> maybe<00:02:25.379> a<00:02:25.560> little<00:02:25.920> bit<00:02:26.280> old<00:02:26.550> but<00:02:26.849> it

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
and it's maybe a little bit old but it

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.940 
and it's maybe a little bit old but it
doesn't<00:02:27.660> feel<00:02:28.069> rusty<00:02:30.140> okay<00:02:31.140> so<00:02:31.200> yeah<00:02:31.560> I<00:02:31.620> gotta

movie and what do you know the two
issues<00:02:40.890> oppose<00:02:41.430> each<00:02:41.459> other<00:02:41.879> first<00:02:42.269> well

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
issues oppose each other first well

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.630 
issues oppose each other first well
maybe<00:02:42.989> I<00:02:43.140> have<00:02:43.440> a<00:02:43.470> little<00:02:43.739> bit<00:02:43.980> of<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.160> biased

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
maybe I have a little bit of a biased

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.850 
maybe I have a little bit of a biased
against<00:02:45.120> Edward<00:02:45.329> just<00:02:45.900> because<00:02:46.200> I<00:02:46.319> was<00:02:46.590> always

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
against Edward just because I was always

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.430 
against Edward just because I was always
told<00:02:47.280> never<00:02:47.760> to<00:02:47.910> run<00:02:48.299> with<00:02:48.540> scissors<00:02:48.810> but<00:02:49.410> I

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
told never to run with scissors but I

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.380 
told never to run with scissors but I
just<00:02:49.769> don't<00:02:50.040> get<00:02:50.220> how<00:02:50.430> King<00:02:50.730> fell<00:02:51.000> in<00:02:51.180> love

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
just don't get how King fell in love

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.140 
just don't get how King fell in love
with<00:02:51.630> Edward<00:02:52.140> don't<00:02:52.560> get<00:02:52.769> me<00:02:52.950> wrong<00:02:52.980> yes<00:02:53.730> you

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
with Edward don't get me wrong yes you

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
can fall in love with someone who has

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.850 
can fall in love with someone who has
scissors<00:02:56.760> for<00:02:57.329> hands<00:02:57.599> I<00:02:57.989> just<00:02:58.379> don't<00:02:58.560> think

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
scissors for hands I just don't think

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.259 
scissors for hands I just don't think
the<00:02:59.010> movie<00:02:59.280> really<00:02:59.610> explored<00:03:00.269> that

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
the movie really explored that

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.390 
the movie really explored that
relationship<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:01.470> offered<00:03:01.860> him<00:03:02.129> to

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
relationship and offered him to

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.210 
relationship and offered him to
basically<00:03:03.060> risk<00:03:03.510> everything<00:03:04.230> for<00:03:04.470> Edward

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
basically risk everything for Edward

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.729 
basically risk everything for Edward
especially<00:03:06.060> since<00:03:06.269> she<00:03:06.720> was<00:03:06.900> such<00:03:07.170> a<00:03:07.200> jerk

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
especially since she was such a jerk

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.220 
especially since she was such a jerk
when<00:03:08.069> she<00:03:08.280> first<00:03:08.640> met<00:03:09.030> him<00:03:09.180> I<00:03:09.420> don't<00:03:09.720> blame<00:03:09.989> her

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
when she first met him I don't blame her

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.930 
when she first met him I don't blame her
though<00:03:10.440> how<00:03:10.620> would<00:03:10.799> you<00:03:11.040> feel<00:03:11.280> if<00:03:11.519> a<00:03:11.670> pale

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
though how would you feel if a pale

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.390 
though how would you feel if a pale
scarred<00:03:12.510> up<00:03:12.690> man<00:03:13.019> with<00:03:13.349> scissors<00:03:13.799> for<00:03:14.040> hands

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
still totally a superficial slut but I

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:21.559 
still totally a superficial slut but I
can<00:03:20.130> totally<00:03:20.310> see<00:03:20.819> what<00:03:21.030> she<00:03:21.239> was<00:03:21.389> so

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
can totally see what she was so

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:23.599 
can totally see what she was so
defensive<00:03:21.840> again<00:03:22.709> soon<00:03:22.980> this<00:03:23.220> is<00:03:23.400> just

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
defensive again soon this is just

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.400 
defensive again soon this is just
nitpicking<00:03:24.239> though<00:03:24.510> because<00:03:24.780> this<00:03:25.139> is<00:03:25.380> a

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
nitpicking though because this is a

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.650 
nitpicking though because this is a
movie<00:03:25.769> where<00:03:26.010> a<00:03:26.040> woman<00:03:26.459> practically<00:03:27.060> has<00:03:27.420> an

orgasm<00:03:27.930> over<00:03:28.500> a<00:03:28.769> haircut<00:03:29.579> a<00:03:29.880> movie<00:03:30.329> where<00:03:30.540> a

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
orgasm over a haircut a movie where a

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.229 
orgasm over a haircut a movie where a
guy<00:03:31.049> thinks<00:03:31.530> it's<00:03:31.739> smart<00:03:32.220> to<00:03:32.430> have<00:03:32.730> a<00:03:32.790> fist

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
guy thinks it's smart to have a fist

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.120 
guy thinks it's smart to have a fist
fight<00:03:33.510> with<00:03:33.569> somebody<00:03:34.079> who's<00:03:34.440> fists<00:03:34.859> are

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
fight with somebody who's fists are

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.960 
fight with somebody who's fists are
razor-sharp<00:03:35.760> blades<00:03:36.660> but<00:03:37.349> Edward<00:03:38.099> did<00:03:38.489> make

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
razor-sharp blades but Edward did make

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.360 
razor-sharp blades but Edward did make
it<00:03:39.180> snow<00:03:39.480> so<00:03:39.840> I<00:03:40.049> guess<00:03:40.410> it<00:03:40.620> does<00:03:40.980> make<00:03:41.340> sense

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
it snow so I guess it does make sense

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.640 
it snow so I guess it does make sense
that<00:03:41.970> you<00:03:42.209> would<00:03:42.239> fall<00:03:42.690> in<00:03:42.810> love<00:03:43.049> with<00:03:43.230> him<00:03:43.349> you

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
that you would fall in love with him you

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.190 
that you would fall in love with him you
know<00:03:43.889> what<00:03:44.130> guys<00:03:44.400> just<00:03:45.150> make<00:03:45.419> it<00:03:45.450> snow<00:03:45.930> and

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
know what guys just make it snow and

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.430 
know what guys just make it snow and
you'll<00:03:46.470> get<00:03:46.739> them<00:03:46.950> girls<00:03:47.489> wet<00:03:48.230> because<00:03:49.230> it's

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
you'll get them girls wet because it's

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.259 
you'll get them girls wet because it's
ice<00:03:49.680> ice<00:03:50.099> melt<00:03:50.910> and<00:03:51.299> it<00:03:52.049> gets<00:03:52.260> you<00:03:52.440> wet<00:03:53.269> the
