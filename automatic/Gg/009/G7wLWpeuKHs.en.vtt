here is how it looks as you can see the

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:50.959 
here is how it looks as you can see the
chicken<00:01:49.799> fritters<00:01:50.189> there's<00:01:50.369> about<00:01:50.520> six<00:01:50.819> of

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:50.969 
chicken fritters there's about six of

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
but it's theirs they're probably the

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.020 
but it's theirs they're probably the
equivalent<00:01:56.429> of<00:01:56.880> two<00:01:57.749> chicken<00:01:58.469> nuggets<00:01:59.030> in

00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:03.389 
terms of chicken amount the spaghetti is

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:05.120

on the inside um I don't I don't know if
I<00:04:32.480> can<00:04:32.660> actually<00:04:33.190> distinguish<00:04:34.190> what<00:04:34.490> part<00:04:34.730> is

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.670 
I can actually distinguish what part is
chicken<00:04:35.090> and<00:04:35.210> what<00:04:35.360> part<00:04:35.570> is<00:04:35.690> batter<00:04:35.960> she's

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
chicken and what part is batter she's

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.830 
chicken and what part is batter she's
kind<00:04:36.889> of<00:04:36.919> like<00:04:37.040> all<00:04:37.280> mixed<00:04:37.790> together<00:04:37.880> it's<00:04:38.690> not

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
kind of like all mixed together it's not

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:39.520 
kind of like all mixed together it's not
horrible

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
horrible

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.870 
horrible
but<00:04:40.250> it's<00:04:40.340> really<00:04:40.520> like<00:04:40.790> fried<00:04:41.630> chicken<00:04:42.080> skin

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880

batter<00:04:44.020> rolled<00:04:45.020> up<00:04:45.169> in<00:04:45.350> balls<00:04:45.590> and<00:04:46.210> maybe

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
batter rolled up in balls and maybe

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.850 
batter rolled up in balls and maybe
that's<00:04:47.450> why<00:04:47.660> it's<00:04:47.840> not<00:04:47.960> really<00:04:48.260> a<00:04:48.290> chicken

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
that's why it's not really a chicken

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.770 
that's why it's not really a chicken
meal<00:04:49.100> that's<00:04:49.640> a<00:04:49.700> popcorn<00:04:49.910> chicken<00:04:50.270> meal<00:04:50.540> and

meal that's a popcorn chicken meal and
maybe<00:04:50.930> that's<00:04:51.140> why<00:04:51.290> they<00:04:51.440> didn't<00:04:51.680> go<00:04:51.800> the

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
maybe that's why they didn't go the

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.000 
maybe that's why they didn't go the
marinara<00:04:52.370> the<00:04:53.240> parmesan<00:04:53.780> chicken<00:04:54.530> parmesan
