00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
computer's reliability and I was this

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.840 
computer's reliability and I was this
program<00:01:56.009> was<00:01:56.159> definitely<00:01:56.549> not<00:01:56.670> going<00:01:56.790> to

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
program was definitely not going to

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.580

is not in motion it will start a timer
of<00:02:32.120> let's<00:02:33.120> see<00:02:33.330> we've<00:02:33.660> got<00:02:33.690> one<00:02:34.080> minute<00:02:34.410> and

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
of let's see we've got one minute and

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.290 
of let's see we've got one minute and
every<00:02:35.640> minute<00:02:36.060> of<00:02:37.519> not<00:02:38.519> doing<00:02:38.730> anything<00:02:39.060> on

every minute of not doing anything on
this<00:02:39.390> computer<00:02:39.660> it<00:02:40.110> will<00:02:40.349> are<00:02:40.769> on<00:02:41.280> this

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
this computer it will are on this

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.940 
this computer it will are on this
program<00:02:41.940> it<00:02:42.780> will<00:02:43.019> auto<00:02:43.200> save<00:02:44.030> so<00:02:45.350> when<00:02:46.350> I<00:02:46.590> stop

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
program it will auto save so when I stop

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.309
