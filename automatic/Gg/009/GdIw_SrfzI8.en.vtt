00:00:01.759 --> 00:00:04.450
 We were spreading out to this genre and were recruiting 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:05.840
 Burned down 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.899
 According to the training method 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:10.009
 And only one point 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:14.119
 It is the fifth by continuing going on such as technical schools 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:15.980
 As the second time 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.980
 Talk about regular failures 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:22.730
 I said that I wanted to do it 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.090
 Custody suddenly becomes more frequent 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.869
 Preparation after a long time 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:31.710
 There are many mistakes 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.710
 There is a good thing 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.980
 Any training 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.980
 It's time to make it easy to fail 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.210
 Investigating the cause 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.400
 Besides 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.650
 I think it's good 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.450
 I will consider the station staff 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.450
 Broadly divided into 13 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.970
 The whole year of 1998 fails 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.970
 First of all 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.560
 Worked for parasitology 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.730
 come 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.730
 And the second time 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.130
 I 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.650
 It is change of environment 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.650
 And the third 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.170
 Management's response is the focus 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.190
 And eight years 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.680
 http heroine 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.680
 And last 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.380
 It is conceivable to say 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.360
 This is the first time buying yen by growth 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.230
 Though 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.740
 If it can be said that won 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.560
 Matched 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.560
 But line up 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:58.650
 This book was 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.290
 Because it depends on this acquisition, there is a possibility of failure 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.390
 There is 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.960
 I paid attention for twenty-eight years 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.529
 This is right 

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:12.229
 It is not limited to people who use the internet 

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:15.219
 The place is a bit expensive, as I was surprised 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:16.369
 waiting 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:19.369
 It was a thorny horse 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:24.019
 The proposal added a place to tell that the yen was broken in the fall 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.589
 There is hiroya 

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:29.479
 It is formal of this work 

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:31.019
 And 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.259
 Change of correspondence of Tokiwa-sama 

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:35.829
 Based on this 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:38.829
 When we failed, we discussed 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:44.419
 I can not stop it even if this training app succeeds 

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:46.119
 Up to 22nd 

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:50.559
 But because it is not seen even if it precedes all, 

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:53.779
 The joy of taking it there has been lost 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.119
 The 

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:58.129
 Next to psychological factors 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:59.529
 This is right 

00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:00.860
 Is failing 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.379
 It is a generic term 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:05.089
 When continuing from before the race 

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:07.049
 If you can see it 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.969
 I was interested in the first 18 minutes 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:13.859
 I think that the daily deposit is on my own 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:15.409
 I often do 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:19.019
 But I can not see at all that I was based on the investigation 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.019
 Want to to 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:26.999
 When entering into these services based on that 

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:30.249
 Training is here and I stand here to win the game against Taiwan 

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:33.389
 It was not 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:36.189
 Wrapped in this one point 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:38.779
 It is the cause of lowering by force 

00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:41.149
 If the cause is understood 

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:44.149
 Return to the previous state 

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:47.289
 Generally it will be 

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:48.579
 Let's take a peek 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:51.219
 And again from the beginning 

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:52.909
 Fit that 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:54.279
 Mistaken with beer 

00:03:54.279 --> 00:03:56.509
 According to the organizer, you 

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:59.549
 As we remember safely early 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.400
 I am wondering 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.259
 please look 

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:06.259
 Because Fujikawa has more 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:08.479
 please look 

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:12.529
 Next time is next to this About parking memory 

00:04:12.529 --> 00:04:14.349
 I want to tell you 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:17.840
 Then we go to the storefront and have bilateral talks 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:18.499
 It was a way
