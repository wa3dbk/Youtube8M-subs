00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
the half-cent great concept with the

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.860 
the half-cent great concept with the
inside<00:03:23.609> of<00:03:23.639> the<00:03:23.790> foamposite<00:03:23.970> going<00:03:24.510> over<00:03:24.720> here

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
inside of the foamposite going over here

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.690 
inside of the foamposite going over here
that's<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.379> part<00:03:25.590> that<00:03:25.620> they<00:03:25.799> took<00:03:25.980> and<00:03:26.579> then

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
that's the part that they took and then

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.890 
that's the part that they took and then
the<00:03:26.790> foamposite<00:03:26.970> material<00:03:27.599> all<00:03:27.720> the<00:03:27.750> way

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
the foamposite material all the way

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.449 
the foamposite material all the way
around<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.139> side<00:03:28.639> good<00:03:29.639> shoe<00:03:30.410> um<00:03:31.410> I<00:03:31.889> think

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
around the side good shoe um I think

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:33.830 
around the side good shoe um I think
they<00:03:32.730> did<00:03:32.879> a<00:03:32.910> great<00:03:33.060> job<00:03:33.090> with<00:03:33.329> these<00:03:33.540> the

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
they did a great job with these the

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.720 
they did a great job with these the
price<00:03:34.049> point<00:03:34.319> is<00:03:34.410> still<00:03:34.560> pretty<00:03:34.739> good<00:03:34.980> so

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
price point is still pretty good so

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:36.710 
price point is still pretty good so
that's<00:03:36.030> the

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
that's the

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.360 
that's the
so<00:03:37.720> the<00:03:37.900> surfer<00:03:38.260> foamposites<00:03:38.860> have<00:03:39.100> sense

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
so the surfer foamposites have sense

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.370 
so the surfer foamposites have sense
which<00:03:39.820> I<00:03:39.940> like<00:03:40.090> a<00:03:40.120> lot<00:03:40.210> I<00:03:40.570> really<00:03:40.840> missed<00:03:41.260> out

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
which I like a lot I really missed out
