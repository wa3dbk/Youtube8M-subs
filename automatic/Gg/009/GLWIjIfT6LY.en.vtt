suspension I never used to believe in

suspension I never used to believe in
this<00:00:35.550> kind<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:35.880> suspensions<00:00:36.480> but<00:00:37.440> now<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:37.829> know

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
this kind of suspensions but now I know

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:48.290 
this kind of suspensions but now I know
that<00:00:38.190> they<00:00:38.520> work

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.030 

the<00:00:49.300> specific<00:00:49.780> model<00:00:50.110> is<00:00:50.200> a<00:00:50.230> v8<00:00:50.800> diesel<00:00:51.280> TDI

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
the specific model is a v8 diesel TDI

the specific model is a v8 diesel TDI
which<00:00:54.040> again<00:00:54.430> I'm<00:00:54.700> very<00:00:55.330> big<00:00:55.570> on<00:00:55.720> diesels<00:00:56.290> and

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
which again I'm very big on diesels and

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.710 
which again I'm very big on diesels and
purely<00:00:57.489> because<00:00:57.700> of<00:00:57.879> the<00:00:58.090> power<00:00:58.329> and<00:00:58.629> the

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720 
purely because of the power and the

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.390 
purely because of the power and the
torque<00:00:58.890> especially<00:00:59.890> if<00:00:59.950> you're<00:01:00.040> gonna<00:01:00.220> be

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:00.400 
torque especially if you're gonna be

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
going off-road inside is part is all

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.109 
going off-road inside is part is all
sorts<00:01:03.879> of<00:01:03.940> controls<00:01:04.479> right<00:01:04.930> height<00:01:06.119> dampening

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
sorts of controls right height dampening

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:09.600 
sorts of controls right height dampening
in<00:01:07.360> terms<00:01:07.600> of<00:01:07.780> normal<00:01:08.259> sports<00:01:08.710> the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
in terms of normal sports the

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.100 
in terms of normal sports the
electronics<00:01:10.180> are<00:01:10.330> really<00:01:10.630> really<00:01:10.900> working

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
electronics are really really working

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:24.650 
electronics are really really working
and<00:01:11.500> I'm<00:01:11.590> impressed

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.180 

the<00:01:25.660> specific<00:01:26.170> model<00:01:26.530> is<00:01:26.650> equipped<00:01:27.070> with

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
the specific model is equipped with

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.750 
the specific model is equipped with
19-inch<00:01:28.170> Bridgestone<00:01:29.170> jewelers<00:01:29.620> so<00:01:30.550> it<00:01:30.640> is

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
19-inch Bridgestone jewelers so it is

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.240 
19-inch Bridgestone jewelers so it is
capable<00:01:31.240> of<00:01:31.390> going<00:01:31.600> off-road<00:01:32.170> though<00:01:32.950> they

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
capable of going off-road though they

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.570 
capable of going off-road though they
are<00:01:33.310> not<00:01:33.460> opera<00:01:33.820> tires<00:01:34.710> my<00:01:35.710> biggest<00:01:36.010> problem

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
are not opera tires my biggest problem

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.640 
are not opera tires my biggest problem
with<00:01:36.700> a<00:01:36.760> bigger<00:01:37.120> diameter<00:01:37.450> tire<00:01:38.080> is<00:01:38.440> that

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
with a bigger diameter tire is that

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.680 
with a bigger diameter tire is that
there<00:01:39.070> isn't<00:01:39.430> much<00:01:39.640> to<00:01:39.910> display<00:01:40.330> to<00:01:40.390> be

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
there isn't much to display to be

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.050 
there isn't much to display to be
running<00:01:40.990> on<00:01:41.110> 19<00:01:41.530> inches<00:01:41.910> visibility<00:01:42.910> on<00:01:43.030> the

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
running on 19 inches visibility on the

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.630 
running on 19 inches visibility on the
car<00:01:43.390> is<00:01:43.510> also<00:01:43.690> impressive<00:01:44.200> for<00:01:44.530> me<00:01:44.650> the

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
car is also impressive for me the

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.760 
car is also impressive for me the
turning<00:01:46.030> circle<00:01:46.240> was<00:01:46.540> another<00:01:46.810> thing<00:01:47.110> with

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
turning circle was another thing with

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.550 
turning circle was another thing with
other<00:01:48.040> cars<00:01:48.430> would<00:01:48.640> have<00:01:48.670> to<00:01:49.090> make<00:01:49.300> this<00:01:49.570> I

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
other cars would have to make this I

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.160 
other cars would have to make this I
think<00:01:50.740> about<00:01:51.190> three<00:01:51.520> turns<00:01:51.820> when<00:01:52.660> we<00:01:52.810> did<00:01:52.990> with

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
think about three turns when we did with

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:05.330 
think about three turns when we did with
one<00:01:53.380> turn<00:01:53.620> with<00:01:53.800> the<00:01:53.860> Torah

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.839 

because<00:02:06.340> it's<00:02:06.549> not<00:02:06.729> a<00:02:06.790> traditional<00:02:08.670> four<00:02:09.670> bar

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 
because it's not a traditional four bar

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.890 
because it's not a traditional four bar
for<00:02:10.950> where<00:02:11.950> there's<00:02:12.220> no<00:02:12.340> electronics<00:02:13.060> you<00:02:13.660> get

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
for where there's no electronics you get

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:14.729 
for where there's no electronics you get
two<00:02:14.020> obstacles

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
two obstacles

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.509 
two obstacles
and<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:16.239> computer<00:02:16.750> sort<00:02:17.019> of<00:02:17.080> things<00:02:17.950> as<00:02:18.160> to

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
and the computer sort of things as to

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.870 
and the computer sort of things as to
wait<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:18.940> put<00:02:18.970> power<00:02:19.480> to<00:02:19.810> which<00:02:19.989> tire<00:02:20.349> and<00:02:20.880> when

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
wait to put power to which tire and when

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.640 
wait to put power to which tire and when
it<00:02:21.970> does<00:02:22.180> eventually<00:02:22.360> decide<00:02:23.140> you<00:02:23.380> find

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
it does eventually decide you find

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.400 
it does eventually decide you find
yourself<00:02:24.010> leaping<00:02:24.640> forward<00:02:24.940> which<00:02:25.870> can<00:02:26.170> be<00:02:26.380> a

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
yourself leaping forward which can be a

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:39.140 
yourself leaping forward which can be a
bit<00:02:26.680> of<00:02:26.769> a<00:02:26.860> discomfort

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.360 

the<00:02:40.150> right<00:02:40.330> height<00:02:40.660> can<00:02:40.990> be<00:02:41.140> set<00:02:41.410> manually<00:02:41.920> or

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
the right height can be set manually or

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.970 
the right height can be set manually or
you<00:02:42.490> can<00:02:42.670> put<00:02:42.850> it<00:02:42.940> on<00:02:43.090> auto<00:02:43.300> going<00:02:44.170> up<00:02:44.290> a<00:02:44.440> hill

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.650 

breakover<00:02:48.980> is<00:02:49.190> amazing<00:02:49.700> I'm<00:02:50.480> actually

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
breakover is amazing I'm actually

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:58.930 
breakover is amazing I'm actually
impressed

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.730 

I<00:02:58.970> was<00:02:59.660> actually<00:02:59.840> surprised<00:03:00.440> at<00:03:00.590> the

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
I was actually surprised at the

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.380 
I was actually surprised at the
variability<00:03:01.100> Touareg<00:03:01.520> made<00:03:01.730> it<00:03:01.880> on<00:03:02.030> on<00:03:02.270> the

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
variability Touareg made it on on the

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.990 
variability Touareg made it on on the
obstacle<00:03:02.780> course<00:03:02.810> but<00:03:03.710> I<00:03:03.890> wasn't<00:03:04.400> surprised<00:03:04.820> I

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
obstacle course but I wasn't surprised I

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.750 
obstacle course but I wasn't surprised I
did<00:03:05.240> it<00:03:05.360> in<00:03:05.540> so<00:03:05.750> much<00:03:05.900> comfort<00:03:06.320> but<00:03:07.040> as<00:03:07.340> with
