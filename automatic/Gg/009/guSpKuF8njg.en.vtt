black and they go first

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.160 
black and they go first
we<00:00:53.250> flip<00:00:53.520> up<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.789> down<00:00:54.030> which<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.329> nice<00:00:54.539> this

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
we flip up and down which is nice this

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.069 
we flip up and down which is nice this
is<00:00:55.230> not<00:00:55.530> it's<00:00:56.250> like<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.399> label<00:00:56.910> on<00:00:57.090> here<00:00:57.360> well

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
is not it's like a label on here well

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.959 
is not it's like a label on here well
it's<00:00:58.199> pretty<00:00:58.350> neat<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.309> start<00:00:59.670> in<00:00:59.820> this

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
it's pretty neat so you start in this

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.910 
it's pretty neat so you start in this
position<00:01:00.600> here<00:01:00.809> black<00:01:01.109> would<00:01:01.289> go<00:01:01.410> first<00:01:01.739> and

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
position here black would go first and

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:09.080 
position here black would go first and
black<00:01:02.160> needs<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.550> capture<00:01:03.559> white<00:01:07.070> there<00:01:08.090> so

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
black needs to capture white there so

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.880 
black needs to capture white there so
now<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.299> white<00:01:09.570> would<00:01:09.750> go<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.710> white

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
now the white would go and the white

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.640 
now the white would go and the white
needs<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.250> capture<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:12.119> black<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.260> this

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
needs to capture a black and this

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.969 
needs to capture a black and this
continues<00:01:14.810> because<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.990> can<00:01:16.110> go<00:01:16.259> crossways

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
continues because you can go crossways

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.640 
continues because you can go crossways
sideways<00:01:17.670> so<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.509> more<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.930> get<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.110> put<00:01:19.409> down

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
sideways so the more you get to put down

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.850 
sideways so the more you get to put down
and<00:01:19.920> different<00:01:20.280> spots<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.750> better<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.409> of

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
and different spots the better and of

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.490 
and different spots the better and of
