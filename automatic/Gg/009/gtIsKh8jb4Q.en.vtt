00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
hunch and a lot I thought there was

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.350 
hunch and a lot I thought there was
enough<00:03:02.800> of<00:03:02.920> that<00:03:02.950> to<00:03:03.250> sticking<00:03:03.700> out<00:03:03.849> you<00:03:04.269> were

right<00:03:04.540> and<00:03:04.980> I<00:03:05.980> should<00:03:06.489> learn<00:03:06.970> to<00:03:07.030> shut<00:03:07.420> up<00:03:07.569> let

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
right and I should learn to shut up let

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.280 
right and I should learn to shut up let
them<00:03:08.110> figure<00:03:08.349> it<00:03:08.500> out<00:03:08.739> when<00:03:08.950> it's<00:03:09.130> this<00:03:09.340> close

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290

left hand side pocket Tony looking at

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.229 
left hand side pocket Tony looking at
now<00:03:40.690> and<00:03:41.650> what's<00:03:41.830> worrying<00:03:42.340> him<00:03:42.580> is<00:03:42.819> the<00:03:42.940> speed

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
now and what's worrying him is the speed

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.720 
now and what's worrying him is the speed
that<00:03:43.450> that<00:03:43.599> cue<00:03:43.840> ball<00:03:44.019> is<00:03:44.140> going<00:03:44.260> to<00:03:44.349> have<00:03:44.730> if

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
that that cue ball is going to have if

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.030 
that that cue ball is going to have if
he<00:03:46.060> does<00:03:46.239> take<00:03:46.510> that<00:03:46.540> on<00:03:46.840> to<00:03:46.989> the<00:03:47.049> side<00:03:47.319> and<00:03:47.680> for

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
he does take that on to the side and for

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.890 
he does take that on to the side and for
that<00:03:48.099> very<00:03:48.160> reason<00:03:48.400> he's<00:03:49.299> taking<00:03:49.510> a<00:03:49.720> more

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
that very reason he's taking a more

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.039 
that very reason he's taking a more
difficult<00:03:50.220> shot<00:03:51.220> on<00:03:51.459> to<00:03:51.670> the<00:03:51.760> corner<00:03:52.209> top<00:03:52.480> left

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
difficult shot on to the corner top left

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.580 
difficult shot on to the corner top left
as<00:03:53.290> we<00:03:53.470> look<00:03:53.730> good<00:03:54.730> choice<00:03:55.030> because<00:03:55.410> there<00:03:56.410> are

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
as we look good choice because there are

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.590 
as we look good choice because there are
times<00:03:56.920> where<00:03:57.280> you<00:03:57.310> could<00:03:57.700> shoot<00:03:57.880> the<00:03:58.090> easier

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
times where you could shoot the easier

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.280 
times where you could shoot the easier
shot<00:03:59.079> and<00:03:59.609> the<00:04:00.609> cue<00:04:00.820> ball<00:04:00.850> flies<00:04:01.420> and<00:04:01.930> you<00:04:02.109> can

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
shot and the cue ball flies and you can

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.050 
shot and the cue ball flies and you can
shoot<00:04:02.470> the<00:04:02.500> tougher<00:04:03.010> shot<00:04:03.250> and<00:04:03.519> control<00:04:03.910> the

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
shoot the tougher shot and control the

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.610 
shoot the tougher shot and control the
cue<00:04:04.239> ball<00:04:04.299> a<00:04:04.480> little<00:04:04.660> better<00:04:04.959> and<00:04:05.140> that's<00:04:05.290> what

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
cue ball a little better and that's what

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.160 
cue ball a little better and that's what
he<00:04:05.769> decided<00:04:06.190> shoots<00:04:07.150> a<00:04:07.269> tougher<00:04:07.630> shot<00:04:07.840> and<00:04:08.049> get

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
he decided shoots a tougher shot and get

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:23.190 
he decided shoots a tougher shot and get
position<00:04:08.680> for<00:04:08.920> sure

pretty good pretty good how straight did
he<00:04:36.760> get<00:04:36.990> he<00:04:37.990> has<00:04:38.110> an<00:04:38.230> angle<00:04:38.560> to<00:04:38.590> draw<00:04:38.920> it<00:04:38.980> to<00:04:39.550> the

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
he get he has an angle to draw it to the

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.020 
he get he has an angle to draw it to the
6th<00:04:40.180> doesn't<00:04:40.630> he

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.010 

well<00:04:45.030> he<00:04:45.270> didn't<00:04:45.449> want<00:04:45.570> to<00:04:45.630> go<00:04:45.750> too<00:04:45.810> far

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
well he didn't want to go too far

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.860 
well he didn't want to go too far
because<00:04:46.290> the<00:04:47.040> closer<00:04:47.400> he<00:04:47.699> gets<00:04:47.880> to<00:04:48.060> the<00:04:48.270> sixth

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
because the closer he gets to the sixth

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.200 
because the closer he gets to the sixth
the<00:04:49.350> tougher<00:04:49.740> the<00:04:49.860> shadow<00:04:50.130> be<00:04:50.400> so<00:04:50.669> I<00:04:50.699> think<00:04:50.880> he

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
the tougher the shadow be so I think he

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.800 
the tougher the shadow be so I think he
might<00:04:51.389> just<00:04:51.660> cinch<00:04:51.930> and<00:04:52.139> take<00:04:52.380> the<00:04:52.590> shot<00:04:53.810> he

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
might just cinch and take the shot he

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:03.830 
might just cinch and take the shot he
did<00:04:55.020> it<00:04:55.139> perfect<00:05:01.850> he's<00:05:02.850> looking<00:05:03.150> very<00:05:03.180> focused

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840

to very composed and get a mind that's

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.740 
to very composed and get a mind that's
in<00:05:08.010> control<00:05:08.550> of<00:05:08.580> his<00:05:08.850> nerve<00:05:09.150> the<00:05:09.449> way<00:05:09.570> that

me<00:05:52.830> anyway<00:05:52.860> it<00:05:53.580> was<00:05:54.330> a<00:05:54.360> little<00:05:54.900> better<00:05:55.080> result

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
me anyway it was a little better result

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.250 
me anyway it was a little better result
