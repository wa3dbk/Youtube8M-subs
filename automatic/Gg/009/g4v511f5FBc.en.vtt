we<00:00:09.269> provide<00:00:10.639> agent-based<00:00:11.639> modeling

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
we provide agent-based modeling

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.570 
we provide agent-based modeling
consulting<00:00:12.690> services<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.440> we<00:00:14.370> do

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
consulting services and we do

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.710 
consulting services and we do
agent-based<00:00:15.179> modeling<00:00:15.780> tools<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.440> in<00:00:16.590> this

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
agent-based modeling tools and in this

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.800 
agent-based modeling tools and in this
screencast<00:00:18.720> I'm<00:00:19.260> going<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.560> describe<00:00:20.810> the

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
screencast I'm going to describe the

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.779 
screencast I'm going to describe the
architecture<00:00:22.500> for<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.039> agent<00:00:23.400> modeling

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
architecture for the agent modeling

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.750 
architecture for the agent modeling
platform<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.480> we'll<00:00:24.750> start<00:00:25.050> out<00:00:25.369> looking<00:00:26.369> at

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
platform and we'll start out looking at

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.580 
platform and we'll start out looking at
the<00:00:27.000> age<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.210> execution<00:00:27.869> framework<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.439> age

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
the age and execution framework and age

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.900 
the age and execution framework and age
and<00:00:28.769> graphics<00:00:29.220> frameworks

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.210 

so<00:00:32.509> let's<00:00:32.720> go<00:00:32.870> into<00:00:32.930> the<00:00:33.380> architecture<00:00:33.800> itself

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
so let's go into the architecture itself

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.380 
so let's go into the architecture itself
and<00:00:34.730> as<00:00:35.690> I<00:00:36.470> mentioned<00:00:36.680> there<00:00:37.280> are<00:00:37.340> four<00:00:38.150> main

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
and as I mentioned there are four main

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.030 
and as I mentioned there are four main
components<00:00:38.570> here<00:00:39.170> there's<00:00:39.410> the<00:00:39.559> modeling

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
components here there's the modeling

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.040 
components here there's the modeling
framework<00:00:40.220> the<00:00:40.910> execution<00:00:41.540> framework<00:00:41.930> the

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
framework the execution framework the

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.840 
framework the execution framework the
graphics<00:00:42.470> framework<00:00:42.860> and<00:00:43.040> then<00:00:43.190> this<00:00:43.670> other

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
graphics framework and then this other

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.720 
graphics framework and then this other
piece<00:00:44.180> called<00:00:44.750> escape<00:00:45.040> so<00:00:46.090> we<00:00:47.090> start<00:00:47.390> out<00:00:47.570> here

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
piece called escape so we start out here

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.460 
piece called escape so we start out here
we'll<00:00:49.730> start<00:00:49.970> out<00:00:50.090> with<00:00:50.239> the<00:00:50.300> agent<00:00:50.840> execution

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.470 
we'll start out with the agent execution

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.220 
we'll start out with the agent execution
framework<00:00:51.890> and<00:00:52.420> what<00:00:53.420> this<00:00:53.570> provides<00:00:54.019> is<00:00:54.199> a

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
framework and what this provides is a

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.549 
framework and what this provides is a
set<00:00:54.500> of<00:00:54.590> tools<00:00:54.830> that<00:00:55.010> could<00:00:55.309> actually<00:00:55.489> be

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
set of tools that could actually be

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.830 
set of tools that could actually be
quite<00:00:57.559> useful<00:00:57.800> even<00:00:58.640> outside<00:00:58.970> of<00:00:59.239> the<00:00:59.480> agent

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
quite useful even outside of the agent

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.250 
quite useful even outside of the agent
modeling<00:01:00.290> environment<00:01:00.940> it<00:01:01.960> provides<00:01:02.960> a<00:01:03.110> way

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
modeling environment it provides a way

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.749 
modeling environment it provides a way
it<00:01:04.000> provides<00:01:05.000> a<00:01:05.149> set<00:01:05.330> of<00:01:05.420> tools<00:01:05.660> that<00:01:06.850> on<00:01:08.680> at

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
environment so for example if you wanted

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.710 
environment so for example if you wanted
to<00:01:33.649> write<00:01:35.259> some<00:01:36.259> kind<00:01:36.470> of<00:01:36.590> say<00:01:37.250> linear

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
to write some kind of say linear

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.210 
to write some kind of say linear
equation<00:01:38.720> solver<00:01:39.229> or<00:01:39.349> something<00:01:39.709> you<00:01:40.069> could

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
equation solver or something you could

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.790 
equation solver or something you could
plug<00:01:40.459> it<00:01:40.640> well<00:01:41.119> something<00:01:41.720> that<00:01:41.869> took<00:01:42.050> a<00:01:42.259> long

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
plug it well something that took a long

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.859 
plug it well something that took a long
time<00:01:42.860> to<00:01:43.160> compute<00:01:43.700> you<00:01:44.209> could<00:01:44.360> plug<00:01:44.569> it<00:01:44.720> into

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
time to compute you could plug it into

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.169 
time to compute you could plug it into
this<00:01:45.080> environment<00:01:45.289> and<00:01:46.009> you<00:01:46.580> could<00:01:46.759> set<00:01:46.970> up<00:01:47.090> a

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:47.179 
this environment and you could set up a

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:48.999 
this environment and you could set up a
job<00:01:47.420> for<00:01:47.660> in<00:01:47.750> that<00:01:47.869> job<00:01:48.080> would<00:01:48.349> easily<00:01:48.649> be

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
job for in that job would easily be

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.570 
job for in that job would easily be
controllable<00:01:49.700> and<00:01:49.899> and<00:01:50.899> using<00:01:51.709> a<00:01:51.920> GF<00:01:52.280> you<00:01:52.429> can

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
controllable and and using a GF you can

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.279 
controllable and and using a GF you can
do<00:01:52.670> visualizations<00:01:53.240> of<00:01:53.599> it<00:01:53.750> and<00:01:53.899> so<00:01:54.080> on<00:01:54.250> so

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
do visualizations of it and so on so

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:58.960 
do visualizations of it and so on so
these<00:01:57.289> are<00:01:57.470> the<00:01:57.500> different<00:01:57.649> pieces<00:01:57.979> that<00:01:58.399> axf

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
these are the different pieces that axf

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.339 
these are the different pieces that axf
provides<00:02:00.220> so<00:02:01.450> very<00:02:02.450> important<00:02:03.050> that<00:02:03.170> it

00:02:03.339 --> 00:02:03.349 
provides so very important that it

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:05.559 
provides so very important that it
supports<00:02:03.800> collaborations<00:02:04.610> between<00:02:04.700> agents

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:05.569 
supports collaborations between agents

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:06.930 
supports collaborations between agents
and<00:02:05.690> so<00:02:05.840> on<00:02:05.929> so<00:02:06.050> you<00:02:06.110> can<00:02:06.259> really<00:02:06.380> define<00:02:06.590> the

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
and so on so you can really define the

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.570 
and so on so you can really define the
high-level<00:02:07.940> agent<00:02:08.450> structure<00:02:08.959> on<00:02:09.220> and<00:02:10.220> then

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
high-level agent structure on and then

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.430 
high-level agent structure on and then
again<00:02:10.849> as<00:02:11.120> I<00:02:11.300> said<00:02:11.330> lifecycle<00:02:12.110> you<00:02:12.230> when<00:02:12.380> the

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
again as I said lifecycle you when the

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.229 
again as I said lifecycle you when the
model<00:02:12.739> stops<00:02:13.010> and<00:02:13.250> starts<00:02:13.459> when<00:02:13.760> it<00:02:13.880> iterates

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
model stops and starts when it iterates

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:15.940 
model stops and starts when it iterates
all<00:02:14.660> of<00:02:14.810> these<00:02:14.930> different<00:02:15.080> pieces<00:02:15.440> and<00:02:15.860> the

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
all of these different pieces and the

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.740 
all of these different pieces and the
reporting<00:02:16.430> of<00:02:16.520> those<00:02:16.730> to<00:02:16.940> you<00:02:17.060> I<00:02:17.120> in<00:02:17.630> a

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
reporting of those to you I in a

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.860 
reporting of those to you I in a
consistent<00:02:18.080> way<00:02:18.349> and<00:02:18.680> so<00:02:18.860> on<00:02:19.010> and<00:02:19.940> then<00:02:20.390> there

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
consistent way and so on and then there

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.510 
consistent way and so on and then there
are<00:02:20.900> a<00:02:21.050> bunch<00:02:21.230> of<00:02:21.380> extensions<00:02:22.010> that<00:02:22.280> come

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
are a bunch of extensions that come

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.190 
are a bunch of extensions that come
through<00:02:22.550> part<00:02:23.300> of<00:02:23.390> li<00:02:23.510> through<00:02:23.690> the<00:02:23.810> modeling

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
through part of li through the modeling

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.199 
through part of li through the modeling
environment<00:02:24.349> that<00:02:25.250> handle<00:02:25.730> things<00:02:26.030> like

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
environment that handle things like

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.380 
environment that handle things like
model<00:02:27.200> on<00:02:27.860> setting<00:02:28.670> of<00:02:28.730> parameters<00:02:29.150> for

model on setting of parameters for
models<00:02:29.780> and<00:02:29.959> all<00:02:30.050> of<00:02:30.140> those<00:02:30.290> kinds<00:02:30.650> of<00:02:30.709> things

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
models and all of those kinds of things

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.780 
models and all of those kinds of things
okay<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:33.410> so<00:02:33.830> the<00:02:33.950> next<00:02:34.099> piece<00:02:34.340> is<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.640> age

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
okay and so the next piece is the age

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.000 
okay and so the next piece is the age
and<00:02:34.970> graphics<00:02:35.420> framework<00:02:35.840> and<00:02:35.989> that<00:02:36.709> may<00:02:36.950> be

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
and graphics framework and that may be

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.750 
and graphics framework and that may be
even<00:02:37.370> more<00:02:37.550> interesting<00:02:38.440> as<00:02:39.440> it<00:02:39.770> is<00:02:39.980> a<00:02:40.010> general

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
even more interesting as it is a general

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.740 
even more interesting as it is a general
tool<00:02:41.890> because<00:02:42.890> what<00:02:43.730> we're<00:02:43.880> providing<00:02:44.150> here

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
tool because what we're providing here

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:45.200 
tool because what we're providing here
is

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
is

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.020 
is
high-level<00:02:45.870> rapping<00:02:46.500> for<00:02:47.460> a<00:02:47.520> lot<00:02:47.760> of<00:02:47.940> the

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
high-level rapping for a lot of the

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.640 
high-level rapping for a lot of the
kinds<00:02:48.390> of<00:02:49.040> different<00:02:50.330> tools<00:02:51.330> that<00:02:51.630> people<00:02:51.810> use

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
kinds of different tools that people use

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.610 
kinds of different tools that people use
for<00:02:53.070> visualization<00:02:53.490> within<00:02:54.480> eclipse<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:55.170> so

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
for visualization within eclipse and so

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.440 
for visualization within eclipse and so
of<00:02:55.710> course<00:02:55.890> that<00:02:56.100> includes<00:02:56.250> duty<00:02:56.670> 3d<00:02:57.030> charts

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
of course that includes duty 3d charts

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.440 
of course that includes duty 3d charts
and<00:02:57.630> graphs<00:02:58.400> but<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.520> idea<00:02:59.790> is<00:02:59.850> that<00:02:59.940> through

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
and graphs but the idea is that through

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.620 
and graphs but the idea is that through
very<00:03:01.230> simple<00:03:01.650> providers<00:03:02.220> say<00:03:02.430> providing<00:03:03.000> in<00:03:03.240> a

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
very simple providers say providing in a

provider for your various model entities

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.650 
provider for your various model entities
and<00:03:09.630> then<00:03:10.350> say<00:03:11.340> in<00:03:11.520> the<00:03:11.610> 3d<00:03:11.970> case<00:03:12.240> a<00:03:12.270> shape

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.990 
and then say in the 3d case a shape
provider<00:03:13.050> and<00:03:13.290> so<00:03:13.470> on<00:03:13.650> and<00:03:13.830> just<00:03:14.400> plugging

those into an extension you should then

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.460 
those into an extension you should then
be<00:03:17.220> able<00:03:17.400> to<00:03:17.580> get<00:03:17.880> nice<00:03:18.270> 2d<00:03:18.720> and<00:03:18.870> 3d<00:03:18.900> views

2d<00:03:26.460> and<00:03:26.730> someone<00:03:27.360> in<00:03:27.570> 3d<00:03:27.990> and<00:03:28.050> so<00:03:28.290> on<00:03:29.180> um<00:03:30.950> but

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
2d and someone in 3d and so on um but

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.400 
2d and someone in 3d and so on um but
this<00:03:32.610> infrastructure<00:03:32.970> is<00:03:33.420> tightly<00:03:33.720> woven<00:03:34.050> in

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
this infrastructure is tightly woven in

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.670 
this infrastructure is tightly woven in
with<00:03:34.590> all<00:03:34.800> of<00:03:34.950> the<00:03:35.040> existing<00:03:35.520> eclipse<00:03:35.940> on<00:03:36.680> bits

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
with all of the existing eclipse on bits

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.790 
with all of the existing eclipse on bits
so<00:03:39.230> the<00:03:40.230> edit<00:03:40.710> the<00:03:41.100> other<00:03:41.250> part<00:03:41.640> um<00:03:42.620> and<00:03:43.620> all

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
so the edit the other part um and all

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.260 
so the edit the other part um and all
the<00:03:44.040> GF<00:03:44.430> edit<00:03:44.760> part<00:03:45.060> stuff<00:03:45.390> is<00:03:45.570> is<00:03:46.020> is<00:03:47.270> tightly

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
the GF edit part stuff is is is tightly

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.550 
the GF edit part stuff is is is tightly
integrated<00:03:49.020> and<00:03:49.250> um<00:03:51.020> it'll<00:03:52.020> be<00:03:52.140> very<00:03:52.350> familiar

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
integrated and um it'll be very familiar

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.710 
integrated and um it'll be very familiar
to<00:03:53.010> anybody<00:03:53.190> who's<00:03:53.520> used<00:03:53.790> any<00:03:54.030> of<00:03:54.150> those<00:03:54.210> tools

to anybody who's used any of those tools
on<00:03:55.130> we're<00:03:56.130> also<00:03:56.280> working<00:03:56.580> with<00:03:58.160> supporting

dynamic real-time charting using the
birth<00:04:03.600> environment<00:04:06.800> then<00:04:07.800> we<00:04:07.950> have<00:04:08.130> escaped

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
birth environment then we have escaped

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.370 
birth environment then we have escaped
and<00:04:11.180> escapes<00:04:12.180> an<00:04:12.360> example<00:04:12.840> of<00:04:12.900> how<00:04:13.050> we<00:04:13.110> use

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
and escapes an example of how we use

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.500 
and escapes an example of how we use
these<00:04:13.590> different<00:04:13.980> tools<00:04:14.190> together<00:04:14.640> the

these different tools together the

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.060 
these different tools together the
really<00:04:15.810> important<00:04:16.200> thing<00:04:16.440> about<00:04:16.560> the<00:04:16.770> design

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
really important thing about the design

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.030 
really important thing about the design
of<00:04:17.100> the<00:04:17.340> XF<00:04:17.700> in<00:04:17.820> EGF<00:04:18.299> is<00:04:18.510> that<00:04:19.200> they're<00:04:19.770> very

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
of the XF in EGF is that they're very

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.350 
of the XF in EGF is that they're very
lightweight<00:04:20.700> and<00:04:21.150> they're<00:04:21.570> focused<00:04:21.989> on<00:04:22.170> on

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
lightweight and they're focused on on

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.600 
lightweight and they're focused on on
providing<00:04:24.360> interfaces<00:04:24.990> so<00:04:25.200> for<00:04:25.710> example<00:04:25.770> axf

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
providing interfaces so for example axf

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.490 
providing interfaces so for example axf
itself<00:04:27.060> does<00:04:27.300> not<00:04:27.330> have<00:04:27.810> an<00:04:27.900> agent-based

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
model scheduling engine it just provides

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.750 
model scheduling engine it just provides
an<00:04:32.190> i<00:04:32.430> engine<00:04:33.650> interface<00:04:34.650> that<00:04:35.460> then

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
an i engine interface that then

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.840 
an i engine interface that then
scheduling<00:04:36.720> engines<00:04:37.020> can<00:04:37.290> adapt<00:04:38.220> to<00:04:38.490> an<00:04:38.700> a

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570

with whatever other visualizations they

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.790 
with whatever other visualizations they

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
want the important thing

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.730 
want the important thing
here<00:04:58.979> is<00:04:59.220> that<00:04:59.750> we<00:05:00.750> can<00:05:00.990> look<00:05:01.110> at<00:05:01.229> the<00:05:01.349> runtime

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
here is that we can look at the runtime

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.969 
here is that we can look at the runtime
is<00:05:01.949> sort<00:05:02.129> of<00:05:02.159> a<00:05:02.280> bus<00:05:02.520> here<00:05:02.909> and<00:05:03.830> there<00:05:04.830> are

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
is sort of a bus here and there are

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:08.390 
is sort of a bus here and there are

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:12.449 
between ax up and a GF and a skate a GF

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:16.180 
between ax up and a GF and a skate a GF
does<00:05:12.690> have<00:05:12.870> some<00:05:13.050> ancef<00:05:13.639> dependencies<00:05:14.639> for

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
does have some ancef dependencies for

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.020 
does have some ancef dependencies for
problem<00:05:17.190> reasons<00:05:17.460> that<00:05:17.550> you<00:05:17.669> probably<00:05:17.819> be

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
problem reasons that you probably be

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.080 
problem reasons that you probably be
pretty<00:05:18.210> clear<00:05:19.039> so<00:05:20.039> all<00:05:20.310> of<00:05:20.340> the<00:05:20.610> stuff<00:05:20.879> has

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
pretty clear so all of the stuff has

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.249 
pretty clear so all of the stuff has
adapted<00:05:22.250> the<00:05:23.250> a<00:05:23.280> scape<00:05:23.819> there<00:05:24.569> is<00:05:24.690> there's<00:05:24.990> one

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:25.259 
adapted the a scape there is there's one

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:29.320 
adapted the a scape there is there's one
plugin<00:05:25.560> that's<00:05:26.720> escape<00:05:27.720> escape<00:05:28.259> which

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
plugin that's escape escape which

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.930 
plugin that's escape escape which
provides<00:05:30.330> the<00:05:30.479> glue<00:05:30.810> between<00:05:31.879> escaping<00:05:32.879> the

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
provides the glue between escaping the

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.969 
provides the glue between escaping the
ax<00:05:33.210> stuff<00:05:33.389> and<00:05:33.539> a<00:05:33.599> GF<00:05:33.870> components<00:05:34.409> and<00:05:34.560> then

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
ax stuff and a GF components and then

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:37.459 
ax stuff and a GF components and then
that<00:05:35.430> all<00:05:35.669> happens<00:05:36.270> at<00:05:36.479> runtime<00:05:36.780> so<00:05:37.319> these

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:37.469 
that all happens at runtime so these

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:38.959 
that all happens at runtime so these
different<00:05:37.889> api's<00:05:38.250> don't<00:05:38.550> have<00:05:38.729> to<00:05:38.849> know

00:05:38.959 --> 00:05:38.969 
different api's don't have to know

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:41.149 
different api's don't have to know
anything<00:05:39.120> about<00:05:39.419> each<00:05:39.750> other<00:05:39.990> then<00:05:40.830> finally

00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:41.159 
anything about each other then finally

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:43.629 
anything about each other then finally
as<00:05:41.430> well<00:05:41.610> see<00:05:41.759> the<00:05:41.909> agent<00:05:42.210> modeling<00:05:42.659> framework

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:43.639 
as well see the agent modeling framework

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:47.059 
as well see the agent modeling framework
actually<00:05:44.639> generates<00:05:45.360> code<00:05:45.719> into<00:05:46.469> the<00:05:46.500> escape

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:47.069 
actually generates code into the escape

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:49.399 
actually generates code into the escape
environment<00:05:47.759> so<00:05:47.969> you<00:05:48.060> can<00:05:48.330> use<00:05:48.509> a<00:05:48.539> MF<00:05:48.990> models

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:49.409 
environment so you can use a MF models

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:54.200 
environment so you can use a MF models
to<00:05:49.560> run<00:05:49.740> in<00:05:49.889> eastgate<00:05:52.039> so<00:05:53.039> let's<00:05:53.729> look<00:05:53.909> at<00:05:54.060> how

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
to run in eastgate so let's look at how

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:55.689 
to run in eastgate so let's look at how
all<00:05:54.449> these<00:05:54.629> different<00:05:54.870> pieces<00:05:55.110> fit<00:05:55.500> together

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:55.699 
all these different pieces fit together

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:58.339 
all these different pieces fit together
it<00:05:56.699> looks<00:05:56.969> quite<00:05:57.210> complex<00:05:57.690> but<00:05:57.870> again<00:05:58.169> in<00:05:58.259> the

00:05:58.339 --> 00:05:58.349 
it looks quite complex but again in the

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:00.559 
it looks quite complex but again in the
middle<00:05:58.469> here<00:05:58.770> we<00:05:58.949> have<00:05:59.159> just<00:06:00.150> a<00:06:00.270> set<00:06:00.479> of

00:06:00.559 --> 00:06:00.569 
middle here we have just a set of

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:02.779 
middle here we have just a set of
adapters<00:06:01.110> and<00:06:01.349> the<00:06:01.710> idea<00:06:02.039> here<00:06:02.340> is<00:06:02.370> that<00:06:02.520> we

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:02.789 
adapters and the idea here is that we

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:04.490 
adapters and the idea here is that we
can<00:06:02.969> support<00:06:03.389> a<00:06:03.509> whole<00:06:03.659> ecosystem<00:06:03.870> of

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
can support a whole ecosystem of

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.839 
can support a whole ecosystem of
agent-based<00:06:04.860> modeling<00:06:05.460> tools<00:06:05.819> so<00:06:06.630> um<00:06:07.849> for

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:08.849 
agent-based modeling tools so um for

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:11.809 
agent-based modeling tools so um for
example<00:06:09.210> we<00:06:09.330> can<00:06:09.479> do<00:06:10.219> we<00:06:11.219> can<00:06:11.250> plug<00:06:11.580> in<00:06:11.699> some

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:11.819 
example we can do we can plug in some

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:13.610 
example we can do we can plug in some
validation<00:06:12.360> and<00:06:12.479> verification<00:06:12.659> tools<00:06:13.469> from

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620 
validation and verification tools from

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.700 
validation and verification tools from
am<00:06:13.919> FX<00:06:14.630> we've<00:06:15.630> been<00:06:15.779> talking<00:06:16.289> to<00:06:16.319> some<00:06:16.469> folks

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.710 
am FX we've been talking to some folks

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.189 
am FX we've been talking to some folks
at<00:06:16.889> Mason<00:06:17.310> about<00:06:17.610> taking<00:06:18.150> they've<00:06:18.960> got<00:06:19.169> a

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:19.199 
at Mason about taking they've got a

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:20.959 
at Mason about taking they've got a
really<00:06:19.380> neat<00:06:19.680> agent-based<00:06:20.130> modeling<00:06:20.729> tool

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:20.969 
really neat agent-based modeling tool

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:24.890 
really neat agent-based modeling tool
that's<00:06:21.300> that's<00:06:22.039> focused<00:06:23.039> on<00:06:23.190> on<00:06:23.520> on<00:06:24.000> high

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:24.900 
that's that's focused on on on high

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.249 
that's that's focused on on on high
performance<00:06:24.960> and<00:06:26.000> so<00:06:27.000> they<00:06:27.870> could<00:06:28.050> take<00:06:28.199> their

00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:28.259 
performance and so they could take their

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:30.350 
performance and so they could take their
scheduler<00:06:28.949> and<00:06:28.979> implement<00:06:29.729> the<00:06:29.819> I<00:06:29.849> engine

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
scheduler and implement the I engine

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.450 
scheduler and implement the I engine
interface<00:06:30.599> and<00:06:31.080> so<00:06:31.259> on<00:06:31.409> and<00:06:31.620> then<00:06:32.069> provide

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460 
interface and so on and then provide

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.339 
interface and so on and then provide
that<00:06:32.699> or<00:06:33.000> they<00:06:33.330> could<00:06:33.389> do<00:06:33.569> the<00:06:33.659> visualization

00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:34.349 
that or they could do the visualization

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:40.659 
that or they could do the visualization
parts<00:06:34.710> or<00:06:34.889> whatever<00:06:35.520> but<00:06:36.090> the<00:06:37.849> mem<00:06:38.849> is<00:06:39.000> a<00:06:39.150> tool

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:40.669 
parts or whatever but the mem is a tool

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:45.559 
parts or whatever but the mem is a tool
by<00:06:41.669> a<00:06:42.740> European<00:06:43.740> group<00:06:43.979> that<00:06:44.550> has<00:06:45.120> really

00:06:45.559 --> 00:06:45.569 
by a European group that has really

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:47.990 
by a European group that has really
really<00:06:45.870> amazing<00:06:46.819> capabilities<00:06:47.819> for

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 
really amazing capabilities for

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.480 
really amazing capabilities for
parameter<00:06:48.479> model<00:06:48.750> parameterization<00:06:49.680> so

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:50.490 
parameter model parameterization so

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:54.619 
parameter model parameterization so
imagine<00:06:51.479> that<00:06:51.629> you<00:06:51.810> you<00:06:52.560> wanted<00:06:52.979> to<00:06:53.569> take<00:06:54.569> a

00:06:54.619 --> 00:06:54.629 
imagine that you you wanted to take a

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:56.540 
imagine that you you wanted to take a
model<00:06:55.080> that<00:06:55.110> you<00:06:55.289> developed<00:06:55.740> in<00:06:55.860> Mason<00:06:56.310> and

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:56.550 
model that you developed in Mason and

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.850 
model that you developed in Mason and
then<00:06:56.909> do<00:06:57.210> extensive<00:06:57.750> parameterization<00:06:58.590> based

00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:58.860 
then do extensive parameterization based

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.709 
then do extensive parameterization based
on<00:06:59.039> that<00:06:59.190> well<00:06:59.669> you<00:06:59.789> could<00:06:59.940> do<00:07:00.150> that<00:07:00.330> and<00:07:00.599> the

00:07:00.709 --> 00:07:00.719 
on that well you could do that and the

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:02.029 
on that well you could do that and the
two<00:07:00.870> different<00:07:01.110> pieces<00:07:01.289> wouldn't<00:07:01.770> have<00:07:01.889> to

00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:02.039 
two different pieces wouldn't have to
