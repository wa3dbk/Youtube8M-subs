00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
next question is from Tom Atleti that

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.580 
next question is from Tom Atleti that
and<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.730> question<00:01:14.910> is<00:01:15.150> is<00:01:15.330> multiplayer<00:01:16.290> in

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
and the question is is multiplayer in

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.150 
and the question is is multiplayer in
one<00:01:17.010> hundred<00:01:17.310> percent<00:01:17.550> of<00:01:17.940> the<00:01:18.030> game<00:01:18.980> in<00:01:19.980> a

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
one hundred percent of the game in a

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.700 
one hundred percent of the game in a
sense<00:01:20.400> yes<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:20.940> mean<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.450> game<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.140> structures

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
sense yes I mean the game is structures

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.480 
sense yes I mean the game is structures
so<00:01:22.920> we<00:01:23.040> have<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.430> pv<00:01:24.000> PvE<00:01:24.630> area<00:01:25.260> and<00:01:25.530> then<00:01:26.400> you

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
so we have a pv PvE area and then you

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.940 
so we have a pv PvE area and then you
can<00:01:26.640> seamlessly<00:01:26.850> move<00:01:27.570> into<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.050> PvP<00:01:28.710> area

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
can seamlessly move into the PvP area

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.070 
can seamlessly move into the PvP area
but<00:01:29.400> in<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.640> PvP<00:01:30.060> area<00:01:30.360> it's<00:01:30.780> it's

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
but in the PvP area it's it's

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.020 
but in the PvP area it's it's
cooperative<00:01:31.800> so<00:01:32.010> you<00:01:32.100> can<00:01:32.250> play<00:01:32.430> up<00:01:32.580> to<00:01:32.610> four

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
and we'll bit will there be a series of

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.910 
and we'll bit will there be a series of
patches<00:02:16.450> or<00:02:16.570> expansions<00:02:17.170> to<00:02:17.350> build<00:02:17.560> upon

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
patches or expansions to build upon

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.220 
patches or expansions to build upon
those<00:02:18.070> surrounding<00:02:18.459> areas<00:02:18.760> right<00:02:19.540> so<00:02:19.750> that's

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
those surrounding areas right so that's

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.230 
those surrounding areas right so that's
a<00:02:20.320> really<00:02:20.560> good<00:02:20.680> question<00:02:20.740> so<00:02:21.550> what<00:02:21.940> we<00:02:22.060> want

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
a really good question so what we want

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.110 
a really good question so what we want
with<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.540> game<00:02:22.720> is<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:24.400> be<00:02:24.550> completely<00:02:25.000> open

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
with the game is to be completely open

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.410 
with the game is to be completely open
so<00:02:25.630> it's<00:02:25.750> a<00:02:25.870> big<00:02:26.140> large<00:02:27.040> vast<00:02:27.520> open<00:02:27.820> world<00:02:28.209> that

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
so it's a big large vast open world that

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.180 
so it's a big large vast open world that
you're<00:02:28.510> free<00:02:28.750> to<00:02:28.900> explore<00:02:29.200> from<00:02:29.920> when<00:02:30.100> you

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
you're free to explore from when you

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.690 
you're free to explore from when you
start<00:02:30.459> the<00:02:30.580> game<00:02:30.959> and<00:02:31.959> then<00:02:32.260> if<00:02:32.980> I<00:02:33.250> understand

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
start the game and then if I understand

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.760 
start the game and then if I understand
the<00:02:33.790> question<00:02:33.910> right<00:02:34.330> will<00:02:34.989> we<00:02:35.170> then<00:02:35.350> later<00:02:35.650> on

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
the question right will we then later on

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.650 
the question right will we then later on
expand<00:02:36.400> that<00:02:36.550> world<00:02:36.820> I<00:02:37.090> think<00:02:37.360> that's<00:02:37.510> right

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
expand that world I think that's right

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.840 
expand that world I think that's right
