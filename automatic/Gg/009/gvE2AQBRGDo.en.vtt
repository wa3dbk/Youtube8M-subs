00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.059
 I do it because I have it 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:53.089
 Well, since it's downloaded, it's going to 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.089

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.820
 description of the video 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.860
 well the first thing we have to do 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:25.390
 really the folder that says update 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:28.270

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.120
 we also consider our crispin 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:47.750
 we will go to ask for spin and game 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:50.710
 and we are going to put the updates folder 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.710
 I have no memory 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.799
 the donkey 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.490

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.180

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:25.460
 and then they go to where they have the 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.060

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.680
 good again leave in a demonstration 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.840
 well write I will not be able to because I 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.190

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.280
 well after we have 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.150

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.500
 gheit 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.560
 and the fast recovery 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.920
 and being in we'll go to the pp but 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.560
 I will have 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:02.959
 good friends because being here we 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.959
 we will go to system settings 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.280
 system information 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.140
 and here it should be version 6.60 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.450
 already we 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.450
 since we put the 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:35.140
 fast recovery 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:36.549
 we open this one that says products already when 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.530
 we would be updated at our feet 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.530
 stone 6.60 we will open it 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:02.360
 this will appear 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.360
 we will only press x 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:18.989
 since it appeared to us about we will return to 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:18.989
 give x 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.430
 it will restart 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:34.070
 and already good now is already hacked 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.689
 you from the system 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:44.689
 system formation 

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:47.529
 already as you bless 6.60 I tried 10 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:47.529
 and good yo 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:54.030
 Well, since we have it tested 10 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:56.620
 already be when they pay it badly and 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.410
 restart the console 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:02.979
 is going to remove the hack but 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:05.550
 for that we have we are going to list the 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:05.550
 games 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:14.290
 and we're going to have the fast recovery this 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.990
 was the one that we opened first, they already want 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:20.400
 is that we can erase it 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.400
 so it will not help 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:24.990
 already when we get to pay I know that 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:28.199
 will remove us in the games that 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:31.999
 we have because you already want only 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:31.999
 to see stop restarting my console 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.110
 when it resets us like this 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:56.490
 that completely matches 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.490
 if we will erase the hack 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.000
 we go to system settings 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:05.110
 and system information 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:11.139
 it's going to look like version 6.60 that 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:14.789
 reader I tried 10 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:14.789
 what we will have to do 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:24.890
 and it will show us where the games are 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.270
 as they saw I know good disappears the 

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:31.550
 game that I had and we will only open 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:35.170
 this 6.60 pro fast recovery only 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.170
 the console will reboot 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:56.100
 and we'll go right back if the system 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:58.310
 system formation as they saw from 

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:01.400
 new is hacked 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:04.580
 it's easy only when it becomes easy 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:07.120
 is to hack only reopen that 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.120
 Program 

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:20.449
 if nothing else they reopen this 

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:22.310
 the 6.60 provides 10 fast recovery the other 

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:25.100
 what can you do with just throwing it in 

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:26.660
 ships can delete it and nothing else 

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.400
 installing the fast recovery it 

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:32.280
 Restart the console and go back to 

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:37.610
 hacked is easy 

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:37.610
 well, that's all in this tutorial
