 small video review on the new smartphone 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.360
 from a company that was not so long ago 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.830
 announced in Prague and the model acquired 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.039
 the corresponding name is lost bio 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.420
 my right, well, let's start with the packaging 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.660
 configuration as we see on Dimka us 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.000
 comes with such a square white box on 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.640
 the front part we see the logo with 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.789
 inscribed club around the edges not 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.520
 thin golden frame on the back 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.930
 side of us as usual sticker with 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.210
 indicating various technical 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.450
 device characteristics let's 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.579
 look at the complete set here principle 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.160
 everything is standard besides the most

 white with such a flat section 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.110
 style and some 0 well, like the previous ones 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.119
 models but these look at the design of the legs 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.290
 device 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.170
 the front part is not very 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.119
 different from previous models in 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.750
 lineup here we have located 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:22.350
 the display above it has speaker sensors 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.540
 approximation of the front camera from the bottom 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.390
 the parts below the display are located 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.509
 home button among circles around the edges 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:35.509
 it has its menu buttons and 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:38.130
 back button inactive 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:40.650
 the device of these buttons is not visible however 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.020
 with these buttons turned on 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.960
 such reddish is highlighted 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.700
 backlit glass which covers 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.979
 covers the display but also 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.289
 made by technology worthy of d and 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.710
 have such small rounding on 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:58.860
 edges the main differences in the model 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:02.130
 are most at the edges of the device 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.229
 the remarkable thing is that it is the thinnest 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.710
 smartphone released by the thickness 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:11.550
 the hull maximum is 5 5 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:14.310
 millimeters of the edge as well as part of the back 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.819
 we cover the metal around the edges at 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:21.060
 us to the right is located top 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:23.220

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.920
 the display will analyze the various

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:08.419
 capacity of 2200 milliampere hour for such 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.510
 devices with a diagonal such that 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:14.900
 In principle, a small capacity, but here already 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:17.480
 affects the thickness of the device however 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:21.650
