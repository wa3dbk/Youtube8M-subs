00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:08.380
 I'm going to start hydrating my face with 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:12.309
 hydrated garnier cream for skins 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:14.730
 mixed and fat and I'll spread it all over 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:14.730
 my face 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.230
 then I'm going to take my base 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.410
 favorite that is the baby cream of 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:27.730
 l'oreal and I'll spread it all over my 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:29.470
 face except for the forehead and I'll do it with 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.630
 hands because I think there is a 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.800
 finishing much more natural than if 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.800
 do with a brush 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.930

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.140
 I will apply in dark circles and red 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:58.190
 imperfections that I see and I will extend 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.190
 with a sponge 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.820
 then I will take the powder 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:11.320

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.320

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.370

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:28.030
 mobile and below the water line 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.939
 next I will use the naked shadow 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.079
 and I will apply it as a base on the eyelids 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:44.079
 mobile 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.640
 then I will choose the shadow smoke 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:58.800
 and apply it on the mobile eyelids 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.800
 going up a little bit up 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:08.450
 and then catch this red shade of color 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:11.570
 mate of kiko and I will apply it in the corner 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.390
 outside of the mobile eyelid apply the 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:17.090
 super little and then blur because if 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.030
 is not going to look too exaggerated and 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:23.370

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.370

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.120
 below the water line 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.340
 focusing more on the outside 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.190
 making it fatter and in the part 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.739
 interior a little more finite is to say 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:53.360
 making the effect of big eyes and 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.360
 then blur a little 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.080
 then fuck in the shadow virgin 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:31.330

 superiors as inferior 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:57.790
 this will also give us the effect of eyes 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.510
 large in conjunction with the outlined 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.510

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:07.210
 as blush chosen east of l'oréal 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:09.790
 in a pink color and we'll be pretty 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.010
 generous with the rouge because in 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:16.440
 vitoria well I created all the looks have 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.440
 the blush that stands out a lot 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.610

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:37.650

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.620

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:47.840
