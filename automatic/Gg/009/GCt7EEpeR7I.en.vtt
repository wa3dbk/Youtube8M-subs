00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:23.690
 he has been tested for color 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:26.570
 it did not convince us that it is a magenta color 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:29.980
 which is a bit the one that looks 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.980
 above the box 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:39.750
 it was made now the ladder was made 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.750
 all in logs 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.660
 Y 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:49.800
 this part is also made with 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.770
 trunks that will then be filled 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:57.210
 with stones 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:00.840
 we have also done up all 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:04.980
 the borders and all the edges of 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.960
 the ceilings with phenolic wood 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:11.420
 recovered 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.420
 and here has also been closed 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.210
 the edges too and at this time 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:22.680
 we are doing the garage 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:28.070
 with boards of salt and wood those 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.070
 white that are left us 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:36.640
 where he came from 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:40.020
 the phenolic system is medium that does not 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:45.609
 I know almost I kill myself is going to understand is going to 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:47.390
 hinged in the background and then going to 

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:53.330
 to have 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:57.300
 will be with poles and with sharps 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:02:00.570
 poles with blocks with concrete 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:04.200
 and there is the engineer that we are with 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.870
 the design we are going to approach slowly 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:11.660
 so that he does not panic and we're going to make him 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.660
 a few questions about it 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.190

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.720
 tell me that this system has not copied it 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.720
 from somewhere 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.010
 it is of imagination 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.220
 perfect 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.780
 you ever saw a roof supported 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:42.310
 by hinges that come down like this 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.310
 it is a modernity 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.530
 so that one can lower the roof and 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:51.660
 Fix it when you want 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.660

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.120
 it would be kitchen and other environments 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:53.900
