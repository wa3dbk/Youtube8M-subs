00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.259
 hello youtube staff 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:11.250
 today we are here for demonstration 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:14.940
 from reading a canister code one 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:18.390
 that the numbering always 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.900
 box number goes number cs here 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.500
 always the last three digits 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:28.340
 that this would be an example of a little box 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.340
 702 talk 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:41.309
 good people then we disassemble 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.460
 O box first of all have to 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.710
 take the stiletto remove the varnish 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.760
 welding points 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:54.030
 Okay, so we already have the 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:58.890
 welding points to be able to weld 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:02.850
 reads the processor file 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:06.060
 so the one that is the 702 touch canister 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:15.299
 for those who do not know how one has 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:20.250
 70 4 and the 702 good touch we're already done 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:23.220
 to do the cable welding 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.689
 double is welded aquino the dots 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:30.780
 corresponding to box 702 fits in the 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.729
 is already connected to the 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.710
 and the group program is already 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.490
 connected to the computer 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:43.100
 I want to stand dad here. 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:48.040
 well here follows the photo is the who photo 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:52.100
 You have to follow Aunt ok link 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.140
 702 corresponding to the pins where 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:02:00.049
 People have to let go of the wires. 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:02.030
 Okay, so we come here to minimize and 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:08.950
 People are going to do what now open the 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.950
 upa programmer and let's have it read 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:22.240
 that I go here in programming and I go 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:29.730
 look for the processor we're going to 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:34.590
 to have to select there to whom there mc 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:38.100
 68 hr 0 5 and 6 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:42.190
 selected then I have to here the 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:49.960
 oscillator that is the goat 2021 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:53.580
 And then I'll send you a guide here. 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:55.060
 doc file read the file here with 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.660
 success 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:05.820
 there we will save 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:20.110
 let's save put here as binary 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:26.709
 I put it right there I select the 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:30.820
 work area has saved saved already 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:37.080
 will be where here the quaint 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:40.660
 now we will open the program of sed bull 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:46.410
 and then I'll select the file that the 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.410
 people just read 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:57.350
 ordered to open ready appeared to me 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:04:00.770
 Here I only get the chip of 20 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:03.230
 that it will transform into and from 11 that 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:06.850
 I dreaded that 11 and just click program 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.600
 transmitted and will already be programmed 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.150
 personal touch 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:14.150
 so we are there who have an interest in 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:17.600
 learn how you work with the 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.910
 programmer group with red bull as 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.330
 you will proceed the process to be able to 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.040
 make the general key the chip on the workbench 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.010
 get in touch with us give 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:31.400
 high keychains and mine is more good 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:36.800
 the course is available for more 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:39.830
 league details or add on skype and 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.590
 people talk to you to know 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:45.560
 How does the qualification course of 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:48.080
 key of the shower jumps and my touch 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.900
 Thank you very much everybody, everyone 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.280
 forget write on our channel a &amp; e 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:56.980
