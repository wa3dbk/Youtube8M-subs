00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.740
 It is Toyota of Sagan Tosu 

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.410
 I was aiming 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.630
 That's right 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:14.910
 Here is a good player for several years forward 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:17.950
 So there is also a part I thought was next year 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.370
 After all, I was told at that podium 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.880
 Than a place Tteyuu wanted to dental caries one of the image 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:26.550
 truly 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:29.480
 Determine your own lodging play 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.850
 I got one at a time, but there 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.010
 Yes 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:39.809
 I think it would be appreciated that I was able to receive an award in the last 3 days . 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:42.059
 His name was also taken by Mr. Hisato Sato , but when the second place of the play was said that personally 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.710
 The players are still 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.110
 It is an ugly thing if it is a single piece even in an adverse situation because it is likely to be the subject of a card 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.490
 Or 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.020
 I agree 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:55.530
 Really because that Yape spirit 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.530
 Hey Hey 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.680
 It has the feeling is becoming stronger 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:06.170
 If such a play is do we need to show vigorous strongly in the 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.310
 I think it's important to play 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.850
 Regardless of this book 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.200
 From now on 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.220
 And the planting will want a place and more and more the awareness to teammates to continue 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.120
 I think I want to live 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:22.030
 It is another floor full victory next time 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:24.740
 Well, the position of other places is firm 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.659
 Like you have chosen 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.979
 I would like to see more more 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:32.070
 How about the commitment to that title if it is possible to dispute the benefits all the way 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.600
 Is it 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.460
 Well honest 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.730
 It was a great opportunity compared to the usual city 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:46.160
 There was a place that I wanted to ask, but first of all that 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:47.270
 'S priority order of say there is still the most because it was also important because team title 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.530
 Because it was not 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:55.320
 There is no discouragement until there 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.320
 This time we will aim for the title as a team next season 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.430
 Well firmly 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.950
 Saran and that one are that 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:07.270
 To understand or rather close tradition 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.270
 Submit not raw 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.950
 I think it will continue 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.870
 That there 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:16.269
 know 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.269
 I have not been doing the players from now on
