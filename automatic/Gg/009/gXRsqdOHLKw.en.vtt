dual-core Snapdragon s4 underneath that

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.069 
dual-core Snapdragon s4 underneath that
provides<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.600> little<00:00:39.750> bit<00:00:39.840> more<00:00:39.960> performance

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
provides a little bit more performance

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.880 
provides a little bit more performance
than<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.739> f5<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:42.120> really<00:00:42.960> puts<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.469> kind<00:00:43.829> of

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
than the f5 and really puts it kind of

on top of the F line 2 gigabytes of RAM
or<00:00:46.559> inside<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:47.100> we're<00:00:47.219> getting<00:00:47.399> closer<00:00:47.610> and

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
or inside so we're getting closer and

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.549 
or inside so we're getting closer and
closer<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.660> more<00:00:48.840> high-end<00:00:49.200> specs<00:00:49.440> that

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
closer to the more high-end specs that

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.799 
closer to the more high-end specs that
were<00:00:49.770> kind<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.039> used<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:51.210> then<00:00:51.329> megapixel

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
were kind of used to and then megapixel

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.720

cameras<00:00:52.140> on<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.350> back<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:53.100> there<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.520> eight

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
cameras on the back and there is eight

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.060

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
gigabytes of storage built in however

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.770 
gigabytes of storage built in however
which<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:56.910> really<00:00:57.270> something<00:00:57.570> that's<00:00:57.600> really

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780
