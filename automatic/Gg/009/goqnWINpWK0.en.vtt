00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.140 
going pretty hard and you know a few
people<00:04:41.830> have<00:04:41.950> been<00:04:42.040> watching<00:04:42.460> and<00:04:42.580> saying<00:04:42.970> it

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
people have been watching and saying it

already looks like training camp so
we've<00:04:44.950> been<00:04:45.040> going<00:04:45.280> for<00:04:45.310> a<00:04:45.460> little<00:04:45.580> bit<00:04:45.760> and

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
we've been going for a little bit and

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.930 
we've been going for a little bit and
and<00:04:46.919> you<00:04:47.919> know<00:04:47.950> I<00:04:48.040> think<00:04:48.340> we'll<00:04:48.550> be<00:04:48.580> ready<00:04:48.820> for

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
and you know I think we'll be ready for

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.140 
and you know I think we'll be ready for
that<00:04:49.000> first<00:04:49.210> game<00:04:49.450> excited<00:04:50.440> to<00:04:50.530> see<00:04:51.030> you<00:04:52.030> know

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
that first game excited to see you know

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.630 
that first game excited to see you know
it<00:04:52.660> certainly<00:04:53.050> is<00:04:53.260> a<00:04:53.290> full<00:04:53.680> roster<00:04:54.190> of<00:04:54.610> players

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
it certainly is a full roster of players

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.850 
it certainly is a full roster of players
but<00:04:54.970> keeps<00:04:55.840> things<00:04:56.080> competitive<00:04:56.590> out<00:04:56.680> there<00:04:56.710> i

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
but keeps things competitive out there i

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.420 
but keeps things competitive out there i
guess<00:04:57.070> it's<00:04:57.280> an<00:04:58.060> easy<00:04:58.240> way<00:04:58.450> to<00:04:58.480> make<00:04:58.660> sure<00:04:58.780> that
