this is a 12 horsepower engine off the
chain<00:00:27.630> drive<00:00:28.429> bones<00:00:29.429> now<00:00:30.679> had<00:00:31.679> all<00:00:31.830> sorts<00:00:32.160> of

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
chain drive bones now had all sorts of

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.030 
chain drive bones now had all sorts of
problems<00:00:32.340> with<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.730> chain<00:00:32.940> drive<00:00:33.120> situation

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
problems with the chain drive situation

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.860 
problems with the chain drive situation
it<00:00:35.040> was<00:00:35.190> like<00:00:35.399> misaligned<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.570> was<00:00:36.660> wearing

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
it was like misaligned it was wearing

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.950 
it was like misaligned it was wearing
down<00:00:37.050> pulleys<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.559> chain<00:00:38.040> was<00:00:38.309> stretching<00:00:38.960> I

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
down pulleys the chain was stretching I

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.180 
down pulleys the chain was stretching I
was<00:00:40.410> wearing<00:00:40.739> out<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.980> master<00:00:41.219> links<00:00:43.010> the<00:00:44.010> key

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
was wearing out the master links the key

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.010 
was wearing out the master links the key
weight<00:00:44.340> kept<00:00:44.550> falling<00:00:44.850> out<00:00:44.940> on<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.390> drive

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
weight kept falling out on the drive

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.580 
weight kept falling out on the drive
shaft

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
shaft

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.220 
shaft
and<00:00:47.239> then<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.329> was<00:00:48.420> just<00:00:48.480> stripping<00:00:48.840> down<00:00:48.989> and

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
and then it was just stripping down and

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.630 
and then it was just stripping down and
stripped<00:00:49.500> out<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.739> drive<00:00:49.950> shaft<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:50.340> now<00:00:50.489> it's

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
stripped out the drive shaft so now it's

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.310 
stripped out the drive shaft so now it's
actually<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.120> need<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.390> new<00:00:51.539> drive<00:00:51.780> shaft<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:52.230> the

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
actually I need a new drive shaft to the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.790

pretty<00:01:18.960> shitty<00:01:19.200> engines<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:20.299> think<00:01:21.299> started

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
pretty shitty engines I think started

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.940 
pretty shitty engines I think started
smoking<00:01:21.960> really<00:01:22.080> bad<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.439> always<00:01:22.560> had<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.830> lot

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
of power but it started smoking really

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.020 
of power but it started smoking really
bad<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:24.869> was<00:01:24.960> hard<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.200> start<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.880> they've<00:01:26.880> got

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
bad it was hard to start and they've got

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.670 
bad it was hard to start and they've got
all<00:01:27.180> sorts<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.509> valve<00:01:27.750> problems<00:01:28.409> and

all sorts of valve problems and

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.149 
all sorts of valve problems and
Tecumseh's<00:01:29.640> they're<00:01:29.820> just<00:01:30.680> they're<00:01:31.680> not<00:01:31.710> very

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
Tecumseh's they're just they're not very

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.609

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
problems like that but it actually ran

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.249 
problems like that but it actually ran
fine<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.100> everything<00:01:44.810> I'm<00:01:45.810> gonna<00:01:45.960> throw<00:01:46.140> this

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
fine and everything I'm gonna throw this

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.710 
fine and everything I'm gonna throw this
beast<00:01:46.530> on<00:01:46.680> here<00:01:47.030> I'll<00:01:48.030> probably<00:01:48.240> even<00:01:48.450> make<00:01:48.570> it

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
beast on here I'll probably even make it

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.440 
beast on here I'll probably even make it
electric<00:01:49.530> start<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.399> it'll<00:01:50.640> charge<00:01:50.880> for<00:01:51.329> this

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
electric start and it'll charge for this

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.030 
electric start and it'll charge for this
thing<00:01:51.689> this<00:01:51.990> tractor<00:01:52.229> did<00:01:52.500> before<00:01:52.799> with<00:01:52.920> that

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
thing this tractor did before with that

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.940 
thing this tractor did before with that
engine<00:01:53.430> so<00:01:54.270> it'll<00:01:54.450> be<00:01:54.509> cool<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.810> have<00:01:54.950> electric

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
engine so it'll be cool to have electric

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
stickball ones with a lot of power cuz

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.550 
stickball ones with a lot of power cuz
normally<00:02:06.149> like<00:02:06.570> when<00:02:06.719> we<00:02:06.780> get<00:02:06.960> in<00:02:07.079> mud<00:02:07.229> they<00:02:07.500> in

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
much do the biggest tires I got so it's

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:20.759 
much do the biggest tires I got so it's
gonna<00:02:19.720> be<00:02:19.870> pretty<00:02:19.989> awesome<00:02:20.110> trying<00:02:20.680> this

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
gonna be pretty awesome trying this

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.970 
gonna be pretty awesome trying this
thing<00:02:20.830> out<00:02:21.069> like<00:02:21.220> that<00:02:21.430> and<00:02:22.590> yeah<00:02:23.590> should<00:02:23.950> be

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
thing out like that and yeah should be

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.600 
thing out like that and yeah should be
often<00:02:25.080> get<00:02:26.080> an<00:02:26.230> engine<00:02:26.500> bolted<00:02:26.860> on<00:02:27.010> got<00:02:27.519> to

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
often get an engine bolted on got to

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:28.680 
often get an engine bolted on got to
make<00:02:27.730> sure<00:02:27.819> the<00:02:27.909> pulleys<00:02:28.209> lined<00:02:28.390> up<00:02:28.599> the

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
make sure the pulleys lined up the

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.050 
make sure the pulleys lined up the
pulleys<00:02:29.019> a<00:02:29.049> little<00:02:29.349> bigger<00:02:29.610> they<00:02:30.610> came<00:02:30.879> with

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
pulleys a little bigger they came with

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.699 
pulleys a little bigger they came with
this<00:02:31.209> on<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.510> hydrostatic<00:02:31.989> and<00:02:32.349> that's<00:02:32.590> what

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
this on the hydrostatic and that's what

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.199 
this on the hydrostatic and that's what
I<00:02:32.769> had<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:33.040> put<00:02:33.190> on<00:02:33.220> it<00:02:33.430> cuz<00:02:33.579> of<00:02:33.670> crank<00:02:33.909> shafts<00:02:34.120> a

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
I had to put on it cuz of crank shafts a

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:35.490 
I had to put on it cuz of crank shafts a
different<00:02:34.510> size<00:02:34.659> in<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.049> eight<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:35.470> a

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
different size in the eight and a

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.520 
different size in the eight and a
quarter<00:02:35.650> so<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:37.150> pulley<00:02:37.450> is<00:02:37.959> a<00:02:38.019> little<00:02:38.349> bigger

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
quarter so the pulley is a little bigger

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.110 
quarter so the pulley is a little bigger
and<00:02:38.799> might<00:02:39.040> make<00:02:39.190> it<00:02:39.340> go<00:02:39.430> a<00:02:39.459> little<00:02:39.640> faster

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
and might make it go a little faster

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
and might make it go a little faster
plus<00:02:43.120> we're<00:02:43.299> gonna<00:02:43.390> arrive<00:02:43.629> the<00:02:43.750> piss<00:02:43.930> out<00:02:44.110> of

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
plus we're gonna arrive the piss out of

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.090 
plus we're gonna arrive the piss out of
it<00:02:44.290> so<00:02:44.530> that's<00:02:45.400> gonna<00:02:45.609> help<00:02:45.849> it
