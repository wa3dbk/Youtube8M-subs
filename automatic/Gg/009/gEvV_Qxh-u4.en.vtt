weapon<00:02:41.630> swapping<00:02:42.050> so<00:02:42.560> weapon<00:02:42.980> swapping<00:02:43.370> is

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
weapon swapping so weapon swapping is

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.600 
weapon swapping so weapon swapping is
like<00:02:43.940> a<00:02:44.060> lot<00:02:44.510> quicker<00:02:44.840> now<00:02:44.960> and<00:02:45.350> it<00:02:46.190> says<00:02:46.430> here

on the patch notes we've made changes to
the<00:02:48.020> way<00:02:48.050> we<00:02:48.170> cache<00:02:48.560> textures<00:02:49.100> for<00:02:49.340> alternate

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
the way we cache textures for alternate

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.150 
the way we cache textures for alternate
weapons<00:02:50.210> for<00:02:51.110> your<00:02:51.170> alternate<00:02:51.500> weapon<00:02:51.590> that

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
weapons for your alternate weapon that

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.100 
weapons for your alternate weapon that
will<00:02:52.280> allow<00:02:52.430> you<00:02:52.490> to<00:02:52.580> swap<00:02:52.900> swap<00:02:53.900> weapons

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
will allow you to swap swap weapons

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.900 
will allow you to swap swap weapons
reliably<00:02:54.740> and<00:02:54.950> instantly<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:55.580> previous

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
reliably and instantly the previous

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.250 
reliably and instantly the previous
delay<00:02:56.150> when<00:02:56.330> swapping<00:02:56.570> has<00:02:56.840> been<00:02:56.990> reduced

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
delay when swapping has been reduced

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.170 
delay when swapping has been reduced
significantly<00:02:57.380> so<00:02:58.070> swapping<00:02:58.460> your<00:02:58.910> second

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
significantly so swapping your second

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.850 
significantly so swapping your second
ability<00:02:59.360> set<00:02:59.720> will<00:02:59.870> be<00:02:59.930> seamless<00:03:00.260> and<00:03:00.560> fast

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
ability set will be seamless and fast

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.650 
ability set will be seamless and fast
making<00:03:01.190> combat<00:03:01.580> feel<00:03:01.730> more<00:03:01.940> responsive<00:03:02.450> so
