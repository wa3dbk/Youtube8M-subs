00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.699
 I do not even know how I can start 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.140
 describe this jewel of the world of 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:30.509
 video game 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.099
 limbo created in 2010 by the 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:35.280
 Danish developer play makes you 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.470
 Studies for xbox360 went on sale 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.570
 on July 21 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.610
 came to playstation network and sting 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.410
 praised by the critics and is that has 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.090
 harvested countless awards and 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.340
 memorable reviews after passing through the 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.870
 microsoft console possibly the 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.870
 best indie game of the moment 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.350
 limbo is a platform game in the 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.559
 that we have to run through the dark ones and 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.500
 beautiful landscapes jump from branch to branch 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.910
 solve puzzles among many other things 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.580
 the game is based on a principle of 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.320
 trial and error I want to say that as 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.479
 that we advance in the history that we will do 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.520
 in a lot of traps even when 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.170
 everything seems to go on wheels with a 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.030
 bad step will mean the death of 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.380
 our protagonist so it is 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.940
 inevitable fail sometimes 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.940
 to be able to move forward 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.450
 we will put ourselves in the skin of the child 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.640
 small to which we will recognize for its 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.200
 dark silhouette without shine and his eyes 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.900
 whites that we will observe throughout the 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.210
 game we will wake up in the middle of the forest 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.710
 without knowing where we are without any 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.230
 indication of where to go 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.760
 leaving us as the only option to advance to 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.650
 the right of the game 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.300
 at first glance it may seem that 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.100
 let's walk aimlessly but later 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.870
 there is the option that our 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.110
 protagonist is looking for his sister 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.110
 lost 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.370
 as we go on our way 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.710
 more children who are lost will cross 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.420
 in the forest reaching the point of wanting 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:22.280
 end our life using 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.280
 any weapon or element of the scenario 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.870
 also a horrible giant spider we 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.030
 will chase from the beginning of the game 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.920
 making our lives impossible and having 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.940
 to run out in front of her without 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.940
 stop for a second 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.200
 according to some people the limbo plot 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.329
 has a mystical meaning one of 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.700
 they tell us that our little hero 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.709
 he is dead and his whole adventure is a 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.930
 similarity of purgatory since the 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:58.640
 character ends his trip right in the 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.640
 the same place where the forest began 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.209
 another possible meaning is that all 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.250
 the complications that we will have to 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.810
 overcome in the game is the journey of 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.940
 small through hell to 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.870
 reach the sky or to assume the 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.870
 death of his sister 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.060
 as you see at a glance the story that 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:24.400
 is hiding behind the limbo is a bit 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.500
 disturbing because if we go around 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.879
 in our head it can mean something 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.310
 that for a small child is very 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:32.859
 traumatic apart from that own 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:36.629
 video game some of the deaths are not 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:36.629
 precisely soft 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.680
 possibly limbo have the controls 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.950
 simplest you've seen the last 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.740
 years if we play an xbox playstation 3 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.740
 the crosshead or the joystick 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.660
 will help us move and two simple 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:12.630
 one buttons to jump and one to 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.700
 move objects if we play with keyboard so 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.739
 we will only use the arrows and the button 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.100
 too simple control the handling does not 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.100
 you believe 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.940
 the limbo predominates the ingenuity we must 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.040
 be smart and know what to do in each 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.720
 floor puzzle company about how 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.250
 get ahead on the stage with 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.070
 the help of certain objects of 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.440
 our surroundings skip dodge 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.480
 obstacles or activate levers to move 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.220
 various machines among other things that 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.460
 of course I will not say to not disclose 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.460
 secrets 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.060
 graphically it is spectacular nothing more 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.800
 start the game can what 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.870
 we classify as a simple game of 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.730
 platforms and without color but as 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:59.270
 that we go forward we will realize 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:02.290
 that is dark sinister twisted e 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.290
 even gore 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.240
 during the whole adventure the feeling of 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.250
 loneliness is extremely great you alone 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.479
 you have to survive and move on 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.479
 without help from anyone 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.580
 we will go through varied scenarios from 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:30.590
 the forest itself where we will wake up a 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.020
 abandoned factory a small town 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.789
 where everything is destroyed all of them in 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.860
 a grayscale and without these shadows 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:40.240
 that will keep us alert to any 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.240
 threatens that we may be presented 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.720
 to all this we must add in the 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:53.000
 music but little can talk about this 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.610
 theme since it does not have a band 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.530
 own sound rather the opposite in 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.030
 The whole game will only be with us 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.310
 background the sounds of the 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.199
 scenarios such as the wind in 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.860
 the forest or the noise of machinery 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:05.860
 that we are 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.930
 and with a 30-minute radio and with 

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:32.180
 all possible images and with the 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:34.520
 best videos of the game could express 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.830
 what the silt symbolizes is a perfect 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.480
 work of art a unique setting that 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:41.830
 I've only seen in shadow of the 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.830
 colossus for playstation 2 

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.990
 It will make us think a lot about how we can 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.060
 climb to a simple platform or cross 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.680
 a puddle of water all this accompanied 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.900
 of scenarios that will make us feel 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:55.740
 what is the loneliness itself as never 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.740
 we have lived it before 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:03.199
 put on the skin of a small child in a 

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:04.940
 world of shadows and nightmares in which 

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:08.050
 death will be constantly present 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:08.050
 our way 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.729
 without a doubt it is one of the only creations 

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:16.340
 visuals that I've had the luck to 

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:18.970
 try and enjoy it I recommend it to you 

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.970
 one hundred by one hundred 

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:26.490
 see you in the next guys up 

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.490
 other
