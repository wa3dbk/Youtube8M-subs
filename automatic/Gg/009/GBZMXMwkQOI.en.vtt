multiple<00:00:25.410> reasons<00:00:25.619> for<00:00:25.980> that<00:00:26.099> first<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.150> all<00:00:27.210> I

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
multiple reasons for that first of all I

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.570 
multiple reasons for that first of all I
think<00:00:27.449> their<00:00:27.840> complaint<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.349> complete<00:00:28.800> and

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
think their complaint is complete and

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.569 
think their complaint is complete and
total<00:00:30.029> trash<00:00:31.009> the<00:00:32.009> reason<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.550> because

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
total trash the reason is because

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.670 
total trash the reason is because
they're<00:00:33.480> complaining<00:00:33.780> about<00:00:33.960> one<00:00:34.260> same<00:00:34.530> in

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
the game where you basically take the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.110 
the game where you basically take the
rule<00:00:36.780> as<00:00:37.489> you're<00:00:38.489> looking<00:00:38.610> through<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.030> eyes

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
rule as you're looking through the eyes

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.459

the first thing that happened the report

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.160 
the first thing that happened the report
that<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:01.050> had<00:01:01.379> an<00:01:01.620> issue<00:01:01.800> with<00:01:01.980> was<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.969> the

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
that I had an issue with was that the

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.679 
that I had an issue with was that the
the<00:01:04.170> main<00:01:04.379> anchor<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.040> interviewer<00:01:05.489> who<00:01:05.939> was

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
the main anchor the interviewer who was

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.770 
the main anchor the interviewer who was
overseeing<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.560> debate<00:01:07.970> coded<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.090> fair<00:01:09.479> and

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
overseeing the debate coded a fair and

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.120 
overseeing the debate coded a fair and
balanced<00:01:10.260> debate<00:01:11.270> which<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.420> thought<00:01:13.130> was

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
balanced debate which I thought was

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.870 
balanced debate which I thought was
completely<00:01:14.850> in<00:01:15.810> total<00:01:16.409> BS<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:17.369> was<00:01:17.490> not<00:01:17.640> fair

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
completely in total BS that was not fair

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.490 
completely in total BS that was not fair
and<00:01:18.000> balanced<00:01:18.330> whatsoever<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:19.110> wasn't<00:01:19.380> fair

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
and balanced whatsoever that wasn't fair

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.410 
and balanced whatsoever that wasn't fair
at<00:01:19.650> all<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.890> was<00:01:19.979> completely<00:01:20.340> biased<00:01:20.610> as<00:01:21.030> most

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
at all it was completely biased as most

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.350 
at all it was completely biased as most

it was inappropriate okay let me try to
explain<00:02:02.000> what<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.060> think<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.390> developer<00:02:03.750> was

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
explain what I think the developer was

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.690 
explain what I think the developer was
trying<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.110> go<00:02:04.200> for<00:02:04.439> on<00:02:04.619> this<00:02:04.829> I<00:02:05.009> think<00:02:05.670> a

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
trying to go for on this I think a

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.109 
trying to go for on this I think a
developer<00:02:06.180> was<00:02:06.360> trying<00:02:06.770> to<00:02:07.770> let<00:02:08.310> people<00:02:08.580> see

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
developer was trying to let people see

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.940 
developer was trying to let people see
the<00:02:09.270> horror<00:02:09.599> of<00:02:09.750> terrorism<00:02:10.530> through<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.830> eyes

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
the horror of terrorism through the eyes

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.720 
the horror of terrorism through the eyes
of

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
of

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.550 
of
first<00:02:13.030> again<00:02:13.480> it<00:02:13.720> wasn't<00:02:14.110> technically<00:02:14.440> a

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
first again it wasn't technically a

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.309 
first again it wasn't technically a
terrorist<00:02:15.099> but<00:02:15.750> it<00:02:16.750> doesn't<00:02:17.019> really<00:02:17.080> matter

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
terrorist but it doesn't really matter

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.080 
terrorist but it doesn't really matter
you're<00:02:17.860> seeing<00:02:18.159> it<00:02:18.280> through<00:02:18.430> the<00:02:18.519> eyes<00:02:18.640> of<00:02:18.970> the

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
you're seeing it through the eyes of the

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.059 
you're seeing it through the eyes of the
actual<00:02:19.480> killer<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:19.930> ones<00:02:20.110> whose<00:02:20.290> one<00:02:20.890> who's

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
actual killer the ones whose one who's

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.490 
actual killer the ones whose one who's
committing<00:02:21.549> the<00:02:21.670> act<00:02:21.959> which<00:02:22.959> i<00:02:23.140> think<00:02:23.200> is

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
committing the act which i think is

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.160 
committing the act which i think is
sense<00:02:23.890> of<00:02:24.040> more<00:02:24.549> powerful<00:02:25.239> message<00:02:25.659> than<00:02:25.870> just

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
sense of more powerful message than just

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.190 
sense of more powerful message than just
having<00:02:26.709> a<00:02:26.920> terrorist<00:02:27.370> act<00:02:27.580> in<00:02:27.790> a<00:02:27.849> game<00:02:28.090> and<00:02:28.420> the

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
having a terrorist act in a game and the

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.410 
having a terrorist act in a game and the
idea<00:02:29.590> is<00:02:29.680> not<00:02:30.099> to<00:02:30.160> let<00:02:30.580> people<00:02:30.610> kill<00:02:31.390> people

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
idea is not to let people kill people

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.830 
idea is not to let people kill people
the<00:02:32.410> idea<00:02:32.890> is<00:02:32.980> to<00:02:33.220> leave<00:02:33.760> an<00:02:33.910> impact<00:02:34.360> because

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
the idea is to leave an impact because

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.690 
the idea is to leave an impact because
one<00:02:35.110> of<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.260> reasons<00:02:35.590> I<00:02:35.739> really<00:02:36.010> like<00:02:36.370> the

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
one of the reasons I really like the

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.670 
one of the reasons I really like the
modern<00:02:37.000> warfare<00:02:37.180> to<00:02:37.959> be<00:02:38.049> fair<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.379> call<00:02:38.560> of

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
modern warfare to be fair the call of

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.250 
modern warfare to be fair the call of
duty<00:02:38.920> series<00:02:39.160> in<00:02:39.400> general<00:02:39.549> is<00:02:40.299> because<00:02:40.989> it

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
duty series in general is because it

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.729 
duty series in general is because it
creates<00:02:42.099> such<00:02:42.310> a<00:02:42.459> realistic<00:02:43.269> sense<00:02:43.599> of<00:02:43.930> what

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
creates such a realistic sense of what

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.339 
creates such a realistic sense of what
war<00:02:45.040> is<00:02:45.370> or<00:02:45.879> what<00:02:46.090> and<00:02:46.269> what<00:02:46.510> violence<00:02:46.930> is<00:02:47.110> like

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
war is or what and what violence is like

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.720 
war is or what and what violence is like
and<00:02:48.069> because<00:02:48.370> that<00:02:48.579> I<00:02:48.610> think<00:02:48.970> it's<00:02:49.090> more<00:02:49.180> of<00:02:49.959> a

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
and because that I think it's more of a

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.059 
and because that I think it's more of a
deterrent<00:02:51.959> for<00:02:52.959> committing<00:02:53.560> such<00:02:53.769> acts

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
deterrent for committing such acts

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.250 
deterrent for committing such acts
rather<00:02:54.519> than<00:02:54.760> an<00:02:54.970> encouragement<00:02:55.629> because

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
rather than an encouragement because

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.690 
rather than an encouragement because
anyone<00:02:56.620> would<00:02:56.799> have<00:02:56.920> a<00:02:56.950> brain<00:02:57.280> could<00:02:57.459> tell

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
anyone would have a brain could tell

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.089 
anyone would have a brain could tell
that<00:02:58.209> it<00:02:58.239> was<00:02:58.450> all<00:02:58.720> just<00:02:59.230> fantasy<00:02:59.530> violence

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
that it was all just fantasy violence

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.490 
that it was all just fantasy violence
but<00:03:00.400> it<00:03:00.489> was<00:03:00.609> made<00:03:00.819> to<00:03:00.970> look<00:03:01.120> so<00:03:01.420> real<00:03:01.780> that<00:03:02.109> it

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
but it was made to look so real that it

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.410 
but it was made to look so real that it
sets<00:03:02.859> a<00:03:02.950> lasting<00:03:03.370> impression<00:03:03.489> on<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.150> player

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
sets a lasting impression on the player

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.589 
sets a lasting impression on the player
but<00:03:05.019> it's<00:03:05.140> one<00:03:05.470> that's<00:03:06.000> anti-terrorist<00:03:07.000> not

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
but it's one that's anti-terrorist not

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.259 
but it's one that's anti-terrorist not
pro<00:03:08.019> terrorist<00:03:08.650> that's<00:03:09.489> all<00:03:09.700> I'm<00:03:09.879> trying<00:03:09.910> to

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
pro terrorist that's all I'm trying to

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.089 
pro terrorist that's all I'm trying to
