00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
which you know I have to assume that

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.310 
which you know I have to assume that
they<00:00:43.739> are<00:00:44.120> how<00:00:45.120> can<00:00:45.149> they<00:00:45.420> not<00:00:45.450> be<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:46.170> know<00:00:46.289> a

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
they are how can they not be you know a

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.290 
they are how can they not be you know a
great<00:00:46.649> bet<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.219> get<00:00:47.399> just<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:48.030> know<00:00:48.120> a

one-point win on the road in Dallas what
do<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.850> think<00:00:51.050> you<00:00:52.050> know<00:00:52.170> I'm<00:00:52.320> rolling<00:00:53.160> with

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
Dallas in this one Peter I think the

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.420 
Dallas in this one Peter I think the
public<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.530> going<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.800> be<00:00:55.920> all<00:00:56.039> over<00:00:56.190> New<00:00:56.280> York

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
public is going to be all over New York

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.220 
public is going to be all over New York
why<00:00:56.610> am<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:56.879> on<00:00:56.910> Dallas<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.480> know<00:00:57.510> Dallas<00:00:57.809> has

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
why am I on Dallas you know Dallas has

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.400 
why am I on Dallas you know Dallas has
not<00:00:58.649> put<00:00:59.010> together<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.760> solid<00:01:00.539> football<00:01:00.989> game

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
not put together a solid football game

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.779 
not put together a solid football game
since<00:01:01.710> week<00:01:01.920> one<00:01:01.949> when<00:01:02.250> they<00:01:02.370> took<00:01:02.520> care<00:01:02.579> of

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
since week one when they took care of

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.030 
since week one when they took care of
the<00:01:02.910> Giants<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.300> they<00:01:03.390> won<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.690> game<00:01:04.040> 24-17

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
the Giants and they won that game 24-17

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.710 
the Giants and they won that game 24-17
I<00:01:05.070> think<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.790> could<00:01:06.030> have<00:01:06.180> been<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.479> lot<00:01:06.659> worse

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
I think it could have been a lot worse

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.570 
I think it could have been a lot worse
than<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.350> think<00:01:07.439> Dallas<00:01:07.950> matches<00:01:08.400> up

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
than that I think Dallas matches up

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.550 
than that I think Dallas matches up
really<00:01:09.420> well<00:01:09.659> against<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.049> Giants<00:01:10.350> this<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.530> a

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
really well against the Giants this is a

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.770 
really well against the Giants this is a
must-win<00:01:11.070> for<00:01:11.250> Dallas<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:11.880> think<00:01:12.030> New<00:01:12.119> York<00:01:12.299> New

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
must-win for Dallas I think New York New

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.120 
must-win for Dallas I think New York New
York's<00:01:12.960> in<00:01:13.080> first<00:01:13.290> place<00:01:13.470> they're<00:01:13.770> kind<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.040> a

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
York's in first place they're kind of a

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.560 
York's in first place they're kind of a
cruise<00:01:14.369> control<00:01:14.760> mode<00:01:14.939> i'm<00:01:15.119> not<00:01:15.299> saying

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
cruise control mode i'm not saying

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.910 
cruise control mode i'm not saying
they're<00:01:15.689> not<00:01:15.720> going<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.170> be<00:01:16.259> up<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.409> for<00:01:16.799> this

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
they're not going to be up to for this

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.740 
they're not going to be up to for this
game<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.280> revenge<00:01:17.549> dr.<00:01:17.729> plays<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.150> big<00:01:18.420> part<00:01:18.450> in

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
game the revenge dr. plays a big part in

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.140 
game the revenge dr. plays a big part in
it<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:19.020> think<00:01:19.530> Tony<00:01:19.799> Romo<00:01:20.220> has<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:20.759> much<00:01:20.939> to

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
it I think Tony Romo has so much to

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.210 
it I think Tony Romo has so much to
prove<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.509> this<00:01:21.659> game<00:01:21.900> Jason<00:01:22.560> Garrett<00:01:22.860> has<00:01:22.979> so

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
prove in this game Jason Garrett has so

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
division title race I like Dallas in

division title race I like Dallas in
this<00:04:08.459> game<00:04:08.640> the<00:04:08.790> Giants<00:04:09.269> they've<00:04:09.840> been<00:04:09.989> in

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
this game the Giants they've been in

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.810 
this game the Giants they've been in
just<00:04:10.290> as<00:04:10.470> inconsistent<00:04:10.950> as<00:04:11.160> anybody<00:04:11.549> as<00:04:11.640> well

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
just as inconsistent as anybody as well

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.009 
just as inconsistent as anybody as well
I<00:04:11.850> know<00:04:12.030> the<00:04:12.150> record<00:04:12.450> doesn't<00:04:12.600> really<00:04:12.780> show<00:04:12.989> it

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
I know the record doesn't really show it

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.300 
I know the record doesn't really show it
but<00:04:13.260> they've<00:04:13.410> played<00:04:13.650> some<00:04:13.799> type<00:04:13.980> of<00:04:14.010> ball

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
but they've played some type of ball

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.620 
but they've played some type of ball
games<00:04:14.340> I<00:04:14.549> don't<00:04:14.580> think<00:04:14.760> this<00:04:15.030> is<00:04:15.090> the<00:04:15.239> Super

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
games I don't think this is the Super

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.599 
games I don't think this is the Super
Bowl<00:04:15.660> Giants<00:04:16.229> of<00:04:16.320> the<00:04:16.350> year<00:04:16.590> ago<00:04:16.799> I<00:04:17.010> think

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
Bowl Giants of the year ago I think

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:18.890 
Bowl Giants of the year ago I think
dallas<00:04:17.880> wins<00:04:18.090> i<00:04:18.269> really<00:04:18.479> do<00:04:18.570> i<00:04:18.600> think<00:04:18.810> they

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
dallas wins i really do i think they

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.360 
dallas wins i really do i think they
established<00:04:19.410> the<00:04:19.530> run<00:04:19.709> game<00:04:19.919> early<00:04:20.250> and<00:04:20.280> i

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
established the run game early and i

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.130 
established the run game early and i
think<00:04:20.580> romo<00:04:20.760> is<00:04:20.880> a<00:04:21.030> big<00:04:21.209> game<00:04:21.359> all<00:04:21.870> right

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140
