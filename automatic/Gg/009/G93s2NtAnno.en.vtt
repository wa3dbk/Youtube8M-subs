00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.640 

well<00:03:02.970> tree-stump<00:03:03.450> did<00:03:03.720> have<00:03:03.930> a<00:03:03.959> lot<00:03:04.200> more<00:03:04.230> java

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
well tree-stump did have a lot more java

moss<00:03:04.890> on<00:03:05.159> it<00:03:05.330> until<00:03:06.330> the<00:03:06.690> crayfish<00:03:07.049> got<00:03:07.290> a

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
moss on it until the crayfish got a

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:47.160 
moss on it until the crayfish got a
little<00:03:07.650> bit

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.800 

the<00:03:47.620> substrates<00:03:48.160> just<00:03:48.460> pool<00:03:49.090> filter<00:03:49.510> sand

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
the substrates just pool filter sand

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.920 
the substrates just pool filter sand
it's<00:03:50.380> extremely<00:03:50.890> cheap

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.089 

it's<00:03:56.409> about<00:03:56.590> nine<00:03:57.549> or<00:03:57.700> ten<00:03:57.730> dollars<00:03:58.180> a<00:03:58.209> bag<00:03:58.510> I

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
it's about nine or ten dollars a bag I

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.490 
it's about nine or ten dollars a bag I
think<00:04:00.099> there's<00:04:00.510> three<00:04:01.510> bags<00:04:01.930> in<00:04:02.170> there<00:04:02.349> right

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
think there's three bags in there right

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:09.420 
think there's three bags in there right
now<00:04:05.640> the<00:04:06.640> rocks<00:04:06.909> were<00:04:07.150> free<00:04:07.829> most<00:04:08.829> expensive

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
now the rocks were free most expensive

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.490 
now the rocks were free most expensive
was<00:04:09.549> the<00:04:11.310> background<00:04:12.310> surprisingly<00:04:13.500> two

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
was the background surprisingly two

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.920 
was the background surprisingly two
sheets<00:04:14.799> of<00:04:14.950> the<00:04:15.040> house<00:04:15.189> insulation<00:04:15.819> was<00:04:16.000> quite

expensive

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.410 

I'll<00:04:45.000> do<00:04:45.120> some<00:04:45.270> other<00:04:45.420> videos<00:04:45.750> on<00:04:47.210> the<00:04:48.210> full

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
I'll do some other videos on the full

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:49.880 
I'll do some other videos on the full
filtration<00:04:48.990> system<00:04:49.350> and<00:04:49.410> everything<00:04:49.740> else

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890 
filtration system and everything else

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.260 
filtration system and everything else
behind<00:04:50.130> which<00:04:50.940> you<00:04:51.090> can't<00:04:51.360> see<00:04:53.090> put<00:04:54.090> some

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
behind which you can't see put some

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.490 
behind which you can't see put some
links<00:04:54.480> up<00:04:54.720> to<00:04:54.750> the<00:04:54.840> pictures<00:04:55.230> of<00:04:55.350> how<00:04:55.440> the

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
links up to the pictures of how the

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.230 
links up to the pictures of how the
background<00:04:55.740> was<00:04:56.040> done<00:04:56.220> and<00:04:56.340> so<00:04:56.490> forth<00:04:56.760> but<00:04:57.000> for

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
background was done and so forth but for

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.240 
background was done and so forth but for
now<00:04:57.360> I<00:04:58.700> think<00:04:59.700> that's<00:05:00.000> it
