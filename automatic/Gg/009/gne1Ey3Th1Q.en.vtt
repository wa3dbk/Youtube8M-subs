00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.630 
so he did either getting this amount of
like<00:01:39.329> this<00:01:39.930> basically<00:01:40.409> this<00:01:40.710> attack<00:01:41.070> strategy

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
like this basically this attack strategy

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.240 
like this basically this attack strategy
it's<00:01:42.180> really<00:01:42.450> awesome<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:43.140> there's<00:01:44.040> this

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
it's really awesome and there's this

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.649 
it's really awesome and there's this
Archer<00:01:44.579> Queen<00:01:44.729> in<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:44.970> middle<00:01:45.270> she's

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
Archer Queen in the middle she's

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.270 
Archer Queen in the middle she's
probably<00:01:45.869> going<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.170> die<00:01:46.200> out<00:01:46.439> soon<00:01:46.470> she's

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
probably going to die out soon she's

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.249 
probably going to die out soon she's
taking<00:01:47.640> free<00:01:47.850> hits<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.240> hitting<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.689> wall<00:01:48.960> so

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
taking free hits and hitting the wall so

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.450 
taking free hits and hitting the wall so
we'll<00:01:50.100> see<00:01:50.250> what<00:01:50.369> happens<00:01:50.490> with<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.110> but<00:01:52.110> as

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
we'll see what happens with that but as

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.770 
we'll see what happens with that but as
I<00:01:53.460> can<00:01:53.670> see<00:01:53.880> his<00:01:54.060> witches<00:01:54.420> are<00:01:54.540> still

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
I can see his witches are still

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.319 
I can see his witches are still
deploying<00:01:55.170> skeletons<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.100> going<00:01:56.549> ham<00:01:56.729> so

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
deploying skeletons and going ham so

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.969 
deploying skeletons and going ham so
i'ma<00:01:57.420> go<00:01:57.540> ahead<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:57.899> speed<00:01:58.409> this<00:01:58.500> up<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.829> little

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
i'ma go ahead and speed this up a little

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.480
