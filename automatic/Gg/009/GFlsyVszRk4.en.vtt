00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.250
 surely you have observed how 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.170
 some people addicted to 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.580
 video games daily spend long 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.860
 hours in front of a screen 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.630
 television or computer manipulating 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.880
 controls and pressing keys to 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.740
 become winners of a battle 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.450
 virtual but do you know that you are 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.489
 funny naked eye actions 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.890
 could generate them death as well 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:34.930
 serious physical and psychological disorders 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.360
 according to the specialists the 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.850
 video games mainly affect the 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.710
 sight and to the brain if a young man or boy 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.960
 play for more than two hours in front of a 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.179
 monitor the eye practically stops 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.309
 blink and it could stay dry 

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:50.879
 for several minutes situation that 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.649
 obviously it is not good for this body 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.019
 we know we know that normally the 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:59.050
 human flashes around 18 times 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:01.109
 per minute when we are before 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.039
 a computer or a video game 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.409
 unconsciously or consciously we leave 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.840
 of blinking and then decreasing 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.760
 our blinking and what that indicates indicates 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.950
 that is going to lack lubrication to our 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.229
 eyeball in the anterior part the 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.030
 conjunctival colonel and this is going on 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.200
 to translate has been enough to say in one eye 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.490
 dry in one eye 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.490
 in a crying little boy 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.369
 also those who entertain 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.020
 often with video games 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.869
 they are also prone to develop 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.850
 myopia is difficult to see from 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.890
 away since your eyes get used to 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.780
 small spaces of vision and even 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.090
 in more serious cases they develop attacks 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.780
 epileptics that could cause them 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.820
 death according to some authors 1% of 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.460
 some kids 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.430
 can develop epileptic seizures if 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.020
 have this history of epilepsy not 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.630
 seizures if they have 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.690
 history of epilepsy caused 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.789
 because the flashes are from 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.679
 video game or the pose of the 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:02.140
 computer and also by the changes 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:04.360
 abrupt and sudden colors is 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.310
 children with predisposition can 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.350
 develop epileptic seizures while being 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.960
 watching this these video games 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.940
 but that's not all serious when the 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.220
 addiction causes individuals to 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.230
 isolate the loneliness the invades are 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.880
 irritable and if the video games that 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.190
 they practice show violent behavior 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.830
 may develop suicidal tendencies 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.530
 however in japan it has been reported 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.020
 enough cases of teenagers 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.470
 they lock in their room for months to play 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.870
 video games go out to look for food when 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.380
 the other members of the family 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.320
 they are already sleeping and they lock themselves in their 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.390
 completely isolated room is difficult 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.940
 by the characteristics of mexico and in 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.490
 general of Latin America that we are more and 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.230
 we are more in direct contact we look for 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.600
 more communication within the family 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.600
 There have been strong problems there and the 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.910
 parents can not get the children out of the 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.370
 fourth and there are strong strong problems 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.620
 they stop studying or they stop working 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.670
 isolate is enclosed and there one or two pass 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.830
 months only playing video games 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.959
 however if the entertainment in 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.180
 question is experienced with no measure 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.310
 causes problems or can even be of 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.810
 benefit for players wake up 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.720
 your reasoning abilities 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.470
 abstract improve their reflexes 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.840
 psychomotor and develop 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.060
 concentration skills analysis 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.130
 as well as problem solving then yes 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.069
 they follow different strategies to pass 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.330
 to the next good level 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.650
 for me the video games have always 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.360
 been a pretty distraction 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.040
 entertaining since if they have 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.160
 suddenly absorbed days 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.140
 complete and set aside certain 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.819
 parts of my work however always 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.709
 trying to balance it with all 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:47.000
 other charges that I have to do as 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.769
 good college student one of 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.500
 my duties is to go working day by day 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:53.690
 to form the profession that I'm going to 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.519
 exercise in the future but never leaving 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.260
 aside this part of being able to entertain 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.330
 with something to decrease the pressure and the 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.190
 attention that everyday life can 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.540
 get to generate in general always 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.239
 I tried to keep the games that 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.920
 way in any way do not miss out on 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.019
 seen that fun is part of the 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.670
 development of our childhood and youth 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.190
 so to avoid negative effects 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.420
 experts recommend regulating 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.280
 activities and establish 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.570
 rules in the home elaborate a schedule 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.180
 to carry out the different 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.130
 school activities at home and 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.810
 friends establish an agreement with the 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.370
 children to accept that the 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.960
 video games or television 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.669
 directly related to 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.650
 responsibilities that they should have in 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:33.050
 home related to their times 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.750
 study and performance and encourage 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.669
 video games without violence with images
