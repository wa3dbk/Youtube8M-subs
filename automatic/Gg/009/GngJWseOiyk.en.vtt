00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.900
 Looking over the Gladbacher Tor, there are two deceptive impressions 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.660
 firstly, the ranks appear fuller than they second why the Brunswicks 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.919
 dark clothing more offensive than actually 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:17.289
 in those first minutes Braunschweig tried to surprise as in the case of 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:18.849
 last victory in Schalke 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:23.810
 here in Gladbach, however, they encountered a defense directed by Folks 

00:00:23.809 --> 00:00:26.130
 the out speed game IV 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.659
 the place explosive 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:31.449
 so free that all-inclusive coach Auto Kniffler 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:34.750
 startled their matrimonial pace with chewing 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.600
 Throw in Wimmer to Kulik 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.520
 Netzer pace 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.910
 Netzer technology 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.600
 Butcher gate 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.390
 an Austrias 1 to 0 in the third minute of play 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.550
 the series of fast gates 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.880
 Brunswick had to attack 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.920
 from this perspective especially clear how wide and long as me the 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.920
 Team tried 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.520
 Vorstopper Surer to Libero Folkerts 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.340
 Director Tim Mälzer security and speed under this pressure 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.340
 Brunswick error 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.090
 a kiss 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.970
 two to zero after just fifteen minutes 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.550
 Tens of thousands burst into cheers 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.520
 again the goal Haunstetten first mistake 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.520
 the second 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.400
 after this fast team performance great mood 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.400
 Wimmer to Jens Lehmann 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.530
 Herbert Wimmer Inländer game forms 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.780
 Refreshment is 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.960
 just past his hundredth Bundesliga goal 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.470
 how much Heimke was denied his 100th goal 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.470
 mainly by 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:19.069
 the Braunschweiger are more stable than the Bundesliga start are not the 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.069
 Team that made up a 0 to 2 

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:27.089
 especially as living under Wimmers speed lives 

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:33.009
 not only 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.069
 a kiss survey 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:47.729
 Günter Netzer 

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:50.679
 nervous chewing even after the break 

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:55.479
 Cheers year on with Wimmer with Tempo with technology with Kulik 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:06.989
 Toad Franke finally opportunity his appointment to the national team 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.039
 To confirm Skypes 

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:14.539
 but a test lurks on his hundredth goal guarded by Peter Kock 

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:18.639
 Record Bundesliga player for 280 Ston times 

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:23.469
 resistant 

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:27.639
 Beese and the Braunschweiger are still solid under this pressure 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:32.389
 too solid 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.989
 Fun wit at Bose year 

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:43.919
 Danner goalkeeper Franke margin then a3 to zero 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:45.299
