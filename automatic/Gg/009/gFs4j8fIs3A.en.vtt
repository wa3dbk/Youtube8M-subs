able<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.780> drag<00:01:10.380> these<00:01:10.650> lines<00:01:12.560> and<00:01:14.450> this<00:01:15.450> is

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
able to drag these lines and this is

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.429 
able to drag these lines and this is
simply<00:01:15.960> by<00:01:16.110> just<00:01:16.140> holding<00:01:16.710> down<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:18.200> the<00:01:19.200> left

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439

mouse button and pulling and moving
these<00:01:22.890> lines<00:01:23.159> around<00:01:24.020> so<00:01:25.020> I'm<00:01:25.140> also<00:01:25.320> able<00:01:25.590> to

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
these lines around so I'm also able to

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.520 
these lines around so I'm also able to
hold<00:01:26.189> down<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.400> ctrl<00:01:26.909> key<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.450> again<00:01:28.049> drag

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
hold down the ctrl key and again drag

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.770 
hold down the ctrl key and again drag
these<00:01:28.740> lines<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.340> this<00:01:29.759> will<00:01:29.939> copy<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.630> drag

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
these lines and this will copy and drag

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.410 
these lines and this will copy and drag
a<00:01:30.990> line<00:01:31.490> so<00:01:32.490> as<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.670> can<00:01:32.759> see<00:01:32.820> this<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.210> very

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
a line so as you can see this is very

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.260 
a line so as you can see this is very
useful<00:01:33.869> for<00:01:33.900> duplicating<00:01:34.860> lines<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.520> adding

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
useful for duplicating lines and adding

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.910 
useful for duplicating lines and adding
in<00:01:36.479> new<00:01:37.430> design<00:01:38.430> lines<00:01:38.729> very<00:01:38.970> quickly<00:01:39.860> okay<00:01:40.860> so

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
in new design lines very quickly okay so

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.819 
in new design lines very quickly okay so
I'm<00:01:41.100> just<00:01:41.130> going<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.460> delete<00:01:41.579> that<00:01:41.729> line<00:01:42.090> and

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
I'm just going to delete that line and

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:44.870 
I'm just going to delete that line and
I'm<00:01:43.829> also<00:01:44.009> going<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.310> show<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.729> we're

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
I'm also going to show you that we're

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.120 
I'm also going to show you that we're
now<00:01:45.030> able<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.509> use<00:01:45.659> something<00:01:46.560> called<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.950> V

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
now able to use something called the V

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.999 
now able to use something called the V
King<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:48.420> this<00:01:48.600> allows<00:01:48.840> me<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.320> maybe<00:01:49.740> draw

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
King so this allows me to maybe draw

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.789 
King so this allows me to maybe draw
some<00:01:50.040> white<00:01:50.430> lines<00:01:50.729> for<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.299> sole<00:01:51.720> design<00:01:52.619> and

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
some white lines for the sole design and

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.030 
some white lines for the sole design and
if<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:52.979> just<00:01:54.320> start<00:01:55.320> during<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.649> line<00:01:55.829> round

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
if I just start during a line round

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.670 
if I just start during a line round
there<00:01:56.280> at<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.579> bottom<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.060> last<00:01:57.560> once<00:01:58.560> I

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
there at the bottom of the last once I

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.109 
there at the bottom of the last once I
get<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:58.950> an<00:01:59.070> area<00:01:59.310> where<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.490> want<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.759> move<00:01:59.939> I

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
get to an area where I want to move I

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.670 
get to an area where I want to move I
can<00:02:00.299> press<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.630> V<00:02:00.780> key<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.560> will<00:02:01.649> zoom

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
can press the V key and it will zoom

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.300 
can press the V key and it will zoom
into<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.130> area<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.759> move<00:02:02.969> around<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.899> last

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
into that area and move around the last

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.010 
into that area and move around the last
so<00:02:05.310> again<00:02:05.490> if<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:05.700> move<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.119> front<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.630> hold

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
so again if I move to the front and hold

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.339 
so again if I move to the front and hold
down<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.170> V<00:02:07.380> key<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:08.489> pounds<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:10.170> last

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
down the V key it pounds the the last

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.290 
down the V key it pounds the the last
right<00:02:10.739> round<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.250> front<00:02:11.520> so<00:02:11.970> it's<00:02:12.120> very

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
right round to the front so it's very

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.000 
right round to the front so it's very
quick<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:12.690> very<00:02:12.780> useful<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:13.379> draw<00:02:13.530> lines

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
quick and very useful to draw lines

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.670 
quick and very useful to draw lines
all<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.610> way<00:02:14.700> around<00:02:14.909> the<00:02:15.030> front<00:02:15.470> all<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.530> way

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
all the way around the front all the way

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.850 
all the way around the front all the way
around<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.430> last<00:02:17.640> sorry

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
around the last sorry

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:29.119 
around the last sorry
okay<00:02:25.159> okay<00:02:26.159> so<00:02:26.220> that<00:02:26.459> is<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:27.000> V<00:02:27.239> key<00:02:28.040> so<00:02:29.040> the

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
okay okay so that is the V key so the

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:30.500 
okay okay so that is the V key so the
next<00:02:29.310> thing<00:02:29.519> we're<00:02:29.640> going<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.849> show<00:02:30.030> you<00:02:30.060> is

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
next thing we're going to show you is

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.940 
next thing we're going to show you is
the<00:02:31.140> offset<00:02:32.069> line<00:02:32.549> tool<00:02:33.650> just<00:02:34.650> like<00:02:34.739> Ann

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
the offset line tool just like Ann

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.740 
the offset line tool just like Ann
shoemaker<00:02:35.280> before<00:02:35.670> we<00:02:35.790> were<00:02:35.849> able<00:02:36.209> to<00:02:36.239> offset

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
shoemaker before we were able to offset

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.110 
shoemaker before we were able to offset
lines<00:02:37.019> but<00:02:37.920> we've<00:02:38.040> now<00:02:38.190> got<00:02:38.400> a<00:02:38.430> new<00:02:38.579> dialog<00:02:39.090> box

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
lines but we've now got a new dialog box

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.190 
lines but we've now got a new dialog box
that<00:02:39.629> enables<00:02:39.989> us<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.489> see<00:02:41.489> more<00:02:41.519> clearly<00:02:42.200> the

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
that enables us to see more clearly the

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.869 
that enables us to see more clearly the
offset<00:02:43.650> of<00:02:43.769> the<00:02:43.890> line<00:02:44.069> so<00:02:44.250> if<00:02:44.310> I<00:02:44.400> just<00:02:44.609> select

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
offset of the line so if I just select

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.240 
offset of the line so if I just select
this<00:02:45.030> line<00:02:45.209> here<00:02:45.420> that<00:02:45.450> I've<00:02:45.659> just<00:02:45.810> made

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
this line here that I've just made

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.690 
this line here that I've just made
select<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.459> offset<00:02:47.909> line<00:02:48.840> tool<00:02:49.400> then<00:02:50.400> you<00:02:50.549> can

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
select the offset line tool then you can

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.259 
select the offset line tool then you can
see<00:02:50.819> we've<00:02:50.940> got<00:02:51.060> this<00:02:51.180> new<00:02:51.390> dialog<00:02:51.870> box<00:02:52.139> here

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
see we've got this new dialog box here

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.059 
see we've got this new dialog box here
so<00:02:54.269> we've<00:02:54.389> got<00:02:54.420> this<00:02:54.659> plus<00:02:54.900> or<00:02:55.109> minus<00:02:55.440> icon<00:02:55.829> so

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
so we've got this plus or minus icon so

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.339 
so we've got this plus or minus icon so
this<00:02:56.250> allows<00:02:57.090> me<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.389> tell<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.900> line<00:02:58.079> whether

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
this allows me to tell the line whether

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.740 
this allows me to tell the line whether
I<00:02:58.440> want<00:02:58.709> it<00:02:58.859> in<00:02:59.639> front<00:03:00.000> or<00:03:00.150> behind<00:03:00.209> of<00:03:00.629> the

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
I want it in front or behind of the

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.490 
I want it in front or behind of the
original<00:03:01.139> line<00:03:01.319> and<00:03:02.010> we've<00:03:02.220> also<00:03:02.430> got<00:03:02.819> the

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
original line and we've also got the

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.330 
original line and we've also got the
minus<00:03:04.500> or<00:03:04.650> plus<00:03:05.450> for<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:06.599> the<00:03:07.079> line<00:03:07.349> itself

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
minus or plus for the the line itself

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.890 
minus or plus for the the line itself
the<00:03:08.609> distance<00:03:09.000> how<00:03:09.150> far<00:03:09.389> it<00:03:09.510> is<00:03:09.540> from<00:03:09.599> the

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
the distance how far it is from the

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.690 
the distance how far it is from the
original<00:03:10.260> line<00:03:10.470> so<00:03:11.220> we've<00:03:11.340> also<00:03:11.430> got<00:03:11.670> another

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
original line so we've also got another

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.680 
original line so we've also got another
tool<00:03:12.090> where<00:03:12.209> I<00:03:12.239> can<00:03:12.420> create<00:03:12.720> another<00:03:13.370> so<00:03:14.370> this

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
tool where I can create another so this

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.720 
tool where I can create another so this
creates<00:03:15.690> me<00:03:15.840> another<00:03:16.049> line<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:16.560> is<00:03:17.069> minus

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
creates me another line that is minus

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.780 
creates me another line that is minus
nine<00:03:17.940> so<00:03:18.209> again<00:03:18.510> so<00:03:19.349> I<00:03:19.379> can<00:03:19.620> again<00:03:19.889> go<00:03:20.220> plus<00:03:20.489> or

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
nine so again so I can again go plus or

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.640 
nine so again so I can again go plus or
minus<00:03:21.239> from<00:03:21.989> the<00:03:22.139> original<00:03:22.560> line<00:03:22.739> okay<00:03:24.650> okay

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
minus from the original line okay okay

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.710 
minus from the original line okay okay
so<00:03:25.709> that<00:03:25.919> is<00:03:25.949> the<00:03:26.129> offset<00:03:26.549> line<00:03:26.819> tool<00:03:27.239> dialog

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
so that is the offset line tool dialog

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.869 
so that is the offset line tool dialog
box<00:03:28.370> and<00:03:30.290> that<00:03:31.290> is<00:03:31.440> what's<00:03:31.889> new<00:03:32.190> for<00:03:32.639> the

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 
box and that is what's new for the

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.750 
box and that is what's new for the
design<00:03:33.419> lines
