there you've got your basic graphics
your<00:00:36.540> data<00:00:36.960> amenities<00:00:37.470> hey<00:00:38.100> how<00:00:38.250> does

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:38.310 
your data amenities hey how does

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.100 
your data amenities hey how does
geometry<00:00:39.120> show<00:00:39.360> up<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:39.870> where<00:00:40.050> it

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
geometry show up so this is where it

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.040 
geometry show up so this is where it
comes<00:00:40.260> up<00:00:40.440> with<00:00:40.620> all<00:00:40.800> those<00:00:40.980> colors<00:00:41.570> now<00:00:42.570> under

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
graphics to the right hand side is

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.870 
graphics to the right hand side is
background<00:00:45.930> now<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:47.010> can<00:00:47.160> change<00:00:47.400> the<00:00:47.670> color

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:47.880

background now you can change the color
here<00:00:48.000> let's<00:00:48.329> just<00:00:48.480> pick<00:00:48.660> something<00:00:48.900> solid<00:00:49.290> to

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
here let's just pick something solid to

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.150 
here let's just pick something solid to
start<00:00:49.829> with<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:51.110> you<00:00:52.110> get<00:00:52.800> something<00:00:53.100> that

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
start with and you get something that

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.790 
start with and you get something that
looks<00:00:53.460> like<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.960> pretty<00:00:54.960> decent<00:00:55.470> little<00:00:55.680> a

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
looks like that pretty decent little a

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.190 
looks like that pretty decent little a
little<00:00:56.250> better<00:00:56.430> contrast<00:00:57.060> you<00:00:57.480> can<00:00:57.660> also<00:00:57.810> go

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
little better contrast you can also go

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.810 
little better contrast you can also go
to<00:00:58.230> an<00:00:58.560> older-style<00:01:00.260> gradient<00:01:01.260> background

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
to an older-style gradient background

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.630 
to an older-style gradient background
where<00:01:02.820> let's<00:01:03.030> uncheck<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.840> no<00:01:03.989> gradient

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
where let's uncheck the no gradient

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.620 
where let's uncheck the no gradient
resets<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.790> colors<00:01:06.180> now<00:01:07.170> we<00:01:07.229> can<00:01:07.500> go<00:01:07.680> in<00:01:07.890> and

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
resets the colors now we can go in and

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.940 
resets the colors now we can go in and
play<00:01:09.630> around<00:01:09.659> with<00:01:10.080> okay<00:01:10.530> what<00:01:10.680> do<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.770> want

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
you've still got a version of wildfire

that<00:02:59.760> still<00:03:00.120> had<00:03:00.300> this<00:03:00.510> pulldown<00:03:00.930> right<00:03:01.230> here

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
that still had this pulldown right here

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.270 
that still had this pulldown right here
for<00:03:02.640> pre<00:03:03.090> wildfire<00:03:03.800> another<00:03:04.800> thing<00:03:05.010> you<00:03:05.130> want

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
for pre wildfire another thing you want

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.820 
for pre wildfire another thing you want
to<00:03:05.430> do<00:03:05.520> is<00:03:05.700> it<00:03:05.850> has<00:03:05.880> pre<00:03:06.600> wildfire<00:03:07.320> entity

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
to do is it has pre wildfire entity

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.280 
to do is it has pre wildfire entity
mappings<00:03:08.340> so<00:03:08.550> that<00:03:09.060> basically<00:03:09.510> is<00:03:09.840> what

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
mappings so that basically is what

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.110 
mappings so that basically is what
changes<00:03:10.740> the<00:03:10.890> color<00:03:11.100> of<00:03:11.190> datum<00:03:11.610> planes<00:03:11.880> and

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
changes the color of datum planes and

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.390 
changes the color of datum planes and
such<00:03:12.330> pre<00:03:13.110> wildfires<00:03:13.710> the<00:03:13.950> rest<00:03:14.130> of<00:03:14.310> the

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
such pre wildfires the rest of the

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.030 
such pre wildfires the rest of the
scheme<00:03:14.870> so<00:03:15.870> you<00:03:15.960> can<00:03:16.080> say<00:03:16.230> I<00:03:16.260> want<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:16.560> use<00:03:16.620> pre

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
scheme so you can say I want to use pre

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.940 
scheme so you can say I want to use pre
wildfire<00:03:17.790> entity<00:03:18.150> colors<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:18.780> I<00:03:19.650> want<00:03:19.800> to<00:03:19.860> go

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
wildfire entity colors and I want to go

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.830 
wildfire entity colors and I want to go
to<00:03:20.010> pre<00:03:20.250> wildfire<00:03:20.790> scheme<00:03:21.180> there's<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.570> old

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
to pre wildfire scheme there's the old

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.100 
to pre wildfire scheme there's the old
scheme<00:03:22.320> we<00:03:22.500> all<00:03:22.770> know<00:03:23.010> and<00:03:23.220> love<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:23.640> you<00:03:24.110> can

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
scheme we all know and love and you can

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.240 
scheme we all know and love and you can
say<00:03:25.380> save<00:03:26.010> this<00:03:26.250> off<00:03:26.550> as<00:03:26.850> a<00:03:27.440> system<00:03:28.440> color<00:03:28.920> file

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
say save this off as a system color file

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.140 
say save this off as a system color file
again<00:03:30.020> once<00:03:31.020> you<00:03:31.230> have<00:03:31.440> that<00:03:31.680> saved<00:03:32.010> off<00:03:32.280> you

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
again once you have that saved off you

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.230 
again once you have that saved off you
can<00:03:33.360> apply<00:03:33.690> that<00:03:33.720> to<00:03:34.020> creo<00:03:34.700> the<00:03:35.700> same<00:03:35.970> way<00:03:36.180> you

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
can apply that to creo the same way you

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.120 
can apply that to creo the same way you
can<00:03:36.510> with<00:03:36.690> any<00:03:36.900> other<00:03:37.140> file<00:03:37.470> so<00:03:37.830> I've<00:03:37.950> saved

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
can with any other file so I've saved

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.910 
can with any other file so I've saved
that<00:03:38.250> one<00:03:38.520> off<00:03:38.840> you<00:03:39.840> would<00:03:40.020> use<00:03:40.260> this<00:03:40.440> config

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
that one off you would use this config

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.660 
that one off you would use this config
option<00:03:41.460> to<00:03:42.150> point<00:03:42.480> to<00:03:42.630> that<00:03:42.780> new<00:03:43.440> file<00:03:43.770> but

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
option to point to that new file but

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:45.800 
option to point to that new file but
here's<00:03:44.880> what<00:03:45.030> it<00:03:45.060> looks<00:03:45.330> like

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
here's what it looks like

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.230 
here's what it looks like
and<00:03:46.650> let's<00:03:46.890> just<00:03:46.950> load<00:03:47.310> that<00:03:47.340> right<00:03:47.790> now<00:03:47.940> go<00:03:48.180> to

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240 
and let's just load that right now go to

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.550 
and let's just load that right now go to
options<00:03:49.400> go<00:03:50.400> to<00:03:50.460> system<00:03:50.940> colors<00:03:51.350> and<00:03:52.350> I've<00:03:52.440> got

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
options go to system colors and I've got

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.060 
options go to system colors and I've got
a<00:03:52.590> browse<00:03:52.890> button<00:03:53.250> to<00:03:53.340> load<00:03:53.670> a<00:03:53.700> file<00:03:54.410> and<00:03:55.410> let's
