she<00:01:30.780> never<00:01:30.960> goes<00:01:31.140> negative<00:01:31.409> she<00:01:31.740> never<00:01:31.920> dies

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
she never goes negative she never dies

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.190 
she never goes negative she never dies
oh<00:01:32.430> my<00:01:32.579> god<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:32.790> killed<00:01:32.909> her<00:01:33.270> she's<00:01:33.869> immortal

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
oh my god I killed her she's immortal

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.410 
oh my god I killed her she's immortal
like<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.829> die<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.460> know<00:01:35.790> it's<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.119> video<00:01:36.240> game

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
like I die you know it's a video game

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.990 
like I die you know it's a video game
and<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:37.070> guess<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.189> just<00:01:38.220> wanted<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.670> bring<00:01:38.850> this

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
and I guess I just wanted to bring this

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.270 
and I guess I just wanted to bring this
up<00:01:39.150> for<00:01:39.360> discussion<00:01:39.570> just<00:01:40.229> because<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:41.070> feel

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
up for discussion just because I feel

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.969 
up for discussion just because I feel
like<00:01:41.640> because<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.180> movement<00:01:42.450> added<00:01:43.140> into

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
like because of the movement added into

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.889 
like because of the movement added into
advanced<00:01:44.520> warfare<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.119> core<00:01:45.390> mechanics

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
advanced warfare and the core mechanics

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.469 
advanced warfare and the core mechanics
of<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.310> makes<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.610> more<00:01:47.790> difficult<00:01:48.060> call

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
of that makes it a more difficult call

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.450 
of that makes it a more difficult call
of<00:01:48.600> duty<00:01:48.810> because<00:01:48.930> it's<00:01:49.200> not<00:01:49.350> just<00:01:49.409> like<00:01:49.920> Amon

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
of duty because it's not just like Amon

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.850 
of duty because it's not just like Amon
shoot<00:01:50.700> anymore<00:01:50.939> it's<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.299> maneuver<00:01:52.229> shoot<00:01:52.619> out

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
shoot anymore it's a maneuver shoot out

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.560 
shoot anymore it's a maneuver shoot out
maneuver<00:01:53.340> your<00:01:53.460> opponent<00:01:53.970> shoot<00:01:54.360> at<00:01:54.479> your

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
maneuver your opponent shoot at your

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.780 
maneuver your opponent shoot at your
opponent<00:01:55.229> who<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.530> maneuvering<00:01:56.159> themselves

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
opponent who is maneuvering themselves

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.850 
opponent who is maneuvering themselves
and<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.630> makes<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:57.990> really<00:01:58.170> interesting<00:01:58.259> to

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
and that makes it really interesting to

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.399 
and that makes it really interesting to
me<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.159> now<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.659> don't<00:02:00.659> think<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:00.990> have<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.140> best

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
me and now I don't think I have the best

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.109 
me and now I don't think I have the best
gun<00:02:01.680> skill<00:02:01.979> in<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.159> world<00:02:02.340> especially<00:02:02.549> if<00:02:03.030> you

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
gun skill in the world especially if you

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.850 
gun skill in the world especially if you
I<00:02:03.450> don't<00:02:03.869> even<00:02:03.930> want<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.170> be<00:02:04.259> compared<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.710> pro

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
I don't even want to be compared to pro

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.010 
I don't even want to be compared to pro
players<00:02:05.159> but<00:02:05.430> pro<00:02:06.000> players<00:02:06.420> have<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.780> best

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
players but pro players have the best

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.889 
players but pro players have the best
guns<00:02:07.350> feel<00:02:07.590> I<00:02:07.619> think<00:02:07.950> in<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.160> world

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
guns feel I think in the world

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.199 
guns feel I think in the world
and<00:02:09.019> my<00:02:09.530> gun<00:02:09.799> skills<00:02:10.069> it's<00:02:10.369> okay<00:02:10.759> you<00:02:11.120> know

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
and my gun skills it's okay you know

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.569 
and my gun skills it's okay you know
it's<00:02:11.420> more<00:02:11.780> about<00:02:11.870> positioning<00:02:12.650> on<00:02:12.890> yourself

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:13.579 
it's more about positioning on yourself

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:15.160 
it's more about positioning on yourself
on<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:13.790> map<00:02:13.939> and<00:02:14.150> getting<00:02:14.420> too<00:02:14.540> hot<00:02:14.720> spots

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
on the map and getting too hot spots

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.039 
on the map and getting too hot spots
like<00:02:15.439> I<00:02:15.590> am<00:02:15.709> in<00:02:15.860> this<00:02:15.980> gameplay<00:02:16.629> but<00:02:17.629> I<00:02:17.689> think

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
like I am in this gameplay but I think

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.350 
like I am in this gameplay but I think
coupled<00:02:18.530> like<00:02:18.769> with<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.129> movement<00:02:19.400> and<00:02:19.790> I

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
coupled like with the movement and I

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.509 
coupled like with the movement and I
can't<00:02:21.049> really<00:02:21.170> say<00:02:21.530> too<00:02:21.590> much<00:02:21.950> about<00:02:22.010> skill

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
can't really say too much about skill

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.580 
can't really say too much about skill
based<00:02:22.700> matchmaking<00:02:22.939> because<00:02:23.569> I<00:02:23.599> honestly

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
based matchmaking because I honestly

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.800 
based matchmaking because I honestly
don't<00:02:24.829> know<00:02:25.010> I'm<00:02:25.549> not<00:02:25.609> a<00:02:25.879> developer<00:02:26.239> I<00:02:26.480> don't

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
don't know I'm not a developer I don't

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.630 
don't know I'm not a developer I don't
have<00:02:26.930> access<00:02:27.109> to<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:27.620> stats<00:02:27.950> and<00:02:28.280> like<00:02:28.400> all

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
have access to the stats and like all

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.030 
have access to the stats and like all
the<00:02:28.790> things<00:02:29.060> that<00:02:29.359> that<00:02:30.109> exists<00:02:30.530> in<00:02:30.709> the<00:02:30.829> game

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
the things that that exists in the game

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.099 
the things that that exists in the game
as<00:02:31.250> far<00:02:31.430> as<00:02:31.579> matchmaking<00:02:32.180> and<00:02:32.599> I<00:02:32.900> know<00:02:32.989> they

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:33.109 
as far as matchmaking and I know they

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:34.599 
as far as matchmaking and I know they
did<00:02:33.319> just<00:02:33.530> like<00:02:33.829> yesterday<00:02:34.069> they<00:02:34.430> made<00:02:34.579> a

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:34.609 
did just like yesterday they made a

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:36.670 
did just like yesterday they made a
patch<00:02:34.939> where<00:02:35.269> they<00:02:35.359> said<00:02:35.599> they<00:02:35.750> improved<00:02:36.290> upon

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
patch where they said they improved upon

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.039 
patch where they said they improved upon
the<00:02:36.920> matchmaking<00:02:37.540> which<00:02:38.540> I<00:02:38.689> don't<00:02:38.750> know<00:02:38.930> if

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
the matchmaking which I don't know if

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.530 
the matchmaking which I don't know if
that<00:02:39.260> puts<00:02:39.590> us<00:02:39.799> in<00:02:40.040> better<00:02:40.459> connection<00:02:41.239> games

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
that puts us in better connection games

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.479 
that puts us in better connection games
or<00:02:41.959> I<00:02:41.989> don't<00:02:42.260> even<00:02:42.379> know<00:02:42.650> how<00:02:42.859> skill<00:02:43.310> based

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
or I don't even know how skill based

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.089 
or I don't even know how skill based
matchmaking<00:02:43.730> works<00:02:44.389> so<00:02:44.720> my<00:02:44.930> theory<00:02:45.680> this<00:02:45.950> is

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:46.099 
matchmaking works so my theory this is

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.759 
matchmaking works so my theory this is
only<00:02:46.250> a<00:02:46.340> theory<00:02:46.579> this<00:02:46.760> is<00:02:46.909> in<00:02:47.060> fact<00:02:47.440> my<00:02:48.440> theory

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
only a theory this is in fact my theory

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.589 
only a theory this is in fact my theory
is<00:02:48.920> that<00:02:49.010> scored<00:02:49.760> per<00:02:49.940> minute<00:02:50.239> is<00:02:50.359> what

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
is that scored per minute is what

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:53.379 
is that scored per minute is what
dictates<00:02:51.069> and<00:02:52.069> prestige<00:02:52.730> probably<00:02:53.239> what

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:53.389 
dictates and prestige probably what

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:55.869 
dictates and prestige probably what
dictates<00:02:53.870> you're<00:02:54.769> the<00:02:55.129> kind<00:02:55.370> of<00:02:55.430> lobbies<00:02:55.760> you

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:55.879 
dictates you're the kind of lobbies you

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:58.509 
dictates you're the kind of lobbies you
get<00:02:56.030> into<00:02:56.239> that's<00:02:56.540> just<00:02:56.810> in<00:02:57.019> my<00:02:57.139> experience<00:02:57.889> my

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
get into that's just in my experience my

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.490 
get into that's just in my experience my
KD<00:02:58.819> is<00:02:59.120> actually<00:02:59.510> not<00:02:59.629> that<00:02:59.689> good<00:03:00.109> i<00:03:00.139> only<00:03:00.409> have

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
KD is actually not that good i only have

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.220 
KD is actually not that good i only have
like<00:03:00.530> a<00:03:00.650> 1.3<00:03:01.540> just<00:03:02.540> because<00:03:02.720> i<00:03:02.780> do<00:03:02.840> put<00:03:03.109> like<00:03:03.200> a

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
like a 1.3 just because i do put like a

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.259 
like a 1.3 just because i do put like a
lot<00:03:03.409> of<00:03:03.500> ranked<00:03:03.799> play<00:03:04.069> and<00:03:04.519> just<00:03:04.730> some<00:03:05.090> like

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
lot of ranked play and just some like

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:06.729 
lot of ranked play and just some like
sometimes<00:03:05.659> i<00:03:05.780> don't<00:03:05.840> have<00:03:06.139> good<00:03:06.319> Reaper<00:03:06.650> all
