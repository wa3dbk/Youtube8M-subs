00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.540
 Talk guys here is the caps ice and well. 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.429
 coming but a video the ultimate team 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.889
 In this video I ended up buying time of 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.440
 the year marcelo vieira i played like 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.289
 dpj with his left half right 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.090
 on my team and unfortunately it was not 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.369
 as good as I imagined I 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.380
 more wanted so is good as the defender 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.880
 like left back I did not like it 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.269
 much of it to play as left half 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.279
 in quite different compensation for daniel 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.980
 and I think it 's a lot more killer like 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.600
 right-hander is not playing as add 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.190
 playing half right can do 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.540
 good with dani alves 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.540
 so if you have the money to play the 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.790
 Marcelo daniel alves or as add or the 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.950
 and I suggest you put daniel because 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.809
 He sends you very well. 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.940
 right leg is always fine 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.200
 positioned and ends well 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.390
 already marcelo despite having a good control 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.250
 be more defensive of the ball . 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.980
 that Daniel I do not think he catches 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.600
 very well on the ball is so not at least 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.030
 did not work very well on my team myself 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.100
 I prefer marcelo as lateral side 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.780
 left and I prefer daniel alves as 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.400
 half right because we had as 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.490
 right side and ends up running away 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.920
 from the back and can often leave you 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.840
 on the other hand but the team also has 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.040
 several good players who get out 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.600
 complete the team 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.310
 beyond those goals and took are daniel 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.350
 alves has to see that he made some in 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.670
 several decisive moments for me are 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.250
 between players who had already said 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.780
 before lucas lucas he is very similar 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.100
 with neymar but is a bit stronger 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.990
 here is also a bit more difficult and 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.430
 lose the ball he can make good 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.640
 goals that do not even end with a 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.659
 Very good knock then Lucas. 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.700
 regardless of the team you pick it up 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.710
 to be able to fit in as French 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.060
 Brazilian, whatever it is, it 's a 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.240
 very complete player 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.060
 it's worth having on the team outside that 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.920
 People also have the ranking or mrm remick 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.540
 speaks not sure how was the name 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.490
 his because he is French has an accent 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.180
 he in the middle, each one pronounces the way 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.320
 what you want 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.899
 but regardless of this is an excellent 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.860
 player now at barclays like i said 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.229
 Last day 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.329
 you will have the option to put it on 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.490
 other is and with other teams is because the 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.079
 French team can put together a good 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.119
 time but does not have a reservation bank 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.250
 very good in another move by lucas 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.920
 also riding every move casting 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.850
 o sending prohibited will hereby Pro 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.710
 year 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.000
 remy and with a rather strange position but 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.650
 Can you do the goal? 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.140
 one thing I ask you if you 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.450
 they know how to turn the ball in a corner 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.240
 You noticed, but if that goal in 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.380
 particular the ball made a curve 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.300
 gigantic is something that has me 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.220
 helped in the corner and did not 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.750
 he does a lot of cornering and 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.530
 afterwards he also began to blame the 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.230
 ball 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.340
 the business started a lot is to see if 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.010
 was to blame the ball without having 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.210
 players with a lot of koff but then 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.460
 We're talking about another video if you have 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.440
 interest and I also want to say that the 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.510
 ibra is very good for nodding 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.920
 I do not know if they fixed the angle now in the 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.200
 replay will be a little better for 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.190
 see him when the head nods more quietly 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.470
 in my life it was a strange goldfish 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.990
 on the belly of the face very extreme still 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.300
 so showed how good it is and then 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.280
 He is not very good with his left leg. 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.690
 but in compensation he looks where he went 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.810
 pick up this ball again by bouncing 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.850
 curve he jumped higher than the goalie 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:12.600
 I repeat the ibra jumped higher than the 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.100
 goalkeeper and sent that exceptional goal r 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.470
 as I said in the previous video can 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.840
 have seen another goal make head 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.300
 but in this I can make several goals 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.560
 head was also this other 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.600
 head but only to show the 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.430
 positioning is the ibra despite having 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.620
 been exceptional head very well 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.360
 and legal position of ibram that 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.560
 He is very good at tracking what now. 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.390
 got a penalty 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.270
 another video lets me done I just 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.650
 Wrong but this one I forgave 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.510
 now they are varying slightly the 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.240
 benefits and I do not know if it 's a bit 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.920
 spotted sending the ball up but I 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.970
 I have a variety to know a little 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.920
 more chance 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.690
 now I'll show you some bids 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.850
 to show more his strength is this 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.020
 three guys on top of him goes all over 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.290
 world and make the goal 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:58.290
 his strength is summed up with skill and 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.990
 ball control and the speed 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.490
 though low the pace farmer do 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.560
 an exceptional player 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:08.400
 once again the positioning of the team is 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.770
 very perfect and is at the moment one of the 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.750
 good players missing the jackson who 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.490
 had already shown in previous videos 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.230
 no ischemia of how to beat lack that I 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.630
 I taught before I just told myself exactly 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:21.570
 aligned with the barrier two bars of 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:24.330
 goal force then this goal up 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.500
 was almost the year was good and I found that 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.690
 the jet be my body 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.330
 The only goal I missed is that I ended up seeing 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.670
 that Jackson is not the only player in the 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.580
 team to beat foul believe if you want 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.810
 the tear remove tite is an excellent 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.100
 player 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.480
 although for that she can if the goal 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.850
 I do not know why not continue sharing 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.280
 he is to make a heel goal but out 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.290
 This I was putting the book was already 3 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.630
 to 0 and test it and I discovered that it 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.210
 he hit very well on the ball and got 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.680
 so an exceptional sight that neither 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.520
 You could see that ball hit the crossbar. 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.290
 before entering 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.820
 It was a really good free kick. 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.919
 Time that I do not do a little bit some 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.680
 goals in that match and get 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:03.720
 do two then it was pretty cool that goal 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.350
 you can see that he was practically in the 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.550
 angle 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.680
 I do not think even the best goalkeeper of the 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.180
 world could get this ball and I 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.370
 I like to win place because I showed 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.470
 perfect the ball to the box 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.750
 Other than that, I also wanted to enjoy 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:18.150
 to show a last goal of the ibra 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.130
 show what this resume is about 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.440
 summarized that in the video he ibrai 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.540
 simply has strength gets august 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.030
 of the world and the traditional dribble 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:29.400
 Look at this other than it has led to 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.750
 half the team on the shoulder on it goes there 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.610
 can give a dribble with a lot of 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.530
 accuracy within the large area and 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:38.150
 Finally and very category making 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.660
 ball and I suggest and the perfect ending 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.600
 indefensible 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:45.090
 So it's two more bids just to 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.970
 Finish two very quiet tips 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:50.790
 and also beyond the power of the of all still 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:52.650
 has this finesse this almost 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.200
 delicacy to send the ball to the bottom 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.669
 of the network he is not a player 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.890
 disbursed as usually happens with 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:00.870
 several players who are very strong are 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:02.400
 a very strong player very tall and he 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.250
 ends up being haggard here in 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.260
 balotelli he is half disengaged but 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.100
 I still think the book is very 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.810
 best 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.330
 and to finish showing the butt of the 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.460
 maikon milk for me to bridge to 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.890
 my brazil team will see I'll show 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:18.150
 The sequence of a brazil is Brazilian hexa 

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:20.070
 silver 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.540
 but before that I just wanted to say that 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:25.320
 if you really are the best team I have ever 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:27.000
 I played with him and I think I played three 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.250
 campi three seasons in the first 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.560
 division and I won three championships 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:33.830
 followed and only had a defeat that in the 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.940
 It really is not a suck because 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.500
 It was the one that might be that I think 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.120
 The game that I won 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.700
 internet something similar to my 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:44.010
 home and it was very messy so I'm going 

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:47.670
 show now both feet quickly 

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:48.900
 about my two teams there than the two 

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:53.400
 seasons that I did with the 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:55.950
 ibram the vit and galera and to finish I 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.480
 I'm going to show you this my Brazil team now. 

00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:00.030
 to see is a team that was very interesting 

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:02.040
 but as I said unfortunately I did not find 

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:03.450
 plenty of room to play so that 

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.070
 it turned out to be a bit boring 

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.870
 because he could only play with players 

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.700
 gold and as much as the team is good 

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.840
 evident that the gold players will 

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.850
 always play better 

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:14.940
 This team has Adrian's eyes are 

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:15.930
 maikon milk has is jucilei has several 

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.610
 good players 

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:19.110
 I just put the left-hand sides of 

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:21.510
 rights that I know have players in 

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:24.930
 Dribble because I do not like it very much. 

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:26.310
 training 4 12 12 I think for 

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:27.630
 this team needs to be very defensive 

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:29.400
 because I knew I was going to get opponents 

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:31.200
 most difficult to play please show 

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.240
 some bids later on the next video 

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:35.010
 my team to whistle and I hope that 

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:40.100
 they have tanned here is like 

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:40.100
