00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
to play a career mode but still i

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.350 
to play a career mode but still i
personally<00:01:54.899> would<00:01:55.350> love<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.950> lot<00:01:55.979> more<00:01:56.399> when

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
personally would love it a lot more when

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.420 
personally would love it a lot more when
it<00:01:57.479> would<00:01:57.689> be<00:01:57.719> on<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.439> manager<00:01:58.920> career<00:01:59.219> mode

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
it would be on the manager career mode

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.780 
it would be on the manager career mode
because<00:01:59.670> that<00:02:00.540> would<00:02:00.840> open<00:02:01.079> up<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.799> big<00:02:02.460> whole

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
because that would open up a big whole

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.050

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.770 
freaking excited for story mode to come
into<00:03:46.680> any<00:03:47.130> game<00:03:47.519> because<00:03:48.180> I<00:03:48.209> would<00:03:48.480> love<00:03:48.720> to

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
into any game because I would love to

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.530 
into any game because I would love to
have<00:03:49.080> it<00:03:49.290> on<00:03:49.380> let's<00:03:50.250> say<00:03:50.430> fucking<00:03:50.940> madden<00:03:51.420> or

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
have it on let's say fucking madden or

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.949 
have it on let's say fucking madden or
MBA<00:03:52.470> because<00:03:52.920> that<00:03:53.100> means<00:03:53.340> that<00:03:53.700> one<00:03:54.209> day<00:03:54.450> they

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
MBA because that means that one day they

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.320 
MBA because that means that one day they
are<00:03:54.989> going<00:03:55.470> to<00:03:55.590> be<00:03:55.830> doing<00:03:56.010> it<00:03:56.310> for<00:03:56.670> FIFA<00:03:57.150> as

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
are going to be doing it for FIFA as

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.240 
are going to be doing it for FIFA as
well<00:03:57.570> because<00:03:57.930> it's<00:03:58.110> their<00:03:58.350> most<00:03:58.590> selling

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
well because it's their most selling

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.580 
well because it's their most selling
game<00:03:59.519> and<00:03:59.790> it's<00:04:00.150> obvious<00:04:00.390> that<00:04:00.720> everyone

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
game and it's obvious that everyone

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.250 
game and it's obvious that everyone
would<00:04:01.920> like<00:04:02.160> to<00:04:02.400> have<00:04:02.610> that<00:04:02.850> on<00:04:03.180> FIFA<00:04:03.810> as<00:04:03.989> well

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
would like to have that on FIFA as well

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.560 
would like to have that on FIFA as well
and<00:04:04.739> I<00:04:04.830> don't<00:04:05.100> think<00:04:05.340> it<00:04:05.519> would<00:04:05.700> take<00:04:05.730> too<00:04:06.330> long

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
and I don't think it would take too long

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.920 
and I don't think it would take too long
for<00:04:06.870> EA<00:04:07.350> to<00:04:07.530> realize<00:04:08.220> that<00:04:08.519> we<00:04:08.700> want<00:04:08.940> it<00:04:09.180> into
