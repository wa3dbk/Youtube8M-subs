tougher than it is in the single player
and<00:00:41.079> I<00:00:42.079> succeeds<00:00:45.070> yeah<00:00:46.070> and<00:00:47.500> okay<00:00:48.500> one<00:00:48.920> become

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
shield can you explain a bit more about

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.190 
shield can you explain a bit more about
that<00:04:54.520> so<00:04:55.680> when<00:04:56.680> when<00:04:56.980> you<00:04:57.010> pick<00:04:57.280> up<00:04:57.400> money<00:04:58.200> you
