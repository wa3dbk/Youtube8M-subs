00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
some of the ideas behind the game you

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.680 
some of the ideas behind the game you
know<00:01:17.310> there's<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.610> lot<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:17.940> core<00:01:18.149> concepts

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
know there's a lot of the core concepts

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.389 
know there's a lot of the core concepts
still<00:01:18.930> in<00:01:19.049> place<00:01:19.289> and<00:01:19.619> there<00:01:19.950> but<00:01:20.100> they're<00:01:20.280> all

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:20.399 
still in place and there but they're all

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:22.219 
still in place and there but they're all
made<00:01:20.610> more<00:01:20.820> intuitive<00:01:21.360> more<00:01:21.600> realistic<00:01:22.140> and

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
made more intuitive more realistic and

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.730 
made more intuitive more realistic and

on<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.009> core<00:01:26.190> game<00:01:26.460> by<00:01:26.670> adding<00:01:26.850> more<00:01:27.119> features

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
on the core game by adding more features

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.050 
on the core game by adding more features
and<00:01:27.780> increasing<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.440> complexity<00:01:28.979> by<00:01:29.759> adding

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
and increasing the complexity by adding

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.820 
and increasing the complexity by adding
layers<00:01:30.300> but<00:01:30.720> there<00:01:31.259> were<00:01:31.350> only<00:01:31.409> small

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
layers but there were only small

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.279 
layers but there were only small
improvements<00:01:32.429> in<00:01:32.550> terms<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:33.289> presentation

this<00:01:34.770> time<00:01:35.039> the<00:01:35.190> whole<00:01:35.310> thing<00:01:35.340> has<00:01:35.640> been

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
this time the whole thing has been

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.700 
this time the whole thing has been
redone<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.840> make<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.140> much<00:01:37.319> more<00:01:37.590> accessible

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
redone to make it much more accessible

and<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:39.119> know<00:01:39.240> streamlined<00:01:39.929> so<00:01:40.200> people<00:01:40.470> can

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
and you know streamlined so people can

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.169 
and you know streamlined so people can
really<00:01:40.770> get<00:01:40.950> into<00:01:41.190> it<00:01:41.340> easily<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.940> start

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:42.179 
really get into it easily and start

really get into it easily and start
playing<00:01:42.509> without<00:01:42.750> having<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.289> worry<00:01:43.470> about<00:01:43.530> a

playing without having to worry about a
lot<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.220> crap<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.000> came<00:01:45.330> along<00:01:45.539> with<00:01:45.600> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
lot of the crap that came along with the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.930 
lot of the crap that came along with the
first<00:01:46.050> do<00:01:46.259> one<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.399> things<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.789> makes

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
first do one of the things that makes

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.300 
first do one of the things that makes
that<00:01:48.179> so<00:01:48.630> much<00:01:48.780> more<00:01:48.960> easy<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.860> interface

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
that so much more easy is the interface

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.940 
that so much more easy is the interface
it<00:01:50.580> provides<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:51.119> lot<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.569> data<00:01:51.750> in<00:01:51.929> a<00:01:52.020> very<00:01:52.049> less

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
it provides a lot of data in a very less

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.219 
it provides a lot of data in a very less
obtrusive<00:01:53.129> format<00:01:53.849> it<00:01:54.450> looks<00:01:54.629> similar<00:01:54.899> at<00:01:55.170> a

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
obtrusive format it looks similar at a

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.410 
obtrusive format it looks similar at a
first<00:01:55.410> glance<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:56.090> previous<00:01:57.090> games<00:01:57.300> but

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
first glance to previous games but

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.419 
first glance to previous games but
you'll<00:01:57.660> find<00:01:58.560> improvements<00:01:59.160> nearly

00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.429 
you'll find improvements nearly

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:02.119 
you'll find improvements nearly
everywhere<00:01:59.819> you<00:02:00.000> turn<00:02:00.179> in<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.899> past<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.979> had

everywhere you turn in the past you had

00:02:02.129 --> 00:02:03.680 
everywhere you turn in the past you had
to<00:02:02.160> know<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.459> output<00:02:02.610> of<00:02:02.879> each<00:02:03.000> terrain<00:02:03.420> type

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
to know the output of each terrain type

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.419 
to know the output of each terrain type
now<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.080> just<00:02:04.289> get<00:02:04.440> to<00:02:04.560> see<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.770> productivity

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429 
now you just get to see the productivity

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:07.190 
now you just get to see the productivity
right<00:02:05.640> on<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.849> map<00:02:06.119> because<00:02:07.050> there's

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
right on the map because there's

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.229 
right on the map because there's
overlays<00:02:07.679> you<00:02:07.979> can<00:02:08.250> click<00:02:08.520> on<00:02:08.640> little<00:02:08.910> buttons

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
overlays you can click on little buttons

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.639 
overlays you can click on little buttons
that<00:02:09.450> will<00:02:09.569> show<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:09.899> all<00:02:10.020> where<00:02:10.349> all<00:02:10.440> your

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
that will show you all where all your

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.040 
that will show you all where all your
units<00:02:11.009> are<00:02:11.160> on<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.790> map<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.540> know<00:02:12.900> it's

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
units are on the map and you know it's

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.000 
units are on the map and you know it's
just<00:02:13.140> little<00:02:13.410> things<00:02:13.530> like<00:02:13.650> this<00:02:13.950> that

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
just little things like this that

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.890 
just little things like this that
actually<00:02:14.340> make<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.730> game<00:02:14.970> that<00:02:15.000> much<00:02:15.450> easier

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
actually make the game that much easier

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.290 
actually make the game that much easier
to<00:02:15.930> deal<00:02:16.230> with<00:02:16.519> at<00:02:17.519> the<00:02:17.670> core<00:02:17.849> of<00:02:17.879> the<00:02:18.000> game<00:02:18.090> as

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
to deal with at the core of the game as

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.390 
to deal with at the core of the game as
usual<00:02:18.720> is<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.319> fact<00:02:19.739> that<00:02:19.830> you<00:02:19.980> start<00:02:20.280> off

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
usual is the fact that you start off

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.960 
usual is the fact that you start off
with<00:02:20.700> a<00:02:20.730> little<00:02:20.940> settler<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.080> maybe<00:02:22.440> a

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
with a little settler and maybe a

is you know

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.180 
is you know
I<00:05:13.270> think<00:05:13.690> the<00:05:13.780> sieve<00:05:13.960> team<00:05:14.139> refers<00:05:14.800> to<00:05:14.830> it<00:05:15.069> as<00:05:15.160> a

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
I think the sieve team refers to it as a

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.339 
I think the sieve team refers to it as a
culture<00:05:15.550> bomb<00:05:15.699> because<00:05:16.449> if<00:05:16.660> you<00:05:16.810> if<00:05:17.050> you<00:05:17.229> have

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:17.349 
culture bomb because if you if you have

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:18.779 
culture bomb because if you if you have
a<00:05:17.380> city<00:05:17.620> right<00:05:17.860> next<00:05:18.099> door<00:05:18.130> to<00:05:18.250> another<00:05:18.550> city

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:18.789 
a city right next door to another city

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:20.279 
a city right next door to another city
with<00:05:18.940> not<00:05:19.150> a<00:05:19.180> lot<00:05:19.360> of<00:05:19.449> culture<00:05:19.780> and<00:05:19.930> you<00:05:19.990> drop

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:20.289 
with not a lot of culture and you drop

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:22.320 
with not a lot of culture and you drop
that<00:05:20.530> artist<00:05:21.160> in<00:05:21.280> there<00:05:21.460> it<00:05:21.669> actually<00:05:22.120> might

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
that artist in there it actually might

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.870 
that artist in there it actually might
surround<00:05:22.960> that<00:05:23.199> other<00:05:23.530> city<00:05:23.830> with<00:05:24.039> with<00:05:24.520> your

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
surround that other city with with your

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.879 
surround that other city with with your
culture<00:05:25.199> meaning<00:05:26.199> that<00:05:26.289> that<00:05:26.440> city<00:05:26.650> might

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:26.889 
culture meaning that that city might

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:28.379 
culture meaning that that city might
actually<00:05:27.069> flip<00:05:27.490> over<00:05:27.669> to<00:05:27.910> you<00:05:28.060> in<00:05:28.210> a<00:05:28.270> little

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:28.389 
actually flip over to you in a little

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:30.360 
actually flip over to you in a little
bit<00:05:28.630> so<00:05:29.410> that's<00:05:29.620> one<00:05:29.860> way<00:05:30.069> of<00:05:30.220> actually

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
bit so that's one way of actually

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.700 
bit so that's one way of actually
promoting<00:05:31.030> a<00:05:31.240> kind<00:05:31.630> of<00:05:31.690> peaceful<00:05:31.990> war<00:05:32.410> on<00:05:32.590> your
