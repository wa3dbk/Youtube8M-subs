00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.580
 ah 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.950
 every horror game has to have a 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.200
 scary sound environment but more 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.509
 it is important that you have a 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.130
 terrifying creatures that make us the 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:35.570
 life impossible in the course of 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:38.090
 game if not I would not have much logic like that 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.950
 that here's a top 10 of the monsters 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:44.090
 more frightening in my opinion 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.090
 number 10 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.640
 when we hear this sound we all know 

00:00:54.429 --> 00:01:00.219
 here we will face if it is the 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.070
 regenerator or iron maiden of the resident 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:05.309
 evil 4 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.680
 and in my opinion this enemy was making 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.870
 lara blood to you at times because 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.680
 his appearance is chilling and his 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:16.229
 hugs are deadly plus the only 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.080
 way to end it is destroying 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.310
 your parasites 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.310
 number 9 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.680
 this enemy persecutes you tirelessly 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:42.380
 for the first saga of proctor games 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:45.500
 It is characteristic for carrying long 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.229
 scissors and the only thing you can do is 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:52.340
 Hide you run away to survive now 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:55.659
 that if you get caught you're finished 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.659
 number 8 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:04.370
 hearing this famous cry everything changes 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:08.360
 of forde ay is that if you have not played 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:11.210
 before this game you might think it's 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.610
 a poor girl sobbing or a 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.400
 poor little girl 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.040
 but do not trust yourself because if you approach 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.530
 you will not have much escape and your 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.470
 Sharp claws will end with you from a 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:27.060
 just touch so let's turn off the flashlight 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.060
 and we are silent 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.799
 number 7 this woman may not be 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.780
 but certainly too scared every time 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:39.379
 that you find her your heart will stop 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.510
 to pump until you get away from it that 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:43.630
 same as the other enemies 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.819
 characteristics of fatal frame 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.730
 number 6 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.950
 this terrifying enemy recognized by 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.620
 your chainsaw and its characteristic head 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.080
 of pig will chase us to make us 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.480
 Hash 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.910
 but we have to hide follow 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.420
 taking away life little by little to be able 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:06.300
 finish him once this is done the 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:10.340
 will flee trying to treat us a trap 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.340
 but we are smarter than 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.189
 Y 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.859
 this wow created by man land is 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:24.980
 recognizable by its long tongue claws 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:28.069
 with blade and it is also a state 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.769
 evolved from zombie which with its 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:33.680
 tongue is able to pierce your chest 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:36.050
 catch you and tear t so have 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.260
 great care 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.959
 number 4 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.629
 this typical silent hill monster 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:46.030
 reflects the personality mentality 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:48.780
 of the protagonist and even the silent 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.680
 hill 4 of the antagonist 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:55.850
 these usually have a sexual meaning 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:04:00.800
 or maybe a fear towards hospitals 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.800
 but this is all according to the protagonist 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.870
 number 3 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.819
 the main antagonist of fear us 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.610
 will make your hair stand on end in various 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:13.010
 moments of the game telling us their 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.739
 tragic story and even if a 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:19.220
 sweet little girl soul has some great 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:22.940
 powers that will make us tremble with fear 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:26.260
 number 2 this mythical antagonist of 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:29.180
 silent hill 2 is characterized by having 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.850
 obviously as its name indicates a 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.860
 pyramidal head and a long knife that 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:37.160
 has dragged the ones I've represented 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:39.080
 as a cruel and violent executioner who 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.900
 appears to those people who are 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.600
 wedding devoured by guilt and feel the 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.670
 need to be punished and is that what 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.540
 We will see continuously until we have 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:52.890
 that we definitely face him 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.890
 number 1 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:21.360
 hearing this and the terrifying music that 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:23.819
 follow the only thing we want will be to hear it and 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.580
 is that this wow was sent by a clock 

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:28.620
 to end the states but if 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.469
 we are brave and we face him 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:34.050
 by stunning it will leave us certain objects 

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:37.630
 that will not be of great help so 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:40.870
