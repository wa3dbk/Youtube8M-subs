and<00:01:08.240> that's<00:01:08.750> pretty<00:01:08.869> much<00:01:08.960> it<00:01:09.049> but<00:01:09.290> regards<00:01:10.280> to

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
and that's pretty much it but regards to

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.649 
and that's pretty much it but regards to
just<00:01:10.610> like<00:01:10.759> the<00:01:10.909> last<00:01:11.030> couple<00:01:11.330> of<00:01:11.450> days<00:01:11.630> I

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
just like the last couple of days I

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:13.719 
just like the last couple of days I
think<00:01:12.380> the<00:01:12.500> key<00:01:12.680> thing<00:01:12.710> for<00:01:12.920> our<00:01:13.070> unit<00:01:13.430> is<00:01:13.520> that

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
think the key thing for our unit is that

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:15.910 
think the key thing for our unit is that
we<00:01:13.909> started<00:01:14.180> in<00:01:14.750> the<00:01:14.840> morn<00:01:15.020> juicing<00:01:15.470> break<00:01:15.710> in
