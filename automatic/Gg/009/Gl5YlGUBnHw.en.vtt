00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
well if you've seen a couple of the

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.860 
well if you've seen a couple of the
smoothie<00:00:02.730> videos<00:00:03.149> that<00:00:03.449> I<00:00:03.480> have<00:00:03.720> out<00:00:03.840> on

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
smoothie videos that I have out on

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.059 
smoothie videos that I have out on
YouTube<00:00:04.290> then<00:00:04.529> you've<00:00:04.650> no<00:00:04.830> doubt<00:00:04.859> noticed

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
YouTube then you've no doubt noticed

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.639 
YouTube then you've no doubt noticed
that<00:00:05.670> I<00:00:05.700> do<00:00:05.879> tend<00:00:06.629> to<00:00:06.810> supplement<00:00:07.529> those

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
that I do tend to supplement those

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.600 
that I do tend to supplement those
smoothies<00:00:08.130> with<00:00:08.340> protein<00:00:08.880> powders<00:00:10.250> I've<00:00:11.250> been

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
smoothies with protein powders I've been

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.839 
smoothies with protein powders I've been
taking<00:00:11.969> protein<00:00:12.469> supplements<00:00:13.469> now<00:00:13.730> for<00:00:14.730> about

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
taking protein supplements now for about

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.120 
taking protein supplements now for about
the<00:00:15.120> last<00:00:15.150> decade<00:00:15.920> decade<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.100> half

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
the last decade decade and a half

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.609 
the last decade decade and a half
somewhere<00:00:17.850> in<00:00:17.910> that<00:00:17.970> range<00:00:18.240> anyway<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:19.020> at

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
somewhere in that range anyway and at

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.730 
somewhere in that range anyway and at
this<00:00:19.830> point<00:00:20.189> in<00:00:20.640> my<00:00:21.119> life<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.900> have<00:00:22.260> basically

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
this point in my life I have basically

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.670 
this point in my life I have basically
broken<00:00:23.100> down<00:00:23.660> protein<00:00:24.660> supplements<00:00:25.260> into<00:00:25.500> two

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
broken down protein supplements into two

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.390 
broken down protein supplements into two
categories<00:00:26.449> that<00:00:27.449> I<00:00:27.480> use<00:00:27.840> in<00:00:27.990> order<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.400> meet

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
categories that I use in order to meet

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.179 
categories that I use in order to meet
my<00:00:29.609> health<00:00:30.150> goals<00:00:30.390> that<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.689> have<00:00:30.900> on<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.009> right

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
my health goals that I have on the right

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.630 
my health goals that I have on the right
you'll<00:00:32.399> see<00:00:32.460> that<00:00:33.120> there<00:00:33.390> are<00:00:33.710> three<00:00:34.710> kinds<00:00:35.370> of

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
you'll see that there are three kinds of

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.220 
you'll see that there are three kinds of
protein<00:00:36.090> or<00:00:36.300> three<00:00:36.510> different<00:00:36.780> brands<00:00:37.020> of

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
protein or three different brands of

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.549 
protein or three different brands of
protein<00:00:37.590> really<00:00:38.270> and<00:00:39.270> two<00:00:39.690> different<00:00:39.989> kinds

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
protein really and two different kinds

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.940 
protein really and two different kinds
there<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.700> let's<00:00:42.540> see<00:00:42.750> on<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.870> right<00:00:43.079> here<00:00:43.260> to

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
there is let's see on the right here to

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.240 
there is let's see on the right here to
weigh<00:00:44.520> based<00:00:44.989> proteins<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.590> these<00:00:47.100> are

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
weigh based proteins and these are

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.479 
weigh based proteins and these are
powder<00:00:47.489> form<00:00:48.110> whey<00:00:49.110> is<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.469> milk<00:00:49.800> by-product

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
powder form whey is a milk by-product

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.170 
powder form whey is a milk by-product
and<00:00:50.700> then<00:00:51.570> here<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.649> called<00:00:53.489> raw<00:00:53.820> protein

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
and then here this is called raw protein

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.939 
and then here this is called raw protein
from<00:00:54.510> garden<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.930> life<00:00:55.079> really<00:00:55.559> like<00:00:55.710> this

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
from garden of life really like this

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.660 
from garden of life really like this
stuff<00:00:56.190> it's<00:00:57.059> derived<00:00:57.989> actually<00:00:58.770> from<00:00:59.039> a

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
stuff it's derived actually from a

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.400 
stuff it's derived actually from a
variety<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.390> different<00:01:00.719> kinds<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:00.989> plant

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
variety of different kinds of plant

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
variety of different kinds of plant
sprouts<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.430> it's<00:01:03.329> organic<00:01:04.080> it's<00:01:04.559> vegan<00:01:05.100> it's

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
sprouts and it's organic it's vegan it's

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.649 
sprouts and it's organic it's vegan it's
lactose<00:01:05.939> free<00:01:06.740> and<00:01:07.740> it's<00:01:08.400> really<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.760> very<00:01:09.240> good

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
lactose free and it's really a very good

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.719 
lactose free and it's really a very good
product<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.890> fact<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.189> would<00:01:11.310> say<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:11.549> is

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
product in fact I would say this is

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.480 
product in fact I would say this is
probably<00:01:12.360> really<00:01:12.720> close<00:01:13.350> or<00:01:13.830> as<00:01:13.979> close<00:01:14.310> to

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
probably really close or as close to

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.929 
probably really close or as close to
eating<00:01:15.240> raw<00:01:15.659> food<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:17.159> isn't<00:01:17.400> actually<00:01:17.580> raw

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
eating raw food that isn't actually raw

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.310 
eating raw food that isn't actually raw
food<00:01:18.270> as<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:19.049> can<00:01:19.200> get<00:01:20.630> this<00:01:21.630> product<00:01:21.990> here

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
food as you can get this product here

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.530 
food as you can get this product here
again<00:01:22.560> milk<00:01:23.220> based<00:01:23.549> what<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:23.939> like<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.330> look<00:01:24.479> for

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
again milk based what I like to look for

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.660 
again milk based what I like to look for
at<00:01:24.990> this<00:01:25.170> point<00:01:25.520> is<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:27.470> product<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.670> is

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
at this point is a product that is

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.700 
at this point is a product that is
derived<00:01:30.210> from<00:01:30.450> cows<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.380> have<00:01:31.530> not<00:01:31.680> been

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
derived from cows that have not been

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.050 
derived from cows that have not been
treated<00:01:32.220> with<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:33.740> bovine<00:01:34.740> growth<00:01:35.130> hormone

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
treated with the bovine growth hormone

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.890 
treated with the bovine growth hormone
and<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.200> rb/gh<00:01:38.270> that<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.390> see<00:01:39.600> here

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
and that is the rb/gh that you see here

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.630 
and that is the rb/gh that you see here
our<00:01:40.470> BGH<00:01:41.220> free<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:42.000> always<00:01:42.390> look<00:01:42.630> for<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:42.869> I

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
our BGH free I always look for that I

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.760 
our BGH free I always look for that I
don't<00:01:44.640> need<00:01:44.759> any<00:01:44.939> of<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.479> then<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.619> can

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
don't need any of that and then you can

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.719 
don't need any of that and then you can
see<00:01:46.979> here<00:01:47.189> J<00:01:47.460> Rob<00:01:47.700> he<00:01:48.060> also<00:01:48.390> makes<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.720> protein

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
see here J Rob he also makes a protein

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.139 
see here J Rob he also makes a protein
he's<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:50.880> pretty<00:01:51.149> well<00:01:51.360> known<00:01:51.390> that<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:53.149> rb/gh

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
he's is pretty well known that is rb/gh

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.850 
he's is pretty well known that is rb/gh
free<00:01:54.840> as<00:01:54.990> well<00:01:56.090> so<00:01:57.090> those<00:01:57.270> are<00:01:57.450> your<00:01:57.600> your<00:01:58.079> whey

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
free as well so those are your your whey

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.719 
free as well so those are your your whey
proteins<00:01:59.579> I<00:01:59.880> also<00:02:00.060> like<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.600> use<00:02:00.630> vanilla<00:02:01.729> and

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
proteins I also like to use vanilla and

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.010 
proteins I also like to use vanilla and
the<00:02:02.909> reason<00:02:03.299> is<00:02:03.420> because<00:02:03.540> there<00:02:03.840> are<00:02:03.869> other

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
the reason is because there are other

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.249 
the reason is because there are other
flavors<00:02:04.680> they<00:02:04.890> make<00:02:05.070> chocolate<00:02:05.579> they<00:02:05.820> make

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
flavors they make chocolate they make

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.570 
flavors they make chocolate they make
you<00:02:07.259> know<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.409> variety<00:02:07.619> of<00:02:07.799> other<00:02:07.950> flavors

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
you know a variety of other flavors

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.940 
you know a variety of other flavors
strawberry<00:02:09.509> however<00:02:10.170> what<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:10.349> find<00:02:10.709> is<00:02:10.920> that

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
strawberry however what I find is that

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:11.600 
strawberry however what I find is that
the<00:02:11.190> vanilla

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
the vanilla

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.080 
the vanilla
seems<00:02:12.240> to<00:02:12.770> from<00:02:13.770> a<00:02:13.800> taste<00:02:14.100> perspective<00:02:14.820> work

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
seems to from a taste perspective work

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.210 
seems to from a taste perspective work
really<00:02:15.780> well<00:02:16.080> with<00:02:16.380> a<00:02:16.440> variety<00:02:16.650> of<00:02:17.070> different

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
really well with a variety of different

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.100 
really well with a variety of different
types<00:02:17.550> of<00:02:17.790> fruits<00:02:18.000> worse<00:02:18.240> if<00:02:18.720> you<00:02:18.990> get

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
types of fruits worse if you get

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.340 
types of fruits worse if you get
chocolate<00:02:19.320> or<00:02:19.650> strawberry<00:02:19.790> flavored<00:02:21.350> product

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
chocolate or strawberry flavored product

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.530 
chocolate or strawberry flavored product
then<00:02:22.710> you<00:02:22.740> find<00:02:23.310> that<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.490> kind<00:02:24.030> of<00:02:24.060> you<00:02:24.360> tend

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
then you find that you kind of you tend

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.030 
then you find that you kind of you tend
to<00:02:24.630> limit<00:02:24.990> I<00:02:25.080> think<00:02:25.320> from<00:02:25.740> a<00:02:25.830> taste

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
to limit I think from a taste

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.940 
to limit I think from a taste
perspective<00:02:26.840> what<00:02:27.840> sorts<00:02:28.200> of<00:02:28.350> fruits<00:02:28.800> that

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
perspective what sorts of fruits that

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.820 
perspective what sorts of fruits that
you<00:02:29.160> can<00:02:29.400> actually<00:02:29.610> use<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.480> make<00:02:31.440> a<00:02:31.470> tasty

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
you can actually use to make a tasty

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.150 
you can actually use to make a tasty
meal<00:02:32.790> replacement<00:02:33.600> smoothie<00:02:34.020> and<00:02:34.710> speaking

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
meal replacement smoothie and speaking

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.220 
meal replacement smoothie and speaking
of<00:02:35.250> that<00:02:35.340> that's<00:02:35.550> really<00:02:35.850> what<00:02:36.180> I<00:02:36.240> use<00:02:36.720> these

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
of that that's really what I use these

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.710 
of that that's really what I use these
proteins<00:02:38.010> for<00:02:38.550> would<00:02:38.940> be<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.090> meal<00:02:39.510> replacement

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
proteins for would be a meal replacement

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.860 
proteins for would be a meal replacement
that's<00:02:40.530> specifically<00:02:41.310> why<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:41.730> would<00:02:42.390> use

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
that's specifically why I would use

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.710 
that's specifically why I would use
these<00:02:43.140> types<00:02:43.620> of<00:02:43.860> protein<00:02:44.340> if<00:02:44.970> I'm<00:02:45.240> just<00:02:45.630> gonna

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
these types of protein if I'm just gonna

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.550 
these types of protein if I'm just gonna
make<00:02:45.990> a<00:02:46.020> smoothie<00:02:46.800> that<00:02:47.130> is<00:02:47.840> replacing<00:02:48.840> either

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
make a smoothie that is replacing either

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.120 
make a smoothie that is replacing either
a<00:02:49.680> snack<00:02:50.130> or<00:02:50.550> a<00:02:51.090> full<00:02:52.050> meal<00:02:52.290> lunch<00:02:52.770> or

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
a snack or a full meal lunch or

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.880 
a snack or a full meal lunch or
breakfast<00:02:53.880> then<00:02:54.360> I<00:02:54.750> would<00:02:54.930> I<00:02:55.140> would<00:02:55.320> use

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
breakfast then I would I would use

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.670 
breakfast then I would I would use
either<00:02:56.820> one<00:02:57.209> of<00:02:57.270> these<00:02:57.360> or<00:02:57.480> a<00:02:57.780> combination<00:02:58.200> of

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
either one of these or a combination of

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.900 
either one of these or a combination of
these<00:02:59.510> to<00:03:00.680> maintain<00:03:01.680> a<00:03:01.709> high<00:03:02.070> protein<00:03:02.370> level

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
these to maintain a high protein level

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.180 
these to maintain a high protein level
in<00:03:03.120> that<00:03:03.330> in<00:03:03.540> that<00:03:03.660> meal<00:03:05.990> these<00:03:06.990> over<00:03:07.440> here<00:03:07.470> are

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
in that in that meal these over here are

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.120 
in that in that meal these over here are
completely<00:03:08.790> different<00:03:09.360> in<00:03:09.810> that<00:03:10.110> I<00:03:10.380> use<00:03:10.800> them

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
completely different in that I use them

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.080 
completely different in that I use them
for<00:03:11.990> exclusively<00:03:12.990> for<00:03:14.090> post-workout

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
for exclusively for post-workout

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.050 
for exclusively for post-workout
recovery<00:03:15.150> so<00:03:16.080> if<00:03:16.350> you're<00:03:16.440> gonna<00:03:16.530> have<00:03:16.800> a<00:03:17.370> heavy

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
recovery so if you're gonna have a heavy

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.940 
recovery so if you're gonna have a heavy
workouts<00:03:18.540> or<00:03:18.959> even<00:03:19.230> a<00:03:19.290> moderately<00:03:19.709> heavy

workouts or even a moderately heavy

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.820 
workouts or even a moderately heavy
workout<00:03:20.900> you're<00:03:21.900> gonna<00:03:21.989> get<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.260> micro<00:03:22.590> tears

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
workout you're gonna get the micro tears

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.759 
workout you're gonna get the micro tears
in<00:03:23.370> your<00:03:23.580> muscle<00:03:23.910> tissue<00:03:24.200> we've<00:03:25.200> all<00:03:25.350> felt<00:03:25.560> the

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
in your muscle tissue we've all felt the

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.470 
in your muscle tissue we've all felt the
soreness<00:03:26.190> before<00:03:26.580> especially<00:03:27.090> as<00:03:27.180> we<00:03:27.269> get<00:03:27.360> to

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
soreness before especially as we get to

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.740 
soreness before especially as we get to
my<00:03:27.600> age<00:03:27.630> 44<00:03:28.410> you<00:03:29.340> feeling<00:03:29.640> even<00:03:29.790> longer<00:03:30.150> or<00:03:30.540> you

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
my age 44 you feeling even longer or you

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.320 
my age 44 you feeling even longer or you
feel<00:03:31.170> them<00:03:31.380> more<00:03:31.860> and<00:03:32.160> you<00:03:32.489> feel<00:03:32.670> them<00:03:32.820> longer

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
feel them more and you feel them longer

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.850 
feel them more and you feel them longer
and<00:03:33.900> so<00:03:34.200> a<00:03:34.890> designer<00:03:36.019> sports<00:03:37.019> whey<00:03:37.320> protein

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
and so a designer sports whey protein

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.110 
and so a designer sports whey protein
like<00:03:38.070> this<00:03:38.660> will<00:03:39.660> at<00:03:40.620> least<00:03:40.980> it's<00:03:41.340> advertised

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
like this will at least it's advertised

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.610 
like this will at least it's advertised
to<00:03:42.690> help<00:03:43.260> you<00:03:43.620> recover<00:03:44.130> more<00:03:44.489> quickly<00:03:45.380> and<00:03:46.380> so

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
to help you recover more quickly and so

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.320 
to help you recover more quickly and so
I've<00:03:46.739> tried<00:03:47.040> a<00:03:47.190> variety<00:03:47.970> over<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.180> last

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
I've tried a variety over the last

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.210 
I've tried a variety over the last
decade<00:03:48.780> of<00:03:48.900> tried<00:03:49.170> a<00:03:49.200> variety<00:03:49.380> of<00:03:49.830> these

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
decade of tried a variety of these

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.660 
decade of tried a variety of these
different<00:03:50.600> designer<00:03:51.600> whey<00:03:51.840> proteins<00:03:52.410> and<00:03:52.830> I

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
different designer whey proteins and I

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.070 
different designer whey proteins and I
felt<00:03:54.060> anywhere<00:03:54.390> from<00:03:54.780> really<00:03:55.440> no<00:03:56.220> benefit<00:03:56.760> to

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
felt anywhere from really no benefit to

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.170 
felt anywhere from really no benefit to
moderate<00:03:58.080> benefit<00:03:58.590> and<00:03:58.860> then<00:03:59.459> not<00:03:59.730> long<00:03:59.940> ago

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
moderate benefit and then not long ago

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.380 
moderate benefit and then not long ago
the<00:04:00.510> CrossFit<00:04:01.050> community<00:04:01.080> that<00:04:01.709> I<00:04:02.269> that<00:04:03.269> I

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
the CrossFit community that I that I

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.600 
the CrossFit community that I that I
partake<00:04:03.930> in<00:04:03.989> I<00:04:04.500> really<00:04:04.920> started<00:04:05.160> promoting

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
partake in I really started promoting

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.320 
partake in I really started promoting
this<00:04:05.730> progenesis<00:04:06.540> formula<00:04:07.250> and<00:04:08.330> the

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
this progenesis formula and the

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.110 
this progenesis formula and the
progenitor<00:04:09.750> for<00:04:09.989> Mila<00:04:10.470> actually<00:04:11.340> works<00:04:11.549> the

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
progenitor for Mila actually works the

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.500 
progenitor for Mila actually works the
very<00:04:12.630> first<00:04:13.019> time<00:04:13.230> I<00:04:13.260> tried<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:13.830> recovery

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
very first time I tried the recovery

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.570 
very first time I tried the recovery
which<00:04:15.510> is<00:04:15.720> this<00:04:15.900> bag<00:04:16.169> here<00:04:16.680> I<00:04:16.890> get<00:04:17.220> the<00:04:17.400> raw

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
which is this bag here I get the raw

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.740 
which is this bag here I get the raw
formula<00:04:18.299> which<00:04:18.419> no<00:04:19.380> flavor

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
formula which no flavor

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.300 
formula which no flavor
and<00:04:20.989> no<00:04:21.350> fructose<00:04:21.920> or<00:04:22.220> or<00:04:22.610> other<00:04:23.150> sugars<00:04:23.840> are

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
and no fructose or or other sugars are

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.570 
and no fructose or or other sugars are
actually<00:04:25.310> in<00:04:25.550> this<00:04:26.030> particular<00:04:26.210> product<00:04:27.580> the

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
actually in this particular product the

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.580 
actually in this particular product the
very<00:04:28.760> first<00:04:29.000> time<00:04:29.150> I<00:04:29.180> tried<00:04:29.360> this<00:04:29.600> I<00:04:30.050> noticed<00:04:30.350> a

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
very first time I tried this I noticed a

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.120 
very first time I tried this I noticed a
huge<00:04:31.010> difference<00:04:31.760> in<00:04:31.940> my<00:04:31.970> recovery<00:04:32.360> time<00:04:33.130> and

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
huge difference in my recovery time and

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.880 
huge difference in my recovery time and
I've<00:04:34.910> been<00:04:35.090> using<00:04:35.270> it<00:04:35.480> pretty<00:04:35.890> consistently

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
I've been using it pretty consistently

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.380 
I've been using it pretty consistently
for<00:04:37.670> about<00:04:37.850> the<00:04:38.030> last<00:04:38.500> nine<00:04:39.500> months<00:04:39.530> and<00:04:40.390> it's

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
for about the last nine months and it's

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 
confirmed addicts more muscle I really

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.580 
confirmed addicts more muscle I really
haven't<00:05:31.100> used<00:05:31.400> very<00:05:31.669> often<00:05:32.050> or<00:05:33.050> for<00:05:33.200> very<00:05:33.380> long

haven't used very often or for very long

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.590

so I really can't vouch for its
effectiveness<00:05:36.190> yet<00:05:37.510> but<00:05:38.510> it<00:05:38.690> actually<00:05:38.930> takes

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
effectiveness yet but it actually takes

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.830 
effectiveness yet but it actually takes
me<00:05:39.740> even<00:05:40.070> further<00:05:40.400> away<00:05:40.669> from<00:05:41.180> this<00:05:41.390> standard

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
me even further away from this standard

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:47.010 
me even further away from this standard
I<00:05:41.990> have<00:05:42.200> because<00:05:42.979> not<00:05:43.160> only<00:05:43.190> is<00:05:43.490> it<00:05:43.669> our<00:05:45.190> bgh

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
I have because not only is it our bgh

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.310 
I have because not only is it our bgh
not<00:05:48.020> only<00:05:48.229> is<00:05:48.350> it<00:05:48.500> not<00:05:49.030> rb/gh<00:05:50.030> free<00:05:50.810> but<00:05:51.110> it

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.320 
not only is it not rb/gh free but it

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.740 
not only is it not rb/gh free but it
also<00:05:51.500> contains<00:05:52.310> fructose<00:05:53.060> as<00:05:53.860> its<00:05:54.860> sweetener

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
also contains fructose as its sweetener

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:00.390 
also contains fructose as its sweetener
which<00:05:57.010> is<00:05:58.010> a<00:05:58.070> big<00:05:58.280> no-no<00:05:58.460> for<00:05:58.910> me

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 
which is a big no-no for me

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.280 
which is a big no-no for me
unfortunately<00:06:01.400> it's<00:06:01.580> not<00:06:01.760> a

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:02.290 
unfortunately it's not a

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:04.060 
unfortunately it's not a
stevia-sweetened<00:06:03.290> product<00:06:03.710> which<00:06:03.830> would<00:06:03.919> be

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.070 
stevia-sweetened product which would be

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.610 
stevia-sweetened product which would be
nice<00:06:04.280> but<00:06:04.870> we'll<00:06:05.870> have<00:06:05.960> to<00:06:06.080> wait<00:06:06.229> a<00:06:06.260> few<00:06:06.470> months

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620 
nice but we'll have to wait a few months

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.820 
nice but we'll have to wait a few months
