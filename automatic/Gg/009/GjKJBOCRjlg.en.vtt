00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:10.470
 you 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.470
 after the dress especially 

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:16.139
 after receiving a diamond disk 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.420
 for being the most selling group of the year 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.430
 the blue angels remembered that before 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.619
 of the success of his last album several 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.050
 labels closed the doors on the 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.900
 face in touching the doors in other 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.630
 companies I think it is 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.450
 you as a musician who already had a 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.100
 career and records won and public that 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.809
 I recognized you many sold discs 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.710
 and when it 's the door it's the door that you 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:43.510
 closes the truth it feels ugly but I 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.640
 I think that at the time each manager 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.790
 who is in charge of that company 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.950
 hugs motives 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.430
 maybe it 's look is the group already 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.490
 went out of style to the best in the group 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.220
 it is not worth investing and so on 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.980
 etcetera but I believe that in closing a 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.229
 door does not mean 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.840
 the angels race is over 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:11.050
 we keep working 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:14.440
 and I believe that the way God puts it 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:17.430
 you know I just met 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.430
 it's a girl 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.710
 Jorge MejÃ­a author of the successes of 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.740
 The group revealed how issues such as the 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.100
 ribbon of your hair delivery of love how 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.600
 I 'm going to forget you 17 years among others 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.810
 it's like a ray of light that comes from 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.420
 up indirectly to my thinking 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:44.220
 today to my soul and that is when it came out in the 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:47.640
 song if this is a romanticism be 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.220
 very very nice that is gives the flavor to 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.840
 the cumbia so that people are at 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.020
 the same guy who is dancing is 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.590
 enamore 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.590
 this word
