is you rest them on there and then you

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.250 
is you rest them on there and then you
just<00:03:04.720> rub<00:03:05.110> and<00:03:05.650> it<00:03:06.220> kind<00:03:06.400> of<00:03:06.459> just<00:03:06.610> mutes<00:03:06.880> it<00:03:07.260> it

just rub and it kind of just mutes it it

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.690

gives<00:03:08.470> it<00:03:08.590> that<00:03:08.620> sound<00:03:09.010> instead<00:03:09.310> of<00:03:11.640> okay<00:03:12.640> so

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
gives it that sound instead of okay so

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.640 
gives it that sound instead of okay so
as<00:03:13.120> if<00:03:13.330> most<00:03:13.540> rock<00:03:13.750> bands<00:03:13.959> kind<00:03:14.260> of<00:03:14.320> use<00:03:14.470> it

by<00:05:01.200> the<00:05:01.260> way<00:05:01.410> video<00:05:01.740> for<00:05:02.010> this<00:05:02.450> totally<00:05:03.450> random

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
by the way video for this totally random

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.840 
by the way video for this totally random
but<00:05:04.050> anyways<00:05:04.890> I<00:05:05.070> mean<00:05:05.310> it's<00:05:05.430> probably<00:05:05.700> like

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
but anyways I mean it's probably like

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.000 
but anyways I mean it's probably like
some<00:05:06.090> 21st<00:05:06.480> century<00:05:06.630> amazing<00:05:07.410> creative<00:05:07.740> idea

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
some 21st century amazing creative idea

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.580 
some 21st century amazing creative idea
and<00:05:08.190> I'm<00:05:09.180> just<00:05:09.450> obviously<00:05:09.570> not<00:05:09.900> on<00:05:10.020> a<00:05:10.110> level<00:05:10.260> to

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
and I'm just obviously not on a level to

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.290 
and I'm just obviously not on a level to
understand<00:05:11.400> it<00:05:11.580> it's<00:05:11.850> a<00:05:11.910> little<00:05:12.000> bit<00:05:12.120> random

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
understand it it's a little bit random

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.350 
understand it it's a little bit random
anyway<00:05:12.870> so<00:05:13.440> um<00:05:13.680> so<00:05:14.580> that's<00:05:14.730> the<00:05:15.060> strumming

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
anyway so um so that's the strumming

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.950 
anyway so um so that's the strumming
pattern<00:05:15.390> is<00:05:15.870> down<00:05:16.710> down<00:05:17.190> up<00:05:17.520> up<00:05:17.820> down<00:05:18.450> up<00:05:18.510> down

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
pattern is down down up up down up down

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:27.820 
pattern is down down up up down up down
down<00:05:19.560> up<00:05:20.010> up<00:05:20.310> down<00:05:20.910> down<00:05:25.130> and<00:05:26.130> you<00:05:27.000> do<00:05:27.270> down

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
down up up down down and you do down

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:35.270 
down up up down down and you do down
down<00:05:32.690> you<00:05:33.690> do<00:05:33.870> that<00:05:34.080> strumming<00:05:34.410> pattern<00:05:34.770> once

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
down you do that strumming pattern once

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.950 
down you do that strumming pattern once
on<00:05:35.640> each<00:05:35.790> chord<00:05:36.090> sound<00:05:37.730> down<00:05:38.730> down<00:05:39.330> down<00:05:39.930> up

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
on each chord sound down down down up

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:45.549 
on each chord sound down down down up
down<00:05:40.440> up<00:05:41.010> down

00:05:45.549 --> 00:05:45.559 

00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:48.469 

okay<00:05:46.559> so<00:05:46.860> yes<00:05:47.490> one<00:05:47.759> does<00:05:47.879> that<00:05:47.999> seem<00:05:48.119> tiresome

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 
okay so yes one does that seem tiresome

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:52.219 
okay so yes one does that seem tiresome
that's<00:05:49.759> everything<00:05:50.759> I<00:05:50.849> think<00:05:51.059> oh<00:05:51.300> yeah<00:05:51.779> please

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
requests but I do kind of take a while

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.689 
requests but I do kind of take a while
getting<00:05:57.659> around<00:05:57.959> to<00:05:58.080> them<00:05:58.199> it's<00:05:58.860> all<00:05:58.949> good<00:05:59.099> my

00:05:59.689 --> 00:05:59.699 
getting around to them it's all good my

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:02.899 
getting around to them it's all good my
lesson<00:06:00.059> for<00:06:00.209> the<00:06:00.270> day<00:06:00.740> if<00:06:01.740> I<00:06:01.949> got<00:06:02.129> around<00:06:02.459> me<00:06:02.639> um

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:02.909 
lesson for the day if I got around me um

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:11.320 
lesson for the day if I got around me um
Oh<00:06:05.149> was<00:06:06.149> this<00:06:07.399> chemistry<00:06:09.020> scintillating

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.330 
Oh was this chemistry scintillating

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:17.179 
Oh was this chemistry scintillating
alright<00:06:12.330> okay<00:06:12.569> okay<00:06:14.240> so<00:06:15.469> phenyl<00:06:16.469> is<00:06:16.680> a<00:06:16.860> lot

00:06:17.179 --> 00:06:17.189 
alright okay okay so phenyl is a lot

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:20.869 
alright okay okay so phenyl is a lot
more<00:06:17.430> reactive<00:06:17.909> than<00:06:18.149> bromine<00:06:19.399> no<00:06:20.399> fee<00:06:20.729> no<00:06:20.759> is

00:06:20.869 --> 00:06:20.879 
more reactive than bromine no fee no is

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:22.510 
more reactive than bromine no fee no is
a<00:06:20.969> lot<00:06:21.119> more<00:06:21.240> reactive<00:06:21.599> than<00:06:21.629> benzene<00:06:21.779> because

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:22.520 
a lot more reactive than benzene because

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.619 
a lot more reactive than benzene because
benteen's<00:06:23.520> got<00:06:23.729> like<00:06:23.879> loads<00:06:24.270> of<00:06:24.449> kind

00:06:24.619 --> 00:06:24.629 
benteen's got like loads of kind

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:26.420 
benteen's got like loads of kind
electrons<00:06:25.110> all<00:06:25.319> spread<00:06:25.559> out<00:06:25.589> and<00:06:25.919> that<00:06:26.219> gives

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:26.430 
electrons all spread out and that gives

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.519 
electrons all spread out and that gives
it<00:06:26.490> a<00:06:26.580> really<00:06:26.610> low<00:06:26.969> electron<00:06:27.360> density<00:06:27.719> so<00:06:28.349> that

00:06:28.519 --> 00:06:28.529 
it a really low electron density so that

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:30.109 
it a really low electron density so that
means<00:06:28.709> it's<00:06:28.860> not<00:06:28.889> very<00:06:29.159> reactive<00:06:29.430> so<00:06:29.819> it<00:06:29.909> can't

00:06:30.109 --> 00:06:30.119 
means it's not very reactive so it can't

00:06:30.119 --> 00:06:31.670 
means it's not very reactive so it can't
like<00:06:30.330> you<00:06:30.569> know<00:06:30.689> kind<00:06:31.020> of<00:06:31.050> polarize<00:06:31.469> other

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 
like you know kind of polarize other

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.959 
like you know kind of polarize other
molecules<00:06:32.159> and<00:06:32.339> then<00:06:32.459> get<00:06:32.610> them<00:06:32.759> to<00:06:32.789> like

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:32.969 
molecules and then get them to like

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:33.829 
molecules and then get them to like
react<00:06:33.209> with<00:06:33.360> each<00:06:33.449> other

00:06:33.829 --> 00:06:33.839 
react with each other

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:35.570 
react with each other
phenyl<00:06:34.619> on<00:06:34.769> the<00:06:34.860> other<00:06:34.979> hand<00:06:35.159> because<00:06:35.430> it's

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 
phenyl on the other hand because it's

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:36.920 
phenyl on the other hand because it's
got<00:06:35.699> those<00:06:35.849> two<00:06:36.119> lone<00:06:36.300> pairs<00:06:36.539> on<00:06:36.809> the<00:06:36.899> oxygen

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:36.930 
got those two lone pairs on the oxygen

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.769 
got those two lone pairs on the oxygen
at<00:06:37.409> the<00:06:37.469> top<00:06:37.649> the<00:06:38.309> lone<00:06:38.789> pairs<00:06:38.999> get<00:06:39.209> drawn<00:06:39.599> into

00:06:39.769 --> 00:06:39.779 
at the top the lone pairs get drawn into

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:41.929 
at the top the lone pairs get drawn into
the<00:06:39.930> benzene<00:06:40.229> ring<00:06:40.289> and<00:06:40.649> then<00:06:41.279> you<00:06:41.490> know<00:06:41.639> so

00:06:41.929 --> 00:06:41.939 
the benzene ring and then you know so

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:44.359 
the benzene ring and then you know so
that<00:06:42.089> increases<00:06:42.659> the<00:06:43.379> electron<00:06:43.769> density<00:06:43.889> so

00:06:44.359 --> 00:06:44.369 
that increases the electron density so

00:06:44.369 --> 00:06:46.369 
that increases the electron density so
that<00:06:44.490> means<00:06:44.969> phenol<00:06:45.389> has<00:06:45.539> a<00:06:45.569> higher<00:06:45.869> electron

00:06:46.369 --> 00:06:46.379 
that means phenol has a higher electron

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:48.829 
that means phenol has a higher electron
density<00:06:46.800> than<00:06:47.219> benzene<00:06:47.539> then<00:06:48.539> that<00:06:48.659> means

00:06:48.829 --> 00:06:48.839 
density than benzene then that means

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:51.379 
density than benzene then that means
it's<00:06:49.050> more<00:06:49.169> reactive<00:06:49.619> and<00:06:49.849> yeah<00:06:50.849> it's<00:06:51.300> all

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:51.389 
it's more reactive and yeah it's all

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:55.219 
it's more reactive and yeah it's all
good<00:06:51.509> it<00:06:51.749> can<00:06:51.990> be<00:06:52.339> electrons<00:06:53.339> cause<00:06:54.229> this

00:06:55.219 --> 00:06:55.229 
good it can be electrons cause this

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:56.659 
good it can be electrons cause this
basically<00:06:55.680> it<00:06:55.860> means<00:06:56.009> phenol<00:06:56.430> is<00:06:56.519> more

00:06:56.659 --> 00:06:56.669 
basically it means phenol is more

00:06:56.669 --> 00:06:58.459 
basically it means phenol is more
reactive<00:06:57.089> than<00:06:57.240> benzene<00:06:57.389> and<00:06:58.079> it's<00:06:58.229> so<00:06:58.289> good

00:06:58.459 --> 00:06:58.469 
reactive than benzene and it's so good

00:06:58.469 --> 00:07:00.469 
reactive than benzene and it's so good
in<00:06:58.860> your<00:06:58.949> life<00:06:59.159> I<00:06:59.579> assure<00:06:59.939> you<00:06:59.969> your<00:07:00.300> life

00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:00.479 
in your life I assure you your life

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:02.779 
in your life I assure you your life
won't<00:07:00.719> be<00:07:00.809> good<00:07:01.019> if<00:07:01.229> you<00:07:01.289> don't<00:07:01.619> know<00:07:01.889> that<00:07:02.159> but

00:07:02.779 --> 00:07:02.789 
won't be good if you don't know that but

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:06.889 
won't be good if you don't know that but
because<00:07:03.059> I'm<00:07:03.269> fun<00:07:03.539> I<00:07:03.719> do<00:07:04.069> see<00:07:05.069> ya<00:07:05.719> have<00:07:06.719> a<00:07:06.749> nice
