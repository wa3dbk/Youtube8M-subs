00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.320
 this is a video to clarify a 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.039
 situation that already 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.150
 and good and I'm tired a little bit of 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.930
 answer it so I'm to preferred 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.680
 make a video and answer it already 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.779
 openly because they have asked me 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.650
 both on twitter and on YouTube you eat it 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.170
 on facebook and good is basically for 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.239
 answer this big question in which 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.730
 many ask me what is where 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.800
 I got the beta or suddenly you'll stay 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.989
 walks of the best laugh because you 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.320
 you are playing bird supercharged mini yo 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.640
 no and not like that and I stay like that 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.649
 fart 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.600
 I have not played the beta in any 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.239
 moment of gears of war 2000 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.750
 I think it's that confusion 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.829
 created to certain videos that I have uploaded 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.449
 but I've made it clear both in the 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.539
 description as I have commented on it in 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.280
 the videos and also those comments 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:11.100
 but then you see that the comments are 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.320
 happen or are people who do not read or do not finish 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.440
 to watch the videos or I do not know many of the 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.780
 videos that I uploaded mostly at the beginning 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.660
 or in some cases are videos of gameplays 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.760
 that bring to light not just me the 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.060
 analyzed the comments something like this 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.220
 and there are other gameplays that I found 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.460
 good to ask permission to put them 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.050
 on my channel and everything and they are gameplays of 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.230
 conventions not that I do not know where to side 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.840
 have been made in san francisco in I do not know 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.710
 the truth I really do not remember in the 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.560
 pax experian madrid 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.360
 but it's from some people who went there 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.130
 and they played it was the only way to 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.990
 play course several less attending 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.760
 these conventions and good to play it 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.920
 try it and they recorded it with 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.170
 your cell phone 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.290
 What I did was ask permission 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.520
 they gave good permission I do not even know 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.030
 it's because many traces of well 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.399
 received 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.790
 that video so I really do not know who 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:09.350
 he was the exact owner of this video but 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.870
 I ask him on the web and he told me 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.940
 He said no and well I uploaded 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.629
 I turned down the volume because there was a lot 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:20.180
 noise and good I started commenting that it 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:22.069
 I saw that we can appreciate the examples and 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.540
 all that but I have never 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.489
 played no time I have answered 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.890
 thousands of times both on twitter facebook 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.440
 I clarify it on YouTube but I said he 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.599
 he keeps asking and well if he wanted 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.849
 make this video because the truth is not no 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.110
 there's beta and I do not think there's the same 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.459
 they want to ask yes I think there 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.800
 a beta not the truth anymore I do not think that 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.390
 there is going to be a public beta 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.580
 the only time you can play was 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.260
 private and it was by means of conventions 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.710
 and things like that where they would show the 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.430
 game and it came to play 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:54.170
 and once played free formed but not already 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.140
 I do not think there's beta but what's missing 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.210
 it comes out in March the game does not I do not see I do not think 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.740
 that you also want to risk here 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.330
 we can try this game because many 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.490
 We still have our doubt as to whether it is going to 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.620
 be a good game no and I the truth if 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.420
 I'm going to buy it but then I do not 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.400
 put on the same comment if it's a 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.830
 good game or not really we just have 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.960
 seen what he wanted to be we have seen 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.120
 to see a soccer freak and we know something of 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.410
 domination and good these days 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.740
 surely it will be coming out more 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:25.340
 information since 2013 a little bit of new 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.900
 information more images videos do not know yo 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.460
 I will be presenting you to the channel like this 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.470
 that in case they are not subscribed subscribe 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.690
 I repeat it is not played the beta 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.490
 clarifying I have not played I've never seen 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.990
 factors that I would like 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:40.250
 you but not really not and good if 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.360
 be as I comment you can 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.190
 subscribe to the channel we will be 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.930
 believing everything everything everything that comes out of 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.760
 course by georg men to be aware 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.560
 can not also continue in the 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.790
 social networks like facebook and twitter 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.800
 which is important because that's where 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.680
 clear all this all this kind of thing 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.079
 not that you suddenly have a doubt 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.159
 I want you to answer faster than in 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:59.870
 youtube because on youtube sometimes you 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:01.640
 they lose the comments because there is a 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.670
 good choice private messages in my 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:07.040
 facebook page or if you want to leave it 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.859
 there public also on twitter is very 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.810
 important that and then good gentlemen and 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:14.569
 it is clear this is in hopefully I can 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.400
 leave your like and for more people to see 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:18.109
 this video is not especially the ones that 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.729
 they asked me then so that they 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.109
 it's a little bit lighter and I do not know what 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.910
 I will be putting the background I imagine that 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:26.389
 in some images are videos of 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.039
 recording that I did not play myself so good 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:29.449
 levels nothing this was a video where more 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:31.930
 to clarify that and see you until the 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:31.930
 next chau
