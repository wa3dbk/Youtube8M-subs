this is my EE 495 final project which is
a<00:00:08.090> vehicle<00:00:09.090> datalogger

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:10.070

tool<00:00:17.300> basically<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.659> way<00:00:18.779> it<00:00:18.900> works<00:00:19.109> is<00:00:20.210> we

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
tool basically the way it works is we

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:28.479 
tool basically the way it works is we
have<00:00:21.239> an<00:00:21.509> old<00:00:21.800> obd2<00:00:24.019> rs-232<00:00:25.019> cable<00:00:25.669> and<00:00:26.810> then

00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:28.489 
have an old obd2 rs-232 cable and then

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:33.500 
have an old obd2 rs-232 cable and then
there's<00:00:29.489> an<00:00:29.929> elm327<00:00:30.929> chip<00:00:32.210> which<00:00:33.210> is<00:00:33.239> a

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
there's an elm327 chip which is a

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.889 
there's an elm327 chip which is a
pre-programmed<00:00:34.079> peg<00:00:34.620> from<00:00:34.949> electronics<00:00:35.899> this

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
pre-programmed peg from electronics this

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.080 
pre-programmed peg from electronics this
chip<00:00:37.289> lets<00:00:37.559> me<00:00:37.769> talk<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:39.199> ECU<00:00:40.199> and

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
chip lets me talk to the ECU and

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.880 
chip lets me talk to the ECU and
supports<00:00:42.090> different<00:00:42.660> protocols<00:00:43.289> such<00:00:43.590> as<00:00:43.620> the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
supports different protocols such as the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.810 
supports different protocols such as the
canned<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:45.230> so<00:00:47.300> here<00:00:48.300> we<00:00:48.480> have<00:00:48.629> 80<00:00:49.199> mega<00:00:49.820> 3:28

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
canned I so here we have 80 mega 3:28

00:00:50.820 --> 00:01:00.979 
canned I so here we have 80 mega 3:28

logger<00:01:01.289> shield<00:01:01.679> for<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:01.949> Arduino<00:01:03.980> and<00:01:05.930> this

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
logger shield for the Arduino and this

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.950 
logger shield for the Arduino and this
AVR<00:01:07.680> is<00:01:07.710> uh<00:01:08.570> has<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.750> arduino<00:01:10.110> bootloader

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
AVR is uh has the arduino bootloader

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.590 
AVR is uh has the arduino bootloader
there<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.190> MCP<00:01:14.190> two<00:01:14.490> five<00:01:14.760> five<00:01:15.030> one<00:01:15.270> chip

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
there is MCP two five five one chip

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.740 
there is MCP two five five one chip
which<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.230> a<00:01:16.500> can<00:01:16.740> transceiver<00:01:17.420> which<00:01:18.420> lets

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
which is a can transceiver which lets

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.740 
which is a can transceiver which lets
the<00:01:18.930> elm<00:01:19.200> chip<00:01:19.820> use<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.030> can<00:01:21.300> and<00:01:22.040> a<00:01:23.750> 3-axis

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
the elm chip use the can and a 3-axis

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:35.080 
the elm chip use the can and a 3-axis
accelerometer

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.310 

so<00:01:36.090> now<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.450> gives<00:01:36.690> us<00:01:36.780> an<00:01:36.900> error<00:01:37.110> message

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
so now it gives us an error message

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:47.580 
so now it gives us an error message
because<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.920> don't<00:01:38.100> have<00:01:38.220> an<00:01:38.400> SD<00:01:38.670> card

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.609 

it<00:01:48.250> reads<00:01:48.460> it<00:01:48.579> correctly<00:01:49.060> right<00:01:49.359> now<00:01:50.259> it<00:01:50.469> says

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
it reads it correctly right now it says

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.770 
it reads it correctly right now it says
zero<00:01:50.979> miles<00:01:51.280> per<00:01:51.520> hour<00:01:51.609> and<00:01:51.789> zero<00:01:52.119> rpm<00:01:52.390> because

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
zero miles per hour and zero rpm because

00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:00.420 
zero miles per hour and zero rpm because
the<00:01:53.020> engine

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.400 

as<00:02:01.430> you<00:02:01.520> can<00:02:01.640> see<00:02:01.790> properly<00:02:02.300> reached<00:02:02.600> the<00:02:02.810> RPM

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
as you can see properly reached the RPM

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:12.570 
as you can see properly reached the RPM
and<00:02:04.660> the<00:02:05.660> speed<00:02:05.930> it's<00:02:06.470> zero<00:02:06.950> for<00:02:07.340> some<00:02:07.490> part

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580
