dating handoffs so what happens when we

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.029 
dating handoffs so what happens when we
are<00:00:12.580> going<00:00:12.759> through<00:00:12.969> petals<00:00:13.809> we<00:00:14.080> have<00:00:14.589> been

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:15.039 
are going through petals we have been

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:18.210 
are going through petals we have been
through<00:00:15.490> a<00:00:15.730> toss<00:00:16.240> that<00:00:16.510> it's<00:00:16.690> not<00:00:17.560> normal<00:00:18.010> many

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.220 
through a toss that it's not normal many

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.040 
through a toss that it's not normal many
more<00:00:18.550> hair<00:00:18.940> than<00:00:19.300> normal

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.050 
more hair than normal

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.500 
more hair than normal
every<00:00:20.920> normal<00:00:21.400> hair<00:00:21.670> that<00:00:21.850> you<00:00:21.970> see<00:00:22.180> falling

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:22.510 
every normal hair that you see falling

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.770 
every normal hair that you see falling
tends<00:00:23.230> to<00:00:23.440> trigger<00:00:23.680> panic<00:00:24.580> or<00:00:25.450> an<00:00:25.630> anxiety

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:25.780 
tends to trigger panic or an anxiety

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.410 
tends to trigger panic or an anxiety
type<00:00:26.470> reaction<00:00:26.980> that<00:00:27.490> you<00:00:27.610> think<00:00:27.940> your<00:00:28.180> hair

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.420 
type reaction that you think your hair

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.060 
type reaction that you think your hair
is<00:00:28.630> falling<00:00:28.930> out<00:00:29.170> and<00:00:29.380> I<00:00:29.440> see<00:00:29.680> this<00:00:29.890> all<00:00:30.040> the

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
is falling out and I see this all the

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.310 
is falling out and I see this all the
time<00:00:30.220> and<00:00:31.000> when<00:00:31.120> I<00:00:31.150> was<00:00:31.390> losing<00:00:31.720> my<00:00:31.750> hair<00:00:32.110> even

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
time and when I was losing my hair even

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.799 
time and when I was losing my hair even
though<00:00:32.619> I<00:00:32.649> understood<00:00:33.219> the<00:00:33.340> science<00:00:33.640> it<00:00:34.600> was

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
though I understood the science it was

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:37.709 
though I understood the science it was
still<00:00:35.050> hard<00:00:35.350> to<00:00:35.739> overcome<00:00:36.670> every<00:00:37.239> strand<00:00:37.600> of

00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:37.719 
still hard to overcome every strand of

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:40.680 
still hard to overcome every strand of
hair<00:00:37.899> coming<00:00:38.410> out<00:00:38.649> so<00:00:38.920> what<00:00:39.609> we<00:00:39.789> do<00:00:40.030> is<00:00:40.300> we<00:00:40.510> can

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
hair coming out so what we do is we can

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.459 
hair coming out so what we do is we can
teach<00:00:40.929> you<00:00:41.140> how<00:00:41.170> to<00:00:41.409> do<00:00:41.649> a<00:00:41.949> head<00:00:42.579> count<00:00:42.609> so<00:00:43.469> we

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:44.469 
teach you how to do a head count so we

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:47.729 
teach you how to do a head count so we
all<00:00:44.710> lose<00:00:44.949> between<00:00:45.489> 70<00:00:46.059> and<00:00:46.210> 160<00:00:47.109> has<00:00:47.319> per<00:00:47.559> day

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
all lose between 70 and 160 has per day

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:49.950 
all lose between 70 and 160 has per day
so<00:00:48.370> of<00:00:48.489> course<00:00:48.760> if<00:00:48.909> you<00:00:49.030> naturally<00:00:49.480> have<00:00:49.510> finer

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
so of course if you naturally have finer

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.750 
so of course if you naturally have finer
hair<00:00:50.140> you're<00:00:50.890> going<00:00:50.980> to<00:00:51.039> be<00:00:51.190> on<00:00:51.309> the<00:00:51.429> lower<00:00:51.579> end

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
hair you're going to be on the lower end

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.959 
hair you're going to be on the lower end
70<00:00:52.600> to<00:00:52.749> 100<00:00:53.199> if<00:00:53.319> you<00:00:53.350> have<00:00:53.679> thicker<00:00:54.069> hair<00:00:54.100> over

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:54.969 
70 to 100 if you have thicker hair over

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:56.639 
70 to 100 if you have thicker hair over
the<00:00:55.059> entire<00:00:55.479> head<00:00:55.659> that<00:00:55.870> is<00:00:55.960> gonna<00:00:56.140> be<00:00:56.350> able<00:00:56.409> to

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
the entire head that is gonna be able to

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.029 
the entire head that is gonna be able to
see<00:00:56.739> 100<00:00:56.920> to<00:00:57.280> 160<00:00:58.269> what's<00:00:59.199> important<00:00:59.769> to<00:00:59.859> know

00:01:00.029 --> 00:01:00.039 
see 100 to 160 what's important to know

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:02.520 
see 100 to 160 what's important to know
here<00:01:00.370> is<00:01:00.429> also<00:01:00.819> the<00:01:01.030> length<00:01:01.269> of<00:01:01.600> hair<00:01:01.929> so

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
here is also the length of hair so

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.219 
here is also the length of hair so
obviously<00:01:02.949> a<00:01:03.010> shorter<00:01:03.760> hair<00:01:04.120> strand<00:01:04.510> is<00:01:04.870> going

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
obviously a shorter hair strand is going

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:08.039 
obviously a shorter hair strand is going
to<00:01:05.470> appear<00:01:06.370> at<00:01:06.520> a<00:01:06.670> lesser<00:01:07.060> volume<00:01:07.600> of<00:01:07.810> hair

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
to appear at a lesser volume of hair

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:11.789 
to appear at a lesser volume of hair
than<00:01:08.710> a<00:01:08.979> longer<00:01:09.490> hair<00:01:09.700> strand<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:11.170> we<00:01:11.439> have<00:01:11.619> you

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 
than a longer hair strand so we have you

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:14.760 
than a longer hair strand so we have you
the<00:01:12.009> medium<00:01:12.520> hair<00:01:13.149> strand<00:01:13.570> today<00:01:13.960> and<00:01:14.320> we've

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
the medium hair strand today and we've

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.080 
the medium hair strand today and we've
collected<00:01:16.710> 116<00:01:17.710> years<00:01:17.950> to<00:01:18.159> show<00:01:18.430> you<00:01:18.490> how<00:01:18.880> it

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
collected 116 years to show you how it

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.590 
collected 116 years to show you how it
looks

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
looks

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.469 
looks
get<00:01:20.469> down<00:01:20.740> here<00:01:21.070> and<00:01:22.380> we've<00:01:23.380> counted<00:01:24.090> half<00:01:25.090> of

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
get down here and we've counted half of

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.459 
get down here and we've counted half of
them<00:01:25.780> so<00:01:26.170> exactly<00:01:26.740> 80<00:01:27.039> so<00:01:28.030> here<00:01:28.270> we<00:01:28.450> have<00:01:28.689> 18

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:29.469 
them so exactly 80 so here we have 18

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:30.970 
them so exactly 80 so here we have 18
strands<00:01:30.250> of<00:01:30.340> hair

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:30.980 
strands of hair

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.840 
strands of hair
here<00:01:31.310> we<00:01:31.430> have<00:01:31.870> 160<00:01:32.870> strands<00:01:33.530> of<00:01:33.740> hair<00:01:33.950> you

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
here we have 160 strands of hair you

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.510 
here we have 160 strands of hair you
wouldn't<00:01:35.180> want<00:01:35.420> to<00:01:35.510> be<00:01:35.750> counting<00:01:36.200> 160<00:01:37.130> strands

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
wouldn't want to be counting 160 strands

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.670 
wouldn't want to be counting 160 strands
of<00:01:37.640> hair<00:01:37.820> all<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.090> time<00:01:38.300> so<00:01:38.990> that's<00:01:39.170> why<00:01:39.260> we

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
of hair all the time so that's why we

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.830 
of hair all the time so that's why we
say<00:01:39.920> if<00:01:40.190> you<00:01:40.370> can<00:01:40.580> count<00:01:40.850> 18<00:01:41.300> then<00:01:41.570> you<00:01:41.660> can

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
say if you can count 18 then you can

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.160 
say if you can count 18 then you can
compare<00:01:42.440> how<00:01:43.400> the<00:01:43.460> piles<00:01:43.970> looks<00:01:44.510> even<00:01:44.840> Cleary

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
compare how the piles looks even Cleary

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.290 
compare how the piles looks even Cleary
see<00:01:45.560> there's<00:01:46.220> a<00:01:46.400> difference<00:01:46.850> there<00:01:47.090> between

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
see there's a difference there between

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.930 
see there's a difference there between
the<00:01:47.870> amount<00:01:48.440> of<00:01:48.590> hair<00:01:48.830> for<00:01:49.460> this<00:01:49.550> particular

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
the amount of hair for this particular

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.450 
the amount of hair for this particular
hair<00:01:50.450> strand<00:01:50.920> see<00:01:51.920> if<00:01:51.980> you're<00:01:52.100> holding<00:01:52.370> it

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
hair strand see if you're holding it

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.670 
hair strand see if you're holding it
between<00:01:52.580> my<00:01:52.910> fingers<00:01:53.290> it's<00:01:54.290> probably<00:01:54.590> about

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
between my fingers it's probably about

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.770 
between my fingers it's probably about
20<00:01:55.220> centimeters<00:01:55.790> long<00:01:56.000> so<00:01:56.270> that's<00:01:56.450> just<00:01:56.570> an

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
20 centimeters long so that's just an

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.590 
20 centimeters long so that's just an
average<00:01:57.350> hair<00:01:57.770> net<00:01:58.010> so<00:01:58.340> obviously<00:01:58.850> if<00:01:59.300> the

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
average hair net so obviously if the

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.190 
average hair net so obviously if the
hair<00:01:59.840> was<00:02:00.400> longer<00:02:01.630> then<00:02:02.630> it's<00:02:02.840> going<00:02:03.020> to

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
hair was longer then it's going to

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.130 
hair was longer then it's going to
increase<00:02:03.410> the<00:02:03.830> size<00:02:04.190> of<00:02:04.550> the<00:02:04.700> pile<00:02:04.970> so<00:02:05.840> we<00:02:05.990> have

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
increase the size of the pile so we have

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.950 
increase the size of the pile so we have
to<00:02:06.290> consider<00:02:06.470> again<00:02:06.890> we<00:02:07.520> all<00:02:07.670> lose<00:02:07.940> between<00:02:08.420> 70

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
to consider again we all lose between 70

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.340 
to consider again we all lose between 70
to<00:02:09.070> 160<00:02:10.070> has<00:02:10.310> every<00:02:10.790> single<00:02:11.150> day<00:02:11.330> so<00:02:12.050> if<00:02:12.200> you're

the hair that comes out of the scalp it
has<00:03:17.750> a<00:03:17.780> bulb<00:03:18.110> you<00:03:18.440> can<00:03:18.470> have<00:03:18.739> this<00:03:18.830> little

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
has a bulb you can have this little

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.100 
has a bulb you can have this little
white<00:03:19.340> dot<00:03:19.670> on<00:03:19.850> the<00:03:20.120> end<00:03:20.239> and<00:03:20.540> at<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:20.930> other

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
white dot on the end and at the other

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.440 
white dot on the end and at the other
end<00:03:21.440> so<00:03:22.160> you<00:03:22.250> need<00:03:22.430> to<00:03:22.580> see<00:03:22.820> that<00:03:23.090> the<00:03:23.180> hairs

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
end so you need to see that the hairs

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.540 
end so you need to see that the hairs
have<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:23.989> bulb<00:03:24.230> or<00:03:24.530> don't<00:03:24.920> have<00:03:25.160> the<00:03:25.220> bulb

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:26.530 
have the bulb or don't have the bulb
because<00:03:25.880> there's<00:03:26.060> a<00:03:26.120> different

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
because there's a different

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.170 
because there's a different
between<00:03:26.840> hair<00:03:27.170> loss<00:03:27.379> and<00:03:27.709> hair<00:03:28.189> breakage<00:03:28.670> and

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
between hair loss and hair breakage and

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.819 
between hair loss and hair breakage and
the<00:03:29.299> other<00:03:29.510> thing<00:03:29.750> is<00:03:29.870> when<00:03:30.110> the<00:03:30.290> hairs<00:03:30.530> aren't

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
the other thing is when the hairs aren't

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:33.250 
the other thing is when the hairs aren't
growing<00:03:31.069> properly<00:03:31.400> it<00:03:32.239> doesn't<00:03:32.569> necessarily

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
growing properly it doesn't necessarily

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.259 
growing properly it doesn't necessarily
mean<00:03:33.469> that<00:03:33.530> every<00:03:34.010> hair<00:03:34.219> that<00:03:34.430> falls<00:03:34.670> out<00:03:35.000> is

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
mean that every hair that falls out is

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.140 
mean that every hair that falls out is
going<00:03:35.510> to<00:03:35.659> be<00:03:35.810> 20<00:03:36.500> centimeters<00:03:37.069> long<00:03:37.250> it<00:03:37.909> may

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
going to be 20 centimeters long it may

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.179 
going to be 20 centimeters long it may
be<00:03:38.209> 5<00:03:38.629> centimeters<00:03:39.290> long<00:03:39.530> 10<00:03:39.890> centimeters

00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:40.189 
be 5 centimeters long 10 centimeters

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:41.979 
be 5 centimeters long 10 centimeters
long<00:03:40.640> because<00:03:41.030> there<00:03:41.180> might<00:03:41.359> be<00:03:41.390> something

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
long because there might be something

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.710 
long because there might be something
wrong<00:03:42.170> with<00:03:42.530> their<00:03:42.890> cycle<00:03:43.370> so<00:03:43.970> I<00:03:44.000> need<00:03:44.299> to<00:03:44.480> know

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
wrong with their cycle so I need to know

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.710 
wrong with their cycle so I need to know
how<00:03:45.290> many<00:03:45.349> are<00:03:46.129> over<00:03:46.819> what<00:03:47.090> length<00:03:47.390> and<00:03:47.599> how

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
how many are over what length and how

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.020 
how many are over what length and how
many<00:03:47.959> do<00:03:48.170> have<00:03:48.409> hair<00:03:48.650> bulbs<00:03:49.129> so<00:03:49.609> if<00:03:49.670> you<00:03:49.819> do

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
many do have hair bulbs so if you do

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.080 
many do have hair bulbs so if you do
that<00:03:50.269> when<00:03:50.930> you're<00:03:51.109> concerned<00:03:51.609> once<00:03:52.609> weird
