life so all together I think I'm on 15%
and<00:02:17.530> it's<00:02:18.100> pretty<00:02:18.340> good<00:02:18.489> I<00:02:18.760> suppose

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
and it's pretty good I suppose

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.410 
and it's pretty good I suppose
yeah<00:02:21.519> so<00:02:21.670> I<00:02:21.700> thought<00:02:21.910> through<00:02:22.090> that<00:02:22.300> because

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
yeah so I thought through that because

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.970 
yeah so I thought through that because
it's<00:02:22.750> something<00:02:23.050> a<00:02:23.080> little<00:02:23.560> small<00:02:23.830> and

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
it's something a little small and

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.050 
it's something a little small and
interesting<00:02:24.430> that<00:02:24.550> people<00:02:24.880> might<00:02:25.030> have

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
interesting that people might have

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.660 
interesting that people might have
missed<00:02:25.390> or<00:02:25.540> not<00:02:25.720> know<00:02:25.870> how<00:02:25.959> to<00:02:26.019> do<00:02:26.319> it<00:02:26.470> and<00:02:26.670> even

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
missed or not know how to do it and even

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.400 
missed or not know how to do it and even
