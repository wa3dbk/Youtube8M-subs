gum paste make the back part the octave

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.530 
gum paste make the back part the octave
one<00:03:02.050> one<00:03:02.410> of<00:03:02.560> each<00:03:02.710> and<00:03:03.640> I'm<00:03:04.180> going<00:03:04.330> to<00:03:04.360> show

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
you how I'm going to apply it I am

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.250 
you how I'm going to apply it I am
thinking<00:03:07.090> that<00:03:07.120> I'm<00:03:07.300> gonna<00:03:07.480> make<00:03:07.690> this<00:03:07.840> just<00:03:08.080> a

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
thinking that I'm gonna make this just a

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.750 
thinking that I'm gonna make this just a
little<00:03:08.710> bit<00:03:09.040> longer<00:03:09.660> I'm<00:03:10.660> looking<00:03:11.110> at<00:03:11.260> this

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
little bit longer I'm looking at this

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.910 
little bit longer I'm looking at this
over<00:03:12.760> here<00:03:15.210> and<00:03:16.210> I'm<00:03:17.050> not<00:03:17.230> sure<00:03:17.500> if<00:03:17.650> I'm<00:03:17.770> gonna

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
over here and I'm not sure if I'm gonna

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.560 
over here and I'm not sure if I'm gonna
get<00:03:18.070> the<00:03:18.220> same<00:03:18.430> effect<00:03:18.850> that<00:03:18.940> I<00:03:19.060> want<00:03:19.240> anyway

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
get the same effect that I want anyway

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.360 
get the same effect that I want anyway
that<00:03:20.080> might<00:03:20.230> make<00:03:20.440> it<00:03:20.470> a<00:03:20.620> little<00:03:20.800> longer<00:03:21.040> the

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
that might make it a little longer the

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.820 
that might make it a little longer the
thing<00:03:21.610> that<00:03:21.760> I<00:03:21.850> have<00:03:22.090> to<00:03:22.270> do<00:03:22.450> before<00:03:22.660> I<00:03:22.930> finish

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
thing that I have to do before I finish

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.590 
thing that I have to do before I finish
it<00:03:23.980> up<00:03:24.100> or<00:03:24.280> before<00:03:24.610> it<00:03:24.700> hardens<00:03:25.180> I<00:03:25.300> have<00:03:25.450> to

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
it up or before it hardens I have to

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.990 
it up or before it hardens I have to
make<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:25.960> holes<00:03:26.200> for<00:03:26.470> the<00:03:26.530> laces<00:03:27.070> and<00:03:27.280> put<00:03:27.880> the

make the holes for the laces and put the
laces<00:03:28.420> in<00:03:28.570> because<00:03:28.990> you<00:03:29.980> know<00:03:30.100> you're<00:03:30.490> always

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
laces in because you know you're always

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.020 
laces in because you know you're always

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
difficult the last time I made the

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.280 
difficult the last time I made the
booties<00:03:36.040> to<00:03:36.790> put<00:03:36.970> the<00:03:37.090> inflated<00:03:37.840> things

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290

booties to put the inflated things
okay<00:03:38.680> I'll<00:03:38.890> return<00:03:39.630> this<00:03:40.630> is<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:40.960> back

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
okay I'll return this is the back

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.290 
okay I'll return this is the back
portion<00:03:41.560> that<00:03:41.920> I<00:03:41.950> just<00:03:42.250> cut<00:03:42.490> out<00:03:42.610> I<00:03:42.790> made<00:03:43.120> it

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
portion that I just cut out I made it

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.460 
portion that I just cut out I made it
just<00:03:43.330> a<00:03:43.600> tad<00:03:43.930> larger<00:03:45.180> then<00:03:46.180> that<00:03:46.510> on<00:03:46.810> the<00:03:46.960> ends

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
just a tad larger then that on the ends

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.320

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
that I've made the texture on it now I'm

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.140 
that I've made the texture on it now I'm
gonna<00:04:08.080> make<00:04:08.260> the<00:04:08.320> holes<00:04:08.680> it's<00:04:09.310> not<00:04:09.580> even<00:04:10.030> as

gonna make the holes it's not even as
you<00:04:10.270> can<00:04:10.330> see<00:04:10.600> but<00:04:10.750> I'm<00:04:10.840> not<00:04:10.990> real<00:04:11.140> worried

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470

you can see but I'm not real worried
about<00:04:11.650> it<00:04:11.830> because<00:04:11.920> what's<00:04:12.370> on<00:04:12.490> each<00:04:12.730> side<00:04:13.060> I'm

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
about it because what's on each side I'm

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:20.180 
about it because what's on each side I'm
going<00:04:13.990> to<00:04:14.230> make<00:04:14.380> the<00:04:14.500> holes<00:04:14.800> for<00:04:15.100> the<00:04:15.160> laces

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.500 

and<00:04:21.190> I<00:04:21.370> don't<00:04:21.549> want<00:04:21.700> to<00:04:21.760> put<00:04:21.940> them<00:04:22.090> too<00:04:22.480> close

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
and I don't want to put them too close

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.350 
and I don't want to put them too close
to<00:04:23.260> the<00:04:23.380> edge<00:04:23.560> because<00:04:23.800> it'll<00:04:24.250> break<00:04:24.460> so<00:04:25.300> I'm

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
to the edge because it'll break so I'm

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.480 
to the edge because it'll break so I'm
just<00:04:25.510> gonna<00:04:25.690> put<00:04:25.930> two<00:04:26.260> little<00:04:26.590> holes<00:04:26.950> for<00:04:27.190> the

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
just gonna put two little holes for the

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.970 
just gonna put two little holes for the
laces<00:04:28.000> and<00:04:28.240> I'm<00:04:28.900> going<00:04:29.080> to<00:04:29.140> put<00:04:29.350> Kelly<00:04:29.590> green

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
laces and I'm going to put Kelly green

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.400 
laces and I'm going to put Kelly green
ribbon<00:04:30.640> in<00:04:30.760> there<00:04:30.970> I'm<00:04:31.780> gonna<00:04:31.900> see<00:04:32.170> if<00:04:32.260> it's

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
ribbon in there I'm gonna see if it's

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.510 
ribbon in there I'm gonna see if it's
through<00:04:32.800> the<00:04:33.010> other<00:04:33.160> side<00:04:35.100> because<00:04:36.100> once

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
through the other side because once

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.330 
through the other side because once
these<00:04:36.730> dry<00:04:37.180> it's<00:04:37.990> very<00:04:38.470> difficult<00:04:39.040> and<00:04:39.220> I'm

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
these dry it's very difficult and I'm

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.950 
these dry it's very difficult and I'm
all<00:04:39.460> probably<00:04:39.910> going<00:04:40.120> to<00:04:40.210> put<00:04:40.360> the<00:04:40.480> ribbon<00:04:40.810> in

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
all probably going to put the ribbon in

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.770 
all probably going to put the ribbon in
even<00:04:41.590> before<00:04:41.770> it<00:04:42.100> dries<00:04:42.340> so<00:04:43.300> now<00:04:43.390> let<00:04:43.540> me<00:04:43.630> go

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
even before it dries so now let me go

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.230 
even before it dries so now let me go
back<00:04:43.990> and<00:04:44.260> show<00:04:44.320> you<00:04:44.530> what<00:04:44.740> I'm<00:04:44.860> doing<00:04:45.180> this<00:04:46.180> is

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
back and show you what I'm doing this is

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.750 
back and show you what I'm doing this is
going<00:04:46.720> to<00:04:46.810> be<00:04:46.960> the<00:04:47.110> back<00:04:47.350> portion<00:04:47.800> of<00:04:48.130> the

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
going to be the back portion of the

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.550 
going to be the back portion of the
bootie<00:04:49.200> you<00:04:50.200> get<00:04:50.410> that

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
bootie you get that

them<00:05:37.720> because<00:05:37.840> you<00:05:38.229> never<00:05:38.349> know<00:05:39.000> once<00:05:40.000> you<00:05:40.270> get

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:40.509

the<00:05:41.819> once<00:05:42.819> you<00:05:43.030> get<00:05:43.270> the<00:05:43.680> this<00:05:44.680> hardens<00:05:45.280> you'll

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:45.639 
the once you get the this hardens you'll

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:47.760 
the once you get the this hardens you'll
never<00:05:45.880> be<00:05:46.060> able<00:05:46.210> to<00:05:46.300> get<00:05:46.449> those<00:05:46.569> laces<00:05:46.870> on<00:05:47.229> I'm

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:50.139 
not sure if I even like that might even

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:52.379 
not sure if I even like that might even
have<00:05:50.380> to<00:05:50.410> be<00:05:50.650> a<00:05:50.680> little<00:05:50.979> larger<00:05:51.160> I<00:05:51.759> might<00:05:52.210> do

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:52.389 
have to be a little larger I might do

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:54.180 
have to be a little larger I might do
another<00:05:52.419> one<00:05:52.900> of<00:05:53.020> these<00:05:53.169> because<00:05:53.620> I<00:05:53.740> see<00:05:54.039> that

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.190 
another one of these because I see that

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.939 
another one of these because I see that
my<00:05:54.370> tongue<00:05:54.699> is<00:05:54.910> really<00:05:55.120> sitting<00:05:56.050> up<00:05:56.319> very<00:05:56.650> high

my tongue is really sitting up very high

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:00.240 
my tongue is really sitting up very high
so<00:05:57.990> I'll<00:05:58.990> get<00:05:59.259> back<00:05:59.470> to<00:05:59.500> it<00:05:59.710> I'm<00:05:59.919> going<00:06:00.039> to<00:06:00.099> try

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
so I'll get back to it I'm going to try

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:01.710 
so I'll get back to it I'm going to try
to<00:06:00.340> put<00:06:00.550> the<00:06:00.639> laces<00:06:01.030> in<00:06:01.210> and<00:06:01.360> then<00:06:01.479> I'll<00:06:01.599> get

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720 
to put the laces in and then I'll get

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:08.580 
to put the laces in and then I'll get
back<00:06:04.050> okay<00:06:05.050> so<00:06:05.110> I<00:06:05.800> made<00:06:06.699> a<00:06:06.729> little<00:06:06.940> piece<00:06:07.590> it's

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.590 
back okay so I made a little piece it's

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.670 
back okay so I made a little piece it's
like<00:06:08.740> I<00:06:08.889> said<00:06:08.949> out<00:06:09.370> of<00:06:09.400> my<00:06:09.699> cutter<00:06:10.680> nothing

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
like I said out of my cutter nothing

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:21.089 
like I said out of my cutter nothing
fancy<00:06:12.360> and<00:06:15.300> out<00:06:16.300> of<00:06:16.509> it<00:06:19.199> if<00:06:20.199> I<00:06:20.380> want<00:06:20.650> time<00:06:20.919> you

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:21.099 
fancy and out of it if I want time you

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:23.129 
fancy and out of it if I want time you
might<00:06:21.340> put<00:06:21.789> some<00:06:22.030> around<00:06:22.330> the<00:06:22.449> back<00:06:22.659> but<00:06:22.960> right

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:23.139 
might put some around the back but right

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:26.610 
might put some around the back but right
now<00:06:24.030> that's<00:06:25.030> about<00:06:25.270> it<00:06:25.630> I<00:06:25.810> just<00:06:26.259> wanted<00:06:26.500> to

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:26.620 
now that's about it I just wanted to

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.790 
now that's about it I just wanted to
show<00:06:26.860> you<00:06:26.889> the<00:06:27.190> technique<00:06:27.669> I<00:06:28.199> think<00:06:29.199> this<00:06:29.620> is

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:29.800 
show you the technique I think this is

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.820 
show you the technique I think this is
one<00:06:29.949> of<00:06:30.099> the<00:06:30.389> most<00:06:31.389> requested<00:06:31.659> I<00:06:32.409> don't<00:06:32.680> have

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:34.389 
that many to get it out but this is

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:38.430 
that many to get it out but this is
probably<00:06:34.599> one<00:06:35.110> of<00:06:35.139> the<00:06:35.320> most<00:06:35.530> requested<00:06:37.440> and
