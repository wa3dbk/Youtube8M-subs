 choice and using a roll 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.490
 these two layers and it's well dry 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.320
 positioned the 3d stencil according to the location you want 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.390
 decorated you can help you repositionable school how much ribbon 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.360

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.610
 to ensure a good support 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.750
 it is the choice 3 December the team in summer it applies on any surface to 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:00.910
 decorate 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.160
 a tip to familiarize yourself with the technique do tests on a 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.160
 sheet and before decorating your support 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.520
 apply 3d paint directly on the sidewalk 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.280
 at the end of the tunnel 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.170
 spread the paint with a spatula 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.240
 it would take the whole massif by ironing several times with the spatula 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.240
 crossing crossing power 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.250
 that is to say the stencil delicately 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.930
 in a vertical way 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.020
 immediately after the application clean the stencil with water 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.680
 the application will be easier because this painting is very thick and it 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.660
 adheres perfectly well on clean supports and smooth like wood 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.260

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.079
 patience will be dry touched in six hours the optimal resistance will be 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:05.539
 obtained in three days and can be last after seven days 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.119
 before applying the stencil again 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.409
 let it dry well it will facilitate the handling 

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:17.199
 you can speed up the drying of her hair 

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:21.439
 and the Swiss you can partially obscure the stencil if you do not 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:24.439
 want to realize that part of the match 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:31.230
 accentuate their allies but what I know is very discouraging we 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.579
 we added a piece of media news corp 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:36.579
