00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:08.029
 you 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.340
 very good girls very good guys and 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.230
 grandchildren and we are in a new news of 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.710
 sony playstation 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.880
 and that is all attention because they are and 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.919
 they have a lot of habit just like 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.660
 Many companies register 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:21.140
 patents that can be used in a 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.240
 future 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.970
 and is that attention with this patent of 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.830
 sound that was recorded in 2012 but that 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.160
 has come to light during these last 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:33.739
 days only records a patent that 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.660
 expand old bodies with more 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:40.219
 contained yes as you are hearing it and 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.739
 I can use the new service 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:47.539
 Gaikai in the future could use the 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:49.850
 cloud and without touching the title code or 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:52.340
 apply patches let's explain it the 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.699
 technology in the cloud you already know allows 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:58.850
 inventions that we would have never thought of 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:02.270
 the first playstation era and that is 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.399
 likely to end up good we apply in 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.920
 this fourth generation of consoles 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:08.970
 desktop sony in addition to the patent 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.420
 that has come to light 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.310
 It will be patent registered in 2012 but 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.710
 it has not been until now when it has 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.370
 could discover that with the cloud is 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.140
 possible to modify games previously 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:25.230
 launched to add new content 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.620
 on the fly and without touching any single line 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.180
 of the game code itself the use of 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.250
 this registered technology is the 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.740
 next I will explain so that what 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.200
 You can understand step by step the 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.690
 developers can generate a 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.200
 capture of the player's situation and in 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.240
 that precise moment pause the game and 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.750
 give way to for example a content that 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.910
 he was not present in the original game 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.610
 using the cloud the player can access 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.710
 for example to an additional content without 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.680
 have to download anything or apply a 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.690
 update patch although the 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.150
 patent is logically focused on 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.430
 these are the games business 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.210
 may expand to other areas such as the 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.720
 public the advertising 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.970
 according to the patent in the place of 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.730
 play the game again in the same 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.700
 level players want new challenges 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.130
 in the games of the past for it the 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.470
 designers have minion eggs that 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.080
 can offer new goals or challenges 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.170
 to your friends differently than 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.820
 original design the modifications are not 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.210
 they would apply directly on the game 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:38.660
 so your code remains intact itself 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:41.180
 but they become effective on a 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.950
 apparent additional layer that is put on 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.140
 to the game what makes it once 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.300
 finished the content is returned to the 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.180
 initial game of the original game of 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.060
 that we are playing but they are 4 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.580
 let's remember a 9 compatible center is not 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.860
 retrocompatible by hardware but 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.870
 it will end secure by software at the end 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:04.400
 of this year or the beginning of the next 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:06.980
 in europe as you already know with gaikai like this 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.360
 how good you know this technology is 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.670
 can apply a future I think the 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.700
 we will end up seeing sure and here 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.640
 we are as always to inform you 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:21.640
 and you know we are in the following 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.640
 and favorites we'll see you next
