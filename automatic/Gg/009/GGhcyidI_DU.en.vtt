00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.180 
99 2 799 which to me is a great deal
because<00:02:37.930> I<00:02:38.080> heard<00:02:38.260> like<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:38.560> Mac<00:02:38.740> pumps<00:02:39.070> are

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
because I heard like the Mac pumps are

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.780 
because I heard like the Mac pumps are
ten<00:02:39.400> dollars<00:02:39.850> or<00:02:40.150> more<00:02:40.810> so<00:02:41.320> I'm<00:02:42.250> even<00:02:42.670> with<00:02:42.760> the

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
ten dollars or more so I'm even with the

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.970 
ten dollars or more so I'm even with the
NARS<00:02:43.060> foundation<00:02:43.630> some<00:02:43.840> of<00:02:43.960> them<00:02:44.080> you<00:02:44.500> have<00:02:44.770> to

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
NARS foundation some of them you have to

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.710 
NARS foundation some of them you have to
buy<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.190> pump<00:02:45.760> and<00:02:45.910> I<00:02:46.060> think<00:02:46.270> the<00:02:46.360> pump<00:02:46.570> is

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720

buy the pump and I think the pump is
like<00:02:46.870> twelve<00:02:47.200> dollars<00:02:47.500> or<00:02:47.650> something<00:02:47.950> so<00:02:48.160> this

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
like twelve dollars or something so this

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.090 
like twelve dollars or something so this
is<00:02:49.090> a<00:02:49.120> great<00:02:49.330> deal<00:02:49.600> for<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:49.930> pumps<00:02:50.230> being<00:02:50.470> 699

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
is a great deal for the pumps being 699

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.160 
is a great deal for the pumps being 699
and<00:02:51.520> they<00:02:51.610> do<00:02:51.670> have<00:02:52.090> them<00:02:52.240> for<00:02:52.450> high-end<00:02:52.900> and

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
and they do have them for high-end and

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.590

low-end<00:02:53.470> farm<00:02:54.160> drugstore<00:02:54.940> foundation<00:02:55.420> so

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
find a pump for this foundation which

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.970 
find a pump for this foundation which
can<00:03:46.030> be<00:03:46.150> really<00:03:46.570> really<00:03:46.720> frustrating<00:03:47.530> so

therefore it now has a pump now I really

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.530 
therefore it now has a pump now I really
wish<00:03:51.220> that<00:03:51.370> the<00:03:51.520> pump<00:03:51.760> came<00:03:52.030> all<00:03:52.270> the<00:03:52.390> way<00:03:52.450> down

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
wish that the pump came all the way down

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.180 
wish that the pump came all the way down
on<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:52.930> bottle<00:03:53.380> and<00:03:53.500> looked<00:03:53.680> all<00:03:53.830> cute<00:03:54.100> and

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
on the bottle and looked all cute and

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.490 
on the bottle and looked all cute and
nice<00:03:54.520> it<00:03:54.970> doesn't<00:03:55.450> really<00:03:55.540> look<00:03:55.870> like<00:03:55.930> that<00:03:56.320> it

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
nice it doesn't really look like that it

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.650 
nice it doesn't really look like that it
just<00:03:56.530> kind<00:03:56.920> of<00:03:57.010> looks<00:03:57.070> like<00:03:57.310> a<00:03:57.580> misfit<00:03:58.120> pump<00:03:58.420> to

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660

just kind of looks like a misfit pump to
me<00:03:58.810> but<00:03:59.440> the<00:03:59.620> fact<00:03:59.860> that<00:03:59.950> it<00:04:00.220> fits<00:04:00.820> on<00:04:01.030> here
