00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
doing a little review on that I know the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.819 
doing a little review on that I know the
bodies<00:00:37.829> still<00:00:38.070> clear<00:00:39.230> mostly<00:00:40.230> because<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.530> ran

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
bodies still clear mostly because I ran

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.310 
bodies still clear mostly because I ran
it<00:00:41.010> without<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.430> body<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:41.910> don't<00:00:42.899> think<00:00:43.200> that

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
it without the body I don't think that

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.130 
it without the body I don't think that

these<00:02:37.190> shocks<00:02:37.459> a<00:02:37.580> while<00:02:37.730> ago<00:02:38.000> did<00:02:38.269> a<00:02:38.299> little

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
these shocks a while ago did a little

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.690 
these shocks a while ago did a little
ravit<00:02:38.810> now<00:02:39.049> reviewing<00:02:39.440> yeah<00:02:40.280> I<00:02:40.340> think<00:02:40.430> those

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
ravit now reviewing yeah I think those

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.800 
ravit now reviewing yeah I think those
are<00:02:40.880> all<00:02:40.910> of<00:02:41.030> you<00:02:42.640> and<00:02:43.640> I'm<00:02:44.180> gonna<00:02:44.329> turn<00:02:44.630> this

off so you guys can see there is

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.390 
off so you guys can see there is
absolutely<00:02:50.870> no<00:02:51.290> leaking<00:02:51.799> on<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.099> shocks

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
absolutely no leaking on the shocks

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.530 
absolutely no leaking on the shocks
whatsoever<00:02:53.090> and<00:02:53.390> I've<00:02:53.510> had<00:02:53.690> them<00:02:53.959> for<00:02:55.420> maybe<00:02:56.420> a

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
whatsoever and I've had them for maybe a

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:03.339 
whatsoever and I've had them for maybe a
month<00:02:56.930> now<00:03:01.810> sorry<00:03:02.810> I'm<00:03:02.959> just<00:03:03.110> trying<00:03:03.200> to

month now sorry I'm just trying to

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:04.780 
month now sorry I'm just trying to
figure<00:03:03.530> something<00:03:03.799> up<00:03:04.099> you<00:03:04.430> guys<00:03:04.549> are<00:03:04.700> gonna

figure something up you guys are gonna

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:17.289 
figure something up you guys are gonna
have<00:03:04.940> to<00:03:05.000> hold<00:03:05.180> on<00:03:05.299> walk<00:03:05.450> with<00:03:15.549> me<00:03:16.549> okay<00:03:16.790> so

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
have to hold on walk with me okay so

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.449 
have to hold on walk with me okay so
they've<00:03:17.569> shown<00:03:18.049> absolutely<00:03:18.290> no<00:03:18.769> signs<00:03:19.310> of

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
they've shown absolutely no signs of

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.449 
they've shown absolutely no signs of
leaking<00:03:19.819> yet<00:03:20.000> which<00:03:20.269> is<00:03:20.450> great<00:03:20.980> there's<00:03:21.980> a<00:03:22.130> GM

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
leaking yet which is great there's a GM

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:27.370 
leaking yet which is great there's a GM
8x<00:03:22.760> DP<00:03:23.090> -<00:03:23.359> shocks<00:03:23.799> and<00:03:24.799> in<00:03:25.519> this<00:03:26.480> car<00:03:26.780> they<00:03:27.109> fit

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
8x DP - shocks and in this car they fit

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.009 
8x DP - shocks and in this car they fit
perfectly<00:03:27.920> I<00:03:28.190> got<00:03:28.489> the<00:03:28.730> melody<00:03:29.239> millimeter<00:03:29.810> or

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
perfectly I got the melody millimeter or

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.530 
perfectly I got the melody millimeter or
the<00:03:30.170> 93<00:03:30.769> or<00:03:30.889> whatever<00:03:31.220> it<00:03:31.459> is<00:03:31.609> it's<00:03:32.269> around

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
the 93 or whatever it is it's around

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.009 
the 93 or whatever it is it's around
there<00:03:32.750> and<00:03:33.290> one<00:03:34.250> they<00:03:34.609> look<00:03:34.910> amazing<00:03:35.480> as<00:03:35.780> you

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
there and one they look amazing as you

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.420 
there and one they look amazing as you
can<00:03:36.170> see<00:03:36.319> from<00:03:36.470> here<00:03:37.120> they<00:03:38.120> look<00:03:38.450> great<00:03:38.840> and

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
can see from here they look great and

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:45.129 
can see from here they look great and
they<00:03:40.540> function<00:03:41.540> amazing<00:03:43.060> I<00:03:44.060> got<00:03:44.630> them<00:03:44.870> to<00:03:45.049> the

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139 
they function amazing I got them to the

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:47.920 
they function amazing I got them to the
point<00:03:45.169> where<00:03:45.849> this<00:03:46.849> boot<00:03:47.150> isn't<00:03:47.510> completely

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
point where this boot isn't completely

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.409 
point where this boot isn't completely
protruding<00:03:48.680> but<00:03:49.549> it's<00:03:49.849> pretty<00:03:50.510> damn<00:03:51.319> close<00:03:51.650> to

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:52.419 
protruding but it's pretty damn close to

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:55.240 
protruding but it's pretty damn close to
being<00:03:53.419> screwed<00:03:53.930> in<00:03:54.079> all<00:03:54.230> the<00:03:54.319> way<00:03:54.440> so<00:03:54.980> that's

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
being screwed in all the way so that's

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.800 
being screwed in all the way so that's
how<00:03:56.180> I<00:03:56.209> set<00:03:56.569> mine<00:03:56.780> up<00:03:58.209> but<00:03:59.209> let's<00:03:59.419> get<00:03:59.510> back<00:03:59.569> to

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
how I set mine up but let's get back to

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.449 
how I set mine up but let's get back to
the<00:03:59.930> little<00:04:00.139> let's<00:04:00.769> get<00:04:00.889> back<00:04:01.010> to<00:04:01.130> the<00:04:01.220> servo

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
the little let's get back to the servo

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:02.500 
the little let's get back to the servo
because<00:04:01.700> I<00:04:01.730> really<00:04:02.000> haven't<00:04:02.150> talked<00:04:02.419> much

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
because I really haven't talked much

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.110 
because I really haven't talked much
about<00:04:02.630> this<00:04:03.019> so<00:04:03.829> every<00:04:04.459> situation<00:04:05.000> I've

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
about this so every situation I've

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.370 
about this so every situation I've
gotten<00:04:05.389> into<00:04:05.630> where<00:04:05.810> the<00:04:05.900> wheels<00:04:06.109> get<00:04:06.349> a

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
gotten into where the wheels get a

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.250 
gotten into where the wheels get a
little<00:04:06.680> bit<00:04:06.769> stuck<00:04:07.180> I've<00:04:08.180> been<00:04:08.480> able<00:04:08.630> to<00:04:08.780> just

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
little bit stuck I've been able to just

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.099 
little bit stuck I've been able to just
power<00:04:09.530> out<00:04:09.650> of<00:04:09.980> it<00:04:10.130> from<00:04:11.060> the<00:04:11.510> motor<00:04:11.780> that<00:04:12.049> I

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:12.109 
power out of it from the motor that I

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:16.659 
power out of it from the motor that I
did<00:04:13.569> unboxing<00:04:14.569> on<00:04:14.660> and<00:04:15.039> also<00:04:16.039> because<00:04:16.400> this

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
did unboxing on and also because this

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:19.310 
did unboxing on and also because this
thing<00:04:16.880> has<00:04:17.090> just<00:04:17.120> so<00:04:17.599> much<00:04:17.780> torque<00:04:18.169> I<00:04:18.409> haven't

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
thing has just so much torque I haven't

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.280 
thing has just so much torque I haven't
napped<00:04:19.530> anything<00:04:20.040> yet<00:04:20.400> it's<00:04:20.520> not<00:04:20.790> like<00:04:20.970> it's

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
napped anything yet it's not like it's

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.140 
napped anything yet it's not like it's
400<00:04:22.310> bouncing<00:04:23.310> to<00:04:23.460> the<00:04:23.490> torque<00:04:23.880> or<00:04:24.000> anything

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
400 bouncing to the torque or anything

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.940 
400 bouncing to the torque or anything
it's<00:04:24.900> still<00:04:25.260> only<00:04:25.470> 208<00:04:26.280> at<00:04:26.730> 6<00:04:27.090> volts<00:04:27.420> but<00:04:27.660> at<00:04:28.560> 6

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
it's still only 208 at 6 volts but at 6

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.610 
it's still only 208 at 6 volts but at 6
volts<00:04:29.340> 208<00:04:30.060> ounce<00:04:30.300> inches<00:04:30.750> and<00:04:30.990> the<00:04:31.230> servo

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
volts 208 ounce inches and the servo

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.960 
volts 208 ounce inches and the servo
cost<00:04:31.860> me<00:04:32.660> 50<00:04:33.710> that's<00:04:34.710> really<00:04:35.430> great<00:04:35.670> for<00:04:35.730> a

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
cost me 50 that's really great for a

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.970 
cost me 50 that's really great for a
waterproof<00:04:36.420> servo<00:04:36.810> it's<00:04:37.260> a<00:04:37.320> tiny<00:04:37.560> bit<00:04:37.740> taller

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
waterproof servo it's a tiny bit taller

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.460 
waterproof servo it's a tiny bit taller
than<00:04:38.130> all<00:04:38.400> the<00:04:38.430> others<00:04:38.820> but<00:04:39.120> it<00:04:39.960> fits<00:04:40.350> into

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
than all the others but it fits into

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.590 
than all the others but it fits into
this<00:04:40.740> truck<00:04:40.980> perfectly<00:04:41.490> I<00:04:41.670> think<00:04:42.210> that's<00:04:42.390> what

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
this truck perfectly I think that's what

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.530 
this truck perfectly I think that's what
it<00:04:42.690> was<00:04:42.810> built<00:04:42.990> for<00:04:43.190> waterproof<00:04:44.190> crawlers<00:04:44.670> or

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
it was built for waterproof crawlers or

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.090 
it was built for waterproof crawlers or
something<00:04:45.900> similar<00:04:46.380> to<00:04:46.620> that<00:04:46.740> because<00:04:46.860> it's

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
something similar to that because it's

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:53.480 
something similar to that because it's
not<00:04:47.250> very<00:04:47.280> fast<00:04:47.610> the<00:04:48.120> wheels<00:04:48.270> maybe<00:04:48.540> you<00:04:52.490> know

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
not very fast the wheels maybe you know

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.190 
not very fast the wheels maybe you know
the<00:04:53.700> spring<00:04:54.060> they<00:04:54.450> move<00:04:54.630> probably<00:04:54.780> look<00:04:55.170> like

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
the spring they move probably look like

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.380 
the spring they move probably look like
twice<00:04:55.740> as<00:04:55.920> fast<00:04:56.160> as<00:04:56.370> that<00:04:56.400> but<00:04:56.790> it's<00:04:56.910> not<00:04:57.120> like

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
twice as fast as that but it's not like

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:03.980 
twice as fast as that but it's not like
it's<00:04:57.630> really<00:04:58.140> fast<00:04:58.550> um<00:05:00.200> so<00:05:01.200> I<00:05:01.940> so<00:05:02.940> far<00:05:03.210> from

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
it's really fast um so I so far from

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.350
