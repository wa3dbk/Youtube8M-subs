 tons per year pure waters figure skating then 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.590
 have it end in terms of 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.170
 lover of warehouses 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.740

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.160
 your pleasure but in indicative 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.980
 performances so i know is it worth it at all 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.130
 need this figure skating russian 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.359
 new leader 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:22.329
 does not need and would like him to 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:23.099
 appeared 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:25.159
 fortune lucky he has such 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:26.919
 let's say so sparring partner like marrying 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:27.909
 plushenko 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:30.449
 but how did he train with him 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.420
 and then look at his wife 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.360
 but of course when you are in front of you 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.980
 the only brilliant skater is you 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.720
 can you quietly so that 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.420
 going through starting 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.170
 elements of technology ending it 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.030
 psychology 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.110
 tune in to workout like him 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.600
 conducts these workouts so he 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.120
 conducts microcycles and of course arthur is 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.860
 helps to develop yourself 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.630
 but they are so warm and so with 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.680
 respect movement 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.110
 from friendship from a large percentage of that so far 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.830
 I thought it was too early to say that she had 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.830
 in general, in principle, there are any 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.660
 go out to compete 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.550
 you stand wins 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.550
 It all depends on you 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.010
 it's always hard 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.280
 double between them just won't be they 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.800
 are friends 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.850
 as far as possible friendship in 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.510
 professional sports 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.180
 help each other play football together 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.620
 communicates 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.370
 but unless someone will be against if absolutely 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.550
 soon they will share one golden 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.550
 medal leaving the rest of the world 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.050
 that's how we work 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.710
 there's nothing here 

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:23.389
 for its turn the sport studio is not worth 

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:25.499
 latest sport sedan 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:27.649
 minute in our issue main theme 

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:30.649
 sound like this 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:33.529
 first set of medals of Moscow 

00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:35.359
 the world championships will be played by men this 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:37.229
 our artur will happen very soon 

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:38.209
 Gachinsky one of the real 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.359
 applicants 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:41.430
 amid this year 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.370
 where she trains in bratislava on high 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.980
 speeds 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.980
 I know for now, however, will be captain 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:49.749
 A visit to Belgrade as a spectator 

00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:51.839
 possible but football especially when playing 

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:54.179
 its implementation 

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:57.179
 bank 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.439
 black gold stays until the exit to 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:01.489
 ice arena megasport men each of 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:02.519
 which its arbitrary 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.449
 programs will try to prove what 

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:07.889
 he got a skater in the world 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:10.439
 in place a grand event works our 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:12.319
 correspondent Dmitry Sanin all 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.929
 hi i see you already at the edge of the ice why 

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:16.399
 no triple sheepskin coat 

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:18.299
 Minister this work here already Ltd. 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.089
 the fourth day on the first days was at 

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:21.149
 Jacket yesterday was 

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:23.209
 vests today in one shirt because 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:24.799
 that the doctors are closer to the denouement 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.399
 Competition so hotter than hotter 

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:28.269
 here it becomes even afraid to imagine that 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.649
 here will be tomorrow 

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:32.229
 here is a very warm atmosphere 

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:34.509
 it is very warm here and in the evening the house will be still 

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:36.509
 hotter and how many already in the stands 

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:38.449
 fan of arthur gachinsky or 

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:39.789
 dominated by the army 

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:42.479
 their fans 

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:43.699
 me a rohatinsky map 

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:45.629
 distinctiveness is still very far early 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:47.270
 when your popularity is donetsk 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:48.480
 but nevertheless these guys themselves 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.250
 fans in a number narrow surprise 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.740
 appeared but now find experience 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.980
 decided the tap he said he saw the ball 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.290
 news and imagine did not 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.090
 look at the loan and you just missed 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.419
 so there are already some advantages 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:01.879
 the length i'm sure the book is extremely sport 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:03.809
 This heavenly your fan but now 

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:06.009
 please tell me what the results of the short 

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:07.739
 programs for what we should wait 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.009
 filing claims to the program 

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:10.299
 arbitrary 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.089
 but I'll start with the fact that it is always short 

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:13.749
 the program was very intense 

00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:15.149
 atmosphere because 

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:17.479
 the network skater did not pass very collected 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:19.259
 not to this start alexey mishin then 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:21.589
 after the end of yesterday's program with 

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:23.259
 the fact that it was a real meat grinder 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:25.319
 but also as an example of Brian 

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:27.330
 joubera most experienced on skater one of 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.379
 most titled 

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:30.200
 from those who I come here to Moscow 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.910
 he said he was just really 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.300
 worried sg thas blew off his program 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.660
 above 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.450
 so how is the reverse example patrick chan 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.810
 which he skated just brilliantly 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.380
 and appearance to himself what we 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.780
 also said in an interview laura believed 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.750
 at least score 90 premiere points 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.940
 eventually scored 93 points what has become new 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.660
 world record short program 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.050
 Nobunari Oda the third 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.110
 acting world peace dysuke takahashi but 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.890
 the main thing that interests us is 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.790
 naturally simply sang Artur Gachinsky 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.300
 percentage program directory practically 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.430
 brilliantly if not one blot on 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.900
 landing of which itself 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.500
 spoiled him all assessment and when 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.920
 announced the results of speeches arthur 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.860
 Hachinsky we filed a second rule 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.650
 The option showed that he is happy while 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:14.830
 Misha on the contrary 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.879
 we note that this is far from brilliant 

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:18.860
 result he expected turnout on 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:19.650
 more 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.470
 we want a program today 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:22.750
 quite difficult start to grow 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.620
 Smirnova club then will 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.360
 two triple axel and one of them 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.580
 the cascade is very 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.900
 I will note that he answered the program 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:31.939
 tourist home 

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:33.449
 need to save the TV project 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:35.429
 optical each quadruple toe loop will be 

00:05:35.429 --> 00:05:38.309
 every second athlete and 

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:39.669
 according to experts such 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:41.369
 situations usually come first 

00:05:41.369 --> 00:05:43.689
 go to the psychological 

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:45.259
 sustainability but with this already 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:47.330
 problem of our skaters after 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.139
 which lasted up to 3 years 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:50.870
 and sometimes it seemed that it was just a man 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.090
 iron nerves and meanwhile do not recall 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.129
 just 17 years old and here 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:57.279
 Well, I hope today m 

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:58.159
 continue 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:00.550
 Zhu kid and such iron ore 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.979
 Lena Artur Gachinsky will show brilliant 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:04.819
 performance 

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:05.639
 instead 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:08.639
 higher fourth still want medals 

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:11.639
 but we have to hope so much thank you Dima 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:12.300
 it was our correspondent 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.969

 free program men we 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:19.880
 We will be rooting for the Russian figure skater 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.729
 Arthur Hachinsky 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:23.689
 better determined today in the pair 

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:25.409
 skating and those who are closest to gold 

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:25.959
 experience
