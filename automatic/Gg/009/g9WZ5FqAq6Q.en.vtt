just kind of show you here how the key

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.880 
just kind of show you here how the key
bar<00:02:42.800> works<00:02:43.630> the<00:02:44.630> easiest<00:02:44.930> way<00:02:45.170> is<00:02:45.470> going<00:02:45.650> to<00:02:45.709> be

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
bar works the easiest way is going to be

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.949 
bar works the easiest way is going to be
do<00:02:46.280> one<00:02:46.490> side<00:02:46.670> at<00:02:46.730> a<00:02:46.850> time<00:02:46.910> that's<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.690> trick

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
do one side at a time that's the trick

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.650 
do one side at a time that's the trick
so<00:02:48.500> you're<00:02:48.770> going<00:02:48.890> to<00:02:48.950> get<00:02:49.040> a<00:02:49.100> screw<00:02:49.660> this

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
so you're going to get a screw this

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:51.940 
so you're going to get a screw this
thing<00:02:50.720> will<00:02:50.990> already<00:02:51.260> come<00:02:51.440> together<00:02:51.709> it'll

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
thing will already come together it'll

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.670 
thing will already come together it'll
come<00:02:52.130> just<00:02:52.400> like<00:02:52.490> this<00:02:52.959> already<00:02:53.959> inserted<00:02:54.410> are

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
come just like this already inserted are

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.949 
come just like this already inserted are

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
the short screws you get longer screws

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.140 
the short screws you get longer screws
and<00:02:57.290> a<00:02:57.650> little<00:02:57.890> baggie<00:02:58.070> the<00:02:58.520> longer<00:02:58.850> screws

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
and a little baggie the longer screws

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.120 
and a little baggie the longer screws
will<00:02:59.330> hold<00:02:59.540> up<00:02:59.750> to<00:02:59.780> 10<00:03:00.110> keys<00:03:00.410> the<00:03:00.650> short<00:03:00.920> ones

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
will hold up to 10 keys the short ones

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.030 
will hold up to 10 keys the short ones
up<00:03:01.370> to<00:03:01.700> 5<00:03:01.940> keys<00:03:02.560> so<00:03:03.560> you're<00:03:03.650> gonna<00:03:03.739> take<00:03:03.890> your

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
the hole and again do one side at the

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.430 
the hole and again do one side at the
time<00:03:13.040> you<00:03:13.880> can<00:03:14.060> use<00:03:14.209> washers<00:03:14.810> to<00:03:14.989> fill<00:03:15.200> any

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
time you can use washers to fill any

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.050 
time you can use washers to fill any
gaps<00:03:15.500> in<00:03:15.980> between<00:03:16.010> your<00:03:16.400> screws<00:03:16.790> or<00:03:18.910> to<00:03:19.910> make

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
gaps in between your screws or to make

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.050 
gaps in between your screws or to make
spots<00:03:20.420> for<00:03:20.810> stuff<00:03:21.080> like<00:03:21.290> the<00:03:21.830> flash<00:03:22.130> drive<00:03:22.160> so

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
spots for stuff like the flash drive so

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.520 
spots for stuff like the flash drive so
the<00:03:23.239> flash<00:03:23.480> drive<00:03:23.750> is<00:03:23.840> going<00:03:23.930> to<00:03:24.050> need<00:03:24.230> a

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
the flash drive is going to need a

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.890 
the flash drive is going to need a
little<00:03:24.830> gap<00:03:25.100> there<00:03:25.400> to<00:03:26.030> fall<00:03:26.239> in<00:03:26.360> between<00:03:26.510> peas

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
little gap there to fall in between peas

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.430 
little gap there to fall in between peas
so<00:03:27.590> you<00:03:27.709> just<00:03:27.769> use<00:03:28.040> washers<00:03:28.519> to<00:03:28.730> make<00:03:28.850> it<00:03:29.000> go

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
so you just use washers to make it go

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.449 
so you just use washers to make it go
it's<00:03:30.440> pretty<00:03:30.650> simple<00:03:30.920> it's<00:03:31.070> going<00:03:31.250> to<00:03:31.310> take

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
it's pretty simple it's going to take

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.580 
it's pretty simple it's going to take
you<00:03:31.580> a<00:03:31.640> couple<00:03:31.670> tries<00:03:32.180> to<00:03:32.510> figure<00:03:32.720> out<00:03:33.019> how<00:03:33.530> you

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
you a couple tries to figure out how you

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.550 
you a couple tries to figure out how you
like<00:03:33.890> it<00:03:33.920> and<00:03:34.390> also<00:03:35.390> when<00:03:35.930> you<00:03:35.989> put<00:03:36.170> your<00:03:36.200> keys

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
like it and also when you put your keys

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.759 
like it and also when you put your keys
in<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:38.090> way<00:03:38.239> it's<00:03:38.390> cut<00:03:38.600> out<00:03:38.780> is<00:03:39.320> so<00:03:39.560> you<00:03:39.650> can

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
in the way it's cut out is so you can

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.229 
in the way it's cut out is so you can
roll<00:03:39.950> your<00:03:39.980> finger<00:03:40.430> across<00:03:40.489> to<00:03:40.910> push<00:03:41.090> your

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:42.940 
roll your finger across to push your
keys<00:03:41.510> out<00:03:41.660> so<00:03:42.320> you're<00:03:42.410> gonna<00:03:42.500> want<00:03:42.709> the<00:03:42.769> teeth

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
don't stick out you can do it the other

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.890 
don't stick out you can do it the other
way<00:03:52.310> some<00:03:52.670> people<00:03:52.970> prefer<00:03:53.330> the<00:03:53.630> other<00:03:53.660> way

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
way some people prefer the other way

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.420 
way some people prefer the other way
they<00:03:54.080> actually<00:03:54.230> tuck<00:03:54.590> in<00:03:54.769> a<00:03:54.980> little<00:03:55.220> better

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
the other way but I found this it's the

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.620 
the other way but I found this it's the
easiest<00:03:57.410> way<00:03:57.590> to<00:03:57.650> deploy<00:03:58.100> heat<00:03:58.430> so<00:03:59.390> anyway

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
easiest way to deploy heat so anyway
