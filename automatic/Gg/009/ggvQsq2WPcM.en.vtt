you use anything less than two

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.680 
you use anything less than two
repetitions<00:02:51.860> it's<00:02:52.519> not<00:02:53.000> enough<00:02:53.239> stress<00:02:53.540> on

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
repetitions it's not enough stress on

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:54.910 
repetitions it's not enough stress on
the<00:02:53.810> body<00:02:53.930> and<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.230> central<00:02:54.620> nervous<00:02:54.650> system

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
the body and the central nervous system

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.550 
the body and the central nervous system
to<00:02:55.760> provide<00:02:56.090> a<00:02:56.120> positive<00:02:56.720> response<00:02:56.959> and<00:02:57.410> when

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
to provide a positive response and when

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.339 
to provide a positive response and when
you<00:02:57.680> go<00:02:57.890> past<00:02:58.160> four<00:02:58.790> and<00:02:59.090> get<00:02:59.540> into<00:02:59.780> five<00:02:59.989> six

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
you go past four and get into five six

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:02.740 
you go past four and get into five six
and<00:03:00.500> so<00:03:00.680> on<00:03:00.709> it's<00:03:01.700> too<00:03:01.940> much<00:03:02.120> of<00:03:02.239> a<00:03:02.329> stress<00:03:02.599> on

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
and so on it's too much of a stress on

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.300 
and so on it's too much of a stress on
the<00:03:02.870> nervous<00:03:03.049> system<00:03:03.530> that's<00:03:03.680> when<00:03:03.920> fatigue

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.500 
sets in and in all likelihood your form
is<00:03:06.680> starting<00:03:06.980> to<00:03:07.099> break<00:03:07.310> and<00:03:07.579> when<00:03:08.120> your<00:03:08.239> form

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
is starting to break and when your form

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:09.759 
is starting to break and when your form
breaks<00:03:08.780> you<00:03:08.959> just<00:03:08.989> need<00:03:09.290> to<00:03:09.380> shut<00:03:09.620> it<00:03:09.739> down

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
breaks you just need to shut it down

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.770 
breaks you just need to shut it down
because<00:03:10.280> then<00:03:10.489> you<00:03:10.610> start<00:03:10.670> reinforcing<00:03:11.180> a

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
because then you start reinforcing a

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.020 
because then you start reinforcing a
negative<00:03:12.709> motor<00:03:13.040> pattern<00:03:13.459> and<00:03:13.670> that's<00:03:13.790> not

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
negative motor pattern and that's not

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.089 
negative motor pattern and that's not
good<00:03:14.329> you're<00:03:14.930> really<00:03:15.140> opening<00:03:15.530> yourself<00:03:15.950> up

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
good you're really opening yourself up

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:20.229

sets<00:04:40.670> of<00:04:40.760> three<00:04:41.030> and<00:04:41.240> then<00:04:41.390> you'd<00:04:41.570> land<00:04:41.810> right

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
sets of three and then you'd land right

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.770 
sets of three and then you'd land right
on<00:04:42.050> 15<00:04:42.620> so<00:04:43.040> it<00:04:43.400> helps<00:04:43.700> to<00:04:43.760> land<00:04:44.030> on<00:04:44.180> 15<00:04:44.600> that's

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
on 15 so it helps to land on 15 that's

would make for power lifters is when you

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.090 
would make for power lifters is when you
get<00:05:01.790> into<00:05:02.000> this<00:05:02.120> 90<00:05:02.540> percent<00:05:02.930> plus<00:05:03.230> range<00:05:03.560> you

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
get into this 90 percent plus range you

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.410 
get into this 90 percent plus range you
really<00:05:04.370> only<00:05:04.520> need<00:05:04.610> to<00:05:04.790> be<00:05:04.880> concerned<00:05:05.270> with

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:05.420 
really only need to be concerned with

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.380 
really only need to be concerned with
your<00:05:06.080> reps<00:05:06.290> per<00:05:06.560> set<00:05:06.800> we<00:05:07.310> never<00:05:07.670> take<00:05:07.970> more

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390 
your reps per set we never take more

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.430 
your reps per set we never take more
than<00:05:09.170> a<00:05:09.230> maximum<00:05:09.830> of<00:05:10.010> three<00:05:10.370> singles<00:05:10.880> that<00:05:11.630> 90%

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
than a maximum of three singles that 90%

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.980 
than a maximum of three singles that 90%
are<00:05:12.590> above<00:05:12.860> so<00:05:13.340> if<00:05:14.180> you're<00:05:14.360> a<00:05:14.390> power<00:05:14.630> lifter

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
are above so if you're a power lifter

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.410 
are above so if you're a power lifter
don't<00:05:15.500> pay<00:05:15.650> any<00:05:15.770> attention<00:05:16.130> to<00:05:16.520> the<00:05:16.700> range<00:05:16.940> or

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:17.420 
don't pay any attention to the range or

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.270 
don't pay any attention to the range or
the<00:05:17.540> optimal<00:05:17.960> total<00:05:18.290> when<00:05:18.680> operating<00:05:19.190> at

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
the optimal total when operating at

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.520 
the optimal total when operating at
loads<00:05:19.490> of<00:05:19.670> 90<00:05:19.940> percent<00:05:20.330> and<00:05:20.420> above<00:05:20.660> Olympic

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
loads of 90 percent and above Olympic

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.530 
loads of 90 percent and above Olympic
weightlifters<00:05:22.340> do<00:05:22.880> the<00:05:23.030> snatch<00:05:23.270> and<00:05:23.510> the

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:23.540 
weightlifters do the snatch and the

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:24.880 
weightlifters do the snatch and the
clean<00:05:23.600> and<00:05:23.900> jerk<00:05:23.930> and<00:05:24.320> therefore<00:05:24.710> they

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:24.890 
clean and jerk and therefore they

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:26.560 
clean and jerk and therefore they
usually<00:05:25.130> drop<00:05:25.520> those<00:05:25.760> lifts<00:05:26.060> from<00:05:26.120> overhead

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
usually drop those lifts from overhead

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.180 
usually drop those lifts from overhead
and<00:05:26.690> they<00:05:26.750> have<00:05:26.900> no<00:05:27.110> eccentric<00:05:27.650> portion<00:05:28.070> or

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
and they have no eccentric portion or

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.670 
and they have no eccentric portion or
negative<00:05:28.520> portion<00:05:28.820> of<00:05:28.910> the<00:05:29.000> lift<00:05:29.210> so<00:05:29.750> the

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
negative portion of the lift so the

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.140 
negative portion of the lift so the
stress<00:05:30.980> on<00:05:31.100> the<00:05:31.220> nervous<00:05:31.400> system<00:05:31.880> and<00:05:32.030> their

stress on the nervous system and their
muscle<00:05:32.480> soreness<00:05:32.720> that<00:05:32.870> they<00:05:33.110> get<00:05:33.290> is<00:05:33.470> a<00:05:33.500> lot

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
muscle soreness that they get is a lot

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.830 
muscle soreness that they get is a lot
less<00:05:34.220> than<00:05:34.550> strength<00:05:34.940> athletes<00:05:35.390> that<00:05:35.600> have

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840
