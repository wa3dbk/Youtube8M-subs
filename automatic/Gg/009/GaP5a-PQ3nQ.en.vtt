right<00:00:51.960> now<00:00:52.110> but<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.590> have<00:00:52.800> mathematically

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
right now but I have mathematically

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.979 
right now but I have mathematically
determined<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.210> is<00:00:54.329> going<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.660> be<00:00:54.690> off

the<00:00:55.620> chain<00:00:56.840> basically<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.050> idea<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.590> if

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
the chain basically the idea is that if

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.709 
the chain basically the idea is that if
you<00:00:58.949> deploy<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.550> dt<00:00:59.940> unit<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.480> school

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719
