hey<00:00:01.860> YouTube<00:00:02.460> I<00:00:02.850> thought<00:00:03.510> you<00:00:03.659> might<00:00:03.840> like<00:00:03.870> to

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:06.020 
hey YouTube I thought you might like to

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.790 
hey YouTube I thought you might like to
see<00:00:07.020> the<00:00:07.170> insides<00:00:07.799> of<00:00:08.130> my<00:00:08.160> rocks<00:00:08.580> Ted<00:00:09.800> since

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
see the insides of my rocks Ted since

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.419 
see the insides of my rocks Ted since
you<00:00:11.190> hardly<00:00:11.880> ever<00:00:11.969> see<00:00:12.389> them<00:00:12.509> taking<00:00:12.870> apart

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:13.429 
you hardly ever see them taking apart

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:19.269 
you hardly ever see them taking apart
this<00:00:14.429> actually<00:00:15.000> voids<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.480> warranty<00:00:15.540> so<00:00:16.410> well

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:19.279 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.759 

that<00:00:20.279> strange<00:00:20.760> they<00:00:20.970> give<00:00:21.150> you<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.529> wrench<00:00:22.529> to

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
that strange they give you a wrench to

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.609 
that strange they give you a wrench to
take<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.100> apart<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.880> adjust<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:25.080> screws<00:00:25.439> with

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
take it apart to adjust the screws with

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.200 
take it apart to adjust the screws with
but<00:00:28.619> then<00:00:28.830> that<00:00:29.039> voids<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.460> warranty<00:00:29.550> you

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
but then that voids the warranty you

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.260 
but then that voids the warranty you
would<00:00:30.359> think<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:31.730> taking<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:32.820> apart<00:00:33.090> and

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
would think that taking it apart and

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.810 
would think that taking it apart and
properly<00:00:33.660> cleaning<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.350> would<00:00:34.530> actually<00:00:34.820> help

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
properly cleaning it would actually help

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.549 
properly cleaning it would actually help
the<00:00:36.090> knife<00:00:37.040> rather<00:00:38.040> than<00:00:38.309> just<00:00:38.579> letting<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.000> go

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
the knife rather than just letting it go

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.639 
the knife rather than just letting it go
I<00:00:41.180> carry<00:00:42.180> this<00:00:42.360> every<00:00:42.719> single<00:00:42.989> day

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
I carry this every single day

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:52.250 
I carry this every single day
I<00:00:44.300> use<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:46.100> the<00:00:47.840> zdp<00:00:48.840> 189<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:50.280> so<00:00:50.550> hard<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:51.260> it

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
I use it the zdp 189 is so hard that it

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.049 
I use it the zdp 189 is so hard that it
doesn't<00:00:52.649> show<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.890> lot<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.280> scratches<00:00:53.850> now<00:00:54.000> you

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
doesn't show a lot of scratches now you

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.049 
doesn't show a lot of scratches now you
can't<00:00:54.539> really<00:00:54.629> see<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.289> but<00:00:56.100> maybe<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.610> can<00:00:56.820> on

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
can't really see it but maybe you can on

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.670 
can't really see it but maybe you can on
the<00:00:57.180> video<00:00:57.449> there<00:00:57.750> are<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.440> couple<00:01:00.680> extremely

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
the video there are a couple extremely

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:10.000 
the video there are a couple extremely
my<00:01:01.859> new<00:01:02.149> surface<00:01:03.149> scratches<00:01:07.130> but<00:01:08.130> I've<00:01:08.280> cut

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
my new surface scratches but I've cut

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.410 
my new surface scratches but I've cut
cardboard<00:01:11.010> I've<00:01:11.369> cut<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.610> lot<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:11.820> stuff<00:01:12.030> with

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
cardboard I've cut a lot of stuff with

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.929 
cardboard I've cut a lot of stuff with
it<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.900> think<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.590> will<00:01:13.979> scratch<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.520> up<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.760> lot

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
it I think that will scratch it up a lot

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:21.370 
it I think that will scratch it up a lot
more<00:01:15.210> when<00:01:15.509> we<00:01:16.400> do<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:19.490> large<00:01:20.490> test<00:01:20.939> with<00:01:21.299> it

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
more when we do the large test with it

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.190 
more when we do the large test with it
we're<00:01:22.380> going<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:23.210> use<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.479> against<00:01:24.930> some

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
we're going to use this against some

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.789 
we're going to use this against some
comparable<00:01:25.979> knives<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:27.210> zdp<00:01:27.960> 180th<00:01:28.560> not

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
comparable knives and zdp 180th not

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.850 
comparable knives and zdp 180th not
comparable<00:01:29.990> so<00:01:30.990> much<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.350> knife<00:01:31.560> but

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
comparable so much the knife but

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.800 
comparable so much the knife but
comparable<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.700> fact<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:33.090> there's<00:01:33.329> EDP

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
comparable in the fact that there's EDP

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.780 
comparable in the fact that there's EDP
189<00:01:34.640> and<00:01:36.560> I'm<00:01:37.560> sure<00:01:37.799> it'll<00:01:38.009> scratch<00:01:38.310> up<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.640> lot

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
189 and I'm sure it'll scratch up a lot

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.649 
189 and I'm sure it'll scratch up a lot
more<00:01:39.000> then<00:01:40.460> not<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.490> whole<00:01:41.729> lot<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:41.970> parts<00:01:42.420> to

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
more then not a whole lot of parts to

that<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.880> pick<00:01:57.590> and<00:01:58.590> that's<00:01:59.219> it

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
that you pick and that's it

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.359 
that you pick and that's it
the<00:02:00.780> one<00:02:01.140> thing<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.619> did<00:02:01.829> notice<00:02:02.070> on

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
the one thing that I did notice on

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.670 
the one thing that I did notice on
taking<00:02:02.820> this<00:02:02.909> apart<00:02:03.299> that<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:03.689> don't<00:02:04.320> think<00:02:04.560> I

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
taking this apart that I don't think I

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.270 
taking this apart that I don't think I
covered<00:02:05.100> in<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.610> video<00:02:06.270> is<00:02:06.899> that<00:02:07.680> on<00:02:07.920> this

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
covered in the video is that on this

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.850 
covered in the video is that on this
piece

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.510 

which<00:02:12.860> is<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.730> hardened<00:02:14.690> steel<00:02:14.960> face<00:02:15.320> for<00:02:15.770> the

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.960 

white<00:02:19.520> bar<00:02:19.850> this<00:02:20.720> actually<00:02:21.230> extends<00:02:21.800> down<00:02:22.040> and

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
white bar this actually extends down and

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.390 
white bar this actually extends down and
there's<00:02:23.540> a<00:02:23.600> milled<00:02:23.930> area<00:02:24.410> beneath<00:02:24.650> it<00:02:25.070> but<00:02:25.280> you

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
there's a milled area beneath it but you

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.010 
there's a milled area beneath it but you
can<00:02:25.490> probably<00:02:25.730> see<00:02:26.030> pretty<00:02:26.300> good<00:02:26.510> right<00:02:26.750> there

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
can probably see pretty good right there

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.250 
can probably see pretty good right there
and<00:02:27.470> that's<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.310> over<00:02:28.550> travel<00:02:28.970> stop<00:02:29.300> so

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
and that's the over travel stop so

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.420 
and that's the over travel stop so
that's<00:02:31.030> built<00:02:32.030> in<00:02:32.300> and<00:02:32.720> and<00:02:33.200> just<00:02:33.500> just

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
that's built in and and just just

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.900 
that's built in and and just just
totally<00:02:34.850> there<00:02:35.090> and<00:02:35.420> hidden<00:02:36.350> and<00:02:36.770> I<00:02:37.010> think

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
totally there and hidden and I think

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.410 
totally there and hidden and I think
pretty<00:02:38.060> cool<00:02:39.040> but<00:02:40.040> this<00:02:40.790> is<00:02:40.910> just<00:02:41.120> a<00:02:41.210> real

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
pretty cool but this is just a real

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.960 
pretty cool but this is just a real
short<00:02:41.870> quick<00:02:42.470> video<00:02:43.250> I<00:02:43.310> just<00:02:43.610> thought<00:02:43.760> you

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
short quick video I just thought you

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.150 
short quick video I just thought you
guys<00:02:44.000> would<00:02:44.180> like<00:02:44.570> to<00:02:44.600> see<00:02:44.780> it's<00:02:45.140> very<00:02:45.440> well

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
guys would like to see it's very well

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.110 
guys would like to see it's very well
finished<00:02:46.430> on<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:46.880> inside<00:02:48.940> pretty<00:02:49.940> well

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120

machined<00:02:50.860> as<00:02:51.860> you<00:02:52.010> would<00:02:52.160> expect<00:02:52.280> a<00:02:52.940> knife<00:02:53.390> of

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
machined as you would expect a knife of

machined as you would expect a knife of
this<00:02:53.810> price<00:02:54.380> range<00:02:54.620> to<00:02:54.980> be<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:57.410> part<00:02:57.680> of<00:02:57.800> the

that this knife is so rigid excuse me
when<00:03:20.450> you<00:03:20.540> put<00:03:20.750> it<00:03:20.840> together<00:03:21.790> considering<00:03:22.790> how

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
when you put it together considering how

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.990 
when you put it together considering how
few<00:03:23.240> parts<00:03:23.720> are<00:03:23.900> on<00:03:24.080> it<00:03:24.350> and<00:03:24.560> how<00:03:25.340> few<00:03:25.580> screws

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
few parts are on it and how few screws

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.970 
few parts are on it and how few screws
you<00:03:26.270> just<00:03:26.510> basically<00:03:27.080> have<00:03:27.290> two<00:03:27.470> screws<00:03:27.770> and

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
you just basically have two screws and

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:28.810 
you just basically have two screws and
hold<00:03:28.160> it<00:03:28.340> together

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
hold it together

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.850 
hold it together
the<00:03:29.390> only<00:03:29.540> other<00:03:29.780> screw<00:03:30.140> is<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:30.380> one<00:03:30.530> for<00:03:30.770> the

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
the only other screw is the one for the

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:36.340 
the only other screw is the one for the
pocket<00:03:31.220> clip<00:03:34.090> but<00:03:35.090> I<00:03:35.120> think<00:03:35.510> part<00:03:35.840> of<00:03:35.930> that<00:03:35.990> is

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
pocket clip but I think part of that is

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.750 
pocket clip but I think part of that is
is<00:03:36.680> due<00:03:37.040> to<00:03:38.000> the<00:03:38.150> fact<00:03:38.420> that<00:03:38.570> these<00:03:39.760> screw

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
is due to the fact that these screw

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.500 
is due to the fact that these screw
holes<00:03:41.000> are<00:03:41.270> countersunk<00:03:43.390> you<00:03:44.390> may<00:03:44.600> notice

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
holes are countersunk you may notice

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:55.030 
holes are countersunk you may notice
that's<00:03:47.510> if<00:03:48.110> we<00:03:48.290> can<00:03:48.320> get<00:03:48.709> a<00:03:48.740> good<00:03:50.110> right<00:03:54.040> here

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
that's if we can get a good right here

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.470 
that's if we can get a good right here
there's<00:03:55.430> a<00:03:55.490> shoulder<00:03:56.060> and<00:03:57.310> that<00:03:58.310> fits<00:03:59.000> into<00:03:59.300> a

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
there's a shoulder and that fits into a

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.460 
there's a shoulder and that fits into a
corresponding<00:03:59.990> recess<00:04:00.800> on<00:04:01.100> the<00:04:01.280> other<00:04:01.459> scale

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
corresponding recess on the other scale

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:08.130 
corresponding recess on the other scale
there<00:04:03.470> is<00:04:03.640> obviously<00:04:04.640> one<00:04:05.030> for<00:04:05.480> the<00:04:06.320> stop<00:04:07.070> and

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
there is obviously one for the stop and

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.350 
there is obviously one for the stop and
then<00:04:09.140> it's<00:04:09.410> a<00:04:10.040> little<00:04:10.640> bit<00:04:10.760> different<00:04:11.000> setup

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
then it's a little bit different setup

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:17.590 
then it's a little bit different setup
for<00:04:11.840> the<00:04:13.959> the<00:04:14.959> main<00:04:15.230> pivot<00:04:16.010> this<00:04:16.370> is<00:04:16.609> machined

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
for the the main pivot this is machined

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.010 
for the the main pivot this is machined
to<00:04:17.930> a<00:04:17.959> size<00:04:18.680> and<00:04:19.220> then<00:04:19.790> what's<00:04:20.210> up<00:04:20.450> solidly

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.020 
to a size and then what's up solidly

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:25.619 
to a size and then what's up solidly
against<00:04:21.500> there<00:04:21.710> so<00:04:22.220> that<00:04:22.310> you<00:04:22.400> can<00:04:22.610> over<00:04:22.910> time

00:04:25.619 --> 00:04:25.629 

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:28.240 

and<00:04:26.629> that's<00:04:27.020> pretty<00:04:27.229> much<00:04:27.439> it<00:04:27.740> so<00:04:27.770> I'm<00:04:28.099> gonna

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
and that's pretty much it so I'm gonna

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.570 
and that's pretty much it so I'm gonna
leave<00:04:28.520> this<00:04:28.729> up<00:04:29.000> with<00:04:29.300> some<00:04:30.400> SuperDuper<00:04:31.400> Lube

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
leave this up with some SuperDuper Lube

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.429 
leave this up with some SuperDuper Lube
and<00:04:31.969> get<00:04:32.300> it<00:04:32.419> back<00:04:32.599> together<00:04:32.810> it<00:04:33.110> was<00:04:33.289> pretty

00:04:33.429 --> 00:04:33.439 
and get it back together it was pretty

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:36.969 
and get it back together it was pretty
dirty<00:04:33.889> when<00:04:34.129> I<00:04:34.159> took<00:04:34.610> it<00:04:35.030> apart<00:04:35.300> I<00:04:35.979> lubricated

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
dirty when I took it apart I lubricated

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:38.980 
dirty when I took it apart I lubricated
a<00:04:37.069> lot<00:04:37.250> because<00:04:37.669> like<00:04:37.879> I<00:04:37.909> said<00:04:38.060> I<00:04:38.240> do<00:04:38.479> use<00:04:38.750> it

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
we shoot the the test of doing some of

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.839 
we shoot the the test of doing some of
the<00:05:09.050> more<00:05:09.199> heavy<00:05:09.440> duty<00:05:09.889> cutting<00:05:10.370> with<00:05:10.639> this

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:10.849 
the more heavy duty cutting with this

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:12.430 
the more heavy duty cutting with this
and<00:05:11.150> we're<00:05:11.270> going<00:05:11.360> to<00:05:11.449> compare<00:05:11.810> it<00:05:11.900> like<00:05:11.930> Assaf

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
and we're going to compare it like Assaf

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.240 
and we're going to compare it like Assaf
found<00:05:12.800> in<00:05:13.810> my<00:05:14.810> other<00:05:15.110> knives<00:05:15.379> three<00:05:15.889> different

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
found in my other knives three different

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.059 
found in my other knives three different
knives<00:05:16.460> that<00:05:16.819> uses<00:05:17.330> EVP<00:05:17.810> 189<00:05:18.469> from<00:05:18.830> three

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:19.069 
knives that uses EVP 189 from three

knives that uses EVP 189 from three
different<00:05:19.270> manufacturers<00:05:20.270> so<00:05:20.629> we'll<00:05:21.099> run

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:22.099 
different manufacturers so we'll run

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:23.980 
different manufacturers so we'll run
them<00:05:22.279> up<00:05:22.490> against<00:05:22.849> this<00:05:23.090> and<00:05:23.150> we'll<00:05:23.569> see<00:05:23.599> how

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
them up against this and we'll see how

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.559 
them up against this and we'll see how
they<00:05:24.199> do<00:05:24.259> I<00:05:24.650> take<00:05:25.250> it<00:05:25.430> easy<00:05:25.610> YouTube<00:05:26.120> and<00:05:26.389> we'll

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:26.569 
they do I take it easy YouTube and we'll

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:29.319 
they do I take it easy YouTube and we'll
talk<00:05:27.050> to<00:05:27.199> you<00:05:27.289> later
