00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
i'm sure some of these tweaks will work

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:19.450 
i'm sure some of these tweaks will work
for<00:00:13.349> iOS<00:00:14.040> 5<00:00:14.400> but<00:00:15.150> i'm<00:00:15.299> running<00:00:15.660> iOS<00:00:16.850> 6.1<00:00:18.260> point2

first one I want to share is called

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.950 
first one I want to share is called
Hookes<00:00:22.050> law<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.800> probably<00:00:23.490> get<00:00:23.880> more<00:00:24.240> questions

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
Hookes law I probably get more questions

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.450 
Hookes law I probably get more questions
about<00:00:25.470> this<00:00:25.800> single<00:00:26.460> reason<00:00:27.269> my<00:00:28.070> iphone<00:00:29.070> seems

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
about this single reason my iphone seems

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.850 
about this single reason my iphone seems
to<00:00:29.670> be<00:00:29.849> faster<00:00:30.720> or<00:00:31.230> spring<00:00:32.040> year<00:00:33.500> than<00:00:34.500> any

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
to be faster or spring year than any

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.370 
to be faster or spring year than any
other<00:00:35.010> question<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.790> get<00:00:36.000> on<00:00:36.180> YouTube<00:00:36.420> probably

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
other question I get on YouTube probably

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.580 
other question I get on YouTube probably
and<00:00:37.850> you<00:00:38.850> can<00:00:39.059> see<00:00:39.360> when<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.750> open<00:00:40.050> apps

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
and you can see when you open apps

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.220 
and you can see when you open apps
everything<00:00:41.399> just<00:00:41.640> jumps<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.270> lot<00:00:42.420> faster<00:00:43.079> and

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
everything just jumps a lot faster and

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.830 
everything just jumps a lot faster and
that<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.219> simply<00:00:44.460> coming<00:00:45.090> through<00:00:45.390> Hookes<00:00:45.690> law

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
that is simply coming through Hookes law

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.959 
that is simply coming through Hookes law
and<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.710> got<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:46.890> put<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.190> percent<00:00:47.579> sign<00:00:47.789> in

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
and you got to put the percent sign in

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.639 
and you got to put the percent sign in
front<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.480> or<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.750> will<00:00:49.020> not<00:00:49.200> be<00:00:49.379> able<00:00:49.410> to

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
front of it or you will not be able to

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.529 
front of it or you will not be able to
find<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.399> can<00:00:51.030> change<00:00:51.210> these<00:00:51.480> numbers

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
find it and you can change these numbers

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.900 
find it and you can change these numbers
in<00:00:52.140> here<00:00:52.289> however<00:00:52.680> if<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.219> played<00:00:53.489> around<00:00:53.640> with

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
in here however if I played around with

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.700 
in here however if I played around with
those<00:00:54.149> I<00:00:54.390> would<00:00:54.449> take<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.840> screenshot<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.500> this

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
those I would take a screenshot of this

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.849 
those I would take a screenshot of this
before<00:00:56.300> messing<00:00:57.300> around<00:00:57.449> with<00:00:57.780> those<00:00:57.989> the

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
before messing around with those the

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.319 
before messing around with those the
next<00:00:59.190> one<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.370> want<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.699> share<00:00:59.879> is<00:01:00.059> called

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
next one I want to share is called

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.260 
next one I want to share is called
volume<00:01:00.899> amplifier<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.070> if<00:01:02.760> you've<00:01:02.910> ever<00:01:03.059> been

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
volume amplifier and if you've ever been

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.469 
volume amplifier and if you've ever been
in<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.480> car<00:01:03.840> trying<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.589> answer<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.909> telephone

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
in a car trying to answer the telephone

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.010 
in a car trying to answer the telephone
on<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.960> speakerphone<00:01:08.360> with<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.510> iphone<00:01:09.869> you

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
on a speakerphone with the iphone you

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.719 
on a speakerphone with the iphone you
know<00:01:10.140> it's<00:01:10.320> not<00:01:10.470> very<00:01:10.680> loud<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.490> can

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
know it's not very loud so you can

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.249 
know it's not very loud so you can
increase<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.630> by<00:01:12.689> adding<00:01:13.490> volume<00:01:15.259> amplifier

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
increase that by adding volume amplifier

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.010 
increase that by adding volume amplifier
to<00:01:16.799> your<00:01:17.659> iPhone<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:19.159> what<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.310> does<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:21.150> it

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
to your iPhone and what it does is it

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.609 
to your iPhone and what it does is it
puts<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:23.869> icon<00:01:24.869> on<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.229> screen<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:27.290> you<00:01:28.290> can

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
puts a icon on the screen and you can

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.640 
puts a icon on the screen and you can
then<00:01:29.130> change<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.270> few<00:01:30.540> things<00:01:30.570> around<00:01:31.290> let<00:01:31.560> me

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
then change a few things around let me

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.190 
then change a few things around let me
show<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:31.950> what<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.280> does<00:01:32.460> here<00:01:35.600> right<00:01:36.600> here<00:01:36.990> is

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200
