Farm<00:00:20.070> ideas<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:21.380> I<00:00:22.380> wanted<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.800> share<00:00:22.980> a

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
Farm ideas and I wanted to share a

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.620 
Farm ideas and I wanted to share a
little<00:00:23.220> bit<00:00:23.340> with<00:00:23.460> you<00:00:23.820> guys<00:00:24.000> about<00:00:24.180> runners

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
little bit with you guys about runners

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.220 
little bit with you guys about runners
as<00:00:24.990> well<00:00:26.029> as<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:27.210> could<00:00:27.330> see<00:00:27.570> here<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:28.109> know

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
as well as you could see here you know

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.050 
as well as you could see here you know
we<00:00:28.349> got<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.500> strawberry<00:00:29.099> plant<00:00:29.369> it's<00:00:29.730> doing<00:00:29.970> all

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
we got a strawberry plant it's doing all

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.959 
we got a strawberry plant it's doing all
right<00:00:30.090> I<00:00:30.300> mean<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.660> get<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.779> little<00:00:31.019> bit<00:00:31.170> bugs

00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:31.969 
right I mean you get a little bit bugs

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:33.950 
right I mean you get a little bit bugs
but<00:00:32.969> that's<00:00:33.149> what<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.390> deal<00:00:33.600> with<00:00:33.630> when

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
but that's what you deal with when

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.600 
but that's what you deal with when
you're<00:00:33.989> growing<00:00:34.230> organic<00:00:34.829> it's<00:00:35.399> just

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
you're growing organic it's just

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.650 
you're growing organic it's just
something<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:35.910> kind<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.239> comes<00:00:36.450> with<00:00:36.540> the

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
something that kind of comes with the

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.319 
something that kind of comes with the
territory<00:00:37.160> as<00:00:38.160> long<00:00:38.340> as<00:00:38.460> they're<00:00:38.579> not<00:00:38.610> taking

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
territory as long as they're not taking

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.660 
territory as long as they're not taking
over<00:00:39.600> my<00:00:40.260> tend<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.590> let<00:00:40.739> them<00:00:40.829> kind<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.100> graze<00:00:41.640> a

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
over my tend to let them kind of graze a

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.150 
over my tend to let them kind of graze a
little<00:00:42.030> bit<00:00:42.260> but<00:00:43.260> these<00:00:43.410> are<00:00:43.559> runners<00:00:43.920> right

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
little bit but these are runners right

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.889 
little bit but these are runners right
here<00:00:44.370> okay<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:45.750> these<00:00:46.620> actually<00:00:47.870> take<00:00:48.870> a

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
here okay and so these actually take a

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.770 
here okay and so these actually take a
lot<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.860> lot<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.129> energy<00:00:50.399> from<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.120> actual

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
lot of a lot of energy from the actual

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.970 
lot of a lot of energy from the actual
strawberry<00:00:52.230> plant<00:00:52.850> so<00:00:54.379> generally<00:00:55.379> speaking<00:00:55.710> I

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
strawberry plant so generally speaking I

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.689 
strawberry plant so generally speaking I
usually<00:00:56.340> clip<00:00:56.610> these<00:00:56.820> off<00:00:57.350> and<00:00:58.399> I'm<00:00:59.399> going<00:00:59.609> to

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
usually clip these off and I'm going to

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.150 
usually clip these off and I'm going to
clip<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.090> one<00:01:00.300> off<00:01:00.449> because<00:01:01.079> this<00:01:01.859> plant

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
clip this one off because this plant

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.549 
clip this one off because this plant
needs<00:01:02.309> more<00:01:02.520> energy<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.059> it's<00:01:03.329> not<00:01:03.510> doing<00:01:03.930> too

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
needs more energy and it's not doing too

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.170 
needs more energy and it's not doing too
good<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.979> mean<00:01:05.189> it's<00:01:05.339> still<00:01:05.580> got<00:01:05.700> all<00:01:05.729> these<00:01:06.000> new

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
good I mean it's still got all these new

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.390 
good I mean it's still got all these new
leaves<00:01:06.360> coming<00:01:06.720> in<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:06.960> stuff<00:01:07.140> but<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.590> want

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
leaves coming in and stuff but I want

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.730 
leaves coming in and stuff but I want
more<00:01:08.549> energy<00:01:08.700> going<00:01:09.030> into<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.510> but<00:01:10.140> this<00:01:10.500> one's

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
more energy going into it but this one's

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.410 
more energy going into it but this one's
a<00:01:10.799> little<00:01:10.920> more<00:01:11.040> bushy<00:01:11.400> it's<00:01:11.970> just<00:01:12.210> still

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
a little more bushy it's just still

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.179 
a little more bushy it's just still
small<00:01:12.750> but<00:01:12.990> as<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.650> can<00:01:13.740> see<00:01:13.799> there's<00:01:14.100> a

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
small but as you can see there's a

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.990 
small but as you can see there's a
runner<00:01:14.460> right<00:01:14.549> here<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.270> this<00:01:15.840> one's<00:01:16.110> like

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
runner right here and this one's like

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.910 
runner right here and this one's like
almost<00:01:18.000> completely<00:01:18.570> developed<00:01:19.020> see<00:01:19.770> that

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
almost completely developed see that

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.690 
almost completely developed see that
little<00:01:20.960> root<00:01:21.960> there<00:01:22.369> come<00:01:23.369> on<00:01:23.430> out<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.580> there

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
little root there come on out of there

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.429 
little root there come on out of there
so<00:01:24.299> what<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.420> can<00:01:24.630> do<00:01:24.750> with<00:01:24.900> this<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.409> can

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
so what you can do with this is you can

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.760 
so what you can do with this is you can
actually<00:01:25.740> put<00:01:26.130> this<00:01:26.250> into<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.549> pot<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.650> pin<00:01:28.650> it

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
actually put this into a pot and pin it

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.350 
actually put this into a pot and pin it
down<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.220> wait<00:01:29.549> for<00:01:29.759> like<00:01:29.880> two<00:01:30.030> or<00:01:30.150> three<00:01:30.180> days

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
down and wait for like two or three days

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.020 
down and wait for like two or three days
and<00:01:30.810> then<00:01:31.530> clip<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.310> off<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.790> you'll<00:01:32.880> have

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
and then clip it off and you'll have

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.020 
and then clip it off and you'll have
another<00:01:33.479> brand<00:01:34.020> new<00:01:34.200> plant<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.829> it's<00:01:35.820> not

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
another brand new plant and it's not

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.179 
another brand new plant and it's not
from<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.509> root<00:01:36.689> system<00:01:37.110> it's<00:01:37.259> actually<00:01:37.680> from

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
from the root system it's actually from

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.260 
from the root system it's actually from
the<00:01:38.420> the<00:01:39.420> main<00:01:39.600> plant<00:01:40.610> so<00:01:41.610> that's<00:01:41.820> another<00:01:42.090> way

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
the the main plant so that's another way

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.840 
the the main plant so that's another way
that<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.450> can<00:01:42.630> propagate<00:01:42.869> them<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.619> just<00:01:44.009> let

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
that you can propagate them is just let

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.149 
that you can propagate them is just let
them<00:01:45.000> do<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.270> runners<00:01:45.630> but<00:01:46.500> remember<00:01:46.950> when

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
them do the runners but remember when

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.280 
them do the runners but remember when
you<00:01:47.250> let<00:01:47.430> them<00:01:47.549> do<00:01:47.909> runners<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.600> takes<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:49.049> lot

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
you let them do runners it takes a lot

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.560 
you let them do runners it takes a lot
of<00:01:49.320> energy<00:01:49.829> from<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.790> actual<00:01:51.060> strawberry

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
of energy from the actual strawberry

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.889 
of energy from the actual strawberry
plants<00:01:52.020> so<00:01:52.799> I'm<00:01:53.520> gonna<00:01:53.670> go<00:01:53.909> ahead<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.270> clip

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
plants so I'm gonna go ahead and clip

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.959 
plants so I'm gonna go ahead and clip
this<00:01:55.110> one<00:01:55.170> off<00:01:55.500> I'm<00:01:56.189> gonna<00:01:56.340> let<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:56.579> one<00:01:56.880> to

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
this one off I'm gonna let that one to

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.990 
this one off I'm gonna let that one to
go<00:01:57.090> ahead<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.390> grow<00:01:57.659> I'm<00:01:58.170> gonna<00:01:58.320> put<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.530> pot

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
go ahead and grow I'm gonna put a pot

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.310 
go ahead and grow I'm gonna put a pot
under<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.659> I'll<00:02:00.750> show<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:00.960> how<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.110> do<00:02:01.229> it

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
under it and I'll show you how to do it

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.800 
under it and I'll show you how to do it
right<00:02:01.439> now<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:02.149> look<00:02:03.149> for<00:02:03.270> any<00:02:03.390> more<00:02:03.570> see

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.779 

anymore<00:02:08.140> over<00:02:08.649> here<00:02:08.890> and<00:02:09.220> we<00:02:09.310> got<00:02:09.459> another<00:02:09.640> one

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
anymore over here and we got another one

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.759 
anymore over here and we got another one
right<00:02:09.970> here<00:02:10.330> plants<00:02:11.200> doing<00:02:11.319> pretty<00:02:11.530> good<00:02:11.709> I

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
right here plants doing pretty good I

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:13.770 
right here plants doing pretty good I
might<00:02:11.980> pie<00:02:12.370> I<00:02:12.400> might<00:02:12.730> actually<00:02:13.000> just<00:02:13.390> pop<00:02:13.599> this

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
might pie I might actually just pop this

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.080 
might pie I might actually just pop this
one<00:02:13.989> so<00:02:14.709> they<00:02:15.250> don't<00:02:15.400> root<00:02:15.610> until<00:02:15.879> you<00:02:15.970> get

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
one so they don't root until you get

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.020 
one so they don't root until you get
them<00:02:16.209> on<00:02:16.300> the<00:02:16.420> soil<00:02:16.690> though<00:02:16.930> so<00:02:17.940> let's<00:02:18.940> go

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
them on the soil though so let's go

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.930 
them on the soil though so let's go
ahead<00:02:19.090> and<00:02:19.269> do<00:02:19.330> it<00:02:19.480> okay<00:02:20.349> so<00:02:20.560> I<00:02:20.890> got<00:02:21.099> the<00:02:21.129> pot<00:02:21.519> in

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
ahead and do it okay so I got the pot in

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.750 
ahead and do it okay so I got the pot in
the<00:02:22.239> ground<00:02:22.480> here<00:02:23.190> because<00:02:24.190> it<00:02:24.280> was<00:02:24.370> too<00:02:24.519> tall

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
the ground here because it was too tall

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.500 
the ground here because it was too tall
so<00:02:25.360> now<00:02:25.569> you<00:02:25.629> just<00:02:25.810> basically<00:02:27.209> make<00:02:28.209> sure<00:02:28.239> that

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
so now you just basically make sure that

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.210 
so now you just basically make sure that
that<00:02:28.690> root<00:02:28.959> is<00:02:29.170> pressed<00:02:29.590> down<00:02:29.709> you<00:02:29.950> don't<00:02:30.040> want

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
that root is pressed down you don't want

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.670 
that root is pressed down you don't want
to<00:02:30.280> shove<00:02:30.549> it<00:02:30.700> into<00:02:30.819> the<00:02:30.910> ground<00:02:31.530> because<00:02:32.530> it's

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
to shove it into the ground because it's

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.350 
to shove it into the ground because it's
actually<00:02:32.890> unnecessary<00:02:33.730> so<00:02:33.910> you<00:02:34.000> just<00:02:34.180> take<00:02:34.330> a

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
actually unnecessary so you just take a

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.410 
actually unnecessary so you just take a
little<00:02:34.510> you<00:02:34.840> know<00:02:35.349> stake<00:02:36.040> like<00:02:36.250> this<00:02:36.489> and<00:02:37.330> you

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
little you know stake like this and you

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.020 
little you know stake like this and you
just<00:02:39.569> sorry<00:02:40.569> I'm<00:02:40.750> doing<00:02:40.989> this<00:02:41.170> with<00:02:41.349> one<00:02:41.560> hand

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
just sorry I'm doing this with one hand

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.809 
just sorry I'm doing this with one hand
but<00:02:43.030> you<00:02:43.269> basically<00:02:43.450> stake<00:02:44.049> it<00:02:44.200> down<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:45.700> where

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
but you basically stake it down to where

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.970 
but you basically stake it down to where
it's<00:02:45.880> it's<00:02:46.360> kind<00:02:46.630> of<00:02:46.690> tight<00:02:46.900> but<00:02:47.140> it's<00:02:47.290> not<00:02:47.470> too

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
it's it's kind of tight but it's not too

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.289 
it's it's kind of tight but it's not too
tight<00:02:48.250> you<00:02:48.519> know<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:49.920> then<00:02:50.940> try<00:02:51.940> to<00:02:52.000> make<00:02:52.150> sure

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
tight you know and then try to make sure

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.619 
tight you know and then try to make sure
the<00:02:52.629> root<00:02:53.110> area<00:02:53.349> is<00:02:53.620> in<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:53.950> middle<00:02:54.390> that<00:02:55.390> way

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:55.629 
the root area is in the middle that way

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:58.110 
the root area is in the middle that way
your<00:02:56.459> strawberry<00:02:57.459> plant<00:02:57.700> will<00:02:57.849> be<00:02:57.879> in<00:02:58.030> the

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
your strawberry plant will be in the

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.449 
your strawberry plant will be in the
middle<00:02:58.390> so<00:02:58.920> yeah<00:02:59.920> that's<00:03:00.129> how<00:03:00.220> you<00:03:00.310> would

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
middle so yeah that's how you would

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.089 
middle so yeah that's how you would
propagate<00:03:00.670> them<00:03:01.000> as<00:03:01.120> well<00:03:01.269> so<00:03:01.799> and<00:03:02.799> then<00:03:02.950> once

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:04.770 
propagate them as well so and then once
that<00:03:03.220> roots<00:03:03.579> like<00:03:03.879> I<00:03:04.000> said<00:03:04.209> you<00:03:04.299> just<00:03:04.329> clip

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780
