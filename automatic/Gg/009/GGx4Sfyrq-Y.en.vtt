but now though isn't left forward so he

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.510 
but now though isn't left forward so he
plays<00:00:30.539> like<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.779> striker<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.560> messy<00:00:32.309> isn't

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
the very quick players but in my opinion

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.069 
the very quick players but in my opinion
I<00:01:42.000> think<00:01:42.030> right<00:01:42.360> now<00:01:42.479> there's<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.780> little<00:01:42.899> bit

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
I think right now there's a little bit

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.319 
I think right now there's a little bit
quicker<00:01:43.380> Messi's<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.610> drilling<00:01:45.000> type<00:01:45.180> of

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
quicker Messi's that drilling type of

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.760 
quicker Messi's that drilling type of
player<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.869> little<00:01:46.079> bit<00:01:46.170> slow<00:01:46.439> in<00:01:46.470> my

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
player so is a little bit slow in my

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.830 
player so is a little bit slow in my
opinion<00:01:47.130> than<00:01:47.399> ronaldo<00:01:47.670> but<00:01:48.450> now<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.750> this

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
opinion than ronaldo but now that this

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.230 
opinion than ronaldo but now that this
bombs<00:01:49.350> down<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.770> wing

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
bombs down the wing

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.819 
bombs down the wing
you<00:01:50.390> know<00:01:50.509> you<00:01:50.570> could<00:01:50.810> be<00:01:50.930> many<00:01:51.110> things<00:01:51.200> so

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
you know you could be many things so

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:53.109 
you know you could be many things so
let's<00:01:52.040> talk<00:01:52.130> about<00:01:52.189> the<00:01:52.460> long<00:01:52.640> shots<00:01:52.880> now

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
let's talk about the long shots now

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.389 
let's talk about the long shots now
right<00:01:53.869> now<00:01:54.020> those<00:01:54.259> long<00:01:54.500> shots<00:01:54.799> are<00:01:55.040> just

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
right now those long shots are just

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.149 
right now those long shots are just
insane<00:01:55.790> Messi's<00:01:56.630> long<00:01:56.840> shots<00:01:57.140> are<00:01:57.350> decent<00:01:58.009> but

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
insane Messi's long shots are decent but

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.249 
insane Messi's long shots are decent but
I<00:01:58.490> think<00:01:58.700> Ronaldo's<00:01:59.210> long<00:01:59.420> shots<00:01:59.689> are<00:01:59.899> way

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
I think Ronaldo's long shots are way

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.070 
I think Ronaldo's long shots are way
better<00:02:00.500> than<00:02:00.619> Macy's<00:02:01.610> by<00:02:01.850> far<00:02:02.270> he's<00:02:02.780> caused<00:02:03.049> a

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
better than Macy's by far he's caused a

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.710 
better than Macy's by far he's caused a
lot<00:02:03.380> of<00:02:03.409> goals<00:02:03.710> with<00:02:04.369> that<00:02:05.299> insane

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
lot of goals with that insane

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.199 
lot of goals with that insane
shot<00:02:06.079> power<00:02:06.289> and<00:02:06.619> those<00:02:07.039> black<00:02:07.340> 90-plus<00:02:07.970> long

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
shot power and those black 90-plus long

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.089 
shot power and those black 90-plus long
shot<00:02:08.479> he<00:02:08.720> can<00:02:08.899> score<00:02:09.170> long<00:02:09.380> shots<00:02:09.679> from<00:02:09.830> pretty

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
shot he can score long shots from pretty

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.370 
shot he can score long shots from pretty
much<00:02:10.220> everywhere<00:02:10.759> Macy's<00:02:11.690> long<00:02:11.900> shots<00:02:12.170> it's

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
much everywhere Macy's long shots it's

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.900 
much everywhere Macy's long shots it's

player he is so mrs. long shots is not

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.940 
player he is so mrs. long shots is not
that<00:02:20.569> great<00:02:20.780> and<00:02:21.050> the<00:02:21.140> shop<00:02:21.380> I<00:02:21.530> was<00:02:21.650> not<00:02:21.830> that

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
that great and the shop I was not that

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.009 
that great and the shop I was not that
great<00:02:22.160> also<00:02:22.640> so<00:02:23.360> let's<00:02:23.569> talk<00:02:23.690> about<00:02:23.750> the

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
great also so let's talk about the

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:25.870 
great also so let's talk about the
finishing<00:02:24.530> now<00:02:24.680> finishing<00:02:25.130> I<00:02:25.400> think<00:02:25.580> Messi

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
finishing now finishing I think Messi

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.900 
finishing now finishing I think Messi
has<00:02:25.910> bare<00:02:26.209> finishing<00:02:26.780> because<00:02:27.620> he<00:02:27.860> is<00:02:28.130> almost

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
has bare finishing because he is almost

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.240 
has bare finishing because he is almost
in<00:02:29.209> a<00:02:29.299> central<00:02:29.750> position<00:02:29.930> so<00:02:30.860> it's<00:02:31.010> always

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
in a central position so it's always

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.039 
in a central position so it's always
ready<00:02:31.610> to<00:02:31.670> finish<00:02:32.000> up<00:02:32.299> the<00:02:32.480> goals<00:02:32.690> and

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
ready to finish up the goals and

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:35.259 
ready to finish up the goals and
Ronaldo's<00:02:34.010> that<00:02:34.220> cutting<00:02:34.610> type<00:02:34.850> of<00:02:35.000> a<00:02:35.060> play

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
Ronaldo's that cutting type of a play

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.660 
Ronaldo's that cutting type of a play
that<00:02:35.420> smashes<00:02:36.019> the<00:02:36.319> ball<00:02:36.530> into<00:02:36.799> the<00:02:36.920> net<00:02:37.130> let's

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
that smashes the ball into the net let's

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.430 
that smashes the ball into the net let's
talk<00:02:37.819> about<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.150> positioning<00:02:38.750> now<00:02:38.900> Macy's

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
talk about the positioning now Macy's

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.500 
talk about the positioning now Macy's
positioning<00:02:40.010> is<00:02:40.220> not<00:02:40.519> that<00:02:40.670> great<00:02:40.910> after<00:02:41.390> be

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
positioning is not that great after be

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.120 
positioning is not that great after be
honest<00:02:41.840> his<00:02:41.959> positioning<00:02:42.500> wasn't<00:02:42.830> that<00:02:42.920> great

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
honest his positioning wasn't that great

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.250 
honest his positioning wasn't that great
i<00:02:43.190> had<00:02:43.400> to<00:02:43.489> work<00:02:43.760> a<00:02:43.940> lot<00:02:44.150> with<00:02:44.180> him<00:02:44.480> to<00:02:44.989> get<00:02:45.200> him

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
i had to work a lot with him to get him

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.190 
i had to work a lot with him to get him
forward<00:02:46.220> and<00:02:46.459> ronaldo<00:02:47.209> he<00:02:47.390> was<00:02:47.510> old<00:02:47.660> always

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
forward and ronaldo he was old always

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.660 
forward and ronaldo he was old always
there<00:02:48.410> i<00:02:48.440> think<00:02:48.709> it's<00:02:48.830> because<00:02:48.980> his<00:02:49.250> high<00:02:49.459> low

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
there i think it's because his high low

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.940 
there i think it's because his high low
work<00:02:49.910> rates<00:02:50.209> help<00:02:50.450> him<00:02:50.599> out<00:02:50.660> a<00:02:50.720> lot<00:02:50.989> and<00:02:51.170> messy

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
work rates help him out a lot and messy

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.830 
work rates help him out a lot and messy
like<00:02:52.489> he's<00:02:52.700> got<00:02:52.849> medium<00:02:53.000> no<00:02:53.269> work<00:02:53.480> for<00:02:53.510> it<00:02:53.690> so

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
like he's got medium no work for it so

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.120 
like he's got medium no work for it so
that's<00:02:54.049> not<00:02:54.170> really<00:02:54.320> good<00:02:54.620> so<00:02:54.650> you<00:02:54.859> need<00:02:55.040> to

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
that's not really good so you need to

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.490 
that's not really good so you need to
work<00:02:55.370> a<00:02:55.640> lot<00:02:56.030> harder<00:02:56.060> with<00:02:56.510> Messi<00:02:56.930> to<00:02:57.079> do<00:02:57.230> great

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
work a lot harder with Messi to do great

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.050 
work a lot harder with Messi to do great
things<00:02:57.739> and<00:02:58.310> right<00:02:58.430> now<00:02:58.549> though<00:02:58.730> he's<00:02:58.880> just

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
things and right now though he's just

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.270 
things and right now though he's just
always<00:02:59.269> there<00:02:59.420> so<00:02:59.930> that's<00:03:00.530> a<00:03:00.709> positioning<00:03:01.250> for

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
always there so that's a positioning for

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.920 
always there so that's a positioning for
you<00:03:01.609> right<00:03:01.820> there<00:03:02.060> moving<00:03:02.660> on<00:03:02.780> to<00:03:02.810> the

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
you right there moving on to the

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.620 
you right there moving on to the
dribbling<00:03:03.500> I<00:03:03.739> think<00:03:04.400> Macy's<00:03:05.060> dribbling<00:03:05.450> is<00:03:05.600> a

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
dribbling I think Macy's dribbling is a

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.539 
dribbling I think Macy's dribbling is a
lot<00:03:06.019> better<00:03:06.230> than<00:03:06.380> Ronaldo's<00:03:06.920> I<00:03:07.130> mean<00:03:07.280> messy

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
lot better than Ronaldo's I mean messy

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.910 
lot better than Ronaldo's I mean messy
can<00:03:07.820> dribble<00:03:08.030> past<00:03:08.359> anyone<00:03:08.780> is<00:03:09.019> the<00:03:09.709> ball

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
can dribble past anyone is the ball

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.490 
can dribble past anyone is the ball
always<00:03:10.190> stays<00:03:10.579> near<00:03:10.940> his<00:03:11.120> feet<00:03:11.420> so<00:03:11.750> like<00:03:12.079> you

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
always stays near his feet so like you

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
type of player so I don't think that

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.810 
type of player so I don't think that
messy<00:04:36.350> should<00:04:36.800> be<00:04:36.860> scoring<00:04:37.280> loads<00:04:37.580> and<00:04:37.760> loads

messy should be scoring loads and loads
of<00:04:38.060> goals<00:04:38.270> I<00:04:38.450> think<00:04:38.660> that's<00:04:38.840> for<00:04:38.960> now<00:04:39.110> those

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
of goals I think that's for now those

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.350 
of goals I think that's for now those
job<00:04:39.590> I<00:04:39.680> mean<00:04:39.830> I<00:04:39.860> use<00:04:40.370> them<00:04:40.550> both<00:04:40.730> in<00:04:40.970> the<00:04:41.000> squad

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
job I mean I use them both in the squad

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.330 
job I mean I use them both in the squad
and<00:04:41.600> I<00:04:41.930> use<00:04:42.110> them<00:04:42.290> equally<00:04:42.710> as<00:04:42.830> well<00:04:43.040> so<00:04:43.220> that's

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
and I use them equally as well so that's

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.480 
and I use them equally as well so that's
pretty<00:04:43.670> fair<00:04:43.940> so<00:04:44.630> Ronaldo<00:04:45.200> wins<00:04:45.890> on<00:04:46.130> the<00:04:46.160> goals

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
pretty fair so Ronaldo wins on the goals

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.340 
pretty fair so Ronaldo wins on the goals
okay<00:04:47.180> so<00:04:47.240> let's<00:04:47.570> talk<00:04:47.630> about<00:04:47.870> the<00:04:48.110> better

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350

player<00:04:48.650> who's<00:04:48.920> the<00:04:49.100> better<00:04:49.250> player<00:04:49.550> in<00:04:49.760> this

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
player who's the better player in this

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.470 
player who's the better player in this
game<00:04:50.169> Ronaldo<00:04:51.169> or<00:04:51.350> messy<00:04:51.740> in<00:04:51.890> my<00:04:52.010> opinion

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
game Ronaldo or messy in my opinion

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.730 
game Ronaldo or messy in my opinion
Ronaldo<00:04:53.480> is<00:04:53.510> a<00:04:53.690> lot<00:04:53.930> better<00:04:54.110> than<00:04:54.320> messi<00:04:54.530> I

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
Ronaldo is a lot better than messi I

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.250 
Ronaldo is a lot better than messi I
mean<00:04:55.040> Ronaldo's<00:04:55.640> the<00:04:56.330> overall<00:04:56.780> type<00:04:56.990> player

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
mean Ronaldo's the overall type player

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.080 
mean Ronaldo's the overall type player
he's<00:04:57.440> got<00:04:57.620> everything<00:04:58.010> he<00:04:58.220> doesn't<00:04:59.000> have

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
he's got everything he doesn't have

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.790 
he's got everything he doesn't have
anything<00:04:59.419> day<00:04:59.750> doesn't<00:05:00.200> need<00:05:00.350> he's<00:05:00.590> got

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
anything day doesn't need he's got

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.130 
anything day doesn't need he's got
everything<00:05:01.250> he's<00:05:01.580> got<00:05:01.730> the<00:05:01.880> whole<00:05:02.060> package<00:05:02.300> to

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
everything he's got the whole package to

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.710 
everything he's got the whole package to
be<00:05:03.740> the<00:05:03.919> bear<00:05:04.070> player<00:05:04.400> messi<00:05:04.760> there's<00:05:05.450> a<00:05:05.540> few

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
be the bear player messi there's a few

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.270 
be the bear player messi there's a few
things<00:05:05.870> which<00:05:06.080> I<00:05:06.200> don't<00:05:06.260> like<00:05:06.620> three<00:05:07.010> star

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
things which I don't like three star

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.820 
things which I don't like three star
weak<00:05:07.490> foot<00:05:07.730> for<00:05:07.940> example<00:05:08.480> is<00:05:08.870> positioning<00:05:09.590> not

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
weak foot for example is positioning not

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.220 
weak foot for example is positioning not
that<00:05:10.040> great<00:05:10.340> because<00:05:10.730> of<00:05:10.820> the<00:05:10.970> work<00:05:11.180> rates<00:05:11.510> but

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
that great because of the work rates but

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.050 
that great because of the work rates but
yeah<00:05:12.530> I<00:05:12.740> think<00:05:12.830> the<00:05:13.250> better<00:05:13.400> player<00:05:13.700> overall

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
yeah I think the better player overall

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.120 
yeah I think the better player overall
is<00:05:14.270> Ronaldo<00:05:14.840> I<00:05:14.870> mean<00:05:15.140> he<00:05:15.320> has<00:05:15.440> everything<00:05:15.740> and

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
is Ronaldo I mean he has everything and

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.730 
is Ronaldo I mean he has everything and
he<00:05:17.030> just<00:05:17.060> dominates<00:05:17.750> messy<00:05:18.200> on<00:05:18.350> this<00:05:18.530> game

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
he just dominates messy on this game

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.430 
he just dominates messy on this game
