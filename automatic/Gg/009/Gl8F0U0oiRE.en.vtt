00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
hello and welcome to the carb I'm Lauren

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.120 
hello and welcome to the carb I'm Lauren
and<00:00:03.959> today<00:00:04.110> we're<00:00:04.410> gonna<00:00:04.500> get<00:00:04.680> some<00:00:04.890> armor

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
and today we're gonna get some armor

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.249 
and today we're gonna get some armor
stones<00:00:05.520> which<00:00:05.879> are<00:00:06.089> kind<00:00:06.600> of<00:00:06.629> difficult<00:00:06.839> to

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
stones which are kind of difficult to

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.129 
stones which are kind of difficult to
get<00:00:07.440> because<00:00:07.710> not<00:00:08.010> many<00:00:08.929> missions

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
get because not many missions

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.009 
get because not many missions
I<00:00:10.349> think<00:00:10.590> give<00:00:10.800> them<00:00:10.980> away<00:00:11.130> so<00:00:11.750> the<00:00:12.750> easiest

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
I think give them away so the easiest

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.410 
I think give them away so the easiest
one<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.469> get<00:00:13.679> is<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.280> low<00:00:14.610> two-star<00:00:15.120> port

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
one to get is the low two-star port

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.870 
one to get is the low two-star port
missions<00:00:15.890> against<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:17.039> die<00:00:17.190> of<00:00:17.310> loss<00:00:17.520> in<00:00:17.789> the

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
missions against a die of loss in the

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.599 
missions against a die of loss in the
mission<00:00:18.180> for<00:00:18.359> deform<00:00:18.720> wyvern<00:00:19.340> this<00:00:20.340> is<00:00:20.460> at

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
mission for deform wyvern this is at

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.849 
mission for deform wyvern this is at
nighttime<00:00:20.880> in<00:00:21.600> sandy<00:00:22.140> plains<00:00:22.380> so<00:00:22.619> you<00:00:22.680> might

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
nighttime in sandy plains so you might

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.890 
nighttime in sandy plains so you might
want<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.100> bring<00:00:23.250> some<00:00:23.310> hot<00:00:23.670> drinks<00:00:24.119> depending

on how quick can you do this now

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.839 
on how quick can you do this now
depending<00:00:27.960> on<00:00:28.050> your<00:00:28.109> level<00:00:28.550> you<00:00:29.550> should<00:00:29.670> be

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
depending on your level you should be

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.290 
depending on your level you should be
able<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.029> slow<00:00:30.300> this<00:00:30.599> in<00:00:30.900> under<00:00:31.080> five<00:00:31.380> minutes

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
able to slow this in under five minutes

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.569 
able to slow this in under five minutes
on<00:00:33.300> your<00:00:33.510> own<00:00:33.719> or<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.800> can<00:00:35.010> if<00:00:35.190> you're<00:00:35.340> doing<00:00:35.460> a

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
on your own or you can if you're doing a

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:36.979 
on your own or you can if you're doing a
group<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:36.000> can<00:00:36.059> do<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.300> very<00:00:36.420> quickly

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
group you can do it very quickly

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.450 
group you can do it very quickly
I<00:00:37.110> think<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.380> fastest<00:00:37.770> time<00:00:37.950> I've<00:00:38.100> done<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.370> is

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
I think the fastest time I've done it is

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.319 
I think the fastest time I've done it is
two<00:00:38.670> minutes<00:00:38.969> with<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.149> group<00:00:40.489> so<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.910> tried<00:00:42.210> to

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
two minutes with a group so I tried to

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.209 
two minutes with a group so I tried to
get<00:00:42.450> one<00:00:42.570> earlier<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.590> was<00:00:43.770> having<00:00:44.070> no<00:00:44.190> luck

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.180 
get one earlier and I was having no luck
solo<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.180> we<00:00:45.899> got<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.620> bunch<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:46.950> friends

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
solo so we got a bunch of friends

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.680 
solo so we got a bunch of friends
together<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.850> we<00:00:47.969> decided<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.420> do<00:00:48.480> together

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
together and we decided to do together

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.290 
together and we decided to do together
sorry<00:00:49.110> it's<00:00:49.320> all<00:00:49.500> sped<00:00:50.190> up<00:00:50.340> but<00:00:50.670> it's<00:00:50.969> kind<00:00:51.239> of

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
sorry it's all sped up but it's kind of

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.540 
sorry it's all sped up but it's kind of
boring<00:00:51.539> watching<00:00:51.989> four<00:00:52.890> people<00:00:53.160> go<00:00:53.250> against<00:00:53.460> a

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
boring watching four people go against a

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.020 
boring watching four people go against a
really<00:00:53.730> easy<00:00:53.910> monster<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:54.660> oh<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.820> was<00:00:56.820> doing

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
really easy monster so oh I was doing

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.080 
really easy monster so oh I was doing
there<00:00:57.239> um<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:58.500> basically<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:59.430> fight<00:00:59.789> him<00:00:59.940> as

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
there um so basically you fight him as

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.610 
there um so basically you fight him as
normal<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.719> don't<00:01:00.780> need<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.199> capture<00:01:01.440> him

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
normal you don't need to capture him

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.640 
normal you don't need to capture him
because<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.129> doesn't<00:01:02.340> affect<00:01:02.960> from<00:01:03.960> what<00:01:04.559> I've

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
because it doesn't affect from what I've

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.460 
because it doesn't affect from what I've
experienced<00:01:05.189> effect<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.670> drop<00:01:05.880> rate

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
experienced effect the drop rate

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.990 
experienced effect the drop rate
unfortunately<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.560> drop<00:01:07.770> rates<00:01:07.979> only<00:01:08.159> 10%<00:01:08.490> so

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
unfortunately the drop rates only 10% so

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.480 
unfortunately the drop rates only 10% so
I<00:01:09.030> really<00:01:09.360> recommend<00:01:09.510> having<00:01:10.229> anything<00:01:11.159> that

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
I really recommend having anything that

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.480 
I really recommend having anything that
adds<00:01:11.640> good<00:01:12.000> luck<00:01:13.189> basically<00:01:14.189> any<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.400> these

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
adds good luck basically any of these

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.910 
adds good luck basically any of these
thing<00:01:14.909> was<00:01:15.060> phaeton<00:01:15.689> so<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.320> gold<00:01:16.500> Ratheon

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
thing was phaeton so the gold Ratheon

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.850 
thing was phaeton so the gold Ratheon
armor<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.610> best<00:01:18.049> but<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.170> can<00:01:19.320> also<00:01:19.470> use

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
armor is the best but you can also use

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.710 
armor is the best but you can also use
some<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.369> arena<00:01:20.700> armors<00:01:21.240> as<00:01:21.390> well<00:01:21.540> that

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
some of the arena armors as well that

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:58.789 
some of the arena armors as well that
add<00:01:21.810> good<00:01:22.080> luck<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:23.000> gem<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.119> up

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.429 

and<00:01:59.789> it's<00:02:00.030> pretty<00:02:00.329> much<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.570> simple<00:02:01.049> and

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
and it's pretty much that simple and

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.560 
and it's pretty much that simple and
quick<00:02:01.820> again<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:02.939> really<00:02:03.030> depends<00:02:03.420> on<00:02:03.509> the

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
quick again it really depends on the

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.240 
quick again it really depends on the
team<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:03.990> have<00:02:04.289> if<00:02:04.530> you're<00:02:04.679> a<00:02:04.710> quite<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.039> low

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
of like a 20 minute battle but it really

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.830 
of like a 20 minute battle but it really
depends<00:02:12.870> on<00:02:12.959> how<00:02:13.140> good<00:02:13.379> you<00:02:13.530> are<00:02:13.940> if<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:15.569> are

also some flash grenades as well because
they<00:02:22.799> really<00:02:23.040> help<00:02:23.220> so<00:02:23.910> armor<00:02:24.299> stones

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
they really help so armor stones

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.839 
they really help so armor stones
typically<00:02:25.110> come<00:02:25.349> in<00:02:25.379> pairs<00:02:25.709> of<00:02:25.799> two<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.400> I've

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
typically come in pairs of two and I've

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.920 
typically come in pairs of two and I've
never<00:02:27.120> had<00:02:27.510> more<00:02:27.989> than<00:02:28.200> 2<00:02:28.470> or<00:02:28.860> less<00:02:29.280> than<00:02:29.310> two

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
never had more than 2 or less than two

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.800 
never had more than 2 or less than two
and<00:02:30.930> I<00:02:31.019> tend<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.590> get<00:02:31.709> them<00:02:31.950> with<00:02:32.280> migrate

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
and I tend to get them with migrate

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.680 
and I tend to get them with migrate
migrate<00:02:33.810> lot<00:02:34.260> send<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.280> get<00:02:35.430> them<00:02:35.670> every<00:02:36.510> two

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
migrate lot send to get them every two

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.390 
migrate lot send to get them every two
to<00:02:36.810> three<00:02:36.840> rounds<00:02:37.170> so<00:02:37.560> don't<00:02:37.769> be<00:02:37.860> disheartened

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400

if you haven't got any for a couple of

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.380 
if you haven't got any for a couple of
rounds<00:02:40.200> they<00:02:40.349> will<00:02:40.500> come<00:02:40.709> so<00:02:41.400> mainly<00:02:41.910> using

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
rounds they will come so mainly using

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.770 
rounds they will come so mainly using
armor<00:02:42.630> stones<00:02:42.870> to<00:02:43.260> make<00:02:43.290> armor<00:02:43.709> spears<00:02:44.190> and<00:02:44.780> if

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
you make true armor spheres because

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.449 
you make true armor spheres because
they're<00:02:51.989> quite<00:02:52.170> difficult<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:52.620> get<00:02:52.829> even<00:02:53.160> in

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
they're quite difficult to get even in

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.220
