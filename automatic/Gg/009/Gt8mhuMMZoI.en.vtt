00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:19.920
 less than lots and a lot fried 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:23.550
 simply fill and fry 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.850
 and let the first steps we will 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.500
 proceed now to the point and the 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.660
 explanation that I told you that takes you 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.960
 I was going to give them 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.290
 look they come very close and your 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.360
 sometimes he gets confused and thinks he has 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.060
 a single point in your hand and you have two that 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.910
 they are stuck 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.770
 with the point while working we should not 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.600
 have covered 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.160
 we owe everything in the covered and 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.230
 protected from the air 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.400
 of the ambient temperature because in 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.400
 followed the northeast 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.390
 with everything you can make butterflies 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.850
 in the Chinese markets there are different 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.129
 sizes 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.479
 and there are also circulars that 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.830
 there are also rice rice 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.500
 logically for frying are these of 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.970
 corn flour these corn flour 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.970

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:26.060
 delicious this delicious mixture inside 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:29.690
 from the heap observe that it must be 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.380
 a tiny dose 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:35.590
 and tight 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:39.600
 so what do we do we dip our finger in 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:43.640
 the water with the cornstarch 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.640
 to stick the edges 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.869
 serve you 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.869
 we went over the edge 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.400
 to seal 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:02.110
 to seal the package 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:05.110
 we are appealing we get to the little bank 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.110
 we stick 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:12.170
 we stick we do the same in this other 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.170
 little corner and so 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:19.740
 the pile is going to stay 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:23.370
