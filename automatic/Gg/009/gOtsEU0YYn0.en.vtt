the olympus XA this little camera is so
often<00:00:24.810> prepared<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.830> in<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.010> same

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
often prepared to and in the same

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
work perfect control the distance your

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.070 
work perfect control the distance your
subject<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:20.939> away<00:01:21.119> from<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.780> will<00:01:21.930> use

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
subject is away from you you will use

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.810 
subject is away from you you will use
this<00:01:22.409> little<00:01:22.799> lever<00:01:23.189> down<00:01:23.280> here<00:01:23.640> at<00:01:23.729> the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
this little lever down here at the

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.499 
this little lever down here at the
bottom<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.270> it'll<00:01:25.110> turn<00:01:25.939> and<00:01:26.939> when<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.270> turn

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
bottom and it'll turn and when you turn

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.249 
bottom and it'll turn and when you turn
that<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.990> actually<00:01:28.170> adjusts<00:01:29.040> up<00:01:29.159> here<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:30.900> it's

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
that it actually adjusts up here so it's

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:31.999 
that it actually adjusts up here so it's
pretty<00:01:31.439> fun

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
pretty fun

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.310 
pretty fun
this<00:01:32.340> entire<00:01:32.610> camera<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.150> just<00:01:33.630> pure<00:01:33.960> fun<00:01:34.200> to

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
this entire camera is just pure fun to

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.749 
this entire camera is just pure fun to
use<00:01:34.500> that's<00:01:34.740> pretty<00:01:35.070> simple<00:01:35.310> because<00:01:35.460> this

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
use that's pretty simple because this

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.460 
use that's pretty simple because this
one's<00:01:35.939> an<00:01:36.060> feet<00:01:36.420> whereas<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.079> lot<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.350> the

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
one's an feet whereas a lot of the

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.899 
one's an feet whereas a lot of the
Russian<00:01:37.799> cameras<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.280> have<00:01:38.430> are<00:01:38.670> in

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
Russian cameras that I have are in

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.240 
Russian cameras that I have are in
meters<00:01:39.180> this<00:01:40.110> one's<00:01:40.320> in<00:01:40.409> feet<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:40.680> I'm<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:41.070> whole

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
meters this one's in feet so I'm a whole

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.010 
meters this one's in feet so I'm a whole
lot<00:01:41.430> more<00:01:41.670> in<00:01:41.820> tune<00:01:42.090> with<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.479> distance<00:01:42.869> on

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
lot more in tune with the distance on

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.859 
lot more in tune with the distance on
this<00:01:43.110> camera<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:44.009> can<00:01:44.159> adjust<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.700> ISO<00:01:44.939> or<00:01:45.810> a

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
this camera you can adjust the ISO or a

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.649 
this camera you can adjust the ISO or a
si<00:01:46.350> by<00:01:46.619> moving<00:01:46.950> this<00:01:47.189> little<00:01:47.850> notch<00:01:48.630> right

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
si by moving this little notch right

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.749 
si by moving this little notch right
there<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.350> whatever<00:01:49.649> is<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.280> speed<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.640> need

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
there to whatever is the speed you need

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.730 
there to whatever is the speed you need
it's<00:01:51.119> pretty<00:01:51.299> great<00:01:51.570> at<00:01:51.810> taking<00:01:52.200> care<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.590> the

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
it's pretty great at taking care of the

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.230 
it's pretty great at taking care of the
rest<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.100> work<00:01:53.220> for<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.700> that's

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
rest of the work for you that's

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.969 
rest of the work for you that's
