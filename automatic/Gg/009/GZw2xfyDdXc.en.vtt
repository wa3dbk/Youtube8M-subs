00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
what we'll do is make the honey lime and

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.520 
what we'll do is make the honey lime and
cilantro<00:01:07.460> butter<00:01:07.940> starting<00:01:08.780> off<00:01:08.899> with<00:01:09.200> the

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.410 

then<00:01:15.470> we<00:01:15.649> have<00:01:15.830> the<00:01:16.009> honey<00:01:16.190> and<00:01:16.399> to<00:01:17.090> loosen

then we have the honey and to loosen

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.760 
then we have the honey and to loosen
that<00:01:17.479> honey<00:01:17.750> a<00:01:17.840> little<00:01:18.020> bit<00:01:18.289> we're<00:01:18.590> going<00:01:18.709> to

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
that honey a little bit we're going to

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.350 
that honey a little bit we're going to
add<00:01:18.890> the<00:01:19.039> lime<00:01:19.399> juice<00:01:19.610> to<00:01:19.789> that<00:01:19.940> so<00:01:20.179> it's

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
add the lime juice to that so it's

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.690 
add the lime juice to that so it's
easier<00:01:20.720> to<00:01:20.810> remove<00:01:21.200> from<00:01:21.530> the<00:01:22.149> the<00:01:23.149> ramekin

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
easier to remove from the the ramekin

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.440 
easier to remove from the the ramekin
add<00:01:25.700> that<00:01:26.030> to<00:01:26.209> the<00:01:26.300> softened<00:01:26.690> butter<00:01:28.450> next

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
add that to the softened butter next

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.790 
add that to the softened butter next
we'll<00:01:29.599> add<00:01:29.630> chopped<00:01:30.110> cilantro<00:01:30.289> fresh

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800

cilantro<00:01:32.500> stir<00:01:33.500> that<00:01:33.740> up<00:01:33.770> sometimes<00:01:34.580> it<00:01:34.729> takes

00:01:34.839 --> 00:01:34.849 
cilantro stir that up sometimes it takes

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:37.150 
cilantro stir that up sometimes it takes
a<00:01:35.030> little<00:01:35.179> bit<00:01:35.390> too<00:01:35.660> to<00:01:36.259> get<00:01:36.440> it<00:01:36.560> emulsified

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
a little bit too to get it emulsified

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.160 
a little bit too to get it emulsified
but<00:01:37.640> it'll<00:01:38.179> go<00:01:38.360> eventually<00:01:40.569> so<00:01:41.569> after<00:01:42.140> about

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
but it'll go eventually so after about

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.680 
but it'll go eventually so after about
15<00:01:43.130> minutes<00:01:43.160> or<00:01:43.550> so<00:01:43.580> the<00:01:44.030> corn<00:01:44.330> is<00:01:44.450> nicely

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
15 minutes or so the corn is nicely

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.190

grilled and what we do at this point is

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.770 
grilled and what we do at this point is
we<00:01:48.200> pull<00:01:48.530> back<00:01:48.560> the<00:01:49.280> husks<00:01:49.729> as<00:01:49.910> you<00:01:50.360> can<00:01:50.539> see
