 a lot of quality in the lock 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.360
 always the possibility that if you 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.600
 lose a key has we can ask 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.210
 to the manufacturer a copy 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.700

 closing pistons 6 mm 7 mm 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:23.700
 as we can see in this case 14 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.070
 millimeters in order that within what 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.050
 is a range of anti-theft 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.330
 you can find what you want in addition 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.400
 we have to go integration this by 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.930
 example a support all a support for 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.780
 a clip on many bikes we 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.030
 we found the hole to leave the clamp 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.470
 and in many others we have the gap but 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.170
 we do not want the padlock to be giving 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.150
 blows not circulating then the 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.009
 supports are usually tuned to a 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.190
 part of the bike where it is not going to 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.440
 clog and also go covered in rubber 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.310

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.820

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.950
 for example it does very well 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.120
 supports of the integration kit or 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.830
 support for theft 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.020
