00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
and get to my point the point that i

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.030 
and get to my point the point that i
wanted<00:04:01.079> to<00:04:01.139> make<00:04:01.319> is<00:04:01.469> that<00:04:01.499> I<00:04:01.650> think<00:04:01.980> they

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
wanted to make is that I think they

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.470 
wanted to make is that I think they
should<00:04:02.219> do<00:04:02.280> this<00:04:02.459> every<00:04:02.700> month<00:04:02.849> they<00:04:03.299> should

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
should do this every month they should

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.179 
should do this every month they should
handle<00:04:03.719> this<00:04:03.840> like<00:04:03.989> little<00:04:04.260> buster<00:04:04.530> ZX<00:04:04.889> and

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:05.189 
handle this like little buster ZX and

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:06.979 
handle this like little buster ZX and
they<00:04:05.700> should<00:04:05.879> just<00:04:06.030> go<00:04:06.150> over<00:04:06.389> all<00:04:06.569> the<00:04:06.719> members

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
they should just go over all the members

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:08.330 
they should just go over all the members
of<00:04:07.019> the<00:04:07.200> generation<00:04:07.650> of<00:04:07.709> miracles<00:04:07.950> because

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
of the generation of miracles because

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.589 
of the generation of miracles because
this<00:04:09.090> was<00:04:09.359> pasted<00:04:09.810> right<00:04:10.439> it<00:04:10.859> was<00:04:11.189> not<00:04:11.599> rushed

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
this was pasted right it was not rushed

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.690 
this was pasted right it was not rushed
there<00:04:13.290> yes<00:04:13.859> they<00:04:14.040> could<00:04:14.099> have<00:04:14.280> showed<00:04:14.459> more

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
there yes they could have showed more

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.819 
there yes they could have showed more
matches<00:04:15.269> but<00:04:15.540> they<00:04:15.749> kind<00:04:16.049> of<00:04:16.169> they<00:04:16.410> really<00:04:16.440> got

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
matches but they kind of they really got

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.249 
matches but they kind of they really got
their<00:04:17.009> point<00:04:17.250> across<00:04:17.340> with<00:04:18.199> illuminating<00:04:19.199> the

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:19.259 
their point across with illuminating the
