this<00:02:53.989> because<00:02:54.230> what<00:02:54.530> it<00:02:54.650> does<00:02:54.680> is<00:02:54.980> it<00:02:55.040> adds

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
this because what it does is it adds

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.390 
this because what it does is it adds
moisture<00:02:56.329> to<00:02:56.690> the<00:02:56.720> hair<00:02:56.959> without<00:02:57.560> giving<00:02:58.220> it

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
moisture to the hair without giving it

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.520 
moisture to the hair without giving it
that<00:02:58.700> hard<00:02:59.000> texture<00:02:59.599> that<00:02:59.690> a<00:02:59.750> lot<00:02:59.900> of<00:02:59.989> mooses

that hard texture that a lot of mooses
have<00:03:00.799> and<00:03:01.579> I<00:03:01.640> think<00:03:01.670> it's<00:03:01.940> really<00:03:02.090> important

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:02.629 
have and I think it's really important

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:04.720 
have and I think it's really important
to<00:03:02.690> make<00:03:02.930> sure<00:03:02.959> that<00:03:03.260> curly<00:03:03.470> hair<00:03:03.709> is<00:03:03.890> hydrated

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
to make sure that curly hair is hydrated

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.699 
to make sure that curly hair is hydrated

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
so that the coals don't begin to look

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.890 
so that the coals don't begin to look
