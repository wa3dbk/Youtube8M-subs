00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:13.320
 A 3/4 star score written in 3/8 beats 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:20.620
 I write it in 3/8 beats, so I'll try to sing along with my teacher 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:23.860
 Mee-Hoo 22 Day Slave Road 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:28.060
 Nude how Farfa 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:35.980
 You see, this is a quarter note 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:38.620
 Is 3 minutes in 1 night, so it's 3/4 beats and rewritten in this shelly 3/8 beats 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:46.149
 The problem is that 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:48.450
 This bird seen notes one by one each but it is what it is written in exactly the same wind to now this 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:57.660
 From the note length 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:59.190
 Half length cat This number is 4 pieces This number is 8 and this is steam rice 4- by 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.710
 But I city to 8 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:08.440
 I think I'm doing multiplication, but I'm a booboo but if this number fish gets bigger 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:13.840
 Soon it's pump one by one is thin enough to become 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:21.969
 I thought that it would be quick for the Reidou Reidodo fans to be funny 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:27.289
 This I it in it that I Would you like to write the score So half of the length of this 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:29.440
 I use it for things such as going on here in spiritual roads 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:32.650
 Extend in some this 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:36.420
 Yeah So half of Oh 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.420
 Number is two halves 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:47.410
 Some half of the 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:50.310
 Because this is a single house, it's 2 minutes here, so 1 piece will write in a non-post in this quarter rest this 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.900
 Take a break 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:58.560
 Is it ok 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:02:05.480
 One half and half one pay 1 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:08.720
 Do you little good now Te Kaku' in ne de Colle back each eighth note Tteyuu of the pasta 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:16.040
 What is that eighth note? 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:23.150
 Say this of I this that I said wrote me half the length but this has left the length of half 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:25.470
 Because it is not good when the three arranged to do this here connected by this I'd say manuscript 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.440
 Actually this is this 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:32.730
 The same length of 7 to say one advanced to this 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.730
 Well then I will write
