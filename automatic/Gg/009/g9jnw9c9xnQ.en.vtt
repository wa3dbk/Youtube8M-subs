00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
Patriots anyone to the bills and then he

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:14.910 
Patriots anyone to the bills and then he

got back to the Patriots and he was
really<00:03:15.040> happy<00:03:15.400> because<00:03:15.519> I<00:03:15.610> follow<00:03:15.910> him<00:03:16.120> on

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209
