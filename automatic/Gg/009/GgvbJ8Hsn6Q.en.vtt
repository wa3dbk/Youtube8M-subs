00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
be really focused in the classroom I

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.650 
be really focused in the classroom I
guess<00:00:33.660> because<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.489> do<00:00:35.489> go<00:00:35.670> away<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.940> lot<00:00:36.360> for

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
guess because you do go away a lot for

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.299 
guess because you do go away a lot for
like<00:00:36.840> hockey<00:00:37.170> weekend<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.980> so<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.160> gets

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
like hockey weekend and so it gets

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.360 
like hockey weekend and so it gets
difficult<00:00:38.610> sometimes<00:00:39.149> but<00:00:39.920> it's<00:00:40.920> just<00:00:41.100> kind

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
difficult sometimes but it's just kind

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.490 
difficult sometimes but it's just kind
of<00:00:41.399> being<00:00:41.610> focused<00:00:41.820> like<00:00:42.329> every<00:00:42.600> day<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.170> I

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500
