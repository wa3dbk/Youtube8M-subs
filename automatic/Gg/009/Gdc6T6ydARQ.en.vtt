00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.100 

okay<00:00:13.010> so<00:00:13.070> here<00:00:13.520> we<00:00:13.610> go<00:00:13.820> with<00:00:14.090> preparing<00:00:14.990> the

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:15.110 
okay so here we go with preparing the

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.500 
okay so here we go with preparing the
end<00:00:15.230> of<00:00:15.410> the<00:00:15.500> film<00:00:15.740> and<00:00:16.010> you<00:00:16.820> can<00:00:16.940> see<00:00:17.120> that<00:00:17.330> the

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.510 
end of the film and you can see that the

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.490 
end of the film and you can see that the
leader<00:00:18.020> is<00:00:18.170> cut<00:00:18.530> off<00:00:18.740> and<00:00:19.040> then<00:00:19.369> the<00:00:20.500> corners

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
leader is cut off and then the corners

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.820 
leader is cut off and then the corners
just<00:00:22.480> beveled<00:00:23.480> so<00:00:23.840> that<00:00:23.990> they<00:00:24.110> don't<00:00:24.230> stick<00:00:24.650> in

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
just beveled so that they don't stick in

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:32.090 
just beveled so that they don't stick in
the<00:00:24.980> real

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:32.100 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.530 

this<00:00:33.100> is<00:00:33.250> the<00:00:33.370> order<00:00:33.640> I<00:00:33.670> do<00:00:33.820> it<00:00:34.120> because<00:00:34.270> it's

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 
this is the order I do it because it's

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.639 
this is the order I do it because it's
important<00:00:35.110> to<00:00:35.969> close<00:00:36.969> the<00:00:37.270> clip<00:00:37.600> right<00:00:38.260> in<00:00:38.469> the

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:38.649 
important to close the clip right in the

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:40.860 
important to close the clip right in the
center<00:00:39.040> of<00:00:39.100> the<00:00:39.250> film<00:00:39.519> I<00:00:39.760> think<00:00:40.390> it's<00:00:40.510> easy<00:00:40.690> to

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
center of the film I think it's easy to

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.420 
center of the film I think it's easy to
do<00:00:41.110> that<00:00:41.879> with<00:00:42.879> the<00:00:43.350> film<00:00:44.350> and<00:00:44.620> strap<00:00:45.070> loose

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
do that with the film and strap loose

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.240 
do that with the film and strap loose
then<00:00:46.239> fastened<00:00:46.870> in<00:00:47.050> the<00:00:47.230> in<00:00:47.500> the<00:00:47.860> cassette

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
then fastened in the in the cassette

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.799 
then fastened in the in the cassette
holder<00:00:48.930> just<00:00:49.930> checking<00:00:50.470> that<00:00:50.649> it<00:00:50.829> is<00:00:51.010> actually

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
holder just checking that it is actually

holder just checking that it is actually
completely<00:00:52.809> central<00:00:55.739> then<00:00:56.739> the<00:00:56.860> strap<00:00:57.159> can<00:00:57.399> be

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
completely central then the strap can be

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.490 
completely central then the strap can be
round<00:00:57.729> on<00:00:57.970> a<00:00:58.000> bit<00:00:58.769> and<00:00:59.769> the<00:01:00.670> cassette<00:01:01.320> below<00:01:02.320> it

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:16.260 
into the holder and clicked into place
and<00:01:12.900> then<00:01:13.900> winding<00:01:14.590> the<00:01:14.770> film<00:01:15.610> just<00:01:15.790> a<00:01:15.939> short

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
and then winding the film just a short

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.060 
and then winding the film just a short
way<00:01:16.479> down<00:01:16.780> the<00:01:17.020> guide<00:01:17.229> to<00:01:17.530> make<00:01:17.710> sure<00:01:17.740> it's

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
way down the guide to make sure it's

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.890 
way down the guide to make sure it's
running<00:01:18.220> properly<00:01:18.640> and<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:20.680> lid<00:01:20.860> on<00:01:21.040> and

running properly and the lid on and

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.710 
running properly and the lid on and
that's<00:01:22.900> the<00:01:23.290> whole<00:01:23.740> tank<00:01:24.100> like<00:01:24.369> right<00:01:24.790> then

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
that's the whole tank like right then

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.160 
that's the whole tank like right then
you<00:01:25.840> can<00:01:25.990> start<00:01:26.259> winding<00:01:26.650> the<00:01:26.950> film<00:01:27.810> onto<00:01:28.810> the

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
you can start winding the film onto the

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.780 
you can start winding the film onto the
spiral<00:01:29.740> from<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.490> cassette<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:33.520> keep

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
spiral from the cassette you keep

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:40.780 
spiral from the cassette you keep
winding<00:01:34.530> steadily

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.340 

until<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.940> feel<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.860> end<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.160> film<00:01:44.400> held

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
until you feel the end of the film held

00:01:45.350 --> 00:02:09.620 
until you feel the end of the film held
by<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.410> cassette

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.730 

now<00:02:10.630> cup<00:02:11.260> turn<00:02:11.530> anymore<00:02:11.800> and<00:02:12.670> so<00:02:13.420> we<00:02:13.740> been

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
now cup turn anymore and so we been

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.740 
now cup turn anymore and so we been
trying<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.460> livre<00:02:15.670> for<00:02:16.600> the<00:02:16.690> knife<00:02:16.900> which

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
trying the livre for the knife which

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.410 
trying the livre for the knife which
cuts<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:19.960> film<00:02:20.140> just<00:02:20.920> by<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.250> cassette<00:02:21.790> and

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
cuts the film just by the cassette and

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.820 
cuts the film just by the cassette and
the<00:02:22.630> rest<00:02:22.840> of<00:02:22.990> the<00:02:23.140> film<00:02:24.130> is<00:02:24.310> wound<00:02:24.550> on<00:02:25.830> and

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
the rest of the film is wound on and

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:33.360 
the rest of the film is wound on and
then<00:02:27.100> we<00:02:27.340> can<00:02:27.520> add<00:02:28.240> the<00:02:28.270> developer<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:33.010> I

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
then we can add the developer and I

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.550 
then we can add the developer and I
start<00:02:34.330> the<00:02:34.480> clock<00:02:34.750> once<00:02:35.140> that's<00:02:35.410> done<00:02:37.560> keep

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
start the clock once that's done keep

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.890 
start the clock once that's done keep
winding<00:02:40.140> and<00:02:41.140> only<00:02:41.740> half<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.750> spiral<00:02:43.750> is

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
winding and only half the spiral is

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.790 
winding and only half the spiral is
exposed<00:02:44.500> to<00:02:45.450> developer<00:02:46.450> at<00:02:46.690> any<00:02:46.930> one<00:02:47.140> time<00:02:47.320> so

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
exposed to developer at any one time so

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.220 
exposed to developer at any one time so
you<00:02:47.890> have<00:02:48.100> to<00:02:48.250> keep<00:02:48.430> turning<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:50.020> whole

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
you have to keep turning the whole

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.500 
you have to keep turning the whole
development

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.280 

and<00:02:57.050> off<00:02:57.230> we<00:02:57.440> go<00:02:57.470> that's<00:02:58.430> now<00:02:58.700> turning

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
and off we go that's now turning

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:17.460 
and off we go that's now turning
steadily<00:03:03.670> the<00:03:04.670> entire<00:03:05.379> time

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.580 

I<00:03:17.500> start<00:03:18.280> pouring<00:03:18.550> about<00:03:19.000> twenty<00:03:19.930> fifteen<00:03:20.470> to

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
I start pouring about twenty fifteen to

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.850 
I start pouring about twenty fifteen to
twenty<00:03:20.920> seconds<00:03:21.430> before<00:03:21.580> the<00:03:21.910> end<00:03:21.940> of

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
twenty seconds before the end of

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:29.640 
twenty seconds before the end of
development<00:03:27.600> film<00:03:28.600> is<00:03:28.780> still<00:03:28.990> developing

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
development film is still developing

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.920 
development film is still developing
obviously<00:03:30.490> as<00:03:30.640> as<00:03:30.970> the<00:03:31.180> solution<00:03:31.600> is<00:03:31.690> being

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
obviously as as the solution is being

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:43.800 
obviously as as the solution is being
poured<00:03:32.290> out<00:03:33.390> in<00:03:34.390> goes<00:03:34.840> for<00:03:35.140> these<00:03:42.810> still

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
poured out in goes for these still

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:52.260 
poured out in goes for these still
turning

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:04:02.440 

quick<00:03:53.270> rinse<00:03:55.660> pulled<00:03:56.660> away<00:03:59.500> this<00:04:00.500> shows<00:04:01.450> three

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
quick rinse pulled away this shows three

winces as in the ICO instructions I only
want<00:04:05.030> normally<00:04:05.600> rinse<00:04:05.810> twice<00:04:11.170> then<00:04:12.170> the<00:04:12.350> fixer

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:12.740 
want normally rinse twice then the fixer

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:26.190 
want normally rinse twice then the fixer
goes<00:04:12.920> in<00:04:15.970> again<00:04:16.970> turning

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.770 

two<00:04:26.830> minute<00:04:27.160> fixing<00:04:27.670> period<00:04:28.030> coming<00:04:28.360> to<00:04:28.660> an

two minute fixing period coming to an
end<00:04:28.930> and<00:04:29.260> then<00:04:29.980> the<00:04:30.160> fix<00:04:30.370> is<00:04:30.580> poured<00:04:30.880> out<00:04:35.970> and

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
end and then the fix is poured out and

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.590 
end and then the fix is poured out and
move<00:04:37.330> the<00:04:37.680> lid<00:04:38.680> at<00:04:38.860> this<00:04:39.040> stage<00:04:39.600> because

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
move the lid at this stage because

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.560 
move the lid at this stage because
that's<00:04:41.020> the<00:04:41.170> film<00:04:41.410> processed<00:04:42.250> but<00:04:43.150> not<00:04:43.330> get

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
that's the film processed but not get

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:59.590 
that's the film processed but not get
washed

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.800 

now<00:05:00.290> you<00:05:00.350> can<00:05:00.530> either<00:05:00.680> wash<00:05:01.010> the<00:05:01.250> film<00:05:01.810> by

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
now you can either wash the film by

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.860 
now you can either wash the film by
putting<00:05:03.170> the<00:05:03.290> tank<00:05:03.560> under<00:05:04.040> running<00:05:04.850> water<00:05:04.970> or

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
putting the tank under running water or

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:13.290 
putting the tank under running water or
by<00:05:06.260> successive<00:05:06.980> water<00:05:07.220> changes<00:05:10.540> this<00:05:11.540> is<00:05:11.690> by

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
by successive water changes this is by

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:30.559 
by successive water changes this is by
successive<00:05:14.300> water<00:05:14.510> changes<00:05:15.110> I'm<00:05:15.320> shown

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:30.569 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:32.989 

just<00:05:31.169> keep<00:05:31.409> going<00:05:31.679> firm<00:05:32.009> any<00:05:32.189> water<00:05:32.399> changes

00:05:32.989 --> 00:05:32.999 
just keep going firm any water changes

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:34.969 
just keep going firm any water changes
you<00:05:33.509> think<00:05:33.749> necessary<00:05:33.990> for<00:05:34.589> the<00:05:34.679> particular

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
you think necessary for the particular

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:45.330 
you think necessary for the particular
film

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:50.650 

think<00:05:46.340> I<00:05:46.460> did<00:05:46.610> about<00:05:46.850> ten<00:05:47.180> for<00:05:47.479> this<00:05:47.600> film<00:05:49.660> and

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:50.660 
think I did about ten for this film and

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.469 
think I did about ten for this film and
then<00:05:50.840> in<00:05:51.020> the<00:05:51.139> final<00:05:51.350> wash<00:05:51.710> water<00:05:52.069> just<00:05:52.789> a<00:05:52.940> few

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:53.479 
then in the final wash water just a few

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:56.830 
then in the final wash water just a few
drops<00:05:53.660> of<00:05:53.870> wetting<00:05:54.259> agent<00:05:55.690> probably<00:05:56.690> not

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
drops of wetting agent probably not

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.909 
drops of wetting agent probably not
necessary<00:05:57.410> but<00:05:57.680> I've<00:05:57.860> always<00:05:59.470> used<00:06:00.470> wetting

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:00.919 
necessary but I've always used wetting

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:12.730 
necessary but I've always used wetting
agent

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:18.400 

and<00:06:13.310> that's<00:06:13.520> a<00:06:14.080> film<00:06:15.080> finished<00:06:17.290> and<00:06:18.290> they

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:18.410 
and that's a film finished and they

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.960 
and that's a film finished and they
removed<00:06:19.480> and<00:06:20.480> cried
