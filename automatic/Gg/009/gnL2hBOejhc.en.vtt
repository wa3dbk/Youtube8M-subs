00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.100
 Hi everyone! Welcome to another video on 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.450
 channel 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.140
 today we are going to discuss a subject 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:26.650
 different that is related to old push 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:29.710
 on the gasoline vapor you already have 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.470
 heard but there is even a car and 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.430
 makes 40 kilometers per liter made in 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.900
 Japan 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:39.280
 so I'm going to do some tests today 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:41.800
 using this kind of technique to 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.440
 to vaporize gasoline and so you 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.890
 work only cuba by hers or otherwise 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.680
 to use its own liquid is injecting into 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.750
 nozzles or charge the pain 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:57.489
 so you have a much bigger economy 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:01:00.129
 rather than using the fuel itself 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:03.989
 so that's what I use, I used it here 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:08.670
 to make this experience is a glass of 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:11.710
 olives with a konkola lid of 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.680
 high temperature silicone used in a 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.540
 car head is a valve 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:21.430
 dino gas bottle 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:24.730
 is oy in a cap to put the 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.610
 fuel as soon as it ceases here. 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:31.000
 to remove the remaining oil. 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:34.570
 a hanging hose that will not reach the 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:39.310
 background it is more or less the three 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:41.950
 centimeters before the start and one 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.680
 goes to the bottom of the fuel is this 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.500
 that goes to the bottom of the fuel it is 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:51.040
 connected to the valve inside and this 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.980
 valve is connected to this buoy 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:59.530
 It's true that this car camera 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:02:02.560
 I 'm going to make the budget here. 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.770
 inside so it creates bubbles 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:09.129
 in her is she sobe she enters this 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.569
 and goes out by that beak here that 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:14.080
 I call this beak burned here. 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:17.379
 used is a part of an iron 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.569
 solder that had spoiled so he discovers 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:21.790
 He took it out here is a part of 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.960
 aluminum inside the iron. 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.810
 rubber solder 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.010
 leave here I 'll show you how 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.810
 it works 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:34.220
 when you call back here to 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:38.180
 controlling the air intake right 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.670
 begins to produce gasoline vapor 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.550
 no, the gas goes up 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:47.240
 It will go out there on the burner so I go. 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:51.320
 oblige those who sell 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:55.190
 Look, you see, the flame is gone, right? 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:59.030
 you can use this gas in generators 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:02.180
 gasoline can use this gas motorcycle can 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.700
 use in car can even kill together 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.860
 with hydrogen is who knows 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.740
 economy is not greater since hydrogen 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.870
 does not work alone is at least what 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.720
 We know what works today. 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.840
 together with the possible is in the case of 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:21.950
 gasoline and now how about joining hydrogen 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:25.400
 vapor and eliminate is the use of 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:29.840
 direct fuel and here I use the 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:33.020
 regulator for air intake and running 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:39.070
 increasing increasing the flame looks 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:39.070
 interesting flame 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.820
 and I'm one week with this little 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.620
 here is fuel do not do this 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:52.450
 experience 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:54.250
 and it really takes too much time to gasoline if 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.350
 actually not because in the 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.410
 gasoline there is a bit dark because 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:01.780
 generates steam and enough of it then goes 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:07.090
 this oil being in that color of oil in 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:10.630
 low is heavier it goes down but it is 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:13.750
 much and stuck in the middle of the year I saw that 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:16.060
 it really is feasible to work search 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.739
 on top of that for who will use 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.530
 generators who spends a lot of fuel 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:23.190
 for generators can now use the 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:27.520
 gasoline and have an economy of 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:30.670
 The bigger the staff if you liked the video 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.790
 then click I like it, it's sharing in the 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:37.470
 facebook this idea, and sign up for 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.470
 channel and until the next
