00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.789
 so my joÃ£o 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:17.499
 and the holy city 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:19.359
 the new jerusalem 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:22.169
 coming down from heaven is the presence of God 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:23.880
 dressed as a bride 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.069
 to pain nothing to his 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:29.779
 after a thousand sabbatical years in heaven 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.030
 List the redeemed with the new Jerusalem return to earth 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.290
 when approaching the planet's city is bleak 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.960
 Jesus commands the wicked to come back to life from the dust of the earth. 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.470
 at your command 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.309
 the wicked of all ages and places 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:49.400
 resurrected 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.400
 the same way they died 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.400
 and there they stand before God 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.700
 to jesus to be 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.130
 if people and with the mount of olive trees 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.880
 a tremendous earthquake 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.880
 there was a mountain turning into a great plain 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.280
 So 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.970
 the new jerusalem 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.159
 the great city of god woven salles and rests its structure 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.159
 over the goalkeeper's goalie 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.560
 now 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.570
 when the thousand years are over 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.400
 satan will be released from his prison 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.400
 and then go after deceiving the nations 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.950
 fitness to war 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.690
 incredibly 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.140
 Satan is able to win followers once more and 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.140
 capture the heavenly city by force 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.280
 generals and admirals and that is of all times 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.680
 together or in their abilities to prepare and separate what they imagine 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.090
 be the monumental battle 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.530
 by this act 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.460
 the Indians will reveal that their hearts did not convert 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.430
 If it was possible 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.310
 they would destroy the holy city by force 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.260
 little do they realize that this futile war was already lost even 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.799
 begin 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:17.799
 The judge finally arrived. 

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:22.029
 so I saw the dead big and small 

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:24.719
 all before God 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:26.859
 books were opened 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:30.169
 and the dead were judged according to their charm 

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:33.390
 suddenly 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.390
 on high above the city the Lord appears his glorious 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:41.720
 all fragile war plans do not immediately get knocked out 

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:45.549
 when contemplating in the face of God 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.480
 concepts become painfully aware of each of their sins 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.739
 they remember each moment in which their consciences began 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.629
 every time they denied those called to justice 

00:02:59.649 --> 00:03:03.680
 many were buried along with their sinful secrets 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.170
 wanting to successfully 'hide' all his murders and crimes 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:10.740
 shamefully experimental firsthand 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.280
 the words of jesus that said lukas because it is nothing covered that will not be 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.249
 revealed 

00:03:16.249 --> 00:03:17.739
 in the time contained 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.099
 that will not be known 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:24.590
 by presenting to them the 'panorama of their lives 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.979
 every minute you completely understand it 

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:30.579
 who by their own choice choose to have rejected salvation 

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:34.749
 tragically 

00:03:34.749 --> 00:03:37.679
 the peace and joy of those in the city 

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:41.449
 never be enjoyed by the Indians is a feeling of despair and without 

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:44.449
 hope are broken and left speechless 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:50.040
 the rebels can not deny the justice of God by pleading guilty 

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:52.869
 in one voice with the hand 

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:55.969
 schuster true are your organization paths 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.039
 falling prostrate they adore the prince of the daughter 

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:08.679
 they went up to the corners of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints 

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:13.509
 then I fell the fire of heaven from the consuming gods 

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:20.459
 time to face the irreversible consequences of their 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.099
 actions 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:24.310
 without any warning 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.860
 fire and sulfur fell from the sky 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.819
 stand forward 

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:31.819
 the project caters underground caves 

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:36.020
 while reporting simple shrinks 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.949
 the righteous are the salvini security within the gates of the new jerusalem 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.779
 every applicator and punished according to their sins 

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:49.309
 afterwards with few sins are quickly destroyed as the 

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:52.739
 guilty of horrible sins against humanity have suffered more 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:57.679
 bastard instigator of all sins who will be forced to suffer much more 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.870
 for god the punishment of civilians and a willful act 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:05.409
 but it is something that only justice demands 

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:08.939
 the salary of sin is death 

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:10.009
 On the cross 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:13.789
 Jesus suffered the ultimate punishment in place of all who accepted his 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:15.509
 sacrifice 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:19.900
 but tragically lost points have rejected this gift 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.900
 and will have to pay the price for their own sins 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.759
 Certainly the day will turn 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:31.930
 burning out of the area 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.449
 all the proud of all the weak will be consumed 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.270
 You scored the goals. 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.270
 then they will be like systems and their feet 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.740
 to advise them on the destruction of 

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:51.979
 the inhabitants of the whole universe in their voices in praise of God so coming from 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:54.979
 car of satan has been banished forever 

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:59.619
 it was thus with peace in the eternally guaranteed kosmos 

00:05:59.619 --> 00:06:03.419
 now devote his attention to the creation of a new heaven and a new 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:03.779
 Earth
