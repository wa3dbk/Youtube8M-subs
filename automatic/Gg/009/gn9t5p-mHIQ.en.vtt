listen<00:06:18.360> have<00:06:19.170> you<00:06:19.320> ever<00:06:19.470> seen<00:06:19.680> a<00:06:19.740> warehouse

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:20.040 
listen have you ever seen a warehouse

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:24.800 
listen have you ever seen a warehouse
full<00:06:20.580> of<00:06:20.640> nuclear<00:06:21.150> material<00:06:22.070> no<00:06:23.600> problems<00:06:24.600> and

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:24.810 
full of nuclear material no problems and

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.190 
full of nuclear material no problems and
drums<00:06:25.140> of<00:06:25.560> nuclear<00:06:25.950> waste<00:06:26.190> stacked<00:06:27.000> aside<00:06:27.450> as

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:28.200 
drums of nuclear waste stacked aside as

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.980 
drums of nuclear waste stacked aside as
far<00:06:28.560> as<00:06:28.680> you<00:06:28.800> can<00:06:28.980> see<00:06:29.270> because<00:06:30.270> there's<00:06:30.720> still

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 
far as you can see because there's still

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.730 
far as you can see because there's still
no<00:06:31.650> real<00:06:32.160> way<00:06:32.490> to<00:06:33.090> use<00:06:33.390> it<00:06:33.420> or<00:06:33.870> dispose<00:06:34.410> of<00:06:34.440> it

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740 
no real way to use it or dispose of it

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.220 
no real way to use it or dispose of it
so<00:06:35.460> they<00:06:35.610> just<00:06:35.640> closed<00:06:36.120> the<00:06:36.330> lid<00:06:36.540> and<00:06:36.750> try<00:06:37.140> to

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:37.230 
so they just closed the lid and try to

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.830 
so they just closed the lid and try to
pretend<00:06:37.590> like<00:06:37.770> it'll<00:06:37.980> go<00:06:38.130> away<00:06:38.840> essentially

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840
