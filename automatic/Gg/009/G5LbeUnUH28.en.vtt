00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.050
 Welcome to the unicorns me 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.240
 am minister and i will show you today 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.450
 how to have comic 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:18.180
 For this we like to use felt chair 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.400
 because there is a lot of small stuff paper 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.720
 and pen to sign and of course 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.449
 also a ruler scissors to cut out 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.789
 rubber band and as always all glue 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.719
 our friend and helper or as live 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.550
 that she thinks about this time first 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.140
 what kind of board do you want there 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.960
 No matter what you write on it 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.360
 I want to power today 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.910
 That's why I start with the speech bubble 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.039
 where the thing is in it then comes 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.260
 a smaller balloon and then comes 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:59.670
 The couple could be targeted for the first time 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:01.350
 works is anna I think so 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.789
 okay you can if you do it properly 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.640
 just want all the lines again 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.780
 Mark with a ruler or 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.680
 trace but otherwise cuts 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.909
 you simply sour with the ship 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.439
 Now the team is cut out because 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.330
 we need it as a template for the 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.799
 including the shadow is now greater 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.000
 cut it out properly 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:23.310
 I have to admit to my shame that 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.790
 I never was a great comic reader 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.270
 I always read differently and there 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.250
 There is also a lot of book and pound ca 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.930
 but an American comics anyway 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.050
 that was never really my thing and me 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.910
 I am only then by clichÃ© 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.450
 A fender moderately by the comic company 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.620
 come on and yes that's a lot 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.660
 Money is always cost if you are 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.560
 Come next to me that's all 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.600
 a bit out of the hip 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.979
 decided how big that is but you 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.840
 Of course you can from your head to 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.220
 weeping and big wanted every hair where 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:59.550
 exactly should sit 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:00.300
 That may not be safe 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.640
 cut out 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.860
 Now we put the whole thing out again 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.040
 paper and draw it as one 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.040
 template 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.840
 so now i have finished painting now 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.170
 needs outside around that again a little 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.810
 made larger about 0.5 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.940
 to 1 cm depending on how the lynx a 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.490
 such a shadow or a black one 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.050
 bordering on the final for the 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.550
 want to have this exactly the 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.230
 Now take a ruler and measure 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:35.470
 always exactly the distances after 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.470
 So people like me just paint 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.630
 the second part then again 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:45.220
 do not want to cut it with it 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.220
 intimate line but now the outer one 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:51.629
 Now our two parts have finished 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.750
 and now the difficult comes namely 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:56.879
 that you can enjoy the internet 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.530
 then try a comic on it 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:00.269
 make computer and simply print 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.189
 or you draw the peer cock ever 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.290
 after how talented 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:05.909
 I try this by hand 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.239
 fritzen, let's see how it looks 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:11.489
 ends I now take the smaller part 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.260
 and draftsman and circle around it all 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.000
 easy just so I know about how 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.200
 the brow does not have to be that big 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.620
 after that is so and you see at all 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.620
 nothing more 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.159
 if you have finished drawing then 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.239
 you cut it all out and then 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:32.870
 we are already so far that we at 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.870
 can draw 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.900
 so very filigree little things here in 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.590
 In the middle you take you such a mini 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.360
 mini 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.050
 the craft scissors or nail clippers 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.050
 it works too 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:54.150
 my coal scissors saw the experience 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.760
 our pauls ready now you want yours 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:12.010
 felt and kuli or a filter and 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.420
 designate the whole on for my greatest 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.790
 I take black now because that will be 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:19.680
 the shadow and that is you just 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.680
 her on the movie 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.630
 if you cut out the first one 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.950
 now becomes very serious and now you can 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.990
 we are not so halligalli here anymore 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.360
 but we have to draw a bit 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.010
 Be careful when felt when he is 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.390
 has burned out corners and that's how it is 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.370
 everything a little stupid too that him 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.810
 because you have then get a cool one 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.780
 tailor's scissors that's all it takes 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:46.140
 bit neat and occurs at the fabric 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.580
 The scissors are also on the cutting edge 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.950
 to leave a table that's a bit 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.750
 unfamiliar at the beginning but so I have 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.520
 Anyway, an apprenticeship then learned 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.510
 Do not wiggle around and do not yell 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.340
 then it's all a bit 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:00.330
 stable 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:01.470
 but the first is ready then if it is 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.270
 you too many could first one 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.590
 take a break and read a comic or 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.680
 we'll continue with that right away 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.680
 next 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.879
 what are your favorite ones? 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.999
 comics one searches then always also 

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:16.259
 comics and how horny and then catches 

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:17.849
 to read one then pleases his 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:20.129
 next to be something else coming the 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:21.840
 is full of the process and I would 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:25.159
 like to know what is not identical or 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.159
 what about your favorite comics 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:39.900
 happens if you are a bit early 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:43.350
 got up and I have that 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:45.750
 women just launched 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.610
 so and now you think everything right 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.020
 but you can see them everywhere 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.840
 signs lines and if thats me 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:55.770
 turn around 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:58.170
 that's what's wrong with that since 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.450
 smarter than me and puts it right 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:01.920
 mirrored on what am I doing now 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:05.180
 quickly cut that now properly 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.180
 now just the sign lines 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.030
 if no stupid mistakes made here 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.500
 I should have a bit like me then 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:18.050
 finished earlier and then sees the whole thing 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.520
 Now, look, and the only thing we do 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.259
 now need is a piece to 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.500
 band and thus we measure our head 

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:23.500
 from 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:35.840
 not too loose so for my head 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:37.680
 I need about 48 50 cm 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.380
 Now we'll take it all again 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:43.620
 apart and keep only the 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:46.050
 black layer look down here where 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:51.210
 The middle of the rubber band is that 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:53.280
 here in the middle and then we need 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.910
 quite a lot of glue because that has to 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.910
 yes keep well 

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:01.470
 with the power is exactly the same 

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:04.410
 set out on the left side, the 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:07.980
 glue and then place well and need 

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:09.210
 so we are the hardest press 

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:13.020
 already finished now we do 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:19.400
 behind only a small knot and 

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:19.400
 but then we have as a chain 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.600
 of course that was very smart now 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.160
 black background to take on mine 

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:30.130
 black hair but if her blonde 

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.240
 or have colorful hair then you can see that 

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:32.560
 Definitely good, but I think so now 

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.919
 Actually, you can see it as well or 

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:37.750
 Wow for those who are too lazy now 

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:39.370
 to make at home was lost this 

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:41.410
 nice part just write me down 

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:43.990
 in the comments what yours 

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:45.100
 superheroes power the funniest win 

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:46.780
 part 

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:48.009
 I hope you understood everything 

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:50.949
 I like to write our in the 

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:52.419
 comments which you want to see 

00:07:50.949 --> 00:07:52.990
 or generally what you see more 

00:07:52.419 --> 00:07:55.180
 want 

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:57.190
 otherwise see you next time 

00:07:55.180 --> 00:08:02.590
 video again follows me everywhere 

00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:04.150
 instagram twitter facebook and think 

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:07.949
 Every new subscriber ensures that 

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:07.949
 that a unicorn get its wings
