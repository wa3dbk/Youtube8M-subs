00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.880
 leaning on the fence that divides mexico 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.680
 from the United States dona felicia lópez 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.900
 sells food in front of the airport 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.839
 I can not stay like that with 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.699
 arms crossed if why because I 

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:16.350
 I also have to eat that I drink tea in 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:18.650
 a minute a little grandson that goes in the 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.359
 school and I have to support it myself 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.179
 for 14 years I work in a store 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.189
 inside the air terminal a month ago 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:28.289
 the owner closed the business arguing 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.449
 that they raised the rent too much already 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:35.300
 my age did not see me who gave me 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.300
 a job that's why I'm here you learn 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.570
 how is this woman worker of 60 years 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.370
 many have remained in the 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.870
 unemployment for the modernization of 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.060
 Tijuana airport that was 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.530
 concessioned to a Spanish company makes 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.480
 more than a decade 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.890
 Pacific airport group is 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.379
 who builds this bridge that 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.330
 will allow the travelers of the USA to cross 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:59.140
 the border directly to your terminal 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:01.210
 aerial and a lot of tourism that 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.250
 I did not want to do the queues to enter 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.590
 to tijuana will not be directly to 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.630
 through this international crossing of 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.520
 On the other hand, the US government 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.009
 build the facilities where 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.479
 migration and customs will review entries and 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.700
 departures from the passage but will not connect 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:19.030
 with the world not just touristy 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.369
 but the investment theme 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.170
 the binational terminal will be unique in its 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.270
 type but not everyone sees it as a 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.100
 benefit your business where a few 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.900
 and endangering again the 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.549
 city of tijuana several aldermen of 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.229
 tijuana argue that the bridge will 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.880
 builds without complying with all 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.369
 rules like the impact study 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.369
 environmental some want to stop the 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.440
 project why that was not done 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.380
 project within the airport that already 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.110
 exists in the city of San Diego because 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.790
 they send it to this Mexican side because 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.910
 they know that well they have 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.850
 said truth we are the backyard the 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.320
 US dustbin Taxi Drivers 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.539
 they cater to airport travelers 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.929
 they also doubt the impact of the project 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:03.220
 that would bring more planes to the border in 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:05.860
 the benefits affect us in certain 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.360
 ways there are negative contributors not what 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.830
 positive of that is that is supposed 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.660
 to increase the flow of 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.550
 tourism here to the city of tijuana and going 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.350
 increase a little visit him 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.360
 that can generate us other trips in the 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.450
 regional sense also what we 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.220
 affects is that much of the flow 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.380
 of passengers that we are going to be 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.840
 San Isidro and NATO booths 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.870
 can affect by 30% 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.360
 what they are they enter less taxis doña 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.540
 felicia has no doubts and so I say 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.060
 to the president to remember that his 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.190
 bridge that came to be is not well done 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.140
 how many unemployed people are staying and 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.580
 how many will be more we try 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.650
 communicate with the airport group 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.629
 of the Pacific but they did not respond to 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.870
 our messages the bridge could 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:51.910
 start working in 2016 in 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.430
 tijuana vicente calderón tijuana brest 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.200
 dotcom the state government always 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.230
 is looking to offer more opportunities 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.630
 for all opportunity is investment 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.700
 to help with good credits to micro 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.010
 small and medium-sized companies so that 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.110
 can grow opportunity is more 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.360
 jobs for everyone in construction 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.910
 of dozens of works across the state 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.920
 in 2014 baja california was the state 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.980
 that more jobs generated in Mexico by 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.190
 every thousand inhabitants and in 2015 we are going 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.190
 plus
