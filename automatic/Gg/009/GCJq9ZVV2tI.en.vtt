here it actually would seem to be a lot
of<00:01:30.030> fun<00:01:30.119> actually<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.990> does<00:01:31.320> take<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.560> little

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
of fun actually it does take a little

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.200 
of fun actually it does take a little
bit<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:31.920> time<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.220> get<00:01:32.340> this<00:01:32.490> done<00:01:32.759> but<00:01:32.970> once

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
bit of time to get this done but once

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.090 
bit of time to get this done but once
you<00:01:33.329> guys<00:01:33.479> do<00:01:33.840> get<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.200> down<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.680> timing

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
you guys do get it down the timing

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.429 
you guys do get it down the timing
factor<00:01:35.520> it's<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.150> really<00:01:36.420> easy<00:01:36.509> glitch<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.259> do

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
factor it's a really easy glitch to do
