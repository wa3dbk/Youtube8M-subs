00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 okay then what are we going to do 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.839
 let's make a piece of my game that 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.230
 it's really huge 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:09.230
 we have been here 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:21.150
 come on, it's quite long 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.740
 as you will see later it is worth and we are going to 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.119
 start is first come here guys 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.599
 by the game of gravity is it worth to 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.160
 josemi you have the most honors to this 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.570
 game works with severity because 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.520
 we are in space then if I 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.130
 jump here as you see change the severity 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.130
 and it's a bit complicated you can 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.809
 to yellow first 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.090
 we go 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.090
 what I did shower 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.850
 let's go to the white zone 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.800
 here 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.810
 they are falling uncle is worth it if we die there 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.200
 have to start over with those things so 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.200
 we trust you 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:19.690
 if necessary 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.690
 and I get it 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.980
 This care because he can send you 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.980
 until jupiter is the thing 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.909
 to see says it's so easy to lend the 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:02.560
 Most do not fuck me, do not be for a 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:02.560
 picture that has happened to me 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:11.510
 here what is called in the 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.280
 centrifuge is multiple has 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:18.129
 multiple gravity is social depends on 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:21.200
 the area that is of the gravity 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:22.700
 but if I kill myself first because you do not have 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.109
 to follow the authentic gravity where 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.280
 there is gravity and it depends where it goes 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:27.379
 changing the novelty then it's where 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.620
 you have to go getting what I'm 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:29.620
 getting 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:51.099
 the trick is to the right the gravity 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.170
 when it's coming 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.970
 here 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.989
 do not 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:40.419
 it's bullshit 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:00.669
 3 

00:05:02.019 --> 00:05:11.049
 coming backwards 

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:26.079
 the turn 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:36.639
 from this Mexican side 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.759
 and later 

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:55.060
 get here 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.500
 it is impossible is impossible 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:29.530
 in the next pass the next 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.530
 pass 

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:44.230
 let's get there 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.860
 musicians and up to here the video after 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.810
 we have to go through the forest 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.640
 delighted that then you will see that it is a 

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.330
 action of family and game and by 

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.550
 hammers 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:03.439
 by the shocking blankets this 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:05.539
 funny nothing the race 1 finished 

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:07.849
 that now we will see and I tell you I'm going 

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:09.169
 to win you now have the group channel 

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:10.370
 if you want to go through his video game but 

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:13.389
 you will have and until the next 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:13.389
 bye Bye
