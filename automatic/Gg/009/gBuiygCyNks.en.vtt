00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.450
 there are already over 5 million cars 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.670
 toyota hybrid and circulating on the roads 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.920
 all over the world the new minivan of 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.870
 toyota prius plus inherits the same 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.789
 philosophy giving further result le 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.289
 functionality through the increase of 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.400
 internal dimensions and modularity 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.380
 cabin 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.730
 if the pitch is 8 centimeters long e 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.949
 the dimensions increase proportionately 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.170
 exterior prius plus is longer than 13 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.660
 centimeters with respect to prius wider than 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.880
 3 centimeters higher than nine excellent 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.250
 and they told us 28 with 17 tires 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.620
 7- inch inches with relative 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.000
 adjustment of internal volumes 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.530
 constitute the main novelty 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.050
 these are seven armchairs i 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.340
 employees adjustable separately 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.260
 distribute the two seats in three rows 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.300
 front in addition to normal adjustments 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.219
 they can be completely tilted 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.170
 to form a single plan with those 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.480
 central ones in turn the latter 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.370
 they can slide back and forth up 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.559
 to offer 50 centimeters for the legs 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.539
 occupants and fold up at the level 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.190
 of the boot loading floor below 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.439
 of which the third row of 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.320
 seats two armchairs a little more 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.460
 sacrificed but not up to 50 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.570
 kilometers from the traction area 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.520
 exclusively electric 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.920
 the driving is quiet and comfortable is 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.150
 the two thermal engines are very pleasant 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.909
 and electric guarantee an excellent 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.340
 thrust with a total power of 136 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.619
 horses to understand how when i 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.330
 two cooperate propellers just throw away 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.130
 the eye on the screen with the flows of 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.229
 energy of the touch navigator and in gold 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.479
 plus following the indications of the system 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.310
 hybrid synergy drive you can 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.990
 regenerate energy and break down the 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.670
 consumption a type of driving other than 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.500
 what we are used to but with the 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.180
 which species turning in traffic yes 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.770
 they can have really big 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.909
 satisfactions and go even more than 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.039
 25 km 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.840
 the on-board equipment offers everything 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:47.359
 almost what is innovative

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.379
 through a graphical menu that appears 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:15.810
 on the instrument panel and on the dap displays 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:17.519
 entry and smart system can be entered into 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.349
 car without extracting the keys of the 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.579
 pocket or bag to start the 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.680
 car simply press the

 panoramic was a play daytime running lights a 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.470
 led toyota prius plus does not aim at 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.910
 style because its design is strongly 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.349
 conditioned by needs 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.879
 of aerodynamics and those of the 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.739
 interior space does not promise strong 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.390
 emotions not even an exciting guide 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.190
 it is not luxurious but strong 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.660
 personality sacrifices everything in favor 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.370
 functionalities and efficiencies 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.230
 for those who are sensitive to respect 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.209
 the environment with record consumption with 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.130
 minimum level of pollution plus splas 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.730
 still grants more services than 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.810
 dignified 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.090
 the potential of this car 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.599
 specific are huge enough to learn a
