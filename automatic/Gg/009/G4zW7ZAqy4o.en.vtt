00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
forecast well you know our stance was

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.500 
forecast well you know our stance was
actually<00:00:50.750> confirmed<00:00:51.430> by<00:00:52.430> the<00:00:52.489> reaction<00:00:53.060> of

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
actually confirmed by the reaction of

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.360 
actually confirmed by the reaction of
global<00:00:53.960> markets<00:00:54.410> to<00:00:55.280> the<00:00:56.260> mention<00:00:57.260> of

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
global markets to the mention of

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.760 
global markets to the mention of
tapering<00:00:58.370> by<00:00:58.640> the<00:00:58.700> Federal<00:00:59.149> Reserve<00:00:59.420> Board

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770 
tapering by the Federal Reserve Board

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.090 
tapering by the Federal Reserve Board
our<00:01:00.850> logic<00:01:01.850> really<00:01:02.270> on<00:01:02.510> a<00:01:03.110> lot<00:01:03.500> of<00:01:03.620> commodity

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
our logic really on a lot of commodity

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.550 
our logic really on a lot of commodity
prices<00:01:04.550> has<00:01:04.699> had<00:01:04.940> to<00:01:05.089> do<00:01:05.300> with<00:01:05.570> the<00:01:05.780> fact<00:01:05.990> that

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
prices has had to do with the fact that

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.980 
prices has had to do with the fact that
we've<00:01:06.770> had<00:01:07.300> conditions<00:01:08.300> of<00:01:08.420> excessive

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
we've had conditions of excessive

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.900 
we've had conditions of excessive
liquidity<00:01:09.380> inside<00:01:09.920> of<00:01:10.070> the<00:01:10.130> marketplace<00:01:10.700> and

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:10.910 
liquidity inside of the marketplace and

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.570 
liquidity inside of the marketplace and
so<00:01:11.060> this<00:01:11.210> has<00:01:11.420> been<00:01:11.570> stimulative<00:01:12.320> not<00:01:13.310> just

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
so this has been stimulative not just

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.609 
so this has been stimulative not just
for<00:01:13.729> gold<00:01:14.000> and<00:01:14.240> other<00:01:14.509> precious<00:01:14.630> metals<00:01:15.050> but

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
for gold and other precious metals but

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.310 
for gold and other precious metals but
also<00:01:15.890> for<00:01:16.430> base<00:01:16.850> metals<00:01:16.880> out<00:01:17.750> there<00:01:17.990> in<00:01:18.110> some

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
also for base metals out there in some

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.059 
also for base metals out there in some
other<00:01:18.440> commodities<00:01:19.100> as<00:01:19.280> well<00:01:19.780> and<00:01:20.780> so<00:01:21.649> on<00:01:21.860> may

00:01:22.059 --> 00:01:22.069 
other commodities as well and so on may

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:25.270 
other commodities as well and so on may
22nd<00:01:22.910> when<00:01:23.149> Fed<00:01:23.959> Chairman<00:01:24.319> Bernanke<00:01:24.590> came<00:01:25.069> out

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
22nd when Fed Chairman Bernanke came out

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.169 
22nd when Fed Chairman Bernanke came out
and<00:01:25.600> hinted<00:01:26.600> that<00:01:26.630> some<00:01:27.170> of<00:01:27.289> these<00:01:27.530> huge

00:01:28.169 --> 00:01:28.179 
and hinted that some of these huge

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:31.510 
and hinted that some of these huge
purchases<00:01:29.179> were<00:01:29.390> maybe<00:01:30.050> going<00:01:30.649> to<00:01:30.860> be<00:01:31.009> dialed

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
purchases were maybe going to be dialed

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.090 
purchases were maybe going to be dialed
down<00:01:31.729> slightly<00:01:32.600> in<00:01:33.110> the<00:01:33.140> marketplace<00:01:33.800> they

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
down slightly in the marketplace they

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.630 
down slightly in the marketplace they
roiled<00:01:34.700> markets<00:01:35.270> and<00:01:35.479> it<00:01:36.170> did<00:01:36.440> confirm<00:01:36.979> indeed

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
roiled markets and it did confirm indeed

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.719 
roiled markets and it did confirm indeed
that<00:01:38.179> when<00:01:38.420> former<00:01:38.899> forward<00:01:39.619> pricing<00:01:39.920> started

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
that when former forward pricing started

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.219 
that when former forward pricing started
to<00:01:40.819> affect<00:01:40.910> the<00:01:41.270> market<00:01:41.450> for<00:01:41.869> certain

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
to affect the market for certain

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.410 
to affect the market for certain
commodities<00:01:42.740> but<00:01:43.220> this<00:01:43.459> was<00:01:43.759> a<00:01:43.789> segment<00:01:44.330> of

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
commodities but this was a segment of

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.760 
commodities but this was a segment of
the<00:01:44.539> market<00:01:44.720> that<00:01:45.110> traders<00:01:45.470> were<00:01:45.619> now

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
the market that traders were now

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.130 
the market that traders were now
acknowledging<00:01:46.580> had<00:01:47.060> experienced<00:01:47.810> a<00:01:47.899> fair

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
acknowledging had experienced a fair

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.800 
acknowledging had experienced a fair
amount<00:01:48.259> of<00:01:48.619> excessive<00:01:49.220> activity<00:01:49.780> over<00:01:50.780> the

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
amount of excessive activity over the

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.109 
amount of excessive activity over the
quantitative<00:01:51.440> easing<00:01:51.800> period<00:01:52.490> of<00:01:52.610> time<00:01:52.849> and

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
quantitative easing period of time and

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.870 
quantitative easing period of time and
so<00:01:53.780> in<00:01:54.289> the<00:01:54.590> in<00:01:54.860> the<00:01:54.890> post<00:01:55.190> period<00:01:55.640> it

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
so in the in the post period it

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.809 
so in the in the post period it
certainly<00:01:56.539> just<00:01:56.810> confirmed<00:01:57.319> that<00:01:57.590> that<00:01:58.280> logic

00:01:58.809 --> 00:01:58.819 
certainly just confirmed that that logic

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:01.449 
certainly just confirmed that that logic
was<00:01:59.030> indeed<00:01:59.390> well<00:01:59.690> placed<00:02:00.110> and<00:02:00.470> that<00:02:01.099> we're<00:02:01.280> in

00:02:01.449 --> 00:02:01.459 
was indeed well placed and that we're in

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:02.949 
was indeed well placed and that we're in
for<00:02:01.729> more<00:02:01.880> we<00:02:02.060> haven't<00:02:02.330> actually<00:02:02.539> started

00:02:02.949 --> 00:02:02.959 
for more we haven't actually started

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:04.779 
for more we haven't actually started
with<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.679> process<00:02:03.920> of<00:02:04.280> quantitative

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
with the process of quantitative

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:08.230 
with the process of quantitative
tightening<00:02:05.509> yet<00:02:05.780> or<00:02:06.619> even<00:02:07.099> tapering<00:02:07.670> that

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
tightening yet or even tapering that

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.719 
tightening yet or even tapering that
it's<00:02:08.450> imminent<00:02:08.959> and<00:02:09.289> a<00:02:10.009> lot<00:02:10.130> of<00:02:10.190> that<00:02:10.369> forward

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
it's imminent and a lot of that forward

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.380 
it's imminent and a lot of that forward
pricing<00:02:11.000> is<00:02:11.300> happening<00:02:11.870> at<00:02:12.020> the<00:02:12.470> moment<00:02:12.500> but

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
pricing is happening at the moment but

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.850 
pricing is happening at the moment but
that<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.660> logic<00:02:15.110> of<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.349> argument<00:02:15.380> is

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
that the logic of the argument is

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.860 
that the logic of the argument is
definitely<00:02:16.489> in<00:02:16.610> place<00:02:16.849> so<00:02:17.060> we<00:02:17.239> really<00:02:17.450> haven't

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
definitely in place so we really haven't

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.350 
definitely in place so we really haven't
seen<00:02:18.170> fit<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.560> change<00:02:19.040> our<00:02:19.250> outlook<00:02:19.640> at<00:02:19.760> all<00:02:19.880> do

things<00:04:33.570> have<00:04:33.840> really<00:04:34.050> you<00:04:34.620> know<00:04:34.740> broadsided

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
things have really you know broadsided

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:36.260 
things have really you know broadsided
what<00:04:35.640> I<00:04:35.669> believe<00:04:35.970> would

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
what I believe would

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.180 
what I believe would
otherwise<00:04:36.630> have<00:04:36.960> been<00:04:36.990> quite<00:04:37.410> a<00:04:37.440> robust<00:04:37.980> to

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
otherwise have been quite a robust to

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.860 
otherwise have been quite a robust to
increase<00:04:38.580> in<00:04:38.760> u.s.<00:04:39.060> consumer<00:04:39.540> spending

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
increase in u.s. consumer spending

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.080 
increase in u.s. consumer spending
having<00:04:40.440> said<00:04:40.680> that<00:04:40.710> it<00:04:41.130> is<00:04:41.400> rising<00:04:41.850> quite

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
having said that it is rising quite

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.030 
having said that it is rising quite
appreciably<00:04:42.540> at<00:04:42.840> the<00:04:42.960> moment<00:04:43.320> and<00:04:43.440> this<00:04:43.740> time

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
appreciably at the moment and this time

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.520 
appreciably at the moment and this time
it's<00:04:44.280> rising<00:04:44.550> sustainably<00:04:45.360> because<00:04:45.750> it's<00:04:46.230> not

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
it's rising sustainably because it's not

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.130 
it's rising sustainably because it's not
coming<00:04:47.010> at<00:04:47.190> the<00:04:47.340> expense<00:04:47.370> of<00:04:48.000> savings<00:04:48.540> savings

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
coming at the expense of savings savings

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
coming at the expense of savings savings
rates<00:04:49.590> are<00:04:49.770> still<00:04:50.300> remarkably<00:04:51.300> high<00:04:51.570> and

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
rates are still remarkably high and

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.380 
rates are still remarkably high and
consumers<00:04:53.160> are<00:04:53.310> picking<00:04:53.580> up<00:04:53.700> that<00:04:53.850> momentum

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.390 
consumers are picking up that momentum

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:55.910 
consumers are picking up that momentum
so<00:04:54.540> there's<00:04:54.750> seventy<00:04:55.200> percent<00:04:55.320> of<00:04:55.620> the<00:04:55.680> US

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
so there's seventy percent of the US

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.340 
so there's seventy percent of the US
economy<00:04:56.070> that's<00:04:56.790> actually<00:04:57.300> showing<00:04:57.570> a<00:04:57.930> really

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
economy that's actually showing a really

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.670 
economy that's actually showing a really
good<00:04:58.530> signs<00:04:58.860> of<00:04:59.430> increase<00:05:00.420> so<00:05:00.870> Peter<00:05:01.320> we<00:05:01.560> know

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
good signs of increase so Peter we know

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.190 
good signs of increase so Peter we know
your<00:05:01.860> thoughts<00:05:02.040> on<00:05:02.310> gold<00:05:02.610> but<00:05:02.820> come<00:05:03.090> 2014<00:05:04.020> do

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
your thoughts on gold but come 2014 do

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.810 
your thoughts on gold but come 2014 do
you<00:05:04.290> think<00:05:04.530> that<00:05:04.710> there<00:05:04.890> could<00:05:05.190> be<00:05:05.220> a<00:05:05.370> metal

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
you think that there could be a metal

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.660 
you think that there could be a metal
that<00:05:05.970> could<00:05:06.300> surprise<00:05:06.960> everyone<00:05:07.380> well<00:05:08.130> you

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:08.670 
that could surprise everyone well you

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.960 
that could surprise everyone well you
know<00:05:08.820> that<00:05:09.000> that's<00:05:09.390> a<00:05:09.510> great<00:05:09.840> question<00:05:10.110> to<00:05:10.410> ask

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
know that that's a great question to ask

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.430 
know that that's a great question to ask
normally<00:05:11.970> copper<00:05:12.540> would<00:05:12.750> be<00:05:12.870> one<00:05:13.050> of<00:05:13.170> those

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
normally copper would be one of those

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.160 
normally copper would be one of those
leading<00:05:14.430> indicators<00:05:15.030> of<00:05:15.180> world<00:05:15.420> economic

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
leading indication at this point

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.320 
leading indication at this point
unfortunately<00:05:26.220> we<00:05:26.370> believe<00:05:26.610> that<00:05:26.640> copper<00:05:27.210> has

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
unfortunately we believe that copper has

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.270 
unfortunately we believe that copper has
been<00:05:27.540> caught<00:05:27.810> up<00:05:27.840> in<00:05:28.230> the<00:05:28.350> Maelstrom<00:05:28.890> that<00:05:29.130> has

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
been caught up in the Maelstrom that has

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.240 
been caught up in the Maelstrom that has
affected<00:05:29.550> all<00:05:29.940> other<00:05:30.440> metals<00:05:31.440> and<00:05:31.800> that<00:05:32.040> is

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
affected all other metals and that is

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.030 
affected all other metals and that is
the<00:05:32.850> uncertainty<00:05:33.270> about<00:05:33.750> what<00:05:34.140> real<00:05:34.440> pricing

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.040 
the uncertainty about what real pricing

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.310 
the uncertainty about what real pricing
is<00:05:35.310> at<00:05:35.550> the<00:05:35.640> moment<00:05:36.030> with<00:05:36.210> with<00:05:36.810> the<00:05:36.960> amount<00:05:37.200> of

what<00:05:42.090> a<00:05:42.150> proper<00:05:42.780> landing<00:05:43.230> price<00:05:43.530> would<00:05:43.800> be<00:05:44.150> for

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
what a proper landing price would be for

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.150 
what a proper landing price would be for
any<00:05:45.390> base<00:05:45.630> metal<00:05:46.020> and<00:05:46.200> so<00:05:46.650> that's<00:05:46.800> the<00:05:47.010> one

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
any base metal and so that's the one

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.770 
any base metal and so that's the one
that<00:05:47.280> we<00:05:47.400> would<00:05:47.550> look<00:05:47.790> at<00:05:48.000> as<00:05:48.270> being<00:05:48.600> the

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
that we would look at as being the

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.840 
that we would look at as being the
bellwether<00:05:49.200> the<00:05:49.470> harbinger<00:05:50.100> of<00:05:50.130> a<00:05:50.370> true

we<00:05:53.790> sort<00:05:54.000> of<00:05:54.060> took<00:05:54.360> coppers<00:05:54.930> PhD<00:05:55.800> in<00:05:55.950> economics

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100

away from it temporarily because it just

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:00.860 
away from it temporarily because it just
you<00:05:59.460> know<00:05:59.550> it<00:05:59.700> doesn't<00:06:00.060> seem<00:06:00.210> to<00:06:00.270> have<00:06:00.600> that

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
doesn't mean that that won't resume but
