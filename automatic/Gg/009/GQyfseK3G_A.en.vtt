00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:25.800
 since the first announcements and indiscretions driver san fransisco has not received 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.159
 a particularly warm welcome from the public and the specialized press 

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:34.159
 and also to you from the hand, flight of ubisoft reflections has revealed several cues 

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:35.160
 interesting 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.700
 there is hope for a product that can at least partially surprise 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.700
 they are now disillusioned 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.630
 the one wanted by the developers is undoubtedly a return to the roots 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:47.720
 of sand 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.140
 fully strasse only from the first unforgettable chapter 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.430
 a title that plays everything in the street the worst criminal consequences of the 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.750
 homeland musical background contact to the bullit 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.370
 drifting trauma the other there is space even for some absurd traffic 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.439
 incomplete, but capable of not taking itself too seriously 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.430
 Stone wash house classification and original state dialogues are 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.400
 all the pieces in place in short with the addition of a mouse and 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.520
 technology 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.100
 in fact it is now known that the main peculiarity of the title is represented 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.460
 from the possibility of using a bird's eye view in real time 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.360
 on the city 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.990
 Instantly jump to the guide of any vehicle defined shit 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.450
 despite the justification at the plot level leaves to be desired the 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.740
 was really winning mechanics was 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.229
 as far as freedom to take over any vehicle I can suggest a 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:36.480
 word approach 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.540
 driver san fransisco rationalize it sofarsounds 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.270
 clearly differentiate the issue linked to history from secondary ones 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.729
 as many other grandmother titles said to unlock the first will be 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.729
 need to complete a number of second tasks 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.890
 outgoing chases not just anyway all that driver san fransisco has 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.050
 to offer to spideman fans here 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.060
 a certain emphasis was placed on the possibilities of character growth 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.899
 which are divided into automatics 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.200
 that is unlocked is simple progress with the chapters of the plot and 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.259
 customizable linked to a game time 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.879
 the latter can be accumulated by making street drives and completing them 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:17.109
 secondary missions can be put to use negrar where the player will have 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:20.169
 way to buy specific cars or in Florence for skills 

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:23.169
 special like your ramming people 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.640
 as far as the draft plot is concerned, even with all the unlockable mtvs processed 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:39.090
 will show general build nice background you must have the heart 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.889
 of the new battery driver for the streets of san fransisco hurtles in the middle of the 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:45.849
 traffic and exploit the flows thanks to the exit 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.829
 the main and secondary missions offer a fair variety of action 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:53.560
 whoever comes to the player now to throw himself I like this element now of Beijing 

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:54.609
 not suspicious 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:58.139
 but also of the assets used reads how to terrorize a teacher of 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:02:58.940
 driving school 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.379
 or destroy the advertising campaigns of a certain venue 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:05.959
 just like a more general thing, even the teeth of a horse between recovery 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.569
 of the roots of brenta and innovation 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.129
 on the one hand there is a good feeling of guiding Artemide Colombini sentences on the 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:14.189
 drift on the spectacular accident 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:17.359
 on the other hand the quote jump from one vehicle to another 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:20.839
 the result is a curious streaming link and strategy sent by 

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:23.539
 to master megaup the mountain amuses 

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:27.279
 certainly offer approaches tell me the guide to the foot mouse the highest 

00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:30.829
 ocse stands in which to implement strategic solutions on the never experienced 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:32.629
 thanks to the exit 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:36.840
 It is also said that they seek you total return to stereo from the caring guide 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.930
 of the first chapter 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.610
 will be disappointed as the new mechanics and is proposed as dominant 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:44.079
 within the crowd of ebay people 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.959
 the first hours of play I suggest longevity work 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.379
 between primary secondary dealership assignments to be purchased and stunts 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:51.430
 to complete 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.400
 the contents seem a masterpiece of reflections 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.660
 not counting the multiplayer component 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.660
 in which we will return to talking about images very soon 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:08.260
 from the technical point of view driver san fransisco manages to give a picture 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.549
 pleasant overall 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.739
 the city is with everyone if the brands are in view of credible traffic and one 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.249
 good general fluidity 

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:18.510
 the flip side of the coin consists of a finish of its own first 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:19.180
 level 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.120
 with some interpenetration movements begging cocks simulation of the 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.949
 physical times dancer 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:27.220
 a note of merit instead from the soundtrack 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.330
 curiosoni xd atmosfere the film of estimate achille and excellent traces on vicenza 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:35.770
 after turning on the aspect that driver san francisco hopes is confirmed in 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.540
 this last test before release 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.090
 as a product full of interesting ideas 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.610
 the guys from ubisoft reflections have bet everything on the mechanics that if 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.430
 on the one hand, on the one hand the architecture guide component on the other proposes a 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.680
 approach i really feel in pursuit 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.580
 if we add to this the good level contextualization not 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.340
 all that remains is to wait confident of the product.
