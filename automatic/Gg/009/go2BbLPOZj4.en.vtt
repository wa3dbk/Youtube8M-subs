00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:03.619 

triangular<00:00:02.220> numbers<00:00:02.610> are<00:00:02.850> another<00:00:03.240> type<00:00:03.570> of

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
triangular numbers are another type of

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.070 
triangular numbers are another type of
special<00:00:04.500> number<00:00:05.250> pattern<00:00:05.580> you<00:00:06.540> can<00:00:06.690> see<00:00:06.870> from

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
special number pattern you can see from

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.190 
special number pattern you can see from
the<00:00:07.170> diagram<00:00:07.350> below<00:00:07.770> that<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:09.420> numbers<00:00:09.840> can

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
the diagram below that the numbers can

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.999 
the diagram below that the numbers can
be<00:00:10.280> formed<00:00:11.280> in<00:00:11.519> two<00:00:11.759> triangular<00:00:12.330> shapes<00:00:13.009> so

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
be formed in two triangular shapes so

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.210 
be formed in two triangular shapes so
you<00:00:14.070> can<00:00:14.280> see<00:00:14.519> here<00:00:14.880> number<00:00:15.420> one<00:00:15.750> has

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:16.220 
you can see here number one has

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:21.620 
you can see here number one has
obviously<00:00:17.220> just<00:00:17.609> one<00:00:17.850> that's<00:00:18.570> pad<00:00:18.859> 3<00:00:20.150> has<00:00:21.150> one

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
obviously just one that's pad 3 has one

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.980 
obviously just one that's pad 3 has one
at<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.840> top<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.350> then<00:00:23.340> two<00:00:24.300> on<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.750> next

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
at the top and then two on the next

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.060 
at the top and then two on the next
level<00:00:25.320> down<00:00:26.090> six<00:00:27.260> starts<00:00:28.260> we<00:00:28.410> want<00:00:28.680> at<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.800> top

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
level down six starts we want at the top

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.650 
level down six starts we want at the top
so<00:00:29.460> we're<00:00:29.609> always<00:00:29.789> starting<00:00:30.210> with<00:00:30.300> one<00:00:30.480> at<00:00:30.599> the

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
so we're always starting with one at the

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.610 
so we're always starting with one at the
top<00:00:30.900> our<00:00:31.140> next<00:00:31.980> row<00:00:32.189> has<00:00:32.489> two<00:00:32.820> in<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.620> our

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
top our next row has two in it and our

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.830 
top our next row has two in it and our
next<00:00:35.100> row<00:00:35.250> has<00:00:35.520> an<00:00:35.640> extra<00:00:35.969> one<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.149> three<00:00:36.809> in<00:00:36.960> it

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
next row has an extra one so three in it

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.420 
next row has an extra one so three in it
our<00:00:39.840> next<00:00:40.260> triangular<00:00:40.680> number<00:00:40.980> again

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
our next triangular number again

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.459 
our next triangular number again
starting<00:00:42.120> with<00:00:42.149> one<00:00:42.980> next<00:00:43.980> row<00:00:44.129> down<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:45.469> 2x3

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
starting with one next row down is 2x3

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.340 
starting with one next row down is 2x3
down<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:47.070> 3<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.809> the<00:00:48.809> next<00:00:49.079> row<00:00:49.230> down<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.890> four

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
down is 3 and the next row down is four

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.810 
down is 3 and the next row down is four
so<00:00:52.350> let's<00:00:52.379> have<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.770> look<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.010> closer<00:00:53.399> look<00:00:53.640> at

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
so let's have a look a closer look at

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.900 
so let's have a look a closer look at
how<00:00:54.000> this<00:00:54.390> number<00:00:54.960> pattern<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.530> formed<00:00:55.920> we<00:00:56.789> are

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
how this number pattern is formed we are

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.569 
how this number pattern is formed we are
always<00:00:57.090> starting<00:00:57.539> with<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.530> number<00:00:58.680> 1<00:01:01.460> to<00:01:02.460> get

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
always starting with the number 1 to get

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.479 
always starting with the number 1 to get
our<00:01:02.699> next<00:01:02.910> triangular<00:01:03.539> number<00:01:03.870> we<00:01:04.470> add<00:01:04.650> 2<00:01:05.250> to

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
our next triangular number we add 2 to

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.170 
our next triangular number we add 2 to
that<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:06.210> we<00:01:06.330> had<00:01:06.540> one<00:01:06.780> we're<00:01:07.470> adding<00:01:07.830> 2<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.369> we

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
that so we had one we're adding 2 and we

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.920 
that so we had one we're adding 2 and we
get<00:01:09.390> 3<00:01:10.200> as<00:01:10.380> I'll<00:01:10.890> try<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.250> do<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.369> number<00:01:11.780> to<00:01:12.780> get

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
get 3 as I'll try and do a number to get

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.100 
get 3 as I'll try and do a number to get
the<00:01:13.049> next<00:01:13.260> one<00:01:13.500> we<00:01:14.340> start<00:01:14.729> with<00:01:15.540> our<00:01:15.750> previous

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
the next one we start with our previous

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.550 
the next one we start with our previous
training<00:01:16.650> Euler<00:01:16.860> number<00:01:17.180> add<00:01:19.610> 3<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:20.790> time

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
training Euler number add 3 this time

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.380 
training Euler number add 3 this time
and<00:01:22.560> we<00:01:22.770> get<00:01:22.950> 6<00:01:24.200> to<00:01:25.200> our<00:01:25.320> next<00:01:25.650> one<00:01:26.060> we<00:01:27.060> start

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
and we get 6 to our next one we start

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.539 
and we get 6 to our next one we start
with<00:01:27.630> 6<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.259> previous<00:01:28.680> triangular<00:01:29.220> number

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
with 6 the previous triangular number

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.920 
with 6 the previous triangular number
this<00:01:30.150> time<00:01:30.210> we're<00:01:30.570> going<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.869> add<00:01:31.430> 4<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.930> we'll

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
this time we're going to add 4 and we'll

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.240 
this time we're going to add 4 and we'll
get<00:01:34.140> 10<00:01:35.009> as<00:01:35.220> now<00:01:35.610> next<00:01:35.850> triangular<00:01:36.299> number<00:01:37.250> so

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
get 10 as now next triangular number so

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.920 
get 10 as now next triangular number so
to<00:01:38.310> get<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.670> next<00:01:38.909> train<00:01:39.119> Euler<00:01:39.479> number<00:01:39.780> which

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
to get the next train Euler number which

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.929 
to get the next train Euler number which
we<00:01:40.079> don't<00:01:40.259> have<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.409> diagram<00:01:40.799> for<00:01:41.100> here<00:01:41.400> we

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
we don't have a diagram for here we

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.929 
we don't have a diagram for here we
would<00:01:42.090> start<00:01:42.390> with<00:01:42.450> 10<00:01:43.100> this<00:01:44.100> time<00:01:44.399> we<00:01:44.820> would

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
would start with 10 this time we would

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.370 
would start with 10 this time we would
add<00:01:45.149> 5<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.700> so<00:01:47.700> our<00:01:47.939> resulting<00:01:48.659> number<00:01:49.200> would

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
add 5 and so our resulting number would

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.660 
add 5 and so our resulting number would
be<00:01:49.439> 15<00:01:50.780> we'll<00:01:51.780> go<00:01:51.899> one<00:01:52.079> more<00:01:52.140> time<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:53.220> starting

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
be 15 we'll go one more time so starting

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.459 
be 15 we'll go one more time so starting
with<00:01:53.790> 15<00:01:54.409> next<00:01:55.409> time<00:01:55.710> we<00:01:55.860> would<00:01:56.009> add<00:01:56.189> 6<00:01:57.229> so<00:01:58.229> a

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
with 15 next time we would add 6 so a

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.539 
with 15 next time we would add 6 so a
resulting<00:01:59.189> triangular<00:01:59.759> number<00:02:00.090> be<00:02:00.540> 21<00:02:01.520> so<00:02:02.520> we

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
resulting triangular number be 21 so we

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.760 
resulting triangular number be 21 so we
have<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:02.939> closer<00:02:03.299> closer<00:02:03.930> look<00:02:04.259> at<00:02:04.409> what<00:02:04.560> we're

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
have a closer closer look at what we're

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.859 
have a closer closer look at what we're
doing<00:02:05.219> here<00:02:06.439> each<00:02:07.439> time<00:02:07.829> we're<00:02:08.520> adding<00:02:08.729> 1<00:02:09.629> more

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
doing here each time we're adding 1 more

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.260 
doing here each time we're adding 1 more
than<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.110> previous<00:02:10.619> time<00:02:10.800> so<00:02:11.459> first<00:02:11.670> we<00:02:11.940> added

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
than the previous time so first we added

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.430 
than the previous time so first we added
2

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
2

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.950 
2
then<00:02:14.040> we<00:02:14.220> added<00:02:14.430> three<00:02:15.500> then<00:02:16.500> we<00:02:16.530> added<00:02:16.830> four

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
then we added three then we added four

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.400 
then we added three then we added four
added<00:02:18.960> five<00:02:19.700> added<00:02:20.700> six<00:02:21.060> next<00:02:22.050> time<00:02:22.170> we<00:02:22.290> would

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
added five added six next time we would

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
added five added six next time we would
add<00:02:22.560> seven<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:23.790> eight<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:24.540> so<00:02:24.930> on<00:02:25.220> so<00:02:26.220> our

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
add seven and eight and so on so our

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.820 
add seven and eight and so on so our
triangular<00:02:27.030> numbers<00:02:27.570> are<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:28.230> numbers<00:02:28.260> that

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
triangular numbers are the numbers that

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.570 
triangular numbers are the numbers that
are<00:02:28.980> formed<00:02:29.520> from<00:02:30.480> that<00:02:31.110> pattern<00:02:31.470> so<00:02:31.710> starting

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
are formed from that pattern so starting

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:42.860 
are formed from that pattern so starting
with<00:02:32.730> 1<00:02:32.970> 3<00:02:34.730> 6<00:02:36.830> 10<00:02:38.120> 15<00:02:39.860> 21
