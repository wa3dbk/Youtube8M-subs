00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
year but looking back at it I feel like

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.240 
year but looking back at it I feel like
that<00:00:51.360> was<00:00:51.480> kind<00:00:51.720> of<00:00:51.809> pointless<00:00:52.199> cuz<00:00:52.590> all<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:52.890> had

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
that was kind of pointless cuz all I had

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.210 
that was kind of pointless cuz all I had
was<00:00:54.149> my<00:00:54.570> completely<00:00:55.230> organized<00:00:55.710> binder

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.220 
was my completely organized binder

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.860 
was my completely organized binder
everything<00:00:56.670> was<00:00:56.790> perfectly<00:00:57.360> neat

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
everything was perfectly neat

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.380 
everything was perfectly neat
there<00:00:58.260> was<00:00:58.380> nothing<00:00:59.030> interesting<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.059> find

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
there was nothing interesting to find

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.219 
there was nothing interesting to find
nothing<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.470> actually<00:01:01.800> use<00:01:02.489> so<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.630> decided<00:01:04.050> that

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
nothing I actually use so I decided that

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.609 
nothing I actually use so I decided that
I<00:01:04.619> would<00:01:04.680> redo<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.430> for<00:01:05.850> this<00:01:06.330> semester<00:01:06.930> it's

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
I would redo it for this semester it's

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.190 
I would redo it for this semester it's
actually<00:01:07.920> kind<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.220> ironic<00:01:08.369> it's<00:01:09.030> Monday<00:01:09.630> the

point<00:01:24.300> 8<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.930> I'm<00:01:25.619> not<00:01:25.770> gonna<00:01:25.979> say<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.220> was

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
point 8 and I'm not gonna say it was

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.910 
point 8 and I'm not gonna say it was
cheap<00:01:26.729> because<00:01:27.119> for<00:01:28.049> me<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.350> took<00:01:28.530> money<00:01:28.830> out

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
cheap because for me it took money out

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.219 
cheap because for me it took money out
of<00:01:29.070> my<00:01:29.369> bank<00:01:29.520> account<00:01:29.940> it<00:01:30.510> was<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.720> hundred<00:01:31.110> and

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
of my bank account it was a hundred and

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.260 
of my bank account it was a hundred and
twenty-five<00:01:31.530> dollars<00:01:31.710> which<00:01:32.490> was<00:01:32.790> kind<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.180> a

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
twenty-five dollars which was kind of a

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.990 
twenty-five dollars which was kind of a
lot<00:01:33.450> for<00:01:33.690> me<00:01:33.869> but<00:01:34.650> that's<00:01:35.340> really<00:01:35.729> really

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
lot for me but that's really really

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.640 
lot for me but that's really really
cheap<00:01:36.270> for<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.570> lens<00:01:36.810> I'm<00:01:37.080> pretty<00:01:37.260> sure<00:01:37.500> it's

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
cheap for a lens I'm pretty sure it's

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.450 
cheap for a lens I'm pretty sure it's
like<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.040> cheapest<00:01:38.490> lens<00:01:38.900> Canon<00:01:39.900> sells<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.799> I

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
like the cheapest lens Canon sells and I

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.179 
like the cheapest lens Canon sells and I
do<00:01:41.909> drop<00:01:42.360> my<00:01:42.510> camera<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.930> little<00:01:43.260> far<00:01:43.560> away<00:01:43.890> in

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
do drop my camera a little far away in

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.280 
do drop my camera a little far away in
order<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.520> fit<00:01:44.850> in<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.270> because<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.930> stays

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
order to fit in it because it stays

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.800 
order to fit in it because it stays
zoomed<00:01:46.740> but<00:01:47.400> other<00:01:47.700> than<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.090> really<00:01:48.600> like

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
zoomed but other than that I really like

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.929 
zoomed but other than that I really like
it<00:01:49.049> I<00:01:49.140> think<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.530> gives<00:01:49.650> it<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.979> really<00:01:50.310> high

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
it I think it gives it a really high

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.670 
it I think it gives it a really high
quality<00:01:51.110> nice<00:01:52.110> looking<00:01:52.740> effect<00:01:53.369> so<00:01:54.330> yeah<00:01:55.049> not

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
quality nice looking effect so yeah not

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.200 
quality nice looking effect so yeah not
all<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.040> my<00:01:56.159> videos<00:01:56.490> will<00:01:56.729> be<00:01:56.759> filmed<00:01:57.150> with

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
all of my videos will be filmed with

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.179 
all of my videos will be filmed with
this<00:01:57.479> because<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:57.869> am<00:01:58.080> using<00:01:58.350> this<00:01:58.590> for<00:01:58.830> picture

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
this because I am using this for picture

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.030 
this because I am using this for picture
taking<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.640> lot<00:01:59.850> but<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.689> figured<00:02:01.080> for<00:02:01.439> this<00:02:01.799> one

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
taking a lot but I figured for this one

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.710 
taking a lot but I figured for this one
since<00:02:02.369> I'm<00:02:02.490> just<00:02:02.520> sitting<00:02:03.000> here<00:02:03.030> it'll<00:02:03.600> be

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
since I'm just sitting here it'll be

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.490 
since I'm just sitting here it'll be
fine

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
fine

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.679 
fine
this<00:02:04.979> thing<00:02:05.220> picks<00:02:05.430> up<00:02:05.670> so<00:02:05.909> much<00:02:06.090> light<00:02:06.390> so

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
this thing picks up so much light so

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.600 
this thing picks up so much light so
easily<00:02:06.960> like<00:02:07.350> I'm<00:02:07.470> not<00:02:07.619> even<00:02:07.860> using<00:02:08.040> a<00:02:08.190> single

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
easily like I'm not even using a single

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.969 
easily like I'm not even using a single
studio<00:02:08.940> light<00:02:09.239> right<00:02:09.450> now<00:02:09.679> and<00:02:10.679> you're<00:02:10.860> just

out too much information then you would
see<00:02:35.160> this<00:02:35.310> math<00:02:35.700> notebook<00:02:36.390> just<00:02:36.780> full<00:02:37.710> of<00:02:37.740> a

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
see this math notebook just full of a

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.880 
see this math notebook just full of a
bunch<00:02:38.160> of<00:02:38.400> like<00:02:38.730> math<00:02:39.060> notes<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:40.020> concepts

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
bunch of like math notes and concepts

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.550 
bunch of like math notes and concepts
and<00:02:41.390> stuff<00:02:42.390> that<00:02:42.660> you<00:02:42.750> probably<00:02:42.930> can't<00:02:43.350> see

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
and stuff that you probably can't see

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.400 
and stuff that you probably can't see
very<00:02:43.740> well<00:02:43.890> right<00:02:44.250> now<00:02:44.430> but<00:02:45.330> honestly<00:02:45.990> I<00:02:46.080> kind

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
very well right now but honestly I kind

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.320 
very well right now but honestly I kind
of<00:02:46.470> just<00:02:46.680> use<00:02:46.830> this<00:02:46.980> as<00:02:47.190> scratch<00:02:47.490> paper<00:02:47.850> so

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
of just use this as scratch paper so

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.450 
of just use this as scratch paper so
I'll<00:02:48.420> take<00:02:48.660> it<00:02:48.810> out<00:02:48.930> in<00:02:49.200> other<00:02:49.680> classes<00:02:50.070> when<00:02:50.430> I

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
I'll take it out in other classes when I

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.490 
I'll take it out in other classes when I
need<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:50.850> write<00:02:51.030> a<00:02:51.060> note<00:02:51.390> or<00:02:51.690> put<00:02:52.290> something

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
need to write a note or put something

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.740 
need to write a note or put something
down<00:02:52.830> I<00:02:52.860> don't<00:02:53.100> have<00:02:53.430> any<00:02:53.760> loose<00:02:54.450> leaf<00:02:54.720> paper

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
down I don't have any loose leaf paper

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.560 
down I don't have any loose leaf paper
then<00:02:55.680> I<00:02:55.710> have<00:02:56.010> this<00:02:56.310> random<00:02:56.700> green<00:02:57.180> folder

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
then I have this random green folder

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.920 
then I have this random green folder
which<00:02:57.900> I<00:02:58.020> kind<00:02:58.560> of<00:02:58.970> kind<00:02:59.970> of<00:03:00.150> I<00:03:00.300> lightly<00:03:00.570> say

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
which I kind of kind of I lightly say

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.930 
which I kind of kind of I lightly say
kind<00:03:01.200> of<00:03:01.320> use<00:03:01.500> for<00:03:01.710> journalism<00:03:02.190> I<00:03:02.550> just<00:03:02.790> have

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
kind of use for journalism I just have

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.170 
kind of use for journalism I just have
like<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.300> last<00:03:03.540> two<00:03:04.340> newspapers<00:03:05.340> stuffed<00:03:05.910> in

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
like the last two newspapers stuffed in

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.530 
like the last two newspapers stuffed in
here<00:03:07.070> cuz<00:03:08.070> I<00:03:08.100> kept<00:03:08.490> them<00:03:08.760> but<00:03:09.000> I<00:03:09.030> never<00:03:09.270> did

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
here cuz I kept them but I never did

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.530 
here cuz I kept them but I never did
anything<00:03:09.780> with<00:03:10.140> them<00:03:10.170> then<00:03:10.950> I<00:03:11.370> have<00:03:11.640> my<00:03:11.970> social

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
anything with them then I have my social

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.720 
anything with them then I have my social
studies<00:03:12.720> by<00:03:13.110> here<00:03:13.470> which<00:03:13.950> we<00:03:14.220> have<00:03:14.250> to

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
studies by here which we have to

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.770 
studies by here which we have to
organize<00:03:15.060> like<00:03:15.990> every<00:03:16.770> other<00:03:17.040> week<00:03:17.730> so<00:03:18.300> I'm

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
organize like every other week so I'm

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.900 
organize like every other week so I'm
pretty<00:03:19.290> sure<00:03:19.560> she<00:03:19.800> said<00:03:19.830> it<00:03:20.070> was<00:03:20.190> extra<00:03:20.580> credit

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
pretty sure she said it was extra credit

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.030 
pretty sure she said it was extra credit
this<00:03:21.120> is<00:03:21.300> really<00:03:21.600> awkward<00:03:21.750> if<00:03:22.080> it<00:03:22.230> wasn't<00:03:22.590> but

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
this is really awkward if it wasn't but

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.370 
this is really awkward if it wasn't but
we<00:03:23.190> could<00:03:23.400> organize<00:03:23.700> this<00:03:24.210> over<00:03:24.750> break<00:03:25.050> and

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
we could organize this over break and

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.620 
we could organize this over break and
like<00:03:25.500> a<00:03:25.560> bring<00:03:25.860> it<00:03:25.890> back<00:03:26.190> so<00:03:26.460> I<00:03:26.910> might<00:03:27.330> do<00:03:27.600> that

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
like a bring it back so I might do that

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.530 
like a bring it back so I might do that
tonight<00:03:28.050> but<00:03:28.770> like<00:03:29.280> my<00:03:29.550> grade<00:03:29.880> is<00:03:30.060> usually

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
tonight but like my grade is usually

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.010 
tonight but like my grade is usually
pretty<00:03:30.810> good<00:03:30.930> in<00:03:31.260> that<00:03:31.290> class<00:03:31.920> so<00:03:32.610> then<00:03:33.510> I<00:03:33.540> got

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
pretty good in that class so then I got

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.520 
pretty good in that class so then I got
my<00:03:34.230> science<00:03:34.560> book<00:03:35.100> just<00:03:35.700> says<00:03:36.230> Malakai<00:03:37.230> walks

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
my science book just says Malakai walks

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.880 
my science book just says Malakai walks
in<00:03:37.830> ace<00:03:38.130> hour<00:03:38.490> and<00:03:39.060> it's<00:03:39.750> just<00:03:40.050> my<00:03:40.320> advanced

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
in ace hour and it's just my advanced

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
in ace hour and it's just my advanced
science<00:03:41.520> book

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
science book

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.310 
science book
I<00:03:41.940> forgot<00:03:42.510> all<00:03:42.780> a<00:03:42.840> book<00:03:43.200> I<00:03:44.660> always<00:03:45.660> say<00:03:46.050> I'm<00:03:46.200> in

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
I forgot all a book I always say I'm in

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.960 
I forgot all a book I always say I'm in
advanced<00:03:46.680> science<00:03:47.160> but<00:03:47.340> I'm<00:03:47.430> looking<00:03:47.760> proud

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
advanced science but I'm looking proud

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.240 
advanced science but I'm looking proud
of<00:03:48.120> it<00:03:48.240> so<00:03:48.450> yeah<00:03:48.660> here's<00:03:48.960> my<00:03:49.050> advanced<00:03:49.620> science

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
of it so yeah here's my advanced science

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.410 
of it so yeah here's my advanced science
folder<00:03:50.810> look<00:03:51.810> what<00:03:52.470> so<00:03:53.010> we<00:03:53.190> hardly<00:03:53.520> ever<00:03:53.640> use

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
folder look what so we hardly ever use

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.300 
folder look what so we hardly ever use
this<00:03:54.660> like<00:03:54.960> really<00:03:55.380> the<00:03:55.500> only<00:03:55.650> thing<00:03:55.920> we<00:03:55.950> use

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
this like really the only thing we use

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.350 
this like really the only thing we use
is<00:03:56.610> the<00:03:57.330> periodic<00:03:57.960> table<00:03:58.500> or<00:03:58.710> the<00:03:58.890> page<00:03:59.360> 232

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
is the periodic table or the page 232

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.720 
is the periodic table or the page 232
but<00:04:01.140> other<00:04:01.320> than<00:04:01.560> that<00:04:01.620> we<00:04:01.950> hardly<00:04:02.190> ever<00:04:02.340> touch

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
but other than that we hardly ever touch

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.030 
but other than that we hardly ever touch
it<00:04:02.760> so<00:04:03.330> and<00:04:03.900> then<00:04:03.930> the<00:04:04.290> last<00:04:04.410> thing<00:04:04.860> that<00:04:04.890> I

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
it so and then the last thing that I

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.250 
it so and then the last thing that I
have<00:04:05.130> in<00:04:05.580> this<00:04:05.850> big<00:04:06.120> pouch<00:04:06.390> that<00:04:06.720> is<00:04:06.840> outside

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
have in this big pouch that is outside

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.800 
have in this big pouch that is outside
of<00:04:07.320> my<00:04:07.530> binder<00:04:07.950> is<00:04:08.130> my<00:04:08.850> nook<00:04:09.180> which<00:04:09.630> is

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
of my binder is my nook which is

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.160 
of my binder is my nook which is
actually<00:04:10.410> broken<00:04:10.980> so<00:04:11.390> I'm<00:04:12.390> pretty<00:04:12.840> sure<00:04:13.020> my

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170
