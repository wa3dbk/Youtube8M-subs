most of elements other cases use four

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.920 
most of elements other cases use four
screws<00:02:31.800> while<00:02:32.370> this<00:02:32.550> one<00:02:32.730> has<00:02:32.760> several<00:02:33.510> screws

case reason being the whole thing is

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.680 
case reason being the whole thing is
hinged<00:02:41.280> as<00:02:41.400> you<00:02:41.520> can<00:02:41.670> see<00:02:41.880> kind<00:02:42.510> of<00:02:42.569> like<00:02:42.660> a

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.020 
hinged as you can see kind of like a
watch<00:02:42.989> band<00:02:43.319> so<00:02:43.530> once<00:02:43.920> you<00:02:44.040> remove<00:02:44.160> one<00:02:44.580> the

watch band so once you remove one the
whole<00:02:45.209> thing<00:02:45.420> kind<00:02:45.600> of<00:02:45.750> collapses<00:02:46.260> apart<00:02:46.590> so

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
whole thing kind of collapses apart so

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.470 
whole thing kind of collapses apart so
I'm<00:02:47.280> going<00:02:47.519> to<00:02:47.550> remove<00:02:47.820> the<00:02:48.030> screw<00:02:48.269> right<00:02:48.420> here

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
I'm going to remove the screw right here

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.570 
I'm going to remove the screw right here
and<00:02:48.840> show<00:02:48.989> you<00:02:49.050> exactly<00:02:49.260> what<00:02:49.739> I<00:02:49.769> mean<00:02:49.860> the

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
tool works just fine I do find that

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.320 
tool works just fine I do find that
these<00:02:53.400> screws<00:02:53.670> come<00:02:53.910> out<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:54.060> little<00:02:54.180> bit

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
these screws come out a little bit

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.470 
these screws come out a little bit
easier<00:02:54.570> than<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.890> iPhone<00:02:56.400> 4<00:02:56.760> version<00:02:57.209> that<00:02:57.390> I

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
ready to put the screw back in I'm just

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.650 
ready to put the screw back in I'm just
holding<00:03:26.400> it<00:03:26.459> together<00:03:26.730> real<00:03:26.970> tight<00:03:27.209> so<00:03:27.420> I<00:03:27.480> can

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
holding it together real tight so I can

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.569 
holding it together real tight so I can
do<00:03:27.750> that<00:03:27.959> so<00:03:28.440> I'm<00:03:28.650> gonna<00:03:28.769> try<00:03:28.980> to<00:03:29.040> do<00:03:29.220> this<00:03:29.370> on

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
do that so I'm gonna try to do this on

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.910 
do that so I'm gonna try to do this on
camera<00:03:29.610> if<00:03:30.150> I<00:03:30.239> can<00:03:30.540> I'm<00:03:31.140> gonna<00:03:31.260> grab<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:31.680> tool

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
camera if I can I'm gonna grab the tool

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.580 
camera if I can I'm gonna grab the tool
and<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.430> screw<00:03:32.790> and<00:03:33.170> screw<00:03:34.170> it<00:03:34.290> back<00:03:34.410> together

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
and the screw and screw it back together

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.949 
and the screw and screw it back together
so<00:03:34.980> it's<00:03:35.640> really<00:03:35.880> nice<00:03:36.060> that<00:03:36.090> they<00:03:36.570> you<00:03:36.930> know

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
so it's really nice that they you know

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.319 
so it's really nice that they you know
made<00:03:37.290> this<00:03:37.530> design<00:03:37.890> so<00:03:37.920> that<00:03:38.220> you<00:03:38.850> only<00:03:39.030> have

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
made this design so that you only have

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.660 
made this design so that you only have
to<00:03:39.540> put<00:03:39.900> one<00:03:40.170> screw<00:03:40.590> in<00:03:40.620> as<00:03:41.160> opposed<00:03:41.549> to

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
to put one screw in as opposed to

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.330 
to put one screw in as opposed to
putting<00:03:42.570> 4<00:03:42.989> in<00:03:43.230> it<00:03:43.260> just<00:03:43.560> makes<00:03:43.829> it<00:03:43.920> all<00:03:44.070> that

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
putting 4 in it just makes it all that

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.430 
putting 4 in it just makes it all that
much<00:03:44.519> easier<00:03:47.690> so<00:03:48.690> once<00:03:48.870> you<00:03:48.989> get<00:03:49.079> the<00:03:49.230> holes

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
much easier so once you get the holes

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.530 
much easier so once you get the holes
all<00:03:49.680> lined<00:03:49.980> up<00:03:50.250> just<00:03:50.280> tuck<00:03:50.790> the<00:03:50.940> screw<00:03:51.180> inside

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
all lined up just tuck the screw inside

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.330 
all lined up just tuck the screw inside
and<00:03:51.870> screw<00:03:52.290> it<00:03:52.410> in<00:03:52.560> just<00:03:52.890> like<00:03:53.010> you<00:03:53.160> would<00:03:53.310> any

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
and screw it in just like you would any

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.310 
and screw it in just like you would any
of<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:53.850> other<00:03:54.030> element<00:03:54.570> cases<00:03:55.019> and<00:03:55.260> that's

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
of the other element cases and that's

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.140 
of the other element cases and that's
what<00:03:55.530> I'm<00:03:55.620> doing<00:03:55.859> right<00:03:55.890> now<00:03:56.070> a<00:03:56.430> little<00:03:57.030> bit

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
what I'm doing right now a little bit

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.880 
what I'm doing right now a little bit
hard<00:03:57.329> for<00:03:57.480> me<00:03:57.540> to<00:03:57.660> do<00:03:57.750> on<00:03:57.900> camera<00:03:58.230> but<00:03:58.590> I<00:03:58.680> should

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
hard for me to do on camera but I should

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.860 
hard for me to do on camera but I should
have<00:03:59.070> it<00:03:59.190> in<00:03:59.310> there<00:03:59.489> lickety-split<00:04:00.000> like<00:04:00.600> so

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
have it in there lickety-split like so

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.319 
have it in there lickety-split like so
of<00:04:01.140> course<00:04:01.769> with<00:04:02.070> any<00:04:02.280> of<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.519> element<00:04:02.880> cases

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
of course with any of the element cases

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.539 
of course with any of the element cases
you<00:04:03.510> do<00:04:03.660> not<00:04:03.810> want<00:04:04.109> to<00:04:04.200> over<00:04:04.410> tighten<00:04:04.440> this<00:04:04.920> for
