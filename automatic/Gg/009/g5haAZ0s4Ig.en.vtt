00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.910
 to make the mask we are going to 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.160
 catch a group 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.970
 and we will go 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.970
 container 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.500
 next let's take two 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.660
 spoonfuls of honey I in this case I'm going to 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.380
 take two tablespoons of honey because 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.100
 I have longer hair but if I 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.960
 you have short 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.960
 then you take a spoonful 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.630
 now let's put 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.460
 three tablespoons of oil 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.430
 if you have short hair and you have thrown 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:11.100
 only a spoonful of honey you're going to 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.630
 Take two tablespoons of oil 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:18.990
 to use a wooden spatula since 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.930
 the properties of oil honey and 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.020
 of the egg if we move with a spatula of 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.600
 metal, however, it is removed 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.299
 the wood stays 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.950
 we are going to stir until there is one 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.020
 completely homogeneous mixture 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.350
 let's move on to apply the in the 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.350
 hair 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.300
 well now let's move on to apply the 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.550
 mixture 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.909
 for this we are going to need a comb 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:53.860
 and a towel to avoid staining 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.370
 to place by the shoulders 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.370
 but 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.950
 and make sure we have the hair 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:08.229
 properly brushed before 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.260
 apply us 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.530
 mask to be able to apply it for everything 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.530
 The hair 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.130
 place again 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.480
 well 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.370
 ear 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.370
 from here down we are going to place 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.790
 It is important that you apply for everything 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.810
 the hair that we have done for this 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.810
 pretty face mask 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.650
 the section that we 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.650
 so you can see well 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.540
 and we apply again 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.800
 we catch it remember that we caught right 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.000
 we will make sure that 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.000
 full 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.500
 priced 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:31.750
 Once you have all the hair 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:34.630
 completely filled with the mask 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:39.240
 make sure you're living everything and 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.240
 if not, a little lame is not 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.240
 I have already removed my mask and 

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:52.440
 As you can see, this would be the 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.440
 hair after using it 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:05:01.300
 it appreciates enough brightness 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.300
 I noticed it a lot more hydrated 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.270
 remember that the mask is for 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.770
 when you have damaged hair or what 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:13.520
 you notice drier than normal 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:19.009
 I usually do it once a month 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:23.180
 to break open they open up a lot and 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:26.259
 it helps a lot to take care of them a little and that 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.259
 do not spoil so much 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:38.479
