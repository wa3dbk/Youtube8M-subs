Duty that has been made to this date and

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.470 
Duty that has been made to this date and
I<00:00:55.160> base<00:00:56.160> this<00:00:56.190> on<00:00:56.960> the<00:00:57.960> fact<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.320> there<00:00:58.739> are

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.970 
I base this on the fact that there are
there<00:01:00.480> are<00:01:00.510> no<00:01:00.600> exploits<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.350> can<00:01:01.620> find

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
there are no exploits that I can find

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.750

going ahead and checking it out first
before<00:02:20.099> you<00:02:20.790> before<00:02:21.420> you<00:02:21.569> go<00:02:21.720> like<00:02:21.930> by<00:02:22.110> maps
