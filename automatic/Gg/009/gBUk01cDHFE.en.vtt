00:04:32.309 --> 00:04:32.319 
going to put a pinch right now so here

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:32.760 
going to put a pinch right now so here
we<00:04:32.379> go

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
we go

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.749 
we go
this<00:04:33.099> is<00:04:33.280> the<00:04:33.340> key<00:04:33.460> to<00:04:33.490> the<00:04:33.759> drumroll<00:04:35.580> so<00:04:36.580> this

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:36.759 
this is the key to the drumroll so this

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:38.689 
this is the key to the drumroll so this
is<00:04:36.879> where<00:04:37.030> I<00:04:37.060> think<00:04:37.150> that<00:04:37.419> a<00:04:37.479> lot<00:04:37.659> of<00:04:37.780> people

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
is where I think that a lot of people

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:41.640 
is where I think that a lot of people
don't<00:04:39.699> take<00:04:39.909> hummus<00:04:40.270> to<00:04:40.449> the<00:04:40.569> next<00:04:41.229> level

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
don't take hummus to the next level

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.920 
don't take hummus to the next level
which<00:04:41.919> is<00:04:41.949> you<00:04:42.729> want<00:04:42.940> to<00:04:43.030> process<00:04:43.270> this<00:04:43.720> until

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
which is you want to process this until

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.350 
which is you want to process this until
it<00:04:44.259> really<00:04:44.500> becomes<00:04:44.889> nice<00:04:45.129> and<00:04:45.340> creamy<00:04:45.729> and<00:04:46.000> it

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
it really becomes nice and creamy and it

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.469 
it really becomes nice and creamy and it
starts<00:04:46.629> to<00:04:46.690> become<00:04:46.780> not<00:04:47.110> a<00:04:47.139> puree<00:04:47.819> but<00:04:48.819> it<00:04:49.090> gets
