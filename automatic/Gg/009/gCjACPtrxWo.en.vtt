 mostly covered will rebuild what 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.239
 is the tip to the will help us is going to 

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:44.920
 facilitate the ironing that nowadays 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.059
 we use a lot of plates and one of 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.920
 the problems that we have is that not 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.629
 we use thermal protector is 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.489
 thermal protector helps us that the 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.559

 hair we are going to give you that was had 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.100
 collagen with which we are going to give 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.929
 flexibility and we will be 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.879
 rebuilding the capillary figure and 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:02.379
 Let's give movement and brightness and good 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.449
 especially for us if we 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.280
 we apply at home we will be very much 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.560
 easier ironing we will 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.909
 ask mica you usually have 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.140
 the hair enough you told me with a 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.120
 volume 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.300
 with a lot of volume and quite curly and 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.380
 frightened to the worst all in one and good 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.470
 with the 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.940
 occasion I can a little improve all the 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.680
 negative aspects of my hair 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.940
 well I do not see them negative because 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.710
 you have a very nice mane but now 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.810
 we know that we always want it 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.000
 in another way, as the 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.920
 nature things are like that I wanted you 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.050
 ask mica you this apply today 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.580
 We had Maria because we needed 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.900
 someone will explain it to us but you 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.310
 this you can give at home comfortably 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.930
 I decided in fact I try to give it 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.190
 daily every time I go to 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.649
 iron and if I'm not going to think too 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.810
 because it nourishes and that always brings shine 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:49.780
 and regenerates it hard enough the 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:53.440
 little boat yes very many washed the truth 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.000
 that the applications are very short and 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.390
 as it comes pulverized it stays like 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.320
 some little trickles and also travel 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:05.860
 that is also quite useful only knows 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.350
 I already see that he uses it slowly 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.899
 statesman to the largest portion of all the 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.250
 line 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.840
 thank you so much I'm just going to 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.629
 finish because I had to ask you that 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.489
 mane that you have me maría tell me how 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:20.319
 You get it good because it 's also the one 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.510
 simply based on butter with 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.450
 many products from the simple line 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.909
 mud maintenance the finish uses 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.459
 to iron me then things like carmine 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:34.060
 It's worth the biggest deposit then you get 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.409
 these results as nothing that takes note 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.549
 and well you can not feel it 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:38.829
 but the products smell on top 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.269
 if they smell great that sometimes it seems 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:42.280
 that we are going to carry those smells 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.920
 strong good as almost to creampie 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.700
 good coconut you have taken good note to the 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.700
 so apply it
