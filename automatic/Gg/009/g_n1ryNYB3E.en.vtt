00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.640
 moment 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:28.430
 put your foot on the floor a second before and 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.430

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.720
 blow not child well and the novel is great 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.730
 struck there helped a small ricochet 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.569
 looks like a crack in the wall 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.900
 Ibrahim Balde also wants to break the run 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.900
 where 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.490

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.830

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.240
 Better core in the Russian Championship beating 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.350

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.880

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:23.580
 Here is the action of Sergey Ryzhikov 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:29.770
