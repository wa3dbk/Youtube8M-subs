here<00:02:43.170> you're<00:02:43.350> just<00:02:43.380> really<00:02:43.770> assembling<00:02:44.490> the

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
here you're just really assembling the

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:59.840 
here you're just really assembling the
pyramid<00:02:57.200> once<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.380> glue<00:02:58.590> has<00:02:58.620> dried<00:02:58.860> this<00:02:59.580> is

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
pyramid once the glue has dried this is

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.450 
pyramid once the glue has dried this is
what<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.270> pyramid<00:03:00.840> should<00:03:01.170> look<00:03:01.410> like<00:03:01.440> if<00:03:02.010> it

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
what the pyramid should look like if it

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.010 
what the pyramid should look like if it
looks<00:03:02.700> similar<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.180> this<00:03:03.330> then<00:03:03.630> you<00:03:03.660> did<00:03:03.930> it

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
looks similar to this then you did it

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.710 
looks similar to this then you did it
