00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
basically now your standard Standa moves

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.689 
basically now your standard Standa moves
you've<00:00:29.960> got<00:00:30.080> if<00:00:30.260> you<00:00:30.350> use<00:00:30.470> X<00:00:30.710> then<00:00:31.250> you<00:00:31.430> will<00:00:31.550> do

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:31.699 
you've got if you use X then you will do

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.299 
you've got if you use X then you will do
two<00:00:32.269> steps<00:00:32.480> and<00:00:32.750> then<00:00:32.870> a<00:00:32.900> down<00:00:33.320> tour<00:00:33.590> slash<00:00:34.040> and

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
two steps and then a down tour slash and

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.410 
two steps and then a down tour slash and
then<00:00:35.059> if<00:00:35.269> you<00:00:35.390> press<00:00:35.570> a<00:00:35.960> instead<00:00:37.239> you<00:00:38.239> will

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
then if you press a instead you will

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.240 
then if you press a instead you will
fire<00:00:38.690> off<00:00:38.809> your<00:00:38.960> button<00:00:39.199> now<00:00:39.710> you<00:00:39.770> can<00:00:40.010> factor

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
fire off your button now you can factor

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.500 
fire off your button now you can factor
this<00:00:40.309> into<00:00:40.460> the<00:00:40.579> combo<00:00:40.850> so<00:00:41.030> typically<00:00:41.360> you

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
this into the combo so typically you

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:42.880 
this into the combo so typically you
would<00:00:41.630> sort<00:00:41.780> of<00:00:41.840> you<00:00:41.930> know<00:00:41.960> stab<00:00:42.559> a<00:00:42.590> couple<00:00:42.829> of

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
would sort of you know stab a couple of

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.170 
would sort of you know stab a couple of
times<00:00:43.070> and<00:00:43.219> then<00:00:43.340> you<00:00:43.399> press<00:00:43.550> a<00:00:43.700> to<00:00:43.760> shoot<00:00:44.059> off

you crisp white meat or ey X then you
can<00:00:52.579> stab<00:00:53.050> but<00:00:54.050> if<00:00:54.230> you<00:00:54.379> have<00:00:54.649> your<00:00:55.039> shield<00:00:55.670> up

can stab but if you have your shield up
new<00:00:55.879> press<00:00:56.059> a<00:00:56.210> it<00:00:56.719> basically<00:00:56.960> reloads<00:00:57.379> because

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
new press a it basically reloads because

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.100 
new press a it basically reloads because
obviously<00:00:57.920> there<00:00:58.309> is<00:00:58.399> a<00:00:58.430> gun<00:00:58.670> part<00:00:58.969> to<00:00:59.180> your<00:00:59.390> to

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
obviously there is a gun part to your to

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.750 
obviously there is a gun part to your to
your<00:01:00.320> um<00:01:00.559> Lance

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
your um Lance

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.069 
your um Lance
so<00:01:01.940> once<00:01:02.210> you've<00:01:02.360> used<00:01:02.570> all<00:01:02.660> those<00:01:02.750> bullets

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
so once you've used all those bullets

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:04.810

you<00:01:03.230> need<00:01:03.350> to<00:01:03.440> reload<00:01:03.710> so<00:01:03.920> you<00:01:04.220> do<00:01:04.399> that<00:01:04.580> by

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
you need to reload so you do that by

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.260 
you need to reload so you do that by
pressing<00:01:05.000> R<00:01:05.360> and<00:01:05.660> a<00:01:05.930> now<00:01:06.860> if<00:01:07.130> you<00:01:07.430> have<00:01:07.759> your

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
pressing R and a now if you have your

pressing R and a now if you have your
shield<00:01:08.450> up<00:01:08.600> and<00:01:08.780> you<00:01:08.869> press<00:01:09.080> X<00:01:09.649> and<00:01:09.830> a<00:01:09.950> together

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 
shield up and you press X and a together

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.289 
shield up and you press X and a together
that<00:01:11.510> will<00:01:11.600> basically<00:01:11.780> do<00:01:12.110> a<00:01:12.350> sort<00:01:13.220> of

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
that will basically do a sort of

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:16.030 
that will basically do a sort of
powerful<00:01:14.299> charge<00:01:14.810> explosion<00:01:15.470> shot<00:01:15.680> and<00:01:15.979> you

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
powerful charge explosion shot and you

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.830 
powerful charge explosion shot and you
just<00:01:16.220> saw<00:01:16.310> there<00:01:16.520> this<00:01:17.270> will<00:01:17.450> different<00:01:17.720> from

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
just saw there this will different from

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.640 
just saw there this will different from
weapon<00:01:18.080> to<00:01:18.140> weapon<00:01:18.580> but<00:01:19.689> for<00:01:20.689> this<00:01:20.750> one<00:01:20.960> as<00:01:21.560> you

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
weapon to weapon but for this one as you

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.350 
weapon to weapon but for this one as you
can<00:01:21.710> see<00:01:21.950> it's<00:01:22.070> tedious<00:01:22.310> or<00:01:22.549> crazy<00:01:23.119> explosion

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
can see it's tedious or crazy explosion

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.810 
can see it's tedious or crazy explosion
in<00:01:23.600> front<00:01:23.750> now<00:01:24.409> once<00:01:25.100> you've<00:01:25.250> done<00:01:25.280> that<00:01:25.430> you

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
in front now once you've done that you

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.550 
in front now once you've done that you
do<00:01:25.970> need<00:01:26.119> to<00:01:26.330> give<00:01:27.049> the<00:01:27.140> chart<00:01:27.350> their

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
do need to give the chart their

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.690 
do need to give the chart their
workbench<00:01:27.799> shot<00:01:27.920> to<00:01:28.040> cool<00:01:28.159> down<00:01:28.310> and<00:01:28.580> then

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
workbench shot to cool down and then

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.999 
workbench shot to cool down and then
once<00:01:29.330> you<00:01:29.420> attack<00:01:29.630> the<00:01:30.049> enemy<00:01:30.080> for<00:01:30.380> a<00:01:30.439> bit<00:01:30.619> it

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
once you attack the enemy for a bit it

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.100 
once you attack the enemy for a bit it
will<00:01:31.220> recharge<00:01:31.759> and<00:01:32.119> you<00:01:32.299> can<00:01:32.450> go<00:01:32.600> and<00:01:32.869> do<00:01:32.990> that

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
will recharge and you can go and do that

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.870 
will recharge and you can go and do that
again<00:01:33.320> so<00:01:33.890> obviously<00:01:34.130> you<00:01:34.220> can't<00:01:34.340> do<00:01:34.490> that<00:01:34.670> on

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
again so obviously you can't do that on

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.160 
again so obviously you can't do that on
repeat<00:01:36.040> but<00:01:37.040> that<00:01:37.759> is<00:01:38.060> still<00:01:38.299> quite<00:01:38.600> useful<00:01:38.930> to

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
repeat but that is still quite useful to

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.840 
repeat but that is still quite useful to
use<00:01:39.320> you<00:01:39.979> wouldn't<00:01:40.250> really<00:01:40.369> want<00:01:40.490> to<00:01:40.610> use<00:01:40.729> it

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
use you wouldn't really want to use it

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.130 
use you wouldn't really want to use it
unless<00:01:40.970> the<00:01:41.150> enemies<00:01:41.390> pinned<00:01:41.600> down<00:01:41.720> so<00:01:42.020> again

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
unless the enemies pinned down so again

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.420 
unless the enemies pinned down so again
it's<00:01:42.380> a<00:01:42.500> great<00:01:42.710> weapon<00:01:42.829> to<00:01:43.040> use<00:01:43.159> they're

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
it's a great weapon to use they're

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.219 
it's a great weapon to use they're
stunned<00:01:43.670> or<00:01:43.939> they're<00:01:44.150> in<00:01:44.509> October<00:01:45.020> or<00:01:45.049> if

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
stunned or they're in October or if

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:46.569 
stunned or they're in October or if

afford you the ability to roll so you

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.280 
afford you the ability to roll so you

to use the shield and then side stick
your<00:01:59.509> attacks<00:02:00.399> so<00:02:01.399> again<00:02:02.210> if<00:02:02.360> you<00:02:02.540> are<00:02:02.840> used<00:02:03.380> to

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
your attacks so again if you are used to

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:04.440 
your attacks so again if you are used to
having<00:02:03.770> no<00:02:03.920> mobility

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
having no mobility

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.510 
having no mobility
or<00:02:04.780> you<00:02:04.990> like<00:02:05.619> the<00:02:05.770> freedom<00:02:06.070> to<00:02:06.100> roll<00:02:06.310> then

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
or you like the freedom to roll then

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.800 
or you like the freedom to roll then
perhaps<00:02:06.939> this<00:02:07.119> isn't<00:02:07.270> the<00:02:07.360> weapon<00:02:07.630> for<00:02:07.720> you

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
perhaps this isn't the weapon for you

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.749 
perhaps this isn't the weapon for you
but<00:02:08.319> if<00:02:08.560> you<00:02:08.679> do<00:02:08.800> want<00:02:08.979> to<00:02:09.039> use<00:02:09.130> it<00:02:09.310> you<00:02:09.550> just

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
but if you do want to use it you just

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.300 
but if you do want to use it you just
need<00:02:09.940> to<00:02:10.060> adjust<00:02:10.149> your<00:02:10.390> style<00:02:10.660> of<00:02:10.750> play<00:02:11.310> anyway

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
need to adjust your style of play anyway

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.040 
need to adjust your style of play anyway

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
going to jump straight into fighting leg

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.170 
going to jump straight into fighting leg
on<00:02:14.170> B<00:02:14.290> again<00:02:14.650> just<00:02:15.250> so<00:02:15.370> soft<00:02:15.700> show<00:02:15.880> you<00:02:15.940> a<00:02:16.000> few

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
on B again just so soft show you a few

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.260 
on B again just so soft show you a few
of<00:02:16.209> the<00:02:16.300> moves<00:02:16.390> in<00:02:16.540> action<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:18.400> then<00:02:18.700> go<00:02:19.180> from

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
of the moves in action and then go from

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.790 
of the moves in action and then go from
there<00:02:19.480> again<00:02:20.110> like<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.380> other<00:02:20.410> one<00:02:20.620> I'll

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
there again like the other one I'll

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.740 
there again like the other one I'll
typically<00:02:21.160> run<00:02:21.280> up<00:02:21.370> to<00:02:21.489> the<00:02:21.610> enemy<00:02:22.270> and<00:02:22.540> start

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
typically run up to the enemy and start

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.330 
typically run up to the enemy and start
off<00:02:22.900> by<00:02:23.110> obviously<00:02:23.680> drawn<00:02:23.920> the<00:02:24.010> weapon<00:02:24.250> and

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
off by obviously drawn the weapon and

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.070 
off by obviously drawn the weapon and
trying<00:02:24.489> to<00:02:24.550> get<00:02:24.640> a<00:02:24.670> few<00:02:24.819> quick<00:02:25.000> stabs<00:02:25.239> in<00:02:25.420> now

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
trying to get a few quick stabs in now

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.630 
trying to get a few quick stabs in now
if<00:02:26.200> it<00:02:26.319> so<00:02:26.440> if<00:02:26.590> it<00:02:26.709> turns<00:02:26.860> to<00:02:27.010> me<00:02:27.100> quite<00:02:27.250> fast<00:02:27.489> it

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
if it so if it turns to me quite fast it

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.830 
if it so if it turns to me quite fast it
looks<00:02:27.760> like<00:02:27.850> an<00:02:28.120> attack<00:02:28.330> then<00:02:28.569> I'll<00:02:28.660> put<00:02:28.780> my

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
looks like an attack then I'll put my

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.350 
looks like an attack then I'll put my
shield<00:02:29.080> up<00:02:29.370> take<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.489> attack<00:02:30.700> and<00:02:31.000> then<00:02:31.209> try

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
shield up take the attack and then try

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.600 
shield up take the attack and then try
and<00:02:31.480> try<00:02:31.840> sort<00:02:32.019> of<00:02:32.080> power<00:02:32.230> through<00:02:32.500> it<00:02:32.620> however

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
and try sort of power through it however

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.540 
and try sort of power through it however
if<00:02:34.260> it's<00:02:35.260> or<00:02:35.500> looking<00:02:35.769> someone<00:02:36.069> else<00:02:36.220> and<00:02:36.459> I've

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
if it's or looking someone else and I've

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.479 
if it's or looking someone else and I've
got<00:02:36.670> more<00:02:36.760> chance<00:02:37.000> then<00:02:37.330> I'll<00:02:37.810> typically

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
got more chance then I'll typically

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.490 
got more chance then I'll typically
lengthen<00:02:39.489> my<00:02:39.550> combo<00:02:39.880> and<00:02:40.300> then<00:02:40.540> chucking<00:02:41.440> a

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
lengthen my combo and then chucking a

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.910 
lengthen my combo and then chucking a
few

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
few

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.229 
few
gun<00:02:42.190> blasts<00:02:42.430> to<00:02:42.610> try<00:02:42.730> and<00:02:42.850> do<00:02:42.910> some<00:02:43.060> extra

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
gun blasts to try and do some extra

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.110 
gun blasts to try and do some extra
damage<00:02:43.739> and<00:02:44.739> then<00:02:45.640> obviously<00:02:45.790> you<00:02:46.000> need<00:02:46.060> to

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
damage and then obviously you need to

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.780 
damage and then obviously you need to
sidestep<00:02:46.450> wherever<00:02:46.840> if<00:02:47.830> course<00:02:48.400> you<00:02:48.519> do<00:02:48.610> get

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
sidestep wherever if course you do get

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.809 
sidestep wherever if course you do get
the<00:02:48.850> chance<00:02:48.880> then<00:02:49.840> unleashing<00:02:50.410> the<00:02:50.950> fall<00:02:51.610> sort

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
the chance then unleashing the fall sort

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.120 
the chance then unleashing the fall sort
of<00:02:51.880> chart<00:02:52.360> is<00:02:52.510> a<00:02:52.569> really<00:02:52.989> good<00:02:53.110> thing<00:02:53.290> because

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
of chart is a really good thing because

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.979 
of chart is a really good thing because
it<00:02:54.340> is<00:02:54.370> so<00:02:54.519> powerful<00:02:54.730> you're<00:02:55.510> likely<00:02:55.720> to<00:02:55.870> be

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
it is so powerful you're likely to be

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.280 
it is so powerful you're likely to be
able<00:02:56.140> to<00:02:56.459> stagger<00:02:57.459> the<00:02:57.640> enemy<00:02:57.850> quite<00:02:58.030> quickly

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
able to stagger the enemy quite quickly

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.360 
able to stagger the enemy quite quickly
and<00:02:59.290> obviously<00:02:59.410> that's<00:02:59.680> useful<00:02:59.920> because<00:03:00.100> if

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
and obviously that's useful because if

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.009 
and obviously that's useful because if
you're<00:03:00.790> charging<00:03:01.120> up<00:03:01.209> an<00:03:01.330> enemy<00:03:01.540> turns<00:03:01.750> to<00:03:01.900> you

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
you're charging up an enemy turns to you

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.380 
you're charging up an enemy turns to you
then<00:03:02.620> the<00:03:03.100> fact<00:03:03.310> that<00:03:03.370> you<00:03:03.459> have<00:03:04.030> quite<00:03:04.180> a<00:03:04.209> good

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
then the fact that you have quite a good

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.270 
then the fact that you have quite a good
chance<00:03:04.569> of<00:03:04.660> staggering<00:03:04.959> it<00:03:05.170> will<00:03:05.440> potentially

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
chance of staggering it will potentially

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.870 
chance of staggering it will potentially
stop<00:03:06.549> you<00:03:06.640> from<00:03:06.700> getting<00:03:06.819> hit<00:03:07.090> but<00:03:08.049> anyway<00:03:08.500> I'm

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
stop you from getting hit but anyway I'm

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.150 
stop you from getting hit but anyway I'm
gonna<00:03:09.880> wrap<00:03:10.120> up<00:03:10.269> there<00:03:10.570> that's<00:03:11.019> just<00:03:11.170> a<00:03:11.440> quick

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
gonna wrap up there that's just a quick

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.710 
gonna wrap up there that's just a quick
overview<00:03:12.370> again<00:03:12.700> of<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:13.299> gun<00:03:13.510> lines

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
overview again of the gun lines

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.930 
overview again of the gun lines
hopefully<00:03:14.620> if<00:03:14.829> you<00:03:15.070> are<00:03:15.220> new<00:03:15.489> to<00:03:15.519> the<00:03:15.670> game<00:03:15.790> you

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
hopefully if you are new to the game you

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.970 
hopefully if you are new to the game you
