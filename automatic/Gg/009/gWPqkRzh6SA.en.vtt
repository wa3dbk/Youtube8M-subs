00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
hi guys this is remag I'm just making

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.340 
hi guys this is remag I'm just making
this<00:00:04.140> video<00:00:04.319> because<00:00:04.799> I<00:00:05.339> noticed<00:00:05.700> as<00:00:05.850> a<00:00:06.350> video

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
this video because I noticed as a video

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.549 
this video because I noticed as a video
recorded<00:00:08.160> in<00:00:08.309> game<00:00:08.730> for<00:00:09.150> planetside<00:00:09.660> 2<00:00:09.960> I've

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
recorded in game for planetside 2 I've

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.370 
recorded in game for planetside 2 I've
just<00:00:10.830> picked<00:00:11.010> this<00:00:11.190> up<00:00:11.250> via<00:00:11.849> paying<00:00:12.570> through

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
just picked this up via paying through

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.950 
just picked this up via paying through
other<00:00:13.950> words<00:00:14.190> it<00:00:14.280> 30<00:00:14.880> create<00:00:15.330> I<00:00:15.420> think<00:00:15.630> for<00:00:15.870> the

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
other words it 30 create I think for the

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.650 
other words it 30 create I think for the
for<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.379> beta<00:00:16.560> access<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.880> few<00:00:18.029> goodies<00:00:18.390> as

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
for the beta access and a few goodies as

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.880 
for the beta access and a few goodies as
well<00:00:18.810> so<00:00:18.990> I<00:00:19.020> thought<00:00:19.170> it'd<00:00:19.289> be<00:00:19.380> worth<00:00:19.560> it<00:00:19.740> just

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
well so I thought it'd be worth it just

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.470 
well so I thought it'd be worth it just
to<00:00:19.980> get<00:00:20.189> in<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.520> lot<00:00:20.850> of<00:00:20.910> my<00:00:21.090> friends<00:00:21.270> are

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
to get in a lot of my friends are

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.880 
to get in a lot of my friends are
playing<00:00:21.660> it<00:00:21.869> so<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.140> thought<00:00:22.500> why<00:00:23.279> not<00:00:23.390> I

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
playing it so I thought why not I

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.529 
playing it so I thought why not I
noticed<00:00:25.890> it's<00:00:26.130> got<00:00:26.250> this<00:00:26.340> video<00:00:26.670> recorder

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
noticed it's got this video recorder

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.810 
noticed it's got this video recorder
which<00:00:27.930> also<00:00:28.140> has<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.439> twitch<00:00:28.800> TV<00:00:29.160> tab<00:00:29.550> so<00:00:29.789> I

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
which also has a twitch TV tab so I

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.970 
which also has a twitch TV tab so I
guess<00:00:30.090> they'll<00:00:30.439> allow<00:00:31.439> for<00:00:31.679> streaming

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
guess they'll allow for streaming

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.700 
guess they'll allow for streaming
directly<00:00:32.910> from<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.870> actual<00:00:34.110> game<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:34.620> you

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
directly from the actual game so you

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.090 
directly from the actual game so you
won't<00:00:34.890> need<00:00:34.950> any<00:00:35.130> software<00:00:35.670> for<00:00:36.030> that<00:00:36.270> I

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
won't need any software for that I

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.560 
won't need any software for that I
wanted<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.190> check<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.700> quality<00:00:38.879> of<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.420> though

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
wanted to check the quality of it though

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.600 
wanted to check the quality of it though
so<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:39.870> can<00:00:40.050> see<00:00:40.200> here<00:00:40.440> it's<00:00:40.620> got<00:00:40.770> youtube

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
so you can see here it's got youtube

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.220 
so you can see here it's got youtube
login<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.210> i<00:00:42.239> guess<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.600> does<00:00:42.750> links<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.200> to

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
login so i guess that does links it to

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.190 
login so i guess that does links it to
the<00:00:43.350> account<00:00:43.910> it<00:00:44.910> will<00:00:44.940> run<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.899> save<00:00:46.170> it

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
the account it will run it and save it

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.880 
the account it will run it and save it
into<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:47.510> hard<00:00:48.510> drive<00:00:48.840> folder<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.680> won't

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
into a hard drive folder so it won't

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.069 
into a hard drive folder so it won't
upload<00:00:50.610> directly<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.270> YouTube<00:00:51.390> or<00:00:51.840> anything

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
upload directly to YouTube or anything

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.479 
upload directly to YouTube or anything
like<00:00:52.110> that<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.590> don't<00:00:53.160> think<00:00:53.280> that's<00:00:53.340> even

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
like that I don't think that's even

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.900 
like that I don't think that's even
possible<00:00:54.680> but<00:00:55.680> it's<00:00:55.800> yes<00:00:56.129> it's<00:00:56.489> quite<00:00:56.640> cool

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
possible but it's yes it's quite cool

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.479 
possible but it's yes it's quite cool
you've<00:00:57.809> got<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.109> there<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.559> tested<00:00:59.309> the

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
you've got that there I tested the

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.040 
you've got that there I tested the
quality<00:01:00.000> so<00:01:00.239> you're<00:01:00.359> going<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.539> see<00:01:00.719> some

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
quality so you're going to see some

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.630 
quality so you're going to see some
footage<00:01:02.390> just<00:01:03.390> coming<00:01:03.690> up<00:01:03.809> now<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:04.650> me

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
footage just coming up now of me

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.730

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
recording with the in-game battle

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.219 
recording with the in-game battle
recorder<00:01:08.189> or<00:01:08.310> whatever<00:01:08.549> it's<00:01:08.700> called<00:01:08.960> so<00:01:09.960> here

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
recorder or whatever it's called so here

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.760 
recorder or whatever it's called so here

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
is the footage as me shooting at some

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.130 
is the footage as me shooting at some
random<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:14.369> think<00:01:14.549> it's<00:01:14.670> an<00:01:14.729> enemy<00:01:15.450> Galaxy<00:01:16.110> or

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
random I think it's an enemy Galaxy or

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.420 
random I think it's an enemy Galaxy or
something<00:01:16.229> like<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.590> with<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.159> tank

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
something like that with the tank

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.460 
something like that with the tank
missing<00:01:18.210> quite<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.450> lot<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.810> did<00:01:19.080> hit<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.290> the

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
missing quite a lot I did hit it the

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.969 
missing quite a lot I did hit it the
first<00:01:19.680> time<00:01:19.799> which<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.130> quite<00:01:20.369> lucky<00:01:21.860> but<00:01:22.860> as

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
first time which is quite lucky but as

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.039 
first time which is quite lucky but as
you<00:01:23.130> can<00:01:23.250> see<00:01:23.520> it's<00:01:23.939> not<00:01:24.240> it's<00:01:24.570> not<00:01:24.689> quite

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
you can see it's not it's not quite

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.289 
you can see it's not it's not quite
there<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.500> think<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:26.580> know<00:01:26.729> obviously<00:01:27.000> once

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
there I think you know obviously once

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.510 
there I think you know obviously once
you<00:01:27.450> get<00:01:27.630> past<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:28.020> YouTube<00:01:28.470> compression<00:01:29.400> as

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
you get past the YouTube compression as

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.429 
you get past the YouTube compression as
well<00:01:29.700> it's<00:01:30.240> probably<00:01:30.509> not<00:01:30.630> going<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.810> be<00:01:30.869> so

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
well it's probably not going to be so

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.679 
well it's probably not going to be so
different<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.670> know<00:01:32.820> but<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.210> think<00:01:33.450> you'll

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
different you know but I think you'll

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.920 
different you know but I think you'll
notice<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.259> on<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.409> 1080p<00:01:35.659> resolution<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:36.810> know

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
notice it on a 1080p resolution you know

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.640

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.389 
will be dxtory recording so this here
now<00:01:56.399> is<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.790> X<00:01:57.390> story<00:01:57.890> so<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:58.950> should<00:01:59.219> be<00:01:59.250> able

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
now is the X story so you should be able

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.980 
now is the X story so you should be able
to<00:01:59.640> see<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.090> difference<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:00.659> know<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:00.840> should

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
to see the difference you know it should

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.940 
to see the difference you know it should
be<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.140> lot<00:02:01.320> clearer

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
be a lot clearer

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.270 
be a lot clearer
you'll<00:02:02.789> have<00:02:03.770> you'll<00:02:04.770> be<00:02:04.860> able<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.009> see<00:02:05.159> the

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
you'll have you'll be able to see the

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.789 
you'll have you'll be able to see the
rising<00:02:05.759> things<00:02:06.030> like<00:02:06.210> that<00:02:06.360> in<00:02:07.049> this<00:02:07.320> clip<00:02:07.619> on

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
rising things like that in this clip on

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.800 
rising things like that in this clip on
I<00:02:08.009> just<00:02:08.280> basically<00:02:08.789> came<00:02:09.149> across<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.450> bunch<00:02:09.660> of

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
I just basically came across a bunch of

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.570 
I just basically came across a bunch of
guys<00:02:09.959> and<00:02:10.200> tank<00:02:10.470> so<00:02:10.769> I<00:02:10.800> do<00:02:10.920> I<00:02:11.039> just<00:02:11.370> tagged

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
guys and tank so I do I just tagged

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.290 
guys and tank so I do I just tagged
along<00:02:12.290> videos<00:02:13.290> get<00:02:13.620> a<00:02:13.650> good<00:02:13.830> fun<00:02:14.069> it's<00:02:15.030> a<00:02:15.090> bit

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
along videos get a good fun it's a bit

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.300 
along videos get a good fun it's a bit
of<00:02:15.390> infantry<00:02:16.050> play<00:02:16.230> here<00:02:16.500> as<00:02:16.590> well<00:02:16.739> but<00:02:17.220> you

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
of infantry play here as well but you

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.270 
of infantry play here as well but you
should<00:02:17.340> see<00:02:17.700> it's<00:02:17.910> a<00:02:18.030> lot<00:02:18.180> more<00:02:18.980> well<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.010> lot

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
should see it's a lot more well a lot

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.190 
should see it's a lot more well a lot
clearer<00:02:20.640> really<00:02:21.000> so<00:02:21.330> I<00:02:21.630> don't<00:02:21.959> think<00:02:22.110> the

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
clearer really so I don't think the

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.199 
clearer really so I don't think the
battle<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.769> in-game<00:02:23.010> battle<00:02:23.400> recorder<00:02:23.910> is

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
battle the in-game battle recorder is

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.479 
battle the in-game battle recorder is
quite<00:02:24.510> there<00:02:24.780> it<00:02:25.440> doesn't<00:02:25.800> seem<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:25.980> record

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
quite there it doesn't seem to record

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.780 
quite there it doesn't seem to record
audio<00:02:26.790> either<00:02:27.360> which<00:02:27.510> is<00:02:27.660> a<00:02:27.690> slight<00:02:27.989> issue<00:02:28.790> you

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
audio either which is a slight issue you

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.990 
audio either which is a slight issue you
know<00:02:29.910> you've<00:02:30.269> got<00:02:30.299> no<00:02:31.010> no<00:02:32.010> in-game<00:02:32.250> audio<00:02:32.610> to

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
know you've got no no in-game audio to

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.059 
know you've got no no in-game audio to
also<00:02:33.390> voice<00:02:34.019> columns<00:02:34.470> for<00:02:34.560> anything<00:02:34.739> what

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
also voice columns for anything what

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.949 
also voice columns for anything what
when<00:02:35.280> he<00:02:35.459> picks<00:02:35.670> up<00:02:35.849> I<00:02:36.150> guess<00:02:36.630> that<00:02:36.840> would<00:02:36.900> be

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
when he picks up I guess that would be

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.839 
when he picks up I guess that would be
sorted<00:02:37.500> out<00:02:37.590> there<00:02:37.830> I<00:02:37.860> get<00:02:38.099> to<00:02:38.160> put<00:02:38.310> it<00:02:38.430> sbisa

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
sorted out there I get to put it sbisa

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.470 
sorted out there I get to put it sbisa
beat<00:02:39.360> thing<00:02:40.069> yes<00:02:41.069> so<00:02:41.430> it's<00:02:41.579> a<00:02:41.640> good<00:02:41.819> idea<00:02:41.970> it

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
beat thing yes so it's a good idea it

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.020 
beat thing yes so it's a good idea it
should<00:02:42.720> it<00:02:43.049> should<00:02:43.079> evolve<00:02:43.860> games<00:02:44.489> if<00:02:44.760> are<00:02:44.910> the

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
should it should evolve games if are the

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.120 
should it should evolve games if are the
games<00:02:45.239> implement<00:02:45.989> that<00:02:46.079> in<00:02:46.290> built<00:02:46.739> as<00:02:46.890> well

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
games implement that in built as well

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.360 
games implement that in built as well
such<00:02:47.549> as<00:02:47.579> streaming<00:02:48.590> it<00:02:49.590> will<00:02:49.769> allow<00:02:49.980> for

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
such as streaming it will allow for

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.039 
such as streaming it will allow for
eSports<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.180> things<00:02:51.299> like<00:02:51.450> that<00:02:51.510> through

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
eSports and things like that through

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.000 
eSports and things like that through
games<00:02:53.010> like<00:02:54.530> Battlefield<00:02:55.530> and<00:02:55.709> things<00:02:55.860> like

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
games like Battlefield and things like

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.830 
games like Battlefield and things like
that<00:02:56.069> I<00:02:56.370> mean<00:02:56.519> they<00:02:56.610> do<00:02:56.670> have<00:02:57.030> some<00:02:57.269> lands<00:02:57.510> but

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
that I mean they do have some lands but

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.600 
that I mean they do have some lands but
I<00:02:57.870> think<00:02:58.079> they're<00:02:58.260> they're<00:02:58.709> dying<00:02:58.980> out<00:02:59.250> quite

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
I think they're they're dying out quite

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.460 
I think they're they're dying out quite
rapidly<00:03:00.000> because<00:03:00.480> people<00:03:00.989> can't<00:03:01.200> watch<00:03:01.440> it

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
rapidly because people can't watch it

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.220 
rapidly because people can't watch it
very<00:03:01.739> well<00:03:02.099> there's<00:03:02.790> no<00:03:02.940> space<00:03:03.299> spectator

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
very well there's no space spectator

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.830 
very well there's no space spectator
privilege<00:03:04.950> at<00:03:05.370> all<00:03:05.579> with<00:03:06.030> it<00:03:06.150> really<00:03:06.389> doesn't

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
privilege at all with it really doesn't

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.309 
privilege at all with it really doesn't
it<00:03:07.560> doesn't<00:03:07.650> appeal<00:03:08.040> to<00:03:08.100> that<00:03:08.370> so<00:03:08.870> if<00:03:09.870> other

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
it doesn't appeal to that so if other

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.349 
it doesn't appeal to that so if other
games<00:03:10.680> such<00:03:11.040> as<00:03:11.069> battlefield<00:03:11.489> 4<00:03:11.880> pick<00:03:12.150> this

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
games such as battlefield 4 pick this

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.229 
games such as battlefield 4 pick this
kind<00:03:12.690> of<00:03:12.720> idea<00:03:12.930> up<00:03:13.319> it's<00:03:13.980> going<00:03:14.160> to<00:03:14.190> bring<00:03:14.459> that

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
kind of idea up it's going to bring that

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.030 
kind of idea up it's going to bring that
aspect<00:03:15.720> to<00:03:15.900> it<00:03:15.930> you<00:03:16.170> know<00:03:16.290> so<00:03:16.560> it<00:03:16.620> could<00:03:17.010> be

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
aspect to it you know so it could be

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.280 
aspect to it you know so it could be
quite<00:03:17.310> good<00:03:17.609> sort<00:03:17.910> of<00:03:17.940> innovation<00:03:18.540> so<00:03:19.230> to

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
quite good sort of innovation so to

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.440 
quite good sort of innovation so to
speak<00:03:19.560> so<00:03:20.549> I<00:03:20.579> thought<00:03:20.760> I'd<00:03:20.910> do<00:03:21.060> this<00:03:21.209> anyway

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
speak so I thought I'd do this anyway

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.629 
speak so I thought I'd do this anyway
just<00:03:21.600> so<00:03:21.690> if<00:03:22.200> anyone's<00:03:22.650> thinking<00:03:22.920> oh<00:03:23.340> I'll

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
just so if anyone's thinking oh I'll

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:26.090 
just so if anyone's thinking oh I'll
just<00:03:23.670> use<00:03:24.030> this<00:03:24.090> in<00:03:24.389> Game<00:03:24.680> recorder<00:03:25.680> your

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
just use this in Game recorder your

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.940 
just use this in Game recorder your
noticed<00:03:26.519> equality<00:03:27.030> is<00:03:27.329> up<00:03:27.870> to<00:03:28.079> par<00:03:28.260> and<00:03:28.620> it

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
noticed equality is up to par and it

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.129 
noticed equality is up to par and it
doesn't<00:03:29.220> have<00:03:29.310> audio<00:03:29.459> as<00:03:29.760> well<00:03:29.790> so<00:03:30.239> there<00:03:30.989> you

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
doesn't have audio as well so there you

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.129 
doesn't have audio as well so there you
go<00:03:31.170> there's<00:03:31.859> the<00:03:32.540> kind<00:03:33.540> of<00:03:33.569> review<00:03:33.959> if<00:03:34.109> you

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
go there's the kind of review if you

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:36.020 
go there's the kind of review if you
like<00:03:34.410> if<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:34.769> in-game<00:03:35.069> recorder<00:03:35.880> for

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
like if the in-game recorder for

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.110 
like if the in-game recorder for
planetside<00:03:36.470> hopefully<00:03:37.850> it<00:03:38.850> will<00:03:38.970> get

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
planetside hopefully it will get

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.910 
planetside hopefully it will get
improved<00:03:39.720> a<00:03:39.900> little<00:03:40.019> bit<00:03:40.290> maybe<00:03:40.530> it'll<00:03:40.769> have

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
improved a little bit maybe it'll have

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.039 
improved a little bit maybe it'll have
better<00:03:41.100> options<00:03:41.340> but<00:03:41.760> for<00:03:41.910> now<00:03:42.060> don't<00:03:42.840> use<00:03:43.019> it

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
better options but for now don't use it

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.950 
better options but for now don't use it
Cheers
