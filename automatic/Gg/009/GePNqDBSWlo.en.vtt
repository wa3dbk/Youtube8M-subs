00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 Ministry we come to non-registered 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.430
 Madame Marion Marshal Pen 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.430
 you have two minutes for a question 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.429
 Yes Minister 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.469
 forgive me I'm going back to the 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.790
 question of the future of the wood industry 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.590
 in France but under a little axis 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.630
 different because it seems to me pretty 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.980
 essential over the reports 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.720
 parliamentarians who accumulate on the 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.250
 question since 2008 returns the same 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.320
 finding that of a big mess 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.699
 we benefit from the third forest 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.470
 of Europe in rich surface of a large 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.480
 variety of species as well as knowing 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.949
 do and huge potential for 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.540
 the wood industry represents the 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.280
 second most deficient item of 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.600
 our trade balance with around 7 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.969
 billion euros last year 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.320
 in ten years with the closure of 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.160
 several hundred carpentry 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.590
 Syria in France 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.110
 the sector has lost more than 50,000 jobs 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.270
 we produce with a surface 1.5 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.960
 times more than half our number 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.270
 German neighbors 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.010
 how do we pass such assets to this 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.750
 marasmus some causes are known 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.710
 like the parcels fragmentation where 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.760
 the lack of investment in 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.710
 the processing industry 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.989
 but the real reason is more the 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.609
 competitiveness costs of the sector in 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.769
 a context of bad globalization 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.510
 mastered we actually export to 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.640
 low- cost countries including china 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.409
 raw material raw purpose for the 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.119
 then re-import once transformed 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.460
 in furniture made of paper pulp or 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.860
 carpentry but a price of course 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.479
 superior so France sells the meter 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.020
 raw oak wood cube the most 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.020
 research 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.180
 about 80 euros once dried tried 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.619
 reimport them to 500 or even more 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.020
 2000 euros when it is transformed into 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.729
 furniture 80% of the chains we 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.560
 are exporting are sitting sold to China and 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.030
 in three years our exports to this 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.070
 countries have been multiplied by five 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.600
 once again France suffers from 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.640
 globalization and its 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.110
 a corollary to social dumping in favor 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.450
 of countries with low wages and 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.520
 social protection while a lot of 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.030
 countries have quota their exports 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.009
 to China 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.570
 we did not do anything in this sense 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.939
 and bound fists we are by car 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.159
 the free squab swingers of brussels 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.720
 my question is therefore outside the 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.399
 only change in the appropriations allocated to 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.320
 forest program what is your 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.119
 strategy to restore competitiveness 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.570
 of the wood industry and to maintain 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.490
 jobs 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.770
 I would like to know how she 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.909
 will be able to find the financial balance 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.890
 without calling into question the rules 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.970
 free swingers was sir the 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.970
 minister you have the floor 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.459
 the member on this issue you 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.439
 first mentioned it does not date 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.859
 of today and there is a real problem 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:21.359
 which is related to this situation 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:22.980
 structural change in which exports are 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:25.140
 logs especially in the 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.450
 china game i also consider that 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.640
 some have a few times a 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.659
 interest and when the timber market in 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.799
 France was sufficiently depressed 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:36.090
 many have found through 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:39.209
 the export of its logs in 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.129
 China an opportunity and person person 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.409
 did not seek to challenge it so 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.370
 we have to reverse the process to 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:45.840
 reverse the process 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.220
 there are first the questions of 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.489
 competitiveness but compared to the 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.950
 China 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.989
 the subject is more complex there is the 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.579
 competitiveness tax credit ago 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.250
 especially that's what I said everything to 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:58.799
 hour one the fact that we have a 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.159
 problem to develop the industry of 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.220
 wood 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:05.250
 it is the supply of wood that is ours 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.189
 she's not well organized she's getting 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.950
 quite randomly on 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:13.439
 major tenders and 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.449
 offers of wood and we must 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:17.639
 structure this offer must so this is 

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:19.769
 the whole issue of grouping 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:22.500
 the organization of wood production 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:25.470
 who can then find at that moment 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.449
 opportunities and be interesting for 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.329
 industrial tools that need 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:33.299
 to get to be profitable to have 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:36.599
 still regular supply 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:38.819
 in quantity and also in quality 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:41.519
 I visited a sawmill in the east 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.079
 who was doing shell flooring and who 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.269
 was exporting his floors 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.859
 as far as indonesia to asia and 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.780
 that they are in full development on 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:50.400
 problem they had at the time when 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.620
 I met them it was precisely 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.599
 this problem of supply management which 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.609
 was poorly controlled in France and that 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:58.739
 we have to master it's all 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:00.419
 devices that you are going to have in the 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.639
 coming law in the law of the future and 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:05.459
 that's also what was voted in the 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:08.099
 framework of the finance law in 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.500
 particular interest groups 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:13.290
 ecological and forestry 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.590
 go with a bonus of 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.090
 cracks endowments that will be 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.729
 revalued when you go for 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.079
 regroup and once we have 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:24.600
 reorganize this offer we will be able to 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.310
 moment there I am sure develop 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.690
 the industries that go with and who we 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.699
 will make value 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.240
 added on our territory rather than 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:35.780
 the loss by exporting the logs 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.780
 thank you sir min
