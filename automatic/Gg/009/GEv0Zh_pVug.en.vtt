00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:10.610 
0 v 5 CX Pro free carbon fiber tripod
manfro<00:00:09.059> so<00:00:09.120> we've<00:00:09.389> used<00:00:09.599> carbon<00:00:09.900> fiber<00:00:10.260> in<00:00:10.530> the

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
manfro so we've used carbon fiber in the

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.680 
manfro so we've used carbon fiber in the
legs<00:00:10.889> and<00:00:11.130> also<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.849> central<00:00:12.240> stem<00:00:12.480> of<00:00:12.599> the

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
legs and also the central stem of the

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.749 
legs and also the central stem of the
tripod<00:00:13.080> now<00:00:13.440> they<00:00:13.559> do<00:00:13.740> this<00:00:14.009> to<00:00:14.250> keep<00:00:14.490> weight

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
tripod now they do this to keep weight

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.120 
tripod now they do this to keep weight
down<00:00:15.059> but<00:00:15.330> also<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.809> increase<00:00:16.139> rigidity<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.830> for

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
down but also to increase rigidity a for

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.429 
down but also to increase rigidity a for
aluminium<00:00:17.250> what<00:00:18.240> Manfrotto<00:00:18.690> have<00:00:18.869> also<00:00:19.020> done

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
aluminium what Manfrotto have also done

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.060 
aluminium what Manfrotto have also done
is<00:00:19.650> use<00:00:20.130> magnesium<00:00:20.970> in<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.180> top<00:00:21.779> plate<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.350> in

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
is use magnesium in the top plate and in

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.700 
is use magnesium in the top plate and in
the<00:00:23.100> pins<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.240> legs<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:25.230> clips<00:00:25.529> on

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
the pins of the legs and the clips on

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.429 
the pins of the legs and the clips on
the<00:00:25.830> side<00:00:26.070> what<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:27.029> does<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:28.019> keeps<00:00:28.260> the

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
the side what that does is it keeps the

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.230 
the side what that does is it keeps the
weight<00:00:28.650> down<00:00:28.769> even<00:00:29.099> further<00:00:29.340> in<00:00:29.670> areas<00:00:30.090> the

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
weight down even further in areas the

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.269 
weight down even further in areas the
way<00:00:30.359> it's<00:00:30.539> not<00:00:30.840> practical<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.560> use<00:00:31.710> carbon

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
way it's not practical to use carbon

way it's not practical to use carbon
fiber<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:33.329> means<00:00:33.630> that<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.989> tripod<00:00:34.230> weighs

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
fiber this means that the tripod weighs

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.160 
fiber this means that the tripod weighs
only<00:00:34.860> 2<00:00:35.340> kilos<00:00:35.790> while<00:00:36.090> still<00:00:36.510> managing<00:00:36.750> to

stable<00:00:52.559> tripod<00:00:52.739> madam<00:00:53.430> frost<00:00:53.640> we've<00:00:53.850> also

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
stable tripod madam frost we've also

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.700 
stable tripod madam frost we've also
added<00:00:54.239> in<00:00:54.480> some<00:00:54.719> features<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.440> make<00:00:55.680> it

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
added in some features that make it

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.459 
added in some features that make it
really<00:00:56.190> practical<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.910> unique<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:58.230> they've

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
really practical and unique so they've

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.069 
really practical and unique so they've
added<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.920> center<00:00:59.309> column<00:00:59.520> 90<00:01:00.420> degree<00:01:00.690> pivot

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
added the center column 90 degree pivot

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.840 
added the center column 90 degree pivot

a really big head or one that might
normally<00:01:23.610> obscure<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.600> bottle<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.229> can<00:01:25.409> just

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
normally obscure the bottle you can just

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.499 
normally obscure the bottle you can just
rotate<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.369> an<00:01:26.490> area<00:01:26.790> where<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.119> can<00:01:27.270> see

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
rotate it to an area where you can see

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.810 
rotate it to an area where you can see
it<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:28.380> prosser<00:01:28.740> use<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.920> system<00:01:29.340> on<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.549> legs

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
it and prosser use a system on the legs

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.429 
it and prosser use a system on the legs
of<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.030> tripod<00:01:30.270> called<00:01:30.659> quick<00:01:30.900> power<00:01:31.170> lock

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
of the tripod called quick power lock

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.230 
of the tripod called quick power lock
and<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.860> makes<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.130> really<00:01:32.340> easy<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.729> set<00:01:33.090> the

and it makes it really easy to set the
tripod<00:01:33.659> up<00:01:33.689> with<00:01:33.990> one<00:01:34.200> hand<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:34.950> can<00:01:35.070> use

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
tripod up with one hand so you can use

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.340 
tripod up with one hand so you can use
one<00:01:35.369> hand<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.640> hold<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.210> just<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.720> finger<00:01:37.140> to
