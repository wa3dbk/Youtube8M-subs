Billy again because we start gonna plays
so<00:00:23.760> it's<00:00:24.000> going<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.210> be<00:00:24.269> more<00:00:24.420> common<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.160> yeah

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
so it's going to be more common and yeah

up<00:00:30.179> ankle<00:00:30.570> sweep<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.080> heat<00:00:31.199> stamp<00:00:31.500> so<00:00:32.430> you

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
up ankle sweep and heat stamp so you

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.870 
up ankle sweep and heat stamp so you
start<00:00:33.480> off<00:00:33.540> with<00:00:33.719> Leon<00:00:33.989> then<00:00:34.920> your<00:00:35.219> problem<00:00:35.579> or

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
start off with Leon then your problem or

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.370 
start off with Leon then your problem or
your<00:00:36.090> opponent<00:00:36.450> will<00:00:36.510> either<00:00:36.630> stay<00:00:36.960> in<00:00:37.170> or

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
your opponent will either stay in or

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.260 
your opponent will either stay in or
will<00:00:37.500> switch<00:00:38.100> out<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:39.360> in<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.840> turn<00:00:40.140> you

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
will switch out and and in that turn you

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.209 
will switch out and and in that turn you
release<00:00:42.270> bulk<00:00:42.510> up<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:43.320> then<00:00:43.500> once<00:00:44.040> you've

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
release bulk up so then once you've

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.830 
release bulk up so then once you've
booked<00:00:44.370> up<00:00:44.550> at<00:00:44.640> least<00:00:44.730> once<00:00:44.910> or<00:00:45.270> twice<00:00:45.390> if<00:00:45.719> it

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
booked up at least once or twice if it

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.930 
booked up at least once or twice if it
stays<00:00:46.050> in<00:00:46.230> this<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.649> sleep<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.190> you've<00:00:47.610> booked

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
stays in this is sleep and you've booked

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.060 
stays in this is sleep and you've booked
up<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.600> can<00:00:48.719> book<00:00:48.840> up<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.050> few<00:00:49.200> times<00:00:49.350> then<00:00:49.950> you

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
up you can book up a few times then you

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.470 
up you can book up a few times then you
go<00:00:50.160> for<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.370> ankle<00:00:50.460> sweep<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.390> the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
go for the ankle sweep this is the

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.490 
go for the ankle sweep this is the
chance<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.989> lowering<00:00:52.649> speed<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.480> and<00:00:54.480> put<00:00:55.469> a

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
chance of lowering speed and and put a

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.139 
chance of lowering speed and and put a
few<00:00:55.710> blue<00:00:55.829> cups<00:00:56.070> your<00:00:56.550> ink<00:00:56.670> asleep<00:00:56.910> will<00:00:57.059> be

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
few blue cups your ink asleep will be

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.689 
few blue cups your ink asleep will be
strong<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.719> you'll<00:00:58.530> be<00:00:58.680> reducing<00:00:59.129> speed<00:00:59.309> so

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
strong and you'll be reducing speed so

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.380 
strong and you'll be reducing speed so
your<00:01:00.390> end<00:01:00.600> boooo<00:01:00.809> speed<00:01:01.289> won't<00:01:01.590> be<00:01:01.739> too<00:01:02.390> much

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
your end boooo speed won't be too much

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.200 
your end boooo speed won't be too much
of<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.140> probable<00:01:04.739> for<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:04.979> so<00:01:05.670> yeah<00:01:05.850> the

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
of it and probable for it so yeah the

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.109 
of it and probable for it so yeah the
v's<00:01:07.020> we've<00:01:07.260> come<00:01:07.439> for<00:01:07.619> 140<00:01:08.520> HP<00:01:10.340> 116<00:01:11.340> defense

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
v's we've come for 140 HP 116 defense

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.890 
v's we've come for 140 HP 116 defense
and<00:01:13.520> 252<00:01:14.520> speed<00:01:15.150> now<00:01:15.960> I'm<00:01:17.630> along<00:01:18.630> with<00:01:18.810> the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
and 252 speed now I'm along with the

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.910 
and 252 speed now I'm along with the
Salik<00:01:19.229> Barry<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:21.140> when<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.290> reaches<00:01:22.650> blaze

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
Salik Barry and when it reaches blaze

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.740 
Salik Barry and when it reaches blaze
level<00:01:23.400> its<00:01:23.759> speed<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:24.030> going<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.299> go<00:01:24.390> up<00:01:24.420> anyway

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
level its speed is going to go up anyway

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:25.850 
level its speed is going to go up anyway
if<00:01:24.930> you're<00:01:25.049> just<00:01:25.259> in<00:01:25.409> case<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.619> don't<00:01:25.710> with

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
if you're just in case you don't with

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.880 
if you're just in case you don't with
ankle<00:01:26.189> sweeps<00:01:26.369> in<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:27.270> when<00:01:27.590> and<00:01:28.590> then<00:01:28.770> he

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
ankle sweeps in so when and then he

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.560 
ankle sweeps in so when and then he
stamp<00:01:29.280> will<00:01:29.579> be<00:01:29.670> powered<00:01:29.939> up<00:01:30.030> as<00:01:30.150> well<00:01:30.299> by<00:01:30.509> the

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
stamp will be powered up as well by the

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.560 
stamp will be powered up as well by the
place<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:32.159> could<00:01:33.030> like<00:01:33.150> put<00:01:33.390> in<00:01:33.509> a

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
place so you could like put in a

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.060 
place so you could like put in a
substitute<00:01:34.079> either<00:01:34.259> instead<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.799> yarn

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
substitute either instead of the yarn

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.719 
substitute either instead of the yarn
and<00:01:35.570> but<00:01:36.619> it's<00:01:37.619> not<00:01:37.920> necessary<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.520> think

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
and but it's not necessary I think

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.090 
and but it's not necessary I think
you're<00:01:39.420> on<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.689> bare<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.880> yeah<00:01:41.880> that's<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:43.100> and

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
you're on is bare and yeah that's it and

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.620 
you're on is bare and yeah that's it and
so<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.460> hope<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.729> find<00:01:44.909> these<00:01:45.090> somewhat
