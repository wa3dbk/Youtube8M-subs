I've tells you from a CDM to it's just

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.420 
I've tells you from a CDM to it's just
an<00:01:48.780> hour<00:01:48.899> right<00:01:49.110> center<00:01:49.680> mid<00:01:49.890> because<00:01:50.159> I<00:01:50.250> feel

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
an hour right center mid because I feel

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.580 
an hour right center mid because I feel
because<00:01:50.820> he's<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:51.360> good<00:01:51.570> going<00:01:52.049> forward<00:01:52.320> and

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
because he's so good going forward and

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.530 
because he's so good going forward and
you<00:01:53.189> know<00:01:53.310> backwards<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:53.970> guess<00:01:54.149> technically

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
you know backwards I guess technically

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.319 
you know backwards I guess technically
but<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:55.470> know<00:01:55.590> his<00:01:55.920> stats<00:01:56.520> warrant<00:01:56.939> him<00:01:57.090> being

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
but you know his stats warrant him being

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.719 
but you know his stats warrant him being
a<00:01:57.479> cm<00:01:57.810> as<00:01:57.960> opposed<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.380> just<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.770> defensively

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
a cm as opposed to just a defensively

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.120 
a cm as opposed to just a defensively
minded<00:01:59.969> CDM<00:02:00.930> but<00:02:01.110> yeah<00:02:01.290> that's<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.649> ettore

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130

big<00:02:02.340> improvements<00:02:02.820> all-round<00:02:03.450> for<00:02:03.630> him

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
big improvements all-round for him

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.510 
big improvements all-round for him
personally<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.290> think<00:02:04.320> thoroughly<00:02:04.950> deserved

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
personally I think thoroughly deserved

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.540 
personally I think thoroughly deserved
we'll<00:02:05.850> look<00:02:05.969> at<00:02:06.439> Aguero<00:02:07.439> next<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.160> as<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.399> can

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
we'll look at Aguero next and as you can

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.360 
we'll look at Aguero next and as you can
see<00:02:08.580> I've<00:02:08.849> kept<00:02:09.119> him<00:02:09.270> at<00:02:09.479> 88<00:02:10.170> overall<00:02:10.800> but

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
see I've kept him at 88 overall but

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.100 
see I've kept him at 88 overall but
that's<00:02:11.700> not<00:02:11.910> without<00:02:12.150> changing<00:02:12.629> some<00:02:12.870> of<00:02:12.900> his

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
that's not without changing some of his

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.820 
that's not without changing some of his
individuals

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
individuals

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.440 
individuals
that's<00:02:13.980> his<00:02:14.190> pace<00:02:14.370> is<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.670> same<00:02:14.850> as<00:02:15.060> is<00:02:15.300> his

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
that's his pace is the same as is his

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.360 
that's his pace is the same as is his
defending<00:02:16.020> prob<00:02:16.380> up<00:02:16.590> tee<00:02:16.770> shot<00:02:17.040> by<00:02:17.190> one

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
defending prob up tee shot by one

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.640 
defending prob up tee shot by one
because<00:02:17.700> he's<00:02:17.910> just<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:18.330> goalscorer<00:02:19.230> every

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
because he's just a goalscorer every

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.320 
because he's just a goalscorer every
single<00:02:20.070> chance<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.490> go<00:02:20.580> ever<00:02:20.730> gets<00:02:20.970> easy<00:02:21.090> was

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
single chance to go ever gets easy was

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.370 
single chance to go ever gets easy was
to<00:02:21.390> put<00:02:21.540> into<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.780> back<00:02:21.930> of<00:02:21.960> the<00:02:22.110> net<00:02:22.230> is

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
to put into the back of the net is

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.290 
to put into the back of the net is
phenomenal<00:02:23.370> in<00:02:23.520> that<00:02:23.700> sense<00:02:23.970> I've<00:02:24.090> dropped

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
phenomenal in that sense I've dropped

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.270 
phenomenal in that sense I've dropped
his<00:02:24.510> passing<00:02:24.930> by<00:02:25.080> one<00:02:25.290> mainly<00:02:25.800> because<00:02:26.010> he

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
his passing by one mainly because he

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.130 
his passing by one mainly because he
seems<00:02:26.520> to<00:02:26.670> be<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.790> sort<00:02:27.120> of<00:02:27.180> player<00:02:27.390> that<00:02:27.630> just

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
seems to be the sort of player that just

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.290 
seems to be the sort of player that just
finished<00:02:28.830> his<00:02:29.100> chances<00:02:29.610> he<00:02:29.700> doesn't<00:02:30.000> he's<00:02:30.270> not

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
finished his chances he doesn't he's not

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.210 
finished his chances he doesn't he's not
involved<00:02:30.810> in<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.230> interlinking<00:02:31.800> passing

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
involved in the interlinking passing

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.430 
involved in the interlinking passing
he's<00:02:32.370> just<00:02:32.580> an<00:02:32.700> out-and-out<00:02:33.150> finish<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:33.930> real

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
he's just an out-and-out finish a real

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.660 
he's just an out-and-out finish a real
good<00:02:34.650> goalscorer<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.220> I've<00:02:35.400> upped<00:02:35.550> his

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
good goalscorer and I've upped his

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.010 
good goalscorer and I've upped his
dribbling<00:02:36.030> by<00:02:36.180> one<00:02:36.360> as<00:02:36.480> well<00:02:36.630> because<00:02:36.870> his

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
dribbling by one as well because his

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.750 
dribbling by one as well because his
touch<00:02:37.260> is<00:02:37.290> one<00:02:37.710> of<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:37.920> best<00:02:38.130> in<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.340> game<00:02:38.550> and

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
touch is one of the best in the game and

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.690 
touch is one of the best in the game and
he's<00:02:39.480> finishing<00:02:39.840> his<00:02:39.990> absolutely<00:02:40.950> deadly

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
he's finishing his absolutely deadly

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.670 
he's finishing his absolutely deadly
shot<00:02:42.210> could<00:02:42.420> quite<00:02:42.660> easily<00:02:42.690> go<00:02:43.140> up<00:02:43.290> by<00:02:43.470> more

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
shot could quite easily go up by more

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.320 
shot could quite easily go up by more
than<00:02:43.710> that<00:02:43.920> although<00:02:44.220> they<00:02:44.670> probably<00:02:44.700> won't

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
than that although they probably won't

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.570 
than that although they probably won't
do<00:02:45.600> something<00:02:46.050> like<00:02:46.500> that<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.770> his<00:02:47.130> card<00:02:47.400> but

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
do something like that to his card but

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.220 
do something like that to his card but
yeah<00:02:47.700> pace<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.150> say<00:02:48.330> well<00:02:48.510> that<00:02:48.630> could<00:02:48.810> quite

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
yeah pace to say well that could quite

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.110 
yeah pace to say well that could quite
possibly<00:02:49.260> go<00:02:49.770> either<00:02:49.920> up<00:02:50.160> or<00:02:50.370> down<00:02:50.430> he's<00:02:51.000> kind

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
possibly go either up or down he's kind

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.400 
possibly go either up or down he's kind
of<00:02:51.240> similar<00:02:51.420> to<00:02:51.570> Daniel<00:02:51.930> stories<00:02:52.230> that<00:02:52.350> we

of similar to Daniel stories that we

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.080 
of similar to Daniel stories that we
covered<00:02:52.680> yesterday<00:02:53.070> he<00:02:53.250> is<00:02:53.370> very<00:02:53.550> very<00:02:53.760> fast

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
covered yesterday he is very very fast

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.270 
covered yesterday he is very very fast
but<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:55.230> overall<00:02:55.530> stat<00:02:55.800> of<00:02:55.950> how<00:02:56.040> fast

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
but the the overall stat of how fast

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.920 
but the the overall stat of how fast
that<00:02:56.400> is<00:02:56.550> could<00:02:56.910> you<00:02:57.090> know<00:02:57.420> is<00:02:57.510> open<00:02:57.840> for

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
that is could you know is open for

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.320 
that is could you know is open for
interpretation<00:02:58.140> could<00:02:58.709> be<00:02:58.830> 87<00:02:59.190> could<00:02:59.820> be<00:02:59.970> 89

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
interpretation could be 87 could be 89

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.030 
interpretation could be 87 could be 89
I'm<00:03:00.630> not<00:03:00.750> really<00:03:00.870> too<00:03:01.080> sure<00:03:01.110> giving<00:03:01.530> him<00:03:01.650> 88

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
I'm not really too sure giving him 88

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.860 
I'm not really too sure giving him 88
and<00:03:02.190> just<00:03:02.310> kept<00:03:02.490> it<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:03.000> same<00:03:03.030> as<00:03:03.360> this<00:03:03.630> year

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
and just kept it the same as this year

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.900 
and just kept it the same as this year
but<00:03:04.020> he<00:03:04.170> is<00:03:04.320> just<00:03:04.620> an<00:03:04.830> out-and-out<00:03:05.310> goalscorer

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
but he is just an out-and-out goalscorer

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.600 
but he is just an out-and-out goalscorer
a<00:03:06.030> deadly<00:03:06.420> one-touch<00:03:06.990> finisher<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:07.650> that<00:03:08.430> is

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
a deadly one-touch finisher and that is

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.160
