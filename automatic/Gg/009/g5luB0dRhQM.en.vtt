00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.839
 It's a good night, people, I'll record one. 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:09.719
 video that quickly showing how the 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.550
 lumia 630 showing the new version of 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.960
 windows phone windows 10 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.100
 you can already see the difference that 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:22.710
 net notification the application icon 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:25.320
 is much greater when you learn to 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.869
 another huge difference from the old 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.830
 of the old version is that the background screen 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.829
 background is behind afternoons no 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.809
 is not even drawn in them, right? 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.940
 no longer has that black list or 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:45.660
 white depending on the background can not really 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:48.000
 camera open the applications folder 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.539
 the image is also in the bottom is more 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.539
 pretty 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.550
 then as a preview version and some 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.710
 bugs 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.250
 but nothing that makes your 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.299
 smartphone 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:11.180
 Because it's okay, it's so heavy, yes. 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.180
 notifications has changed a lot of 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:17.600
 You ran lots of options. 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:33.990
 how to expand also look at another big 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:36.479
 change is cute or you can pay for everything 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:44.759
 or post-conflict to see that same is 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:47.340
 another change is organized but as 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:54.890
 I was used to the other one. 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.890
 I was kind of lost here but there's nothing 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:06.750
 Another change is that I liked it. 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:11.450
 Geez, it was the photo gallery. 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:13.770
 the all- new look is more beautiful 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.220
 that I realized 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.350
 is that there is the and did not recognize 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.840
 still a thousand memory cards are 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:26.550
 problem on card or mobile phone I do not know 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:29.460
 But it 's still cool, I think. 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.500
 I want the system even because it told us 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.090
 albums say some salt will be 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.740
 available soon as they say that they 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.190
 go downloads 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.590
 according to the time for applications 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.810
 adapt better then the rest is just 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.540
 this after recording the other videos 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.960
 video with deeper information 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.960
 new system
