00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:08.066
This video will show the workflow between Maya 
and Guerilla.

00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:19.066
First, let's load the Guerilla plug-in..

00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:25.033
A 'Guerilla' menu must show up

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.066
This scene include a light, shaders, animated 
objects and deformed objects

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.066
Let's export all that to Guerilla

00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:45.066
During the first export, the plug-in ask you 
to choose your Guerilla project

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
After the exportation, Guerilla pops up with 
the project

00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:58.000
The light, the shaders, the camera, the 
objects, the animations the deformation have 
been exported

00:00:59.033 --> 00:01:03.033
Now, let's start the rendering work in 
Guerilla..

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
We save the project and quit

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:38.033
Back in Maya, we want now to modify the 
modeling and the animation of this scene.

00:01:42.033 --> 00:01:50.000
The default export mode is "Merge", it means 
that the work already done in Guerilla will be 
merged with the updaped data from Maya.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.066
Let's re-export the scene to Guerilla.

00:01:59.066 --> 00:02:11.033
The geometry and the animation have been 
merged with the Guerilla modifications.

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:36.066
Another export mode is "Replace". It will re-
create a clean Guerilla project at each 
export.

00:02:38.033 --> 00:02:42.033
Back in Maya, let's see some details

00:02:42.033 --> 00:02:47.000
After the first export, the plug-in creates a 
GuerillaNode.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
This node contains the path to the Guerilla 
project.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.066
Don't forget to delete this node when you 
duplicate your Maya file.

00:03:05.066 --> 00:03:17.066
Let's load our project as a reference in Maya.

00:03:19.033 --> 00:03:38.066
We modify a little bit the scene and we export 
it.

00:03:39.033 --> 00:03:46.000
This is a new Maya file, so we need a new 
Guerilla file

00:03:48.033 --> 00:03:57.000
In Guerilla, the file also references the base 
Guerilla project

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:08.033
So, you can continue to use the references 
with Guerilla. Just make sure that every Maya 
file has its own Guerilla file

00:04:14.033 --> 00:04:22.033
You can add tags to your object in Maya to 
control the export process

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.066
The 'Export' tag controls if an object and all its 
children must be exported

00:04:29.066 --> 00:04:33.000
The 'Bake geometry' tag control how precise the 
baking of an object must be

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.033
'Rigid' to bake the geometry only once

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.066
'Deform' to bake the vertices at each frame

00:04:37.066 --> 00:04:39.000
'Full deform' to bake everything at each frame

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
'Motion Blur Steps' controls how many samples 
per frame are needed for the motion blur

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.033
Default is 1. Guerilla is able to generate 3D 
motion blur with only one sample
