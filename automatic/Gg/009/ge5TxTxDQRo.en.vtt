internal inside this hub and supposedly
that<00:00:45.930> makes<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.320> much<00:00:46.949> more<00:00:47.220> reliable<00:00:47.550> than

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.080 
that makes it much more reliable than

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.250 
that makes it much more reliable than
system<00:00:49.080> with<00:00:49.290> the<00:00:49.500> derailleur<00:00:51.019> modern<00:00:52.019> type

system but I didn't really get it for
that<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.739> got<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.400> because<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.879> was<00:00:56.910> only
