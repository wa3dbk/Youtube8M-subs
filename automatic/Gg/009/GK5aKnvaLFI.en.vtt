00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.249 
then with a smaller cookie cutter that
we<00:01:56.579> can<00:01:56.790> find<00:01:57.119> we<00:01:57.360> are<00:01:57.420> going<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.810> make<00:01:58.020> a

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
we can find we are going to make a

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.310 
we can find we are going to make a
circle<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:58.920> place<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.579> right<00:01:59.880> there<00:02:00.079> then<00:02:01.079> we

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
circle and place it right there then we

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.050 
circle and place it right there then we
are<00:02:01.380> going<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.710> make<00:02:01.829> another<00:02:02.219> one<00:02:02.549> but<00:02:02.880> this

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
are going to make another one but this

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.120 
are going to make another one but this
time<00:02:03.329> has<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.780> be<00:02:03.810> thicker<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.350> then<00:02:04.799> we<00:02:05.070> are

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
time has to be thicker and then we are

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.160 
time has to be thicker and then we are
going<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.430> press<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:05.939> down<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.390> make<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:07.079> a

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
going to press it down and make it a

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.589 
going to press it down and make it a
little<00:02:07.320> bit<00:02:07.590> larger<00:02:08.129> so<00:02:08.369> then<00:02:09.000> we<00:02:09.270> are<00:02:09.330> going

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
little bit larger so then we are going

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.260 
little bit larger so then we are going
to<00:02:09.720> make<00:02:09.899> these<00:02:10.259> invitations<00:02:10.860> with<00:02:11.760> em<00:02:12.000> each
