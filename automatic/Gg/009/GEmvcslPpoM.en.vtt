00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.129 

first<00:00:12.210> let's<00:00:12.389> take<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.570> look<00:00:12.780> at<00:00:12.870> our<00:00:12.960> brew

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
first let's take a look at our brew

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.480 
first let's take a look at our brew
process<00:00:13.710> what<00:00:14.639> we<00:00:14.790> do<00:00:15.000> here<00:00:15.360> is<00:00:15.480> we<00:00:15.509> start<00:00:15.960> with

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.490 
process what we do here is we start with

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.779 
process what we do here is we start with
hot<00:00:17.490> water<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.420> then<00:00:18.840> we<00:00:18.990> add<00:00:19.340> crushed<00:00:20.340> malted

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
hot water and then we add crushed malted

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.880 
hot water and then we add crushed malted
barley<00:00:20.939> in<00:00:21.300> our<00:00:21.420> mash<00:00:21.660> tun<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.289> let<00:00:22.439> it<00:00:22.560> steep

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
barley in our mash tun to let it steep

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.160 
barley in our mash tun to let it steep
as<00:00:23.670> you<00:00:23.850> know<00:00:24.000> this<00:00:24.240> process<00:00:24.779> is<00:00:24.990> the

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
as you know this process is the

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.050 
as you know this process is the
conversion<00:00:25.500> process<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:26.580> converting<00:00:26.849> the

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
conversion process of converting the

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.630 
conversion process of converting the
starches<00:00:27.599> in<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.900> malted<00:00:28.230> barley<00:00:28.640> to

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
starches in the malted barley to

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.790 
starches in the malted barley to
fermentable<00:00:30.090> sugars<00:00:30.539> we<00:00:31.230> use<00:00:31.439> pre-ground

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
fermentable sugars we use pre-ground

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.569 
fermentable sugars we use pre-ground
crushed

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
crushed

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.270 
crushed
Riis<00:00:32.880> malt<00:00:33.239> that<00:00:33.540> way<00:00:34.020> we<00:00:34.140> don't<00:00:34.260> have<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.680> mill

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
Riis malt that way we don't have to mill

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.100 
Riis malt that way we don't have to mill
it<00:00:35.309> ourselves<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.540> can<00:00:36.690> save<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:36.899> lot<00:00:37.050> of

where we take the top off and this

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.719 
where we take the top off and this
allows<00:01:21.810> us<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.080> inspect<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.710> work<00:01:22.890> before<00:01:23.670> it

during<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.060> boil<00:01:30.770> we<00:01:31.770> will<00:01:31.799> add<00:01:32.070> hops<00:01:32.460> or<00:01:32.850> four

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
during the boil we will add hops or four

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.020 
during the boil we will add hops or four
bittering<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.439> then<00:01:34.950> at<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.610> end<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.939> the

bittering and then at the end of the
boil<00:01:36.329> we'll<00:01:36.450> add<00:01:36.630> hops<00:01:36.960> or<00:01:37.320> flavor

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050

this<00:01:39.590> whole<00:01:39.800> process<00:01:40.430> like<00:01:40.640> I<00:01:40.730> said<00:01:40.760> takes

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
this whole process like I said takes

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.670 
this whole process like I said takes
about<00:01:41.240> an<00:01:41.420> hour<00:01:41.540> and<00:01:41.720> a<00:01:41.750> half<00:01:41.960> at<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.260> end<00:01:42.500> of

about an hour and a half at the end of
which<00:01:43.220> time<00:01:43.250> we<00:01:44.120> will<00:01:44.270> whirlpool<00:01:44.780> the<00:01:44.990> cattle

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
which time we will whirlpool the cattle

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.290 
which time we will whirlpool the cattle
what<00:01:45.950> that<00:01:46.100> will<00:01:46.220> do<00:01:46.340> is<00:01:46.370> that<00:01:46.520> will<00:01:46.760> take<00:01:46.970> all

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
what that will do is that will take all

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.810 
what that will do is that will take all
the<00:01:47.480> hops<00:01:47.690> and<00:01:48.020> troub<00:01:48.680> which<00:01:49.010> are<00:01:49.220> a<00:01:49.340> protein

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
not pull this out into our fermenter

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.640 
not pull this out into our fermenter
we'll<00:01:56.450> go<00:01:56.570> to<00:01:56.660> the<00:01:56.780> center<00:01:57.080> drop<00:01:57.350> to<00:01:57.560> the
