00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.230 
finished off academia 500 AF and more
importantly<00:00:07.890> we<00:00:08.189> fully<00:00:08.460> explored<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.210> area

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
importantly we fully explored the area

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.680 
importantly we fully explored the area
and<00:00:09.840> academia<00:00:10.679> 500<00:00:11.519> is<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.730> final<00:00:12.269> area<00:00:12.420> we

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
and academia 500 is the final area we

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.140 
and academia 500 is the final area we
need<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:12.960> have<00:00:13.110> fully<00:00:13.290> explored<00:00:13.830> so<00:00:14.700> hopefully

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
need to have fully explored so hopefully

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.519 
need to have fully explored so hopefully
you've<00:00:15.269> done<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.570> rest<00:00:15.750> but<00:00:16.020> I'm<00:00:16.139> going<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.410> go

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
through the maps now to explain which

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.019 
through the maps now to explain which
ones<00:00:19.289> you<00:00:19.410> need<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.710> do<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.100> then<00:00:20.699> we<00:00:20.789> can<00:00:20.910> go

there as well in order to get a hundred

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.520 
there as well in order to get a hundred
percent<00:02:23.090> accademia<00:02:24.090> next<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.720> you<00:02:25.260> need<00:02:25.410> to

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
percent accademia next and you need to

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.740 
percent accademia next and you need to
explore<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.280> five<00:02:26.550> hundred<00:02:26.880> AF<00:02:27.060> version<00:02:27.600> and

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
explore the five hundred AF version and

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.600 
explore the five hundred AF version and
also<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:29.690> four<00:02:30.690> double<00:02:31.020> xaf<00:02:31.470> version<00:02:32.040> you<00:02:32.370> can

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
also the four double xaf version you can

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.210 
also the four double xaf version you can
do<00:02:32.790> it<00:02:32.910> by<00:02:33.030> doing<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.420> 400<00:02:33.900> af<00:02:34.170> but<00:02:34.830> there's<00:02:35.010> so

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
do it by doing the 400 af but there's so

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.040 
do it by doing the 400 af but there's so
many<00:02:35.370> CF<00:02:35.790> that<00:02:35.970> spawn<00:02:36.210> all<00:02:36.360> over<00:02:36.570> the<00:02:36.690> place<00:02:36.870> I

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
many CF that spawn all over the place I

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.870 
many CF that spawn all over the place I
wouldn't<00:02:37.260> even<00:02:37.350> bother<00:02:37.590> so<00:02:38.280> go<00:02:38.550> to<00:02:38.610> four

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
wouldn't even bother so go to four

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.510 
wouldn't even bother so go to four
double<00:02:39.180> X<00:02:39.330> and<00:02:39.570> five<00:02:39.750> hundreds<00:02:40.320> and<00:02:40.500> in<00:02:41.220> for

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
double X and five hundreds and in for

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.130 
double X and five hundreds and in for
double<00:02:41.820> X<00:02:41.970> make<00:02:42.180> sure<00:02:42.390> you<00:02:42.540> go<00:02:42.660> into<00:02:42.870> all<00:02:43.020> the

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
double X make sure you go into all the

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.530 
double X make sure you go into all the
shops<00:02:43.410> and<00:02:43.820> whatnot<00:02:44.820> to<00:02:45.030> get<00:02:45.240> every<00:02:45.450> little

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
shops and whatnot to get every little

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.950 
shops and whatnot to get every little
part<00:02:45.870> there<00:02:45.960> because<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:47.010> tower<00:02:47.250> is<00:02:47.550> a<00:02:48.360> little

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
part there because the tower is a little

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.180 
part there because the tower is a little
bit<00:02:49.080> tricky<00:02:49.380> so<00:02:49.530> you<00:02:49.560> might<00:02:49.830> want<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.070> follow

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
bit tricky so you might want to follow

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.970 
bit tricky so you might want to follow
the<00:02:50.400> walk<00:02:50.580> through<00:02:50.910> and<00:02:51.350> see<00:02:52.350> where<00:02:52.650> all<00:02:52.680> the

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
the walk through and see where all the

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.400 
the walk through and see where all the
parts<00:02:53.310> are<00:02:53.520> for<00:02:53.670> that<00:02:53.850> you<00:02:54.600> do<00:02:54.780> need<00:02:54.960> to<00:02:55.110> get

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
parts are for that you do need to get

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.360 
parts are for that you do need to get
100%<00:02:55.740> on<00:02:56.310> 200<00:02:56.940> AF<00:02:57.210> and<00:02:57.450> 300<00:02:57.990> and<00:02:58.080> 300<00:02:58.920> AF<00:02:59.190> they

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
100% on 200 AF and 300 and 300 AF they

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.740 
100% on 200 AF and 300 and 300 AF they
are<00:02:59.550> two<00:02:59.700> different<00:02:59.880> Maps<00:03:00.210> and<00:03:00.510> you<00:03:00.570> need<00:03:00.720> both

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
are two different Maps and you need both

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.740 
are two different Maps and you need both
and<00:03:01.700> after<00:03:02.700> you've<00:03:02.850> completed<00:03:02.970> all<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.510> store

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
and after you've completed all the store

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.200 
and after you've completed all the store
where<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:03.990> get<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.260> access<00:03:04.590> key<00:03:04.800> 13<00:03:05.370> so<00:03:05.910> go<00:03:06.150> to

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
where you get the access key 13 so go to

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.600 
where you get the access key 13 so go to
floor<00:03:06.450> 13<00:03:06.960> to<00:03:07.140> finish<00:03:07.410> off<00:03:07.620> to<00:03:08.430> get<00:03:08.490> your

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
floor 13 to finish off to get your

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.420 
floor 13 to finish off to get your
hundred-percent<00:03:09.090> there<00:03:09.950> okay<00:03:10.950> next<00:03:11.190> we<00:03:11.400> have

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
hundred-percent there okay next we have

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.340 
hundred-percent there okay next we have
vial<00:03:11.790> Peaks<00:03:12.150> which<00:03:12.390> is<00:03:12.510> an<00:03:12.630> easy<00:03:12.780> one<00:03:13.080> but<00:03:13.260> you

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
vial Peaks which is an easy one but you

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.970 
vial Peaks which is an easy one but you
can<00:03:13.470> only<00:03:13.620> do<00:03:13.920> it<00:03:14.040> in<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.340> ten<00:03:14.550> AF<00:03:14.820> version

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
can only do it in the ten AF version

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.350 
can only do it in the ten AF version
then<00:03:16.980> we<00:03:17.130> have<00:03:17.280> a<00:03:17.310> dying<00:03:17.670> world<00:03:17.850> which<00:03:18.240> is

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
then we have a dying world which is

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.120 
then we have a dying world which is
another<00:03:18.570> easy<00:03:18.810> one<00:03:19.110> or<00:03:19.350> they<00:03:19.470> can<00:03:19.680> only<00:03:19.800> do<00:03:20.010> it

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
another easy one or they can only do it

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.860 
another easy one or they can only do it
once<00:03:20.490> you<00:03:20.610> return<00:03:20.880> there<00:03:21.210> from<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:21.630> fully

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
once you return there from the fully

and this here is the MPC by the computer
terminal<00:04:17.590> you<00:04:18.590> have<00:04:18.620> to<00:04:18.799> speak<00:04:19.040> to<00:04:19.070> every<00:04:19.489> time

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
to hand in each map and then you get a

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.870 
to hand in each map and then you get a
fragment<00:04:23.650> so<00:04:24.650> I'll<00:04:25.280> just<00:04:25.460> show<00:04:25.580> you<00:04:25.610> on<00:04:25.790> the

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
fragment so I'll just show you on the

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.820 
fragment so I'll just show you on the
map<00:04:26.060> where<00:04:26.450> about<00:04:26.660> cities<00:04:27.080> in<00:04:27.470> case<00:04:27.710> you

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
map where about cities in case you

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.140 
map where about cities in case you
forgot<00:04:28.070> them<00:04:30.550> so<00:04:31.550> obviously<00:04:31.820> there's<00:04:31.970> ten

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
forgot them so obviously there's ten

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.420 
forgot them so obviously there's ten
maps<00:04:32.389> to<00:04:32.570> handy<00:04:32.930> and<00:04:33.260> you<00:04:33.950> have<00:04:34.070> to<00:04:34.190> do<00:04:34.280> them

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
maps to handy and you have to do them

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.950 
maps to handy and you have to do them
one<00:04:34.520> at<00:04:34.580> a<00:04:34.730> time<00:04:34.760> you<00:04:35.090> get<00:04:35.180> a<00:04:35.210> little<00:04:35.270> bit<00:04:35.480> of<00:04:35.600> CP

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
one at a time you get a little bit of CP

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:43.720 
one at a time you get a little bit of CP
as<00:04:36.080> well<00:04:36.260> which<00:04:36.440> is<00:04:36.560> always<00:04:36.710> a<00:04:36.889> bonus<00:04:40.810> and<00:04:42.730> the

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
as well which is always a bonus and the

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.909 
as well which is always a bonus and the
main<00:04:44.660> reason<00:04:45.020> we're<00:04:45.139> doing<00:04:45.260> this<00:04:45.500> apart<00:04:45.889> from

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
main reason we're doing this apart from

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:47.740 
main reason we're doing this apart from
the<00:04:46.070> fragments<00:04:46.610> is<00:04:47.060> that<00:04:47.300> we<00:04:47.419> can<00:04:47.600> then

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
the fragments is that we can then

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.810 
the fragments is that we can then
collect<00:04:48.020> a<00:04:48.380> very<00:04:48.650> useful<00:04:48.860> fragment<00:04:49.580> skill

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
collect a very useful fragment skill

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.030 
collect a very useful fragment skill
once<00:04:50.090> all<00:04:50.270> eleven<00:04:50.660> are<00:04:50.720> handed<00:04:50.990> in<00:04:51.139> over<00:04:51.889> in

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.040

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
so I highly recommend we do do this side

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:01.240 
so I highly recommend we do do this side

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
for doing it is very good so that alone

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.550 
for doing it is very good so that alone
