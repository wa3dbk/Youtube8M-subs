in<00:03:02.130> a<00:03:02.220> nutshell<00:03:02.630> installation<00:03:03.630> is<00:03:03.750> pretty

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
in a nutshell installation is pretty

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.590 
in a nutshell installation is pretty
much<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.470> reversal<00:03:04.950> it<00:03:05.069> was<00:03:05.280> now<00:03:06.090> there<00:03:06.269> is<00:03:06.389> an

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
much the reversal it was now there is an

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.539 
much the reversal it was now there is an
adjustable<00:03:07.200> heim<00:03:07.530> joint<00:03:07.859> on<00:03:08.069> this<00:03:08.280> which<00:03:08.459> I

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
adjustable heim joint on this which I

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.940 
adjustable heim joint on this which I
kind<00:03:08.790> of<00:03:08.850> like<00:03:09.530> gives<00:03:10.530> a<00:03:10.560> little<00:03:10.739> bit<00:03:10.889> more

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
kind of like gives a little bit more

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.830 
kind of like gives a little bit more
movement<00:03:11.310> there's<00:03:12.000> no<00:03:12.120> rubber<00:03:12.299> bushing<00:03:12.720> in

I'm not gonna tighten everything up
right<00:03:23.230> from<00:03:23.500> the<00:03:23.590> start<00:03:23.800> because<00:03:24.040> you<00:03:24.400> know

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
right from the start because you know

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.400

some<00:03:25.390> of<00:03:25.480> these<00:03:25.540> things<00:03:25.750> are<00:03:25.930> a<00:03:25.960> little<00:03:26.140> tricky

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
some of these things are a little tricky

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.960 
some of these things are a little tricky
to<00:03:26.440> get<00:03:26.590> in<00:03:26.740> a<00:03:26.800> place<00:03:27.010> if<00:03:27.220> they're<00:03:27.340> all<00:03:27.460> really

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
to get in a place if they're all really

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.840 
to get in a place if they're all really
tight<00:03:28.240> so<00:03:28.750> I'm<00:03:28.930> just<00:03:29.080> gonna<00:03:29.170> pop<00:03:29.470> them<00:03:29.650> in

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
tight so I'm just gonna pop them in

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.630 
tight so I'm just gonna pop them in
there<00:03:30.850> nuts<00:03:31.090> on<00:03:32.280> then<00:03:33.280> I'll<00:03:33.400> tighten

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
there nuts on then I'll tighten

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.560 
there nuts on then I'll tighten
everything<00:03:33.790> up<00:03:34.090> when<00:03:34.240> everything's

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:16.300 
much longer but that's because at the

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.520 
much longer but that's because at the
end<00:04:16.330> of<00:04:16.480> the<00:04:16.570> trailing<00:04:16.780> arm<00:04:16.989> it<00:04:17.170> was<00:04:17.260> a<00:04:17.320> lot

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530

thicker<00:04:17.739> so<00:04:18.640> I<00:04:18.670> just<00:04:18.910> had<00:04:19.060> to<00:04:19.180> go<00:04:19.300> in<00:04:19.390> and<00:04:19.480> get

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
thicker so I just had to go in and get

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:27.780 
thicker so I just had to go in and get
myself<00:04:19.720> a<00:04:20.020> new<00:04:20.170> bolt<00:04:26.100> this<00:04:27.100> still<00:04:27.370> might<00:04:27.550> seem
