with such a tricky States at icy stage
that<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:48.989> think<00:00:49.469> it's<00:00:49.589> the<00:00:49.769> iciest<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.730> stage<00:00:51.420> I

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
that I think it's the iciest the stage I

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.840 
that I think it's the iciest the stage I
ever<00:00:51.809> drove<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.350> was<00:00:52.620> very<00:00:52.890> very<00:00:53.699> very

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
ever drove it was very very very

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.020 
ever drove it was very very very
slippery<00:00:54.359> so<00:00:55.289> not<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.309> best<00:00:56.519> to<00:00:56.730> find<00:00:56.909> the

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
slippery so not the best to find the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.270 
slippery so not the best to find the
confidence<00:00:57.269> meeting<00:00:57.780> but<00:00:58.079> we<00:00:58.469> made<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.129> and

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
confidence meeting but we made it and

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.420 
confidence meeting but we made it and
now<00:00:59.670> we<00:00:59.729> the<00:01:00.269> race<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.719> good<00:01:01.710> on<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.890> way<00:01:02.100> but

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
now we the race is a good on the way but

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.509 
now we the race is a good on the way but
for<00:01:02.579> sure<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:03.299> lot<00:01:04.289> of<00:01:04.409> surprises<00:01:04.920> are<00:01:05.100> still<00:01:05.399> in

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
for sure a lot of surprises are still in

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:27.850 
for sure a lot of surprises are still in
front<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.789> us

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.340 

the<00:01:28.250> second<00:01:28.700> position<00:01:29.090> is<00:01:29.240> a<00:01:29.480> lot<00:01:30.050> better<00:01:30.200> than

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
the second position is a lot better than

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.100 
the second position is a lot better than
I<00:01:30.620> thought<00:01:30.650> so<00:01:31.190> now<00:01:32.000> the<00:01:32.060> main<00:01:32.390> game<00:01:32.600> is<00:01:32.630> to

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
I thought so now the main game is to

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.730 
I thought so now the main game is to
hold<00:01:33.650> it<00:01:33.860> and<00:01:34.040> to<00:01:34.340> keep<00:01:34.460> this<00:01:34.640> position<00:01:34.880> and

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
hold it and to keep this position and

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.140 
hold it and to keep this position and
Sheroes<00:01:36.740> here<00:01:36.950> is<00:01:37.130> he<00:01:37.340> is<00:01:37.400> flying<00:01:37.640> I<00:01:37.880> have<00:01:38.000> no

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
Sheroes here is he is flying I have no

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.210 
Sheroes here is he is flying I have no
chance<00:01:38.390> to<00:01:38.540> that<00:01:38.900> kind<00:01:39.110> of<00:01:39.170> speed<00:01:39.440> and<00:01:39.590> but

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
chance to that kind of speed and but

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.880 
chance to that kind of speed and but
that's<00:01:40.400> my<00:01:41.030> target<00:01:41.300> either<00:01:41.600> so<00:01:42.050> if<00:01:42.500> I<00:01:42.620> can<00:01:42.770> give

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
that's my target either so if I can give

00:01:42.890 --> 00:02:23.559 
that's my target either so if I can give
and<00:01:43.070> rest<00:01:43.280> behind<00:01:43.550> that's<00:01:43.700> good

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569
