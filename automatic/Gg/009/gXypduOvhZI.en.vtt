00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello to all haste to the polo 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.180
 today we find ourselves on flapi 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.740
 kraft then I make you a video there 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.800
 because it stays in the world of 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.380
 minecraft universe of our chain and I 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.990
 wanted to make a small presentation of 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.990
 this game because it is not very well known 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.900
 still as you can see 1966 ago 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.970
 who does not know it's not a lot 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.810
 so it's exactly the same concept 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.490
 that flapi baird 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.330
 but it's a little bit more 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.920
 difficult because you see that the skin is 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.170
 really taller than the bird in 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.290
 flapi bird and that for example when you 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.399
 have passed 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.730
 finally when you went between two 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.379
 tubing 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.850
 you still have the feet of the skins 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.200
 who can touch the barbecue they will you 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.829
 to lose then there we will make 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.230
 small tests 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.670
 so here you see these islands being the 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.140
 same Swiss technique the sets that 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.329
 is not the same 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.399
 it's the decor of minecraft so there we 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.550
 will try to make 20 more than 20 points 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.370
 which is a score that was made by 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.370
 our target brethren it's obviously with 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.470
 me here they could not then we 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.080
 you passed between the pipe so it's 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.330
 pipes captures us here finally catching 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.490
 as in minecraft 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:16.950
 you have a decor the other banshee and 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.150
 it is then lalanne at the jetty 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.640
 to break the record I did not have you that 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.360
 their body waiting was waiting yes yes 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.909
 Yes 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.729
 1 I had seen the you saw the ring 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.869
 you have look there there was a 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.570
 space to you there may be some 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.970
 bugs as you see everything there was a 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.939
 canton area the skins and the pipe is 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.470
 there it made me spit and I lost 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.579
 but there may be some bugs 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.049
 like that so that's why I want you 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.659
 advises first had to play flat publishes 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.850
 games pretty much like that with 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.890
 little characters because remember 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.579
 this one pardon is quite difficult in 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:55.079
 more bugs 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:56.969
 you can have of course then I 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.860
 you say that the next call for 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.350
 next video dpi is to do 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.250
 from hunger games I do not know there are 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.250
 more at the germany layer
