insecticide<00:00:27.359> on<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.689> scene<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:28.830> what<00:00:28.980> we're

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
insecticide on the scene so what we're

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.740 
insecticide on the scene so what we're
going<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.279> do<00:00:29.429> here<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:29.760> pull<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.119> soil<00:00:30.480> sample

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
going to do here is pull a soil sample

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.650 
going to do here is pull a soil sample
to<00:00:31.529> check<00:00:31.769> for<00:00:32.040> half<00:00:32.550> screen<00:00:33.090> for<00:00:33.390> nematodes

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
to check for half screen for nematodes

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.170 
to check for half screen for nematodes
we're<00:00:34.649> going<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:34.800> use<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:34.980> regular<00:00:35.399> soil<00:00:35.880> probe

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
we're going to use a regular soil probe

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.810 
we're going to use a regular soil probe
to<00:00:36.390> do<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.750> when<00:00:37.500> we<00:00:37.649> probe<00:00:37.980> we're<00:00:38.640> going<00:00:38.760> to

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
to do that when we probe we're going to

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.479 
to do that when we probe we're going to
measure<00:00:39.780> off<00:00:40.110> around<00:00:40.530> four<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.070> six<00:00:41.309> inches

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
measure off around four to six inches

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.450 
measure off around four to six inches
from<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.629> base<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.140> plant<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.710> then

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
from the base of the plant and then

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.880 
from the base of the plant and then
bring<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.879> probe<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.420> at<00:00:45.690> about<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.079> 45<00:00:46.680> degree

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
bring the probe in at about a 45 degree

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.959 
bring the probe in at about a 45 degree
angle<00:00:47.930> so<00:00:48.930> we're<00:00:49.050> approximately<00:00:49.640> four<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.670> six

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
angle so we're approximately four to six

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.180 
angle so we're approximately four to six
inches<00:00:51.120> away<00:00:51.449> get<00:00:52.079> our<00:00:52.170> probe<00:00:52.440> at<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.649> 45<00:00:53.160> degree

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
inches away get our probe at a 45 degree

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.850 
inches away get our probe at a 45 degree
angle<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.149> probe<00:00:54.809> rate<00:00:55.110> down<00:00:55.320> through<00:00:55.680> that

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
angle and probe rate down through that

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.959 
angle and probe rate down through that
rut<00:00:56.129> zone<00:00:57.170> pull<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.320> up<00:00:58.500> check<00:00:59.190> my<00:00:59.370> core<00:00:59.609> we're

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.450 
inch deep sample I'm going to go ahead
and<00:01:06.659> dump<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:07.049> in<00:01:07.229> our<00:01:07.320> bag<00:01:07.560> we're<00:01:08.280> going<00:01:08.369> to

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
and dump that in our bag we're going to

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.969 
and dump that in our bag we're going to
go<00:01:08.670> ahead<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:09.000> pull<00:01:09.479> about<00:01:09.720> ten<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.170> these<00:01:10.260> in

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
go ahead and pull about ten of these in

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.679 
go ahead and pull about ten of these in
a<00:01:11.100> relatively<00:01:11.580> small<00:01:11.760> area<00:01:12.170> within<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.380> plot

a relatively small area within the plot

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.060 
a relatively small area within the plot
so<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:15.840> we<00:01:15.930> don't<00:01:16.020> get<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.229> lot<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.439> variation

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
so that we don't get a lot of variation

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.070 
so that we don't get a lot of variation
or<00:01:17.189> variability<00:01:17.729> of<00:01:18.180> course<00:01:18.720> we'll<00:01:18.900> pull
