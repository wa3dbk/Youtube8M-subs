 Sunday and today we will talk about 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.609
 roleplay

 so I will not make you the insult of 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.330
 explain what role play is 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.469
 it's something so widespread of our 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.030
 days in practice even during 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.769
 job interviews 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.450
 we will put ourselves in situation now 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.170
 I am a customer you are the 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.730
 receptionist 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.520
 I'm going down to see you what I'm not 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.170
 satisfied by my room you are there 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.519
 we do not create a personal file first the 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.050
 faucet leaks the bedside table is 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.800
 rickety and for the TV I even find 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.730
 not the remote 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.199
 I'm suing them no I'm a 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.890
 chaotic receptionist bad the game 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.600
 soul I attack 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.399
 it's a scandal they require a 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.260
 best high school room in a city tone 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.870
 to attach to the gloves you will feel the 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.190
 taste of the dark metal moon the fags 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.870
 Nordic will make you spend the taste of 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.469
 complain 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.469
 the Nordic countries 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.780
 indeed there are two kinds of video games 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.110
 those who understand a share of 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.550
 roleplay and the others we're not going 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.960
 here review all the games that 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.000
 we qualify for ease of play 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.560
 role or rpg and for a long time besides that 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.210
 the nomenclatures have refined that 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.360
 we talk about jrpg for productions 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.380
 Japanese and 2.6 rpg computer rpg for 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.380
 Western games 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.070
 we're going to talk here about a state 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.720
 particular of the game make the roleplay 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.610
 it is truly embodying one's 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.990
 character make his own story 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.590
 interpret his reactions according to 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.119
 his character 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.290
 so many particular traits that 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.900
 hold more of the game as we understand it 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.190
 in the theater the actor's play that game 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.920
 designed as a set of rules and 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.570
 dangerous every game or almost us 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.159
 asks to embody a character but he 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.409
 is rarely a question of penetrating 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.149
 his psychology and make it his 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.530
 whore they come the goal and he is there 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:48.610
 I'm behind the basilica wall kills 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.350
 for the little pan in motion 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.000
 how do you want you are dead and why 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.619
 any age are you there dead you my friend 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.270
 you my companion in arms 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.280
 we are so many things together and 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.840
 we felt the tension dallaire you 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.539
 behind 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:05.759
 ab am dead to me I die I withers 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:05.759
 to hard live you the life of a soldier 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.920
 some people think that it is 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.450
 easier to immerse yourself in a frame 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.489
 narrative and in a character when 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.310
 one is alone it is valid for rpg 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.780
 and for survival horror yes but the 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.700
 multi it sells copies 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.140
 it turns the game into social practice 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.640
 and his strength the players to use a 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.040
 official version to be able to 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.880
 connect to the devil the thrill provided 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.320
 we sell patties 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.570
 as we say in the winter markets 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.829
 bretons and yet their pl is 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.810
 basically something we do 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:36.940
 with people the roleplay is a 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.050
 value which is beyond the 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.580
 gameplay and game system 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.230
 do we understand well the role play 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.300
 paper's ambition was to simulate 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.160
 through the rules and environment 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.020
 interactions what is IT doing 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.340
 wonderfully but better than a master of 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.990
 game still likely to crash 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.330
 in the dice rolls the calculations and the 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.500
 reading the tables the con but this 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.360
 set of rules were there only 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.860
 as a basis for the role play at 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.580
 properly speaking and did not constitute 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.440
 an end in itself 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.000
 only here is in place and the master of 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:06.800
 game by a computer there is no rest 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.210
 almost more than the game system by 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.650
 example it is quite possible to 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.950
 play roleplay at world of warcraft for 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.840
 any mmorpg here I knight 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.120
 I am lost in these wild lands that 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.770
 would you say differ with me a bit of 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:24.200
 way at least until next 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:28.870
 village that is what says lol set was 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:30.400
 noob state of ific 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.080
 we can see here that what was 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.879
 that a support to live from 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.799
 rich and thrilling vicissitudes of 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:37.870
 human adventures turned into 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.190
 Beast loot and xp game do we ask 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.260
 no more investments remember that 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.760
 that in the jargon gamers we call that 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.500
 of the monster treasure door 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.000
 it's the mark of the very bad masters 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.920
 of the game some have tried bravely 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.569
 to integrate this beyond the game this 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.819
 freedom of interpretation of the character 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.260
 in the very system of the ultima game 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:57.489
 until mass effect we offered to 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.370
 players the opportunity to choose a 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:02.410
 moral orientation for his avatar you 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.609
 always have the choice to shepard 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.230
 if you do not find by the evidence that 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:07.180
 we both seek the way 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.250
 will always be able to separate but 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.019
 first go on freedom this progresses 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.239
 these decisions had consequences 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.950
 in terms of narration gameplay but 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.570
 everyone will understand that it is difficult to 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.250
 plan to anticipate everything that the 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.370
 player might want to do and so 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.479
 that this system has limitations 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.699
 to be able to choose between conciliatory 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:26.620
 pragmatic or a little bit of both 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:27.610
 light compared absolute freedom power 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.380
 tell the masters of the game that we want 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.229
 remove his pants and pee on 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.430
 the krogan chief's head so some 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:34.990
 games had the idea of ​​offering players 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.090
 tools to be able to embody the 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.500
 master of the game that one is then free 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.300
 to make the NPC talk by taking 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.590
 possession 2 to make them act and react 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.300
 what players could have 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.130
 want to do and of course to place him 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.900
 even monsters rewards etc 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.970
 this is the case for example of vampire the 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.330
 masquerade a game adapted from a real game 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.330
 paper role 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.030
 they actually find that this 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.139
 practice remained very marginal as 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.669
 if it interested only those who 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.039
 had had the pleasure of knowing the 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:01.210
 joy of throwing dice with friends we saw 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:02.800
 that the roleplay dimension tended 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.120
 to fade against the game mechanics 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.750
 therefore content to transpose it into 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.490
 the video game 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.110
 that would mean that for the 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.190
 players focus on the play role 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.720
 and social interactions 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.759
 the gaming system should know 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.289
 soften as when vampire puts it 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:17.889
 in the hands of the mj or more 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:19.570
 radically disappear and this is in 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:21.039
 big what did second life a game 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.840
 without rule of the game only based on 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:24.430
 the representation of a universe left in 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.039
 food for the players and their fantasies 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.440
 the most whimsical about world of 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:31.960
 warcraft i'm a being from the night who 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.539
 fights with orcs and conquers 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.509
 dungeons with his friends scattered 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:39.880
 in the world and on leaky secondlife 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:41.919
 an avatar a little myself a little different 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:46.180
 thing but that basically is not enough 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:47.830
 fantastic nor realistic enough of a 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.599
 fifth to term 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.940
 others opt for a more solution 

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:53.259
 simple yet the roleplay by forum is 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.639
 there as with the paper role play the 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:56.770
 the only limit is the imagination of 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:58.180
 players it goes without saying that we can not 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.070
 qualify games on games forum 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.360
 video but the question also arises 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.949
 for this canvas effect we can see that 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.570
 one touches there the limits of a kind and 

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:06.010
 that despite the attempts of the creators 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:08.470
 roleplay enthusiasts will only 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:09.849
 never fully satisfied then did he 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.020
 all they have to do is hope that 

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:12.669
 be found in the coming years 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.419
 new technical solutions and 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:15.010
 fun 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:16.900
 and because we can meet the 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:18.400
 as a theatrical dimension of the game a 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.280
 dimension necessarily struggle with the 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.289
 rigidity of the game systems the theater 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.030
 and mess up a notebook and to make 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:29.699
 the praise of the theater you have to start with 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:29.699
 praise the mess louis jouvet
