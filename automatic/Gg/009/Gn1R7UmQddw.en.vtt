00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.530
 hello everyone is welcome to 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.920
 a new video 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:17.190
 so today I was talking to you about the 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.199
 coloring that I made home that 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.140
 unfortunately did not take it as I 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.760
 hoped for it and I'm also talking about 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.740
 the routine that I will put in place 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.810
 which will be slightly delayed to avoid 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.090
 that the hair falls and especially for 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.510
 that they stay as silky as shell 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.730
 barber so why did I do a 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.780
 coloring while my hair does it 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.879
 seven months 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.809
 if they will not put or seven months that I have 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.000
 not the catch and that there is 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.410
 had a fork problem that was 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.989
 a little weakened prey and the 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.700
 facts then already me there is change of 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.079
 time a little bit of news since 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.059
 my hair I have been used to since 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.800
 least two years they are black it's 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.600
 not all that coloring so I 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.730
 leave a little bit of color 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.590
 of big n that I had made and especially 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.650
 here I wanted change and 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.350
 especially under the something that 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.530
 may appear that they can go to 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.780
 my skin tone while not doing 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.689
 flashed as it will fill 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.409
 taken I show it to you I took the 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:22.290
 coloring l'orÃ©al yes see here result 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.759
 the preference the Tuscan m3 for having 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.439
 a light brown here because knowing 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.530
 that I know that my hair is very 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.270
 very dark very dark I wanted some 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.850
 thing that can take so I 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.640
 tried to take the most color 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.650
 clear possible while avoiding that 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.630
 to make a blond or a color not 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.610
 very natural so normally the 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.670
 result they say on the box that 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.899
 had to be that one a little bit 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.600
 darker because my hair 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.340
 are not good and me 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.899
 unfortunately it gave me more 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.090
 glossy effect and sap really took so 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.250
 here we could talk 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.420
 not here I passed behind you can 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.700
 see him there too I do not think 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.929
 where is that a reflection effect are 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.909
 maybe you can see it here 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:09.410
 that's what gave some lashes as 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.480
 if I was going to do something to a sweep 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.000
 while it was not the result that 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.980
 I wanted but good apart it beats the 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.799
 coloring it's done that well and you 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:22.370
 say they give you the manual of 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:25.069
 time I kept 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.980
 this is the little leaflet that shows the 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.329
 way of doing so I took the 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.530
 thurey weeks look colorful since 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:36.470
 more than three months because it's morning 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:37.519
 dated June June 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.560
 2011 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.690
 so it was almost two years so 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.769
 here is this leaflet and for those 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.690
 who in fact can be doing the 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.090
 retouching is this model so it's the 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.879
 present with all the content that I have 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.040
 discarded and they left a care 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:56.629
 sublimator like that to keep well 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.519
 the color obtained and for the facts a 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:00.769
 shine effect so the chlorination that 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.819
 was easy to do we mix for this 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:06.590
 kick a little bit I took a n 1 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.150
 put it in a bowl and I took a 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.650
 passing applicators for sure bienne 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.139
 well apply divided as it is a 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.769
 prices will handle these thirty minutes and 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:16.519
 well I left no 40 minutes to be 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.260
 sure it takes 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.000
 wallis and 30 minutes do not like 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.389
 me may not be the kamikaze you 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.380
 do not advise to make 40 minutes me I 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:27.440
 do them because I felt that the 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.549
 color is not and base despite that 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.639
 it did not take 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:34.400
 so I'm a little disappointed but 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:36.410
 good as long as it does not pass me blond 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.459
 discolored or a rookie not come out 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.349
 possible there is not really a 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.880
 problem a lot the color is beautiful 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:44.820
 it 's good reflection 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.310
 I'm really happy so who 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.650
 take off are said we 've been to slightly 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.450
 the natural color of the hair so 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.150
 when we weaken the hair whatever 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.820
 the treatment of age 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.680
 do what's called a curly 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.290
 to make a color a 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.540
 fading to dozing 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.500
 hair and still weakened so if 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.900
 we weaken it 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.240
 you have to set up a routine 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.980
 concrete capillary to prevent the 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.560
 color it not 10 and especially to avoid 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.970
 that the hair is dry 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.650
 because where a coloring that 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.989
 dries hair even if the room 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.330
 social does not feel because I did 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:25.130
 I went yesterday at icap beauty 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:29.820
 gives a shampoo a brushing that 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:32.420
 is beyond my expectations and that they 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:35.610
 still feed the hair is 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.350
 well the guen '' and it strengthens so 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.480
 for that my parents told me that my 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.190
 routine in samaria as usual if 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.490
 I have time after crazy after boussou 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.780
 steam helmet shampoo protein etc 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.070
 that of a hydrating shampoo rifle 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.840
 either of nature's fear or the total 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.980
 Kids Nathalie origin 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.730
 as you showed in a 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:58.560
 previous video on the street role of my 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.420
 hair shopping and then I'm going 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:04.170
 take the famous mayonnaise air of rs 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:06.500
 good to me stimulates later for good 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.580
 fortified my hair it's a 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.580
 protein pinch and that I consider 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.540
 means for some it's a strong he 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.560
 can become times withdraw or 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:18.210
 to add trouble to cross but I 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.550
 do not want to do it because the week 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.830
 last I did the 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.080
 the to stop is too much too much 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:28.760
 proteins it will bring breakage so 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.930
 for then well balanced the flower the 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.450
 balance by proteins 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.610
 must subsequently put care 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:37.520
 moisturizer you can do it one day 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:40.160
 this several days later or like me the 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.600
 to do next so it takes 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.790
 usually even if it says I 'll 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.440
 take the talent a month ago jean or 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:48.260
 otherwise I'll take you I'll take the 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:52.190
 all-in an email that I will surely 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:54.920
 receive on Friday or at the beginning of camp or 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:57.110
 quotation marks and subsequently to be 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.000
 sure it will help hair well and 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.770
 which remains well hydrate me g take the 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.530
 because is this ballet beautiful screen the living room 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.600
 cream that is absolutely awesome that you 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.680
 can find in the shop bell and 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.720
 bell points as for the one that happens 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.660
 not in Paris or otherwise at the shop 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.190
 Parisian bell and bell and he is 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.260
 income than at bell and bell so if 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.670
 you him in the united states you can you 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.400
 have American contacts you can 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:21.680
 ask them to buy it at just an 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:25.280
 okay you can find also sitting 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:27.740
 old age agree and that's mandate you 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.130
 contact the grifoni bhl in all its 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.890
 shops 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:32.570
 otherwise for us the french dell and 

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:35.150
 ben what like where the store for example 

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:38.210
 eh ben to be sure the hair 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:40.160
 be well hydrated and that the 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:43.730
 balance hydration protein remains 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:46.940
 the same then with that normally mami 

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:48.080
 he should not really have paid attention 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.900
 I'll make you a review report a 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.430
 little bit of a worry and especially the way 

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.090
 here he is going to stay and mean or who 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.590
 remain flexible 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.700
 it's really important before the 

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:58.130
 flexibility because it's good to 

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:59.900
 to strengthen or moisturize the hair but 

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.040
 the most important thing is also the way 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.960
 flexibility also the hair 

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:06.380
 like geo exit the salon because there 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:08.600
 where yesterday is the hairdresser that I salute 

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.850
 princess who took care of me at 

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.740
 Parisian salon and the kpi key that made 

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:14.320
 wonders that cut me off the spikes 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.760
 there you can see it here 

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.260
 no, because that makes me feel light 

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.990
 degraded but honestly I like 

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:23.290
 because that she cut well to her 

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:26.600
 everything is perfectly perfect for a price 

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:28.270
 defying all competition sorry and that 

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.700
 you can see in the info bar 

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:32.920
 where I'm going to recap everything that 

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:35.200
 I did all the care sorry she 

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:36.190
 did for me in the living room by the 

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.250
 delicate areas of the team 

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:42.490
 so here I think it's all said 

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:46.050
 if he does not forget and I tell you to a 

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:46.050
 next video lease
