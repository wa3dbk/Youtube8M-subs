00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
but this is you need to use the wrong

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.220 
but this is you need to use the wrong
one<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.670> uncooked<00:00:30.060> because<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.869> don't<00:00:31.050> use

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
one the uncooked because you don't use

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
actually the ratio is probably a little

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.030 
actually the ratio is probably a little
bit<00:01:05.580> more<00:01:05.670> but<00:01:06.320> since<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:07.590> isn't<00:01:07.860> a

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
bit more but since this isn't a

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.770

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
cheese on the ends now I'm sure that I

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.080 
cheese on the ends now I'm sure that I
know<00:01:38.220> there's<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.700> special<00:01:39.150> LIVE<00:01:40.970> folding<00:01:41.970> this

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090

pastry class that day but there's a
certain<00:01:52.439> way<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.680> twisting<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:53.460> thing<00:01:53.700> over

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
certain way of twisting this thing over

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.410 
certain way of twisting this thing over
to<00:01:54.500> make<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.649> look<00:01:55.770> really<00:01:56.100> nice

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
to make it look really nice

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.970 
to make it look really nice
we're<00:01:57.870> trying<00:01:58.080> to<00:01:58.140> squeeze<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.410> little<00:01:58.590> bit<00:01:58.830> of

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:58.980 
we're trying to squeeze a little bit of

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.050 
we're trying to squeeze a little bit of
air<00:01:59.190> out<00:01:59.220> of<00:01:59.460> here<00:02:00.440> but<00:02:01.440> the<00:02:02.400> main<00:02:02.640> thing<00:02:02.880> is

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:05.099 
squeeze it I would fill that thing with

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:09.950 
squeeze it I would fill that thing with
hot<00:05:05.280> sauce<00:05:05.520> and<00:05:06.320> then<00:05:07.320> I<00:05:07.500> would<00:05:08.660> squeeze<00:05:09.660> sauce

that<00:05:13.470> should<00:05:13.620> continue<00:05:13.830> squeezing<00:05:14.610> so<00:05:17.000> there

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
that should continue squeezing so there

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.360 
that should continue squeezing so there
you<00:05:18.090> have<00:05:18.270> it

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370
