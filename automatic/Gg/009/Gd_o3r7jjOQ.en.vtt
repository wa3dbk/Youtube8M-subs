00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 very good to all the kids 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.370
 Welcome to my channel and today I bring you 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.319
 a new video of gta 5 and I'm going to 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.469
 teach how to get a vehicle on 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.960
 vehicle that I'm going to teach is this 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.120
 here to see if he recognizes it 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.770
 I guess if we have one who has 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.410
 played the campaign you know what 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.189
 vehicle I'm talking about this vehicle is 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.510
 the truck of trevor and as you see 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.980
 I suppose you have four seats 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.380
 comes to check completely because no 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.670
 I have enough people who judge this 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.170
 as to check it but it has four 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.559
 squares and it's pretty good to throw 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.540
 some laughs where is that this truck 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.579
 it is in a little way 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.739
 miss the truth because it is a 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.180
 secret location I do not know is not by 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.430
 The mode 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.860
 by online mode if beyond the map 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.360
 you go and you find it you have to do 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.190
 a series of steps that I am going to show you 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.260
 I in this video and I love you too 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.280
 show that this truck apart from 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.410
 get it 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.379
 as I'll show you can get in 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.850
 the saints together to modify the 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.770
 whole you can put what you want not 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.420
 there you see is how you can do exactly 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.640
 just like in campaign mode you can 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.290
 to do what you want with it 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.600
 response can repair the brakes 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.850
 change what the bumper can be 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.060
 put you with the different you can 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.720
 put an engine you can put another type 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:22.560
 of color for example the color I do not know 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.080
 let's put white we are not Reds 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.850
 you can do whatever you want with it 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.649
 truth is that this truck is fine 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.750
 to laugh because man 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:33.310
 pretty what is beautiful is not me 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.530
 it seems a bit pretty 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.360
 a little scary but man if you 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.210
 You put a different color for the same 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.369
 it seems something better, well, I'm going to 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.650
 proceed now to teach you how to 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.480
 does and now we go back 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.040
 well the first step and a step that I 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.590
 it seems quite fundamental is that 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.480
 you have to take the map and see where 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.010
 is your house in my case my house 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.180
 is here to the garage pretty much it's by 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.220
 here you are going to put him with the 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.840
 triangle a point of interest is worth this 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.190
 is going to serve for a step that we are going to make 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.960
 later because we will not be able to see 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.360
 the house the next step that I'm going to 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.300
 show is with the start mode you have to 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.729
 give online activities you have to 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.500
 give him to host an activity 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.380
 those created by rockstar search 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.900
 missions and give to the activity of 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.250
 dirt road 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.620
 if you have it to English I think it's called 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.240
 dirty rotten you look at the 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.080
 characteristics that the game has 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.550
 the right and it will come out is very important 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.680
 important thing about being a host 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.500
 activity do not try to do both 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.930
 friends together because it's harder 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.640
 because you have to finish the 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.730
 activity to be able to care with the 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.990
 vehicle so here you can put what 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.670
 you want me just here is the 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.770
 radio you can put difficulty the one 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.330
 come out of the turnip that is basically 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.860
 because you are not going to finish the activity or 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.210
 it is therefore to do what you want or 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.300
 give 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.500
 at the start of the game and now we come back 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.790
 once the game starts, the only thing 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.400
 we have to do is very simple is 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.680
 hit the X button or the button on the 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.620
 chs and I'm not wrong is the button that 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.510
 you have everything down to run in the 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.710
 xbox you have to run run running 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.050
 run and give me in this 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.370
 I walk if we start here because you start 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.840
 to run towards this road and here the 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.550
 you see here it's parked and it's of it 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.550
 it's not the only way to get it 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.780
 this truck now comes what 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.120
 important that has been said in the first 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.760
 step not if you remember that I told you that 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.700
 put a point of interest on the map 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.290
 that's why I'm going to teach you now 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.320
 what you have to do is save our 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.050
 truck in the garage but as you see 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.250
 we get the symbol of our house with 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.680
 which the point of interest that we have 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.720
 marked will be to know when where 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.510
 our house is not good now we are going to 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.800
 proceed to take it and now we come back 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.260
 good kids we are already reaching my 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:47.020
 good house as it was said the only thing 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.090
 What remains is to keep the car in 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.440
 the garage and it's a step that is very 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.850
 simple you basically enter the 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.710
 garage with him and you're 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.610
 I have enough room to put this 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.620
 car so 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.330
 how are you going to see now appear in the 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.210
 garage next to the other cars and here 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.020
 It is among them 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:07.030
 and nothing more then if you want to take it to 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.440
 the saints customs to modify some 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.060
 whatever it takes to take it 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.140
 also so good kids this has 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.250
 been everything I hope you liked the 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.920
 video tell me the comments that you 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.830
 it seems and I'll bring you more content 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.340
 gta 5 is good until the next 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:20.340
 goodbye
