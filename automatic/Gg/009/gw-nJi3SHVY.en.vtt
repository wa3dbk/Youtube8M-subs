warthog based off the Halo 4 version of
course<00:01:04.299> and<00:01:04.770> this<00:01:05.770> is<00:01:05.830> the<00:01:06.040> first<00:01:06.549> vehicle

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
course and this is the first vehicle

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.480 
course and this is the first vehicle
that<00:01:07.570> I<00:01:07.600> have<00:01:07.900> designed<00:01:08.620> completely<00:01:09.040> by

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
that I have designed completely by

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.289 
that I have designed completely by
myself<00:01:09.520> I<00:01:10.150> didn't<00:01:10.390> use<00:01:10.510> any<00:01:10.750> other<00:01:10.930> Lego<00:01:12.299> MOC

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
myself I didn't use any other Lego MOC

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:15.899 
myself I didn't use any other Lego MOC
makers<00:01:13.780> designs<00:01:14.470> for<00:01:15.010> reference<00:01:15.460> the<00:01:15.610> only

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
makers designs for reference the only

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.660 
makers designs for reference the only
thing<00:01:16.090> I<00:01:16.210> used<00:01:16.479> was<00:01:17.170> the<00:01:17.590> reference<00:01:18.280> picture

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
thing I used was the reference picture

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.550 
thing I used was the reference picture
from<00:01:18.820> the<00:01:18.970> actual<00:01:19.299> game<00:01:19.630> so<00:01:20.409> this<00:01:20.500> is

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
from the actual game so this is

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.960 
from the actual game so this is
completely<00:01:21.280> 100%<00:01:21.909> my<00:01:22.360> design<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:24.340> let's<00:01:24.820> get

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
completely 100% my design so let's get

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.620 
completely 100% my design so let's get
started<00:01:25.450> um<00:01:25.570> I<00:01:26.430> did<00:01:27.430> want<00:01:27.670> to<00:01:27.729> base<00:01:27.909> it<00:01:28.180> more<00:01:28.510> on

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
started um I did want to base it more on

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.200 
started um I did want to base it more on
accuracy<00:01:29.140> than<00:01:29.530> playability<00:01:30.040> so<00:01:30.460> it<00:01:30.549> is<00:01:30.760> a<00:01:30.790> bit

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
accuracy than playability so it is a bit

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.730 
accuracy than playability so it is a bit
fragile<00:01:31.540> but<00:01:31.960> you<00:01:32.049> know<00:01:32.170> it<00:01:32.320> holds<00:01:32.619> together

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
fragile but you know it holds together

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.190 
fragile but you know it holds together
pretty<00:01:33.100> well<00:01:33.270> mainly<00:01:34.270> because<00:01:34.450> I'm<00:01:34.870> not<00:01:34.990> going

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
pretty well mainly because I'm not going

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.050 
pretty well mainly because I'm not going
to<00:01:35.260> be<00:01:35.350> using<00:01:35.650> in<00:01:35.800> any<00:01:35.980> like<00:01:36.220> stop<00:01:36.490> motions<00:01:36.910> or

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
to be using in any like stop motions or

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.350 
to be using in any like stop motions or
anything<00:01:37.240> it's<00:01:37.570> just<00:01:37.630> for<00:01:37.990> the<00:01:38.560> use<00:01:38.740> in<00:01:38.950> machs

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
anything it's just for the use in machs

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.390 
anything it's just for the use in machs
so<00:01:40.360> it's<00:01:41.200> got<00:01:41.350> a<00:01:41.380> pretty<00:01:41.680> good<00:01:41.920> suspension

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
so it's got a pretty good suspension

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.600 
so it's got a pretty good suspension
system<00:01:43.000> it's<00:01:43.180> ok<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.890> know<00:01:45.010> it<00:01:45.430> holds

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
system it's ok you know it holds

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.960 
system it's ok you know it holds
together<00:01:45.880> it's<00:01:46.300> pretty<00:01:46.420> good<00:01:47.040> turning<00:01:48.040> wheels

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.100 

from<00:01:53.700> pretty<00:01:54.700> fun<00:01:54.970> to<00:01:55.150> play<00:01:55.180> with<00:01:55.600> if<00:01:55.780> you<00:01:55.900> ask

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
from pretty fun to play with if you ask

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.380 
from pretty fun to play with if you ask
me<00:01:56.410> but<00:01:56.980> anyway<00:01:57.520> let's<00:01:57.700> get<00:01:57.790> into<00:01:58.060> some<00:01:58.240> of<00:01:58.270> the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
me but anyway let's get into some of the

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.070 
me but anyway let's get into some of the
details<00:01:58.980> the<00:01:59.980> front<00:02:00.340> was<00:02:00.580> a<00:02:00.940> pretty<00:02:01.510> hard<00:02:01.780> part

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
details the front was a pretty hard part

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.810 
details the front was a pretty hard part
to<00:02:02.200> figure<00:02:02.500> out<00:02:02.710> how<00:02:02.950> to<00:02:03.010> make<00:02:03.220> it<00:02:03.250> get<00:02:03.610> that

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
to figure out how to make it get that

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.120 
to figure out how to make it get that
curved<00:02:04.240> thing<00:02:04.600> area<00:02:05.080> right<00:02:05.290> there<00:02:05.530> by<00:02:05.890> the<00:02:05.950> way

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
curved thing area right there by the way

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.560 
curved thing area right there by the way
this<00:02:06.280> was<00:02:06.580> designed<00:02:06.790> in<00:02:07.120> lego<00:02:07.330> Digital

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
this was designed in lego Digital

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.009 
this was designed in lego Digital
Designer<00:02:08.099> like<00:02:09.099> a<00:02:09.129> lot<00:02:09.369> of<00:02:09.489> my<00:02:09.610> things<00:02:09.879> are<00:02:10.060> so

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
Designer like a lot of my things are so

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:12.869 
Designer like a lot of my things are so
it<00:02:11.500> was<00:02:11.709> hard<00:02:11.950> to<00:02:12.010> get<00:02:12.159> that<00:02:12.370> curve<00:02:12.640> but<00:02:12.849> I

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879 
it was hard to get that curve but I

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:14.220 
it was hard to get that curve but I
finally<00:02:13.269> got<00:02:13.420> it

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
finally got it

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.440 
finally got it
the<00:02:14.800> only<00:02:14.980> downside<00:02:15.489> is<00:02:15.519> I<00:02:15.790> couldn't<00:02:16.060> have<00:02:16.209> one

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
the only downside is I couldn't have one

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.990 
the only downside is I couldn't have one
of<00:02:16.569> those<00:02:16.950> there's<00:02:17.950> like<00:02:18.099> a<00:02:18.129> great<00:02:18.550> thing<00:02:18.819> that

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
of those there's like a great thing that

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.479 
of those there's like a great thing that
goes<00:02:19.180> right<00:02:19.420> there<00:02:19.690> but<00:02:20.170> that's<00:02:20.319> fine<00:02:20.530> it

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
goes right there but that's fine it

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.229 
goes right there but that's fine it
looks<00:02:21.700> good<00:02:21.849> enough<00:02:21.909> so<00:02:22.800> that's<00:02:23.800> that<00:02:24.150> for<00:02:25.150> the

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
looks good enough so that's that for the

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.690 
looks good enough so that's that for the
pipes<00:02:25.510> right<00:02:25.780> there<00:02:26.110> it<00:02:26.890> was<00:02:27.040> actually<00:02:27.430> kind

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
pipes right there it was actually kind

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.660 
pipes right there it was actually kind
of<00:02:27.819> hard<00:02:28.060> if<00:02:28.569> you<00:02:28.720> can<00:02:28.930> see<00:02:29.260> that<00:02:30.040> one<00:02:30.310> looks<00:02:30.549> a

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
of hard if you can see that one looks a

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.250 
of hard if you can see that one looks a
lot<00:02:30.879> better<00:02:31.090> and<00:02:31.420> that<00:02:31.540> one's<00:02:31.720> a<00:02:31.840> bit<00:02:31.989> dented

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
lot better and that one's a bit dented

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.559 
lot better and that one's a bit dented
and<00:02:32.590> stuff<00:02:32.830> cuz<00:02:33.040> that<00:02:33.250> one<00:02:33.430> I<00:02:33.580> got<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.150> curving

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
and stuff cuz that one I got the curving

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.809 
and stuff cuz that one I got the curving
of<00:02:34.690> it<00:02:34.810> right<00:02:35.019> on<00:02:35.170> my<00:02:35.200> first<00:02:35.620> try<00:02:35.980> and<00:02:36.580> it<00:02:36.700> was

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
of it right on my first try and it was

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.570 
of it right on my first try and it was
pretty<00:02:37.030> easy<00:02:37.270> but<00:02:37.600> then<00:02:37.750> that<00:02:37.959> one<00:02:38.280> took<00:02:39.280> a<00:02:39.340> bit

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
pretty easy but then that one took a bit

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.280 
pretty easy but then that one took a bit
more<00:02:39.880> of

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
more of

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.740 
more of
to<00:02:40.799> do<00:02:40.920> that<00:02:41.069> so<00:02:41.310> that<00:02:41.430> was<00:02:41.549> kind<00:02:41.760> of<00:02:41.819> tough<00:02:42.030> but

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
to do that so that was kind of tough but

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.110 
to do that so that was kind of tough but
uh<00:02:42.810> also<00:02:43.409> if<00:02:43.980> you<00:02:44.129> can<00:02:44.280> see<00:02:44.459> it<00:02:44.579> fits<00:02:44.730> a<00:02:44.879> brick

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
uh also if you can see it fits a brick

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.599 
uh also if you can see it fits a brick
warrior<00:02:45.510> Spartan<00:02:45.959> warrior<00:02:46.319> so<00:02:47.219> that's<00:02:47.370> pretty

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:47.609 
warrior Spartan warrior so that's pretty

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:50.030 
warrior Spartan warrior so that's pretty
cool<00:02:47.900> you<00:02:48.900> can<00:02:48.930> fit<00:02:49.260> one<00:02:49.379> on<00:02:49.439> that<00:02:49.650> side<00:02:49.709> as

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
cool you can fit one on that side as

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.880 
cool you can fit one on that side as
well

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
well

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.890 
well
you<00:02:52.890> can<00:02:53.010> also<00:02:53.159> fit<00:02:53.459> a<00:02:53.489> brick<00:02:53.700> for<00:02:53.879> Forge<00:02:54.629> one

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
you can also fit a brick for Forge one

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.929 
you can also fit a brick for Forge one
of<00:02:55.019> course<00:02:55.290> if<00:02:55.469> you'd<00:02:55.620> like<00:02:55.829> to<00:02:56.069> but<00:02:56.730> this<00:02:56.879> is

00:02:56.929 --> 00:02:56.939 
of course if you'd like to but this is

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:02.420 
of course if you'd like to but this is
Halo<00:02:57.299> 4<00:02:57.689> so<00:02:57.959> I<00:02:57.989> don't<00:02:58.230> know<00:02:58.379> why<00:03:00.019> turret<00:03:01.019> is<00:03:01.430> 360

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
Halo 4 so I don't know why turret is 360

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.640 
Halo 4 so I don't know why turret is 360
degrees<00:03:02.760> rotatable<00:03:03.299> if<00:03:03.599> you<00:03:04.079> don't<00:03:04.379> have<00:03:04.620> a

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
degrees rotatable if you don't have a

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.069 
degrees rotatable if you don't have a
figure<00:03:05.120> cuz<00:03:06.120> he'll<00:03:06.299> get<00:03:06.420> stuck<00:03:06.659> like<00:03:06.840> right

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
figure cuz he'll get stuck like right

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:08.869 
figure cuz he'll get stuck like right
there<00:03:07.260> but<00:03:07.769> if<00:03:07.829> you<00:03:07.980> don't<00:03:08.189> it<00:03:08.400> can<00:03:08.489> go<00:03:08.670> all<00:03:08.790> the

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
there but if you don't it can go all the

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:12.410 
there but if you don't it can go all the
way<00:03:08.909> around<00:03:10.459> for<00:03:11.459> the<00:03:11.549> turret<00:03:11.909> you<00:03:12.090> can<00:03:12.239> see<00:03:12.389> I

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
way around for the turret you can see I

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.869 
way around for the turret you can see I
use<00:03:12.659> the<00:03:12.840> brick<00:03:13.079> arms<00:03:13.439> ammo<00:03:13.950> chain<00:03:14.280> from<00:03:14.760> the

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 
use the brick arms ammo chain from the

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:16.490 
use the brick arms ammo chain from the
minigun<00:03:15.269> I<00:03:15.329> think<00:03:15.720> that<00:03:15.870> worked<00:03:16.079> pretty<00:03:16.200> well

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
minigun I think that worked pretty well

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.500 
minigun I think that worked pretty well
a<00:03:16.739> lot<00:03:17.129> of<00:03:17.159> people<00:03:17.280> have<00:03:17.670> done<00:03:17.939> that<00:03:18.120> it's<00:03:18.419> a

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
a lot of people have done that it's a

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.390 
a lot of people have done that it's a
pretty<00:03:18.840> common<00:03:19.139> idea<00:03:19.530> but<00:03:21.859> for<00:03:22.859> the<00:03:22.950> back<00:03:23.129> I

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
pretty common idea but for the back I

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.509 
pretty common idea but for the back I
have<00:03:23.939> these<00:03:24.120> gas<00:03:24.359> tanks<00:03:24.930> pretty<00:03:25.739> simple<00:03:26.159> kind

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
have these gas tanks pretty simple kind

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.759 
have these gas tanks pretty simple kind
of<00:03:26.549> looks<00:03:26.730> like<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:27.000> one<00:03:27.120> from<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.510> game<00:03:27.769> more

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
of looks like the one from the game more

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.119 
of looks like the one from the game more
piping<00:03:29.220> back<00:03:29.430> there<00:03:30.230> like<00:03:31.230> I<00:03:31.409> said<00:03:31.439> it<00:03:31.980> is<00:03:32.010> a

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 
piping back there like I said it is a

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:35.960 
piping back there like I said it is a
bit<00:03:32.370> fragile<00:03:33.980> for<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.099> seats<00:03:35.370> I<00:03:35.519> think<00:03:35.730> I<00:03:35.790> got

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
bit fragile for the seats I think I got

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.629 
bit fragile for the seats I think I got
a<00:03:36.000> lot<00:03:36.299> of<00:03:36.450> interior<00:03:36.930> design<00:03:37.500> good<00:03:38.250> on<00:03:38.400> this

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
a lot of interior design good on this

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:42.619 
a lot of interior design good on this
thing<00:03:40.549> most<00:03:41.549> people<00:03:41.849> don't<00:03:41.970> really<00:03:42.150> go<00:03:42.450> for

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:42.629 
thing most people don't really go for

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:45.379 
thing most people don't really go for
interior<00:03:42.900> but<00:03:43.230> I<00:03:43.260> think<00:03:43.620> I<00:03:44.030> mind<00:03:45.030> turned<00:03:45.239> out

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
interior but I think I mind turned out

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:48.439 
interior but I think I mind turned out
pretty<00:03:45.599> well<00:03:45.690> so<00:03:45.919> that's<00:03:46.919> where<00:03:47.129> the<00:03:47.449> figure

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:48.449 
pretty well so that's where the figure

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:51.409 
pretty well so that's where the figure
would<00:03:48.599> sit<00:03:48.959> if<00:03:49.229> he<00:03:49.500> there<00:03:49.829> was<00:03:49.979> one<00:03:50.239> it's<00:03:51.239> got

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:51.419 
would sit if he there was one it's got

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:53.240 
would sit if he there was one it's got
this<00:03:51.629> little<00:03:51.870> piece<00:03:52.470> back<00:03:52.680> there<00:03:52.889> it's<00:03:53.040> kind

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
this little piece back there it's kind

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.309 
this little piece back there it's kind
of<00:03:53.340> like<00:03:53.459> the<00:03:53.609> flag<00:03:53.909> piece<00:03:54.239> you<00:03:54.449> use<00:03:54.720> connected

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
of like the flag piece you use connected

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.339 
of like the flag piece you use connected
to<00:03:55.409> the<00:03:55.500> little<00:03:55.709> clip<00:03:55.949> and<00:03:56.810> of<00:03:57.810> course<00:03:58.049> you<00:03:58.199> can

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
to the little clip and of course you can

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.039 
to the little clip and of course you can
see<00:03:58.530> the<00:03:58.560> binoculars<00:03:59.220> and<00:03:59.250> that<00:03:59.549> red<00:04:00.049> circular

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
see the binoculars and that red circular

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.439 
see the binoculars and that red circular
round<00:04:01.620> plate<00:04:02.040> thing<00:04:02.370> on<00:04:02.519> there<00:04:02.760> for<00:04:03.329> some

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:03.449 
round plate thing on there for some

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:05.809 
round plate thing on there for some
extra<00:04:03.750> details<00:04:04.139> could<00:04:04.409> be<00:04:04.500> like<00:04:04.680> a<00:04:04.709> radio<00:04:05.159> or<00:04:05.220> a

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
extra details could be like a radio or a

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.240 
extra details could be like a radio or a
warning<00:04:06.599> light<00:04:06.810> if<00:04:07.109> the<00:04:07.440> war<00:04:07.799> hogs<00:04:08.010> are<00:04:08.159> not

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
warning light if the war hogs are not

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.289 
warning light if the war hogs are not
working<00:04:08.430> and<00:04:09.090> then<00:04:09.239> on<00:04:09.389> the<00:04:09.540> driver's<00:04:10.199> side

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
working and then on the driver's side

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.520 
working and then on the driver's side
couldn't<00:04:12.299> fit<00:04:12.449> a<00:04:12.479> wheel<00:04:12.750> but<00:04:12.989> I<00:04:13.019> did<00:04:13.290> have<00:04:13.500> a

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
couldn't fit a wheel but I did have a

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.170 
couldn't fit a wheel but I did have a
control<00:04:14.010> panel<00:04:14.400> right<00:04:14.430> there<00:04:14.760> with<00:04:14.909> another

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
control panel right there with another

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.539 
control panel right there with another
red<00:04:15.479> light<00:04:15.859> so<00:04:16.859> I<00:04:16.889> think<00:04:17.130> that<00:04:17.280> looks<00:04:17.489> pretty

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
red light so I think that looks pretty

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.790 
red light so I think that looks pretty
cool<00:04:17.849> and<00:04:18.690> yeah<00:04:19.620> that's<00:04:20.039> pretty<00:04:20.220> much<00:04:20.340> it

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:21.800 
cool and yeah that's pretty much it

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.260 
cool and yeah that's pretty much it
it's<00:04:22.800> a<00:04:22.860> pretty<00:04:23.070> good<00:04:23.280> diet<00:04:23.490> designed<00:04:24.030> for<00:04:24.180> the

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
it's a pretty good diet designed for the

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.870 
it's a pretty good diet designed for the
war<00:04:24.449> hog<00:04:24.690> I<00:04:24.930> like<00:04:25.199> it<00:04:25.349> a<00:04:25.440> lot<00:04:25.650> if<00:04:26.250> you<00:04:26.610> want<00:04:26.789> to
