00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
come down then cool and come down you

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:38.750 
come down then cool and come down you
don't<00:00:37.710> want<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.890> be<00:00:37.950> stuck<00:00:38.160> in<00:00:38.219> them<00:00:38.579> because

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
don't want to be stuck in them because

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.760 
don't want to be stuck in them because
if<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:38.940> get<00:00:39.000> stuck<00:00:39.270> in<00:00:39.300> them<00:00:39.660> raining<00:00:40.649> they're

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
if you get stuck in them raining they're

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.139 
if you get stuck in them raining they're
coming<00:00:41.129> down<00:00:41.309> there'll<00:00:41.460> be<00:00:41.489> no<00:00:41.700> win<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.090> you

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
coming down there'll be no win and you

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.670 
coming down there'll be no win and you
could<00:00:42.329> be<00:00:42.450> left<00:00:42.690> sitting<00:00:43.050> there<00:00:43.260> for<00:00:43.410> quite<00:00:43.620> a

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
could be left sitting there for quite a

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.740 
could be left sitting there for quite a
long<00:00:43.860> time<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.730> no<00:00:45.270> bueno

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
long time so that is no bueno

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.450 
long time so that is no bueno
bro<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.440> what<00:00:46.590> we're<00:00:46.710> trying<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.950> do<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.250> get

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
bro and what we're trying to do is get

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.580 
bro and what we're trying to do is get
around<00:00:47.610> those<00:00:47.910> little<00:00:48.090> clouds<00:00:48.420> or<00:00:49.200> feet<00:00:49.410> by

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
around those little clouds or feet by

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.790 
around those little clouds or feet by
then<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.420> make<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.539> advantage<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.260> in

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
then and make it advantage so you in

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.100 
then and make it advantage so you in
these<00:00:53.070> places<00:00:53.789> like<00:00:54.030> near<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.570> Dalton<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.050> you

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
these places like near the Dalton so you

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.660 
these places like near the Dalton so you
get<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.379> lot<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.680> squalls<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.219> lot<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.430> tricky

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
get a lot of squalls a lot of tricky

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.189 
get a lot of squalls a lot of tricky
conditions<00:00:56.879> it's<00:00:57.600> going<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.780> make<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.989> best

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
conditions it's going to make the best

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.410 
conditions it's going to make the best
of<00:00:58.320> what<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.559> got<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.039> sir<00:00:59.309> that's<00:01:00.300> the
