what's going on guys I'm gonna show you
how<00:00:02.429> to<00:00:02.460> tie<00:00:02.669> a<00:00:02.700> knot<00:00:02.730> today<00:00:03.120> I<00:00:03.720> came<00:00:04.049> across

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
how to tie a knot today I came across

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.309 
how to tie a knot today I came across
this<00:00:04.440> on<00:00:04.589> YouTube<00:00:05.000> and<00:00:06.000> this<00:00:06.750> is<00:00:06.930> supposed<00:00:07.200> to

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
this on YouTube and this is supposed to

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.070 
this on YouTube and this is supposed to
be<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:07.589> best<00:00:07.770> not<00:00:08.010> for<00:00:08.460> fluorocarbon<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:09.150> lot

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
be the best not for fluorocarbon a lot

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.390 
be the best not for fluorocarbon a lot
of<00:00:10.170> guys<00:00:10.290> are<00:00:10.440> saying<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:10.740> Palomar<00:00:11.010> knot<00:00:11.070> is

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
of guys are saying the Palomar knot is

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.970 
of guys are saying the Palomar knot is
bad<00:00:11.639> because<00:00:12.599> as<00:00:12.780> it<00:00:12.929> gets<00:00:13.080> tighter<00:00:13.380> it<00:00:13.740> cuts

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
bad because as it gets tighter it cuts

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.640 
bad because as it gets tighter it cuts
itself<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.780> which<00:00:15.780> causes<00:00:16.109> you<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.260> force<00:00:16.470> to

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
itself and which causes you to force to

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.609 
itself and which causes you to force to
break<00:00:16.770> off<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.190> lose<00:00:17.279> fish

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:18.619 
break off and lose fish

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.810 
break off and lose fish
I've<00:00:19.619> been<00:00:19.830> used<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.100> Palomar<00:00:20.430> knot<00:00:20.490> a

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
I've been used a Palomar knot a

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.340 
I've been used a Palomar knot a
fluorocarbon<00:00:21.180> for<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.630> few<00:00:21.750> years<00:00:21.930> now<00:00:21.990> and

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
fluorocarbon for a few years now and

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.980 
fluorocarbon for a few years now and
I've<00:00:23.250> never<00:00:23.369> had<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:23.609> happen<00:00:23.760> but<00:00:24.600> I<00:00:24.660> retain

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
I've never had that happen but I retain

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.660 
I've never had that happen but I retain
after<00:00:25.199> every<00:00:25.350> fish<00:00:25.560> so<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:26.369> think<00:00:26.460> if<00:00:26.580> you

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
after every fish so I think if you

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.429 
after every fish so I think if you
retire<00:00:26.970> often<00:00:27.269> enough<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.869> Palomar<00:00:28.199> knots

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
retire often enough the Palomar knots

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.620 
retire often enough the Palomar knots
just<00:00:28.500> fine<00:00:28.830> but<00:00:29.670> if<00:00:29.789> not<00:00:29.939> you<00:00:30.300> may<00:00:30.420> want<00:00:30.449> to

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
just fine but if not you may want to

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.139 
just fine but if not you may want to
give<00:00:30.720> this<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.869> shot<00:00:31.250> sha<00:00:32.250> Grisby<00:00:32.669> was<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.030> one

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
give this a shot sha Grisby was the one

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.780 
give this a shot sha Grisby was the one
I<00:00:33.180> seen<00:00:33.480> tie<00:00:33.630> this<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.140> he<00:00:34.980> said<00:00:35.219> it's<00:00:35.670> the

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
I seen tie this and he said it's the

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.610 
I seen tie this and he said it's the
best<00:00:35.910> not<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.660> tie<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:37.350> know<00:00:37.440> for

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
best not to tie you know for

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.680 
best not to tie you know for
fluorocarbon<00:00:37.950> line<00:00:38.219> so<00:00:39.090> it's<00:00:39.239> pretty<00:00:39.360> easy<00:00:39.570> to

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
fluorocarbon line so it's pretty easy to

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.889 
fluorocarbon line so it's pretty easy to
do<00:00:39.899> it's<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.260> little<00:00:40.469> difficult<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.860> hold<00:00:41.899> but

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
do it's a little difficult to hold but

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.190 
do it's a little difficult to hold but
you<00:00:42.989> start<00:00:43.230> off<00:00:43.350> just<00:00:43.530> like<00:00:43.649> you<00:00:43.829> would<00:00:45.200> the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
you start off just like you would the

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.600 
you start off just like you would the
Palomar<00:00:46.950> knot<00:00:47.180> you<00:00:48.180> run<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.390> double<00:00:48.600> line

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
Palomar knot you run a double line

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:58.670 
Palomar knot you run a double line
through<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.730> eye

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.250 

I<00:00:58.770> like<00:00:59.490> to<00:00:59.640> hold<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.850> loop<00:01:00.030> side<00:01:00.360> in<00:01:00.900> my<00:01:01.050> right

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
I like to hold the loop side in my right

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.000 
I like to hold the loop side in my right
hand<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.710> do<00:01:02.700> whatever<00:01:02.940> works<00:01:03.180> best<00:01:03.330> for<00:01:03.420> you

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
hand I do whatever works best for you

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.520 
hand I do whatever works best for you
get<00:01:05.010> yourself<00:01:05.280> plenty<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.580> line<00:01:06.290> so<00:01:07.290> get<00:01:07.410> your

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
get yourself plenty of line so get your

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.150 
get yourself plenty of line so get your
loop<00:01:07.710> then<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.400> got<00:01:08.580> your<00:01:08.730> mainline<00:01:08.940> tag<00:01:09.540> end

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
loop then you got your mainline tag end

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.440 
loop then you got your mainline tag end
take<00:01:11.160> that<00:01:11.340> loop<00:01:11.550> and<00:01:11.760> wrapped<00:01:12.150> around<00:01:12.270> your

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
take that loop and wrapped around your

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.910 
take that loop and wrapped around your
index<00:01:12.510> finger<00:01:13.400> so<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.430> made<00:01:14.580> another<00:01:14.790> loop

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
index finger so you made another loop

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.219 
index finger so you made another loop
grab<00:01:16.920> your<00:01:17.160> bait<00:01:17.780> you<00:01:18.780> want<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:18.990> take<00:01:19.080> this

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
grab your bait you want to take this

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.140 
grab your bait you want to take this
loop<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.920> wrap<00:01:20.040> around<00:01:20.100> these<00:01:20.430> these<00:01:20.850> lines

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
loop and wrap around these these lines

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:30.969 
loop and wrap around these these lines
three<00:01:21.930> times<00:01:23.240> one<00:01:24.240> two<00:01:26.869> three<00:01:28.640> then<00:01:29.640> take<00:01:29.910> this

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
three times one two three then take this

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.240 
three times one two three then take this
loop<00:01:31.979> here<00:01:33.500> and<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.590> want<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.740> stick<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.040> in

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
loop here and you want to stick it in

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.660 
loop here and you want to stick it in
the<00:01:35.369> first<00:01:35.580> loop<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.090> made<00:01:37.430> if<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.580> guys

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
the first loop that you made if you guys

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.930 
the first loop that you made if you guys
can<00:01:38.850> see<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.119> or<00:01:39.210> not<00:01:40.130> but<00:01:41.130> run<00:01:41.670> for<00:01:41.880> the

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
can see that or not but run for the

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.770 
can see that or not but run for the
first<00:01:42.090> loop<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.660> made<00:01:44.390> and<00:01:45.390> grab<00:01:45.600> that

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
first loop that you made and grab that

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.950 
first loop that you made and grab that
loop<00:01:48.259> start<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.350> cinch<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.649> down<00:01:50.840> wet<00:01:51.840> your

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
loop start to cinch it down wet your

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.730 
loop start to cinch it down wet your
line<00:01:52.369> you<00:01:53.369> want<00:01:53.550> to<00:01:53.610> grab<00:01:53.790> your<00:01:54.320> single<00:01:55.320> tag<00:01:55.530> in

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
line you want to grab your single tag in

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.499 
line you want to grab your single tag in
and<00:01:55.920> your<00:01:56.040> main<00:01:56.190> line<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.820> start<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.210> cinch<00:01:57.390> it

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
and your main line and start to cinch it

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.740 
and your main line and start to cinch it
down<00:02:01.399> you<00:02:02.399> can<00:02:02.520> see<00:02:02.700> those<00:02:02.880> wraps<00:02:03.180> stacking<00:02:03.659> up

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
down you can see those wraps stacking up

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.910 
down you can see those wraps stacking up
on<00:02:03.840> each<00:02:03.960> other<00:02:05.960> they're<00:02:06.960> all<00:02:07.080> nice<00:02:07.320> stack

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
on each other they're all nice stack

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.139 
on each other they're all nice stack
neat<00:02:08.220> when<00:02:08.519> it's<00:02:08.640> all<00:02:08.700> done

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
neat when it's all done

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.060 
neat when it's all done
they're<00:02:09.690> not<00:02:09.869> real<00:02:10.080> neat<00:02:10.290> you<00:02:10.560> can<00:02:10.590> grab<00:02:10.890> that

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
they're not real neat you can grab that

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.500 
they're not real neat you can grab that
loop<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.580> kind<00:02:11.670> of<00:02:11.790> back<00:02:11.910> them<00:02:12.060> off<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.239> little

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
loop and kind of back them off a little

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.710 
loop and kind of back them off a little
