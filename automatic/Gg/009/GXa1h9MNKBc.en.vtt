00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
know but I've done a lot of videos on

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.870 
know but I've done a lot of videos on
cluster<00:00:16.980> computers<00:00:17.369> especially<00:00:17.520> by

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.070 
videos on Raspberry Pi cluster computers
I<00:00:23.400> wanted<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.699> go<00:00:23.820> bigger<00:00:24.600> than<00:00:24.810> I've<00:00:24.930> ever

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
I wanted to go bigger than I've ever

gone before now if you guys don't know I
created<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.320> series<00:00:28.650> on<00:00:28.890> how<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.220> create

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
created a series on how to create

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.580 
created a series on how to create
cluster<00:00:30.029> computers<00:00:30.599> using<00:00:30.810> Raspberry<00:00:31.349> Pi<00:00:31.380> so

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
cluster computers using Raspberry Pi so

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.100 
cluster computers using Raspberry Pi so
I<00:00:31.920> use<00:00:32.250> for<00:00:32.489> raspberry<00:00:32.850> PI's<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.390> created<00:00:33.989> a

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
I use for raspberry PI's and I created a

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.740 
I use for raspberry PI's and I created a
cluster<00:00:34.500> computer<00:00:34.950> now<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.940> got<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.239> lot<00:00:36.719> of

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
cluster computer now I got a lot of

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.100 
cluster computer now I got a lot of
awesome<00:00:37.320> comments<00:00:37.710> on<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:38.730> series<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.420> I

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
awesome comments on that series and I

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.660 
awesome comments on that series and I
got<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.290> lot<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.590> views<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.219> lot<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.579> guys

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
got a lot of views and a lot of you guys

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.369 
got a lot of views and a lot of you guys
really<00:00:42.090> like<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.629> figured<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:43.020> wanted<00:00:43.260> to

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
really like it so I figured I wanted to

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.560 
really like it so I figured I wanted to
get<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.710> next<00:00:44.010> step<00:00:44.399> or<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.820> next<00:00:45.059> level

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
get to the next step or the next level

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.500 
get to the next step or the next level
and<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.050> do<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.500> I'm<00:00:46.680> gonna<00:00:46.800> need<00:00:46.890> your<00:00:47.219> guys

raspberry pies now what's stopping me
from<00:01:13.229> doing<00:01:13.500> this<00:01:13.650> video<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:14.270> it's<00:01:15.270> basically

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
from doing this video is it's basically

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.410 
from doing this video is it's basically
buying<00:01:16.470> all<00:01:16.680> this<00:01:16.770> raspberry<00:01:17.159> pies<00:01:17.340> now<00:01:18.060> each

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
buying all this raspberry pies now each

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.660 
buying all this raspberry pies now each
raspberry<00:01:18.869> pie<00:01:19.020> alone<00:01:19.470> is<00:01:19.680> like<00:01:19.950> 30<00:01:20.220> bucks<00:01:20.460> or

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
raspberry pie alone is like 30 bucks or

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.249 
raspberry pie alone is like 30 bucks or
35<00:01:21.090> bucks<00:01:21.240> it's<00:01:21.450> not<00:01:21.600> really<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:22.020> expensive

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
35 bucks it's not really that expensive

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.460 
35 bucks it's not really that expensive
but<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.830> buy<00:01:22.950> fifty<00:01:23.400> or<00:01:23.520> hundred<00:01:23.640> them<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.689> the

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
but to buy fifty or hundred them the the

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.219 
but to buy fifty or hundred them the the
money<00:01:25.619> adds<00:01:25.860> up<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:26.299> I'm<00:01:27.299> gonna<00:01:27.540> needle<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:28.049> few

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
money adds up so I'm gonna needle a few

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.240 
money adds up so I'm gonna needle a few
thousand<00:01:28.530> dollars<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.829> get<00:01:28.920> this<00:01:29.070> thing

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
thousand dollars to get this thing

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.649 
thousand dollars to get this thing
started<00:01:29.460> but<00:01:30.240> if<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.659> do<00:01:30.720> decide<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:32.360> invest<00:01:33.360> in
