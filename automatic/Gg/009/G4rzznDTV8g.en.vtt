00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:55.159 
also the first-ever computer-aided

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:57.750 
also the first-ever computer-aided
preparations<00:00:56.109> we<00:00:57.109> gave<00:00:57.289> it<00:00:57.440> that<00:00:57.559> name

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
preparations we gave it that name

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.279 
preparations we gave it that name
because<00:00:58.760> the<00:00:59.539> computer<00:01:00.049> actually

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
because the computer actually

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:02.770 
because the computer actually
manipulates<00:01:01.129> the<00:01:01.309> beach<00:01:01.519> the<00:01:01.879> beam<00:01:02.089> pulses<00:01:02.629> up

manipulates the beach the beam pulses up

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.990 
manipulates the beach the beam pulses up
to<00:01:02.899> ten<00:01:03.140> thousand<00:01:03.739> times<00:01:03.920> per<00:01:04.309> second<00:01:04.699> and

it's manipulated by mirrors that are

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.880 
it's manipulated by mirrors that are
driven<00:01:07.789> by<00:01:07.909> gallows<00:01:08.509> galvan<00:01:09.049> offers<00:01:09.380> it<00:01:09.590> also

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
driven by gallows galvan offers it also

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.700

up<00:01:10.369> to<00:01:10.399> ten<00:01:10.729> thousand<00:01:11.240> times<00:01:11.479> per<00:01:11.780> second<00:01:12.229> but

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
up to ten thousand times per second but

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.859 
up to ten thousand times per second but
that<00:01:12.830> means<00:01:13.009> it<00:01:13.310> distributes<00:01:13.789> the<00:01:13.880> beam<00:01:14.149> in<00:01:14.750> a

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
that means it distributes the beam in a

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.380 
that means it distributes the beam in a
way<00:01:14.990> that<00:01:15.259> you<00:01:15.439> could<00:01:15.680> never<00:01:15.950> do

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
a variable-speed wood pedal so just like

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.490 
a variable-speed wood pedal so just like

that's a whole new page of experience

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.039 
that's a whole new page of experience
and<00:01:51.049> 95%<00:01:51.740> of<00:01:52.250> those<00:01:52.310> patients<00:01:52.610> express<00:01:53.509> no

and 95% of those patients express no

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:58.419 
and 95% of those patients express no
discomfort<00:01:54.560> at<00:01:55.009> all<00:01:55.630> so<00:01:56.630> that's<00:01:57.590> that's<00:01:58.130> one

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
discomfort at all so that's that's one

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:00.249 
discomfort at all so that's that's one
aspect<00:01:58.579> of<00:01:59.000> patient<00:01:59.420> experience<00:01:59.479> the<00:02:00.140> other

aspect of patient experience the other

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.260 
aspect of patient experience the other
thing<00:02:00.500> that's<00:02:00.590> different<00:02:00.890> is<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.670> soleá

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
thing that's different is the soleá

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.270 
thing that's different is the soleá
like<00:02:02.869> every<00:02:03.200> heart<00:02:03.409> issues<00:02:03.710> laser<00:02:03.920> for
