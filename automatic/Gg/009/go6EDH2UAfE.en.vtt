of it but del encounter do a little bit
and<00:01:14.060> so<00:01:15.060> forth<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:15.990> might<00:01:16.170> be<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.320> coolest

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
and so forth so might be the coolest

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.039 
and so forth so might be the coolest
because<00:01:17.070> he's<00:01:17.700> going<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.150> have<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.330> little<00:01:18.720> yeah

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
because he's going to have a little yeah

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.560 
because he's going to have a little yeah
they<00:01:19.290> go<00:01:19.409> like<00:01:19.590> scrape<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.220> like<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.030> bone<00:01:21.270> spur

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570

i think is what they called it on his

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.880 
i think is what they called it on his
shoulder<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:24.780> there's<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.320> good<00:01:25.409> chance<00:01:25.619> he<00:01:25.770> may

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
shoulder so there's a good chance he may

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.289 
shoulder so there's a good chance he may
