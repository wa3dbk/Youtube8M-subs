00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.470 
on my tummy like this and it just helps
stabilize<00:03:34.960> the<00:03:35.470> loom<00:03:35.650> and<00:03:35.940> after<00:03:36.940> the<00:03:37.240> whole

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
stabilize the loom and after the whole

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.900 
stabilize the loom and after the whole
rhythm<00:03:38.290> of<00:03:38.440> doing<00:03:38.740> a<00:03:38.830> hairpin<00:03:39.130> lace<00:03:39.310> trip<00:03:39.700> is

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
rhythm of doing a hairpin lace trip is

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.180 
rhythm of doing a hairpin lace trip is
making<00:03:40.270> a<00:03:40.360> stitch<00:03:40.660> and<00:03:40.900> flipping<00:03:41.230> the<00:03:41.320> loom<00:03:41.500> so

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
making a stitch and flipping the loom so

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.370 
making a stitch and flipping the loom so
now<00:03:42.400> I'm<00:03:42.580> going<00:03:42.820> to<00:03:42.910> flip<00:03:43.030> the<00:03:43.270> loom<00:03:43.450> the<00:03:44.140> first

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
now I'm going to flip the loom the first

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.620 
now I'm going to flip the loom the first
thing<00:03:44.590> I<00:03:44.680> do<00:03:44.740> when<00:03:44.980> I<00:03:45.100> flip<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.520> loom<00:03:45.730> is<00:03:46.360> I'm

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
thing I do when I flip the loom is I'm

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.280 
thing I do when I flip the loom is I'm
going<00:03:47.020> to<00:03:47.290> twist<00:03:47.770> my<00:03:48.190> crochet<00:03:48.730> hook<00:03:49.110> so<00:03:50.110> that

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
going to twist my crochet hook so that

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.690 
going to twist my crochet hook so that
it's<00:03:50.410> essentially<00:03:50.890> upside<00:03:51.280> down<00:03:51.460> on<00:03:51.610> the

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
it's essentially upside down on the

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.340 
it's essentially upside down on the
right<00:03:51.880> side<00:03:52.120> of<00:03:52.240> the<00:03:52.330> loom<00:03:52.510> then<00:03:53.080> I'm<00:03:53.170> going<00:03:53.320> to

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
right side of the loom then I'm going to

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.650 
right side of the loom then I'm going to
take<00:03:53.500> my<00:03:53.680> hook<00:03:53.890> holding<00:03:54.280> hand<00:03:54.580> and<00:03:55.330> I'm<00:03:55.480> going

Loom again and I'm going to keep doing
the<00:04:25.210> same<00:04:25.290> thing<00:04:26.310> you<00:04:27.310> don't<00:04:27.460> make<00:04:27.580> a<00:04:27.610> minor

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
the same thing you don't make a minor

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:28.940 
the same thing you don't make a minor
adjustment<00:04:28.120> down<00:04:28.630> there

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.720 
over two loops on my hook yarn over pull
through<00:04:35.820> there's<00:04:36.450> a<00:04:36.540> stitch<00:04:37.460> bring<00:04:38.460> the<00:04:38.580> hook

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
through there's a stitch bring the hook

over to the backside of the loom flip
the<00:04:40.740> loom<00:04:40.950> do<00:04:41.580> another<00:04:41.880> stitch<00:04:42.330> always

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
the loom do another stitch always

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.810 
the loom do another stitch always

prong<00:04:48.300> of<00:04:48.480> the<00:04:48.540> loom<00:04:48.810> and<00:04:49.230> this<00:04:50.070> is<00:04:50.460> a<00:04:51.000> very

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
prong of the loom and this is a very

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.480 
prong of the loom and this is a very
repetitive<00:04:52.170> movement<00:04:52.920> I'm<00:04:53.100> going<00:04:53.250> to<00:04:53.310> do<00:04:53.370> the

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
repetitive movement I'm going to do the

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.900 
repetitive movement I'm going to do the
same<00:04:53.700> thing<00:04:54.000> again<00:04:54.960> and<00:04:55.350> again<00:04:56.250> and<00:04:56.550> again

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
same thing again and again and again

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.410 
same thing again and again and again
it's<00:04:57.210> incredibly<00:04:57.840> meditative<00:04:59.420> incredibly

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
it's incredibly meditative incredibly

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.090 
it's incredibly meditative incredibly

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
all you're doing is the same motion

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.770 
all you're doing is the same motion
again<00:05:10.620> and<00:05:11.310> again<00:05:11.550> and<00:05:11.700> again<00:05:11.940> until<00:05:12.270> you<00:05:12.450> get

again and again and again until you get

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.790 
again and again and again until you get

it and if your pattern says you know do

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.440 
it and if your pattern says you know do
100<00:05:24.870> loops<00:05:25.170> or<00:05:26.010> do<00:05:26.280> you<00:05:26.790> know<00:05:26.910> however<00:05:27.150> many

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
100 loops or do you know however many

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.510 
100 loops or do you know however many
loops<00:05:27.900> what<00:05:28.530> you're<00:05:28.680> counting<00:05:29.070> are<00:05:29.160> the<00:05:29.310> loops

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
loops what you're counting are the loops

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.070 
loops what you're counting are the loops
on<00:05:29.700> each<00:05:29.850> side<00:05:30.150> so<00:05:30.420> for<00:05:30.540> example<00:05:30.900> in<00:05:30.960> this

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
on each side so for example in this

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.780 
on each side so for example in this
really<00:05:31.410> little<00:05:31.680> strip<00:05:31.950> that<00:05:32.100> I've<00:05:32.250> got<00:05:32.430> going

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:32.790 
really little strip that I've got going

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.690 
really little strip that I've got going
on<00:05:32.910> right<00:05:33.120> now<00:05:33.150> I've<00:05:33.630> done<00:05:33.930> one<00:05:34.620> two<00:05:35.160> three

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700 
on right now I've done one two three

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.560 
on right now I've done one two three
four<00:05:36.090> five<00:05:36.450> six<00:05:36.990> seven<00:05:37.410> eight<00:05:38.180> nine<00:05:39.180> ten

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
four five six seven eight nine ten

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.360 
four five six seven eight nine ten
eleven<00:05:40.020> twelve<00:05:40.110> thirteen<00:05:40.290> fourteen<00:05:40.590> so<00:05:41.220> this

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
eleven twelve thirteen fourteen so this

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.640 
eleven twelve thirteen fourteen so this
is<00:05:41.550> a<00:05:41.580> fourteen<00:05:42.120> loop<00:05:42.360> strip<00:05:42.780> at<00:05:43.110> this<00:05:43.380> point

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
is a fourteen loop strip at this point

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.850 
is a fourteen loop strip at this point
in<00:05:43.770> time<00:05:43.950> and<00:05:44.510> so<00:05:45.510> for<00:05:45.840> the<00:05:46.050> pattern<00:05:46.620> that's

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
in time and so for the pattern that's

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.710

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 
sure there's hundreds of loops I'm

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:57.380 
sure there's hundreds of loops I'm
wearing<00:05:52.140> a<00:05:54.440> a<00:05:55.700> garment<00:05:56.700> right<00:05:56.850> now<00:05:57.060> that's

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
wearing a a garment right now that's

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.630 
wearing a a garment right now that's
filled<00:05:57.750> with<00:05:57.870> tons<00:05:58.500> and<00:05:58.650> tons<00:05:58.740> of<00:05:59.130> loops<00:05:59.400> and

00:05:59.630 --> 00:05:59.640 
filled with tons and tons of loops and

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.180 
filled with tons and tons of loops and
I've<00:05:59.790> joined<00:06:00.030> them<00:06:00.270> together<00:06:00.450> and<00:06:01.190> actually
