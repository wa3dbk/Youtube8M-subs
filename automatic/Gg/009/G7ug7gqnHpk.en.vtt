00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:12.220 

okay<00:00:06.629> I'm<00:00:06.779> going<00:00:06.990> up<00:00:07.230> on<00:00:08.480> reds<00:00:09.480> with<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:11.030> Eddy

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.230 
okay I'm going up on reds with the Eddy

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:19.630 
okay I'm going up on reds with the Eddy
and<00:00:13.969> this<00:00:14.969> is<00:00:15.150> on<00:00:15.410> lava<00:00:16.410> rope<00:00:16.910> so<00:00:17.910> it's<00:00:18.119> a

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
and this is on lava rope so it's a

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.040 
and this is on lava rope so it's a
pretty<00:00:20.640> good<00:00:20.760> sized<00:00:21.150> rope<00:00:21.510> it's<00:00:21.750> really

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
pretty good sized rope it's really

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.660 
pretty good sized rope it's really
bigger<00:00:22.260> an<00:00:22.410> 11<00:00:22.800> millimeter<00:00:23.900> but<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:25.519> lot<00:00:26.519> of

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
bigger an 11 millimeter but a lot of

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.580 
bigger an 11 millimeter but a lot of
people<00:00:26.970> use<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.570> poison<00:00:27.960> ivy<00:00:28.140> which<00:00:28.470> is

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
people use it and poison ivy which is

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.250 
people use it and poison ivy which is
about<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.980> same<00:00:29.250> diameter<00:00:29.490> so<00:00:30.029> let's<00:00:30.960> see<00:00:31.080> how

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
about the same diameter so let's see how

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.709 
about the same diameter so let's see how
it<00:00:31.380> does<00:00:31.700> again<00:00:32.700> I'm<00:00:32.880> using<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.300> mirror<00:00:33.510> image

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
it does again I'm using a mirror image

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.420 
it does again I'm using a mirror image
because<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.559> way<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.829> rope<00:00:35.070> threads

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
because of the way the rope threads

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.069 
because of the way the rope threads
through<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.880> Eddy

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
through the Eddy

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.350 
through the Eddy
so<00:00:38.040> we'll<00:00:38.309> just<00:00:38.489> see<00:00:38.700> how<00:00:38.879> this<00:00:39.059> works<00:00:41.360> having

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
so we'll just see how this works having

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.549 
so we'll just see how this works having
that<00:00:42.540> same<00:00:42.870> problem<00:00:43.260> ahead<00:00:43.850> for<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:45.059> my<00:00:45.559> Eddy

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
that same problem ahead for of my Eddy

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.940 
that same problem ahead for of my Eddy
hitting<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:48.230> carabiner<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.500> hooks<00:00:49.770> my

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
hitting that carabiner that hooks my

00:00:49.950 --> 00:01:58.150 
hitting that carabiner that hooks my
foot<00:00:51.410> must<00:00:52.410> not<00:00:52.649> be<00:00:52.860> too<00:00:53.100> bad

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.520 

okay<00:01:59.160> I'm<00:02:00.150> gonna<00:02:00.450> see<00:02:01.130> this<00:02:02.130> thing<00:02:02.400> feels<00:02:02.790> like

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
okay I'm gonna see this thing feels like

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:18.730 
okay I'm gonna see this thing feels like
going<00:02:04.530> down<00:02:04.920> Oh<00:02:09.050> it'sit's<00:02:10.050> fine<00:02:10.410> on<00:02:10.850> big<00:02:11.850> girl

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:28.210 

yes<00:02:19.740> easy<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:21.510> big<00:02:21.750> stuff

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.480 

in<00:02:28.580> fact<00:02:28.790> I<00:02:29.000> over<00:02:29.390> pulled<00:02:29.690> on<00:02:30.500> purpose<00:02:31.220> and<00:02:31.370> it

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
in fact I over pulled on purpose and it

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.820 
in fact I over pulled on purpose and it
locked<00:02:31.760> down<00:02:34.570> I'm<00:02:35.570> not<00:02:35.720> sure<00:02:36.020> I'm<00:02:36.170> crazy<00:02:36.530> about

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
locked down I'm not sure I'm crazy about

00:02:36.830 --> 00:03:08.140 
locked down I'm not sure I'm crazy about
that<00:02:36.890> but<00:02:37.630> it's<00:02:38.630> alright

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:16.820 

it's<00:03:09.150> interesting

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.960 

that<00:03:17.830> was<00:03:18.010> an<00:03:18.130> over<00:03:18.490> pool<00:03:18.760> or<00:03:19.030> a<00:03:19.080> panic<00:03:20.080> pulled

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
that was an over pool or a panic pulled

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.790 
that was an over pool or a panic pulled
once<00:03:21.970> it<00:03:22.360> locks<00:03:22.600> in<00:03:22.960> that<00:03:22.990> way<00:03:23.320> you<00:03:23.530> have<00:03:23.680> to

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
once it locks in that way you have to

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.460 
once it locks in that way you have to
push<00:03:24.010> this<00:03:24.160> back<00:03:24.490> up<00:03:24.730> and<00:03:25.110> when<00:03:26.110> you<00:03:26.200> do<00:03:26.350> it

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
push this back up and when you do it

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.000 
push this back up and when you do it
locks<00:03:26.770> that<00:03:27.010> way<00:03:27.250> you<00:03:28.180> can<00:03:28.360> start<00:03:28.660> again

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
locks that way you can start again

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.350 
locks that way you can start again
there's<00:03:30.010> a<00:03:30.100> little<00:03:30.400> spot<00:03:30.730> in<00:03:30.970> there<00:03:31.150> that's

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
there's a little spot in there that's

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.670 
there's a little spot in there that's
really<00:03:31.660> loose<00:03:32.400> it<00:03:33.400> kitch<00:03:33.700> it's<00:03:33.940> pretty<00:03:34.150> quick
