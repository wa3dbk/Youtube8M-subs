00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:07.010
 the percentage of overweight people and more and more 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.389
 high in developed countries 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.049
 because of a part of an unbalanced diet and too rich in 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.619
 fats and sugars 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:19.650
 and on the other hand of our way of life which has greatly diminished our 

00:00:19.649 --> 00:00:22.650
 physical activity 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.340
 but let's start by explaining the role of leptin in understanding why 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.800
 the percentage of overweight population is increasing 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.190
 constant 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.080
 when you eat the fat cells produce leptin 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.810
 who is responsible for sending a message to the brain 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.770
 when the amount produced and sufficiency the brain triggers a sound 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.380
 for sending two messages 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.830
 the first created the sensation of satiety to prevent you from eating 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.950
 more than necessary 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:56.940
 and the second 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.439
 of order to the fat cells to burn the fat that is surplus 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.310
 leptin plays an important role since it is she who naturally 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.310
 regulates weight 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.820
 but what happens when we eat too much 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.890
 and that our fat mass does not exceed a certain threshold 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.240
 the leptin level becomes too important 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.340
 and the brain is no longer able to interpret his message and he 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.560
 continues to make the individual believe that he is still hungry 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.650
 and he no longer gives the order to burn fat 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:34.520
 so 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.520
 we also take real but devilish power 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.000
 the action of leptin was discovered about 10 years ago he has 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 raised tremendous hopes in the treatment of obesity 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.500
 at the beginning it was believed that the leptin level in the blood is not increased 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.380
 would have convincing results 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.290
 and it's the inverted that happened 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.840
 We realized that in reality we had to reduce this leptin 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.930
 that the brain correctly interprets the information provided by the 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.239
 fat cells 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.829
 precisely for that my duras has come up with a product called eat 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:18.950
 crime and whose action will simply be to reduce leptin 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.950
 42% 

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:25.340
 so the yo-yo effect that accompany 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.399
 often the end of a diet have been eliminated 

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:32.359
 since we simply allow the body to function 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:34.789
 in a natural way 

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:39.319
 of course it's better to eat better and more balanced and to 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.409
 to do a little physical exercise if only a daily walk for 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:45.999
 speed up the process 

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:50.010
 miracle products do not exist and if you spend some of your 

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:54.339
 days to nibble constantly lying in your couch watching 

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:58.370
 television you will have little chance of having quick results 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:05.829
 double-blind clinical tests we have of course been performed on two 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:06.439
 month 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:09.529
 and the results surprised everyone 

00:03:09.529 --> 00:03:13.679
 the people who had eaten the crime will lose on average 10 

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:15.760
 pounds of body fat 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.329
 he gets their year their silhouette since they lost on average ten 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.350
 centimeters of waist 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.120
 him all to the comma three centimeters at the hips and 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.099
 three centimeters to each 6 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.669
 but what surprised most the scientists who participated in 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:33.539
 tests 

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:35.129
 it is that afterwards 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:38.129
 these people no longer gained weight 

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:43.530
 crime mentoring comes in the form of capsules 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.760
 100% natural only herbal it thinks without preservatives 

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:50.819
 so they are very safe 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:51.809
 eure and no 

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:53.849
 no side effects 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:58.359
 the use of the mend repressed very simple since it is enough to take 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:01.829
 two morning agen capsules and evening capsules 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.709
 count 4 boxes of 28 capsules for 1 month 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.269
 less than 3 euros per day 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:16.680
 this presentation of mans duras prime is coming to an end and we thank you 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.609
 of your attention 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.060
 contact now the representative of honduras who has you 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.030
 allowed to view this video so that it can respond to your 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.900
 possible questions and guide you to place your order in any 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:30.080
