 hello everyone today we will 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.129
 prepare sand rings with baby and 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.699
 Zoro and pro for cooking us 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:17.250
 need three cups of flour 2 eggs 200 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:20.189
 gram margarine or butter 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.670
 a glass of sugar a glass of peanuts a little 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:27.190
 soda vinegar and salt 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.530
 knead the dough for this we take 200 grams 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:33.360
 margarine or butter 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:38.440
 but should be at room temperature 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.810
 softened and mix it with a glass 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.989
 sugar which we transform sugar 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.989
 powder 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:54.160
 powdered sugar can be easily made from 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:57.010
 sugar using coffee grinder coffee grinder 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.339
 magnify sapr all state of sugar 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.339
 powder 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.340
 Now the dough need add eggs but one 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.340
 yolk we need to leave for lubrication 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:30.490
 save and keep points and add 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:33.369
 eggs in the dough to shea curled in 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:37.060
 we need products to be all 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:51.099
 the same temperature, beat the butter 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:53.610
 add a little egg at will 

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:56.939
 vanillin 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.939
 a pinch of salt 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:10.799
 stir to dissolve salt 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:10.799
 while we have gone out of court 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:19.120
 soda needs about half a teaspoon 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:23.650
 add a few drops of vinegar 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.650
 Vinegar 6 percent dining room 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.830
 extinguish soda 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.960
 now add to the vessels in the dough 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:51.550
 pour out 3 cups of flour knead 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.550
 homogeneous plastic dough 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.450
 flour may need even cycle more 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:07.390
 on the floor of such 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:10.050
 because eggs are different small 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.050
 large 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.220
 I repeat that flour can 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.890
 need a little more or a little less 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:31.450
 depending on the size and the case is about 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.450
 I will add half a cup 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.030
 kneaded dough spread on food 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.030
 film 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.650
 wrap and remove it for half an hour 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.650
 fridge 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.110
 we will still fry and grind and be born 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.540
 peanuts pour into the pan and 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:15.260
 fry it until ready readiness 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.250
 check for taste 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.790
 fried Olezhki need slightly 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.790
 chop 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:34.410
 cold dough roll into the reservoir 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:44.400
 about 75 millimeters thick but 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:47.060
 slightly fitted surface now 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:52.550
 with the help of molds or just here you can 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.550
 use sawing cut rings 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.950
 large diameter 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:05.100
 and inside do a little hole 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:20.090
 Ringlets retake on the board and remove 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.220
 them in the freezer so they are lightly 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:25.240
 simple 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.240
 to make it easier to work with them 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:32.800
 made frozen pods we grease 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.800
 an egg 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:43.400
 from kneaded dough are usually obtained 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.400
 somewhere pieces 12 ringlets 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.600
 I repeat before processing which 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.490
 now we need ringlets 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.450
 freeze to be sure that with them 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.450
 it was convenient to work 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:11.170
 Now every ring we dip in 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:15.240
 mug and spread on a baking sheet 

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:15.240
 do not need to grease the pan 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:35.270
 set the oven to warm up to 200 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.890
 degrees and send rings for baking 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:41.440
 to the river baked 

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:46.010
 average -12 one pan 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:47.930
 here the main thing is not to overcook not to give them 

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:51.190
 reddens then the rings will be 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.190
 airy gentle 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:58.770
 prepared rings are sent to 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:01.050
 baking in the oven once again 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:04.229
 Preheat oven to 200 degrees 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:06.660
 rings bake no more than 12 minutes to them 

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:09.180
 you can not give reddened otherwise they are not 

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:11.630
 get crumbly so light 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:14.520
 air like ringlets from our childhood 

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:16.800
 I want to draw attention to the fact that it is 

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:19.110
 baking does not belong to the category of light and 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.710
 requires certain skills to work with 

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:21.710
 sand dough 

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:31.120
 flew 12 minutes our rings are ready 

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:33.640
 I hope you enjoy this recipe. 

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:36.880
 bake with pleasure let u 

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:39.870
 you all turns out right the first time is bad 

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.870
 very good bye
