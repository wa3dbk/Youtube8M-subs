00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:12.269
 as it is so dear friends we are here 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.870
 once again in the program the magic of 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.630
 tax in return and a I will prepare a 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.550
 macerated and I'm returning medium but 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.990
 have to make more ice cream thanks to my 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.440
 great friends who teach me by 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.350
 supposedly enriched recipes 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.230
 today we are going to prepare a macerated 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:34.260
 wonder is super simple and above me 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.430
 I deserve it I love it and of course 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.100
 as I always say 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.010
 for each record there is a perfect match 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.470
 and for me definitely for everything 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.260
 tea that is such an expressive work and so 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:50.170
 intense the wonder 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:54.129
 will enhance the characteristics of the 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:56.650
 fruit and pisco not then what is it 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:01:02.050
 what are we going to do here are six 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:05.170
 blame of sea cool skill not the 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:08.770
 let's put in a jar 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:12.340
 and then we're going to put a bottle of 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:17.640
 pisco that there are half a liter of the grape 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.640
 torontel look how simple 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:26.410
 look what delight yes and then simply 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:30.150
 we are not going to move a little bit so that 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.150
 assemble well and you are 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:38.260
 but this has to rest here in the 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.140
 jar has just to macerate about 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:44.350
 12 days approximately 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.810
 after 12 days you will strain 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.000
 so that it only remains in the suite of 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.550
 juice not like in this case for example 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.010
 that I have a strawberry macerate not that 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.050
 after some days I've already taken the 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.560
 strawberries and I look good wanting the 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.630
 colour 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.649
 only the maxilla 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.649
 and this is so 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.189
 future will be 12 travel to have the 

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:10.679
 macerated to enjoy it as you want a 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:12.580
 cigarillo or in cocktails 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.150
 ah 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.150
 ah
