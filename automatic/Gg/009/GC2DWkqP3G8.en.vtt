 Cooked 10 minutes with a little piece of 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:31.700
 salt aside let's use 160 grams of 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:34.650
 tuna which is equivalent to 2 cans 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:38.040
 small of those preserved 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.990
 and three tablespoons of mayonnaise 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.700
 with only this we are going to do our 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.700

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.230
 is half of these four buds with 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:57.469
 We will reserve a bit of tuna for 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:01.269

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.269
 other yolks we add the tuna 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.930
 we mix it lightly 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.299
 finally we add the mesh 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.830
 when we have it well mixed 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.830
 we will begin to fill them all 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.380
 once all already well mixed and only 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.340
 we are left with a spoon and 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.340
 stuffing the eggs 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:39.890
 half of what they are invited 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.890
 we are putting we match a little 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:47.170
 and we're going to put this on the plate 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.170
 let's do with all 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.119
 we have the eggs here as you see the 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.860
 we put on a bed of lettuce 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.640
 now we only have four 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.960
 half buds that we had reserved 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.780
 take a little bit over each 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.899
 egg 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.700
 and finally we will give you a little 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.960
 also tuna 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:18.010
 so that it looks like this at a glance 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:21.939
 in the eggs as they take turns 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:25.379
 well we identify the egg the content 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:25.379
 In the first moment 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.340
 and we have everything 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.090

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.090
 little piece of 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.769
 that I am comfortable in each house is made 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.790
 in a way you can add many more 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:57.030
 ingredients as I say this each to 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:00.510

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.970
 ideal for spring to summer that makes 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.160
 warmth fancy something cold what 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.459
