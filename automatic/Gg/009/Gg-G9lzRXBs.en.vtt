00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:15.829 

all<00:00:12.929> right<00:00:13.700> since<00:00:14.700> we<00:00:14.820> had<00:00:15.000> to<00:00:15.150> replace<00:00:15.450> the

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
all right since we had to replace the

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.929 
all right since we had to replace the
connecting<00:00:16.619> rod<00:00:17.359> on<00:00:18.359> this<00:00:18.630> engine<00:00:19.730> we<00:00:20.730> got<00:00:20.910> a

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
connecting rod on this engine we got a

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.560 
connecting rod on this engine we got a
new<00:00:21.119> one<00:00:25.609> we<00:00:26.609> need<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:26.880> install<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.539> new

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
new one we need to install the new

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.400 
new one we need to install the new
connecting<00:00:28.170> rod<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.680> piston<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:30.260> so<00:00:31.260> what

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
connecting rod to the piston and so what

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.030 
connecting rod to the piston and so what
I<00:00:31.439> did<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:31.890> took<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.969> retaining<00:00:33.390> clip

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
I did is I took the the retaining clip

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:44.840 
I did is I took the the retaining clip
from<00:00:35.040> here<00:00:43.100> now<00:00:44.100> we'll<00:00:44.250> just<00:00:44.399> slide<00:00:44.610> it

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
from here now we'll just slide it

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:52.279 
from here now we'll just slide it
through<00:00:45.860> connecting<00:00:46.860> rod<00:00:47.039> like<00:00:47.250> so<00:00:51.140> make<00:00:52.140> sure

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
through connecting rod like so make sure

00:00:52.289 --> 00:01:01.279 
through connecting rod like so make sure
it's<00:00:52.410> all<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.620> way<00:00:52.710> in<00:00:52.739> place<00:01:00.079> now<00:01:01.079> this

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
it's all the way in place now this

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.759 
it's all the way in place now this
particular<00:01:01.469> piston<00:01:03.470> doesn't<00:01:04.470> have<00:01:04.619> any

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
particular piston doesn't have any

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.920 
particular piston doesn't have any
indication<00:01:05.369> on<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.729> some<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.270> them<00:01:06.510> have<00:01:06.689> an

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
indication on it some of them have an

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.730 
indication on it some of them have an
arrow<00:01:07.250> that<00:01:08.250> would<00:01:08.369> point<00:01:08.610> toward<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.740> D

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
arrow that would point toward the D

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.550 
arrow that would point toward the D
intake<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.340> exhaust<00:01:11.640> ports<00:01:12.380> this<00:01:13.380> one

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
intake in the exhaust ports this one

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.679 
intake in the exhaust ports this one
doesn't<00:01:13.770> have<00:01:13.920> any<00:01:14.280> such<00:01:14.580> markings<00:01:15.509> on<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:17.689> so

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
doesn't have any such markings on it so

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.260 
doesn't have any such markings on it so
I<00:01:19.110> can<00:01:20.070> only<00:01:20.159> guess<00:01:20.460> which<00:01:20.759> way<00:01:20.939> it's<00:01:21.060> going<00:01:21.180> to

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
I can only guess which way it's going to

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:33.289 
I can only guess which way it's going to
go<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:30.079> take<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.200> ring<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:32.119> we'll<00:01:33.119> make<00:01:33.270> sure

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
go I take the ring and we'll make sure

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:49.730 
go I take the ring and we'll make sure
that<00:01:33.450> this<00:01:33.570> ring<00:01:33.810> get<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.049> push<00:01:34.229> back<00:01:34.409> in<00:01:34.619> place

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.890 

they're<00:01:50.310> going<00:01:51.830> now<00:01:52.830> the<00:01:52.890> connecting<00:01:53.460> rod<00:01:53.900> is

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
they're going now the connecting rod is

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:03.080 
they're going now the connecting rod is
in<00:01:55.320> place<00:01:55.590> on<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.670> piston<00:01:57.060> work<00:01:57.510> belongs<00:02:02.090> I've

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
in place on the piston work belongs I've

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.449 
in place on the piston work belongs I've
already<00:02:03.509> inserted<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:04.050> new<00:02:04.229> rings<00:02:05.060> and

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
already inserted the new rings and

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:12.140 
already inserted the new rings and
before<00:02:08.459> we<00:02:08.580> insert<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.899> piston<00:02:10.410> into<00:02:11.150> the

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
before we insert the piston into the

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.900 
before we insert the piston into the
block<00:02:14.690> we<00:02:15.690> need<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:15.900> make<00:02:16.319> sure<00:02:16.440> that<00:02:16.620> these

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
block we need to make sure that these

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.600 
block we need to make sure that these
gaps<00:02:17.910> in<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.540> Rings<00:02:18.780> are<00:02:19.170> staggered<00:02:19.770> and<00:02:20.459> I

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
gaps in the Rings are staggered and I

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.000 
gaps in the Rings are staggered and I
usually<00:02:20.760> stay<00:02:21.090> with<00:02:21.270> them<00:02:21.390> about<00:02:22.380> 180<00:02:22.920> degrees

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
usually stay with them about 180 degrees

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.360 
usually stay with them about 180 degrees
from<00:02:23.430> each<00:02:23.610> other<00:02:24.290> so<00:02:25.290> put<00:02:26.070> that<00:02:26.220> one<00:02:26.340> over

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
from each other so put that one over

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:37.220 
from each other so put that one over
there<00:02:33.050> put<00:02:34.050> that<00:02:34.260> one<00:02:34.380> over<00:02:34.470> there<00:02:34.739> and<00:02:36.230> we'll

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
there put that one over there and we'll

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.380 
there put that one over there and we'll
leave<00:02:37.380> that<00:02:37.560> one<00:02:37.940> right<00:02:38.940> we'll<00:02:39.090> leave<00:02:39.239> that

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
leave that one right we'll leave that

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.220 
leave that one right we'll leave that
one<00:02:39.480> here<00:02:39.690> by<00:02:39.840> this<00:02:39.989> hole

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.420 

let's<00:02:43.230> take<00:02:43.410> of<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.650> other<00:02:43.830> two<00:02:43.980> away<00:02:44.220> from

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
let's take of the other two away from

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:58.290 
let's take of the other two away from
the<00:02:44.519> hole<00:02:45.080> so<00:02:46.080> like<00:02:46.650> so

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.360 

you
