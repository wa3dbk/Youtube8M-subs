00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.249 
maneuverability obviously it tilt
telescoping<00:01:38.369> steering<00:01:38.789> wheel<00:01:39.060> nice<00:01:39.630> easy<00:01:40.020> to

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
telescoping steering wheel nice easy to

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.899 
telescoping steering wheel nice easy to
read<00:01:40.440> gauges<00:01:41.009> here<00:01:41.190> we've<00:01:41.399> got<00:01:41.550> kind<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:41.819> a

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
read gauges here we've got kind of a

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.240 
read gauges here we've got kind of a
grey<00:01:42.149> background<00:01:42.450> on<00:01:43.080> them<00:01:43.229> for<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.860> daylight

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
grey background on them for the daylight

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.539 
grey background on them for the daylight
so<00:01:44.520> that's<00:01:44.700> easy<00:01:44.940> to<00:01:45.149> see<00:01:46.310> the<00:01:47.310> push-button

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
so that's easy to see the push-button

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.419 
so that's easy to see the push-button
start<00:01:48.030> which<00:01:48.690> is<00:01:48.899> basically<00:01:49.350> your<00:01:49.590> concerting

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
start which is basically your concerting

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:53.690 
start which is basically your concerting
your<00:01:50.549> key<00:01:50.869> key<00:01:51.869> fob<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.649> push<00:01:53.190> it<00:01:53.340> in<00:01:53.490> and

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
your key key fob in and push it in and

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.070 
your key key fob in and push it in and
it<00:01:53.819> starts<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.240> car<00:01:54.479> up<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:54.869> way<00:01:55.049> so

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
it starts the car up that way so

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.050 
it starts the car up that way so
something<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.709> little<00:01:55.920> different<00:01:56.310> automatic

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
something a little different automatic

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.690 
something a little different automatic

you can kind of cruise up and down that

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.960 
you can kind of cruise up and down that
way<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.289> prefer<00:02:10.979> buttons<00:02:11.340> myself<00:02:11.850> a

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:17.609 
across here a little volume knob there

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:19.849 
across here a little volume knob there
we<00:02:18.180> also<00:02:18.299> have<00:02:18.630> a<00:02:18.660> little<00:02:18.900> volume<00:02:19.320> knob<00:02:19.530> on<00:02:19.709> the

we also have a little volume knob on the

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:21.949 
we also have a little volume knob on the
steering<00:02:20.190> wheel<00:02:20.280> a<00:02:20.430> little<00:02:20.600> scroller<00:02:21.600> here

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
steering wheel a little scroller here

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.759 
steering wheel a little scroller here
and<00:02:23.540> really<00:02:24.540> pretty<00:02:24.750> easy<00:02:24.959> to<00:02:25.200> figure<00:02:25.380> out<00:02:25.620> all

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
and really pretty easy to figure out all

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.400 
and really pretty easy to figure out all
the<00:02:25.890> controls<00:02:26.280> here<00:02:26.519> so<00:02:26.700> I<00:02:26.730> like<00:02:27.030> that<00:02:27.410> not

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
the controls here so I like that not

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.349 
the controls here so I like that not
much<00:02:28.650> in<00:02:28.829> the<00:02:28.890> way<00:02:28.920> of<00:02:29.040> Sun<00:02:29.340> visors<00:02:29.790> obviously

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:30.359 
much in the way of Sun visors obviously

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:31.580 
much in the way of Sun visors obviously
if<00:02:30.420> you<00:02:30.510> get<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.810> roof<00:02:30.959> down<00:02:31.140> that's<00:02:31.380> not<00:02:31.470> a

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
if you get the roof down that's not a

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.650 
if you get the roof down that's not a
big<00:02:31.859> deal<00:02:32.070> but<00:02:32.250> in<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.609> wintertime<00:02:33.030> driving

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
big deal but in the wintertime driving

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.690 
big deal but in the wintertime driving
around<00:02:33.840> sometimes<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.560> Sun<00:02:34.799> gets<00:02:35.010> low<00:02:35.220> you'd

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
around sometimes the Sun gets low you'd

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.979 
around sometimes the Sun gets low you'd
like<00:02:35.850> to<00:02:35.970> have<00:02:36.060> a<00:02:36.090> little<00:02:36.299> bit<00:02:36.480> bigger<00:02:36.690> visor

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
like to have a little bit bigger visor

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.289 
like to have a little bit bigger visor
than<00:02:37.350> that<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:37.769> in<00:02:38.370> this<00:02:38.489> particular<00:02:38.670> car<00:02:39.269> has

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
than that and in this particular car has

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.900 
than that and in this particular car has
a<00:02:39.540> fancier<00:02:40.079> trim<00:02:40.380> level<00:02:40.709> on<00:02:40.859> here<00:02:41.190> so<00:02:41.640> it<00:02:41.730> has<00:02:41.790> a

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
a fancier trim level on here so it has a

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:48.360 
a fancier trim level on here so it has a
kind<00:02:42.150> of<00:02:42.239> a<00:02:42.329> carbon-fiber<00:02:42.959> look<00:02:43.350> in<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.590> door

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.660 

so<00:02:49.370> we're<00:02:49.519> taking<00:02:49.640> a<00:02:49.790> little<00:02:49.970> spin<00:02:50.120> in<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:51.670> s5

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
so we're taking a little spin in the s5

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.640 
so we're taking a little spin in the s5
this<00:02:53.030> is<00:02:53.180> a<00:02:53.209> got<00:02:53.690> a<00:02:53.720> lot<00:02:53.900> of<00:02:53.989> power<00:02:54.170> here<00:02:54.290> with<00:02:54.590> a

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
this is a got a lot of power here with a

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:55.960 
this is a got a lot of power here with a
supercharged<00:02:55.400> engine

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
supercharged engine

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.040 
supercharged engine
you<00:02:56.569> can<00:02:56.690> probably<00:02:56.930> feel<00:02:57.260> that

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
you can probably feel that

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.310 
you can probably feel that
here<00:02:59.590> that<00:03:00.420> got<00:03:01.420> the<00:03:01.540> roof<00:03:01.720> down<00:03:01.900> so<00:03:02.080> we<00:03:02.140> get<00:03:02.260> a

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
here that got the roof down so we get a

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.050 
here that got the roof down so we get a
little<00:03:02.590> more<00:03:02.710> sound<00:03:03.070> even<00:03:03.790> though<00:03:03.880> it's<00:03:04.000> a

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
little more sound even though it's a

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.910 
little more sound even though it's a

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
convertible it's really fairly quiet in

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.300 
convertible it's really fairly quiet in
the<00:03:06.010> car<00:03:06.220> man<00:03:06.490> the<00:03:06.580> roof<00:03:06.790> stop
