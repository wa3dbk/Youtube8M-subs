00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
no there today I'm going to show you how

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.949 
no there today I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:01.800> add<00:00:02.760> a<00:00:02.820> computer<00:00:03.210> to<00:00:03.480> Active<00:00:03.840> Directory

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
to add a computer to Active Directory

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:05.630 
to add a computer to Active Directory
users<00:00:04.230> and<00:00:04.620> computers<00:00:04.710> so

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
users and computers so

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:12.950 
users and computers so
control-alt-delete<00:00:06.569> and<00:00:06.870> login<00:00:11.480> so<00:00:12.480> this

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
control-alt-delete and login so this

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.499 
control-alt-delete and login so this
allows<00:00:13.259> me<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.009> join<00:00:14.340> machines<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.150> domain

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
allows me to join machines to the domain

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.930 
allows me to join machines to the domain
it's<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.410> good<00:00:16.529> idea<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.949> make<00:00:17.190> your<00:00:17.430> accounts

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
it's a good idea to make your accounts

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.609 
it's a good idea to make your accounts
before<00:00:18.420> you<00:00:18.539> actually<00:00:18.840> join<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.109> machines<00:00:19.470> to

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
before you actually join the machines to

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:20.840 
before you actually join the machines to
the<00:00:19.680> domain<00:00:20.010> because<00:00:20.189> you<00:00:20.250> can<00:00:20.369> have<00:00:20.460> more

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
the domain because you can have more

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.790 
the domain because you can have more
control<00:00:21.210> over<00:00:21.740> where<00:00:22.740> they<00:00:22.890> go<00:00:23.750> because<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.960> by

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
control over where they go because a by

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.580 
control over where they go because a by
default<00:00:26.250> it's<00:00:26.640> gonna<00:00:26.849> put<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.300> people<00:00:28.199> in<00:00:28.380> the

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
default it's gonna put the people in the

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
it's gonna put people in users and

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.870 
it's gonna put people in users and
Active<00:00:32.250> Directory<00:00:32.719> computers<00:00:33.719> into

Active Directory computers into

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.930 
Active Directory computers into
computers<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.270> we<00:00:36.480> go<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.899> admin<00:00:37.260> tools<00:00:37.940> Active

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940

says assign this computer as a pre
Windows<00:01:13.320> 2000<00:01:13.950> computer<00:01:14.250> it's<00:01:14.400> not<00:01:14.540> and<00:01:15.619> then

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
Windows 2000 computer it's not and then

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:17.899 
Windows 2000 computer it's not and then
that's<00:01:16.799> pretty<00:01:16.890> much<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.400> we<00:01:17.580> can<00:01:17.729> right<00:01:17.880> click

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
more options here so once the computers

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.350 
more options here so once the computers
actually<00:01:22.560> joined<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.280> domain<00:01:23.310> let<00:01:24.299> me

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
actually joined to the domain let me

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.240 
actually joined to the domain let me
show<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.600> this<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:25.040> Windows<00:01:26.040> 7<00:01:26.250> machine<00:01:28.250> once

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
show you this a Windows 7 machine once

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.289 
show you this a Windows 7 machine once
the<00:01:29.369> computer<00:01:29.670> gets<00:01:29.850> joined<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.270> domain

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
the computer gets joined to the domain

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.340 
the computer gets joined to the domain
it'll<00:01:30.960> tell<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.259> its<00:01:31.490> DNS<00:01:32.490> name<00:01:33.110> DC<00:01:34.110> type

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
it'll tell you its DNS name DC type

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.350 
it'll tell you its DNS name DC type
let's<00:01:34.979> go<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.130> operating<00:01:35.549> system<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.180> knows

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
let's go to operating system it knows

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.600 
let's go to operating system it knows
what<00:01:36.600> kind<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.840> operating<00:01:37.200> system<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.710> what

version it is what service pack it is we

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.700 
version it is what service pack it is we
can<00:01:42.180> add<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.720> particular<00:01:43.110> member<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.500> a

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
can add it to a particular member of a

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:53.030 
can add it to a particular member of a
group<00:01:43.860> say

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.660 

now<00:01:54.040> it's<00:01:54.250> a<00:01:54.400> domain<00:01:55.180> controller<00:01:56.520> I'm<00:01:57.520> gonna

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
now it's a domain controller I'm gonna

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:04.070 
now it's a domain controller I'm gonna
remove<00:01:57.970> that<00:01:58.030> that'll<00:01:58.960> cause<00:01:59.110> problems<00:02:02.310> okay

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
remove that that'll cause problems okay

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.660 
remove that that'll cause problems okay
there's<00:02:05.080> a<00:02:05.170> dial<00:02:05.590> in<00:02:05.799> whether<00:02:06.070> this<00:02:06.250> computers

somebody<00:02:38.920> else<00:02:40.590> but<00:02:41.590> I<00:02:41.650> don't<00:02:41.739> know<00:02:42.069> if<00:02:42.190> that's

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
somebody else but I don't know if that's

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.460 
somebody else but I don't know if that's
really<00:02:42.489> safe<00:02:42.819> to<00:02:42.850> do<00:02:43.120> so<00:02:43.299> that's<00:02:44.170> how<00:02:44.319> you<00:02:44.410> add

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
really safe to do so that's how you add

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.670 
really safe to do so that's how you add
a<00:02:44.590> computer<00:02:45.370> to<00:02:45.850> the<00:02:45.880> domain<00:02:46.360> and<00:02:49.680> hopefully

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
a computer to the domain and hopefully

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.449 
a computer to the domain and hopefully
you<00:02:51.100> can<00:02:51.780> do<00:02:52.780> it<00:02:52.930> now<00:02:53.110> but<00:02:53.890> if<00:02:54.130> you<00:02:54.250> want<00:02:54.280> to

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
you can do it now but if you want to

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:55.860 
you can do it now but if you want to
move<00:02:54.579> it<00:02:54.760> you<00:02:54.880> can<00:02:55.000> drag<00:02:55.269> it<00:02:55.299> to<00:02:55.570> a<00:02:55.600> different

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
move it you can drag it to a different

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.810 
move it you can drag it to a different
container<00:02:56.530> in<00:02:56.829> Active<00:02:57.130> Directory<00:02:57.220> users<00:02:57.790> and

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
container in Active Directory users and

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.560 
container in Active Directory users and
computers<00:02:59.700> now<00:03:00.700> it's<00:03:00.910> in<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.150> users

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
computers now it's in the users

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.250 
computers now it's in the users
container<00:03:03.150> but<00:03:04.150> I<00:03:04.209> want<00:03:04.450> to<00:03:04.510> put<00:03:04.630> it<00:03:04.720> back<00:03:04.900> so<00:03:05.200> I

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
container but I want to put it back so I

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.650 
container but I want to put it back so I
grab<00:03:05.620> it<00:03:05.799> and<00:03:05.920> drag<00:03:06.579> it<00:03:06.910> over<00:03:07.030> back<00:03:07.480> to<00:03:07.510> the

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
grab it and drag it over back to the

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.440 
grab it and drag it over back to the
computers<00:03:08.850> and<00:03:09.850> now<00:03:10.750> it's<00:03:10.900> back<00:03:11.079> in<00:03:11.260> computers

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
computers and now it's back in computers

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
computers and now it's back in computers
so<00:03:13.450> hopefully<00:03:13.780> that's<00:03:13.930> taught<00:03:14.140> you<00:03:14.260> about<00:03:14.350> how

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
so hopefully that's taught you about how

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.870 
so hopefully that's taught you about how
to<00:03:14.530> add<00:03:14.680> a<00:03:14.709> computer<00:03:15.010> to<00:03:15.250> Active<00:03:15.760> Directory

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
to add a computer to Active Directory

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.810 
to add a computer to Active Directory
users<00:03:16.239> and<00:03:16.660> computers<00:03:16.840> and<00:03:17.500> you<00:03:18.489> get<00:03:18.640> to<00:03:18.700> play

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
users and computers and you get to play

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.560 
users and computers and you get to play
with<00:03:18.850> it<00:03:19.090> more<00:03:19.209> often<00:03:19.600> now<00:03:19.780> thank<00:03:20.500> you
