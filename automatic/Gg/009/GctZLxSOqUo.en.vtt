kind of drove my wife crazy wiping the
dirt<00:00:56.250> off<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.489> rhe<00:00:56.879> weathering<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.510> but<00:00:57.750> it's

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.979 
dirt off and rhe weathering it but it's
more<00:00:58.770> difficult<00:00:58.829> than<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.520> looks<00:00:59.550> because<00:01:00.539> the

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
more difficult than it looks because the

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.680 
more difficult than it looks because the
old<00:01:01.379> adage<00:01:01.770> says<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:02.640> less<00:01:02.879> is<00:01:02.910> more<00:01:03.359> and

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
old adage says that less is more and

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.200 
old adage says that less is more and
that<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:04.619> definitely<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.159> case<00:01:05.280> when<00:01:06.119> it

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
that is definitely the case when it

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.710 
that is definitely the case when it
comes<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.659> Sand<00:01:07.380> River<00:01:07.530> weathering<00:01:08.010> so<00:01:09.000> ended

stiff<00:01:49.110> bristles<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:50.329> you<00:01:51.329> can<00:01:51.479> really<00:01:51.750> get<00:01:51.899> on

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
stiff bristles and you can really get on

there and do it kind of we'll do a

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.980 
there and do it kind of we'll do a
spread<00:01:55.799> kind<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.280> deal<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.780> don't<00:01:57.780> know<00:01:57.840> if<00:01:57.899> this

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
spread kind of deal I don't know if this

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.420 
spread kind of deal I don't know if this
natural<00:01:58.350> hair<00:01:58.500> or<00:01:58.530> not<00:01:58.799> is<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:59.100> think<00:01:59.280> it's<00:01:59.369> just

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
natural hair or not is I think it's just

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.580 
natural hair or not is I think it's just
a<00:01:59.549> cheapo<00:02:00.000> if<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:00.840> can<00:02:00.930> find<00:02:01.140> one<00:02:01.320> kind<00:02:01.560> of

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
a cheapo if you can find one kind of

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.649 
a cheapo if you can find one kind of
like<00:02:01.710> this<00:02:01.860> or<00:02:02.100> even<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.820> would<00:02:03.299> think<00:02:03.390> like<00:02:03.600> a

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
like this or even I would think like a

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.990 
like this or even I would think like a
makeup<00:02:03.960> brush<00:02:04.229> would<00:02:04.560> probably<00:02:04.860> work<00:02:04.979> this<00:02:05.790> is

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
you end up with that when you do that is

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.560 
you end up with that when you do that is
something<00:02:24.380> that<00:02:24.560> looks<00:02:24.970> sort<00:02:25.970> of<00:02:26.090> painted<00:02:26.450> on

something that looks sort of painted on

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.949 
something that looks sort of painted on
and<00:02:27.340> I<00:02:28.340> had<00:02:29.060> a<00:02:29.090> hard<00:02:29.360> time<00:02:29.510> coming<00:02:29.720> to<00:02:29.870> grips

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
and I had a hard time coming to grips

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.140 
and I had a hard time coming to grips
with<00:02:30.260> with<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.100> fact<00:02:31.310> that<00:02:31.400> it<00:02:31.580> was<00:02:31.820> looking

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
with with the fact that it was looking

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.949 
with with the fact that it was looking
less<00:02:32.420> natural<00:02:32.990> and<00:02:33.170> more<00:02:33.350> painted<00:02:34.150> so<00:02:35.150> I<00:02:35.600> kind

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
less natural and more painted so I kind

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.190 
less natural and more painted so I kind

paper towel something that has a bit of

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.000 
paper towel something that has a bit of
pattern<00:02:42.620> to<00:02:42.800> it<00:02:44.560> doesn't<00:02:45.560> really<00:02:45.650> matter<00:02:45.860> what

pattern to it doesn't really matter what

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.260 
pattern to it doesn't really matter what
the<00:02:46.160> pattern<00:02:46.430> is<00:02:46.520> it's<00:02:46.790> not<00:02:46.910> really<00:02:47.090> going<00:02:47.180> to

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
the pattern is it's not really going to

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.270 
the pattern is it's not really going to
show<00:02:47.420> but<00:02:48.080> you<00:02:48.230> wet<00:02:48.470> it<00:02:48.500> after<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.070> paint

and I ended up going with kind of a
theme<00:03:30.650> here<00:03:31.269> because<00:03:32.269> I<00:03:32.480> felt<00:03:32.690> like<00:03:32.840> it<00:03:32.989> helped

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
theme here because I felt like it helped

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.660 
theme here because I felt like it helped
define<00:03:34.519> the<00:03:34.580> character<00:03:35.120> somewhat<00:03:35.570> so<00:03:36.670> there's

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
define the character somewhat so there's

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.979 
define the character somewhat so there's
kind<00:03:37.910> of<00:03:38.000> a<00:03:38.150> scar<00:03:39.110> of<00:03:39.560> I<00:03:40.130> don't<00:03:41.120> know<00:03:41.239> like<00:03:41.930> a

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
blast mark or something that kind of

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.900 
blast mark or something that kind of
goes<00:03:43.700> down<00:03:43.910> to<00:03:44.090> face<00:03:44.299> and<00:03:45.190> I<00:03:46.190> kept<00:03:46.580> trying<00:03:46.880> to

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
goes down to face and I kept trying to

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.120 
goes down to face and I kept trying to
keep<00:03:47.060> it<00:03:47.239> darkest<00:03:47.750> and<00:03:47.989> the<00:03:48.140> recessed<00:03:48.680> areas

keep it darkest and the recessed areas

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.090 
keep it darkest and the recessed areas
that's<00:03:49.370> another<00:03:49.670> key<00:03:50.150> you<00:03:51.110> notice<00:03:51.410> that<00:03:51.620> in

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
that's another key you notice that in

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.890 
that's another key you notice that in
places<00:03:52.640> where<00:03:52.850> the<00:03:53.540> helmet<00:03:54.140> is<00:03:54.579> protruding<00:03:55.579> or

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
places where the helmet is protruding or

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.350 
places where the helmet is protruding or
really<00:03:56.900> slick<00:03:57.260> there<00:03:57.590> it's<00:03:58.280> pretty<00:03:58.489> clean<00:03:58.820> and

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
really slick there it's pretty clean and

really slick there it's pretty clean and
then<00:03:59.540> when<00:03:59.690> you<00:03:59.810> get<00:03:59.930> up<00:04:00.110> in<00:04:00.260> these<00:04:00.380> crevices

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
then when you get up in these crevices
