remotes<00:00:31.170> I<00:00:31.349> think<00:00:31.529> if<00:00:31.650> you're<00:00:31.769> not<00:00:31.859> using<00:00:32.189> them

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
remotes I think if you're not using them

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.970 
remotes I think if you're not using them
you<00:00:32.489> should<00:00:32.640> be<00:00:33.200> and<00:00:34.200> hopefully<00:00:34.559> this<00:00:34.829> video

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
will convince you as to why if you are

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.290 
will convince you as to why if you are
finding<00:00:37.590> yourself<00:00:38.250> being<00:00:38.489> redlined<00:00:39.000> or<00:00:39.210> if

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
finding yourself being redlined or if

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.270 
finding yourself being redlined or if
you'll<00:00:39.420> find<00:00:39.660> yourself<00:00:39.840> being<00:00:40.260> proto<00:00:40.649> stomped

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
you'll find yourself being proto stomped

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.850

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
that I generally tend to do it doesn't

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.240 
that I generally tend to do it doesn't
always<00:00:45.809> work<00:00:46.079> you're<00:00:46.469> not<00:00:46.590> going<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.800> get<00:00:46.920> know

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
always work you're not going to get know

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.270 
always work you're not going to get know
if<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.460> if<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.730> are<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.940> KD<00:00:48.360> person<00:00:49.260> as<00:00:49.440> in<00:00:50.129> your

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
if you if you are a KD person as in your

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.549 
if you if you are a KD person as in your
KD<00:00:50.489> matters<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.270> then<00:00:51.480> firstly<00:00:51.870> don't<00:00:52.350> be

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
KD matters to you then firstly don't be

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.560 
KD matters to you then firstly don't be
and<00:00:52.800> secondly<00:00:53.579> well<00:00:54.030> this<00:00:54.210> probably<00:00:54.360> isn't

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
and secondly well this probably isn't

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.720 
and secondly well this probably isn't
for<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.840> but<00:00:55.170> because<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.160> die<00:00:56.340> pretty<00:00:56.640> much

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
for you but because you die pretty much

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.220 
for you but because you die pretty much
every<00:00:57.030> time<00:00:57.210> but<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.539> point<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:58.050> get<00:00:58.199> a

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
every time but the point is you get a

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.369 
every time but the point is you get a
got<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:58.980> blueprint<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.820> dragonfly<00:01:00.570> suit<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:01.109> have

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
got a blueprint a dragonfly suit I have

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.039 
got a blueprint a dragonfly suit I have
one<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:02.370> think<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:02.879> as<00:01:03.149> she<00:01:03.270> got<00:01:03.420> four<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:03.899> them

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
one I think of as she got four of them

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.200 
one I think of as she got four of them
no<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.320> think<00:01:04.530> about<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.830> anyway<00:01:05.159> take<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.640> dragon

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
no I think about it anyway take a dragon

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.600 
no I think about it anyway take a dragon
flight<00:01:06.510> or<00:01:07.260> even<00:01:07.590> just<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.890> scout<00:01:08.130> suit<00:01:08.400> that's

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
flight or even just a scout suit that's

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.390 
flight or even just a scout suit that's
cheap<00:01:08.880> or<00:01:09.150> even<00:01:09.390> free<00:01:09.750> if<00:01:09.930> you've<00:01:10.049> got<00:01:10.229> one<00:01:10.439> you

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
cheap or even free if you've got one you

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.450 
cheap or even free if you've got one you
fit<00:01:11.640> an<00:01:11.790> SMG<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.750> then<00:01:13.350> fit<00:01:13.619> kinetic

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
fit an SMG to it and then fit kinetic

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.630 
fit an SMG to it and then fit kinetic
catalyzers<00:01:15.180> militia<00:01:15.659> is<00:01:15.930> just<00:01:16.200> fine<00:01:16.490> and<00:01:17.490> then

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
catalyzers militia is just fine and then

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.330 
catalyzers militia is just fine and then
fit<00:01:18.000> some<00:01:18.360> remote<00:01:18.750> explosives<00:01:19.409> not<00:01:19.830> necessary

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
fit some remote explosives not necessary

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.249 
fit some remote explosives not necessary
good<00:01:20.549> ones<00:01:20.759> just<00:01:21.060> fit<00:01:21.299> maybe<00:01:21.509> advanced<00:01:22.080> ones

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
good ones just fit maybe advanced ones

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.190 
good ones just fit maybe advanced ones
and<00:01:22.580> you're<00:01:23.580> pretty<00:01:23.939> much<00:01:24.180> mission<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.990> run

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
and you're pretty much mission is to run

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.109 
and you're pretty much mission is to run
in<00:01:25.380> don't<00:01:25.650> bother<00:01:25.860> with<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.189> gun<00:01:26.369> just<00:01:26.670> run<00:01:26.909> in

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
in don't bother with the gun just run in

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.630 
in don't bother with the gun just run in
drop<00:01:27.990> your<00:01:28.229> load<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.740> then<00:01:29.009> run<00:01:29.220> like<00:01:29.400> hell

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
drop your load and then run like hell

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.069 
drop your load and then run like hell
and<00:01:29.670> you're<00:01:29.939> basically<00:01:30.299> you're<00:01:30.420> doing<00:01:30.600> this<00:01:30.780> I

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
and you're basically you're doing this I

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.060 
and you're basically you're doing this I
drop<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.470> their<00:01:31.770> run<00:01:32.310> away<00:01:32.520> boom<00:01:32.880> dead<00:01:34.070> now

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
drop that their run away boom dead now

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.609 
drop that their run away boom dead now
this<00:01:35.549> thing<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:36.060> particularly<00:01:36.869> potent

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
this thing is particularly potent

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.499 
this thing is particularly potent
against<00:01:38.070> this<00:01:38.460> kind<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.820> scenario<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.450> you

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
against this kind of scenario so you

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.749 
against this kind of scenario so you
sneak<00:01:39.869> behind<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.380> group<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.590> people<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.220> then

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
sneak behind a group of people and then

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.429 
sneak behind a group of people and then
you<00:01:41.909> drop<00:01:42.420> remotes<00:01:42.750> now<00:01:42.930> generally<00:01:43.320> most

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
you drop remotes now generally most

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.840 
you drop remotes now generally most
people<00:01:43.710> won't<00:01:43.799> see<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.130> remote<00:01:44.369> coming<00:01:44.640> down

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
people won't see the remote coming down

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.490 
people won't see the remote coming down
at<00:01:45.060> this<00:01:45.180> guy<00:01:45.360> didn't<00:01:45.600> even<00:01:45.720> see<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.049> copies

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
at this guy didn't even see it copies

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.020 
at this guy didn't even see it copies
buddy<00:01:46.740> dying<00:01:47.040> so<00:01:47.220> who<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.520> know<00:01:47.610> sucks<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.000> be

doing with this whole tactic is is

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.499 
doing with this whole tactic is is
sneaky<00:01:52.799> sneak<00:01:53.040> finding<00:01:53.790> them<00:01:53.970> dropping<00:01:54.450> a

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
sneaky sneak finding them dropping a

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.330 
sneaky sneak finding them dropping a
remote<00:01:54.780> behind<00:01:55.110> them<00:01:55.320> leaving<00:01:55.890> them<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.189> little

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
remote behind them leaving them a little

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.859 
remote behind them leaving them a little
present<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.149> way<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.270> like<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.450> think<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.780> it

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
present is the way I like to think of it

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.840 
present is the way I like to think of it
and<00:01:58.079> then<00:01:58.259> you<00:01:58.799> know<00:01:58.890> basically<00:01:59.250> just<00:01:59.460> drop<00:01:59.700> in

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
and then you know basically just drop in

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.300 
and then you know basically just drop in
the<00:01:59.939> bomb<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.329> you<00:02:00.479> can<00:02:01.259> generally<00:02:01.950> avoid

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
the bomb and you can generally avoid

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.249 
the bomb and you can generally avoid
damage<00:02:02.939> quite<00:02:03.210> nicely<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.780> people<00:02:04.020> have<00:02:04.140> been

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
damage quite nicely and people have been

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.600 
damage quite nicely and people have been
kind<00:02:04.469> of<00:02:04.530> flaming<00:02:04.950> me<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.070> little<00:02:05.219> bit<00:02:05.399> for

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
kind of flaming me a little bit for

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.210 
kind of flaming me a little bit for
talking<00:02:06.149> about<00:02:06.329> this<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:07.259> know<00:02:07.290> WASD

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
talking about this you know WASD

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.450 
talking about this you know WASD
strafing

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
strafing

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.840 
strafing
too<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:10.980> that's<00:02:11.980> usually<00:02:12.190> evidence<00:02:12.670> that

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
too and that's usually evidence that

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.310 
too and that's usually evidence that
they<00:02:13.030> are<00:02:13.300> a<00:02:13.330> bit<00:02:13.540> worried<00:02:13.840> that<00:02:13.960> it<00:02:14.050> might<00:02:14.140> get

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
they are a bit worried that it might get

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.080 
they are a bit worried that it might get
nerfed<00:02:14.620> it<00:02:14.920> is<00:02:15.040> something<00:02:15.430> because<00:02:15.910> like

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
nerfed it is something because like

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.460 
nerfed it is something because like
obviously<00:02:16.360> with<00:02:16.480> a<00:02:16.510> scout<00:02:16.870> you're<00:02:17.080> doing<00:02:17.380> this

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
obviously with a scout you're doing this

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.930 
obviously with a scout you're doing this
pretty<00:02:17.740> much<00:02:17.920> yeah<00:02:18.130> this<00:02:18.280> is<00:02:18.400> how<00:02:18.520> your<00:02:18.670> speed

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
pretty much yeah this is how your speed

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.270 
pretty much yeah this is how your speed
tanking<00:02:19.390> pretty<00:02:19.630> much<00:02:19.870> doesn't<00:02:20.770> work<00:02:20.980> all<00:02:21.190> the

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
tanking pretty much doesn't work all the

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.880 
tanking pretty much doesn't work all the
time<00:02:21.310> but<00:02:21.700> quite<00:02:22.450> quite<00:02:22.960> honestly<00:02:23.380> just

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
time but quite quite honestly just

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.560 
time but quite quite honestly just
jigging<00:02:24.370> back<00:02:24.550> and<00:02:24.790> forward<00:02:25.090> with<00:02:25.240> the<00:02:25.330> scout

now check this next one out this was

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.670 
now check this next one out this was
probably<00:02:36.700> just<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.270> the<00:02:37.660> PS<00:02:38.140> there<00:02:38.380> is<00:02:38.500> east

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
probably just the the PS there is east

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.010 
probably just the the PS there is east
on<00:02:38.890> so<00:02:39.160> basically<00:02:39.520> run<00:02:39.700> in<00:02:39.910> we<00:02:40.240> drop<00:02:40.570> one<00:02:40.780> there

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020

we drop the other one between the tip of
three<00:02:42.850> there<00:02:43.060> and<00:02:43.300> then<00:02:43.480> basically<00:02:43.800> bye-bye

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
i think that's it it's good because what

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.010 
i think that's it it's good because what
you<00:02:51.340> find<00:02:51.580> is<00:02:51.820> most<00:02:52.090> people<00:02:52.420> will<00:02:52.540> switch<00:02:52.810> two

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
you find is most people will switch two

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.480 
you find is most people will switch two
heavies<00:02:53.320> when<00:02:53.590> they're<00:02:53.740> looking<00:02:53.860> to<00:02:54.100> do<00:02:54.220> maps

heavies when they're looking to do maps

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.180 
heavies when they're looking to do maps

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
like this where it's very combined and

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.280 
like this where it's very combined and
explosives<00:02:57.970> are<00:02:58.180> just<00:02:58.390> deadly<00:02:58.660> when<00:02:59.140> you've

haven't seen me kablooey and sit and

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.220 
haven't seen me kablooey and sit and
this<00:03:15.190> isn't<00:03:15.490> only<00:03:15.670> the<00:03:15.820> f<00:03:16.030> 45s<00:03:16.810> even<00:03:17.050> if<00:03:17.140> you

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
this isn't only the f 45s even if you

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.130 
this isn't only the f 45s even if you
ran<00:03:17.410> the<00:03:17.590> normal<00:03:17.950> remotes<00:03:18.840> just<00:03:19.840> literally

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
ran the normal remotes just literally

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.380 
ran the normal remotes just literally
called<00:03:20.320> remote<00:03:20.530> explosives<00:03:21.220> they're<00:03:21.910> just<00:03:22.240> as

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
called remote explosives they're just as

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.020 
called remote explosives they're just as
good<00:03:22.630> pretty<00:03:23.020> much<00:03:23.320> so<00:03:23.650> i<00:03:23.860> think<00:03:24.310> give<00:03:24.640> it<00:03:24.730> a<00:03:24.790> go

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
good pretty much so i think give it a go

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.300 
good pretty much so i think give it a go
i<00:03:25.300> think<00:03:25.690> a<00:03:25.780> lot<00:03:25.810> of<00:03:26.050> the<00:03:26.200> time<00:03:26.560> in<00:03:26.800> dust<00:03:27.040> it

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
i think a lot of the time in dust it

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.280 
i think a lot of the time in dust it
really<00:03:27.670> is<00:03:27.760> about<00:03:27.970> rock<00:03:28.270> paper<00:03:28.540> scissors<00:03:29.080> and

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
really is about rock paper scissors and

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.020 
really is about rock paper scissors and
i<00:03:29.350> think<00:03:29.590> sometimes<00:03:29.860> you<00:03:30.400> just<00:03:30.580> have<00:03:30.700> to<00:03:30.820> come

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
i think sometimes you just have to come

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.540 
i think sometimes you just have to come
up<00:03:31.120> with<00:03:31.180> a<00:03:31.480> tactic<00:03:32.440> or<00:03:32.560> a<00:03:32.650> fit<00:03:33.010> that<00:03:33.340> really

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
up with a tactic or a fit that really

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.060 
up with a tactic or a fit that really
just<00:03:33.790> gives<00:03:34.030> you<00:03:34.440> firstly<00:03:35.440> a<00:03:35.500> bit<00:03:35.800> of<00:03:35.920> fun

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
just gives you firstly a bit of fun

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.160 
just gives you firstly a bit of fun
because<00:03:36.550> this<00:03:36.730> map<00:03:36.970> is<00:03:37.000> all<00:03:37.300> for<00:03:37.570> when<00:03:37.750> people

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
because this map is all for when people

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.050 
because this map is all for when people
start<00:03:38.440> you<00:03:38.620> know<00:03:38.740> clogging<00:03:39.400> up<00:03:39.550> the<00:03:39.580> the

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
start you know clogging up the the

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.550 
start you know clogging up the the
corridors<00:03:40.540> with<00:03:40.690> heavies<00:03:40.990> like<00:03:41.200> human

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
corridors with heavies like human

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.920 
corridors with heavies like human
archery<00:03:41.980> human<00:03:42.970> cholesterol<00:03:43.420> and<00:03:43.510> i<00:03:43.600> think<00:03:43.810> to

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
archery human cholesterol and i think to

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.360 
archery human cholesterol and i think to
be<00:03:44.020> honest<00:03:44.230> what<00:03:44.380> you<00:03:44.500> want<00:03:44.650> to<00:03:44.740> do<00:03:44.950> is<00:03:45.190> have

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
be honest what you want to do is have

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.010 
be honest what you want to do is have
the<00:03:45.550> ability<00:03:45.850> to<00:03:45.880> clear<00:03:46.240> them<00:03:46.420> out<00:03:46.540> and<00:03:46.780> so

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
the ability to clear them out and so

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.470 
the ability to clear them out and so
remote<00:03:47.380> explosives<00:03:47.950> in<00:03:48.160> conclusion<00:03:49.030> are

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
remote explosives in conclusion are

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.810 
remote explosives in conclusion are
probably<00:03:49.930> one<00:03:50.110> of<00:03:50.140> the<00:03:50.260> finer<00:03:50.590> ways<00:03:50.890> to<00:03:51.670> do

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
probably one of the finer ways to do

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.690 
probably one of the finer ways to do
that<00:03:52.030> to<00:03:52.990> be<00:03:53.020> honest<00:03:53.410> it's<00:03:53.650> so<00:03:54.010> cheap<00:03:54.340> it's

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
that to be honest it's so cheap it's

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.760 
that to be honest it's so cheap it's
really<00:03:55.030> really<00:03:55.450> they're<00:03:55.630> cheap<00:03:55.900> when<00:03:56.620> you're

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770 
really really they're cheap when you're

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.770 
really really they're cheap when you're
killing<00:03:57.190> like<00:03:57.520> three<00:03:57.910> or<00:03:58.000> four<00:03:58.030> prototype

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780
