but people smoke on their side and
they're<00:04:03.210> more<00:04:03.360> watched<00:04:03.690> from<00:04:03.930> their<00:04:04.140> kiss<00:04:04.380> and

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
they're more watched from their kiss and

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.470 
they're more watched from their kiss and
on<00:04:05.190> my<00:04:05.280> dad<00:04:05.460> side<00:04:05.670> they<00:04:05.850> have<00:04:05.880> a<00:04:06.000> larger<00:04:06.360> family

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
on my dad side they have a larger family

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.210 
on my dad side they have a larger family
so<00:04:06.750> that<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:07.170> odds<00:04:07.320> of<00:04:07.530> somebody<00:04:07.890> smoking

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
so that the odds of somebody smoking

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.850 
so that the odds of somebody smoking
would<00:04:08.490> be<00:04:08.610> more<00:04:08.910> but<00:04:09.900> they<00:04:10.500> don't<00:04:10.650> have<00:04:10.680> any

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
would be more but they don't have any

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.650 
would be more but they don't have any
business<00:04:11.010> phone<00:04:11.280> so<00:04:11.850> I<00:04:12.150> don't<00:04:12.390> really<00:04:12.420> think

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
business phone so I don't really think

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:13.610 
business phone so I don't really think
there's<00:04:12.780> much<00:04:12.930> luck<00:04:13.140> or<00:04:13.290> deliciousness

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
there's much luck or deliciousness

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.560
