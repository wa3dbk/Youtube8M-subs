00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:06.640
 hello I am oscar an expert of smart and in 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.340
 this opportunity is with my friend 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.960
 Mauricio Paniagua Samsung Trainer at 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:15.010
 this time we will be talking about the 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.750
 new samsung galaxy s 68 and flat oricio 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.179
 tell us what is a new one that brings the 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.550
 samsung galaxy s 6 excellent oscar then 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:23.679
 well i tell you the galaxy s 6 has two 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.269
 different models the first is the is 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:26.949
 truth that we have here that what 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:29.109
 it means it has the screens 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.669
 curves on the sides and the flat so that 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.920
 phone a little more traditional than 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:37.090
 has the screen completely straight and 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.590
 what is the difference of s 6 when 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.510
 we talk about the 16th we are talking about the 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.210
 two since I understand that they are differences 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.800
 between the two phones with the 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.769
 difference between the operation of the 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.750
 16 and the perfect s5 good I'll tell you 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:52.629
 look then in the case of the galaxy s 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.100
 6 and in that the type is the one that has the 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:55.600
 curved screens allows you some 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.969
 smart tools like by 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.649
 example on this side you can get 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.089
 some frequent contacts in 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.070
 particular are five contacts 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:04.930
 frequent and for each of them you 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.090
 choose a color to then whenever 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.960
 you call one of the contacts 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.340
 frequent 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.409
 allow you to see a 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.030
 colored marquee and thus identify 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:14.740
 easily who he is and what is 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.930
 calling because the other tool 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.970
 smart you have is when you have 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.890
 blocked the phone is not that it has 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.020
 shielded to one of the sides and gives you 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.119
 an information marquee this brand 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.890
 is an information allows you to see from 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.320
 Quick way all notifications 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.880
 that you have received whatsapp facebook 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.460
 twitter missed calls with new 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.590
 electronic here and finally mauricio 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.750
 what is the difference between the others 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.369
 telephones since we 're talking about a 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.929
 same phone divided in two 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.539
 which practically it is the 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:45.759
 difference between going well as you 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:47.410
 it said in the case of the two galaxy s 6 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.570
 the models would practically only be 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.460
 the functions of the screen the use of 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.539
 the side curved screens there 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.429
 we would have the same 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.110
 auttacor processor we would have both 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:58.600
 similar cameras of the front camera 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.300
 5 megapixel camera and main camera 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.100
 16 megapixels 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.140
 the significant difference because it would be 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.450
 nothing else your considerations so that what 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.830
 see our friends the phone this is 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.520
 the galaxy 16 flash 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.240
 16 galaxy s 68 are practically the 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.620
 Same size 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.590
 the only thing that changes as it said mauricio 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.790
 is the edges of the screen but I think 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.410
 that we are all curious to know 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.850
 that bring the boxes and 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.920
 characteristics of the model we are going to 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.390
 know them we will know that they have 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.490
 the boxes as I mentioned 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.200
 our friend mauricio the phones are 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.540
 exactly the same ones work from the 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.220
 same way you only have a couple of 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.770
 small differences in the case of 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.900
 operation on the battery is the only 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.070
 difference between the two apart from the 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.980
 physical forms 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.950
 let's open the kit to see contain 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.190
 the boxes we are going to see the flat 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.739
 we found the model samsung galaxy 16 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.720
 the screen is 5.1 inches we have 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.940
 the usb 2.0 entry 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.040
 the headphone input we have for 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.220
 this side the lock button and for this 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.280
 side the volume buttons we're going to 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:04.930
 open here we have the pin quoted that 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.930
 it helps us to remove the sim card 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.550
 we also have the adapter 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.650
 current 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:16.739
 we have the usb 2.0 cable 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:20.090
 and we have the headphones that come with 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:25.310
 the one that we are now going to open 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:27.260
 the samsung galaxy s 6 kit and we are going to 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.310
 check open the box here and 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.709
 we find 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.560
 the model with a screen also of 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:37.260
 5.1 inches down here we find 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.140
 the horn and there is the USB 2.0 input 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.780
 3.5 standard headphone input 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.150
 the button lock the buttons 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.560
 volume and of course your cameras that 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.110
 in a moment we are going to enter a little 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.840
 to detail 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.120
 let's know the kit to check 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.050
 which is the same here we have the cable 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.050
 usb 2.0 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.150
 we also have the adapter 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.150
 current 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:06.330
 the headphones 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.900
 and also the purpose to get the card 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.900
 sim 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.110
 as mentioned by our friend 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.180
 Mauritius the phone works from the 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.540
 same way the difference is in 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:21.290
 battery the galaxy s 6 is has a 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.870
 2600 milliamp battery that this one and 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.870
 we have the galaxy s 6 flat that the 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.330
 battery is 2 thousand 550 milliamperes is 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.590
 a minimal difference otherwise the 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.960
 phones have the same 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.360
 features the 5.1 screen 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.930
 inches both come with gorilla 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:41.360
 glass 4 the internal memory is 22 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:44.720
 gigabyte for the user a 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:49.400
 microprocessor or cta with 2.1 gigahertz 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:51.890
 and a ram of 3 gigabytes we're going to 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.890
 check the operating system version 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:58.490
 we are going to about the device and 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:59.480
 we found the version of android 5.0 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.300
 Point 2 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.860
 lollipop by pressing several times on 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.080
 the version we found this little 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.320
 animation that always comes with the 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.320
 versions 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:19.760
 the camera 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:23.030
 back is 16 megapixels and the camera 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.590
 front is 5 megapixels like what 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:28.430
 mentioned our Mauritian video in a 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:30.470
 principle the galaxy s 6 elche has a 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.660
 a little more screen to the sides 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.400
 which is strange to see in the new 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.010
 phones and samsung decides to venture 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.320
 in this way we will know for what 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:41.300
 they serve these hours on the screen 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:44.229
 let's see how the marquee works 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.160
 that samsung offers us in the new 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:48.380
 samsung galaxy 16 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.740
 we go into configurations and then a 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:53.150
 device we select screen is the 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.970
 lighting and people 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.950
 must be activated we select the 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.849
 type of notifications we want 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.159
 be receiving 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:04.800
 we go down to where it says flow 

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:07.580
 of information here we see how the 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.929
 information is going to be showing 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.240
 we give a touch in administration of 

00:06:09.929 --> 00:06:13.770
 panels and here we find the 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.209
 different panels that we can be 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.909
 watching let's give a tap on the 

00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:19.679
 first and here we have a list of 

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:21.689
 applications that we can activate or 

00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:24.729
 deactivate to show us the 

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:27.009
 notification in the marquee 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:29.860
 once activated 

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:32.009
 as we can see already disabled we are going to 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:34.689
 leave we're going to block the phone 

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:37.740
 we slide on the right side and we can 

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:39.849
 see how the notification appears 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.800
 we can give it up to give it towards 

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:44.080
 below and there we can see how it 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.610
 transports the information let's see 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.740
 also a new feature for what 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:49.149
 that the marquee helps us a bit 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.339
 let's play and we're going to do it 

00:06:49.149 --> 00:06:54.249
 the right we have as the screen is 

00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:56.129
 blurs and five circles appear there 

00:06:54.249 --> 00:06:58.599
 we can add five contacts 

00:06:56.129 --> 00:07:00.189
 preferred to mark them directly 

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:03.240
 at this moment I do not have saved 

00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:06.750
 no contact but we can add it 

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:09.210
 if it does not disappear search and select 

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:11.610
 we look for the name of the contact if 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:14.759
 we had added and they would disappear 

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:16.620
 obviously to be able to configure this I 

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:18.539
 first I have to add the contact in 

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.830
 my contact list is worth the 

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:22.020
 redundancy 

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:23.790
 remember that you can find this or more 

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:26.340
 information of our social networks 

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:28.530
