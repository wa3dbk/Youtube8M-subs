electronic control unit you have to

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.810 
electronic control unit you have to
disconnect<00:03:25.090> the<00:03:25.350> transmission<00:03:26.519> but<00:03:27.519> that'll

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
disconnect the transmission but that'll

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.150 
disconnect the transmission but that'll
take<00:03:28.000> you<00:03:28.120> about<00:03:28.269> eight<00:03:28.480> hours<00:03:28.630> to<00:03:28.810> do<00:03:29.109> I'm<00:03:29.950> on

thirty four hours on this engine right

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.900 
thirty four hours on this engine right
now<00:03:32.230> thirty<00:03:32.799> four<00:03:33.519> hours<00:03:35.190> it's<00:03:36.190> incredibly

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
now thirty four hours it's incredibly

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.270 
now thirty four hours it's incredibly
complicated<00:03:37.680> anyway<00:03:38.680> I<00:03:38.709> wanted<00:03:38.920> to<00:03:39.010> share<00:03:39.160> the

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
number four bolt on top of my exhaust

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.720 
number four bolt on top of my exhaust
manifold<00:03:49.840> it's<00:03:50.200> stuck<00:03:50.620> it's<00:03:51.130> going<00:03:51.400> to<00:03:51.459> break

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
manifold it's stuck it's going to break

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.970 
manifold it's stuck it's going to break
so<00:03:52.510> I'm<00:03:52.600> going<00:03:52.750> to<00:03:52.810> try<00:03:52.959> the<00:03:53.019> same<00:03:53.140> system<00:03:53.830> with

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
so I'm going to try the same system with

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:54.710 
so I'm going to try the same system with
that<00:03:54.099> bolt

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
that bolt

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.759 
that bolt
I've<00:03:55.720> already<00:03:55.989> drilled<00:03:56.170> a<00:03:56.260> hole<00:03:56.290> in<00:03:56.590> it<00:03:56.680> I

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
I've already drilled a hole in it I

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.520 
I've already drilled a hole in it I
filled<00:03:57.040> it<00:03:57.129> up<00:03:57.190> with<00:03:57.250> the

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
filled it up with the

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.209 
filled it up with the
PB<00:03:59.530> spray<00:03:59.920> so<00:04:00.760> that's<00:04:00.969> it<00:04:01.209> a<00:04:02.219> incredibly

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:03.219 
PB spray so that's it a incredibly

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:07.110 
PB spray so that's it a incredibly
difficult<00:04:04.030> job<00:04:04.569> and<00:04:05.489> by<00:04:06.489> the<00:04:06.549> way<00:04:06.730> too<00:04:06.790> as<00:04:07.090> soon

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
difficult job and by the way too as soon

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.009 
difficult job and by the way too as soon
as<00:04:07.359> I<00:04:07.420> broke<00:04:07.659> this<00:04:07.810> bolt<00:04:08.079> loose<00:04:08.670> that<00:04:09.670> pj<00:04:10.659> fluid

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
as I broke this bolt loose that pj fluid

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:12.420 
as I broke this bolt loose that pj fluid
just<00:04:11.109> kept<00:04:11.349> flooding<00:04:11.709> out<00:04:11.799> of<00:04:11.950> here<00:04:12.099> so<00:04:12.280> that's

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
just kept flooding out of here so that's

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.740 
just kept flooding out of here so that's
the<00:04:12.579> stuff<00:04:12.790> that<00:04:12.819> saved<00:04:13.180> me<00:04:13.269> from<00:04:13.359> breaking

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
the stuff that saved me from breaking

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.870 
the stuff that saved me from breaking
