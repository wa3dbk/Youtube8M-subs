question<00:00:07.410> what<00:00:08.069> does<00:00:08.220> mathematics<00:00:08.519> say<00:00:09.269> about

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
question what does mathematics say about

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.110 
question what does mathematics say about
these<00:00:09.690> designs<00:00:10.580> first<00:00:11.580> we<00:00:11.849> need<00:00:12.000> to

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
these designs first we need to

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.049 
these designs first we need to
understand<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.840> five<00:00:13.049> platonic<00:00:13.320> solids<00:00:14.160> the

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
understand the five platonic solids the
