00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.539
 the family bag was samba to start 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.119
 another great show 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.650
 today the gaucho is a bit different and 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.130
 who will have here on the bench not only a 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.529

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.820
 football base and this semester will 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.890
 professional debut by us will 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.750
 know a little more about understanding the 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.100
 expectations and present to the 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.690
 home guys there 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.809
 the first of them is an old acquaintance already 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.760
 The staff always with us but 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:52.230
 always twisting always supporting arrive 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:53.879
 It's already hard to home is named age and 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.449
 playing position and when I have to 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:00.270
 To be with us, I like it here. 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.120
 in Vienna for the attack 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:09.150
 there's always been a third time always 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:11.939
 motivates team that's it goin closed with 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.810
 goal is coming to help the athletic 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.950
 ib 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:20.630
 heavy work the latter with the 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.630
 People come here with Robinho. 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.360
 the house folks who do not know you there 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.439
 nothing is better known as robot play 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.560
 by the tips 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:36.270
 more offensive samba that's it 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.860
 another who is also with us too 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:43.920
 a little known the staff arrives adrio 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.840
 Closed if you learn the staff from home 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.030
 that I know you because that is how much 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.100
 one more value is not pedro lima more 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.460
 known as a rodriguinho to play a 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.100
 a little behind the line 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:57.580
 try to help samba have tried to attack 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.369
 when by the right edges and the 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.500
 our fourth interviewer today 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.509
 I think it's a face that dispenses. 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.869
 comments by the presentations he already 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.399
 was our last interviewee of the show and 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.350
 is the case of success that left borebi 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.520
 left the base where he is picking 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.520
 fruits in the professional 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.660
 I think inter is like I said 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.790
 no show presentations 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.519
 already together with us a long time ago 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.860
 it serves as an inspiration for the 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:28.269
 staff is coming in now and getting a 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.459
 little in an interview ask a little 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:32.860
 luan is how this process of 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.540
 transition from any professional base 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:39.489
 expectation that he will try to impute guilt 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:42.250
 cauÃª and what is expected of this season 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.920
 had blood when he was 9 years old 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.620
 I did a one game workout and oscar like it 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.319
 They told me to keep training and now 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.000
 not happy to play the championship and 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.550
 We are always in search of the title. 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.820
 This is Robinho who wanted me to 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:01.090
 tell us the pressure that can 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.709
 exist is playing on the base have the 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.850
 different pressure from the professional 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.920
 the image is playing a championship 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.930
 that we had a good participation 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.420
 last week we arrived we stayed in 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.799
 second place and sure to be 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.900
 very strong to seek this title and 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:15.190
 I think that because you are young you can come to 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.930
 press more and how do you think 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.299
 that consolidates with that there even 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.940
 need natural but there who is already in the 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:24.190
 cast will help us he's fit in 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.470
 faster and god willing 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.320
 It's all right there last year. 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.950
 we are second but if she is going to give 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.120
 Little talk to us like this. 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.850
 people where you will play this championship 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.489
 with a slightly younger team and thinks 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.260
 which can weigh in relation to the 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.329
 experience may try to use 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.910
 this is a weapon against us because 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:47.560
 we were trying to is to fall on top of 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.380
 young brat let's try to win it will stay 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.450
 in the head on the list of the most do you think 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.530
 field is six to six and does not 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.630
 it will weigh 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.960
 sure at first they will look 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:01.360
 for us a certain different look to 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.520
 Always be younger little 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.840
 better than them but from the moment 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.100
 let's start showing our 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.660
 football in court 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.370
 It will be all right for us and they will. 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.660
 to see that we have quality and 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.000
 strong in pursuit of the title 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.910
 ball show he wanted to be a bit of 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.560
 empire that experienced this already had 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:22.090
 delivery and today I no longer have this pressure 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.580
 can make you a veteran of the 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.080
 home at age 37 the veteran 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.360
 You have to have a kid over there. 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.970
 any word hosted on this 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.280
 time to talk but the kids and have 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.020
 humility but at the same time a lot of 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.640
 boldness has to speak inside the faces 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.140
 all and forever 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.610
 He's going to be all right. 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.440
 this title year 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.240
 That's it, it's ball show bringing more 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.720
 a dog let's do nothing again 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.720
 thanks
