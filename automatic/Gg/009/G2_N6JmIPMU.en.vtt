00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.309
 hello a last princess little person 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.470
 disney because if it's a princess I would 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.389
 you have clarified in the comments I 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.580
 I thought not, but if you disney 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.490
 considered as such so it is true that 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.420
 I've opted for pocahontas and now 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.420
 same let's see it 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.170
 here we have pocahontas because I have 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.900
 decided to put her on it because 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:32.110
 considers that the story of the film 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.850
 I liked it very much and I consider that it has 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.129
 a pretty important message about 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.309
 all the lyrics of the songs and has 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:44.890
 good moral this is a bet of 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:47.770
 clothes a style and this would be another 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.440
 I searched because of course I had to 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.120
 outside to arm that I actually said 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.579
 She considered herself a princess and was 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.290
 looking for information about it and it's 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:58.930
 curious because I do not know if you know but 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.750
 few people existed was a real girl in 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.730
 his story with a real fact but not 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.130
 it was exactly how Disney told it 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.900
 totally different and the truth as 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.270
 I'm looking for information about her 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.830
 Well, I read your whole story, you'll see 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.570
 to look for it for example you put in 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.630
 youtube real story 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.390
 pocahontas is quite curious its 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.940
 real name was killed here and the thing is 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.970
 that the English settlers came to 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.110
 virginia to work in a series of 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.440
 settlements in the area where they lived 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.149
 pocahontas and the tribe of pocahontas 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.520
 kidnapped a settler leader who was not 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.619
 other than john smith and when they were 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.360
 point to kill him because the tribe of 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.840
 pocahontas was going to kill him on a 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.270
 stone to cut the head created few 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.850
 high drops on him saving his life 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.310
 but at that time little board had 12 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.350
 years is to say that he did not have any 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.860
 relationship with john smith visions was not 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.200
 already a man 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.420
 I'm going to leave here a photo of little 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.480
 mount the little real board so you see it 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.850
 that 's pocahontas and this is john smith 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.350
 As you can see, the difference in age is 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.940
 pretty big the things that you 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.440
 they made very friends they did not have any 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.540
 love story the truth is that few 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.220
 together he married one of his tribe and 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.810
 got married a second time with a 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.570
 possible man did not have enough 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.210
 rosso money was there in england had 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:19.810
 a son had a son with that man and 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:22.270
 He died only with 22 years old pocahontas 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.580
 He died very young, it is not very clear 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.730
 who died by some places puts that of 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.350
 some tuberculosis fever and others put 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.000
 of smallpox is not very clear that 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.910
 he died but what is true is 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.130
 who died with 20 22 years in a place 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.410
 puts 20 another 22 more or less on that 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.690
 age died super young the truth that the 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.500
 life of little board is very interesting os 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.180
 I encourage you to search for it by google or the 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.620
 look on youtube also some 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.040
 videos that are very well made of all 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.930
 its history 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.579
 I'm like you'll like the bid 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.939
 truth I did not know I had no idea 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:57.620
 that it was a fact, that is, little 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:59.450
 decision but clear what is in the 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.250
 disney movie instead quite 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.530
 things because as you can see john smith was a 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.840
 very old man and she was a girl of 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.200
 12 years and they did not have any history 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.670
 of love and good then with pocahontas 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.010
 we complete the unit it is already all 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.980
 You have sent me complete 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.870
 the beautiful dress the white dress 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.599
 snow and good we have left a lot 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.340
 of princesses back and I would like to put it 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.379
 so I think I 'm going to make another unit 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.700
 well complete the unit I hope that 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:27.470
 you have liked all the little princess 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.959
 including but extra good is not 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.849
 but it 's my favorite disney character 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.040
 as I said in your video and it's very possible 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:35.900
 make another Disney princess unit 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.299
 so the one that has not been included 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.790
 I would have liked him to put no 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:43.129
 worry because it will be today with the 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.579
