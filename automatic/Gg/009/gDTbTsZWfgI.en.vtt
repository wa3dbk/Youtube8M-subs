forgot to bring socks on this trip with
me<00:03:27.769> and<00:03:28.269> I<00:03:29.269> swear<00:03:29.660> that<00:03:29.690> I'm<00:03:30.140> I've<00:03:30.920> been<00:03:31.160> able

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
me and I swear that I'm I've been able

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.340 
me and I swear that I'm I've been able
to<00:03:31.430> move<00:03:31.610> my<00:03:31.790> toes<00:03:31.850> a<00:03:32.060> little<00:03:32.420> bit<00:03:32.600> more<00:03:32.840> lately

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
to move my toes a little bit more lately

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.039 
to move my toes a little bit more lately
than<00:03:33.739> I<00:03:33.769> usually<00:03:34.190> can<00:03:34.430> and<00:03:35.420> I'm<00:03:35.540> wondering<00:03:35.930> if

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
than I usually can and I'm wondering if

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.949 
than I usually can and I'm wondering if
maybe<00:03:36.080> it's<00:03:36.620> because<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:38.090> socks<00:03:38.630> that<00:03:38.810> I

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
maybe it's because the socks that I

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:40.809 
maybe it's because the socks that I
usually<00:03:39.380> wear<00:03:39.560> constrict<00:03:40.220> the<00:03:40.340> blood<00:03:40.370> flow<00:03:40.790> to

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819

usually wear constrict the blood flow to
my<00:03:41.030> feet<00:03:41.870> or<00:03:42.140> something<00:03:42.530> and<00:03:42.799> that<00:03:42.950> without

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
my feet or something and that without

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.750 
my feet or something and that without
that<00:03:43.580> I<00:03:44.049> can<00:03:45.049> get<00:03:45.200> more<00:03:45.440> blood<00:03:45.709> or<00:03:45.769> more<00:03:46.160> oxygen

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
that I can get more blood or more oxygen

usually<00:07:54.919> takes<00:07:55.159> a<00:07:55.279> little<00:07:55.400> on<00:07:55.550> Walter

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:56.180 
usually takes a little on Walter

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:57.969

because<00:07:56.749> as<00:07:56.930> I<00:07:57.080> mentioned<00:07:57.110> I<00:07:57.589> do<00:07:57.830> this

00:07:57.969 --> 00:07:57.979 
because as I mentioned I do this

00:07:57.979 --> 00:08:01.089 
because as I mentioned I do this
stretching<00:07:58.490> and<00:07:58.789> just<00:07:59.479> kind<00:07:59.659> of<00:07:59.749> relax<00:08:00.080> but<00:08:01.069> I

00:08:01.089 --> 00:08:01.099 
stretching and just kind of relax but I

00:08:01.099 --> 00:08:03.519 
stretching and just kind of relax but I
wanted<00:08:01.430> to<00:08:01.520> get<00:08:01.639> this<00:08:01.960> I<00:08:02.960> didn't<00:08:03.259> want<00:08:03.379> to<00:08:03.439> make

00:08:03.519 --> 00:08:03.529
