00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.069
 and welcome to one 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:10.559
 new to my new overall concept 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.500
 say of any minecraft and 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.210
 though from the bucks in minecraft i 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.170
 be here always the newest box 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.410
 publish 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.750
 I should give these in the versions 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.519
 Let's introduce you here in one 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.710
 another version has been fixed just like that 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.439
 it may be that you the baxi 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.700
 introduce newer versions to other versions 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.829
 still there 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.280
 but it can be, it has been fixed 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.450
 therefore I can not count on it 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.120
 tell that they are in all things 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.670
 Now we are working here 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.170
 are currently in the version 1 6 2 if 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.820
 I have the invisible trip in here 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.940
 multiplayer originally also wanted in 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.300
 show multiplayer but unfortunately I have 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.309
 only one account is also bought 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.949
 gone on cracked looking as it could 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.180
 Unfortunately, I do not place boats 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.899
 take here we must namely boats 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:09.170
 place 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:11.970
 I can just show it okay 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:16.350
 you just have to place it here and 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.630
 while the thing is singing like that 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.560
 just go in 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:26.430
 that should not be so right now 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:29.640
 that happens that happens once 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.659
 quickly get rid of the boat and the same 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.490
 tried again so sat down the boat 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.950
 words it is such a sink then 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:43.259
 Reintermit and f to leave and now 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.700
 very much the boat here and we could 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.590
 am a right-click again the boat clean 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.810
 but you can jump high enough now 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:55.920
 because of your hidden boxes 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:57.659
 and if I'm in the 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.170
 multiplayer would be able to soon enough 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.640
 demonstrate 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.860
 if there are two players sitting here now 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.270
 he would see this here would boot 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.040
 not see 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.630
 and he could not do that either 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.849
 then just go down through that 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.450
 They can not go through things either 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.990
 move 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.520
 Actually, the boat is still here 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.950
 to be able to make a right click 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.640
 that education is coming in but somehow im 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:23.130
 moment just not okay and the good 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.570
 although this is the case with most servers 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.950
 flies issued is that he counts 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:30.120
 not all fly though you are 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.500
 actually a kind of air flies around 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.600
 the thing is to get away 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.460
 only the blocks where the boat is placed 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.010
 was lured away and then you can do that 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:44.850
 but probably destroy it again 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:47.700
 yes hello okay now that's it 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.520
 my first day here on youtube in the 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.530
 version 1 6 2 it may be that the 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.920
 author in your version works that 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:59.430
 would have to try it myself 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:03.590
 well then that was it with this bug and 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.590
 bye until next time
