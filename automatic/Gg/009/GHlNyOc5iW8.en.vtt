00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
he's pretty readable is what he does you

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.020 
he's pretty readable is what he does you
know<00:02:39.209> he's<00:02:39.360> a<00:02:39.390> fairly<00:02:40.220> simple<00:02:41.220> guy<00:02:41.550> he's<00:02:41.820> not

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
know he's a fairly simple guy he's not

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.270 
know he's a fairly simple guy he's not
he's<00:02:42.390> not<00:02:42.600> a<00:02:42.630> Swiss<00:02:43.020> Army<00:02:43.170> knife<00:02:43.350> he's<00:02:43.920> a<00:02:43.950> guy
