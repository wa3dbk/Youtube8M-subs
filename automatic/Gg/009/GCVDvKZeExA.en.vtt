00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.840
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.179
 more weapons guide in which i will give you 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.080
 all four dm's in battlefield line 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.470
 will introduce you 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:20.789
 these become the so from 16 the pcr 91 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.289
 the saiga 308 and the s25 etc 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.820
 I'll show you which one was best 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.560
 in this category represents if you 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.119
 the damage model looks at the dms 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.670
 then one would first believe that the 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.109
 Saiga 308 already from 18 meters against the 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.969
 but the remaining three weapons swing away 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.070
 in the end, this value is perfect 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.750
 to neglect because all four weapons on 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.579
 every distance de facto always three 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.719
 body hits also require the 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.399
 Ammunition can not be distinguished 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.899
 notice because all weapons with one 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.579
 fangschuss pro magazine 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.890
 Likewise, all four have the same 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.750
 same firing rate with 360 shot per 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.550
 minute at molex trade so the ball 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.020
 spreu almost looks the same 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.879
 only in the targeted shoot on the 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.680
 the pta is twice as high 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.219
 spill but still very low 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.350
 fails 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.059
 therefore, the recall speaks that 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.620
 Gasoline while shooting and the evidence 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.690
 time is crucial for this comparison 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.360
 and then here shows that on the side 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.159
 the criminal the ptr 91 the better 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.110
 theme is because they both the 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.070
 highest ball speed with 570 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.960
 meter per second 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.000
 the slightest red cross to the side and 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.540
 However, the shortest reverberation time with 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.159
 23 or 29 seconds depending on whether 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.570
 one shot empty or one more 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.310
 ball in the run has only at 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.320
 forgiven the top is the scarce 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.790
 worst weapon and also the ball 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.290
 analyzed scattering exclude the 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.659
 stand is twice as high as all 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.119
 at de Mars on the part of the police 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.579
 The Saiga 308 is the best weapon in the world 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.070
 highest maximum distance with 2200 liters 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.229
 owns and when reloading a half 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.150
 full magazine also only 23 seconds 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.220
 However , she also has the 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.290
 lowest ball speed with 440 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.729
 meters per second which inevitably 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.619
 also the bulle drop the worst 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.869
 this is important for shooting 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.700
 on a larger distance because you are here so 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.649
 must aim higher than the rest 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.360
 the mars and also one 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.219
 the moving target is the movement 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.840
 should also be considered 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.340
 you avoid the magazine completely 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.300
 empty to close here then the 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.650
 reverberation time of 35 seconds 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.600
 represents the longest of the four weapons 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.630
 Finally, I can tell you so the pta 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.550
 91 as well as the saiga 308 recommend which 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.930
 this second last end the better 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.880
 represents then depends on your own 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.920
 play style or something 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.540
 more important would be on big distances 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.790
 I like the saiga but personally 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.380
 like the pta 91 because of the high ball 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.030
 speed and fast after 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.560
 time clearly better and against the 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.940
 high delay leads to the weapons 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.770
 anyway, no way on the 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.210
 Angled handle passed the the 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.190
 delay of the first shot by one 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.170
 reduced and where it is 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.100
 almost every shot of it affected 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.930
 further recommended is the 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.640
 compensatory tower thereby reducing the value 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.560
 The gallery is additionally reduced 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.150
 unlike Battlefield 4 where 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.800
 just as you can with a maximum of 4 times 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.840
 you could use zoom in 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.370
 hardliner would also be stronger as well 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.020
 Use with the sniper rifles 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.790
 when using because the margin should one 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.950
 Avoid it at all costs 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.840
 Quick to lock as it so to one 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.100
 extreme warp of the weapon comes when 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.870
 once you have a good feeling for that 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.060
 right timing has developed then 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.650
 to distance a fcb player only in the 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.940
 Absolutely it is recommended that the 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.390
 shot button as soon as possible 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.160
 to press 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.750
 since you are in the one-on-one without exception 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.370
 every weapon is inferior and there you are 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.140
 even at extreme distances only 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.060
 Three hits needed one should 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.800
 keep some distance from opponents 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.810
 to take advantage of this advantage perfectly 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.370
 Have fun using the debate and 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.810
 I hope this short weapons guide has 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.370
 you liked and above all helped with 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.510
 the choice of your weapon if so 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.590
 then I would, of course, delighted with 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.970
 to rejoice the body of you 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.459
 otherwise it will do well and until the 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.060
 go well next time and on 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.060
 meet again 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.370
 With 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.230
 a
