test<00:00:11.880> um<00:00:13.370> so<00:00:14.370> i<00:00:14.400> think<00:00:14.519> it<00:00:14.759> looks<00:00:14.940> pretty<00:00:15.030> good

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
test um so i think it looks pretty good

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.200 
test um so i think it looks pretty good
and<00:00:16.039> more<00:00:17.039> importantly<00:00:17.460> sounds<00:00:17.910> pretty<00:00:18.119> good

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
and more importantly sounds pretty good

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.870 
and more importantly sounds pretty good
now<00:00:18.960> i<00:00:18.990> keep<00:00:19.410> it<00:00:19.529> on<00:00:19.619> fast<00:00:19.920> graphics<00:00:20.430> i<00:00:20.640> think

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
now i keep it on fast graphics i think

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.160 
now i keep it on fast graphics i think
it<00:00:20.939> just<00:00:21.090> looks<00:00:21.420> better<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:23.630> don't<00:00:24.630> know<00:00:24.750> that's

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
it just looks better I don't know that's

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.490 
it just looks better I don't know that's
me<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:27.029> guess<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.359> runs<00:00:27.480> them<00:00:27.720> faster<00:00:28.199> I

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
me and I guess it runs them faster I

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.650 
me and I guess it runs them faster I
like<00:00:29.010> smooth<00:00:29.279> waiting<00:00:29.670> on<00:00:29.820> otherwise<00:00:30.390> it

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
like smooth waiting on otherwise it

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.760 
like smooth waiting on otherwise it
looks<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:31.279> lot<00:00:32.279> worse<00:00:32.630> and<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:34.290> still<00:00:34.559> runs

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
looks a lot worse and it still runs

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.369 
looks a lot worse and it still runs
pretty<00:00:34.890> smoothly<00:00:36.140> render<00:00:37.140> assistance<00:00:37.910> far<00:00:38.910> is

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
pretty smoothly render assistance far is

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.840 
pretty smoothly render assistance far is
really<00:00:40.379> not<00:00:40.530> bad<00:00:41.329> but<00:00:42.590> normal<00:00:43.590> is<00:00:43.829> much<00:00:44.550> better

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
really not bad but normal is much better

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:54.920 
really not bad but normal is much better
so<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.920> tend<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.129> stick<00:00:47.789> with<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.680> oops<00:00:53.510> so<00:00:54.510> as

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
so I tend to stick with that oops so as

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.220 
so I tend to stick with that oops so as
