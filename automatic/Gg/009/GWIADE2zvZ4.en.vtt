00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.609
 Hi all 

00:00:01.609 --> 00:00:06.029
 in this tutorial I'm going to teach you how to add video and music to a 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.229
 power Point presentation 

00:00:08.229 --> 00:00:11.379
 thing that is very frequent well let's start 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.279
 As you can tell, I have already made the slides that I will take as 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.140
 example 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.439
 even these two I do not use to add the video later 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:27.779
 now in insert let's sound and select file sound 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.770
 a small window will open as it is already here we have to look for the 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.110
 folder or whatever it is where we have the audio sound as you want it 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.830
 call hahahaha 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.030
 what we want to add to the presentation 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.810
 then we select it and click below to accept it to insert it in 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.980
 the presentation 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.540
 then this message will appear where we will click on 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.570
 automatically 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.610
 and this icon that appears sound we remove it and here and we put it anywhere 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.000
 but we do not erase it because we are not going to need them, much less on 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.170
 our positive life and yet it is the one that indicates that we insert the audio 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.939
 now in the audio that we insert we give right click and select 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.280
 defect options 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.200
 here we leave this like this 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.980
 and here below we select after 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.930
 where we put the number of slides that I want them to have 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.390
 this sound 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.450
 now in intervals the beginning we can put after the previous one and in 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.800
 sound configuration chule masters hide the sound icon so that no 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.800
 appear in the presentation of we accept 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.460
 now we can go to the presentation iberkeltia claims the sound and also 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.460
 The audio icon does not appear 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.080
 6 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.300
 harboe not as we can see we already have the audio in our 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.870
 slide presentation 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.680
 The next thing I will do is explain how to add a video to the 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.249
 presentation 

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:14.569
 we go again to insert and from there to film 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.359
 where we will select archival film and equally as we did for 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:20.819
 insert the audio 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.730
 a window will open where we will look for the folder in which our 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:26.679
 video 

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:30.239
 when we have found what we believe and accept 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:36.619
 when accepting, there will not be a small message which will give us two options 

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:38.139
 of selection 

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:40.949
 we select automatically 

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:44.979
 now there will not be a picture on the sheet where we insert the video 

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:50.169
 what we will do is enlarge that picture in such a way that it occupies the whole slide 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:53.169
 so videos in full screen day 

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:59.019
 since if you want it to come out in small size then you put it as 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:02:59.980
 they want it 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.759
 to your taste 

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:07.059
 Once we have customized it, we go to the video where 

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:12.179
 insert we give you right click and select effects options 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:18.540
 this window will open here we can leave like this and at intervals in start 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.649
 we put with the previous 

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:24.849
 now we go to movie setup and chulea screen mosum 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:28.149
 complete and we click on accept 

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:31.319
 until now the audio and video are joined 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:36.499
 Now what I want to do is add a plebeian form on the slide that 

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:39.819
 leave blank this I do so in the presentation 

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:44.519
 when you click on it start playing the video 

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:48.569
 brown this is already everyone's imagination 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:53.659
 Personalized it to my liking with color and size or as you say and it's ready 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:56.839
 all the presentation we did with audio and video 

00:03:56.839 --> 00:04:01.359
 If you want to learn more, it is better to practice it several times so that you do not 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:03.079
 forget them 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:08.639
 I hope you have served the tutorial and do not forget to comment and rate it if 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:09.979
 they like me 

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:13.049
 Now let's see how the video playback was 

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:16.229
 it was good 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.999
 until next time
