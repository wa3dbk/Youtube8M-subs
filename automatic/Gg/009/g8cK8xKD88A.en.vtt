00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.867
 Peek through the shadows 

00:00:10.867 --> 00:00:15.200
 Composition by poetry Masao Koga 1965 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.567
 Imitation 

00:00:21.767 --> 00:00:32.810
 Peek into the shadows, it's raining day 

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:45.833
 My feelings that I can not do on the moon 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:57.900
 To the fire of my heart 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:12.067
 I'm burning and crying 

00:01:26.216 --> 00:01:34.900
 Wow 

00:01:36.767 --> 00:01:55.530
 At least in a calm heart 

00:01:56.833 --> 00:02:17.670
 Take a guitar and nail it 

00:02:19.033 --> 00:02:40.570
 Where ever it rains Falling autumn 

00:02:43.074 --> 00:03:01.300
 Tremolo loneliness He is sad
