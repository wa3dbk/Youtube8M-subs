00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.370
 traveling from the little paradise in South Tyrol 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:09.559
 we go directly to holland 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.809
 more exactly after appelt gentleman in the 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.959
 near Arnheim and that in turn lies 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.219
 very close to the german border 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:17.360
 I imagine a sea of troops 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.119
 if I go to a dutch 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.960
 garden think but parents have a lot 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:22.849
 to offer more 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.710
 and yet he himself many fans garden 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:26.539
 not known at all and can confidently 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.789
 be called secret tip

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.410
 One also from the largest model garden park 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.870
 europe and if they ask themselves now 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.379
 what a model garden is all over the world 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.090
 should 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.239
 then come here the impressive 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.239
 answer 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.590
 none are alike 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.070
 and yet they all have one thing in common 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:02.769
 Anyone over 200 years old should garden 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:07.900
 a place to relax and play 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:09.280
 be to feel good and also equal 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.979
 no one else 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.940
 who owns these shoes well and why 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:17.290
 stand here 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.940
 but now in the gardens of discourage 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.280
 to go back once 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.440
 because they are so different 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.899
 and regularly surprise by new 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.170
 more and more visitors come out too

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:40.780
 fifteen minutes away and fetch 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.630
 always like to get suggestions for 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.270
 her own garden 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.420
 We have a courtyard and good there 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.729
 little sun is so much shadow what 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.590
 You can plant there accordingly 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.049
 use if I'm on a whole lot now 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.990
 Hosta and flag I rich here 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.030

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.590
 our garden is simply interesting 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.920
 also make that one not easy 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.979
 only such a green area had in this 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.970
 who wish namely everything turns around 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:16.239
 our piece of - without any 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.579
 this idea is still going through 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.890
 the centuries old materials and 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:23.890
 in old familiar opportunity not allowed 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.570
 heike slansky is enthusiastic about such 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.150
 you have accessoires in your garden 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.670
 even the last time they were here 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.600
 have the idea with the constant 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.790
 fence cribbed 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.090
 Now the garden is even more beautiful says 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.489
 I think they are very relaxing 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.320
 I had garden and I love when I am 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.930
 When I come home I am whole 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.030
 clearly working and if I am then 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.519
 place in the apple tree in the hammock 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.500
 Can a book or a magazine 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:53.260
 me it does not matter to her 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.940
 lawn mowing is what many people think of 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.290
 work and terrible I think so 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.939
 easy 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.319
 relaxation we accompany the three yet 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:04.439
 a little through the gardens of abt 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:08.030
 Parents pass the lounge and run gardens 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:09.650
 the asian garden and a whole 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.989
 special garden 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.709
 It smells wonderful of rosemary china 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.319
 ca 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.540
 and thyme are one more 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.620
 beautiful eye catcher and you promise 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.620
 a healing effect 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.620
 but now we want from willys lux 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.120
 One of the gardeners knows how many 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.840
 kilometer he was so one day 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.840
 travels 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:46.170
 I think eight or twelve kilometers and 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:50.600
 my school will go with me for a year and 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:53.010
 then they are quite good 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.440
 For six years he works as a 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.860
 Gardener in parents off 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:05.940
 I have a garden for a few 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:12.470
 years worked and much worked inside 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:12.470
 and now I am the whole day 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.000
 yes i love the nature and the fresh 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.739
 air too 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.479
 even the boss even if van ooyen has 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.610
 once started in a garden center 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:26.430
 but soon he wanted something of his own 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.650
 to put on legs let said 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.860
 Show us garden and materials 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:36.270
 Those who are not on garden centers but the 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:40.580
 are very important for those for 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:43.500
 horticulture that's a fair one if you 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:47.820
 the same with with write by 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:51.320
 poems around and emailing 0 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:53.760
 3 that 's the same always it's always new 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.520
 inspiration always new things the 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:00.060
 they want to show people and that is 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:02.580
 what happened here is once 22 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.529
 At the beginning he would have become a hectare 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:12.469
 did not think 

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:14.989
 25 years ago that's the shoes 

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:18.109
 By the way, gardeners are also one 

00:05:14.989 --> 00:05:21.369
 couple of willys lux is present and has 1 

00:05:18.109 --> 00:05:21.369
 a very special story 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:30.679
 It has to do with a visitor 

00:05:28.549 --> 00:05:33.079
 That was a man and a woman together 

00:05:30.679 --> 00:05:35.479
 and the man died last summer 

00:05:33.079 --> 00:05:37.819
 but no one has a letter 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:40.429
 if I get whether the training of 

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:43.639
 iman here manufacturer or probably because 

00:05:40.429 --> 00:05:45.589
 every time you go to the garden 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:50.739
 she is not all alone and it is coming 

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:50.739
 comforting that the souvenirs you buy 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.020
 a greater compliment than this gives 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:59.009
 it hardly 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.580
 for the gardens of appel, yes, of course 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:00.599
 certainly true 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.610
 Maybe they are the ones too 

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:05.069
 small talking devices noticed 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.900
 the visitors interesting details 

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:07.380
 whispered to the various gardens 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.660
 to have 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.370
 They belong to the whispering clock since 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:15.139
 This year also offered in German 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.139
