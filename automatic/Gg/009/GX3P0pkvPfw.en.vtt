00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
you of course you also have enhanced car

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.670 
you of course you also have enhanced car
integration<00:04:09.390> so<00:04:09.540> you<00:04:09.630> have<00:04:09.720> iOS<00:04:10.110> cards<00:04:10.440> aware

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
integration so you have iOS cards aware

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.530 
integration so you have iOS cards aware
you<00:04:11.160> have<00:04:11.340> integration<00:04:12.180> with<00:04:12.300> certain

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
you have integration with certain

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.930 
you have integration with certain
vehicles<00:04:12.800> for<00:04:13.800> the<00:04:13.890> first<00:04:14.130> time<00:04:14.310> it<00:04:14.580> basically

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
vehicles for the first time it basically

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.810 
vehicles for the first time it basically
dogs<00:04:15.330> properly<00:04:15.840> and<00:04:16.830> you<00:04:17.100> have<00:04:17.280> almost<00:04:17.640> like<00:04:17.790> a

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
dogs properly and you have almost like a

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.150 
dogs properly and you have almost like a
caramel<00:04:18.209> if<00:04:18.690> you<00:04:18.900> will

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
caramel if you will

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.310 
caramel if you will
so<00:04:20.700> that's<00:04:21.300> a<00:04:21.540> pretty<00:04:21.840> much<00:04:22.050> it<00:04:22.260> for<00:04:22.560> iOS<00:04:23.690> iOS<00:04:24.690> 7

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
so that's a pretty much it for iOS iOS 7

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.040 
so that's a pretty much it for iOS iOS 7
