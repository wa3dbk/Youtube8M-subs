00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
teasers that we have gotten it almost

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.170 
teasers that we have gotten it almost
looks<00:00:52.410> like<00:00:52.469> it's<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.770> television<00:00:53.280> pixelated

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
looks like it's a television pixelated

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.119 
looks like it's a television pixelated
screen<00:00:54.480> we're<00:00:54.719> going<00:00:55.020> into<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.230> brain<00:00:55.590> now

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
screen we're going into the brain now

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.310 
screen we're going into the brain now
the<00:00:56.190> footage<00:00:56.670> we<00:00:56.850> get<00:00:57.210> also<00:00:57.989> looks

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
the footage we get also looks

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.860 
the footage we get also looks
reminiscent<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:59.129> black<00:00:59.609> ops<00:00:59.820> 1<00:01:00.000> in<00:01:00.390> black<00:01:00.660> ops

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
reminiscent of black ops 1 in black ops

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.500 
reminiscent of black ops 1 in black ops
2<00:01:01.020> when<00:01:01.530> do<00:01:01.649> we<00:01:01.739> go<00:01:01.890> lots<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.640> pass<00:01:02.910> we<00:01:03.390> got

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
2 when do we go lots to the pass we got

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.910 
2 when do we go lots to the pass we got
a<00:01:03.539> lot<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.750> helicopters<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.559> things<00:01:04.830> along

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
a lot of helicopters and things along

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.609 
a lot of helicopters and things along
those<00:01:05.040> lines<00:01:05.600> so<00:01:06.600> on<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.810> campaign<00:01:07.229> side<00:01:07.500> of

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
those lines so on the campaign side of

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.289 
those lines so on the campaign side of
things<00:01:07.770> what's<00:01:08.430> probably<00:01:08.700> going<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.180> be

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
things what's probably going to be

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.550 
things what's probably going to be
happening<00:01:09.479> is<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.750> we<00:01:09.930> will<00:01:10.020> be<00:01:10.140> exploring

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
happening is that we will be exploring

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.370 
happening is that we will be exploring
alex<00:01:11.010> mason<00:01:11.189> Frank<00:01:11.729> woods<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.380> probably

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
alex mason Frank woods and probably

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.990 
alex mason Frank woods and probably
David<00:01:14.040> if<00:01:14.250> we<00:01:14.460> are<00:01:14.580> going<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.850> continue

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
David if we are going to continue

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.580 
David if we are going to continue
forward<00:01:15.420> because<00:01:15.689> David<00:01:16.020> really<00:01:16.140> didn't<00:01:16.439> have

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
forward because David really didn't have

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.190 
forward because David really didn't have
a<00:01:16.860> full<00:01:17.490> conclusion<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.240> his<00:01:18.270> own<00:01:18.540> storyline<00:01:19.020> I

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
a full conclusion to his own storyline I

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.440 
a full conclusion to his own storyline I
mean<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.680> was<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.830> little<00:01:20.060> personally<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.090> felt

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
mean it was a little personally I felt

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.820 
mean it was a little personally I felt
that<00:01:21.689> because<00:01:21.900> we<00:01:22.110> have<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.380> multiple<00:01:22.740> choice

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
that because we have the multiple choice

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.670 
that because we have the multiple choice
endings<00:01:23.340> having<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.820> pick<00:01:24.060> one<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.450> those

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
endings having to pick one of those

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.450 
endings having to pick one of those
probably<00:01:25.680> won't<00:01:25.890> be<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.040> route<00:01:26.280> they're

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
probably won't be the route they're

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.679 
probably won't be the route they're
going<00:01:26.790> so<00:01:26.909> we're<00:01:27.030> probably<00:01:27.210> going<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.570> be

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
going so we're probably going to be

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.300 
going so we're probably going to be
going<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.080> past<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.619> what<00:01:29.009> we'll<00:01:29.159> have<00:01:29.189> is

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
going to the past and what we'll have is

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.069 
going to the past and what we'll have is
alex<00:01:29.759> mason<00:01:29.939> Frank<00:01:30.390> woods<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:30.810> what<00:01:30.930> would<00:01:31.049> be

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
alex mason Frank woods and what would be

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.830 
alex mason Frank woods and what would be
even<00:01:31.290> cooler<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:32.310> if<00:01:32.970> we<00:01:33.090> got<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.299> subset<00:01:33.810> of

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
even cooler is if we got a subset of

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.999 
even cooler is if we got a subset of
that<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.290> we<00:01:34.380> focused<00:01:34.710> on<00:01:34.829> another

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
that and we focused on another

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.679 
that and we focused on another
characters<00:01:35.549> with<00:01:35.729> those<00:01:35.880> as<00:01:36.060> side<00:01:36.240> characters

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
characters with those as side characters

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.170 
characters with those as side characters
now<00:01:36.960> one<00:01:37.920> thing<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.250> will<00:01:38.520> be<00:01:38.640> going<00:01:38.909> on<00:01:39.000> is

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
now one thing that will be going on is

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.789 
now one thing that will be going on is
because<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.659> will<00:01:39.840> probably<00:01:40.110> be<00:01:40.350> in<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.619> past

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
because it will probably be in the past

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.530 
because it will probably be in the past
as<00:01:41.100> my<00:01:41.280> predictions<00:01:41.790> are<00:01:41.909> saying<00:01:42.150> now<00:01:42.360> it

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
as my predictions are saying now it

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.359 
as my predictions are saying now it
could<00:01:42.720> be<00:01:42.780> in<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.079> far<00:01:43.290> future<00:01:43.320> but<00:01:44.189> knowing

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
could be in the far future but knowing

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.160 
could be in the far future but knowing
treyarch<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.970> way<00:01:45.090> they<00:01:45.270> love<00:01:45.509> history<00:01:45.720> what

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
treyarch the way they love history what

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.690 
treyarch the way they love history what
they<00:01:46.320> have<00:01:46.409> done<00:01:46.439> so<00:01:46.799> far<00:01:47.009> there's<00:01:47.310> going<00:01:47.610> to

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
they have done so far there's going to

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.719 
they have done so far there's going to
be<00:01:47.729> some<00:01:48.090> aspect<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.140> is<00:01:49.649> not<00:01:49.979> in<00:01:50.280> the

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
be some aspect of it that is not in the

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.120 
be some aspect of it that is not in the
past<00:01:50.909> future<00:01:51.600> now<00:01:52.140> maybe<00:01:52.530> you'll<00:01:52.740> we<00:01:52.920> have

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
past future now maybe you'll we have

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.670 
past future now maybe you'll we have
future<00:01:53.579> half<00:01:53.880> Pratt<00:01:54.210> past<00:01:54.869> like<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.259> was<00:01:55.470> in

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
future half Pratt past like it was in

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.920 
future half Pratt past like it was in
black<00:01:55.890> ops<00:01:56.070> 2<00:01:56.219> but<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:56.820> primarily<00:01:57.060> see<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.750> being

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
black ops 2 but I primarily see it being

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.800 
black ops 2 but I primarily see it being
a<00:01:58.140> past<00:01:58.469> oriented<00:01:59.460> game<00:01:59.670> so<00:02:00.540> that's<00:02:00.689> what

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
a past oriented game so that's what

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:01.580 
a past oriented game so that's what
we're<00:02:00.899> going<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.079> get<00:02:01.200> is<00:02:01.259> we're<00:02:01.350> going<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.530> get

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
we're going to get is we're going to get

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.080 
we're going to get is we're going to get
past<00:02:01.829> oriented<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.520> campaign<00:02:02.909> will<00:02:03.060> be

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
past oriented the campaign will be

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.090 
past oriented the campaign will be
significantly<00:02:03.719> impacted<00:02:04.259> by<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.409> whether

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
significantly impacted by that whether

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.190 
significantly impacted by that whether
it's<00:02:05.369> because<00:02:05.729> all<00:02:05.969> we<00:02:06.180> know<00:02:06.329> is<00:02:06.479> not<00:02:06.600> true<00:02:06.659> as

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
it's because all we know is not true as

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.080 
it's because all we know is not true as
we<00:02:07.350> saw<00:02:07.619> in<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.829> one<00:02:08.069> that<00:02:08.220> snapchat<00:02:08.550> teasers

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
we saw in the one that snapchat teasers

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.460 
we saw in the one that snapchat teasers
things<00:02:09.360> along<00:02:09.569> those<00:02:09.750> lines<00:02:10.020> i'm<00:02:10.289> not

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
things along those lines i'm not

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.990 
things along those lines i'm not
entirely<00:02:10.679> sure<00:02:10.890> but<00:02:11.069> that<00:02:11.340> is<00:02:11.459> an<00:02:11.610> option<00:02:11.790> that

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
entirely sure but that is an option that

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.350 
entirely sure but that is an option that
we<00:02:12.180> could<00:02:12.330> go<00:02:12.510> now

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
we could go now

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.000 
we could go now

next-gen<00:03:11.739> since<00:03:12.010> they've<00:03:12.160> had<00:03:12.310> all<00:03:12.459> this<00:03:12.550> time

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
next-gen since they've had all this time

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.820 
next-gen since they've had all this time
is<00:03:13.030> really<00:03:13.450> making<00:03:13.690> zombies<00:03:14.170> an<00:03:14.290> interactive

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
is really making zombies an interactive

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.400 
is really making zombies an interactive
story<00:03:15.160> where<00:03:15.700> we<00:03:15.850> have<00:03:16.230> cinematic<00:03:17.230> cutscenes

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
story where we have cinematic cutscenes

in the beginning things along those

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.240 
in the beginning things along those
lines<00:03:19.330> so<00:03:19.750> we<00:03:19.900> get<00:03:20.049> to<00:03:20.200> really<00:03:20.440> know<00:03:20.590> what<00:03:21.130> is

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250

a new for who knows maybe you'll be
aight<00:03:41.440> if<00:03:41.650> they<00:03:41.769> boost<00:03:42.010> it<00:03:42.130> up<00:03:42.220> for<00:03:42.400> next<00:03:42.519> gen

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
aight if they boost it up for next gen
