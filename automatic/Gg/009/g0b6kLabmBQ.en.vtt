00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.100
 oil prices keep going up 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.080
 record prices are announced every day 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.220
 what we have left 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.510
 save money 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.670
 saving fuel is the alternative we have today before the high 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.670
 international oil prices 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.900
 and the problem is that the increase in the price of oil 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.900
 are directly transferred to fuel prices 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.080
 products that in the savior does not occur 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.860
 let's look closely at how to save fuel and of course save 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.090
 money 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.900
 because it costs us money 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.230
 We believe that we save time 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.110
 but actually closed up fuel 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.820
 we burn the thematic ones 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.820
 and we spent the brakes on the vehicle 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.540
 everyone 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.990
 red has highlighted 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.030
 salaries on the island 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.210
 It is not the solution 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.210
 to save 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.180
 Backing up of heating the engine before leaving is not recommended 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.360
 in addition to generating excess emissions of gases that damage the environment 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.969
 ambient 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:54.969
 waste the fuel 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:56.840
 best 100 of the car 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:57.770
 with my orders 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.220
 although he started the journey 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.570
 separate the motor if it is going to stop for more than 30 seconds 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.900
 re-start your engine spend less gasoline than keep it running 

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:11.580
 but it is underway 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.029
 I accelerate smoothly and brake gradually 

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:18.289
 do not forget to anticipate traffic conditions 

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:21.349
 accelerate and decelerate smoothly 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:26.159
 besides economic it is safer and also the rain I put the wear of 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:27.299
 the breaks 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:28.800
 when I go on roads 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.369
 keep the speed constant 

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:36.389
 the throttle pumping spend more fuel and what we are looking for is to spend 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:37.519
 less 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.479
 lead us within the speed limits set on the road 

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:43.539
 and inside the city 

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:47.469
 this implies savings in a 10 or 15% fuel 

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:51.179
 your car is not a warehouse 

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:54.249
 avoid carrying what you do not need the trunk 

00:02:54.249 --> 00:02:58.699
 the more load the engine of your vehicle works more and of course 

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:01.549
 that consumes more fuel 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.469
 also the pipe walk luggage on the roof 

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:06.779
 this reduces the performance of the car 

00:03:06.779 --> 00:03:09.249
 up to 25% 

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:12.699
 Do not drive fast with open windows 

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:17.529
 this is all that causes is to increase the aerodynamic friction and this 

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:20.529
 leads again to spend more fuel 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.389
 as much as possible reduce the use of air conditioning 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:30.279
 do not forget to make the appropriate adjustments to the engine to work well 

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:33.579
 keep the wheels aligned 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:38.659
 if these are fighting with each other, do not doubt it is only spending sums 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:40.129
 gas 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:44.269
 the simple magic fingers must be inflated correctly to the pressure 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:45.679
 recommended 

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:47.219
 if you follow this advice 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:51.329
 can improve the fuel efficiency between a 3 5 to the pro by 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:54.329
 hundred 

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:00.919
 we can not finish this report without recommending 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:05.179
 use public transport when the route was agreed 

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:08.179
 remember that this subsidy thing 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:10.660
 If you doubt the quality 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.140
 and amount of fuel that is served at a service station I denounced 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.389
 the 900 days 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.389
 check vehicle consumption periodically 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:23.639
 let's try caspian sea 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:26.189
 let's see which one yields the most 

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:28.110
 always make a flight plan 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.319
 plan the right route 

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:33.319
 if you can share the trip with friends 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.319
 They can share expenses too 

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:37.599
 and finally 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:42.319
 Look for the gas station with better prices and create a relationship with them 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:43.490
 fidelity 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:44.509
 remember 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:47.229
 in El Salvador we do not produce oil 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:48.449
 And it seems 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:51.449
 we will not have prices like years ago 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.789
 Ministry of Economy 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:56.030
 a government with human sense
