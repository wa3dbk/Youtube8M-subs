00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.240
 Y 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:31.360
 greetings to all youtube users 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:34.000
 this time before teaching them and in 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.930
 the roots I will explain a little 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.940
 more about the prospects 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.210
 I'm reading a lot and seeing the 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.000
 takashi seminars and he explains the 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.650
 formula that he does not occupy for as to 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.650
 light and as for many things 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.760
 so that you have 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.760
 the aquarium for example 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.310
 can see is like the 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.750
 ay you focus you can not see us 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:07.510
 also because it is already thick 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:10.340
 populated I have not done pruning why 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.200
 as I have enough plants 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.250
 they are the ones that I will occupy for him 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:19.250
 for the design of this new new 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.120
 aquarium then when do the balls 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.740
 well, it's enough for me to overcome 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.990
 to make the new aquarium then 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.450
 I still do not tail it but they can 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:32.570
 see that you can use this rock here 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:36.200
 in the bottom of the aquarium in the background 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:39.700
 there is this other mouth and this I did 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.700
 kind of house 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.020
 that gives you the shadow with this part of the 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.710
 tree 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:50.370
 so if they can see they use a 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.460
 kind of cloud 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.670
 in the aquarium and on this side I put the 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.939
 musician 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.450
 and here they do not lose anything because here 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:00.450
 use 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.110
 the generators of nothing 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.110
 floating 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.140
 and in the background there is another one already 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.140
 completely populated with moss 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.519
 to see the aesthetics I'm going to 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.170
 teach in the other aquarium like this and 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.830
 I'll show you the idea for the new 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.470
 for the new aquarium 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:32.910
 well here is the other aquarium this was 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:35.850
 another design this one was more symmetrical in the 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.810
 another composition was of my life is the 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.540
 fish tank in three parts 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.930
 that's the formula worries about attacking the 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:48.260
 laterals and the center there is one that remains 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:52.190
 completely symmetrical that is this and 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.560
 there is another one that was one third occupies loads 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:58.819
 a lot on this side 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:01.819
 and in these thirds this you leave empty 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:04.160
 let's say it applies to that formula too 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.230
 in the back that is the formula 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.250
 that most people tell you 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:12.040
 that you want to use in it 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.450
 I explain myself better they tell you that 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:18.370
 Larger plants the plants behind 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.290
 the medians this 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.659
 in this part in the middle part 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.480
 the carpet plants in the first 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:29.330
 part of the aquarium and it 's that same formula 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.040
 the most loaded 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.610
 is this part is 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.610
 one 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.430
 12 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:44.250
 that is the formula to occupy them divides 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.370
 in pen sentences 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:50.070
 It also deals with this side are several 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.400
 games you can apply both the front 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.710
 like in the laterals that formula 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:58.140
 also that symmetric part here is 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:01.900
 this symmetrical part since in the middle 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.790
 is this and this part as heart 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.659
 as you can see I put two roots 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.849
 inclined I put two rocks a tent 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:11.530
 towards here it is also very important that 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:13.700
 do not all do it completely 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.040
 symmetrical 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:20.019
 the rule that it occupies is a philosophy 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.019
 Japanese that is called to this 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.639
 the wise here 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:28.759
 and says that things like they were 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:32.090
 created by nature that does not look 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:34.520
 so artificial you have to follow a 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.670
 formula also the order of the same chaos 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.530
 in the nature 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.080
 and that's why this rock is also 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.199
 here 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.510
 in the agreement a rock that is in the 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:49.440
 there is another rock 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:51.450
 and until there is one there is another rock 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.940
 It is completely symmetric here 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.950
 nothing more pulse this sheet 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:05:01.490
 and then more than anything that was the formula 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:01.490
 that pushed one half of moss here another 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.770
 and that was the formula they used 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.080
 this aquarium can see here are thousands 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.900
 and about whether there was a city ​​of glass 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.020
 Web 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.390
 here are those who come to the beginning 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.740
 it was more secure 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:19.740
 bloopers always 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.890
 in sight 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.790
 in the next video I'm going to talk 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.340
 Hello 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.630
 the symmetry or the formula that I'm going to 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.630
 occupy for the new aquarium 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:45.139
