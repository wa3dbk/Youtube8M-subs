00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 hello everyone today i got myself 

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:08.639
 western digital external hard drive 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.769
 my passport ultra now I will 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.840
 unpacking and a small reviewer of this 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.840
 device if you're interested then go 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.990
 This Western Digital External Drive 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.660
 Available in three versions 500 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.700
 gigabyte 1 terabyte and 2 terabytes I took 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.279
 one terabyte is something mean to me 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.050
 best suited and there are 4 colors 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.970
 black but it's somehow boring 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.130
 red is definitely not for me later 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.500
 titanium and blue I have long decided 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.239
 what choose titanium and canopy undertook 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.430
 not all the same more fun when something bright 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.850
 lies on the table so let's get started 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.850
 unpacking 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:01:00.420
 open the box somehow surprised me 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:03.030
 Here, in theory, there should be a cover 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.900
 but for some reason he is not here later 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.330
 cable 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.399
 I do not advise losing and breaking it because 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.680
 here is some kind of very specific 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:14.670
 connector and it will be difficult to find expensive here 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:18.119
 hard drive itself is some waste paper does not 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.640
 interesting here is how we see it very 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.590
 little 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:27.450
 only one and a half centimeters thick 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:29.479
 and the quest is 160 grams but quite comparable to 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.580
 modern smartphones 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:36.000
 This hard disk supports of course 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.880
 yusbi is 30 but I can't feel it 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.190
 in the laptop only double ports here 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.990
 now let's do a speed test 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:48.390
 So we connect the hard drive to the usb port 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.049
 preferably 30 but I only have 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:56.310
 Double wait for where the necessary will be installed 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:58.920
 driver on your hard drive just yet 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.799
 start to blink light to hear the sound 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.400
 what is it working so set go 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.200
 We look here there was a hard disk 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.390
 capacity 930 megabytes slide 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.700
 format it will be like 960 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.440
 gigabyte later of course it 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.459
 It is desirable and probably will be divided into 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.410
 local drives 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.860
 so still it will be better here we go 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.940
 here here as we see there is software from 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.730
 western digital 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.040
 I don't know if I will use it or not 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:31.050
 but here there is for both for windows and 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:34.610
 for mac os here let's go further about you 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.990
 first write and read speed 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.570
 the final test will be only on 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.990
 beaten by war for beaten but it will be 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.890
 of course faster now we go 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.500
 crystaldiskmark before never 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:51.600
 enjoyed this program select on 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:55.920
 hard drive push scarlet expect 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:59.100
 as long as the test is going testing lasted 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.080
 about ten minutes and here you can 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.540
 see the results and don't know it well 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.880
 or bad as I say before, I just 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.280
 did not test hard drives do not know him 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.380
 desired speed but i tested on and usb 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.750
 double think on beaten and 0 will 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.970
 much better results let's go now 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.060
 just do the usual ts we will copy 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:21.000
 normal movie volume of about one and a half 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.780
 gigabytes on hard drives just 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.090
 let's see what time it is copied 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:30.210
 I think quickly enough considering that 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:33.230
 me and beaten by war beaten but it was 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.230
 much faster 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:05.110
 but as we see holds about 40 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.110
 megabytes per second fast recording 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:12.070
 fast enough let's see 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.070
 reading speed 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:27.919
 reading speed of around 30 megabytes 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:30.050
 seconds too well remind 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:32.710
 that i have used double in language 30 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.710
 will be faster 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.610
 In conclusion, I think I can advise 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.060
 you this hard drive 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:13.220
 so he is an attractive compact 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.400
 fast enough thanks for watching and 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.400
 until 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:38.710
 find some noise 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:38.710
 0 h3 or not he shall not be able to 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.050
 let's start unpacking
