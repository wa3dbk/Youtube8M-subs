00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.819 
you guys are doing the same or very
similar<00:04:11.699> weight<00:04:12.389> not<00:04:13.019> only<00:04:13.260> is<00:04:13.500> it<00:04:13.560> going<00:04:13.769> to

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
similar weight not only is it going to

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:15.860 
similar weight not only is it going to
be<00:04:13.919> a<00:04:14.099> lot<00:04:14.340> more<00:04:14.370> efficient<00:04:14.819> from<00:04:15.540> set<00:04:15.720> to<00:04:15.750> set

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
be a lot more efficient from set to set

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.319 
be a lot more efficient from set to set
like<00:04:16.199> i<00:04:16.320> said<00:04:16.590> but<00:04:17.039> mentally<00:04:17.669> I<00:04:17.699> feel<00:04:17.909> it's

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
like i said but mentally I feel it's

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.960 
like i said but mentally I feel it's
it's<00:04:18.659> more<00:04:19.139> efficient<00:04:19.620> because<00:04:19.709> like<00:04:20.070> you<00:04:20.760> are

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
it's more efficient because like you are

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.180 
it's more efficient because like you are
you'll<00:04:21.539> know<00:04:21.779> what<00:04:22.529> this<00:04:22.650> person<00:04:22.979> is<00:04:23.039> capable

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
you'll know what this person is capable

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.240 
you'll know what this person is capable
of<00:04:23.669> along<00:04:24.450> with<00:04:24.479> that<00:04:24.659> you<00:04:25.349> are<00:04:25.500> able<00:04:25.620> to<00:04:25.889> spot

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
of along with that you are able to spot

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.960 
of along with that you are able to spot
more<00:04:26.490> prop

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
more prop

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.400 
more prop
early<00:04:27.180> because<00:04:27.300> you<00:04:27.690> are<00:04:27.870> able<00:04:28.050> to<00:04:28.290> actually

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
early because you are able to actually

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.200 
early because you are able to actually
lift<00:04:28.740> that<00:04:28.950> weight<00:04:29.220> that<00:04:29.520> other<00:04:29.730> that<00:04:30.090> the

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
lift that weight that other that the

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.330 
lift that weight that other that the
other<00:04:30.420> person<00:04:30.660> is<00:04:30.960> lifting<00:04:31.410> so<00:04:31.650> it<00:04:31.950> just

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
other person is lifting so it just

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.710 
other person is lifting so it just
becomes<00:04:32.580> more<00:04:32.790> safer<00:04:33.570> and<00:04:34.070> so<00:04:35.070> on<00:04:35.540> so<00:04:36.540> what<00:04:36.690> I

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
becomes more safer and so on so what I

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.080 
becomes more safer and so on so what I
want<00:04:36.960> to<00:04:37.020> get<00:04:37.350> it<00:04:37.470> with<00:04:37.590> this<00:04:37.680> video<00:04:37.980> just<00:04:38.910> get
