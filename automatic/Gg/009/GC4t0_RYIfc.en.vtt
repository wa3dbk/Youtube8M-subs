00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:09.510 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.970 

requested<00:02:10.510> a<00:02:10.630> tour<00:02:10.899> of<00:02:10.929> the<00:02:11.170> facility<00:02:11.710> and

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
requested a tour of the facility and

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.360 
requested a tour of the facility and
they<00:02:12.880> denied<00:02:13.360> that<00:02:13.390> request<00:02:13.720> and<00:02:14.500> I<00:02:14.950> feel<00:02:15.160> like

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
they denied that request and I feel like

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.100 
they denied that request and I feel like
if<00:02:15.700> this<00:02:15.940> is<00:02:16.000> a<00:02:16.120> company<00:02:16.570> that<00:02:16.600> feels<00:02:16.990> like

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
if this is a company that feels like

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.410 
if this is a company that feels like
they're<00:02:17.380> doing<00:02:17.500> everything<00:02:17.890> right<00:02:18.180> then<00:02:19.180> they

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
they're doing everything right then they

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.240 
they're doing everything right then they
would<00:02:19.600> be<00:02:19.780> willing<00:02:20.230> to<00:02:20.500> show<00:02:20.680> someone<00:02:20.980> the

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
would be willing to show someone the

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.220 
would be willing to show someone the
inside<00:02:21.580> of<00:02:21.730> their<00:02:21.820> facility<00:02:22.300> so<00:02:22.540> I<00:02:22.720> think<00:02:22.930> the

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
inside of their facility so I think the

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.350 
inside of their facility so I think the
fact<00:02:23.440> that<00:02:23.530> they<00:02:23.710> denied<00:02:24.010> that<00:02:24.250> request<00:02:24.400> is<00:02:24.850> it

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
fact that they denied that request is it

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.180 
fact that they denied that request is it
makes<00:02:25.540> makes<00:02:26.110> it<00:02:26.230> a<00:02:26.290> little<00:02:26.410> bit<00:02:26.560> suspect<00:02:26.770> as

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
makes makes it a little bit suspect as

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.530 
makes makes it a little bit suspect as
to<00:02:27.220> what's<00:02:27.520> actually<00:02:27.700> happening<00:02:28.270> and<00:02:28.420> whether

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
to what's actually happening and whether

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.150 
to what's actually happening and whether
they<00:02:29.080> have<00:02:29.290> confidence<00:02:29.710> in<00:02:29.890> what<00:02:29.950> they're

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
they have confidence in what they're

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.220 
they have confidence in what they're
doing<00:02:30.490> a<00:02:30.640> lot<00:02:30.880> of<00:02:31.180> us<00:02:31.300> have<00:02:31.480> been<00:02:31.510> working<00:02:31.750> for

doing a lot of us have been working for

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.010 
doing a lot of us have been working for
decades<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:33.640> move<00:02:34.090> this<00:02:34.239> island<00:02:34.660> towards<00:02:34.959> a
