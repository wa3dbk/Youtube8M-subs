 we have to do good is something very 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.110
 simple first of all we'll have to 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.330
 come to what are these ramps that are 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.190

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:47.640
 I've been using you, what are you? 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.650
 squads recommend that the 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.780
 solution also now let's go down by 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.970
 what is this little ramp and we 're going 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.280
 to stick to what is this wall that is 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.699
 find here in the xbox is the button 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.170
 rte in the play what is the r2 and good 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.030
 let's go down until the water 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.890
 get more or less to the chest and we're going to 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.390
 point towards what is the wall and good 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.280
 will be that we change what the 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.049
 gun by the knife and now that it 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.370
 see what the game is and good as 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.390
 can see I'm going up what the ramp 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.400
 and it looks a bit forced what they are 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.820
 and when he tried to lower again the 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.620
 world and start to float then this 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.720
 means that the trick has already gone well 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.130
 now you can go fighting what 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.020

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.610
