factors involved in reporting of UFOs
one<00:04:16.079> is<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:16.799> factor<00:04:17.250> that<00:04:17.459> people<00:04:17.910> don't<00:04:18.329> like

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
one is the factor that people don't like

one is the factor that people don't like
to<00:04:18.660> be<00:04:18.810> made<00:04:19.049> fun<00:04:19.109> of<00:04:19.350> it's<00:04:19.829> we<00:04:20.100> call<00:04:20.340> it<00:04:20.459> the

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
to be made fun of it's we call it the

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.150

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669 
not in the 1950s so there's still this

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:47.089 
not in the 1950s so there's still this
connotation<00:05:45.539> of<00:05:46.140> something<00:05:46.470> is<00:05:46.590> wrong<00:05:46.800> if<00:05:46.979> you

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:47.099 
connotation of something is wrong if you

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:48.020 
connotation of something is wrong if you

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
so naturally people are not going to

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.670 
so naturally people are not going to
talk<00:05:49.740> about<00:05:49.920> it<00:05:50.190> that<00:05:50.670> makes<00:05:50.880> it<00:05:51.000> a<00:05:51.120> major

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 
talk about it that makes it a major

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.270 
talk about it that makes it a major
sociological<00:05:52.680> problem

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:05.800 

you

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.870 

you
