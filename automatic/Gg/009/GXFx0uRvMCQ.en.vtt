managed<00:02:04.230> to<00:02:04.290> push<00:02:04.530> out<00:02:04.800> Ashley<00:02:05.280> Cole<00:02:05.520> so

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
managed to push out Ashley Cole so

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.180

obviously he is good in that position
and<00:02:08.550> I<00:02:08.610> think<00:02:08.789> Mourinho<00:02:09.030> will<00:02:09.360> put<00:02:09.509> in<00:02:09.630> there

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
and I think Mourinho will put in there

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.880 
and I think Mourinho will put in there
next<00:02:10.020> season<00:02:10.259> as<00:02:10.619> Ashley<00:02:11.550> Cole<00:02:11.910> has<00:02:12.120> moved<00:02:12.390> on
