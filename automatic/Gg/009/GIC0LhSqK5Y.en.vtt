that if I pull the seat back off with it

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.209 
that if I pull the seat back off with it
it<00:02:16.450> forms<00:02:16.900> like<00:02:16.989> a<00:02:17.109> little<00:02:17.439> lip<00:02:17.650> that<00:02:17.920> I<00:02:17.980> don't

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:18.219

like and then right here we've got some
punch<00:02:20.530> äj--<00:02:20.829> but<00:02:21.790> it's<00:02:21.909> not<00:02:22.060> bunched<00:02:22.510> up<00:02:22.719> it's

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
punch äj-- but it's not bunched up it's

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.470 
punch äj-- but it's not bunched up it's
the<00:02:23.079> way<00:02:23.230> they<00:02:24.219> mold<00:02:24.489> the<00:02:24.700> carpet<00:02:25.120> so<00:02:25.299> that's

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
the way they mold the carpet so that's

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.149 
the way they mold the carpet so that's
the<00:02:25.599> only<00:02:25.750> two<00:02:25.930> flaws<00:02:26.200> I've<00:02:26.469> noticed<00:02:26.889> and

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:27.159 
the only two flaws I've noticed and

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:28.860 
the only two flaws I've noticed and
that's<00:02:27.250> probably<00:02:27.579> from<00:02:27.909> packaging<00:02:28.540> so<00:02:28.780> I'm

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
that's probably from packaging so I'm

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.330 
that's probably from packaging so I'm
sure<00:02:29.079> if<00:02:29.170> I<00:02:29.290> heat<00:02:29.469> it<00:02:29.500> up<00:02:29.650> with<00:02:29.799> a<00:02:29.859> blow<00:02:30.040> dryer

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
sure if I heat it up with a blow dryer

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.910 
sure if I heat it up with a blow dryer
and<00:02:30.370> push<00:02:30.760> it<00:02:30.939> it'll<00:02:31.810> form<00:02:32.109> itself<00:02:32.409> the<00:02:32.739> way<00:02:32.829> it

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
and push it it'll form itself the way it

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:39.589 
and push it it'll form itself the way it
needs<00:02:33.099> to<00:02:33.219> be<00:02:33.400> but<00:02:35.319> I<00:02:35.409> can't<00:02:35.620> complain

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:44.250 

and<00:02:40.599> that'll<00:02:41.379> be<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.530> end<00:02:41.620> of<00:02:41.739> the<00:02:41.829> video<00:02:42.010> guys
