00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.160
 Hi! 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.140
 Jacob from Unisport WebTV. 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:17.380
 One of the most important decisions to make when buying boots is which button system you should choose - 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.040
 - Do you need to take FG, SG, or AG? 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:27.160
 To look at it, I take a look at the three different in Nike's Hi-Vis collection - 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.860
 - and I start with the AG buds. 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.840
 AG stands for 'Artificial Ground' - 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.420
 - But what makes this octopus tentacle like texture? 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.360
 Let's find out. 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.020
 There are many kinds of artificial turf - 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.440
 - but the newer ones, like the one I sit on here - 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:00.440
 - is basically a blanket with plastic blades of grass, along with this plastic filling - 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.340
 - and it all lies on a concrete surface, - 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:09.560
 - which means the new art courses are smooth and never muddy - 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:17.180
 - and that means that playing art is much like ordinary grass - 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.360
 - even if it does not fit - 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.600
 - and that's why, along with the fact that many only have a pair of boots - 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.620
 - that we see many playing with FG boots on artificial grass - 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.680
 - Although it is not something we recommend. 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.860
 Instead, it is much better to use these AG boots, which are made for this surface. 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.980
 The reason for FG boots is not good at artificial turf, - 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.900
 - is that the buds do not penetrate the substrate - 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.540
 - in other words, you just run on top of the surface - 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.500
 - which gives more chance of twisting the ankle. 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:11.380
 The second problem is that there are fewer buds, which makes the pressure larger - 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.220
 - which is not good for your joints - 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.000
 - of course, this is something Nike would like to avoid - 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.540
 - so they came with the AG button system - 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.840
 - which has many more buds - 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.480
 - that are shorter, but at the same time hollow - 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.240
 - which gives a better grip - 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.660
 - better footing - 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.500
 - and much more comfort - 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.440
 - simply because you penetrate the substrate more. 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:54.000
 You also don't have to be a rocket physicist to see that there is a difference between the knob systems - 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.480
 - and although the first three are good systems - 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.520
 - Nike felt that they could take the technology one step further - 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.620
 - so they came with this, 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.280
 - which is the sole of the new Hypervenom Phantom AG. 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.660
 The difference between the two is that there are several support buds, - 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.400
 - as well as two acceleration buds - 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.060
 - and it's a wild AG button system - 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:27.080
 - It is a little more comfortable, and you can hope it will be on the other boots soon. 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.700
 Another thing worth mentioning is durability - 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:43.000
 - which can be a big problem for people playing with FG boots on AG substrates - 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:50.120
 - and this is because artificial turf is much more than ordinary grass - 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:57.480
 - This is because when you step on AG, you do not break up the surface as you do on natural grass - 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.280
 - instead, you push the material together, which makes it hard - 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.560
 - which increases the wear on the boot. 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.920
 FG boots are not made to withstand this - 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:18.700
 - and often breaks, and actually you lose your complaint right when playing with FG on art - 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.160
 - which is a shame. 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.000
 Fortunately, AG boots are made to do just that - 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.660
 - so you keep your warranty and have boots that last longer - 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.040
 - which is always good. 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.300
 So to summarize - 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:45.060
 - If you are going to play artificial turf, then I think it is a good idea to play with AG - 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:53.100
 - and although it means buying an extra pair of boots, there are many benefits to AG that FG does not have. 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.780
 You can use your FG boots on artificial turf - 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:03.620
 - But that's not something I can recommend because it would be miserable if they broke and you couldn't replace them. 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:11.760
 In addition, I really like the AG button system and I always have a couple on me - 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.700
 - because what if. 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:20.260
 But what about the AG button system, do you play with it? 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.020
 Throw your comment in the field just below the picture - 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.700
 - And if you have any questions, ask them too. 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.840
 It was everything from me that has chattered about AG buds - 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.520
 - remember there are FG and SG videos up there - 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.880
 - and we will soon be seen at Unisport WebTV - 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:39.840
 - cheerio ...
