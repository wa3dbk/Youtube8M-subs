 despite a commercial success rather 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.420
 mixed for the ds3 racing citroen has 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:15.610
 still decided to renew 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.619
 r experience by imposing the low 10 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.169
 on the cabriolet version of his city 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.060
 connected and with the exception of a roof 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:24.070
 canvas and five small horses 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:32.380
 additional the applied recipe is 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:34.210
 exactly the same the citroën ds 3 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.680
 cabrio therefore receives at the same time as his 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.690
 name bessines a hue 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.149
 exclusive gray matte adorned with a band 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.039
 red and especially a profusion of fiber 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:43.600
 of carbon the famous materials 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:45.550
 usually reserved for the elite 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.890
 the automobile emphasizes here the passages 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.679
 Wheels widened the sides the shield 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.719
 and the double herringbone citroën or 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:54.999
 the diffuser pierced with a double cannula 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.679
 exhaust to this treatment add up 

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:58.359
 some classic details like 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:00.429
 inscriptions on the central amounts 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:03.219
 the most distinctive element of this 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:05.350
 ds3 cabrio racing is obviously the 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:07.900
 canopy that shrinks in sixteen 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.430
 seconds up to 120 km hour the 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.990
 advantages and disadvantages remain the 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.240
 same as on the civil version of the 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.260
 cabrio with a laughing visibility 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.330
 inexistent 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.220
 once the hood opens and a certain 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.850
 lack of air compared to a real 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.130
 convertible 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.620
 inside we find carbon 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.420
 everywhere to the point that one wonders if 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.730
 does not serve a little to justify the 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.610
 35000 euros that costs this citroën ds3 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.770
 racing cabrio results it appears a 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.720
 little superfluous or even badly 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.700
 integrated in some places like here 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.440
 on this meter puzzle the 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.510
 fiber is also found on the 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.130
 center console the steering wheel or even 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.290
 the entourage of door handles 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.970
 in addition to carbon, we note above all the 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.100
 very beautiful bucket seats which ensures a 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.700
 excellent support for the driver and 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.530
 his front passenger but he is now 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.050
 time to see what gives this ds3 on 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.810
 the road a turn of key alarm clock the liter 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.150
 6 thp well known at psa and mini in 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.120
 a configuration announcing here 207 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.400
 horses and especially 275 newton meters of 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.509
 couple associated with a 6-speed gearbox 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.369
 properly staged and 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.989
 nice to handle it offers some 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.239
 vigorous recoveries in all 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:18.680
 situations and allows you to print a big 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:20.810
 rhythm to citroen and secret a sound 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.060
 not frankly play and a character 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.110
 mechanics close to a diesel without flavor 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.690
 in the high regimes 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.129
 the chassis is excellent with a 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.870
 lack of a couple effect a 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.610
 depreciation offering a compromise 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.920
 oriented towards firmness and a 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.299
 race behavior without fault 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.239
 so can not blame him for much 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:40.609
 at this citroën ds3 racing cabrios and 16 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.019
 are taken at this price there simply 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:43.700
 go along a little bit to have 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.260
 access to a mini john cooper works 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.810
 cabriolet which she is a real 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.269
 convertible and finally he misses 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.780
 a little extra soul for really 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:55.220
 justified the 35,000 euros she asks 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.409
 not fundamentally bad so the 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.750
 citroën ds 3 cabrio racing fails 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:01.819
 not to talk to us about irrational 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.950
 with the same brilliance as a mini remains him 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.750
 so for her a certain exclusivity 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.709
 since only 100 copies are 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.709
 planned at the moment
