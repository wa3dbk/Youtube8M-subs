collectors go after more but what makes

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.640 
collectors go after more but what makes
this<00:01:29.100> car<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:29.729> interesting<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:31.020> know<00:01:31.140> it's

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
this car so interesting is you know it's

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.010 
this car so interesting is you know it's
not<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.159> playable<00:01:32.610> even<00:01:33.450> back<00:01:33.600> in<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.840> day

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
not that playable even back in the day

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.520 
not that playable even back in the day
yes<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.220> has<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.369> 220<00:01:36.270> HP<00:01:36.479> which<00:01:36.810> was<00:01:37.020> huge<00:01:37.350> back

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
yes it has a 220 HP which was huge back

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.740 
yes it has a 220 HP which was huge back
then<00:01:37.590> yes<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.790> can<00:01:38.880> do<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.030> hundred<00:01:39.270> damage

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
then yes it can do a hundred damage

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.319 
then yes it can do a hundred damage
which<00:01:39.900> was<00:01:40.079> huge<00:01:40.320> back<00:01:40.500> then<00:01:41.240> pretty<00:01:42.240> much

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
which was huge back then pretty much

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.359 
which was huge back then pretty much
this<00:01:42.509> was<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.930> most<00:01:43.110> more<00:01:43.320> be<00:01:43.740> most<00:01:43.950> powerful

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
this was the most more be most powerful

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.690 
this was the most more be most powerful
card<00:01:44.579> in<00:01:44.729> existence<00:01:45.299> but<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.110> wasn't<00:01:46.350> playable

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
card in existence but it wasn't playable

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.130 
card in existence but it wasn't playable
here's<00:01:47.700> why<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.299> was<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.540> stage<00:01:48.840> two<00:01:49.110> which

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
here's why it was a stage two which

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.929 
here's why it was a stage two which
means<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.590> had<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.799> evolve<00:01:50.070> twice<00:01:50.579> which

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
means you had to evolve twice which

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.940 
means you had to evolve twice which
meant<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.390> couldn't<00:01:51.899> use<00:01:52.229> char's<00:01:52.530> are<00:01:52.710> until

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
meant you couldn't use char's are until

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.830 
meant you couldn't use char's are until
turn<00:01:53.159> three<00:01:53.460> at<00:01:53.579> least<00:01:53.790> it<00:01:54.420> required<00:01:54.720> for

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
turn three at least it required for

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.380 
turn three at least it required for
energy<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:56.310> could<00:01:56.430> be<00:01:56.520> any<00:01:56.670> energy<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.119> was

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
energy it could be any energy that was

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.810 
energy it could be any energy that was
its<00:01:57.540> pokey<00:01:57.810> power<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.560> could<00:01:58.770> just<00:01:58.920> be<00:01:59.460> any

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
its pokey power it could just be any

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.280 
its pokey power it could just be any
energy<00:02:00.240> attached<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:00.810> automatically

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
energy attached to it and automatically

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.889 
energy attached to it and automatically
become<00:02:01.710> fire<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.850> but<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.329> had<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.509> discard

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
become fire it but you had to discard

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.020 
become fire it but you had to discard

are<00:02:21.569> not<00:02:21.750> that<00:02:21.930> playable<00:02:22.379> so<00:02:22.769> why<00:02:23.370> was<00:02:23.610> it<00:02:23.790> so

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
are not that playable so why was it so

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.729 
are not that playable so why was it so
collected<00:02:24.450> back<00:02:24.629> then<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:25.170> why<00:02:25.379> is<00:02:25.439> it<00:02:25.530> so

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
collected back then and why is it so

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.470 
collected back then and why is it so
collected<00:02:26.189> now<00:02:26.510> well<00:02:27.510> it's<00:02:27.780> probably<00:02:28.109> because

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
collected now well it's probably because

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.140 
collected now well it's probably because
it's<00:02:30.480> probably<00:02:30.810> because<00:02:30.989> a<00:02:31.530> word<00:02:31.739> of<00:02:31.890> mouth

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
it's probably because a word of mouth

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.500 
it's probably because a word of mouth
for<00:02:33.150> example<00:02:33.629> the<00:02:34.010> birthday<00:02:35.010> Pikachu<00:02:35.549> at<00:02:36.299> one

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
this pretty much it the only reason was

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.440 
this pretty much it the only reason was
because<00:02:44.010> it<00:02:44.430> was<00:02:44.459> considered<00:02:45.000> to<00:02:45.090> be<00:02:45.209> a<00:02:45.239> rare
