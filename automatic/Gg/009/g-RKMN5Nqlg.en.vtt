00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 nice guys welcome today in 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.250
 this new video I'm here for 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.830
 present the seventh episode of the 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.049
 I'm sorry if you missed this 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.250
 period a little this series before 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.130
 all I want to ask you, though 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:21.390
 thumb up we support it as always 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.970
 really absurd like 200 300 I like it 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.910
 absurd so I ask you as many mi 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.460
 also like this episode 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:32.520
 you may have seen the first team one 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.780
 really strong brand with benz.it vi 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.460
 says lewis mi pare ozil rooney berbatov 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:42.329
 beard tav among other pompatissimo 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.420
 however, it will really be a game 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.090
 a really great game ie 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:52.410
 very pissed off because you think about me 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.680
 is 4 and I say four goals apiece 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.170
 berbatov's head really is an animal 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.570
 as you can see va equalize the reus 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.760
 then a thousand credits and then he again 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.270
 berbatov owen faller comes out as a 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.670
 complete stoned paramedic boh 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.610
 there is no stuck paramedical 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.180
 melee or better with langerak but does 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.909
 anything 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.729
 third goal by william this time 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.450
 my two are not good at all 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.140
 sokratis and mini and slip is 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.939
 this 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.770
 william which is not too high 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:31.560
 in short it is then fourth goal then 42 to 76 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.270
 finally with bearded it also comes later 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.890
 my moment of glory on soccer 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.840
 90s corner with hammers 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.180
 strangely I make one myself too 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.640
 strange, however, the ninetieth I do 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.970
 pussy anyway there is usually an exhibition 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.939
 weidenfeller usual shit and I lose 3 to 2 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:55.920
 therefore first defeat and among other things 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:57.630
 the only one in the 877 division I believe is not me 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.520
 remember with this team go to 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.049
 face this full team road 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.490
 of reserves I go to the second 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.110
 game 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.149
 I really like this team 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.690
 really so good guys because I have 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.099
 however it is also the reserves and is one 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.180
 great thing 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:17.610
 in each case second game other 451 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.060
 this most paid less expensive with nasri 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:24.590
 saints cazorla and oars anyway also 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.450
 this overwhelm him 10 min italian al 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.709
 thirty-fourth vegetarian I tell myself 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.380
 it's always a beast 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.420
 if you have to choose one of him and 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.720
 draxler I recommend him 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.730
 strangely in any case also comes the 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.380
 two to zero with a bender playing a game 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.580
 really deadly at the forty-fifth 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:46.260
 written key goal is not wenner veloz between 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.850
 advice because he is a midfielder 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.799
 here against balls I did not expect it 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.110
 really so strong instead the 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.530
 defensive midfielder I like 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.650
 really 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.830
 then he too, however, at eighty-sixth 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.380
 makes a goal with sturridge and practically 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:04.019
 makes 5 shots on his or her this 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:07.070
 single goal of replied does nothing 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.570
 I completely find grosskreutz then 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.910
 player who certainly proved himself 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:16.470
 a very good excellent reserve of that 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:19.920
 that marco reus so I can win 3 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:22.380
 to 1 and I do among other things with reservations 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.730
 hoffman also is strong guys go 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.579
 strong 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.220
 best in the field by him 9.5 type under 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:32.220
 and I win the title I go to play immediately 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.440
 the first game of division 6 mi 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.150
 it seems 7 I don't remember and meet one 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.299
 bundesliga really bugged paid 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:43.440
 paid buggata I go brace first goal of 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:44.940
 ruby but young with the passage of a vehicle 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.850
 which were not of a passage was a 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.280
 shooting, however, came badly gone 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.139
 sure how good they ever are 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.609
 fortunately he was around and 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:54.359
 I can then mark the fourth on 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:55.560
 first goal 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.840
 all 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.930
 after a while however the goal of his arrives 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.630
 never years certainly much more beautiful 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:06.810
 at the twenty-ninth a great lashing that 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:10.300
 wider fallara hole 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:13.690
 at the 65th point, mine comes instead 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:17.560
 of goal.com hot head great shot 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:21.010
 great long shot of marco reus ve 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:23.500
 i do revise royce that really is 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.060
 playing as god is what displaces him 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.740
 completely the opposing goalkeeper mi 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.120
 it seems venice who is doing a great job 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.960
 game 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.460
 obama young complete is not exactly ble 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.710
 mariano the Italian myth then more 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.510
 with a military italian limit to a 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.910
 complete the work with no blas what 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:43.450
 fuck i say in the seventieth so i go 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:45.669
 on 3 to 2 and I stay there because the game 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.780
 ends here even if I take a palo 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:50.870
 boehm ayane 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.970
 the game ends here at 9.5 and with 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.730
 this match closes the episode that 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.590
 I remind you to leave so many beautiful thumbs 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.630

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.639

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:07.790
