00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
this is the planet earth our planet it

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.289 
this is the planet earth our planet it
is<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.059> small<00:00:12.389> planet<00:00:12.750> wrapped<00:00:13.500> in<00:00:13.710> clouds<00:00:14.299> but

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
is a small planet wrapped in clouds but

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.380 
is a small planet wrapped in clouds but
for<00:00:15.450> us<00:00:15.540> it<00:00:15.750> is<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:15.870> very<00:00:16.109> important<00:00:16.560> place

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
for us it is a very important place

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:23.450 
for us it is a very important place
it<00:00:18.390> is<00:00:18.630> home<00:00:21.080> but<00:00:22.080> supposing<00:00:22.680> we<00:00:22.890> look<00:00:23.100> away

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
it is home but supposing we look away

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.939 
it is home but supposing we look away
from<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.000> earth<00:00:24.289> and<00:00:25.289> travel<00:00:25.650> in<00:00:25.830> our

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
from the earth and travel in our

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.240 
from the earth and travel in our
imaginations<00:00:27.080> across<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.560> vast<00:00:28.740> starry

stretches<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.849> outer<00:00:29.970> space<00:00:31.340> then<00:00:32.340> we<00:00:32.520> can

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
stretches of outer space then we can

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.639 
stretches of outer space then we can
imagine<00:00:32.850> other<00:00:33.420> stars<00:00:35.630> strange<00:00:36.630> stars<00:00:37.110> by<00:00:37.380> far

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
imagine other stars strange stars by far

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.940 
imagine other stars strange stars by far
than<00:00:37.950> ever<00:00:38.070> shown<00:00:38.370> in<00:00:38.489> our<00:00:38.550> night<00:00:38.790> sky<00:00:39.950> and

than ever shown in our night sky and

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:48.080 
than ever shown in our night sky and
planets<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:44.149> this<00:00:45.149> calm<00:00:45.750> serene<00:00:46.320> orb<00:00:47.090> sailing

planets to this calm serene orb sailing

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.000 
planets to this calm serene orb sailing
majestically<00:00:48.239> among<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.140> myriad<00:00:49.410> stars<00:00:49.559> of

majestically among the myriad stars of
the<00:00:50.100> firmament<00:00:51.379> perhaps<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:52.890> star<00:00:53.190> too<00:00:53.520> is

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
the firmament perhaps this star too is

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.950 
the firmament perhaps this star too is
home<00:00:54.690> for<00:00:54.960> somebody<00:00:56.090> can<00:00:57.090> we<00:00:57.210> imagine<00:00:57.449> the

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
home for somebody can we imagine the

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.660 
home for somebody can we imagine the
sort<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.260> people<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.739> might<00:00:59.010> live<00:00:59.219> on<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.399> star

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670

like<00:00:59.879> this<00:01:01.129> let<00:01:02.129> us<00:01:02.280> go<00:01:02.460> very<00:01:02.940> close<00:01:04.010> let<00:01:05.010> us

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
like this let us go very close let us

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.380 
like this let us go very close let us
look<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.820> listen<00:01:06.030> very<00:01:06.689> carefully<00:01:07.040> and

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
look and listen very carefully and

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.740 
look and listen very carefully and
perhaps<00:01:09.390> we<00:01:09.960> shall<00:01:10.140> see

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
perhaps we shall see

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:22.680 
perhaps we shall see
and<00:01:12.710> here

clang<00:01:28.930> they<00:01:29.930> seem<00:01:30.200> to<00:01:30.320> have<00:01:30.410> a<00:01:30.440> piece<00:01:30.680> of<00:01:30.830> rope

and now they seem to be having a bit of

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:51.400 
and now they seem to be having a bit of
argument<00:01:41.990> about<00:01:42.110> that<00:01:42.230> piece<00:01:42.560> of<00:01:42.680> rope<00:01:50.410> quite

right<00:01:51.830> -<00:01:52.160> that's<00:01:52.910> no<00:01:53.270> way<00:01:53.450> for<00:01:53.479> clangers<00:01:53.960> to

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
right - that's no way for clangers to

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:16.030 
right - that's no way for clangers to
behave<00:01:54.410> ah<00:02:13.930> now<00:02:14.930> that<00:02:15.140> is<00:02:15.290> major<00:02:15.560> clang<00:02:15.920> ER

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040
