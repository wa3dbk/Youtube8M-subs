have your audio jack your USB port and
your<00:03:31.290> power<00:03:31.470> button<00:03:31.620> I<00:03:31.980> kind<00:03:32.549> of<00:03:32.670> thought<00:03:32.850> that

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
your power button I kind of thought that

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.479 
your power button I kind of thought that
that<00:03:33.299> should<00:03:33.540> be<00:03:33.690> reversed<00:03:34.019> but<00:03:34.950> anyways<00:03:35.310> I

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
that should be reversed but anyways I

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:36.530 
that should be reversed but anyways I
guess<00:03:35.549> they<00:03:35.880> figure<00:03:36.180> they<00:03:36.299> knew<00:03:36.390> what<00:03:36.510> they

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
guess they figure they knew what they

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:37.580 
guess they figure they knew what they
were<00:03:36.660> doing<00:03:36.720> so<00:03:37.079> we'll<00:03:37.200> go<00:03:37.260> ahead<00:03:37.319> and<00:03:37.410> power

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
were doing so we'll go ahead and power

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.390 
were doing so we'll go ahead and power
it<00:03:37.799> up<00:03:38.750> either<00:03:39.750> think<00:03:40.140> feels<00:03:40.380> pretty<00:03:40.950> nice<00:03:41.160> in

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
it up either think feels pretty nice in

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.490 
it up either think feels pretty nice in
the<00:03:41.489> hands<00:03:41.970> and<00:03:42.090> I<00:03:42.510> can<00:03:42.690> sit<00:03:42.870> here<00:03:42.930> and<00:03:43.079> do<00:03:43.290> some

the<00:04:50.490> user<00:04:50.639> interface<00:04:50.850> here<00:04:51.330> is<00:04:51.570> different<00:04:52.110> oh

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
the user interface here is different oh

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.080 
the user interface here is different oh
by<00:04:52.650> the<00:04:52.680> way<00:04:52.800> this<00:04:52.980> is<00:04:53.040> running<00:04:53.190> a<00:04:53.610> dual<00:04:53.820> core

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
by the way this is running a dual core

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.540 
by the way this is running a dual core
processor<00:04:54.150> so<00:04:54.870> whatever<00:04:55.139> we<00:04:55.290> do<00:04:55.470> route<00:04:56.430> it

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
processor so whatever we do route it

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.190 
processor so whatever we do route it
which<00:04:56.940> the<00:04:57.150> roots<00:04:57.330> already<00:04:57.630> available<00:04:57.870> once

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
which the roots already available once

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.750 
which the roots already available once
they<00:04:58.290> get<00:04:58.380> clockworkmod<00:04:59.040> recovery<00:04:59.070> on<00:04:59.580> here

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
they get clockworkmod recovery on here

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.980 
they get clockworkmod recovery on here
we<00:04:59.910> could<00:05:00.030> probably<00:05:00.150> load<00:05:00.479> ice<00:05:00.690> cream

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
we could probably load ice cream

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.050 
we could probably load ice cream
sandwich<00:05:01.380> or<00:05:01.530> honeycomb<00:05:01.950> onto<00:05:02.430> this<00:05:02.550> tablet

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060
