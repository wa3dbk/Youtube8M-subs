you<00:00:04.620> hear<00:00:04.980> photographers<00:00:05.730> talk<00:00:06.060> all<00:00:06.299> the<00:00:06.660> time

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
you hear photographers talk all the time

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.350 
you hear photographers talk all the time
about<00:00:07.170> depth<00:00:07.710> of<00:00:07.890> field<00:00:08.210> what<00:00:09.210> they're

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
about depth of field what they're

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.089 
about depth of field what they're
talking<00:00:09.719> about<00:00:09.809> is<00:00:10.050> simply<00:00:10.200> how<00:00:10.559> much<00:00:10.800> of<00:00:11.010> the

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
talking about is simply how much of the

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.490 
talking about is simply how much of the
photograph<00:00:11.519> is<00:00:11.759> in<00:00:11.880> focus<00:00:12.360> in<00:00:12.540> front<00:00:12.870> of<00:00:13.200> and

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
photograph is in focus in front of and

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.160 
photograph is in focus in front of and
behind<00:00:13.530> their<00:00:14.130> subject<00:00:14.580> this<00:00:15.389> is<00:00:15.630> called<00:00:15.929> the

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
behind their subject this is called the

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.060 
behind their subject this is called the
zone<00:00:16.529> of<00:00:16.859> acceptable<00:00:17.670> focus<00:00:18.770> because<00:00:19.770> of<00:00:19.920> the

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
zone of acceptable focus because of the

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.640 
zone of acceptable focus because of the
physics<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.640> lenses<00:00:21.119> this<00:00:21.720> zone<00:00:22.020> extends

physics of lenses this zone extends

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.560 
physics of lenses this zone extends
forward<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:23.220> short<00:00:23.490> distance<00:00:23.699> from<00:00:23.970> your<00:00:24.269> point

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570

forward a short distance from your point
of<00:00:24.689> focus<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.350> twice<00:00:26.160> that<00:00:26.490> distance<00:00:26.699> behind

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
of focus and twice that distance behind

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.650 
of focus and twice that distance behind
but<00:00:28.470> in<00:00:28.650> reality<00:00:28.859> it's<00:00:29.580> not<00:00:29.849> just<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.269> point<00:00:30.539> of

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
using a telephoto lens with a wide

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.610 
using a telephoto lens with a wide
aperture<00:02:11.099> like<00:02:11.580> two<00:02:11.970> eight<00:02:12.180> or<00:02:12.450> four

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
aperture like two eight or four

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.860 
aperture like two eight or four
and<00:02:13.709> I'll<00:02:14.010> move<00:02:14.220> in<00:02:14.489> as<00:02:14.730> close<00:02:15.120> as<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.629> lens

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
and I'll move in as close as the lens

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.229 
and I'll move in as close as the lens
will<00:02:16.110> focus<00:02:16.190> like<00:02:17.190> in<00:02:17.370> this<00:02:17.489> shot<00:02:17.790> of<00:02:18.000> my

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
will focus like in this shot of my

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.770

daughter my focal length was 160 my
aperture<00:02:21.989> f/4<00:02:22.860> you<00:02:23.790> can<00:02:23.970> see<00:02:24.209> that<00:02:24.420> her<00:02:24.540> eye

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
aperture f/4 you can see that her eye

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.339 
aperture f/4 you can see that her eye
and<00:02:25.080> part<00:02:25.409> of<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.680> tattoo<00:02:26.129> is<00:02:26.370> tack<00:02:26.790> sharp<00:02:27.349> but

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
and part of the tattoo is tack sharp but

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.740 
and part of the tattoo is tack sharp but
then<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.860> focus<00:02:29.159> falls<00:02:29.610> off<00:02:29.940> so<00:02:30.360> that<00:02:30.540> by<00:02:30.720> the

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
then the focus falls off so that by the

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.289 
then the focus falls off so that by the
time<00:02:30.900> you<00:02:31.290> get<00:02:31.470> to<00:02:31.680> her<00:02:31.799> shoulder<00:02:32.280> it's<00:02:32.879> just<00:02:33.180> a

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
time you get to her shoulder it's just a

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.140 
time you get to her shoulder it's just a
nice<00:02:33.510> line<00:02:33.810> in<00:02:34.019> the<00:02:34.110> composition<00:02:34.769> I<00:02:35.010> did<00:02:35.970> this

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
nice line in the composition I did this

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.970
