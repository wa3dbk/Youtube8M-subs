like fireballs at a dragon and he moves

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.889 
like fireballs at a dragon and he moves
around<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.130> screen<00:00:35.250> randomly<00:00:36.030> see<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.690> said

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
around the screen randomly see I said

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.160 
around the screen randomly see I said
pick<00:00:37.140> random<00:00:37.680> numbers<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:38.899> you<00:00:39.899> learn<00:00:40.140> it

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
pick random numbers and you learn it

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.400 
pick random numbers and you learn it
very<00:00:40.379> very<00:00:40.829> easy<00:00:41.160> because<00:00:42.170> every<00:00:43.170> piece<00:00:43.379> of

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
very very easy because every piece of

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.740 
very very easy because every piece of
code<00:00:43.739> sits<00:00:44.250> together<00:00:44.670> like<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.000> puzzle<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.480> he

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
code sits together like a puzzle that he

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.420 
code sits together like a puzzle that he
would<00:00:45.870> take<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.200> mouse<00:00:46.350> stuffed<00:00:47.160> him<00:00:47.280> back

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
would take the mouse stuffed him back

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.240 
would take the mouse stuffed him back
together<00:00:47.610> again<00:00:48.079> so<00:00:49.079> let's<00:00:49.680> give<00:00:50.010> this<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.219> go

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
together again so let's give this a go

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.779 
together again so let's give this a go
shall<00:00:50.610> we

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
shall we

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.979 
shall we
