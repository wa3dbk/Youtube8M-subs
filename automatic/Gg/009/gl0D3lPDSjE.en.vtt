00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:09.360
 hello to all some time ago on 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.030
 caradisiac you could appreciate a 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.580
 comparative a little off the table between 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.830
 chevrolet camaro and the nissan 370z 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.630
 the American had literally atomized 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.170
 the Japanese knowing that it costs 39 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.359
 thousand euros 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.400
 it was really the vehicle to report 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.109
 price the most important pleasure of the market 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.689
 today we have the version 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.890
 convertible to 44 thousand euros we went 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.100
 dug his head and we did not find any 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.369
 competing 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.369
 [Music] 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.770
 what is saint pierre eh 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:44.960
 Well, this is a cat ram r300 superlight 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.340
 so when is not hold back then 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.620
 what is it is a us box 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.120
 seven who with the years has been 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.980
 improved by a small craftsman 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.340
 British 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:58.280
 so that a 2- liter 175 horsepower 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:01.220
 it's only 515 kg and the euro 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.620
 near that it makes me also made 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.330
 exactly the same price you're hot 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.330
 the camaro cabriolet is not good the 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.250
 camaro do you know it a v8 6 2 2 432 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.500
 horses and a v8 a little deflated of 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.460
 the test piece can deflate yeah and that 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.160
 does 2 9 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.880
 as for mr now and 44 thousand euros yeah 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.340
 here 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.690
 but hey that's the theory 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:26.080
 is especially appreciated on road of agreement or 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.080
 so that 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:37.060
 [Music] 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.250
 for the ktm no question of jumping in 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.020
 this break and then stupidly turn the head 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.560
 contact is something that happens 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.080
 prepare 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.150
 first the circuit breaker it is appropriate 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.490
 then insert sitting in the xiii 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.310
 lovingly tub then the 500's 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.130
 harness lovers do not forget to 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.760
 reattach the steering wheel and now we can 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.760
 finally start 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.300
 [Music] 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.930
 you are looking for a car 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.340
 exotic something that we do not have 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.780
 the habit of crossing every day and 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.490
 at every street corner these two 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.170
 cars are made for you two 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.340
 philosophy schools but one word 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.290
 order the pleasure 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.790
 alan siegel this camaro by the way 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.710
 rarely a discoverable brought us back 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.450
 this effect of the curve of the muscles all 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.840
 emphasized by 20-inch wheels and 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.610
 a look to be pleased at all spoil it ram 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.660
 and a UFO in the production of batteries 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.700
 current with one where a man 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.560
 from outside to the map too and his fake 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.910
 tunes of Formula 1 of the 50s but 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.900
 it adds a touch of modernity 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.900
 welcome 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.840
 with its carbon fiber front fenders 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.090
 a treat to see turn as soon as we 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.010
 solicits of baby on the plans are 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.670
 muscular this akron it growls and we 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.620
 asks 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.810
 Orleans Camaro is considering the road 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.579
 like a long river American points 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.560
 do not be reluctant to raise the pace of 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:59.150
 from time to time she will feel more 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.250
 comfortable on the straight and wide lines 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.650
 on small times the ideal compromise 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.620
 daily between faure pleasure and 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.450
 bonuses which says stick attacks with 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.769
 the r300 is that they deliver 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.329
 sensations from the first rounds of 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:14.110
 wheel with a print of speed 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:15.880
 equipped by the taste of shock 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.890
 the wind hardly starts the small 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.610
 windscreen and the position produced at the 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.130
 ground level 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.170
 every way out and an adventure it's a 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.550
 true concentrate of pleasure is 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.810
 specifically on the 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.980
 national and departmental 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.980
 a little less 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.720
 [Applause] 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.760
 this is the result of the races at the end of the 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.260
 race you got me a bass drum 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.280
 today is not that is a true 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.290
 move but it's a little bit 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.370
 like comparing a scalpel to a hammer 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.940
 piercer it's not really the same 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.470
 use 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.790
 and then we see here that it's the ratio 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.220
 weight power that makes the difference 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.440
 yeah but that's a price one that says good 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.780
 ratio weight power 10 no air conditioning 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.650
 no equipment not even bees 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.760
 style anything that is to say 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.640
 it's really a tool for the 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.140
 track not really for roads 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.820
 open not like the camaro ah yes 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.460
 it's sure that the camaro can be 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.810
 a calf on circuit at the reverse 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.610
 everyday it's really liveable 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.890
 comfortable even and then it's good 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.990
 equipped there is leather air conditioning 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.040
 so maybe the gps but hey bah it 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.980
 will say what brings them closer is the 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.390
 price and pleasure and after a coronation to 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.920
 his pleasure everyone finds his pleasure 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.920
 eyes or way 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.820
