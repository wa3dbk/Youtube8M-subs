structure just as simple as pressing the
button<00:00:42.250> we<00:00:43.090> build<00:00:43.390> our<00:00:43.690> cannon<00:00:45.540> switch<00:00:46.540> over

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
button we build our cannon switch over

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.990 
button we build our cannon switch over
to<00:00:46.780> Sokka<00:00:47.170> here<00:00:47.620> jump<00:00:48.100> right<00:00:48.310> into<00:00:48.520> the<00:00:48.670> cannon

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
to Sokka here jump right into the cannon

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.040 
to Sokka here jump right into the cannon
and<00:00:49.120> we're<00:00:49.240> going<00:00:49.360> to<00:00:49.390> be<00:00:49.480> able<00:00:49.600> to<00:00:49.660> destroy

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
and we're going to be able to destroy

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.160 
and we're going to be able to destroy
that<00:00:50.290> wall<00:00:50.560> to<00:00:50.829> the<00:00:50.950> north<00:00:51.870> now<00:00:52.870> that<00:00:53.050> that

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
that wall to the north now that that

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.870 
that wall to the north now that that
barricade<00:00:53.590> is<00:00:53.770> destroyed<00:00:54.220> I<00:00:54.250> can<00:00:54.490> jump<00:00:54.790> right

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:54.880 
barricade is destroyed I can jump right

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.090 
barricade is destroyed I can jump right
back<00:00:55.120> into<00:00:55.540> my<00:00:55.750> speeder<00:00:56.050> bike<00:00:56.290> and<00:00:56.829> take<00:00:57.040> it

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
back into my speeder bike and take it

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.250 
back into my speeder bike and take it
over<00:00:57.310> the<00:00:57.550> hill<00:00:57.730> to<00:00:58.060> attack<00:00:58.390> our<00:00:58.600> first<00:00:58.989> enemy

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
over the hill to attack our first enemy

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.000 
over the hill to attack our first enemy
base<00:01:00.360> by<00:01:01.360> destroying<00:01:01.660> enemy<00:01:01.960> bases<00:01:02.170> we're

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
base by destroying enemy bases we're

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.020 
base by destroying enemy bases we're
gonna<00:01:03.100> actually<00:01:03.220> be<00:01:03.430> able<00:01:03.520> to<00:01:03.670> take<00:01:03.850> those

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
gonna actually be able to take those

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.420 
gonna actually be able to take those
bases<00:01:04.449> over<00:01:04.720> for<00:01:04.989> ourselves<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:06.250> we're<00:01:06.340> going

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
bases over for ourselves so we're going

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.719 
bases over for ourselves so we're going
to<00:01:06.520> go<00:01:06.579> over<00:01:06.640> here<00:01:07.090> jump<00:01:07.990> out<00:01:08.170> and<00:01:08.409> build<00:01:09.400> a

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
to go over here jump out and build a

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.490 
to go over here jump out and build a
small<00:01:10.330> air<00:01:10.630> support<00:01:11.140> pad<00:01:11.380> I<00:01:13.260> don't<00:01:14.260> know<00:01:14.320> why

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
small air support pad I don't know why

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.130 
small air support pad I don't know why
but<00:01:14.770> my<00:01:14.920> favorite<00:01:15.400> is<00:01:15.550> the<00:01:15.700> ATR<00:01:16.180> t<00:01:16.390> he<00:01:16.840> runs

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140

point<00:01:18.760> A<00:01:18.850> to<00:01:18.909> point<00:01:19.000> B<00:01:19.240> really<00:01:19.540> quickly<00:01:20.049> I<00:01:20.229> like

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
point A to point B really quickly I like

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:21.550 
point A to point B really quickly I like
him

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560
