00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:20.329 
it's a champion 1200 watt generator it

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:26.639 
it's a champion 1200 watt generator it
was<00:00:21.050> bought<00:00:22.480> and<00:00:23.480> I<00:00:24.470> think<00:00:24.919> it<00:00:25.039> was<00:00:25.189> June<00:00:25.640> of

00:00:26.639 --> 00:00:26.649 
was bought and I think it was June of

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:30.729 
was bought and I think it was June of
2007<00:00:28.300> so<00:00:29.300> that<00:00:29.509> would<00:00:29.660> make<00:00:29.840> it<00:00:29.899> about<00:00:30.380> six

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:30.739

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
of use and a guy says hey dude give this

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.990

a<00:01:14.630> try<00:01:14.840> I<00:01:15.320> bought<00:01:16.130> my<00:01:16.280> first<00:01:16.310> three<00:01:16.790> of<00:01:16.820> these

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
a try I bought my first three of these

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:49.469 
a try I bought my first three of these
for<00:01:44.979> $99.95<00:01:45.979> love<00:01:46.460> it<00:01:46.610> he'll<00:01:47.030> has<00:01:47.299> apparently

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
for $99.95 love it he'll has apparently

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.140 
for $99.95 love it he'll has apparently
evaporated<00:01:50.479> and<00:01:51.520> as<00:01:52.520> you<00:01:52.729> can<00:01:52.790> see<00:01:52.850> by<00:01:53.090> the

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
evaporated and as you can see by the

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.820 
evaporated and as you can see by the
gauge<00:01:53.450> it<00:01:53.810> used<00:01:54.020> to<00:01:54.110> be<00:01:54.259> almost<00:01:54.380> to<00:01:54.740> the

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
gauge it used to be almost to the

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.670 
gauge it used to be almost to the
halfway<00:01:55.070> mark<00:01:55.280> and<00:01:55.790> I<00:01:56.720> figured<00:01:57.200> I'd<00:01:57.350> get<00:01:57.530> it

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
halfway mark and I figured I'd get it

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.240 
halfway mark and I figured I'd get it
back<00:01:57.830> out<00:01:58.070> and<00:01:58.280> use<00:01:58.430> it<00:01:58.640> again<00:01:59.270> later<00:02:00.250> because

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
back out and use it again later because

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.090 
back out and use it again later because
it<00:02:01.400> still<00:02:01.610> runs<00:02:01.850> just<00:02:02.150> fine<00:02:02.240> it's<00:02:02.869> just<00:02:03.140> we

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
it still runs just fine it's just we

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.200 
it still runs just fine it's just we
don't<00:02:04.280> want<00:02:04.400> to<00:02:04.460> leave<00:02:04.520> them<00:02:04.670> on<00:02:04.700> job<00:02:04.970> sites

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
I'm gonna plug this baby in I'll give it

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.480 
I'm gonna plug this baby in I'll give it
a<00:04:58.670> second<00:04:59.090> to<00:04:59.120> run<00:04:59.560> and<00:05:00.580> this<00:05:01.580> here<00:05:01.820> is<00:05:02.030> a

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
a second to run and this here is a

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:09.780 
a second to run and this here is a
Chicago<00:05:04.490> electric<00:05:04.970> harbor<00:05:05.270> freight<00:05:05.480> tools

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:09.790 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.780 

5/8<00:05:10.790> of<00:05:10.970> a<00:05:11.060> horsepower<00:05:11.600> I<00:05:11.750> think<00:05:12.640> four<00:05:13.640> and<00:05:13.760> a

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
5/8 of a horsepower I think four and a

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:18.820 
5/8 of a horsepower I think four and a
half<00:05:13.820> amps<00:05:14.360> hundred<00:05:14.660> 20<00:05:14.900> volt<00:05:15.550> so<00:05:16.660> I<00:05:17.660> see<00:05:18.620> four

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
half amps hundred 20 volt so I see four

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.370 
half amps hundred 20 volt so I see four
and<00:05:18.920> a<00:05:18.980> half<00:05:19.010> that's<00:05:19.220> about<00:05:19.520> 500<00:05:20.150> watts<00:05:20.380> so

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
and a half that's about 500 watts so

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:22.990 
and a half that's about 500 watts so
it's<00:05:21.530> a<00:05:21.590> 500<00:05:22.130> watt<00:05:22.220> hit<00:05:22.520> we're<00:05:22.670> going<00:05:22.820> to<00:05:22.880> hit

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
it's a 500 watt hit we're going to hit

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.870 
it's a 500 watt hit we're going to hit
it<00:05:23.120> with<00:05:23.240> and<00:05:23.890> let's<00:05:24.890> give<00:05:25.070> it<00:05:25.100> another<00:05:25.400> second

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
it with and let's give it another second

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.190 
it with and let's give it another second
here<00:05:26.000> I<00:05:26.030> don't<00:05:26.300> want<00:05:26.450> to<00:05:26.540> hit<00:05:26.690> that<00:05:26.870> thing

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
here I don't want to hit that thing

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.090 
here I don't want to hit that thing
until<00:05:27.380> it's<00:05:27.590> warmed<00:05:27.860> up<00:05:27.980> a<00:05:28.070> little<00:05:28.250> bit<00:05:28.780> but

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
until it's warmed up a little bit but

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.310 
until it's warmed up a little bit but
after<00:05:31.100> after<00:05:31.970> sitting<00:05:32.300> for<00:05:32.330> over<00:05:32.690> a<00:05:32.750> year<00:05:33.110> you

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
after after sitting for over a year you

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.610 
after after sitting for over a year you
would<00:05:34.280> expect<00:05:34.700> worse<00:05:34.910> out<00:05:35.210> of<00:05:35.360> it<00:05:35.480> but<00:05:36.290> you<00:05:36.440> can

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
would expect worse out of it but you can

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.340 
would expect worse out of it but you can
look<00:05:36.800> and<00:05:37.670> see

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
look and see

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.550 
look and see
all<00:05:39.500> the<00:05:39.710> cobwebs<00:05:40.310> a<00:05:40.700> lot<00:05:41.660> of<00:05:41.780> cobwebs<00:05:42.290> in

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
all the cobwebs a lot of cobwebs in

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.339 
all the cobwebs a lot of cobwebs in
there

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:44.349 
there

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:46.469 
there
it's<00:05:44.680> been<00:05:44.889> rough<00:05:45.129> it's<00:05:45.610> been<00:05:45.789> sitting<00:05:46.270> for<00:05:46.300> a

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479 
it's been rough it's been sitting for a

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:51.170 
it's been rough it's been sitting for a
minute<00:05:47.050> it's<00:05:47.919> just<00:05:48.159> covered<00:05:48.580> in<00:05:48.729> cobwebs

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.840 

so<00:05:51.810> let's<00:05:52.380> give<00:05:52.560> it<00:05:52.590> a<00:05:52.710> shot<00:05:52.740> time<00:05:53.490> up<00:05:53.700> on<00:05:53.790> the

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:53.850 
so let's give it a shot time up on the

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.910 
so let's give it a shot time up on the
stalling<00:05:54.180> no<00:05:55.050> more<00:05:55.260> stalling

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:55.920 
stalling no more stalling

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.170 
stalling no more stalling
there's<00:05:56.520> no<00:05:56.880> book<00:05:57.210> with<00:05:57.360> there<00:05:59.030> look<00:06:00.030> at<00:06:00.120> that

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
there's no book with there look at that

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.250 
there's no book with there look at that
baby

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:03.260 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:10.409 

voltage<00:06:04.100> is<00:06:04.280> excellent

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:10.419 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:15.080 

running<00:06:11.050> out<00:06:11.169> about<00:06:11.379> 131<00:06:12.189> volts<00:06:12.900> that's<00:06:13.900> good

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.090 
running out about 131 volts that's good

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.820 
running out about 131 volts that's good
extra<00:06:16.090> voltage<00:06:16.270> actually<00:06:16.750> it<00:06:17.080> makes<00:06:17.530> you<00:06:17.650> wear

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:17.830 
extra voltage actually it makes you wear

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.100 
extra voltage actually it makes you wear
these<00:06:18.009> tools<00:06:18.280> run<00:06:18.580> bad<00:06:18.789> or<00:06:18.939> you<00:06:19.030> can<00:06:19.060> run<00:06:19.300> 160

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
these tools run bad or you can run 160

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:21.510 
these tools run bad or you can run 160
volts<00:06:20.289> on<00:06:20.590> one<00:06:20.740> of<00:06:20.800> these<00:06:20.949> they<00:06:21.189> actually

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 
volts on one of these they actually

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.119 
volts on one of these they actually
perform<00:06:21.909> better<00:06:21.969> and<00:06:22.240> run<00:06:22.389> cooler<00:06:22.949> volts<00:06:23.949> go

00:06:24.119 --> 00:06:24.129 
perform better and run cooler volts go

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:26.820 
perform better and run cooler volts go
up<00:06:24.340> ants<00:06:24.759> go<00:06:24.909> down<00:06:25.150> so<00:06:25.569> less<00:06:25.870> amps<00:06:26.259> means<00:06:26.530> less

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:26.830 
up ants go down so less amps means less

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.619 
up ants go down so less amps means less
heat<00:06:27.090> so<00:06:28.090> there<00:06:28.419> you<00:06:28.569> go<00:06:28.689> guys

00:06:30.619 --> 00:06:30.629 
heat so there you go guys

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:33.869 
heat so there you go guys
let<00:06:31.629> me<00:06:31.750> let<00:06:31.870> her<00:06:31.990> sit<00:06:32.259> for<00:06:32.469> a<00:06:32.500> second<00:06:32.919> I'll

00:06:33.869 --> 00:06:33.879 
let me let her sit for a second I'll

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:36.820 
let me let her sit for a second I'll
shut<00:06:34.210> it<00:06:34.240> off
