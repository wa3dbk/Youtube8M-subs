chains and deeper pores what this means

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.370 
chains and deeper pores what this means
for<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:05.970> more<00:01:06.330> overall<00:01:06.689> hook<00:01:06.900> potential

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
for you is more overall hook potential

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.080 
for you is more overall hook potential

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:41.629 
vertical axis angle which is to paint up
in<00:02:40.469> the<00:02:40.560> air<00:02:40.650> for<00:02:40.859> me<00:02:40.950> this<00:02:41.129> balls<00:02:41.370> more

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:41.639 
in the air for me this balls more

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:45.020 
in the air for me this balls more
angular<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.480> longer<00:02:42.900> for<00:02:43.109> me<00:02:43.579> the<00:02:44.579> second<00:02:44.939> one

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
angular and longer for me the second one

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.610 
angular and longer for me the second one
that<00:02:45.120> we<00:02:45.209> have<00:02:45.359> here<00:02:45.599> is<00:02:45.689> a<00:02:45.719> pin<00:02:45.959> down<00:02:46.170> version

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
that we have here is a pin down version

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.709 
that we have here is a pin down version
we<00:02:47.370> started<00:02:47.579> out<00:02:47.639> with<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:47.819> 50<00:02:48.090> degree<00:02:48.209> mass<00:02:48.510> by

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:48.719 
we started out with a 50 degree mass by

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:51.140 
we started out with a 50 degree mass by
a<00:02:48.750> single<00:02:49.139> we<00:02:49.769> went<00:02:49.980> five<00:02:50.159> inches<00:02:50.519> from<00:02:51.060> the

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
a single we went five inches from the

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.509 
a single we went five inches from the
pin<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:51.480> my<00:02:51.720> axis<00:02:52.109> and<00:02:52.319> then<00:02:52.799> a<00:02:52.829> 70<00:02:53.220> degrees

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
pin to my axis and then a 70 degrees

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.640 
pin to my axis and then a 70 degrees
vertical<00:02:53.700> axis<00:02:54.239> angle<00:02:54.540> we've<00:02:55.139> also<00:02:55.290> got<00:02:55.620> a

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
vertical axis angle we've also got a

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.309 
vertical axis angle we've also got a
pull<00:02:56.040> about<00:02:56.669> two<00:02:56.909> inches<00:02:57.209> below<00:02:57.269> my<00:02:57.540> axis<00:02:58.109> on

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
pull about two inches below my axis on

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.409 
pull about two inches below my axis on
the<00:02:58.379> vertical<00:02:58.889> axis<00:02:59.159> line<00:02:59.609> this<00:03:00.090> gets<00:03:00.299> them

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:00.419 
the vertical axis line this gets them

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:02.030 
the vertical axis line this gets them
all<00:03:00.540> into<00:03:00.689> a<00:03:00.780> nice<00:03:00.959> strong<00:03:01.200> role<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:01.739> is

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
all into a nice strong role and is

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.379 
all into a nice strong role and is
better<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.400> start<00:03:02.609> out<00:03:02.760> with<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:03.150> better<00:03:03.269> on

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:03.389 
better to start out with and better on

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:06.200 
better to start out with and better on
heavier<00:03:03.659> oil<00:03:03.900> for<00:03:04.079> me
