00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
it's just not online right now I guess

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.019 
it's just not online right now I guess
we<00:00:20.539> we<00:00:21.539> we<00:00:22.170> just<00:00:22.199> did<00:00:22.590> not<00:00:22.769> anticipate<00:00:23.220> it<00:00:23.820> to

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
we we we just did not anticipate it to

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.419 
we we we just did not anticipate it to
get<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:24.510> much<00:00:26.210> here<00:00:27.320> so<00:00:28.320> many<00:00:28.590> people<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.400> so

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
get so much here so many people and so

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.020 
get so much here so many people and so
many<00:00:30.210> people<00:00:30.480> don't<00:00:31.019> want<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.230> come<00:00:31.439> join<00:00:31.740> it

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.030

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
because the our server provider said we

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.250 
because the our server provider said we
were<00:03:45.030> using<00:03:45.239> two<00:03:45.690> out<00:03:45.900> of<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.110> eight

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
were using two out of the eight

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.600 
were using two out of the eight
processors<00:03:46.650> that<00:03:47.100> they<00:03:47.489> have<00:03:47.870> just<00:03:48.870> us<00:03:49.610> that's

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
processors that they have just us that's

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.970 
processors that they have just us that's
not<00:03:50.820> good<00:03:50.850> this<00:03:51.750> so<00:03:52.200> they<00:03:52.470> shut<00:03:52.530> down<00:03:52.769> the
