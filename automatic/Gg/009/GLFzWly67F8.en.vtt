00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
ground moles call me a softie but I

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.150 
ground moles call me a softie but I
really<00:00:16.109> don't<00:00:16.289> want<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:16.590> harm<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.980> little

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
really don't want to harm the little

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.099 
really don't want to harm the little
guys<00:00:17.460> so<00:00:18.240> my<00:00:18.449> first<00:00:18.720> tool<00:00:19.050> of<00:00:19.199> choice<00:00:19.230> is<00:00:19.800> this

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:21.109 
guys so my first tool of choice is this

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:26.300 
guys so my first tool of choice is this
it's<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.289> sonic<00:00:22.740> mole<00:00:23.039> repeller<00:00:24.949> what<00:00:25.949> it<00:00:26.099> does

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
it's a sonic mole repeller what it does

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.179 
it's a sonic mole repeller what it does
is<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.699> actually<00:00:26.910> hums<00:00:29.480> like<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.720> at<00:00:31.380> 400

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
is it actually hums like that at 400

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.060 
is it actually hums like that at 400
Hertz<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:33.110> when<00:00:34.110> it's<00:00:34.260> driven<00:00:34.620> into<00:00:34.950> the

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
Hertz and when it's driven into the

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.530 
Hertz and when it's driven into the
ground<00:00:36.170> it'll<00:00:37.579> disrupt<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.969> moles<00:00:39.239> and

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
ground it'll disrupt the moles and

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.770 
ground it'll disrupt the moles and
hopefully<00:00:40.350> scare<00:00:40.829> them<00:00:41.040> away<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:42.600> nice

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
hopefully scare them away and the nice

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.430 
hopefully scare them away and the nice
thing<00:00:43.079> is<00:00:43.110> it's<00:00:43.559> solar-powered<00:00:44.270> so<00:00:45.440> hopefully

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
thing is it's solar-powered so hopefully

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.650 
thing is it's solar-powered so hopefully
it'll<00:00:46.590> run<00:00:46.680> continuously<00:00:50.180> so<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.239> get<00:00:51.420> this

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
it'll run continuously so to get this

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.540 
it'll run continuously so to get this
puppy<00:00:51.899> up<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.350> running<00:00:52.770> you'll<00:00:53.070> first<00:00:53.100> have

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
puppy up and running you'll first have

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.450 
puppy up and running you'll first have
to<00:00:53.760> drive<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.719> stake<00:00:55.199> into<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.590> ground<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:56.160> make

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
to drive a stake into the ground to make

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:11.600 
to drive a stake into the ground to make
a<00:00:56.489> pilot<00:00:57.090> hole<00:00:57.210> for<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.629> stake<00:01:10.070> okay<00:01:11.070> now<00:01:11.340> that

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
a pilot hole for the stake okay now that

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.700 
a pilot hole for the stake okay now that
we've<00:01:11.790> got<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.210> in<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.659> ground<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.320> actually

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
we've got it in the ground it actually

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.789 
we've got it in the ground it actually
sets<00:01:14.220> low<00:01:14.520> enough<00:01:14.850> but<00:01:15.540> if<00:01:15.840> you're<00:01:16.530> careful

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
sets low enough but if you're careful

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.070 
sets low enough but if you're careful
you<00:01:17.340> should<00:01:17.549> be<00:01:17.729> able<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:18.030> mow<00:01:18.240> right<00:01:18.600> over<00:01:18.930> top

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
you should be able to mow right over top

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.450 
you should be able to mow right over top
of<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:20.000> it<00:01:21.000> does<00:01:21.240> set<00:01:21.540> fairly<00:01:22.200> flush<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:22.860> mean

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
of it it does set fairly flush I mean

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.749 
of it it does set fairly flush I mean
looking<00:01:23.970> at<00:01:24.060> my<00:01:24.210> finger<00:01:24.570> here<00:01:24.869> it's<00:01:25.799> right<00:01:26.520> at

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
looking at my finger here it's right at

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.230 
looking at my finger here it's right at
like<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.360> first<00:01:27.600> knuckle<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:28.850> that's<00:01:29.850> plenty

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
like the first knuckle so that's plenty

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.210 
like the first knuckle so that's plenty
of<00:01:30.450> room<00:01:30.630> for<00:01:30.659> mowing<00:01:33.380> step<00:01:34.380> two<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.950> my<00:01:35.159> plan

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
of room for mowing step two of my plan

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.319 
of room for mowing step two of my plan
is<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.880> kill<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.049> moles<00:01:37.290> food<00:01:37.770> source<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.430> the

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
is to kill the moles food source and the

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.859 
is to kill the moles food source and the
main<00:01:39.479> sources<00:01:39.900> grubs<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:41.240> I'm<00:01:42.240> going<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.780> be

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
main sources grubs so I'm going to be

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.289 
main sources grubs so I'm going to be
using<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:43.409> grub<00:01:43.770> killer<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.399> spreading<00:01:45.180> it

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
using this grub killer and spreading it

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.010 
using this grub killer and spreading it
on<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.659> yard<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.950> do<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.990> have<00:01:48.990> a

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
on the yard and to do that I have a

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.880 
on the yard and to do that I have a
nifty<00:01:49.560> little<00:01:49.770> hand<00:01:50.040> spreader<00:01:50.430> here<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.890> it's

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
nifty little hand spreader here and it's

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.530 
nifty little hand spreader here and it's
fairly<00:01:53.130> easy<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.520> operate<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.970> has<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.149> crank

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
fairly easy to operate it has a crank

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.530 
fairly easy to operate it has a crank
mechanism<00:01:55.040> that<00:01:56.040> turns<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.610> little<00:01:56.759> gizmo<00:01:57.270> down

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540

so<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:06.869> can<00:02:06.990> adjust<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.860> amount<00:02:07.950> that<00:02:08.399> you're

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
so you can adjust the amount that you're

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.470 
so you can adjust the amount that you're
spreading<00:02:09.119> at<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.690> time<00:02:10.580> so<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:12.150> know<00:02:12.180> of

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
water it into the soil so that's what

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:08.930 
water it into the soil so that's what
I'm<00:03:01.260> going<00:03:01.470> to<00:03:01.530> do<00:03:01.739> next<00:03:06.739> and<00:03:07.739> you<00:03:08.580> can<00:03:08.760> see

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
I'm going to do next and you can see

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.160 
I'm going to do next and you can see
some<00:03:09.150> of<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.300> mold<00:03:09.570> damage<00:03:09.830> brain<00:03:10.830> here<00:03:12.170> so

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
some of the mold damage brain here so

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.259 
some of the mold damage brain here so
these<00:03:13.470> are<00:03:13.530> areas<00:03:13.860> that<00:03:14.130> I'll<00:03:14.519> probably<00:03:14.820> come

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
these are areas that I'll probably come

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.720 
these are areas that I'll probably come
back<00:03:15.480> and<00:03:15.750> treat<00:03:15.989> later<00:03:16.310> with<00:03:17.310> a<00:03:17.340> mole

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
back and treat later with a mole

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.800 
back and treat later with a mole
repeller<00:03:19.220> but<00:03:20.220> for<00:03:20.489> right<00:03:20.670> now<00:03:20.700> I<00:03:21.239> just<00:03:21.540> want

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
repeller but for right now I just want

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.190 
repeller but for right now I just want
to<00:03:21.989> kill<00:03:22.200> the<00:03:22.350> food<00:03:22.530> source<00:03:22.829> and<00:03:24.200> hopefully

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
to kill the food source and hopefully

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.229 
to kill the food source and hopefully
with<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:25.590> sonic<00:03:25.980> spike<00:03:26.430> working<00:03:28.040> they'll<00:03:29.040> uh

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
with the sonic spike working they'll uh

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.729 
with the sonic spike working they'll uh
they'll<00:03:30.239> start<00:03:30.600> to<00:03:30.720> go<00:03:30.870> away<00:03:31.019> here<00:03:31.500> pretty

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
they'll start to go away here pretty

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.440 
they'll start to go away here pretty
