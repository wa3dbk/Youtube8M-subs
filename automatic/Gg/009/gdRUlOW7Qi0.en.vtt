00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:18.360
 take the alley a little bit bigger than the 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:22.170
 What I'm using for me to do some 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.560
 where I'm going to put the 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.560
 flowers 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:41.400

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.370
 It has a shape of a chat beep 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.270
 So here I am going to make the leaves. 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.270
 first 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.290
 so here on this cake will not come back 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:59.400
 using that pin to make the 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.820
 flowers while I go straight into the 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.820
 cake 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:39.569
 so here I've done all the sheets 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:49.030
 Now let's talk about the flowers here in the 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:53.049
 half a kilo but where the leaves are 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:57.299
 I do a fill that for 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:57.299
 little flower do not get too deep in there 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.950
 this beak here that I'm using it is 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:09.579
 the nozzle of making flowers is that with it gives 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:13.540
 to make several flowers and read 104 more 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:15.790
 He has this one here for example that he gives 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:20.129
 to make a bigger flower 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:29.709
 he's the 127 he's the alley petal too 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:33.299
 but I'm using here I always 4 for 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:37.389
 make these flowers from the little flowers is 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:42.190
 You're going to lie down, huh? 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:44.950
 Here you will need the one I'm spinning. 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.720
 the dancer but I'm going to try to pass 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.120
 for you this video with the man because 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.010

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.040

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:05.010
 but I'll try to pass on to you 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:26.069
 You will see that it is not difficult to do 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:33.810
 I think it will be easier than it was 

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:45.479

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:48.259

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:48.259

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:37.260
 and to make the little button of that flower is 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:37.260

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:56.449

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:59.659
