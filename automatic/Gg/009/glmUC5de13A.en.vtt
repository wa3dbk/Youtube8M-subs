big<00:02:44.060> thing<00:02:44.240> because<00:02:44.480> in<00:02:44.660> league<00:02:45.110> races<00:02:45.530> that's

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
big thing because in league races that's

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.620 
big thing because in league races that's
a<00:02:46.100> good<00:02:46.310> thing<00:02:46.580> obviously<00:02:47.180> there's<00:02:47.480> no

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
a good thing obviously there's no

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.960 
a good thing obviously there's no
advantage<00:02:47.750> using<00:02:48.290> a<00:02:48.470> wheeler<00:02:48.770> pad<00:02:49.010> and<00:02:49.250> that

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
advantage using a wheeler pad and that

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.300 
advantage using a wheeler pad and that
was<00:02:50.120> obviously<00:02:50.390> a<00:02:50.480> big<00:02:50.660> thing<00:02:50.930> in<00:02:51.110> f1<00:02:51.710> 2014

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
was obviously a big thing in f1 2014

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.190 
was obviously a big thing in f1 2014
people<00:02:52.670> have<00:02:52.820> the<00:02:52.940> advantage<00:02:53.360> I<00:02:53.540> think<00:02:53.750> it<00:02:54.110> was

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
people have the advantage I think it was

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.990 
people have the advantage I think it was
with<00:02:54.380> the<00:02:54.740> pad<00:02:54.920> and<00:02:55.100> some<00:02:55.250> tracks<00:02:55.550> not<00:02:55.700> we<00:02:55.850> all

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
with the pad and some tracks not we all

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.610 
with the pad and some tracks not we all
knew<00:02:56.120> this<00:02:56.150> so<00:02:56.420> it's<00:02:56.870> good<00:02:57.140> they<00:02:57.320> kind<00:02:57.530> of

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
knew this so it's good they kind of

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.380 
knew this so it's good they kind of
equaled<00:02:58.160> them<00:02:58.250> out<00:02:58.400> because<00:02:58.670> he'll<00:02:59.120> see<00:02:59.270> it's

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
equaled them out because he'll see it's

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.450 
equaled them out because he'll see it's
a<00:02:59.450> lot<00:02:59.570> more<00:02:59.600> fair<00:02:59.930> and<00:03:00.010> hopefully<00:03:01.010> more<00:03:01.190> fun

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.460 
a lot more fair and hopefully more fun

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.190 
a lot more fair and hopefully more fun

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
trying by the game i think it does

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.699 
trying by the game i think it does
really<00:03:19.730> work<00:03:19.910> to<00:03:20.150> affect<00:03:20.709> multiplayer

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
really work to affect multiplayer

really work to affect multiplayer
practice<00:03:22.130> sessions<00:03:22.490> is<00:03:22.610> a<00:03:22.670> really<00:03:23.060> big<00:03:23.180> thing

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
practice sessions is a really big thing

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.870 
practice sessions is a really big thing
now<00:03:23.990> you<00:03:24.050> can<00:03:24.290> do<00:03:24.530> practice<00:03:25.160> sessions<00:03:25.490> in<00:03:25.670> a

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
now you can do practice sessions in a

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.310 
now you can do practice sessions in a
race<00:03:26.060> weekend<00:03:26.450> with<00:03:26.690> your<00:03:26.810> friends<00:03:27.230> and

race weekend with your friends and
that's<00:03:27.890> a<00:03:27.980> really<00:03:28.130> good<00:03:28.310> thing<00:03:28.370> because

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
that's a really good thing because

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.699 
that's a really good thing because
rather<00:03:29.209> than<00:03:29.330> just<00:03:29.570> qualifying<00:03:30.050> straight

rather than just qualifying straight

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.110 
rather than just qualifying straight
away<00:03:30.890> you<00:03:30.920> actually<00:03:31.370> have<00:03:31.490> some<00:03:31.640> time<00:03:31.850> to<00:03:32.000> get

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
away you actually have some time to get

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.699 
away you actually have some time to get
on<00:03:32.240> the<00:03:32.300> track<00:03:32.510> put<00:03:32.750> some<00:03:32.870> laps<00:03:33.050> in<00:03:33.230> real

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
on the track put some laps in real

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:34.960 
on the track put some laps in real
practice<00:03:33.950> for<00:03:34.280> the<00:03:34.310> session<00:03:34.700> rather<00:03:34.850> than

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
practice for the session rather than

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.850 
practice for the session rather than
doing<00:03:35.120> practice<00:03:35.570> race<00:03:35.720> beforehand<00:03:36.230> and<00:03:36.410> that

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
doing practice race beforehand and that

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.170 
doing practice race beforehand and that
just<00:03:37.070> is<00:03:37.220> better<00:03:37.459> for<00:03:37.640> league<00:03:37.790> racing<00:03:37.970> all

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
just is better for league racing all

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.580 
just is better for league racing all
together<00:03:38.300> the<00:03:38.840> AI<00:03:38.959> you<00:03:39.110> probably<00:03:39.410> have<00:03:39.530> an

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
together the AI you probably have an

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.350 
together the AI you probably have an
overhaul<00:03:40.070> which<00:03:40.370> is<00:03:40.520> awesome<00:03:40.730> because<00:03:41.060> now

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
overhaul which is awesome because now

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.460 
overhaul which is awesome because now
they're<00:03:41.480> going<00:03:41.600> to<00:03:41.660> put<00:03:41.810> up<00:03:41.870> a<00:03:41.930> fight<00:03:42.200> and

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
they're going to put up a fight and

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.800 
they're going to put up a fight and
that's<00:03:43.310> a<00:03:43.459> big<00:03:43.640> thing<00:03:43.670> because<00:03:44.000> in<00:03:44.330> career

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
that's a big thing because in career

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:45.940 
that's a big thing because in career
mode<00:03:44.840> that's<00:03:45.110> really<00:03:45.380> what<00:03:45.500> you<00:03:45.590> want<00:03:45.800> you

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
mode that's really what you want you

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.160 
mode that's really what you want you
want<00:03:46.130> the<00:03:46.220> AI<00:03:46.310> to<00:03:46.459> really<00:03:46.850> obviously<00:03:47.840> put<00:03:48.020> up<00:03:48.110> a

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
want the AI to really obviously put up a

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.960 
want the AI to really obviously put up a
fight<00:03:48.380> in<00:03:48.500> races<00:03:48.890> and<00:03:49.100> battle<00:03:49.700> for<00:03:49.850> position

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
fight in races and battle for position

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.400 
fight in races and battle for position
and<00:03:50.420> that<00:03:50.660> didn't<00:03:50.840> really<00:03:50.930> happen<00:03:51.080> in<00:03:51.350> the

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
and that didn't really happen in the

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.840 
and that didn't really happen in the
previous<00:03:51.650> f1<00:03:51.920> game<00:03:52.040> so<00:03:52.250> hopefully<00:03:52.670> they've

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
previous f1 game so hopefully they've

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.100 
previous f1 game so hopefully they've
worked<00:03:53.060> on<00:03:53.239> that<00:03:53.270> hopefully<00:03:53.720> they've<00:03:53.870> really

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
worked on that hopefully they've really

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.000 
worked on that hopefully they've really
hit<00:03:54.260> the<00:03:54.350> nail<00:03:54.380> on<00:03:54.500> the<00:03:54.590> head<00:03:54.650> with<00:03:54.830> that<00:03:54.890> one

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
hit the nail on the head with that one

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.949 
hit the nail on the head with that one
we<00:03:55.640> play<00:03:55.820> cams<00:03:56.060> are<00:03:56.209> probably<00:03:56.450> better<00:03:56.600> and

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
we play cams are probably better and

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.170 
we play cams are probably better and
they<00:03:57.560> really<00:03:57.890> are<00:03:58.310> true<00:03:58.640> to<00:03:58.790> the<00:03:58.910> broadcast

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
they really are true to the broadcast

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.090 
they really are true to the broadcast
inspiration<00:04:00.110> so<00:04:00.230> they're<00:04:00.380> more<00:04:00.470> like<00:04:00.650> TV

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
inspiration so they're more like TV

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.400 
inspiration so they're more like TV
style<00:04:01.370> and<00:04:01.700> I'm<00:04:02.390> about<00:04:02.720> that's<00:04:03.050> just<00:04:03.290> gonna

communicate back to the engineers which

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.920 
communicate back to the engineers which
can<00:05:20.760> be<00:05:20.850> awesome<00:05:21.180> because<00:05:21.270> it<00:05:21.360> just<00:05:21.510> adds<00:05:21.750> so
