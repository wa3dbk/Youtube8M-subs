00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:08.400
 we are with helio fiorucci stylist 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.440
 Italian and icon of Italian fashion in the 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.120
 world but today we are talking about another theme 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.030
 that of eating with him 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.920
 because fiorucci is vegetarian from 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.170
 how many years it has come to this 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.260
 in short, this decision 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.800
 but slowly I have to say why I have 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.060
 began to read something 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.810
 on the industrial breeding of the 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.210
 animals and I got a little scared for 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.079
 think where the meat comes from 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.390
 where they come from 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.469
 how animals are treated in 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.379
 farms 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.719
 should put put a stop and 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.750
 say you can't do this because 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.120
 animals are living beings beings who 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.399
 they suffer and I mean they have the 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.739
 affections their affections have their lives 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.680
 the man is very similar to the man not 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.469
 must feel a different animal from the 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.719
 others how it was to move to the regime 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.829
 vegetarian was difficult he found 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.470
 difficulties of its own 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.840
 practical in avoiding meat 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.700
 or not no I must say no I must say 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.220
 no I ate in my house 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.080
 meat that some of us in 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.390
 family still eat meat not me 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.470
 shock the organic in his 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.060
 power plays a lot role 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.310
 important 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.720
 yes also because I think that too 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.700
 when one says Italian instead 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.240
 you have to be careful because in the end 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.390
 to create the vegetables we say for 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.770
 human nutrition many times yes 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.060
 they use herbicides or others 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.130
 fertilizing not on other things they can 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.860
 to be really even them too 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.110
 harmful to the man's favorite dish 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.829
 elio fiorucci kitchen 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:51.060
 but I must say that I was lucky 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:53.549
 not to be a vocation carnivore 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.630
 we say because to me pasta is always 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.610
 liked 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.950
 the first always liked al 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.170
 cold soup I mean 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.759
 this becoming a vegetarian 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.740
 and also a question of not having had 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:09.459
 a great passion for meat a 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.290
 advice to those who are thinking of hardy 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.989
 approach the vegetarian diet la 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:17.140
 vegetarian or vegan food culture 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:19.980
 I say that you feel better as a health 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.620
 I think I gained a lot because 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.530
 obviously we are not born for 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.319
 our conformation being carnivorous 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.050
 both mouth and intestine both 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.090
 the stomach is not meat you and has 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.319
 maybe some of one and say downey you 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.910
 but we are not naturally 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.220
 carnivores we have become carnivores 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.370
 also because meat is a symbol of 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.769
 wealth compared to other foods that 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.280
 were instead considered the foods of the 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.920
 poor 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.370
 there must also stop this idea 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.709
 that good and I don't know 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.260
 the lobster is also good ragosta 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.630
 the idea of ​​throwing an animal alive inside 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.940
 the boiling water seems madness to me 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.970
 the important thing is to have the sensitivity for 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.230
 make this world grow a little better 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.190
 above all, here is the reasoning world 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.329
 very elementary if you want but very much 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.329
 effective because then it makes you feel good 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:19.590
 in perfect thanks a lot 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.590
 Though many vole thanks
