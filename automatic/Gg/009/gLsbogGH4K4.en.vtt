00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.899
 very good condition its saying that we are 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:09.320
 in minecraft 1.5 point 2 to see a 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:13.410
 pretty cool way is called fanfic the 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:15.599
 so much as you see adds different 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.789
 types of glass as if it were in brick 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.369
 of this this is as if it were brick but 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.150
 the broken is that it has some gaps 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.680
 out there and this simply bajabonico 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.930
 we also have stairs blocks 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.349
 integers and now let's see why it is 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.750
 that there is to be able to make crystals of 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.540
 colors and you know that to me all the 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.760
 These decoration modes I love 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.129
 as you can see and what the background looks like 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.520
 love time you see it and put some 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.210
 example of a different color used a 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.620
 color of a color and a different block 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.320
 that the normal block as you see here is 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.790
 the block as broken being different 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.590
 too much has a gap 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:00.010
 but little else I love the blocks 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:02.380
 so that they improve the decoration here 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.770
 we have another this is the normal block 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:12.240
 of the cracked block 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:14.979
 The truth is that the voice is a bit strange 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.130
 but well let's see this from here 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:20.770
 what is here yes that is very very epic 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.590
 over here we have the black I think it was 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.829
 but from this broken you're doing several 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.600
 tests this cool web this cool egg 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:32.450
 this is what you think exactly 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.549
 what you think are crystals so broken 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.670
 and make the bugs go slow or you 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:41.179
 it also hurts you and makes you 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.649
 damage and die evidently clear this 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:44.329
 to cheat pÃ¡ramos you have to 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:45.870
 fly a lot in fact there is a piece 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:47.490
 From home 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:51.360
 to teach pretty much everything 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.900
 there are as you see we have stairs 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.000
 glass torches 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.290
 doors deals of these that I have 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.090
 put here by putting them in some way 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.770
 I surrounded the whole house with crystallites 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.450
 of the dairy products you have in the 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.110
 description is that I love the 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.110
 crystals these 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.000
 the problem is how you see the object 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.420
 it is also destroyed I guess it works 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.030
 like a cactus maybe 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.819
 the object is destroyed and that 's good 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.209
 and our house the crafting table not 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.209
 works 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.480
 there is to decorate mola a lot 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.819
 has a glass house so I have been 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.769
 enchanted the stairs that I was left 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.660
 flipado with views of the east stairs 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.570
 red block proposes something 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.150
 berries gates to choose knots and the 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.760
 people are very cool the truth for 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.280
 decorating has incredible this to me 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.430
 cool this from a glass house is 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.660
 very very ethical here we have then in 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.490
 all colors and so on 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.620
 and yes security but I think it is 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:00.040
 passing an airplane 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:03.420
 if you hear it ok we already have a 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.420
 slight that that had not put 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.660
 It's really cool that I love them 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.800
 the annoying to decorate there this 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.270
 love also wow 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.490
 also that I love the votes for 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.210
 declare this I loved the truth 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:21.590
 for all glass 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.590
 it is one is a pass 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.910
 cold wave of government 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.040
 and this from here you can see the background but 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.550
 not quite as you can see there is a line 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.810
 whole of colored blocks 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:41.480
 here you do not see is normal yes 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.500
 like the good one because you've liked it 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:48.430
 you have in the description is very cool 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.690
 the truth is that it is bolt to egg 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.390
 the painters let go all the bad is that 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:56.190
 do not get destroy the object but good 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:01.230
 it's a good idea that of broken glass 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:05.510
 up did you like there are favorites 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.510
 as there is a lot to another chau 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:15.850
 and nothing more
