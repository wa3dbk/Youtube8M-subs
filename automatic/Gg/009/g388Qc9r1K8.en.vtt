was off i sized up the enormity of what
we<00:01:52.899> were<00:01:52.990> intending<00:01:53.290> to<00:01:53.680> do<00:01:53.880> pull<00:01:54.880> a<00:01:54.909> jumbo<00:01:55.450> jet

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
we were intending to do pull a jumbo jet

we were intending to do pull a jumbo jet
with<00:01:56.530> a<00:01:56.560> family<00:01:56.890> four<00:01:57.369> by<00:01:57.549> four

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.809 

I'm<00:02:02.660> not<00:02:02.810> sure<00:02:02.870> he's<00:02:03.110> going<00:02:03.230> to<00:02:03.290> do

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:11.720 

so<00:02:08.819> we<00:02:09.000> have<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.240> set<00:02:09.600> up<00:02:09.660> now<00:02:10.289> in<00:02:10.530> theory<00:02:10.830> this

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
so we have it set up now in theory this

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.110 
so we have it set up now in theory this
engine<00:02:11.940> is<00:02:12.270> powerful<00:02:12.810> enough<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.380> drag<00:02:13.830> that

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
engine is powerful enough to drag that

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.940 
engine is powerful enough to drag that
but<00:02:15.120> it<00:02:15.690> has<00:02:15.840> trouble<00:02:16.170> getting<00:02:16.200> enough<00:02:16.530> grip

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
but it has trouble getting enough grip

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.970 
but it has trouble getting enough grip
onto<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.700> tarmac<00:02:17.940> to<00:02:18.630> actually<00:02:18.900> move<00:02:19.709> it

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
onto the tarmac to actually move it

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.920 
onto the tarmac to actually move it
without<00:02:20.400> spinning<00:02:20.760> its<00:02:20.970> wheels<00:02:21.090> so<00:02:21.780> that

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
without spinning its wheels so that

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.000 
without spinning its wheels so that
reason<00:02:22.290> they<00:02:22.410> have<00:02:22.500> added<00:02:22.650> to<00:02:22.920> this

the only thing we've had to do is double
the<00:02:40.230> tire<00:02:40.530> pressure<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:41.220> cope<00:02:41.430> with<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.700> extra

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
the tire pressure to cope with the extra

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.449 
the tire pressure to cope with the extra
weight<00:02:42.470> although<00:02:43.470> Mitchell<00:02:43.860> and<00:02:43.950> have<00:02:44.100> warned

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
weight although Mitchell and have warned

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.820 
weight although Mitchell and have warned
us<00:02:44.580> if<00:02:44.850> we<00:02:45.090> go<00:02:45.120> over<00:02:45.330> 20<00:02:45.720> miles<00:02:45.900> an<00:02:46.020> hour<00:02:46.110> they

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
us if we go over 20 miles an hour they

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.590 
us if we go over 20 miles an hour they
may<00:02:47.010> explode<00:02:48.830> this<00:02:49.830> really<00:02:50.220> is<00:02:50.520> testing<00:02:51.150> to

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
may explode this really is testing to

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.580 
may explode this really is testing to
the<00:02:51.720> extreme

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.770 

I've<00:02:55.160> been<00:02:55.340> told<00:02:55.519> to<00:02:55.790> put<00:02:55.910> it<00:02:56.000> into<00:02:56.239> drive<00:02:56.750> and

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
I've been told to put it into drive and

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.360 
I've been told to put it into drive and
we're<00:02:57.170> in<00:02:57.230> a<00:02:57.290> low<00:02:57.410> ratio<00:02:58.390> so<00:02:59.390> you<00:02:59.450> kind<00:02:59.900> of<00:03:00.370> you

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
we're in a low ratio so you kind of you

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.830 
we're in a low ratio so you kind of you
multiply<00:03:01.849> attracting<00:03:02.330> force<00:03:02.510> because<00:03:02.750> you

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
multiply attracting force because you

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.449 
multiply attracting force because you
got<00:03:02.930> a<00:03:02.959> low<00:03:03.110> ratio<00:03:03.290> gearbox<00:03:03.590> and<00:03:03.950> then<00:03:04.129> very

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
got a low ratio gearbox and then very

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.850 
got a low ratio gearbox and then very
very<00:03:04.790> gently<00:03:05.239> on<00:03:05.569> the<00:03:05.629> throttle<00:03:06.260> to<00:03:06.590> about

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
very gently on the throttle to about

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.650 
very gently on the throttle to about
2,000<00:03:07.519> rpm

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
2,000 rpm

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.820

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.730 

that's<00:03:22.670> sixteen<00:03:23.090> hundred<00:03:23.390> rpm<00:03:23.750> and<00:03:24.020> I'm

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:24.740 
that's sixteen hundred rpm and I'm

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.360 
that's sixteen hundred rpm and I'm
pulling<00:03:25.160> the<00:03:25.250> 747<00:03:25.820> with<00:03:26.300> the<00:03:26.420> traffic<00:03:26.720> oh<00:03:27.370> my

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
you can't put the brakes on because

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.060 
you can't put the brakes on because
apparently<00:04:35.110> you<00:04:35.200> burn<00:04:35.260> the<00:04:35.560> distance<00:04:35.950> off<00:04:36.040> the
