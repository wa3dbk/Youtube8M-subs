 it was just a rumor by Ali Kranj and 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:22.929

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:27.130
 it is called grow erbol that would be in Spanish 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:28.900

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.760
 Reviews from my friends youtubers that do not 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.070
 it was necessary to read the first book of the 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.469
 saga to be able to understand it is just a 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.140
 rumor then I said I did what I read 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:52.600
 this book but Alberto what it is about 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.750
 this good book this book revolves around 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.539
 click to click if it's a girl that 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.250
 is in his last year of high school and 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:03.519
 the book basically tells us about 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.830
 how she starts falling in love and 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:08.830
 obsess with this guy named dylan 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.060
 and how she tries to seduce him but 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.070
 this is seen in everything 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.740
 has been because it starts to generate itself in the 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.840
 school a very strong rumor about 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.640
 she in addition to this also goes 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.549
 telling how is your relationship with your 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.829
 family and how is in general a life of 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:26.140
 a girl who is in her last year of 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:27.100
 preparatory about what I think 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.990
 the good book 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.450
 I had a very big prejudice 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:35.259
 he found out before starting to read it because 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.960
 says four girls three boys almost eight 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:40.960
 years all as real as you then 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.209
 I said as I in your site recontracts 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.240
 cover says the last year of 

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:49.390
 preparatory always in successive loves 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.399
 Secrets sex fun and so many dreams 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.080
 for fulfilling this is the story that 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:56.659
 changed the life of saná but also the 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:59.060
 of all the other friends of the group 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.880
 I do not know what kind of high school 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.100
 they attended this group of friends because 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.939
 my senior year in high school was not 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.310
 nothing like that a bit of prejudice 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:13.190
 say let's say I do not know what to expect from 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.900
 because these are these people do not know 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.030
 They look anything like me then I do not know 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.190
 what they say that they are all as real as 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.599
 I can start reading the book and I went 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.330
 knowing a little about the 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:25.459
 characters I must admit that if I 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.470
 they fell badly because it does not look like anything 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.329
 it was difficult for me to identify with 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.190
 the situations that they were 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:33.769
 living but this changed when I went 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.450
 knowing a little bit more about asia and I 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.579
 realized that if we have something in common 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.590
 the book is telling you about what 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:42.310
 Ashley wants to also enter a 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.690
 film school and that this is already 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.099
 producing a documentary in two like that 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.709
 you all know I'm studying 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:50.720
 communication and digital media then 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.370
 when to chinarras about how is your 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.190
 experience developing this 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.530
 documentary because I felt identified 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.690
 with her but out of that there is no other 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.950
 thing in common with ashley or with her group 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.760
 from my friends 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.860
 ok the book if it took me out several laughter 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.530
 since then to ashley and her group of 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.080
 friends, yes there are some 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.989
 experiences a little funny this novel 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:18.080
 I thought it was funny, I would consider it 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:20.569
 as a literary snack since it is this 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.569
 I read it after I finished 100 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:27.110
 years of loneliness and 100 years of loneliness 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:28.760
 He left exhausted and because of so much thinking and 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.340
 from suffering so much with the Buendía family 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.930
 then this how this book was like 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.180
 a break for this book I would 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.610
 I would recommend to the people who 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.450
 like for example series like gossip 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.099
 girl or skins or 'physics or chemistry' where 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.269
 the frames of the series revolve around 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:49.519
 to school and high school experiences 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:52.670
 couple party and things like that 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:54.680
 if you like those topics you can get 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.720
 to like this saga that as I said 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.090
 first book of this saga is the book of 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.950
 nothing is forever I think this has 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.190
 been all for today I hope that 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.890
 I liked it 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.520
