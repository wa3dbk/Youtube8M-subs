okay so we've got the Mogu HDTV antenna
with<00:00:05.400> the<00:00:05.670> antenna<00:00:06.390> wire<00:00:06.690> that's<00:00:07.560> my<00:00:08.460> HDTV

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
with the antenna wire that's my HDTV

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.360 
with the antenna wire that's my HDTV
that's<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.719> antenna<00:00:10.170> in<00:00:11.000> and<00:00:13.130> just<00:00:14.130> plug<00:00:14.309> that

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
that's the antenna in and just plug that

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.890 
that's the antenna in and just plug that
in<00:00:15.740> okay<00:00:16.740> so<00:00:16.800> after<00:00:17.310> we<00:00:17.430> you<00:00:17.520> plug<00:00:17.789> it<00:00:17.940> in<00:00:18.090> plug

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.439 
in okay so after we you plug it in plug
the<00:00:19.109> antenna<00:00:19.439> wire<00:00:19.680> in<00:00:19.949> now<00:00:20.789> we<00:00:20.850> just<00:00:21.150> got<00:00:21.330> to

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
the antenna wire in now we just got to

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.560 
the antenna wire in now we just got to
find<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.869> spot<00:00:22.140> for<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.560> mo<00:00:22.769> on<00:00:23.720> the<00:00:24.720> wall<00:00:24.930> and

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
find a spot for the mo on the wall and

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.820 
find a spot for the mo on the wall and
we're<00:00:27.570> going<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.750> put<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.140> up<00:00:28.260> with<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.470> little

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
we're going to put it up with a little

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.950 
we're going to put it up with a little
sticker<00:00:29.130> velcro<00:00:29.699> stickers<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.539> can<00:00:30.720> put

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
sticker velcro stickers you can put

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.350 
sticker velcro stickers you can put
whichever<00:00:31.619> side<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:32.070> choose<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.790> black<00:00:33.030> side

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
or the white side so one one of the

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.459 
or the white side so one one of the
amplifier<00:00:38.730> features<00:00:39.239> that's<00:00:39.450> really<00:00:39.899> cool<00:00:40.170> is

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
amplifier features that's really cool is

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.819 
amplifier features that's really cool is
that<00:00:40.850> if<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:42.000> don't<00:00:42.149> want<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.899> plug<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.290> into<00:00:43.559> a

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
that if you don't want to plug it into a

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.299 
that if you don't want to plug it into a
wall<00:00:44.370> socket<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:45.149> don't<00:00:45.300> have<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.840> spare

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
wall socket you don't have that a spare

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.600 
wall socket you don't have that a spare
plug<00:00:47.309> in<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:48.329> can<00:00:48.539> use<00:00:48.840> them<00:00:49.280> just<00:00:50.280> straight

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
plug in you can use them just straight

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.639 
plug in you can use them just straight
up<00:00:50.640> USB<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.390> can<00:00:51.570> take<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.899> power<00:00:52.079> adapter

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
up USB you can take the power adapter

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.770 
up USB you can take the power adapter
off<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.930> most<00:00:54.930> HD<00:00:55.410> TVs<00:00:56.100> come<00:00:56.460> with<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.780> USB

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
off and most HD TVs come with a USB

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:05.000 
off and most HD TVs come with a USB
input<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.809> plug<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.989> in<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:02.539> the<00:01:03.539> mo<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:04.170> on

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
input so you plug it in and the mo is on

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:19.700 
input so you plug it in and the mo is on
and<00:01:05.610> amplified

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.840 

so<00:01:20.340> 56<00:01:21.150> channels<00:01:23.360> way<00:01:25.160> way<00:01:26.160> better<00:01:26.370> than<00:01:26.670> the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
so 56 channels way way better than the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.520 
so 56 channels way way better than the
two<00:01:27.360> channels<00:01:29.000> the<00:01:30.000> like<00:01:30.960> one<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.380> half

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
two channels the like one and a half

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:42.680 
two channels the like one and a half
channels<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.160> was<00:01:32.310> picking<00:01:32.610> up<00:01:32.880> earlier<00:01:41.690> this

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
channels I was picking up earlier this

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.050 
channels I was picking up earlier this
is<00:01:42.900> port<00:01:43.229> guns<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.979> do<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.580> want

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
is port guns and do you want

00:01:45.060 --> 00:02:03.740 
is port guns and do you want
oh<00:01:47.840> he's<00:01:51.530> not<00:01:55.880> literally<00:01:56.880> oh<00:01:58.580> my<00:01:59.610> except<00:02:02.690> Wow

yeah<00:02:05.300> this<00:02:06.300> is<00:02:06.479> insane<00:02:07.580> my<00:02:08.580> mother's

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:27.900 

Nene<00:02:17.540> Birds<00:02:18.540> used<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:20.900> you<00:02:21.900> know

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.390 

so<00:02:28.660> I<00:02:29.140> have<00:02:29.350> a<00:02:29.380> bunch<00:02:29.740> of<00:02:29.980> HD<00:02:30.580> channels<00:02:31.120> I

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
so I have a bunch of HD channels I

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.720 
so I have a bunch of HD channels I
definitely<00:02:33.400> think<00:02:33.580> it<00:02:33.790> was<00:02:33.820> worth<00:02:34.150> it<00:02:34.420> I

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
definitely think it was worth it I

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.490 
definitely think it was worth it I
didn't<00:02:36.730> even<00:02:38.100> move<00:02:39.690> move<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:40.840> mobile<00:02:41.020> around

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
didn't even move move the mobile around

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.770 
didn't even move move the mobile around
that<00:02:41.680> much<00:02:41.920> I<00:02:42.130> actually<00:02:42.310> just<00:02:42.880> hung<00:02:43.360> it<00:02:43.510> up<00:02:43.600> on

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
that much I actually just hung it up on

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:52.980 
that much I actually just hung it up on
my<00:02:43.900> wall<00:02:46.350> hung<00:02:47.350> it<00:02:47.530> up<00:02:47.620> on<00:02:47.830> the<00:02:48.010> drapery<00:02:51.930> yeah<00:02:52.930> I

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
my wall hung it up on the drapery yeah I

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.080 
my wall hung it up on the drapery yeah I
guess<00:02:53.200> that<00:02:53.380> channel<00:02:53.710> doesn't<00:02:54.040> count<00:02:54.220> now<00:02:54.520> do

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
guess that channel doesn't count now do

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:13.150 
guess that channel doesn't count now do
this<00:02:55.360> at<00:02:55.570> channel<00:03:06.480> constant<00:03:07.480> so<00:03:07.660> accurate

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:20.140 

ah

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.340 

obviously<00:03:21.150> we<00:03:21.270> got<00:03:21.450> off<00:03:21.660> of<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:21.930> wrong<00:03:22.110> foot

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
obviously we got off of the wrong foot

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:30.910 
obviously we got off of the wrong foot
so<00:03:22.950> I<00:03:23.670> would<00:03:23.820> be<00:03:23.910> completely<00:03:24.330> candid<00:03:24.510> yeah

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:39.800 

I'm<00:03:31.920> like<00:03:32.220> you<00:03:33.860> know<00:03:38.420> they're<00:03:39.420> coming<00:03:39.750> along

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
I'm like you know they're coming along

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.080 
I'm like you know they're coming along
