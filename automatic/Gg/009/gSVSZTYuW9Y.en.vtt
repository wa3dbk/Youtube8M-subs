00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
informations you can decide whether you

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.350

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030 
because Ubisoft felt that this was

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.420 
because Ubisoft felt that this was

and therefore it's going to work in a
different<00:05:47.400> way<00:05:47.640> however<00:05:47.940> we<00:05:48.660> don't<00:05:49.590> really

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
different way however we don't really

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.570 
different way however we don't really
know<00:05:50.040> the<00:05:50.190> specifics<00:05:50.760> about<00:05:50.910> this<00:05:51.270> just<00:05:51.630> yet

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
know the specifics about this just yet

you gain recruits as I've said by for

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.020 
you gain recruits as I've said by for

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
capturing them or enemy's ships but you

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.280 
capturing them or enemy's ships but you
can<00:06:02.400> also<00:06:02.610> get<00:06:02.910> them<00:06:03.150> by<00:06:03.330> freeing<00:06:03.660> hostages

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:04.290 
can also get them by freeing hostages

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.290 
can also get them by freeing hostages
and<00:06:04.470> there<00:06:04.860> is<00:06:04.950> supposedly<00:06:05.280> more<00:06:05.670> ways<00:06:05.880> to<00:06:05.910> do

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
and there is supposedly more ways to do
