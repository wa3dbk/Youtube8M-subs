00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.300
 stands 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.810
 how come it was 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.810
 display 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.130
 medica 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.130
 these 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.400
 That's what we want with the train 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.140
 carpenter 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.180
 had to 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.180
 this person 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.570
 So I give you a little first 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.260
 briefing on things us truck driver 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.720
 start here with the 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.479
 dashboard that is at the lone star 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.040
 Of course, first classics 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.770
 like most us trucks but 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.540
 Nevertheless, smoking is a little bit more modern 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.770
 what I see here for example are the 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:18.430
 Show full as axel temperature 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:23.540
 engine oil temperature altitude pressure 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:25.580
 psps water temperature displayed here in 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.600
 Driving can be quite easy 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.990
 Convert 200 fahrenheit are about 90 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.220
 95 degrees, you have to expect that 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.220
 which I think is very nice 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.170
 this is real at the lone star 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.390
 Ergonomically shaped steering wheel has one 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.550
 nice beautiful structure nice leather 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.800
 you can touch well here as well 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.960
 on the steering wheel with multifunction switch 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.640
 Chen's what I find also very good 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.800
 All the other trucks have that too 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.800
 not this attitude is here 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.330
 because the steering wheel really like that to me 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.950
 Usually the tear can break 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.660
 Somehow like that with mummy I can do it though 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.560
 get so close to me 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.560
 the beautiful not 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.590
 I see 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.310
 then we are 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.680
 region 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.140
 them here 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.140
 this was 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.910
 I see 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.250
 so the gear is of course a great 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.100
 gear also made in the usa 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.780
 in this case, it is a thirteen gang 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:32.250
 means we have two different ones 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.930
 group nose down small group big 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.880
 group and then we have the big one 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.890
 group above we can split again 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.890
 responsible for this little red lever 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.360
 of course a lot of gossip on the factory 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.540
 is this a hole 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.000
 synchronized everyone's full feelings 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:59.079
 has the huge advantage around the two 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.079
 million kilometers 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.580
 game 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.200
 The lone star, of course, also powerful 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:18.040
 tried flavors again cheered here 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.859

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:24.540
