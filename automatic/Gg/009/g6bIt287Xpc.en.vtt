00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 why the earth and the moon are 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.309
 always face to face and well I you 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.920
 offers a little experience you 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.710
 take another person with you 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.809
 beds but in the hands face to face and 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.820
 you turn around you get 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.890
 a round what and you'll see that 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.400
 you always see the figure of the other 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.740
 nobody 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.600
 although you turn yourself by 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.490
 relative to the furniture makes you a round 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.900
 but compared to the other person you 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.949
 will see that you never see 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.869
 the back of his head 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.000
 it's a bit the same phenomenon while 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.820
 that the rotation of the earth and the 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.950
 moon are blocked precisely it takes 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.610
 they always look for 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.680
 their movement 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.899
 so what made his ba that did not 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.239
 not always been like that at the beginning of the 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.129
 earth the movements were 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.079
 independent and we could see the ip 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.660
 all phases of the moon 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.719
 and then gradually tightens tied to the 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.670
 marie this is one exercise started on 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.620
 the earth but the earth much more 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.750
 big that the moon exercises started 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.510
 much more powerful on the moon and 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.150
 it's married act as a brake that 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.340
 blocks the land that prevent it quebec 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.070
 the moon that it does not prevent from turning and 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.400
 that forces her to stand face to face with 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.580
 several other examples in the 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.250
 outer planets the satellites very 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.909
 often are in the blocked movements 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.210
 like that with irregularities whose 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:30.119
 regularity of the earth and the moon is 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.150
 besides this phenomenon of the tides and 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.380
 whoever blocks the earth and the moon 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:41.400
 in motion has the effect of 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:43.380
 moon is not moving away quickly a few 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.420
 centimeters a year but that's when 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.780
 even insufficient for that in a few 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.329
 millions of years the moon has become 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.170
 far enough so enough 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:57.719
 little seen here that it is no longer 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.079
 sun eclipse clip on sun 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:03.680
 exists because the diameter of the moon 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:08.039
 is pretty much exactly the same 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:10.110
 visual diameter of the moon view of so 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.590
 ie that the two discs that 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.860
 Great 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.239
 pose almost exactly not quite 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.810
 because we already have some 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.640
 periods 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:22.140
 according to the position of the moon we have 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:24.360
 the annular eclipse where the moon does 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.530
 not completely cover the sun at 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.349
 other periods of the cup 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.920
 completely in the past the moon was 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.019
 bigger 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.390
 because they were closer and 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.730
 then in a few million years and 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.739
 we could totally eclipse the sun 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.580
 so this is a benefit board in 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.580
 while it's time
