well he's lost two guys who he shouldn't

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:00.750 
well he's lost two guys who he shouldn't
have<00:00:58.809> for<00:00:58.989> example<00:00:59.050> Jason<00:01:00.010> Day<00:01:00.190> knocking<00:01:00.670> him

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
have for example Jason Day knocking him

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.459 
have for example Jason Day knocking him
out<00:01:00.879> was<00:01:01.120> very<00:01:01.570> shocking<00:01:01.899> that<00:01:02.170> should<00:01:02.350> have

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
out was very shocking that should have

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.499 
out was very shocking that should have
never<00:01:02.500> happened<00:01:02.829> Jason<00:01:03.579> today<00:01:03.969> is<00:01:04.030> basically

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:04.509 
never happened Jason today is basically

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:07.230 
never happened Jason today is basically
a<00:01:04.539> journey<00:01:04.809> man<00:01:05.080> never<00:01:05.530> blind<00:01:05.890> in<00:01:06.039> the<00:01:06.130> UFC<00:01:06.399> so

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
a journey man never blind in the UFC so

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.120 
a journey man never blind in the UFC so
both<00:01:07.420> guys<00:01:07.600> have<00:01:07.810> issues<00:01:08.110> with<00:01:08.229> flakiness<00:01:08.680> but

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
both guys have issues with flakiness but

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.070 
both guys have issues with flakiness but
I<00:01:09.310> think<00:01:09.970> that<00:01:10.090> kind<00:01:10.240> of<00:01:10.450> evens<00:01:10.750> each<00:01:10.869> other

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
I think that kind of evens each other

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.340 
I think that kind of evens each other
even<00:01:11.710> themselves<00:01:12.700> out<00:01:13.180> as<00:01:13.420> far<00:01:13.869> as<00:01:13.960> the<00:01:14.050> skills

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
even themselves out as far as the skills

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.050 
even themselves out as far as the skills
go<00:01:14.560> I<00:01:14.590> got<00:01:14.920> to<00:01:15.039> give<00:01:15.130> an<00:01:15.250> advantage<00:01:15.460> to<00:01:15.670> Vitor

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
go I got to give an advantage to Vitor

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.880 
go I got to give an advantage to Vitor
Belfort<00:01:16.090> here<00:01:16.570> he's<00:01:16.780> the<00:01:16.960> better<00:01:17.140> striker<00:01:17.619> in

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
Belfort here he's the better striker in

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.400 
Belfort here he's the better striker in
terms<00:01:18.130> of<00:01:18.369> boxing<00:01:19.000> speed<00:01:19.330> and<00:01:19.600> power<00:01:19.750> while

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
terms of boxing speed and power while

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.529 
terms of boxing speed and power while
Belcher<00:01:20.950> does<00:01:21.130> have<00:01:21.429> better<00:01:21.729> kicking<00:01:22.149> offense

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539 
Belcher does have better kicking offense

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:24.510 
Belcher does have better kicking offense
I<00:01:22.750> really<00:01:23.229> can't<00:01:23.259> see<00:01:23.590> Belcher<00:01:23.950> being<00:01:24.160> able<00:01:24.429> to

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
I really can't see Belcher being able to

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.400 
I really can't see Belcher being able to
sit<00:01:24.729> and<00:01:24.819> kick<00:01:25.000> Vitor<00:01:25.660> Belfort<00:01:25.690> in<00:01:26.110> the<00:01:26.200> legs

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
sit and kick Vitor Belfort in the legs

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.410 
sit and kick Vitor Belfort in the legs
in<00:01:26.619> the<00:01:26.709> body<00:01:26.890> for<00:01:27.190> three<00:01:27.429> rounds<00:01:27.610> getting<00:01:28.240> hit

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
with something huge and end up winning a

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.559 
with something huge and end up winning a
decision<00:01:30.250> I<00:01:30.399> don't<00:01:30.849> think<00:01:30.940> Alan<00:01:31.270> betch<00:01:31.390> was

00:01:31.559 --> 00:01:31.569 
decision I don't think Alan betch was

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:32.940 
decision I don't think Alan betch was
going<00:01:31.690> to<00:01:31.750> be<00:01:31.840> able<00:01:31.929> to<00:01:32.080> finish<00:01:32.229> Vitor<00:01:32.740> either

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
going to be able to finish Vitor either

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.580 
going to be able to finish Vitor either
and<00:01:33.280> for<00:01:33.729> Belcher<00:01:33.910> are<00:01:34.300> for<00:01:34.810> Vito<00:01:35.110> rather<00:01:35.319> I

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
and for Belcher are for Vito rather I

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:36.960 
and for Belcher are for Vito rather I
think<00:01:35.950> I<00:01:35.979> might<00:01:36.099> just<00:01:36.280> take<00:01:36.429> one<00:01:36.670> straight

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
think I might just take one straight

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.300 
think I might just take one straight
