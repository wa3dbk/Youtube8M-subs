 New Year holidays are long gone but 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.390
 I already missed the salad 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.369
 Olivier , the more I never once 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.110
 showed me how I cook it 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.629
 so today we will look at the recipe 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:41.129
 lettuce salad I went I'm sure that 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.120
 I will get a lot of response to this video 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.910
 comments 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.760
 something like a salad you are not so wrong 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.710
 proportions and not the ingredients i probably 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.170
 I agree with you in advance because 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.210
 Olivier everyone cooks as they consider 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.940
 fit and so for my love i take 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.879
 The following ingredients are 300 grams of beef 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.899
 two medium sized potatoes 1 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.700
 carrot 2 pickled cucumbers do not pay 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.820
 attention to what I planted props 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.320
 I still have 2 spare eggs small 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.280
 jar of green peas 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.250
 well onion salt and of course mayonnaise 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.650
 he is not a purchased me but a homemade recipe 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.119
 cooking mayonnaise I will show in 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.119
 one of the following programs 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.729
 first boil all boil and and 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.049
 Ingredients 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:40.789
 and this potato is carrot eggs and meat 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:43.009
 potatoes with carrots I will cook in 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:45.470
 one pot is cooked they will be somewhere 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.750
 30 minutes you will tell me that potatoes 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.640
 cooks faster carrots yes it 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.649
 really so but I have a small 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.399
 a piece of carrot so let them cook 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:54.399
 together 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.369
 in a separate saucepan need to boil eggs 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.429
 Put eggs in cold water 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:15.500
 and after boiling boil and somewhere 8-10 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:22.160
 minutes better 8 no 10 boil in general 9 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:23.510
 minutes after the eggs boiled them 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.849
 Must be put in the cold 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:31.250
 water so that later the shell was lighter 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:31.910
 clean your beef i will cook in 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.049
 steamer 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.269
 but you can boil the meat in the water the meat in 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:41.959
 water will cook for about an hour and a half 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:45.170
 and in a double boiler 40 minutes that's why I 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:48.069
 I use it only do not tell anyone 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.069
 it's a secret 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:03.390
 now the onion should be finely chopped and 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.610
 scald with boiling water and better soak in 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.150
 boiling water for about one minute then from 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.409
 Luke 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:13.370
 sharpness goes away but sweetness remains 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:13.370
 crisp and we need it 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:29.130
 when all the ingredients have fallen them 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.680
 on you of course cool before cutting 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.530
 as soon as they are cold we cut everything and 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.180
 mix I think that in a salad oliver 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.700
 size matters 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.310
 cut ingredients must be the same 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.100
 size and as a basis I always take size 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.800
 peas of about this size 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.870
 cut into cubes from carrot potatoes and 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:53.420
 meat from eggs cut into cubes 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.420
 problematic therefore they just crumble 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:37.250
 now left is mixing our ingredients 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.250
 fill in all the things with mayonnaise and eat 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:54.370
 there was a show with you 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.370
 until we meet again 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.270
 and
