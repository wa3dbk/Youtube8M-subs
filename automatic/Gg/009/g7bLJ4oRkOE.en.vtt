00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.890
 intermediate friends as they are I am 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.230
 luis kg and the time that a morning ago 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.520
 long but very very interesting has 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.440
 I really liked being here 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.820
 sharing with you the different 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.430
 gadgets and at this moment I want 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.590
 show them is the lumia 1020 that already 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.220
 we have talked on different occasions 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:27.160
 on a phone that has 41 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.199
 41 megapixel megapixels is huge or 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.300
 there are many cameras on a personal level 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.160
 they do not have the processor the size 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.500
 thickness that this phone has without 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.760
 But something that is very important is 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.250
 our friends we have not said 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.280
 hear you compare it with time you want with 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.320
 Koreans with apples with whom we 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.340
 that we want and the time we have done it 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.050
 and take very good pictures if we can say 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.050
 that at the moment is the phone 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:57.060
 smart that better pictures takes out 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:01:00.700
 but I think it takes a bit 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.710
 force it and show us what it is 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.170
 fact that's why we've taken a 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.810
 edition and we have bought check 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.490
 the photographic quality of this team of 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.920
 Monday 10 20 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.049
 enough of an opponent 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:19.240
 interesting at this time we are not going to 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:21.220
 check with the eos rebel sl 1 of canon 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.350
 this camera that the truth that we 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.720
 Impressed by how light it is and go 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.700
 to see obviously the functions are 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.460
 different and the equipment is used to 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.500
 these things but in the end the goal is 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.909
 the same take pictures in this case 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.340
 is a phone this case a camera 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.560
 made from right let's see what it takes out 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.979
 better pictures so stay with 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.979
 we 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.120
 It is very important that you know that 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.240
 both devices are in function 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.430
 automatic so that the work is not 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.040
 let's say it's not from me or in this case 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.620
 of the photographer without oxidizing the team both 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.420
 computers are all in automatic so 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.800
 in this way we will see the answer of 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.680
 the teams before the different 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.500
 situations we are going to take pictures of 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.320
 landscape and let's counter the 41 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.620
 megapixels by the 18 megapixels of the 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.620
 bed 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.160
 now let's take pictures but 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.420
 physically approaching the object that 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.420
 we want to photograph 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.280
 all right 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.800
 and well now let's try the 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.680
 zoom in on the equipment in 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.840
 this case is an 1855 lens and let's see 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.760
 how much can we approach with the 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.690
 zoom that in this case is digital from 'the 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.690
 one 1020 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.620
 davis 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.040
 and well now let's try what the 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.610
 Auto with images 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.610
 movement 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.849
 Well, very good friends, the time I eat 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.340
 well what our post producer said 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:20.709
 Ã©dgar guerrero the truth is that for the 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.220
 eye I have not trained the images of 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:26.019
 both teams looked practically 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:29.409
 same we have noticed difference where 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:32.760
 obviously there is much more quality in the 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:35.560
 canon sl one already in certain details 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.599
 approaching the approach again 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.750
 that we are seeing the portion of the 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:44.049
 image if it retains much more details 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.000
 there is more information more detail in the 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:49.510
 images produced through the canon 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.090
 and good we see certain detail in the 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.530
 images produced in the nokia lumia and 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:58.450
 it's 20 you have to remember that obviously 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.549
 a camera is a camera and a phone 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.549
 in the end although it has a very good 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.650
 camera is still a phone yes 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:09.609
 I still rely much more on the cameras 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:13.060
 but you have to give this honor to the nokia 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:16.060
 Lumia 10 20 that grants images very very 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.320
 So good so if we can 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.120
 say is yes 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.540
 you are fond of photography and 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.640
 are you looking for a team that has 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:27.550
 ideal features to take out 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:30.460
 images through it in this case if 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.590
 the Nokia Lumia 1020 would be a great 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.180
 alternative but good is that they are 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.250
 some comments you already saw the 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.560
 images you can write us leave us 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.930
 here your questions if you are for or in 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.700
 against when you are completely in your 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.610
 right we invite you to subscribe
