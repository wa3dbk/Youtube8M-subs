hole<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:56.039> happen<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.430> be<00:00:56.550> using<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:56.940> little

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
hole I happen to be using this little

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.420 
hole I happen to be using this little
bitty<00:00:57.420> thing<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.620> got<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.980> kind<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.160> cut<00:00:59.370> them

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
bitty thing so I got to kind of cut them

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.650 
bitty thing so I got to kind of cut them
up<00:00:59.640> now<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.809> don't<00:01:01.199> want<00:01:01.590> all<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.160> stems<00:01:02.660> or

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
up now I don't want all of the stems or

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.390 
up now I don't want all of the stems or
this<00:01:03.840> all<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.350> seeds<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:04.890> think<00:01:05.189> it's<00:01:05.309> just

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
this all of the seeds I think it's just

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.640 
this all of the seeds I think it's just
a<00:01:05.549> prettier<00:01:05.909> sauce<00:01:06.240> without<00:01:06.570> all<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.110> seeds

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
a prettier sauce without all the seeds

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.090 
a prettier sauce without all the seeds
now<00:01:08.460> most<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.630> fire<00:01:09.990> from<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.500> pepper<00:01:10.770> is

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
now most of the fire from the pepper is

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.640 
now most of the fire from the pepper is
contained<00:01:12.090> in<00:01:12.270> these<00:01:12.420> ribs<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:13.439> if<00:01:13.530> you're

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
contained in these ribs so if you're

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.289 
contained in these ribs so if you're
worried<00:01:13.950> about<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.640> can<00:01:14.790> cut<00:01:14.970> some<00:01:15.180> of

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
worried about that you can cut some of

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.030 
worried about that you can cut some of
that<00:01:15.330> out<00:01:15.890> anyway

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
that out anyway

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.620 
that out anyway
I'm<00:01:17.130> going<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.369> chop<00:01:17.670> these<00:01:17.880> up<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.450> have

you<00:01:34.110> don't<00:01:34.290> necessarily<00:01:34.439> have<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.570> roughly

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
you don't necessarily have to roughly

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.230 
you don't necessarily have to roughly
chop<00:01:36.630> them<00:01:37.140> ahead<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.320> time<00:01:37.590> but<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:38.130> like<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.060> do

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
chop them ahead of time but I like to do

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.060 
chop them ahead of time but I like to do
that<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.840> make<00:01:39.990> sure<00:01:40.140> they<00:01:40.259> kind<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.590> chop<00:01:40.799> up

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
that to make sure they kind of chop up

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.069 
that to make sure they kind of chop up
or<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.460> can<00:01:41.610> smash<00:01:42.060> them<00:01:42.329> whatever<00:01:43.020> you

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
or you can smash them whatever you

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:43.789 
or you can smash them whatever you
wanted<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.380> do

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
wanted to do

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:50.560 
wanted to do
and<00:01:44.700> then<00:01:44.820> we're<00:01:44.939> going<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.119> blend<00:01:45.299> this<00:01:45.450> up

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570

lightly cover it with some plastic wrap
or<00:04:36.850> something<00:04:37.240> but<00:04:38.110> it<00:04:38.230> needs<00:04:38.410> to<00:04:38.560> set<00:04:38.830> and

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
or something but it needs to set and

or something but it needs to set and
firm<00:04:39.340> it<00:04:39.550> and<00:04:39.700> the<00:04:40.000> reason<00:04:40.330> for<00:04:40.360> that<00:04:40.540> is<00:04:40.930> it

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
firm it and the reason for that is it

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.160

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
now you're going to get a big shot of

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.290 
now you're going to get a big shot of
vinegar<00:04:48.310> and<00:04:48.760> spice<00:04:49.090> not<00:04:49.930> exactly<00:04:50.350> Pleasant

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
but if you wait three days you'll get

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
and think it seems to thicken up a

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.770 
and think it seems to thicken up a
little<00:04:59.740> bit<00:04:59.950> and<00:05:00.220> it<00:05:00.820> mellows<00:05:01.180> out<00:05:01.390> it's

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780
