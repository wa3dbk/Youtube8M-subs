tiny iPad in landscape mode also that
longer<00:01:04.439> battery<00:01:04.739> life<00:01:04.949> but<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.030> bigger<00:01:06.210> size

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
longer battery life but the bigger size

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.630 
longer battery life but the bigger size
can<00:01:06.840> make<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.140> harder<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.500> use<00:01:07.799> one<00:01:08.040> handed<00:01:08.520> for

optically<00:01:40.890> aligning<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.640> LCD<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.450> get

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
optically aligning the LCD so you get

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.539 
optically aligning the LCD so you get
even<00:01:42.689> bigger<00:01:43.140> viewing<00:01:43.619> angles<00:01:43.979> even<00:01:44.310> better

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
even bigger viewing angles even better

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.429 
even bigger viewing angles even better
contrast<00:01:45.210> they're<00:01:45.780> also<00:01:45.960> using<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.320> new

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
contrast they're also using a new

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.319 
contrast they're also using a new
polarizer<00:01:47.009> so<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.520> works<00:01:47.640> much<00:01:48.060> better

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
polarizer so that it works much better

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.480

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
you finish you now have a new timer mode

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.390 
you finish you now have a new timer mode
so<00:03:42.840> you<00:03:42.900> tap<00:03:43.140> the<00:03:43.260> timer<00:03:43.470> button<00:03:43.770> you<00:03:44.100> tell<00:03:44.310> it

so you tap the timer button you tell it

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.770 
so you tap the timer button you tell it
how<00:03:44.550> long<00:03:44.760> you<00:03:44.910> want<00:03:45.030> to<00:03:45.090> do<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.239> timer<00:03:45.450> for

cameras on the back they are identical

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.010 
cameras on the back they are identical
in<00:04:05.280> every<00:04:05.430> way<00:04:05.820> except<00:04:06.209> the<00:04:06.270> iPhone<00:04:06.570> 6<00:04:06.840> plus

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
in every way except the iPhone 6 plus

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.320 
in every way except the iPhone 6 plus
has<00:04:07.350> optical<00:04:07.800> image<00:04:08.010> stabilization<00:04:08.550> that

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
has optical image stabilization that

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.690 
has optical image stabilization that
means<00:04:09.510> the<00:04:09.750> lens<00:04:10.050> actually<00:04:10.380> floats<00:04:11.340> to<00:04:11.520> keep

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
means the lens actually floats to keep

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.040 
means the lens actually floats to keep
it<00:04:11.820> stable<00:04:12.120> right<00:04:12.239> now<00:04:12.360> you<00:04:12.450> can<00:04:12.570> see<00:04:12.690> my<00:04:12.810> hands

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
it stable right now you can see my hands

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.900 
it stable right now you can see my hands
are<00:04:13.140> shaking<00:04:13.470> a<00:04:13.530> little<00:04:13.650> bit<00:04:13.770> and<00:04:14.040> that<00:04:14.670> means

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
are shaking a little bit and that means

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.310 
are shaking a little bit and that means
that<00:04:15.030> it<00:04:15.150> can't<00:04:15.390> keep<00:04:15.510> the<00:04:15.660> aperture<00:04:16.049> open

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
that it can't keep the aperture open

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.509 
that it can't keep the aperture open
long<00:04:16.500> and<00:04:16.650> which<00:04:16.739> means<00:04:16.859> it<00:04:16.950> can't<00:04:17.160> get<00:04:17.340> a<00:04:17.370> lot

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
long and which means it can't get a lot

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.460 
long and which means it can't get a lot
of<00:04:17.640> light<00:04:17.820> in<00:04:17.970> because<00:04:18.690> this<00:04:18.930> camera<00:04:19.229> is

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
of light in because this camera is

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.469 
of light in because this camera is
optically<00:04:19.919> image<00:04:20.190> stabilized<00:04:20.790> it<00:04:21.060> can<00:04:21.209> hold

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
optically image stabilized it can hold

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.450 
optically image stabilized it can hold
that<00:04:21.750> aperture<00:04:22.049> open<00:04:22.440> for<00:04:22.590> much<00:04:22.800> longer<00:04:23.220> that

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
that aperture open for much longer that

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.159 
that aperture open for much longer that
means<00:04:23.700> less<00:04:23.970> noise<00:04:24.000> it's<00:04:24.930> going<00:04:25.050> to<00:04:25.110> be

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
means less noise it's going to be

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.080 
means less noise it's going to be
impossible<00:04:25.440> to<00:04:25.830> see<00:04:25.950> on<00:04:26.070> the<00:04:26.190> video<00:04:26.310> but<00:04:26.729> when

impossible to see on the video but when

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.460 
impossible to see on the video but when

you do take low-light pictures with the
iPhone<00:04:28.770> 6<00:04:29.010> plus<00:04:29.100> you'll<00:04:29.610> see<00:04:29.850> less<00:04:30.090> grain<00:04:30.419> in

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
iPhone 6 plus you'll see less grain in

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.000 
iPhone 6 plus you'll see less grain in
it<00:04:30.630> it'll<00:04:30.930> look<00:04:31.050> smoother<00:04:31.620> to<00:04:31.770> your<00:04:31.890> eyes

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
it it'll look smoother to your eyes
