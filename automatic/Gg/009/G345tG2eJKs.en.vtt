would lay it down and show you but the
iphone<00:00:13.170> actually<00:00:13.620> fits<00:00:13.889> about<00:00:14.040> this<00:00:14.460> width

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
iphone actually fits about this width

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.570 
iphone actually fits about this width
here<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:16.199> actually<00:00:16.350> is<00:00:16.740> about<00:00:16.949> this<00:00:17.220> this

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
here and actually is about this this

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.670 
here and actually is about this this
long<00:00:17.910> so<00:00:18.539> it's<00:00:18.750> actually<00:00:18.869> pretty<00:00:19.170> pretty

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
long so it's actually pretty pretty

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.519 
long so it's actually pretty pretty
comparable<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.310> an<00:00:20.430> iphone<00:00:20.550> in<00:00:20.939> size<00:00:21.380> I'm<00:00:22.380> not

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
unfortunately it's going to be kind of

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.020 
unfortunately it's going to be kind of
hard<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.470> tell<00:00:31.560> but<00:00:32.390> I<00:00:33.390> am<00:00:33.600> able<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.670> do<00:00:35.670> stuff

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
hard to tell but I am able to do stuff

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.080 
hard to tell but I am able to do stuff
such<00:00:36.270> as<00:00:36.480> if<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.750> were<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:36.960> do<00:00:37.399> the<00:00:38.399> function<00:00:38.879> key

and ctrl delete for example that would

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.619 
and ctrl delete for example that would
send<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.180> signal<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.960> computer<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.890> do<00:00:47.039> a
