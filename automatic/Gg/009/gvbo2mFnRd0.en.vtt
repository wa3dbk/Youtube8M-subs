00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.650
 let's see how stability control works and how it is capable of 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.799
 help us in an ignacio emergency situation 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:16.160
 I have we are going to take advantage of this dangerous maneuver caused by the fall of a 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.849
 part of the load of a truck 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:20.759
 to better understand how stability control works 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:25.059
 bm the abrupt lane change to dodge the obstacle breaks down by 

00:00:25.059 --> 00:00:27.230
 complete the stability of the euro 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.880
 and without st help 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.880
 the thing would not end with a happy ending ain 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.380
 then 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.950
 the mee stability control uses part of the neighbor's elements 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.360
 india adds some more that are what it helps you to help us 1 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.060
 a sensor located in the center of the chassis miguel car turn angle 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.150
 on its vertical axis min that angle must correspond to the rotation of the 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.360
 flyer as much in intensity writing from a certain 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.750
 deviation value the control unit sends a signal of a 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.830
 hydraulic device kapanga 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.670
 Bring the brakes of each wheel independently even when the 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.790
 address that the vehicle takes does not correspond with the one it tells the 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.299
 Steering wheel system operates by braking the power wheel 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.420
 what causes an effect similar to that of the chains of a tank 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.799
 and help that car and the trajectory indicated by the steering wheel 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.900
 the effect is twofold when basing his performance on the brakes the first thing that 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.110
 occurs is a decrease in speed 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.150
 circumstance that facilitates the adherence of tires 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.660
 In addition, inducing an additional turn with the wheels does not direct a debit that 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.790
 occur pendulum defects that would cause strong load changes and 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.330
 that would end up ruining the stability which would end us 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.330
 losing control of the vehicle min 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.030
 drÃ¡ 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.680
 not in summary with him 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.050
 We just have to concentrate on pointing the steering wheel towards where 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.050
 we want to go and let the rest accept it 

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:18.249
 I come the st always help 

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:21.529
 but his performance is especially effective the abrupt changes of 

00:02:21.529 --> 00:02:24.570
 trajectory with loss of attention as in this case 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.000
 in the club is appropriate timely breaks the violence of the 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.049
 tires and we just get off the road 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.030
 MMM 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.830
 as we see from the performance of the spd in this case avoids the slip and we 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.550
 lets keep control of the situation let's see what they do
