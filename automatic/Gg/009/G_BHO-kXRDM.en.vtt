00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:22.289
 cash game games in the world thomas 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.289

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.480
 a returner there 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.480
 comeback by robert 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.980
 he's got a decent - 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.520
 Fought back up from the 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.240
 Switzerland 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.240
 beeskow has 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:02.240
 around the young wild sony wants and 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.450
 all yes that I do not go on good 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.450
 ways 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.509
 well it could be a little bit better 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:10.670
 horst army will be very entertaining 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.930
 presentation of them but also 6000 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.080
 euro in the minus 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:19.209
 currently in plus jonas kronwitter new 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.209
 and Thomas wisch 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:31.060
 as an expert, there was a new round 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:35.140
 new luck, well, there's one again 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:38.440
 bag about the well pleased 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:44.740
 the robert eg also to a german 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:47.860
 homeland history still unspotted 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:51.250
 are in the area gentile but a well 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.200
 very very strong cash games will remain 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:58.800
 it also with the tournament poker good with it 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:06.310
 made at the wpt in austria place 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:08.130
 the picasso happens then a complete one 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:16.930
 picture still to get 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:20.230
 the raise of jonas increases thomas gold 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:26.020
 the 300 jonas makes 1115 brutal 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:28.750
 not good enough to keep playing 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.550
 because of two potential opponents she 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.270
 Five was over for a good price 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.270
 to block a cent 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:43.239
 10 of course we have a good flop like that 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.380
 you like to get into a high roller 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.739
 round 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.989
 in addition to jonas a flop not 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:53.700
 so bad of the supreme that is we 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:56.290
 that finally money goes in here 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.420
 what Thomas may not know 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.040
 that this cat is standing in front of him and the 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.220
 spectators follow the last ones 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:07.570
 know that this money is a waving it 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:09.580
 I easily curse what's up there 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:13.320
 because with whom she always stood the 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.320
 slipped fed into minus 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.850
 now what I mean in french 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.470
 but I believe without the 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.320
 tell story of this cat 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.270
 do not want to be left behind 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.570
 It was always careful that you did not 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.590
 The cat in the bag buys there you have to 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.370
 be careful 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.710
 ohu pretty much left the field behind 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.660
 he lends you though I believe there are 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:50.610
 just a stone's throw away 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:53.470
 had a dream in thomas thomas the show 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:05:00.610
 an opponent who pays himself 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:05:02.560
 a full perhaps could also 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.050
 be the last money which young 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:08.530
 have invested for the flight to piste 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.700
 the heart 6 the board in the case too 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:15.540
 a little bit more dangerous 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:23.080
 third heart endangers the portal 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:27.070
 possibilities times the main customers for 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:29.020
 the hand of jonas and something like ne 876 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.780
 he's ahead of the flop and a lot of it 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.360
 are now past him sixth 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.760
 and eighth 1997 might still be 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.890
 pay here 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:41.830
 but that's not so many bottles it 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:45.970
 also arrived on the turn so plays 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:48.670
 He prefers careful and checks with 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:52.390
 maybe a bed too 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:54.870
 if they are not too big 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.870
 fails 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:12.690
 15,000 started again 20 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:12.690
 total of course lose before 18 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:25.230
 jonas does not hit as a half pot 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:28.410
 more all too much except maybe that 

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:29.820
 they are now not after they check 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:31.850
 hand in a plus but transform that 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:38.100
 would be a bit unusual 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:45.660
 already arrived very much looks easy 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:47.670
 overcards with very little end there 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:51.540
 just take exactly the scenes there 

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:53.130
 jonas has really hit so far 

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:56.400
 even if it is at first glance 

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:58.230
 maybe most of them are difficult 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:05.100
 on the second look a bit 

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:09.080
 easier folk so you imagine that 

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:14.820
 debut before welcome 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:18.450
 as already that means the first look 

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:20.880
 on plusminus should and can have 

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:26.360
 Let him see the state of things for him 

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:26.360
 after the first hand more ok
