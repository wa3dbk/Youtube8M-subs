00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
600 the 700 and 800 I think set in the

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.610 
600 the 700 and 800 I think set in the
kind<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.239> reserve<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.750> top<00:00:39.930> three<00:00:40.320> advance

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
kind of reserve the top three advance

tone of stages of violins and price wise
the<00:00:45.059> CBN<00:00:45.480> 600<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.879> $400

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
the CBN 600 is $400

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.830 
the CBN 600 is $400
this<00:00:48.510> one<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:49.430> $1200<00:00:50.430> so<00:00:50.579> it's<00:00:50.730> three<00:00:51.120> times<00:00:51.449> as

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
this one is $1200 so it's three times as

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.590 
this one is $1200 so it's three times as
much<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:53.160> prices<00:00:53.550> are<00:00:53.670> approximate<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.449> does

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
much the prices are approximate it does

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.299 
much the prices are approximate it does
depend<00:00:54.930> on<00:00:55.050> on<00:00:55.260> what<00:00:55.379> they<00:00:55.500> are<00:00:55.620> outlined<00:00:56.250> I

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
depend on on what they are outlined I

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.500 
depend on on what they are outlined I
was<00:00:56.430> in<00:00:56.550> common<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:56.940> time<00:00:57.090> but<00:00:57.210> let's<00:00:57.360> say

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
was in common the time but let's say

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.360 
was in common the time but let's say
four<00:00:57.719> hundred<00:00:57.750> twelve<00:00:58.350> hundred<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:59.190> this

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
four hundred twelve hundred so this

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.180 
four hundred twelve hundred so this
one's<00:00:59.550> three<00:00:59.640> times<00:01:00.270> as<00:01:00.449> much<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.859> think

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
one's three times as much so I think

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.729 
one's three times as much so I think
before<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.640> go<00:01:03.210> into<00:01:03.420> any<00:01:03.960> type<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.229> detail<00:01:04.650> on

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
before I go into any type of detail on

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.620 
before I go into any type of detail on
everything<00:01:04.949> if<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.460> play<00:01:05.790> them<00:01:06.000> back<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.420> back

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
everything if I play them back to back

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.280 
everything if I play them back to back
so<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.320> can<00:01:07.619> hear<00:01:08.340> what<00:01:08.490> they<00:01:08.610> sound<00:01:08.820> like<00:01:09.290> and

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
so you can hear what they sound like and

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.530 
so you can hear what they sound like and
then<00:01:10.530> I'll<00:01:11.280> go<00:01:11.490> through<00:01:11.520> my<00:01:11.880> thoughts<00:01:12.210> and

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
then I'll go through my thoughts and

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.480 
then I'll go through my thoughts and
back<00:01:13.320> some<00:01:13.500> figures<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:14.010> kind<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.280> thing

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
back some figures and that kind of thing

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.820 
back some figures and that kind of thing
and<00:01:14.840> yeah<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.049> then<00:01:16.170> give<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.409> summary<00:01:16.680> of

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
and yeah and then give you a summary of

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.340 
and yeah and then give you a summary of
what<00:01:17.280> my<00:01:17.610> think<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.390> I'm<00:01:18.869> gonna<00:01:18.990> start<00:01:19.229> by

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
what my think so I'm gonna start by

00:01:19.350 --> 00:02:30.000 
what my think so I'm gonna start by
playing<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.680> 600<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.460> then<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:21.000> 800

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.290 

so<00:02:31.010> why<00:02:31.130> do<00:02:31.190> you<00:02:31.250> think<00:02:31.430> there<00:02:31.640> isn't<00:02:31.940> a<00:02:32.060> doubt

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
so why do you think there isn't a doubt

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.440 
so why do you think there isn't a doubt
that<00:02:32.360> the<00:02:33.230> that<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:33.740> 800<00:02:34.460> is<00:02:34.760> a<00:02:35.000> lot<00:02:35.270> better

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
that the that the 800 is a lot better

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.110 
that the that the 800 is a lot better
than<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:36.110> 600<00:02:37.010> again<00:02:37.310> I<00:02:37.340> don't<00:02:37.700> know<00:02:37.850> how<00:02:37.970> much

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
than the 600 again I don't know how much

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.670 
than the 600 again I don't know how much
the<00:02:38.300> camera<00:02:38.450> has<00:02:38.780> picked<00:02:39.020> up<00:02:39.140> on<00:02:39.290> that<00:02:39.470> but

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
the camera has picked up on that but

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.140 
the camera has picked up on that but
what<00:02:39.830> I'm<00:02:39.980> hearing<00:02:40.310> in<00:02:40.490> the<00:02:40.580> room<00:02:40.760> is<00:02:40.910> that<00:02:41.060> the

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
what I'm hearing in the room is that the

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.780 
what I'm hearing in the room is that the
800<00:02:41.870> is<00:02:42.050> a<00:02:42.650> little<00:02:42.950> bit<00:02:43.070> more<00:02:43.190> sophisticated

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
800 is a little bit more sophisticated

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.340 
800 is a little bit more sophisticated
or<00:02:43.910> quite<00:02:44.210> a<00:02:44.300> bit<00:02:44.450> more<00:02:44.540> sophisticated<00:02:45.170> than

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
or quite a bit more sophisticated than

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.310 
or quite a bit more sophisticated than
the<00:02:45.530> 600<00:02:46.780> unfortunately<00:02:47.780> I<00:02:47.810> think<00:02:47.900> that<00:02:48.230> the

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
the 600 unfortunately I think that the

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.290 
the 600 unfortunately I think that the
800<00:02:48.890> just<00:02:49.100> hasn't<00:02:49.310> been<00:02:49.460> broken<00:02:49.880> in<00:02:50.000> you<00:02:50.210> it

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
800 just hasn't been broken in you it

destiel bridge it's a French bridge by
the<00:03:22.940> looks<00:03:23.120> of<00:03:23.240> it<00:03:23.390> I'm<00:03:23.750> sorry<00:03:23.990> if<00:03:24.080> my

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
the looks of it I'm sorry if my

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.460 
the looks of it I'm sorry if my
pronunciation<00:03:24.920> is<00:03:24.980> a<00:03:25.040> bit<00:03:25.220> rubbish<00:03:25.490> there<00:03:26.470> but

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
pronunciation is a bit rubbish there but

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:28.990 
pronunciation is a bit rubbish there but
yeah<00:03:27.650> this<00:03:27.860> is<00:03:27.920> so<00:03:28.220> this<00:03:28.340> hasn't<00:03:28.550> warmed<00:03:28.820> up

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
yeah this is so this hasn't warmed up

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.210 
yeah this is so this hasn't warmed up
yet<00:03:29.210> so<00:03:29.290> ideally<00:03:30.290> you<00:03:30.470> know<00:03:30.560> I'd<00:03:30.710> have<00:03:31.010> this

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
yet so ideally you know I'd have this

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.340 
yet so ideally you know I'd have this
first<00:03:31.460> six<00:03:31.820> to<00:03:31.940> nine<00:03:32.090> months<00:03:32.510> and<00:03:32.690> warm<00:03:33.200> it<00:03:33.320> up

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
first six to nine months and warm it up

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:34.780 
first six to nine months and warm it up
with<00:03:33.440> all<00:03:33.680> the<00:03:33.770> undertones<00:03:34.190> overtones<00:03:34.700> and

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
with all the undertones overtones and

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.730 
with all the undertones overtones and
harmonics<00:03:35.300> and<00:03:35.450> things<00:03:35.690> and<00:03:35.990> make<00:03:36.470> it<00:03:36.620> sound

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
harmonics and things and make it sound

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.350 
harmonics and things and make it sound
really<00:03:37.010> nice<00:03:37.250> and<00:03:37.640> then<00:03:37.850> I<00:03:37.880> could<00:03:38.090> give<00:03:38.209> you<00:03:38.240> a

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
really nice and then I could give you a

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.180 
really nice and then I could give you a
review<00:03:38.570> but<00:03:38.959> I<00:03:39.170> mean<00:03:39.470> that<00:03:39.560> would<00:03:39.680> be<00:03:39.740> an<00:03:39.890> ideal

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
review but I mean that would be an ideal

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.040 
review but I mean that would be an ideal
world<00:03:40.400> wouldn't<00:03:40.820> it<00:03:40.880> and<00:03:41.060> you<00:03:41.750> know<00:03:41.870> I<00:03:41.900> just

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
world wouldn't it and you know I just

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.720 
world wouldn't it and you know I just
that<00:03:42.680> would<00:03:42.800> just<00:03:42.950> be<00:03:43.010> impossible<00:03:43.250> for<00:03:43.490> me<00:03:43.640> to

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
that would just be impossible for me to

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.290 
that would just be impossible for me to
do<00:03:43.970> so<00:03:44.720> they're<00:03:45.590> both<00:03:45.950> kind<00:03:46.370> of<00:03:46.520> very<00:03:47.060> cold

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
do so they're both kind of very cold

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.600 
do so they're both kind of very cold
violins<00:03:47.840> if<00:03:47.959> you<00:03:48.080> like<00:03:48.260> so<00:03:48.560> it's<00:03:48.740> it's<00:03:49.220> it's

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
violins if you like so it's it's it's

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.510 
violins if you like so it's it's it's
still<00:03:49.760> kind<00:03:50.060> of<00:03:50.090> a<00:03:50.180> true<00:03:50.360> test<00:03:50.390> to<00:03:50.750> each<00:03:50.870> other

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
still kind of a true test to each other

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.220 
still kind of a true test to each other
so<00:03:52.520> for<00:03:52.850> what<00:03:53.000> I'm<00:03:53.120> hearing<00:03:53.420> in<00:03:53.510> the<00:03:53.570> room<00:03:53.810> the

so for what I'm hearing in the room the
600<00:03:54.920> dots<00:03:55.070> are<00:03:55.310> very<00:03:55.520> nice<00:03:55.730> and<00:03:56.000> it<00:03:56.060> does<00:03:56.180> feel

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
600 dots are very nice and it does feel

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.600 
600 dots are very nice and it does feel
and<00:03:56.690> it<00:03:56.750> does<00:03:56.840> play<00:03:57.080> very<00:03:57.320> nice<00:03:57.470> the<00:03:57.680> 800<00:03:58.220> also

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
and it does play very nice the 800 also

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.550 
and it does play very nice the 800 also
sounds<00:03:58.910> very<00:03:58.940> nice<00:03:59.209> and<00:03:59.480> it<00:03:59.570> feels<00:03:59.810> and<00:04:00.260> plays

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
sounds very nice and it feels and plays

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
think in pretty much in a blind test

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.680 
think in pretty much in a blind test
they<00:04:07.940> the<00:04:08.840> wood<00:04:09.080> looks<00:04:09.320> pretty<00:04:09.770> much<00:04:10.190> the<00:04:10.690> same

well because I use two pegs to to
nopprage<00:04:29.440> you<00:04:29.979> can<00:04:30.160> use<00:04:30.370> the<00:04:30.490> pegs<00:04:30.729> on<00:04:30.880> the

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
nopprage you can use the pegs on the

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.159 
nopprage you can use the pegs on the
either<00:04:31.060> of<00:04:31.210> these<00:04:31.389> for<00:04:31.690> some<00:04:31.750> active<00:04:32.050> but

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
either of these for some active but

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:33.330 
either of these for some active but
traditionally<00:04:32.710> for<00:04:32.979> this<00:04:33.070> kind<00:04:33.280> of

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
traditionally for this kind of

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.370 
traditionally for this kind of
instrument<00:04:33.639> at<00:04:33.970> this<00:04:34.150> level<00:04:34.360> you<00:04:34.900> would<00:04:35.110> use

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
instrument at this level you would use

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.620 
instrument at this level you would use
the<00:04:35.530> pegs<00:04:35.740> to<00:04:35.860> tune<00:04:36.100> up<00:04:36.280> you<00:04:36.460> just<00:04:36.669> get<00:04:36.820> a<00:04:36.850> much

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
the pegs to tune up you just get a much

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.990 
the pegs to tune up you just get a much
more<00:04:37.660> accurate<00:04:37.990> tune<00:04:38.770> I<00:04:39.010> think<00:04:39.370> that<00:04:39.610> the<00:04:39.790> fine

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
more accurate tune I think that the fine

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.330 
more accurate tune I think that the fine
tune<00:04:40.300> that<00:04:40.449> the<00:04:40.540> fine<00:04:40.720> tuners<00:04:41.080> can<00:04:41.260> be<00:04:41.410> almost

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
tune that the fine tuners can be almost

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.730 
tune that the fine tuners can be almost
a<00:04:42.370> little<00:04:42.490> bit<00:04:42.550> too<00:04:42.639> fine<00:04:43.419> by<00:04:44.199> night<00:04:44.410> if<00:04:44.620> you

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
a little bit too fine by night if you

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.800 
a little bit too fine by night if you
like<00:04:45.389> there<00:04:46.389> anyway<00:04:46.570> so<00:04:47.290> I<00:04:47.740> think<00:04:48.550> I<00:04:49.120> do<00:04:49.479> like

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
like there anyway so I think I do like

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.320 
like there anyway so I think I do like
them<00:04:49.960> both<00:04:50.169> getting<00:04:51.160> right<00:04:51.430> to<00:04:51.460> cutting<00:04:52.210> right

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
them both getting right to cutting right

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.150 
them both getting right to cutting right
to<00:04:52.389> the<00:04:52.570> chase<00:04:52.660> go<00:04:53.260> to<00:04:53.320> the<00:04:53.530> bottom<00:04:53.740> line<00:04:53.950> I

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
to the chase go to the bottom line I

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.129 
to the chase go to the bottom line I
think<00:04:54.550> with<00:04:55.270> price<00:04:55.570> range

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139 
think with price range

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:02.070 
think with price range
I<00:04:57.630> think<00:04:58.630> the<00:04:58.720> 600<00:04:59.260> is<00:04:59.350> really<00:04:59.919> good<00:05:00.190> at<00:05:00.840> $400<00:05:01.840> I

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
I think the 600 is really good at $400 I

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.790 
I think the 600 is really good at $400 I
also<00:05:02.830> think<00:05:03.190> the<00:05:03.250> 800<00:05:03.820> is<00:05:03.910> really<00:05:04.419> good<00:05:04.630> at

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
also think the 800 is really good at

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.680 
also think the 800 is really good at
$1200<00:05:05.800> buy<00:05:06.070> if<00:05:06.220> I<00:05:06.370> was<00:05:06.550> going<00:05:06.850> here<00:05:07.360> Leon

$1200 buy if I was going here Leon
Christ<00:05:08.440> unknown<00:05:09.130> I<00:05:09.520> would<00:05:10.300> go<00:05:10.479> for<00:05:10.900> the<00:05:11.110> CD<00:05:11.650> and

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.640 
Christ unknown I would go for the CD and
600<00:05:12.520> because<00:05:12.760> I<00:05:12.850> think<00:05:12.910> for<00:05:13.180> $400<00:05:13.960> I<00:05:14.110> think<00:05:14.440> you

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
600 because I think for $400 I think you

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.890 
600 because I think for $400 I think you

top of your career

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.420 
top of your career
it's<00:05:19.539> neither<00:05:20.080> these<00:05:20.470> are<00:05:20.680> professional

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
it's neither these are professional

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.909 
it's neither these are professional
grade<00:05:21.729> instruments<00:05:22.419> and<00:05:22.720> they<00:05:23.050> are<00:05:23.229> they<00:05:23.740> are

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919

they are professional and instruments

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.360 
they are professional and instruments
but<00:05:26.050> you<00:05:26.530> know<00:05:26.620> they're<00:05:26.770> not<00:05:26.860> something<00:05:27.100> that

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
but you know they're not something that

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.279 
but you know they're not something that
kind<00:05:27.610> of<00:05:27.700> someone<00:05:28.120> whose<00:05:28.330> solo<00:05:28.750> touring<00:05:29.139> in<00:05:29.200> an

orchestra at the top of their that
profession<00:05:31.690> would<00:05:31.840> would<00:05:32.200> use<00:05:32.470> and<00:05:33.280> I<00:05:33.370> think

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
profession would would use and I think

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.730 
profession would would use and I think
even<00:05:33.639> Cecilia<00:05:34.300> would<00:05:34.479> even<00:05:34.720> admit<00:05:35.020> that<00:05:35.050> but

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
even Cecilia would even admit that but

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.730 
even Cecilia would even admit that but
they<00:05:35.860> are<00:05:36.070> definitely<00:05:36.479> professional

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
they are definitely professional

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.379 
they are definitely professional
entering<00:05:38.740> professional<00:05:39.340> level<00:05:39.639> instruments

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:40.389 
entering professional level instruments

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:43.500 
entering professional level instruments
as<00:05:41.169> the<00:05:41.410> 800<00:05:41.950> obviously<00:05:42.250> Morse<00:05:42.460> over<00:05:42.789> the<00:05:42.880> 600

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:43.510 
as the 800 obviously Morse over the 600

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.600 
as the 800 obviously Morse over the 600
if<00:05:44.320> it<00:05:44.470> was<00:05:44.560> going<00:05:44.710> like<00:05:44.830> purely<00:05:45.340> down<00:05:45.490> to

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.610 
if it was going like purely down to

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.820 
if it was going like purely down to
price<00:05:45.849> like<00:05:46.060> I<00:05:46.210> said<00:05:46.419> I<00:05:46.630> think<00:05:47.020> the<00:05:47.110> 600<00:05:47.680> I

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
price like I said I think the 600 I

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.490 
price like I said I think the 600 I
would<00:05:48.010> get<00:05:48.160> the<00:05:48.220> 600<00:05:48.760> over<00:05:49.060> the<00:05:49.180> 800<00:05:49.810> but<00:05:50.320> the

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
would get the 600 over the 800 but the

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.219 
would get the 600 over the 800 but the
800<00:05:51.039> I<00:05:51.130> think<00:05:51.400> will<00:05:51.610> warm<00:05:51.970> into<00:05:52.270> a<00:05:52.570> much<00:05:52.960> nicer

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:53.229 
800 I think will warm into a much nicer

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:55.110 
800 I think will warm into a much nicer
instrument<00:05:53.950> unfortunately<00:05:54.760> I<00:05:54.820> don't<00:05:54.880> know

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 
instrument unfortunately I don't know

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.490 
instrument unfortunately I don't know
what<00:05:55.270> that<00:05:55.389> is<00:05:55.419> yet<00:05:55.810> because<00:05:56.200> I<00:05:56.229> haven't

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
what that is yet because I haven't

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.379 
what that is yet because I haven't
played<00:05:57.039> it<00:05:57.250> I<00:05:57.400> wouldn't<00:05:57.729> know<00:05:57.849> that<00:05:57.880> unless<00:05:58.060> I

00:05:58.379 --> 00:05:58.389 
played it I wouldn't know that unless I

00:05:58.389 --> 00:05:59.460 
played it I wouldn't know that unless I
was<00:05:58.479> trying<00:05:58.690> it<00:05:58.870> for

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.470 
was trying it for

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.230 
was trying it for
Monsoor<00:05:59.920> gave<00:06:00.100> it<00:06:00.220> to<00:06:00.310> someone<00:06:00.490> to<00:06:00.820> warm<00:06:01.150> up

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
Monsoor gave it to someone to warm up

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.150 
Monsoor gave it to someone to warm up
for<00:06:01.450> me<00:06:01.570> for<00:06:01.720> six<00:06:01.900> months<00:06:01.990> but<00:06:02.680> this<00:06:02.860> has<00:06:03.130> the

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.160 
for me for six months but this has the

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.490 
for me for six months but this has the
capability<00:06:03.820> of<00:06:03.850> doing<00:06:03.970> that<00:06:04.450> the<00:06:04.870> 600

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 
capability of doing that the 600

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.110 
capability of doing that the 600
probably<00:06:05.920> isn't<00:06:06.130> going<00:06:06.250> to<00:06:06.340> go<00:06:06.460> much<00:06:06.790> further

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
probably isn't going to go much further

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.520 
probably isn't going to go much further
you're<00:06:07.750> probably<00:06:07.960> only<00:06:08.140> going<00:06:08.230> to<00:06:08.410> get

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:08.530 
you're probably only going to get

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.110 
you're probably only going to get
another<00:06:08.740> three<00:06:09.070> months<00:06:09.220> of<00:06:09.490> warming<00:06:09.820> on<00:06:09.940> top

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
another three months of warming on top

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.180 
another three months of warming on top
of<00:06:10.270> this<00:06:10.420> with<00:06:10.960> this<00:06:11.140> will<00:06:11.350> sound<00:06:11.590> really<00:06:11.650> nice

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:12.190 
of this with this will sound really nice

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.460 
of this with this will sound really nice
after<00:06:12.640> six<00:06:12.910> to<00:06:13.150> nine<00:06:13.330> months<00:06:13.660> or<00:06:13.750> so<00:06:13.990> after

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:14.470 
after six to nine months or so after

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.380 
after six to nine months or so after
three<00:06:14.950> months<00:06:15.250> that's<00:06:15.460> a<00:06:15.640> but<00:06:15.850> that's<00:06:16.210> all

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:16.390 
three months that's a but that's all

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.000 
three months that's a but that's all
you're<00:06:16.540> going<00:06:16.690> to<00:06:16.780> get<00:06:16.930> after<00:06:17.560> three<00:06:17.770> months

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.010 
you're going to get after three months

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.680 
you're going to get after three months
of<00:06:18.130> this<00:06:18.280> you<00:06:18.520> can<00:06:18.700> probably<00:06:18.910> warm<00:06:19.330> it<00:06:19.450> up<00:06:19.510> a

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:19.690 
of this you can probably warm it up a

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.300 
of this you can probably warm it up a
little<00:06:19.780> bit<00:06:19.990> more<00:06:20.170> and<00:06:20.410> then<00:06:20.680> some<00:06:20.980> more<00:06:21.160> after

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:21.310 
little bit more and then some more after

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.940 
little bit more and then some more after
that<00:06:21.520> so<00:06:21.940> this<00:06:22.540> is<00:06:22.930> this<00:06:23.260> will<00:06:23.470> last<00:06:23.680> you<00:06:23.890> a

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:23.950 
that so this is this will last you a

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.950 
that so this is this will last you a
little<00:06:24.160> bit<00:06:24.250> longer<00:06:24.430> so<00:06:24.580> you<00:06:24.970> were<00:06:25.090> doing<00:06:25.420> kind

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960 
little bit longer so you were doing kind

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.080 
little bit longer so you were doing kind
of<00:06:26.140> you're<00:06:26.410> you're<00:06:26.890> you're<00:06:27.190> much<00:06:27.550> much<00:06:27.850> harder

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090 
of you're you're you're much much harder

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.090 
of you're you're you're much much harder
padding<00:06:28.660> any<00:06:28.810> Kreisler<00:06:29.290> pieces<00:06:29.680> that<00:06:29.830> kind<00:06:30.010> of

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:30.100 
padding any Kreisler pieces that kind of

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.420 
padding any Kreisler pieces that kind of
thing

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.430 
thing

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:31.980 
thing
you<00:06:30.700> wanted<00:06:31.000> something<00:06:31.210> that<00:06:31.420> was<00:06:31.600> just<00:06:31.630> gonna

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:31.990 
you wanted something that was just gonna

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.830 
you wanted something that was just gonna
give<00:06:32.710> you<00:06:32.860> that<00:06:33.040> that<00:06:33.280> by<00:06:33.520> monistic<00:06:33.820> tone<00:06:34.300> then

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:34.840 
give you that that by monistic tone then

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.680 
give you that that by monistic tone then
the<00:06:34.930> 800<00:06:35.590> would<00:06:35.740> be<00:06:35.890> the<00:06:36.010> one<00:06:36.190> for<00:06:36.400> you<00:06:36.460> if<00:06:37.450> you

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:37.690 
the 800 would be the one for you if you

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.480 
the 800 would be the one for you if you
just<00:06:37.960> wanted<00:06:38.290> to<00:06:38.380> upgrade<00:06:38.530> for<00:06:39.100> sort<00:06:39.430> of

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:39.490 
just wanted to upgrade for sort of

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:43.020 
just wanted to upgrade for sort of
semi-professional<00:06:41.010> kind<00:06:42.010> of<00:06:42.070> violin<00:06:42.490> but

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:43.030 
semi-professional kind of violin but

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.900 
semi-professional kind of violin but
didn't<00:06:43.390> have<00:06:43.540> the<00:06:43.690> price<00:06:43.990> tag<00:06:44.350> for<00:06:44.430> 1,200<00:06:45.430> then

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:45.910 
didn't have the price tag for 1,200 then

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:47.400 
didn't have the price tag for 1,200 then
I<00:06:46.060> think<00:06:46.300> you're<00:06:46.420> not<00:06:46.630> going<00:06:46.780> to<00:06:46.870> go<00:06:46.960> far<00:06:47.200> on

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:47.410 
I think you're not going to go far on

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:49.140 
I think you're not going to go far on
with<00:06:47.530> the<00:06:47.620> 600<00:06:48.250> or<00:06:48.400> having<00:06:48.850> said<00:06:49.030> that

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:49.150 
with the 600 or having said that

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:50.909 
with the 600 or having said that
probably<00:06:49.360> the<00:06:49.570> 700<00:06:50.320> as<00:06:50.410> well<00:06:50.590> because<00:06:50.830> that's

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:50.919 
probably the 700 as well because that's

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:54.390 
probably the 700 as well because that's
so<00:06:51.100> need<00:06:51.960> $500<00:06:52.960> so<00:06:53.530> either<00:06:53.860> the<00:06:53.980> six<00:06:54.190> on<00:06:54.310> the

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:54.400 
so need $500 so either the six on the

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.670 
so need $500 so either the six on the
700<00:06:55.120> so<00:06:55.720> there<00:06:55.990> is<00:06:56.140> a<00:06:56.169> massive<00:06:56.410> difference

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:56.680 
700 so there is a massive difference

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.220 
700 so there is a massive difference
between<00:06:57.160> the<00:06:57.280> two<00:06:57.460> if<00:06:57.700> you<00:06:57.820> have<00:06:57.850> the<00:06:58.240> money<00:06:58.450> by

00:06:59.220 --> 00:06:59.230 
between the two if you have the money by

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:02.940 
between the two if you have the money by
the<00:06:59.290> 800<00:07:00.480> but<00:07:01.480> the<00:07:01.780> 600<00:07:02.290> is<00:07:02.350> still<00:07:02.560> really

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:02.950 
the 800 but the 600 is still really

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:05.640 
the 800 but the 600 is still really
going<00:07:03.190> to<00:07:03.310> fun<00:07:03.550> in<00:07:03.760> in<00:07:04.120> comparison<00:07:04.990> but<00:07:05.380> like<00:07:05.530> I

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:05.650 
going to fun in in comparison but like I

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:07.830 
going to fun in in comparison but like I
say<00:07:05.800> it<00:07:05.950> doesn't<00:07:06.160> have<00:07:06.430> as<00:07:06.550> much<00:07:06.730> the<00:07:07.030> 600<00:07:07.540> of

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:07.840 
say it doesn't have as much the 600 of

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.050 
say it doesn't have as much the 600 of
as<00:07:07.930> much<00:07:08.080> meat<00:07:08.350> or<00:07:08.500> guts<00:07:08.680> as<00:07:08.830> the<00:07:08.980> 800<00:07:09.490> and<00:07:09.640> the

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:10.060 
as much meat or guts as the 800 and the

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.870 
as much meat or guts as the 800 and the
800<00:07:10.510> is<00:07:10.540> going<00:07:10.720> to<00:07:10.810> push<00:07:11.050> a<00:07:11.260> lot<00:07:11.470> further<00:07:11.880> the

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:12.880 
800 is going to push a lot further the

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.540 
800 is going to push a lot further the
action<00:07:13.270> on<00:07:13.390> it<00:07:13.510> is<00:07:13.660> a<00:07:13.690> lot<00:07:13.870> nicer<00:07:14.550> combined

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:15.550 
action on it is a lot nicer combined

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:16.890 
action on it is a lot nicer combined
with<00:07:15.760> a<00:07:15.790> better<00:07:16.030> bow<00:07:16.240> you're<00:07:16.479> gonna<00:07:16.600> get<00:07:16.870> a

with a better bow you're gonna get a

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.380 
with a better bow you're gonna get a
much<00:07:17.350> not<00:07:18.160> just<00:07:18.190> a<00:07:18.460> nicer<00:07:18.669> tone<00:07:19.060> but<00:07:19.270> you're

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:19.390
