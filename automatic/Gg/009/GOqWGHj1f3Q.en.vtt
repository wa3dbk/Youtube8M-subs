 happy wishful and we are going to double click 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.409

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:19.729

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:21.990
 wiesel here we are going to drag it to 3 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:26.260
 player 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.260
 [Music] 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:36.090
 and good, the volume came down a bit here 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:37.080
 and this is the full version but let's go 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.570
 to do a little while 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:44.390
 it is very easy how to install it for example 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.390
 like here in a good one what 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.119
 for example that I do not project the 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.420
 hotel 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.810
 this 15 greens and we're going to click on play 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.810
 now 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.399
 a little one of the game world a 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.780
 small demonstration of how to play it 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.439
 play with the billets with the 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.439
 cheeks forgiveness 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:11.009
 in this special case and in this case 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.830
 to control the students with the 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.450
 little arrows as I said 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:19.760
 and squeeze space to slow down that the 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.740
 point of this game or the best it has 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.070
 this game is that your poor touch that 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:28.300
 it has and it's very fun to play it opens 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.300
 system you laugh too 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.740
 and we will see that it is lower 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.710
 there are some difficulties that we have to 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.920
 pass it ok the point of this game is 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:43.400
 arrive 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:48.290
 and obviously you do not have to go through that 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:51.700
 you can miss saying your arms 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.290
 legs but the site of the head is 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.019
 when it seems that we're going to give you 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:01.180
 a new skate machuca to return to 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.180
 play and let him see 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:15.430
 and we're going to give it to you as I said the girls 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:20.730
 the little arrows to advance in this case 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.730
 of the track that is in the one above that 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.700
 take care of what 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.730
 that nothing happens to your head 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.150
 but your arm but it's not there in the 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.150
 problem 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.110
 let's continue 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:49.530
 and runs runs 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:52.630
 well we are going to drag you kill 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.830
 and here 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.650
 or software 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:01.390
 there is one that allows you to choose all 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.390
 normal characters 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.090
 character 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:19.150
 although do not believe this game as I said 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.150
 has its version in its online version 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:26.230
 and good more than all the games when 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:28.900
 like when I'm studying well there's a 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.150
 free time or confessor takes in 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.870
 arrive and I go to the page to see or with 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.880
 a while and that was pretty well known 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.950
 when you there can enter the 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.170
 wise to also leave the link of the del 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:44.350
 game that is from the link of the page 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:46.450
 official and in which they will also be able to 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:50.460
 play really but as I said is the 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.460
 online version that is a bit different 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:01.110
 although they have grandpa is a bit 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:04.009
 difficult you should control it so 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.009
 It has some wheels 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:12.440
 but on the other 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:17.050
 well not a pallet deal there is a very 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:22.990
 good a stage and well this is the 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.990
 that allows you to choose other players 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:27.679
 we have two rats children who are there 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:35.040
 and good if you choose this with the key 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:35.040
 spaces to put fly 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:53.080
 how 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.620
 do not 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:11.790
 well this is very good as I said there is 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.409
 ones that allow you to see all the 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:14.969
 players 

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:16.949
 but this time I only want 

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:19.919
 show them this game and there's the 

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:22.769
 game if you never just download it as 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:23.999
 I said it has its touch word and good nothing 

00:06:22.769 --> 00:06:26.580
 more I hope you liked the game 

00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:28.949
