00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.769
 to start 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:12.289

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.749
 lego star wars with the first box 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:16.070

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.320
 it's just a surprise 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.910
 every day until Christmas Eve 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.350
 so each box will suit either a 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.410
 figure is a small seals in 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.970
 build so that's after what 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.839

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.640

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:35.109

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:35.109
